"An elderly couple who were violently beaten in their  home by a man on a deadly rampage across the neighborhood have died from their injuries just hours apart. Ann Taylor, 86, and husband, George Taylor, 80, were the victims of a horrific attack that left three others dead in the Kansas City suburb. Prosecutors allege that Brandon Howell beat the couple, then fatally shot three other people outside nearby homes before fleeing in the Taylors' SUV. Ann Taylor was taken off life support Monday night but lived until Tuesday, while her husband was removed from life support Tuesday morning and died soon after. 'George and Ann died peacefully and we are blessed that they left this Earth together,' family members said in a statement. 'They were married more than 40 years, and loved each other dearly.' Ann Taylor, 86, and husband, George Taylor, 80,taken off life support and died within hours of one another . The couple's devastated family gathered together on Friday to ask for prayers as Ann and George fought for their lives. 'We are heartbroken over this tragedy. The family is in complete shock,' said a niece who asked reporters not to reveal her name as she spoke in the Taylors' driveway. 'We cannot understand how such a heinous crime could happen to two such wonderful and kindhearted people,' she added, according to a report in the Kansas City Star. 'We have cried many tears, but with each day we feel a little more strength to face an unknown future.' Saturday afternoon, Jackson County Prosecutor Jean Peters Baker announced that Howell has been formally charged with three counts of first-degree murder. Howell, a convicted felon, was arrested hours after the attack on the Taylors when police found him walking with a loaded shotgun in his pants. The 34-year-old ex-convict also faces three counts of armed criminal action, two counts of first-degree assault, burglary, motor vehicle theft and felon in possession of a firearm. A niece of the Taylors  said the family was devastated and confused by the vicious attack . Former convict Brandon Howell, 34, pictured left in Wednesday's booking photo and right in a previous mugshot, has been charged with murder in connection to the killings . Neighbors believe that the Hursts and Choucroun were killed because they prevented the gunman from stealing this vintage Jaguar from a nearby home . The other victims of the shootings were identified as Lorene Hurst, 88; her son, Darrel Hurst, 63; and Susan Choucroun, 69, all deceased. The pain of those victim's families was also given a moment in the statement. 'Our family would like to send our love, our thoughts, to the relatives and friends of Ann’s and George’s neighbors who tragically lost their lives that day,' the niece read. 'We believe they were killed trying to support Ann and George, and we are forever grateful.' She also expressed gratitude to the local police, ambulance crews, medics, and the doctors now caring for the Taylors. 'We have all the faith in the world they are doing everything they can to save Ann and George.' she said. She also thanked the community for their support. 'Even in these troubled times, it is so heartwarming to see the entire community come together over this senseless crime that could affect any one of us,' she said. Family members said the Taylors created a blended family with each having children from previous marriages: three adult children to George and two adult children to Ann. They shared several grandchildren and great-grandchildren. 'We cannot understand how such a heinous crime could happen to two such wonderful and kindhearted people,' the family wrote about the Taylors in a statement . Innocent bystanders: Lorene Hurst, 88 (left), her son Darrel Hurst, 63 (center), and neighbor Susan Choucroun, 69 (right) have been identified as victims in a Kansas City triple homicide . Police arrested 34-year-old Howell in connection with the motel attacks . They had lived on Woodbridge Lane for the last five years and spent nearly their entire lives in the Kansas City area. Fox 4 KC reported that Ann was an entrepreneur and Red Hat society member while George was a veteran, brick mason, and huge sports fan. The shootings Tuesday afternoon took place in two homes in a middle-class neighborhood. The Hurst family said in a statement that Darrel was visiting his mother. ‘While we are unsure of all the events that transpired that day, but we are comforted knowing they are together,’ the statement said. ‘Our prayers go out to the other families and victims in the neighborhood as they are struggling to deal with their grief as well. Our hearts are broken and we ask for privacy during this difficult time.’ A couple of hours after the afternoon killing spree Tuesday, police learned that three people at a Motel 6 near I-29 and Barry Road had been physically assaulted, and another was nearly carjacked. The police statement said no weapon was used in those assaults. In the course of the investigation, police found a 2002 Toyota Highlander that had been stolen from one of the crime scenes. According to a statement from the Hurst family, Darrel Hurst (right) was visiting his elderly mother (left) at the time of the fatal shootings in the Kansas City suburb . Charles Choucroun tearfully recalled the moment he was told his wife, Susan, was among the casualties . Shortly before midnight, officers arrested Brandon Howell, whom they positively identified as a suspect in the motel assaults, according to a police statement. Responding police officers also seized a gun from the suspect at the time of his arrest, Fox 4 KC reported. According to the shooting victims' neighbors, the deadly spree resulted from a botched robbery. Local residents speaking to the news channel said that Susan Choucroun and the Hursts spotted a man trying to steal a vintage Jaguar from their neighbors' house on Woodbridge Lane. Not knowing that the would-be car thief was armed with a shotgun, the victims came up to him as he was trying to drive away and were shot at a point-blank range. The gunman then jumped into a Toyota Highlander belonging to the couple he had beaten up and took off from the scene. Neighbor Vicki Gruver, 74, described Lorene Hurst as a lovely lady who enjoyed travel, and Darrel Hurst as a doting son. Susan Choucroun is survived by her husband, Charles, who owns a beauty salon in Prairie Village. The elderly man was not home at the time of the tragedy. Investigators were called to this Motel 6 just four blocks from where the missing SUV was found after getting reports of three assaults and a carjacking . Police found this 2002 Toyota Highlander that was stolen from one of the crime scenes in Kansas City . Speaking to Fox4 KC, the devastated man tearfully recounted how he came home Tuesday only to discover crime scene tape around his block. One of the police officers on the scene broke the news to him that his wife was among the victims. More details also emerged today about the violent past of the man at the center of the triple murder investigation. Brandon Howell was accused in the late 1990s of killing two teenagers in Johnson County, but in 2009 a jury found him not guilty. The 34-year-old also has a prior conviction in connection to a 1999 burglary where a cat named Tony was beheaded. He was released on parole in 2011. Tom Brewer, the father of 16-year-Tabitha Brewer who was killed along with her boyfriend, Nick Travis, 18, in 1998, told the Kansas City Star Wednesday that when he saw Howell's picture on TV, he immediately recognized him as the man who was acquitted in his daughter's murder. ‘I feel sorry for the jurors who acquitted him the last time because that is going to be hard for them to live with,’ Brewer said. ‘I believe justice is always served one way or another.’ The triple homicide - the most deadly incident Kansas City has seen in more than two years - left people living in the middle-class neighborhood shaken. ‘In the last few years we’ve had many young families move in. It is a very, very desirable place to live,’ Jo Lombardino, a member of the Woodbridge Homes Association, told the newspaper.

"The asylum seeker policy debate is settled, the coalition has stopped the boats and it's time to move on, Immigration Minister Scott Morrison will declare. In a major speech to the National Press Club on Wednesday to mark one year since the beginning of Operation Sovereign Borders, Mr Morrison will say the 'grand policy experiment' of the last decade is over. 'It's the coalition policies that effectively stopped the boats,' he is expected to say. 'That argument, that debate is settled and it's time to move on.' Immigration Minister Scott Morrison is expected to declare an end to the asylum seeker policy debate in a speech at the National Press Club . Mr Morrison told ABC radio that Labor's policies had 'completely failed' but the coalition was fixing the problem. 'We're well on the road to doing that,' he said. 'I think we can now move on in this debate.' The speech comes after recent revelations about 'filthy' living conditions at Australia's immigration centre compounds on Manus Island in Papua New Guinea. Former detention centre guard Beau Mitchell took photographs of the 'filthy' living conditions before he quit his job in disgust. Mr Mitchell told the ABC that he wasn't surprised Iranian asylum seeker Hamid Kehazaei died from an infection he caught at the detention centre. Mr Kehazaei, 24, is believed to have spent days seeking treatment for a cut on his foot that had been there for weeks whilst he was detained at Manus Island. Iranian asylum seeker Hamid Kehazaei, 24, died as a result of an infection in a cut in his foot caught at Australia's immigration detention centre at Manus Island . He was initially transferred to a Port Moresby hospital to treat his septicaemia, where he had a heart attack before being sent to Brisbane. He was then declared brain dead at Mater Private Hospital before his family made the heartbreaking decision to turn off his life support last Friday. Mr Morrison has rejected suggestions the care provided to Mr Kehazaei was inadequate. Opposition immigration spokesman Richard Marles has said Labor continues to be concerned about the lack of transparency surrounding the treatment of asylum seekers.","Immigration minister to give major speech to National Press Club today .

"It takes just a few hours for a virus to spread through an office building, hotel or healthcare facility, according to a new study. U.S. researchers found that when they contaminated a single doorknob or table top with a 'tracer virus' it spread within two to four hours. Their findings showed 40 to 60 per cent of workers as well as visitors were infected after touching objects in the building. U.S. researchers found that it took just two to four hours for a virus to spread through an office, hotel or healthcare facility after a doorknob or table top was contaminated . However, scientists found that using disinfectant wipes containing quartenary ammonium compounds (QUATS) reduced the spread of the virus by 80 to 99 per cent. In the study, researchers used  tracer virus bacteriophage MS-2 which mimicked the nasty stomach bug norovirus, as it is similar in shape, size and is similarly resistant to disinfectants. Norovirus, known as the winter vomiting bug, is the most common stomach bug in the UK and is highly contagious. As part of the new study, the virus was placed on one or two commonly touched surfaces like a door know or table top at the beginning of the day in office buildings, conference room and a health care facility. After various time period between two to eight hours the scientists sampled 60 to 100 fomites, surfaces capable of carrying infections organisms and found that within two to four hours 40 to 60 percent of the foimites were contaminated with the virus. Foimites included light switches, bed rails, table tops, countertops, push buttons, coffee pot handles, sink tap handles, door knobs, phones and computer equipment. Norovirus, sometimes known as the winter vomiting bug, is the most common stomach bug in the UK. The virus is highly contagious. It can affect people of all ages and causes vomiting and diarrhoea. There's no specific cure for norovirus, so you have to let it run its course. It's usually mild and shouldn't last more than a couple of days. The period from when you're infected to when you start to show symptoms (the incubation period) usually lasts between 12 and 48 hours. You may be infectious to other people during this time. Although having norovirus can be unpleasant, it's not usually dangerous and most people make a full recovery within a couple of days without having to see their GP. Source: NHS Choices . When employees were provided with wipes containing QUATS disinfectants and told to use at least once daily, the number of fomites on which the virus was detected was reduced by 80 per cent or more. Professor Charles Gerba, of the University of Arizona in Tuscon, U.S., said: 'Within two to four hours between 40 to 60 per cent of the fomites sampled were contaminated with virus. 'The results shown that viral contamination of fomites in facilities occurs quickly, and that a simple intervention can greatly help to reduce exposure to viruses. 'Using disinfecting wipes containing quaternary ammonium compounds (QUATS) registered by EPA as effective against viruses like norovirus and flu, along with hand hygiene, reduced virus spread by 80 to 99 per cent.' The research was presented at the the 54th Interscience Conference on Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy (ICAAC), an infectious disease meeting of the American Society for Microbiology. Researchers used a 'tracer virus' similar to norovirus, and found that using disinfectant wipes containing quartenary ammonium compounds (QUATS) reduced the spread of the virus by 80 - 99 per cent .","It took just two to four hours for a virus to spread through a building .

"Dashing at frenetic speeds through woodland and instinctively reacting to its remarkable sense of smell a beagle dog demonstrates his innate sniffing ability in this fascinating new GoPro video. During the two minute footage, Ember, a lemon beagle, reacts decisively to follow a hunt trail and track down a synthetic scent left by a hunt-master. A wearable GoPro was attached to Ember's back in order to capture  the unique  point-of-view footage in the South African countryside. At the beginning of the video the dog is unleashed in a grassland area and he immediately dashes off vigorously towards a country road where he follows the trail of the scent towards a wooded area. The beagle is then seen running for one and a half minutes and he stops momentarily on just a few occasions for an additional sniff before quickly running on again. After one minute and 33 seconds the dog runs into a group of people and he is warmly congratulated on successfully following the scent trail and completing the challenge.

"Gaining just five pounds can lead to an increase in blood pressure, a new study has found . Gaining just a small amount of weight can put people at risk of raised blood pressure, a new study has found. Researchers found people who put on just five pounds saw their blood pressure rise. Many people are aware of the health implications of being severely overweight or obese, but scientists at the Mayo Clinic in the U.S. wanted to see the impact of small weight gain of five to 11 pounds. Lead author Dr Naima Covassin, said: 'To our knowledge, for the first time, we showed that the blood pressure increase was specifically related to increases in abdominal visceral fat, which is the fat inside the abdomen. 'Our research suggests that healthy people who are more likely to gain weight in the stomach area are also more likely to have their blood pressure increased.' At the beginning of the eight-week study, a 24-hour monitor tested the blood pressure of 16 normal weight people. Researchers fed them an extra 400 to 1,200 calories each day with their choice of an ice cream shake, chocolate bar or energy drink to increase their weight by about five per cent. Afterwards, their blood pressure was taken for another 24-hour period. Their results were compared to 10 normal weight, healthy people who maintained the same weight over the eight weeks. The researchers found those who gained weight had a systolic blood pressure (top number) increase from an average 114 mm Hg to an average 118 mm Hg. Those who gained more weight inside their abdomen had a greater blood pressure increase. However, a five to 11 pound weight gain did not affect cholesterol, insulin or blood sugar levels. The study was conducted in healthy people aged 18 to 48. Dr Covassin said further studies will need to be conducted to see if the results are similar in different age groups, those with a family history of high blood pressure and other groups. 'The public awareness of the adverse health effects of obesity is increasing; however, it seems most people are not aware of the risks of a few extra pounds,' added Dr Covassin. 'This is an important finding because a five to seven-pound weight gain may be normal for many during the holiday season, the first year of college or even while on vacation.' The research was presented at the American Heart Association's High Blood Pressure Research Scientific Sessions. Researchers at the Mayo Clinic in the U.S. found a five to 11 pound weight gain did not affect cholesterol, insulin or blood sugar levels. Dr Naima Covassin, said: 'This is an important finding because a five to seven-pound weight gain may be normal for many during the holiday season, the first year of college or  on vacation'","Mayo Clinic study found gaining five to 11 pounds increases blood pressure .

"At first they said they wouldn't but The Broadway League dimmed their lights on Tuesday night for Joan Rivers in the city that never sleeps. Hundreds of New York theatergoers and passersby stopped to see the dimmed lights of the theater marquees, just one day after The Broadway League said that TV personality Joan Rivers didn't officially qualify as a Broadway star. 'Joan Rivers loved Broadway and we loved her. Due to the outpouring of love and respect for Joan Rivers from our community and from her friends and fans worldwide, the marquees of Broadway theaters in New York will be dimmed in her memory tonight, at exactly 6:45pm for one minute,' said Charlotte St. Martin, Executive Director of The Broadway League before the much anticipated event.

"More than 400 injured servicemen and women will line up to take part in the Invictus Games this week. For each of them, competing in the Games is the latest turn in a long road to recovery from devastating injuries sustained in war. Among them will be British Royal Marine Reservist Lance Corporal John James Chalmers, whose arms were blown to pieces in an IED attack in Afghanistan in 2011. Scroll down for video . Lance Corporal John James Chalmers had his arm grafted to his stomach as part of his long treatment after he was caught up in an IED explosion in Afghanistan in 2011. He is now set to compete in the Invictus Games . Lance Corporal Chalmers was serving as a Royal Marine reservist with 42 Commando in Helmand province when he was injured in the blast, which killed two of his comrades . He was flown home after the attack - which killed two of his comrades - and, after waking up in a British hospital, has since undergone nearly 30 operations. The 26-year-old, from Edinburgh, is still having treatment and will only be able to compete thanks to an operation which saw his arm sewn to his stomach for six weeks. Lance Corporal Chalmers lost two fingers, had his right elbow destroyed and suffered facial and leg injuries in the blast in May 2011. Describing the moments after the explosion, he told the Daily Mirror: 'I went to move one of my arms after I was hit and it just wasn't there – it was hanging off. 'Then I brought my other hand up and I saw all of my fingers either gone or hanging off and I just thought; 'What can I do for myself now?'' After an agonizing wait for help to arrive, Lance Corporal Chalmers - known to friends as 'JJ'- was rescued and flown home, waking up 10 days later in hospital in Birmingham surrounded by his family. Despite initially hoping he might be able to return to the front to fight, the intervening years have been a hard battle through a series of operations, some up to 14 hours long. As well as having tissue transplanted from his leg to his arm, he also had his arm grafted to his midriff, in what he describes as a 'sling created out of my own skin'. Lance Corporal Chalmers has undergone a long road to recovery after his legs, arms and face were injured . The commando - pictured before he was caught up in the explosion - is planning to get married after the Games . Three years after the blast which nearly killed him, Lance Corporal Chalmers is now preparing to compete in the cycling, volleyball and athletics in the Games, which start in London tonight. The Games will kick off a year of celebration for the commando, who is planning to marry fiancée Kornelia Chitrusko, 27, in the New Year. He said: 'The Invictus Games have given a whole international community of wounded, injured and sick servicemen and women something to strive for. 'For us it's about much more than four days of sport. We'll be ready to show our Invictus spirit in the sporting arena. 'That all starts with the opening ceremony and we hope the public will be there to give us their support. It promises to be quite a show and will set the tone for what's to come.' The opening ceremony will feature a flypast from the Red Arrows over the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park in London this evening. The 5,000-strong audience will include Prince Harry, his brother the Duke of Cambridge, their father the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall. After gathering on the south lawn of the park, they will watch a competitors' parade, as well as displays by the King's Troop Royal Horse Artillery and the Queen's Colour Squadron, and bands from the Royal Marines, Army and RAF. Lance Corporal Chalmers (seventh from the right) is one of over 400 heroes taking part in the Games . Prince Harry, who has championed the Games, meets members of the Australian team at a reception today . The Duchess of Cambridge, who is expecting her second child and is suffering from acute morning sickness, will not be able to attend. The Invictus Games have been championed by Harry and backed by William and Kate as well as the Ministry of Defence. Over four days, both serving military personnel and veterans from 13 nations will go head to head in nine adaptive sports in London. Teams have travelled from the USA, Denmark, Estonia, France and Italy, Canada, Holland, Australia, Afghanistan, Georgia, New Zealand and Germany for the games, which were inspired by the United States' Warrior Games. Harry confessed to a few 'sleepless nights' in the run-up to the games, but said he had been humbled by the experience. He said: 'I think everyone should be humbled. The reaction I have seen today for all the organising committee has reminded us exactly why we have done this. The difference it's going to make for these guys to be part of these games is huge. For British Armed Forces team captain Dave Henson (pictured, right), the Invictus Games is a showcase for what injured servicemen and women can do. The 29-year-old, who lost his legs when he was blown up by an IED in Helmand Province in 2011, is competing in the sitting volleyball at the Games, as well as the 100m and 200m. He said: 'I want people to think ""Yes, that was a fantastic competition"", but also, ""These servicemen and women are something else, what can we do to make sure that this display and show of strength of character is a regular occurrence?"". 'I want people to be thinking ""What else can these guys do if we start giving them jobs or other focus - what else can they achieve?"". 'Most of all, I want people to see that we're here, and recognise these military guys and girls.' Mr Henson, from the Royal Engineers, said it was a 'huge honour' to have been selected to captain Britain's team, which he insists is looking good and is 'raring to go'. He said his own training has gone well, adding: 'I'm slightly ahead of where I thought I was going to be for the 200m, which is good. 'I feel strong, I just hope I don't fall over. It's always a risk when you're running on two blades.' Mr Henson, from Southampton, told how sport had helped him in his own journey to recovery, along with many of his team-mates. He said: 'It's something I found since these Games were announced in March, you see people on their different journeys. 'You can see a change in someone from a year ago, it really can play such a positive role in someone's recovery, it's fantastic to see.' The military-themed opening ceremony is set to take place outside London's Olympic stadium later today . The Games have been put together by Prince Harry, pictured greeting American Servicemen earlier this week . Ahead of the opening ceremony, Defence Secretary Michael Fallon said: 'This is a momentous day for the British team who demonstrate the remarkable spirit and determination that defines our Armed Forces. 'They are testament to the excellent care and support that is available through our world-renowned Defence Rehabilitation process.' 'Our Armed Forces have played a major role in making the Games happen - not just our inspiring competitors but also the 500 service personnel in a wide range of roles who will be supporting their comrades.' Barack Obama has wished the teams well in a video message of support for wounded servicemen and women. In a pre-recorded message played to teams ahead of the Games, the US President said : 'I know it's going to be a fiercely competitive few days but the truth is that everyone of you in these games, every service member and veteran, has already earned our highest admiration and our deepest gratitude. 'When your countries asked you to serve, to risk everything to protect our safety and our freedom, you and your families answered the call and just as you inspire us with your courage on the battlefield, your grit and resilience when you take the playing field, your incomparable souls inspire us today.'

"A gold engagement ring from the 17th Century has been unearthed by a pensioner with a metal detector - more than 300 years after it was lost. Tom Ross, 69, was sweeping his metal detector over a ploughed farmer's field near Newtownabbey in County Antrim, Northern Ireland, when he stumbled across the item. The rare 'posy' ring, which dates back to the late 1600s and is 85 per cent gold, bears the Old English inscription 'I noght on gift bot gifer', or 'Look not on the gift, but the giver'. Scroll down for video . Rare: This 'posy' ring was unearthed by Tom Ross, 69, in a farmer's field near Newtownabbey, County Antrim . Also known as a 'betrothal' ring, it pre-dates the custom of proposing with an engagement ring, but essentially served the same purpose. Men and women exchanged the items from the 1500s onwards to symbolise their future commitment to each other. Mr Ross, from Jordanstown, near Belfast, told a treasure trove inquest at Belfast Coroners' Court that he initially thought his find in September last year was a worthless trinket. 'I thought it was a bit of rubbish,' the great-grandfather and retired oil distributor told coroner Suzanne Anderson. Treasure hunter: Mr Ross (left), from Jordanstown, near Belfast, initially thought the gold ring (right) was a worthless trinket. But a coroner at Belfast Coroners' Court later declared the finding was officially treasure . Romantic message: The ring, which dates back to the late 1600s and is 85 per cent gold, bears the Old English inscription 'I noght on gift bot gifer' (pictured), or 'Look not on the gift, but the giver' He later added: 'In the last 60 years there have been funfairs on that field, motorbike racing, point to point racing. There has been a lot of activity there so I thought that's where it came from.' 'Posy' rings pre-date the custom of proposing with an engagement ring, but essentially served the same purpose. Men and women exchanged the items - also known as 'betrothal' rings - from the 1500s ownwards to symbolise their future commitment to each other. The rings, which were often swapped at betrothals and weddings, were typically gold with a short inscription on their innner surface. The quotations were often from contemporary courtship stories or 'chapbooks'. However, the notion of an 'engagement' ring can be traced as far back as ancient Rome . Back then, Roman brides-to-be were given two rings: a gold one to wearin publi, and one made of iron to wear at home while attending to household duties. Diamonds were too rare and expensive for most people to afford in a ring until the discovery of African diamond mines in the 1870s. Even then, they were for a long time seen as the domain of the nobility and aristocracy, with many favouring simpler engagement bands. It was only after Mr Ross, who took up metal detecting four years ago as a hobby, showed the ring to a fellow treasure hunter in England that he realised it could be valuable. He passed the item to museum experts in Northern Ireland who were able to establish its true significance. Elise Taylor, curator of applied art at National Museums Northern Ireland, told the court that the ring was originally coated in black and white glass, most of which had worn off in the centuries since. She said it was tradition to have an inscription on the rings and explained that the name Posy related to the French word for poem - poesy. The jewellery expert outlined to Ms Anderson one theory as to how the ring ended up the field in Ballywalter near Newtownabbey. 'There was evidence of a church and graveyard in the adjoining field which could have been there at that period of time so many people would have traversed over this field to get to,' she said. Explaining that the ring was very light, Ms Taylor speculated that the owner may not even have realised it had dropped from her finger. 'In the cold weather fingers shrink and rings can be lost,' she said. 'Quite possibly she would not have noticed the ring was lost until she got home.' Ms Anderson declared the ring to be officially treasure - a ruling that means the item will now be handed over to the British Museum for valuation. Scene: Elise Taylor, curator of applied art at National Museums Northern Ireland, told the court that the ring was originally coated in black and white glass. Above, the item was found in a field near Newtownabbey (pictured) 'Very many congratulations and well done for making such a lovely find Mr Ross,' she said. However, Mr Ross will not be able to hang up his metal detector just yet. In an amusing twist, after the inquest, the pensioner revealed that when Ms Taylor accompanied him back to the field earlier this year to examine the site she lost her own earring. 'I am going to have to go back and have a look for it now,' Mr Ross laughed.","Tom Ross, 69, discovered ring in field near Newtonabbey, Northern Ireland .

"They are Harry’s Heroes: servicemen and women injured in the line of duty. And 130 of them are in the British military team at the inaugural Invictus Games — the brainchild of Prince Harry. They will compete in London this week against wounded personnel from 13 other nations. Here, five of them share their stories with KATHRYN KNIGHT. My arm was sewn into my stomach . John ‘JJ’ Chalmers, 26, was serving in Afghanistan as a Marine Reservist when he was injured by an improvised explosive device (IED) in May 2011. He lives in Edinburgh with fiancée Kornelia Chitrusko, 27, and will compete in a cycling event in the Games. JJ says: . ‘When I woke in hospital in Birmingham ten days after the attack the problem was that while I was intact, nothing worked: the blast crushed my face, broke my neck, injured both legs and smashed my arms to pieces.’ Scroll down for video . John 'JJ' Chalmers, 26, was serving in Afghanistan as a Marine Reservist when he was improvised by an improvised explosive device (IED) in May 2011 . Doctors saved JJ’s right arm — from which a large chunk had been gouged — by using skin from his midriff. They cut open his abdomen and folded the loose flap of skin over his arm before sewing it in place inside. ‘It was like a sling created out of my own skin,’ JJ explains. The damaged arm remained there for six weeks, attached to the blood supply of the abdomen. ‘Over the weeks they cut small sections of the flap away and each time, my body learned to pump more blood directly into my arm, and a bit less to it through my abdomen. At the end of it, they separated them completely, and the wound on my arm is covered with skin from my abdomen.’ I lost three limbs but cycled to Paris . Josh Boggi, 28, Corporal (rtd) 9 Parachute Squadron, Royal Engineers lost his legs and his right arm when he stepped on an IED in Afghanistan. He lives in Salisbury with girlfriend Anna, 27. He says: . ‘I’d done three tours to Afghanistan when I stepped on an IED on New Year’s Eve 2010. One minute I was on the floor, the next I was in a ditch, but it wasn’t until the lads started applying tourniquets that I realised I’d been injured. Josh Boggi, 28, Corporal (rtd) 9 Parachute Squadron, Royal Engineers, lost his legs and his right arm when he stepped on an IED in Afghanistan . ‘I lost three limbs, but from the start I knew acceptance was the key to moving forward. Life goes on and you have to make the best of it. I spent the first year adapting to what had happened, but by last year I knew I needed something else — the question, with my injuries, was what? ‘Then I discovered cycling. Six weeks after I first got on a bike I cycled from London to Paris for Help for Heroes. Being part of a team was the best part — it replaces some of what you lose when you leave the Army. ‘Now I’m training to be a Paralympic cyclist and I see a wheelchair as a set of handcuffs.’ I'm back to being the man I used to be . Craig Gadd, 41, Sergeant, Royal Engineers. A reservist, Craig lost his left leg after being hit by an IED on his second tour of Afghanistan in 2010. He lives in Hull with his fiancée, Dolly Dalton, 45, and their child. He says: . ‘I had convinced my family my job was one of the safest — I wasn’t poking about looking for IEDs but making tactical decisions about the best way to move our men. But it still took me out into the field and I was unlucky. Craig Gadd, 41, Sergeant, Royal Engineers. A reservist, Craig lost his left leg after being hit by an IED on his second tour of Afghanistan in 2010 . ‘Coming round in hospital was a culture shock. I loved skiing, riding my motorbike, and you think all this stuff has been ripped away from you. I remember taking a shower and looking in a mirror for the first time at where my leg had been and there were a couple of tears. After that, though, I just got on with it — my fiancée was seven months pregnant and we had a baby to think of. ‘Now I’m part of the cycling team for the Invictus Games and I’m part of the Combined Services Disabled Ski Team. It’s helped take me back to the person I was before.’ The doctors thought I was dead . Derek Derenalagi, 39, Lance Corporal 2nd Battalion Mercian Regiment, became only the second soldier to lose both his legs in Afghanistan when his vehicle detonated an IED in July 2007. Originally from Fiji, he remains in the Army as part of their Elite Sports Regiment and lives in Hertfordshire with wife Anna, 23, and their two children. Derek says: . ‘After the explosion I looked down and saw I was lying in a pool of blood with both my legs gone. I thought I would go home in a coffin — and I nearly did. Derek Derenalagi, 39, Lance Corporal 2nd Battalion Mercian Regiment, became only the second soldier to lose both his legs in Afghanistan when his vehicle detonated an IED in July 2007 . ‘I was pronounced dead at the hospital in Camp Bastion, until one doctor detected a tiny pulse. Somehow, I got a second chance. ‘It took me a while to accept I had lost my legs. Back in 2007 my injury was rare: there was no road map, no one to inspire me. ‘Watching the Beijng Paralympics in 2008 was a turning point. I realised I, too, could be an elite sportsman if I found the right discipline. I bought a discus, trained myself in the back garden and four years later I represented our country at London’s 2012 Paralympics. ‘The pride you feel is immense, and I believe it will be similar at the Invictus Games.’ This shows there's life after injury . Vinod Budhathoki, 29, Gurkha (rtd) First Royal Gurkha Rifles, lost his legs and an index finger in May 2010 after stepping on an IED while on patrol in Helmand Province. He lives in Maidstone with wife Sanita, 26 and their two children. Vinod says: . ‘Although what happened to me was horrendous, in some ways it was harder for my wife. Vinod Budhathoki, 29, Gurkha (rtd) First Royal Gurkha Rifles, lost his legs and an index finger in May 2010 after stepping on an IED while on patrol in Helmand Province . ‘My mind had already accepted that something bad might happen, but she was back at home, four months pregnant with our first child. However, when our daughter came along, we were so busy there was no time to dwell on what had happened. ‘Of course, part of me misses my old life, but sport has been a huge positive — it shows you there is life beyond injury. Now I ride a hand-bike, powered by my arms, and play sitting volleyball. Sometimes I miss my legs — I know I won’t be able to climb mountains in Nepal again — but in a funny way what happened opened up a new world of opportunities.’ You can still buy tickets for the Invictus Games at www.invictusgames.org.

"A woman who was glassed by a stranger has released pictures of her injuries in a fury after her attacker walked free from court. Caitlin Morrell, 21, was on a night out with a friend when Stephanie Murfet thrust a glass tumbler into her face. Murfet, 22, was handed a suspended jail sentence at Cambridge Crown Court. Caitlin Morrell, 21, was enjoying a night out in Ely with a friend when Stephanie Murfet, 22, (right) described by bar staff as 'the short, frumpy one', pushed a tumbler in her face, leaving a deep gash beside her nose, right . But Miss Morrell, who has a scar across her cheek, said she showed no remorse. She said: ‘She walked out past the public gallery and that’s the first time I’d seen her since she glassed me. She didn’t look at me but she was smiling. That made my blood boil.’ She added that she ‘felt like her brain had exploded’ in the attack at the Townhouse pub in Ely on February 22. Miss Morrell had had an altercation with a friend who had started seeing her ex. Shortly afterwards, Murfet – who she had never met – pushed a glass into her face. Miss Morrell, of Ely, Cambridgeshire, said: ‘This little thing was in my face having a go at me. I literally didn’t know who she was. ‘The bar staff described me as the tall blonde in a bright blazer and they described her as the short, frumpy one.’ She said she had been told Murfet attacked her because she was jealous of her. She added that the attack left her so traumatised her hair started to fall out. She said: ‘I couldn’t sleep. Every time I tried to I would see a glass coming towards my face. My mum was heartbroken. We cried a lot.’ Miss Morrell was forced to delay her training as a hairdresser, which she has now completed. She said: ‘I don’t want her to affect my life any more.’ Murfet, of Littleport, Cambridgeshire, admitted assault and was given a 21-month sentence, suspended for 18 months, on Monday. Judge Gareth Hawkesworth said she ‘has never been in trouble and it seems to be out of character’. Murfet was also given 200 hours’ unpaid work and must pay £750 compensation and £250 costs. The unprompted attack left Miss Morrell with a large scar and also destroyed the hairdresser's confidence .","Caitlin Morrell, 21, was on night out in Ely with friend when she was glassed .

"This is the 'incredible' moment humpback dolphins were caught on camera strand-feeding in Australia for the first time. The footage was caught by marine researcher Dr Daniele Cagnazzi and his team as part of a long running study by Southern Cross University. It shows the dolphin beaching itself on a mud bank to catch fish which have been washed up from the river. Dr Cagnazzi said it was large splashes in the distance that attracted the team's attention to the rare behaviour. This is the first time footage showing humpback dolphins strand-feeding in the estuary on the Fitzroy River . Professor Peter Harrison from Southern Cross Univesity said the event was 'significant' This amazing image shows a group of dolphins strand-feeding is the US . He said: ''We soon realised we were witnessing an incredible event. The humpback dolphins were observed swimming a few metres away from and parallel to the shoreline. 'This behaviour probably allows dolphins to concentrate fish against the mud bank before charging at them at high speed. 'On some occasions the fish were washed onto the shoreline by the wave of water associated with the dolphin's beaching, resulting in a full body exposed beaching. Dr Cagnazzi, originally from Italy, has been been studying the dolphins of Queensland for a decade . 'On other occasions the stranding was only partial with more than half of their body exposed. 'In these shallow waters the agility of the dolphin's neck region enabled them to reach for the stranded fish before sliding back into the deeper water, thanks to the soft mud substrate.' The fish being 'rounded up' by the dolphins were sea mullet. This is the biggest study of its kind looking into rare dolphin species in Queensland. This is the biggest study of its kind looking into rare dolphin species in in the Queensland region . Dr Cagnazzi leads the Capricorn Cetaceans Research Team at Southern Cross University and he explained dolphins around the world use a number of foraging strategies. 'One of the most spectacular and rare behaviours is the 'strand-feeding' or 'intentional beach hunting' which involves one or more dolphins surging partially or fully out of the water and onto the beach to catch a single fish,' he said. These dolphins are in the Fitzroy River which is one of Australia's largest rivers and is a tide-dominated estuary. Kate McQueen says it is 'really important' we know and understand as much as possible about the dolphins . The area features a network of narrow deep creeks and channels with steep muddy edges, providing the perfect habitat for the display of this behaviour. Researchers from overseas are also taking part in the investigation into the declining dolphin population. Kate McQueen, 23, from a small village in rural Scotland has made the trip Down Under especially to study the dolphins. Fiona Wardle described it as an 'incredible experience' to witness the strandfeeding . She told 7.30 Queensland: 'It is really important because the more we know then we can understand what changes will impact them and how the population will change. Marine photographer Fiona Wardle, from Cornwall, England has been out in Queensland for the last two months taking part in the study. She said: 'The snubfin dolphin was only found to be a new species in 2005 so there is still a lot to learn, in the last two months I have witnessed the strand -feeding and it is something new. Students from Southern Cross University in Queensland tracking the progress of the dolphins . 'It was an incredible experience to watch, it was something I have only witnessed on documentaries.' Dr Cagnazzi said: 'You need to be in the right place at the right time (to see the dolphins), it is not easy.' Paul Birch, Fitzroy Bain Association assistant chief executive, told 7.30 Queensland: ''He (Dr Cagnazzi)  is now known as an expert in looking after the dolphin populations in the local are. Marine photographer Fiona Wardle, from Cornwall, England has been out in Queensland for two months . 'We have got a lot of statistics over the years and he is gathering great data that will be used for many years to come.' Professor Peter Harrison, director of the university's Marine Ecology Research Centre, said the observation by the Capricorn Cetaceans Research Team was 'significant'. 'These new observations of complex feeding behaviours in inshore dolphins highlights the lack of knowledge we have about key aspects of the ecology and biology of these important dolphins and most other cetacean species in Australian waters.' The study has also found the region's humpback dolphins, previously known as the Indo-Pacific dolphin species, have dropped from around 200 to 150.","It is the first time  humpback dolphins have been captured on video strand-feeding in Australia .

"Successful IT expert Martin Strain, 34, was found dead on 1 August - he was waiting to see a consultant about his depression . A loving husband in despair at being told he had to wait  months to see a specialist for depression was found dead, his family said today. Martin Strain, 34, from Batley, West Yorkshire, seemed 'jolly' and put on a mask, but was in fact suffering acute mental illness, his parents said. The IT expert had been signed off work with the condition since February and was on antidepressants prescribed by his doctor.  He had also seen his company doctor, who noted that with proper treatment he should make a full recovery. In April, Mr Strain's GP decided his condition was so severe he needed to see a consultant, but he was told the next available appointment was not until 4 October. Mr Strain was found dead on 1 August. Lindsey Strain, his wife and partner of ten years, broke the news to the family that her husband had died, and police attended and reported no suspicious circumstances. An inquest into Mr Strain's death has been opened and adjourned. Today Mr Strain's father Adrian, a retired head teacher and volunteer Samaritan from Leeds, said his son's friends had been shocked to learn that he'd been suffering from depression. He said: 'There was a mask there. He would come across as a very jolly person... [but he] could not shake those feelings off. 'Early intervention is essential when people have mental health problems. Faster access to therapy could save lives.' His mother, Caroline, said: 'For cancer we talk of the need for early detection - prevention being better than cure. 'But for the millions suffering depression, we wait until they can't cope, til they stop showing up for work, put them on tablets and ask them to wait half a year to see a therapist. 'If we treated people with other diseases like this, the country would be rightly outraged and something would be done.'

A trust spokesman said: 'The NHS would never be able to comment on an individual case.' Scroll down for video . Mr Strain, pictured with his wife, Lindsey, put on a 'jolly' mask but was batting depression, his family said . Geoff Heyes, of mental health charity Mind, said: 'Unfortunately we hear from many people who face lengthy waiting times for psychological therapies, and the tragic case of Martin Strain shows how important early intervention is. 'Talking therapies can be really helpful for people with mental health problems, but it's really important that patients are referred quickly, ideally within 28 days. 'In certain parts of the country this is not happening.'

"The US Air Force has told a sergeant he will have to leave the military unless he agrees to take an oath with the phrase 'so help me God,' officials said Tuesday. In the latest religious controversy to roil the air force, the atheist airman last month was denied his request to re-enlist because of his refusal to swear to God -- and he is now poised to take the military to court, his lawyer said. 'We have not received word from the Air Force regarding our letter. It has not indicated a willingness to settle out of court,' said Monica Miller, an attorney for the American Humanist Association, which has taken up the service member's case. The US Air Force has told a sergeant he will have to leave the military unless he agrees to take an oath with the phrase 'so help me God,' officials said Tuesday. The airman is based at Creech Air Force base in Nevada . With the deadline for re-enlisting expiring in November, the technical sergeant at Creech Air Force base in Nevada - whose name has not been released - will be forced to sue the government in a federal court, Miller told AFP. In the past, an airman could opt for an alternative phrase and omit the words 'so help me God,' but the US Air Force changed its policy in October 2013. The other branches of the American military do not require the reference to God and make the phrase optional. The other branches of the American military do not require the reference to God and make the phrase optional . 'This is the only branch to my knowledge that's actually requiring everyone in all instances to use the religious language,' Miller said. The requirement violates the US Constitution, which bars religious tests to hold office or other positions, Miller said of the case, which was first reported by the Air Force Times. 'The government cannot compel a nonbeliever to take an oath that affirms the existence of a supreme being,' she said. The sergeant's service expires in November and he has until then to re-enlist and take the oath, said US Air Force spokeswoman Ann Stefanek. In the meantime, 'a written legal opinion is being requested' from the Pentagon's top lawyer, she said. The air force has been plagued by controversy for years over religion and the role of Christian evangelists. The US Air Force Academy in Colorado faced accusations several years ago that evangelical Christians exerted a dominating influence over the institution. But attempts to counter the perceived bias in the service have sparked criticism from Christian activist groups, who allege a new rule stifles the religious expression of troops. The disputed rule bars commanders from promoting their religious convictions to their subordinates. Advocates of the policy say it protects troops who worry their careers could be jeopardized if they do not take part in their superior's Christian activities.","Airman denied his request to re-enlist because of his refusal to swear to God .

"With their glossy locks, unlined skin and youthful good looks, the X-Factor panel putting the contestants through their paces on this year's show look better than ever. But according to one top surgeon, Simon Cowell, Cheryl Fernandez-Versini, Mel B and Louis Walsh may owe their good looks to more than just good genes and expensive skincare. Although Cowell's penchant for Botox is . an open secret as is Walsh's hair transplant, Anne-Marie Gillett, the non-surgical director at Transform . Cosmetic Surgery, claims that all four have had more than they admit to. Scroll down for video . Looking good: This year's X-Factor panel are looking better than ever but may have had a few nips and tucks . 'It appears that Mel, 39, has gone through . quite a transformation over the years,' says Gillett. 'Looking at the most recent . picture, her skin appears very taut, tight and mannequin-like. 'These . are all classic tell tale signs of recent and long term use of . injectable treatments.' Like Mel B, Fernandez-Versini, 31, who has previously denied having Botox, may also have had cosmetic injections and, according to Miss Gillett, has also had some dental work done. 'Her forehead is . line free, and her eyebrows are slightly more arched in the recent . picture, both of which indicate that she is possibly having injectable . treatments,' explains Miss Gillett. Video courtesy of Transform Cosmetic Surgery Group . Fresh-faced: At 39, Mel B looks just as good as she did at 20 - thanks in part to a series of cosmetic jabs . 'What . strikes me most are Cheryl’s teeth. It seems that she has had veneers . and her teeth are far more aligned and brighter now than in older pictures.' Although it's widely reported that Cheryl wore Invisalign braces in the past, her current look is possibly the result of extra work, something that the Transform Cosmetic Surgery director describes as a good investment. '[Her teeth] . have most certainly been her best investment and have significantly . altered her overall look.' But adds Miss Gillett, Fernandez-Versini's good looks aren't entirely the work of surgeons. 'Cheryl . has always had great skin,' she explains. 'Fantastic care and, possibly, minimal use of . injectables has resulted in a polished and refined look. Cheryl looks . her age and fantastic for it.' Cowell, 54, is also singled out for his enduringly good skin. 'Simon Cowell looks great for his age and what a head of hair he has,' says Miss Gillett. Pretty in her 30s: Cheryl Fernandez-Versini looks her age and fantastic for it says surgeon Anne-Marie Gillett . Poised: Along with better teeth, Cheryl has become more polished and sophisticated over the years . 'Looking at these pictures, it seems that he’s also been indulging in some non-surgical treatments of late. Simon works in a very image based industry - non-surgical treatments are standard for anyone who works in TV and has their picture taken regularly. 'You’d expect anyone with this type of work to have a good skincare regime and although it’s worked for Simon, we would always advise people not to overdo it – in particular when it’s injectables.' Surprisingly though, it's the seemingly low-maintenance Louis Walsh, 62, who appears to have had the most invasive treatments, with Miss Gillett arguing that his fresh-faced looks are the result of an eye lift. Walsh, who in 2011 admitted to having a £30,000 hair transplant, has previously declared himself 'open' to the idea of having surgery and has said Cowell has encouraged him to have his eye bags sorted out. No change: Simon Cowell looks great for his age and hasn't changed much since this 2002 photo (right) Improvements: Walsh has had a hair transplant and possibly eye bag lift so looks great for his age . According to Miss Gillett, the Irish judge now appears to have taken Cowell's advice. 'The more recent pictures also seem to show signs of him having had a blepharoplasty (an eye lift), which is a surgical procedure to remove and tighten the loose skin from the eye area. 'Popular with men of his age, it results in a more youthful and fresher appearance. I would expect him to indulge in non-surgical treatments such as Botox too, as his forehead is looking smooth and line free.' Walsh, although happy to admit to his hair transplant, has always denied having Botox, saying he would 'never stick poison in his face' and instead putting his youthful looks down to good genes - something that Miss Gillett agrees with. 'He looks great for his age,' she added. 'His overall look is more polished and brighter, which translates well on camera, giving him a much fresher appearance.","According to a top surgeon, all four X-Factor judges have had work done .
Simon Cowell's liking for Botox is well known and he has also had fillers .

"The attorney for 12-year-old Anissa Weier says she is unfit to stand trial, per a psychological exam. She and friend Morgan Geyser, also 12, are accused of attempting to stab to death a classmate . A psychologist has determined the second of two 12-year-old girls charged with stabbing a classmate 19 times in an attempt to please a fictional character called Slender Man has mental health problems that make her unfit to stand trial, her attorney contends. Morgan Geyser was ordered to receive treatment in August after Judge Michael Bohren decided she wouldn't be able to help with her defense if her case went to trial. Now Anissa Weier is scheduled for a two-day probable cause hearing next week. Bohren will decide after that whether she should stand trial on charges of attempted first-degree intentional homicide. Her attorney, Assistant State Public Defender Joseph Smith Jr., told Bohren in a letter filed in court Tuesday that after hearing from a forensic psychologist he hired to examine the girl, he had reason to doubt his client's competency. 'In his professional opinion she is not presently competent to proceed' with a trial, Smith said. He added that he would give Bohren a written copy of the psychologist's report before a hearing on his request to have the girl's case moved to juvenile court. Wisconsin law requires anyone accused of certain serious crimes to be charged as adults if they are 10 or older. According to a criminal complaint, the girls plotted for months before they lured their former friend into the woods after a sleepover in May and attacked her. Scroll down for video . Intent to kill: Weier and Geysor's victim survived the attack, and has since returned to school. She has never been named. Pictured above the morning of the attack . They told investigators they hoped it would please Slender Man, a character they had read about in online horror stories. Smith's client told investigators that she told the victim to lie down and be quiet after the stabbing so that she wouldn't lose blood as quickly, but that she really wanted the victim to be silent so she would die without drawing attention to them. The victim, who also was 12, survived and returned to school last week to start seventh grade. Consequences: If they are tried as adults, and convicted, Weier (left) and Geyser (right) could face up to 65 years in prison. But if tried in juvenile court, they would not be held past age 25 . A court-appointed psychologist testified in August that the other girl, who told police she stabbed the victim more than a dozen times, heard voices and believed she could communicate with Slender Man and other fictional characters. There has been no testimony yet in the case about Smith's client's mental health. Smith told Bohren he wanted to go ahead with the probable cause hearing and have the judge consider his client's mental state during a reverse waiver hearing that would follow. The reverse waiver hearing is where Bohren will decide whether the girl's case belongs in the adult or juvenile systems. Smith has said repeatedly that he hopes to have the case moved to juvenile court. In his letter to Bohren, he expressed concern that if the girl was found unfit to stand trial before the reverse waiver hearing, she would be treated in the adult system and might not receive services appropriate for her age. 'In addition, I have always maintained and continue to maintain that the issue of (her) competency is one of the many factors the court should consider in assessing whether to keep (her) in adult court or transfer her to juvenile court,' Smith wrote. If convicted as adults, each could be locked up for up to 65 years. In the juvenile system, they could not be held past age 25.","Anissa Weier and Morgan Geyser were arrested after attempting to stab a fellow 12-year-old student to death last May 31 .

"Two British researchers detained in Qatar while looking into the poor treatment of migrant workers as the Gulf state prepares to host the 2022 World Cup have been released. Researcher Krishna Upadhyaya, 52, and photographer Ghimire Gundev, 36, from London, went missing in the Qatari capital of Doha on August 31 as they were preparing to leave the country. Qatari authorities confirmed on Saturday that the pair were arrested for unspecified violations of Qatari law. Krishna Upadhyaya (left) and Ghimire Gundev (right) have been released after they were detained in Qatar while looking into the poor treatment of migrant workers as the Gulf state prepares to host the 2022 World Cup . The men's employer, the Global Network for Rights and Development (GNRD), yesterday said the men had been set free but had not yet left Qatar. The group said it does not have details on the reason for their detention. The group said it spoke to Upadhyaya on Monday night and that both men were doing well. It said: 'The news is a fantastic relief for the families ... and all those who have been following the case.' The Global Network for Rights and Development, which is based in Stavanger, Norway, describes itself on its website as a neutral organization set up in 2008 to promote human rights and development. It has been critical of Qatar's treatment of migrant workers in the past. Qatar, like other Gulf Arab states, relies on vast numbers of mainly Asian low-paid migrant workers. Labor rights activists have raised concerns about dangerous working conditions, allegations of unpaid salaries and other abuses since Qatar won the right to host the 2022 World Cup. The researcher and the photographer went missing in the Qatari capital of Doha (pictured) on August 31 as they were preparing to leave the country . Qatar has said the men were arrested for 'having violated the provisions of the laws of the state of Qatar.' Officials in Doha had no immediate comment on the men's release. Upadhyaya and Gundev had been due to fly from Doha to London on Sunday but failed to arrive at the airport. The GNRD said the pair had 'feared they might be in danger' after being harassed by police and had decided to leave the country when they disappeared. They had reportedly been looking in to reports of poor treatment of Nepalese migrant workers as Qatar prepares to stage the football World Cup in 2022.","Two researchers had been looking into poor treatment of migrant workers .

"A girlfriend made her partner of six years wear a T-shirt covered in pictures of the two of them together. Abbie Bartlett, 20, had the shirt custom-made for her boyfriend Leon Connolly, 24. It bears the uncompromising message: 'I love my girlfriend Abbie, I hate the girls in Ibiza, so please stay away from me'. Scroll down for video . Back off: Leon Connolly, 24, was given this t-shirt to wear on a holiday to Ibiza with friends . Miss Bartlett told how she produced the shirt as a surprise as he was packing his bags to leave. Pictures of Mr Connolly wearing the T-shirt were then posted online and received large amounts of attention - leading Miss Bartlett to worry it could have the opposite effect and attract girls who 'like a challenge'. But the couple, who have a five-year-old daughter and live together in Newcastle, have laughed off the publicity and are treating the incident as a joke. Miss Bartlett said: 'When I took it in to the printing shop and explained what I wanted I swear they must have thought I was a psycho.

"Shaun Wright has been thrown off a Home Office taskforce to tackle sexual violence against children and vulnerable people . Embattled crime supremo Shaun Wright has been thrown off a Home Office taskforce to tackle sexual violence against children and vulnerable people, it emerged last night. The man at the centre of the Rotherham sex abuse scandal will no longer represent the Association of Police and Crime Commissioners on the panel. Mr Wright, South Yorkshire Police and Crime Commissioner, has also been blocked from sitting on any other crime-fighting bodies on behalf of the association. The revelation that Mr Wright was still on the taskforce was embarrassing for the Government after a damning report into the horrifying scale of child rape in the town. It revealed that at least 1,400 girls were abused for years by gangs of sexual predators, mainly of Pakistani origin. Before being elected South Yorkshire PCC in 2012, Mr Wright was Rotherham’s councillor in charge of children’s services for five years. The department repeatedly turned a blind eye to evidence that girls had fallen into the clutches of paedophiles from 1997 to last year. But despite the outrage, Mr Wright has refused to resign from his £85,000-a-year post. Current rules do not allow for his removal. In the face of mounting anger, the APCC yesterday announced the shamed commissioner would no longer represent it on eight newly-created standing groups on crime to be introduced on September 25. This means he will be ordered to relinquish his spot on the Home Office panel. In a statement, national PCC chairman Nick Alston said: ‘The APCC will strive to ensure that victims of crime and all members of the public have confidence in the work of PCCs across the country to support the vulnerable and keep communities safe.’","Shaun Wright has also been blocked from sitting on any other crime-fighting bodies as part of the Association of Police and Crime Commissioners .

"A Missouri inmate was put to death in the early hours of this morning for  killing  two people during a restaurant robbery in 1998, the eighth execution in the state this year . Earl Ringo Jr, 40, was executed at 12:22am by lethal injection after a plea to halt the process - based on irregularities in the use of lethal injection drugs in the state - was refused. Ringo's last words came from the Quran and expressed belief and wishes for after death. He wiggled his feet as the process began, breathed deeply a few times, then closed his eyes, all in a matter of seconds. Earl Ringo Jr., 40, wiggled his feet as the execution began, breathed deeply a few times, then closed his eyes, all in a matter of seconds. He had declined to request a last meal, eating instead the Salisbury steak and macaroni and cheese offered to other inmates. In the early hours of July 4, 1998, Ringo and an accomplice killed delivery driver Dennis Poyser and manager trainee JoAnna Baysinger at a Ruby Tuesday restaurant in Columbia. Both victims were shot dead at point-blank range. The run-up to Ringo's execution was shrouded by controversy, as Missouri continues to use the  sedative, midazolam, despite claims that the pre-execution drug is inhumane. Midazolam came under scrutiny  after it was used three in botched executions earlier this year in Ohio, Oklahoma and Arizona. In April, gruesome scenes accompanied the execution of Clayton Lockett, a  murderer and rapist who shot his 19-year-old victim and ordered a friend to bury her alive. It was a full 43 minutes after the drug was administered in the Oklahoma execution chamber  that the convicted killer died. During this time, Lockett thrashed violently, lurching forward against his restraints, writhing and attempting to speak. Willie Trottie, who turned 45 Monday, shot and killed 24-year-old Barbara Canada, and her  brother, Titus. His execution is also scheduled for today. Witnesses described his body twisting, and his head reaching up from the gurney, before the curtains were drawn around the chamber obscuring Lockett's final minutes from public view. In January, convicted murderer and rapist Dennis McGuire appeared to gurgle, gasp for air and convulse for around 10 minutes after being sentenced to death using an experimental two-drug concoction including midazolam. Chilling scenes also occurred in the Arizona execution chamber in July, when Joseph Rudolph Wood took nearly two hours to die from the lethal injection. Witnesses told how the murderer appeared to be struggling to breathe after the sedation and then gasped desperately for breath at least 600 times before falling still. Ringo's attorneys had argued that the drug could dull his senses and leave him unable to express any pain or suffering during the process. They had asked a federal appeals court to postpone the execution until a hearing over Missouri's use of midazolam. Attorney Richard Sindel claimed that Missouri's use of midazolam essentially violates its own protocol, which provides for pentobarbital as the lone execution drug. But the courts and Gov. Jay Nixon had refused to halt Ringo's execution over the concerns. The Missouri Department of Corrections says it administers midazolam before executions and not as part of its execution protocol. 'It should not be lost in the national debate over the death penalty that Earl Ringo Jr. was responsible for the murders of two innocent Missourians. For 16 years he avoided payment for this crime. Tonight he has paid the penalty,' Missouri's Attorney General, Chris Koster, said in a statement. A clemency petition to Nixon had also cited concerns about the fact that Ringo was convicted and sentenced to death by an all-white jury. Ringo was sentenced to death by lethal injection (file picture).  His execution is the eighth in Missouri this year . Chilling scenes accompanied the executions of Joseph Rudolph Wood, left, Dennis McGuire, centre and Clayton Lockett, right, who were all administered the pre-execution sedative midazolam . On July 3, 1998, Ringo told his accomplice Quentin Jones about his plan to rob the Ruby Tuesday restaurant in Columbia, where he once worked. Jones agreed to join him. Before sunrise on July 4, Ringo and Jones hid behind a grease pit in the back of the restaurant. Poyser and Baysinger arrived and entered the restaurant. Ringo followed them and shot Poyser, 45, killing him instantly. He then ordered Baysinger, 22, to open a safe. She pulled out $1,400 and gave it to him. Ringo gave the gun to Jones, who stood with the weapon pointed at Baysinger's head for a minute and a half before pulling the trigger. Interviews with restaurant workers and former workers led police to Ringo. Detectives found a blue ski mask, gun receipt, bulletproof vest and other evidence at the home of his mother. Happ - who raped and killed Angie Crowley, 21, in 1986 - died by lethal injection in 2013 . William Happ, 51, was the first death row inmate to be injected with midazolam hydrochloride. The execution began at 6.02pm at Florida State Prison. Happ's eyes opened and he blinked several times. He closed  and opened them again two minutes later. He then yawned and his jaw dropped open. At 6.08pm, the official overseeing the execution tugged at Happ's eyelids and grasped his shoulder to check for a response. There was none. A minute later, Happ's head began moving back and forth and shortly thereafter his breathing stopped. He was pronounced dead at 6.16pm. Ringo admitted to the robbery but claimed the shootings were in self-defense. He was convicted in 1999 and sentenced to death. Jones, of Louisville, Kentucky, pleaded guilty to first-degree murder and was sentenced to life in prison, but he was spared the death penalty when he agreed to testify against Ringo. Jama Brown, who was married for to Poyser for 24 years, asked that people remember the victims. 'I can only tell you there is not a day that goes by that I don't think of him or wonder what my life would be like today, not only for myself, but for my kids,' she said. In a statement she added: 'Please do not make this about how executions shouldn't take place. Put your effort on how we can stop people from committing these terrible actions. 'Please remember these two wonderful people who just wanted to go to work on the Fourth of July to support their families.' Ringo's execution is the eighth in the state this year and the tenth since November. St. Louis Public Radio reported last week that Missouri administered midazolam to all nine inmates put to death since November. Corrections department spokesman David Owen said midazolam 'is used to relieve the offender's level of anxiety' and is not part of the actual execution process. The execution was one of two scheduled for today in the U.S. This afternoon Texas plans to execute Willie Trottie  for killing his common-law wife and her brother in 1993. Trottie's execution will be Texas' eighth this year. Florida has performed seven executions in 2014, and all other states have a combined six. Both Missouri and Texas use pentobarbital as their execution drug but decline to disclose where the drug is obtained. 'They don't tell you what it is and where it comes from,' Trottie told The Associated Press. 'What I've learned in 20 years here on death row is all you can do is say, 'OK.' 'I'm ready whichever way it goes. If God says, 'Yes,' I'm ready.' Trottie, who turned 45 Monday, shot and killed 24-year-old Barbara Canada, and her 28-year-old brother, Titus, at the Canada family home in Houston. Canada's mother and sister were also wounded. Lawyers for Trottie argued in their appeal that the one-time deliveryman and security guard suffered poor representation in his initial trial. They said his counsel failed to present witnesses who would have told jurors Trottie and Barbara Canada were romantically engaged at the time of the killings. Late Monday, the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals rejected the appeal. Trottie said he and Barbara Canada were on 'good terms' despite an on-again, off-again relationship. Trottie said he was defending himself against Titus Canada, who shot first. He said the shooting of his wife was accidental. 'It wasn't like I just walked in there and gunned her down,' he said. Johnny Sutton, the lead prosecutor at Trottie's trial, said evidence showed that's exactly what happened. 'He hunted them down,' Sutton said. 'The self-defense claim is absolutely ridiculous. He kicked in their door. ... They already were worried about him. He was making threats and trying to run her off the road. 'This one was so cold and calculated.'","Earl Ringo Jr executed by lethal injection in the early hours of this morning .

"Friends of the Earth is at the centre of a row over BBC claims it has dropped its long-standing opposition to nuclear power. File picture . Campaigning Green group Friends of the Earth is at the centre of a row over BBC claims it has dropped its long-standing opposition to nuclear power. Just two years ago the organisation was warning nuclear energy was ‘a gamble we don’t need to take’. It said there was good evidence to believe the country could reduce greenhouse gas emissions by closing coal and gas fired power stations without the need to fill the resulting energy gap with nuclear. The group also complained nuclear was too expensive and created radioactive waste that would be a danger for thousands of years. However, the BBC reported yesterday that the group had dropped its opposition to nuclear power in a major shift in policy. It said the group’s director of policy, Craig Bennett, believed the time it takes to build new nuclear power stations was the biggest worry, rather than safety. Mr Bennett told the Radio 4 Today programme: ‘The biggest risk of nuclear is it takes far too long to build.’ He suggested the whole process of getting approval for new nuclear power plants was so expensive and long-winded that it was better to opt for other low carbon options, such as wind, solar and wave power. The comments triggered an immediate row with both Mr Bennett and the FoE leadership accusing the BBC of misrepresenting the organisation’s views. The group’s executive director, Andy Atkins, released a statement saying the group had made no changes to its stance on nuclear. He said: ‘Friends of the Earth has not changed its position on nuclear power. We remain firmly opposed to it and continue to strongly promote a transition to an energy system based on energy efficiency and our abundant resource of renewable energy, which is getting cheaper to exploit by the day. ‘We have always been an evidence-based organisation and we commission independent reports to ensure our policy positions are robust, and we will continue to do so in the future.' The group’s executive director, Andy Atkins, released a statement saying the group had made no changes to its stance on nuclear. Pictured, Sizewell B nuclear power station in Suffolk, England . Mr Bennett said the BBC’s report had been misleading and he asked for a correction. He said: ‘Of course there are real concerns about radiation particularly around nuclear waste and it’s right we are concerned about that. 'But it’s important the debate has shifted down the years. The real concern now is how we get on fast with decarbonising our electricity supply, if you look at the models, it shows nuclear cannot be delivered fast.’ The BBC Environment Specialist, Roger Harribin, who was behind the report, defended his piece on Twitter saying: ‘Does FoE want existing nukes closed? 'No. Is its main objection now cost not safety? Yes. You’re not pro-nuke but this is shift.’","Broadcaster and green group argue over 'misrepresentation'
BBC reportedly said FoE's objection to nuclear based on time to implement ."
"Tens of thousands of public sector jobs in Scotland are at risk if voters choose independence next week, pro-Union campaigners warned yesterday. More than 57,000 Scots are employed by Westminster departments or UK-wide public bodies such as the BBC. Splitting from the rest of Britain would put many civil service positions in jeopardy as the smaller Scottish state would not need all of them, No vote supporters say. Scroll down for video . The pro-Union Better Together campaign have said an independent Scotland would have to cut public spending by £6billion, putting thousands of jobs at risks . There are also question marks over whether an independent Scotland would be able to afford to maintain its large public sector if oil revenues fall. A total of 545,200 Scottish workers are employed by the state, making up more than 21 per cent of the total labour market. By contrast less than 17 per cent of jobs in England are in the public sector, official figures from the start of this year show. A recent report by the Institute for Government think-tank noted that some of the largest Westminster departments are ‘over-represented’ in Scotland. Scotland makes up about 8 per cent of the UK’s population, but has 11 per cent of jobs in the Department for Work and Pensions and 12 per cent in HM Revenue and Customs. Some 57,800 Scots work for Whitehall ministries or quangos and other public bodies that cover the whole of Britain. Westminster’s biggest employer in Scotland is the Ministry of Defence, which has 3,900 civil servants and 10,600 uniformed personnel north of the border. Former defence secretary Philip Hammond warned last year that these jobs and defence contracts worth billions of pounds would be put in peril if Scottish voters opted for independence. The Department for Work and Pensions employs a further 10,700 Scots, while 9,000 work for HM Revenue and Customs. Another 600 jobs are based at the offices of the Department for International Development (Dfid) in East Kilbride, representing a third of the ministry’s total workforce. The BBC has about 1,200 employees in Scotland, but it is unclear precisely what would happen to them in the event of independence. SNP leader Alex Salmond wants to create a new public service broadcaster called the Scottish Broadcasting Service, which would ‘initially be founded on the staff and assets of BBC Scotland’. Alex Salmond has been accused of making pledges he can not afford to fund - such as new public service broadcaster called the Scottish Broadcasting Service . Scottish institutions account for the bulk of public sector workers in the country. These jobs would not be affected immediately by a vote in favour of independence. Some 248,000 Scots work in local government, including schools, and 158,000 are employed by NHS Scotland. The Scottish Government and its agencies have 16,900 staff, while 28,700 people work for the Scottish police or fire services. Labour MP Michael McCann fears that hundreds of Dfid jobs in his East Kilbride constituency would be axed if the Yes campaign prevails next week. He rejected SNP claims that all the posts would be maintained in a newly independent Scotland. The Commons International Development Committee, which he sits on, has calculated that nearly all of the Dfid positions for Scots would be lost. Mr McCann said: ‘What we established is that Scotland would have to set up its own international development agency. It would be a fraction of the size of the current operation in East Kilbride. It would mean 500 jobs would go.’ He accused Mr Salmond of making pledges he could not afford to fund and suggested that many Scottish public sector workers would vote to remain in the UK. ‘In a democracy you are entitled to vote against your own self-interest, but I doubt many people would,’ he said. Labour MP for East Kilbride Michael McCann, pictured centre on the campaign trail with Ed Miliband, rejected SNP claims that all the posts would be maintained in a newly independent Scotland . ‘The majority of Scots are far too canny to be brought into this concept that you can get everything available for free. It simply doesn’t add up.’ A spokesman for the pro-Union Better Together campaign added: ‘The impartial experts at the Institute for Fiscal Studies say that a separate Scotland would need to cut public spending by an extra £6 billion. That puts jobs in the public sector at risk. ‘This is a risk that we just don't have to take. There is a better way for Scotland. We are guaranteed more powers for Scotland, backed up by the strength, security and stability of being part of the larger UK. ‘It's the best of both worlds. We should say “No Thanks” to putting that at risk on September 18.’ The Scottish Government’s White Paper on independence, launched last November, states that ‘many’ current Westminster jobs will transfer to the new separate Scotland in the event of a Yes vote. It adds: ‘Independence will provide opportunities for employment in Scotland in government functions where jobs are currently located elsewhere in the UK. ‘Given that the Scottish Government will be taking on a range of new responsibilities, there will be new job opportunities in the public sector in Scotland.’ The Yes campaign declined to comment.","More than 57,000 Scots are employed by Westminster departments .

"Rappers and police are famed for never seeing eye to eye. So when police in the Midlands interrupted a rapper and his crew while filming a music video, things got pretty heated.

The cameras that were capturing the music video continue to roll as moments later a disagreement begins. And KY decides the time is right to flex his creative juices and deliver a freestyle rap which will belittle the long arm of the law.

"A car thief and his stripper-girlfriend-accomplice  attempted to escape handcuffs in the back of a cop car by passing an earring during a kiss. Jonathan Kokontis, 25, and his girlfriend Melissa Elaine Schneider, 27, were arrested on Saturday after trying to steal cars in Seminole County, Florida. After 911 calls from the Fern Park neighborhood reported a man and a woman, in pink shorts, stealing cars, officers apprehended the suspects. Melissa Schneider and Jonathan Kokonitis were arrested for trying to steal cars in a Florida neighborhood on Saturday . Kokonitis at first fled, leaving his girlfriend behind but was later found in a shed. Former convict Kokontis was booked on charges including burglary, escape and robbery. He is being held at Seminole County Jail, according to the Orlando Sentinel. Schneider, a performer at Dancers Royale strip club in Orlando, was held on her own long list of charges including providing contraband to a felon. Schneider pictured in a 2011 mugshot while serving time for grand theft auto . According to the Sentinel, during their arrest, Schneider allegedly rubbed her head against her boyfriend's chest, pulling out an earring in the process which landed on his lap. He then tried to unlock his handcuffs with the earring. When that failed, Schneider allegedly then reached inside her bra and passed an unindentified object to her boyfriend via a kiss. Police did not identify what that object was. The arresting officer saw the pair working to try to free themselves, so removed the 25-year-old from the car to recuff him. He then took off running to which his girlfriend shouted after him: '******* run!' He was arrested trying to steal another car and was brought down using a police dog which bit his arm. He was hospitalized and then taken to jail. Schneider was initially released but then arrested again the next day for beating a pregnant woman who had asked her for a cigarette and being found in possession of marijuana. The couple both have multiple prior convictions including grand theft auto.","Jonathan Kokontis, 25, and his girlfriend Melissa Elaine Schneider, 27, were arrested on Saturday for trying to steal cars .

"Some 75,000 youngsters took part in the Assisted Places Scheme, which ran for 17 years from 1980 before it was abolished by Tony Blair . Parents want a return of taxpayer-funded schemes to pay for bright children from poorer backgrounds to go to independent schools, a report says. Some 75,000 youngsters took part in the Assisted Places Scheme, which ran for 17 years from 1980 before it was abolished by Tony Blair. A report today on education and social mobility by the Sutton Trust campaign group says more parents now support rather than oppose schemes for the state to pay for able children to go to high-quality private schools. An opinion poll by the Trust found 41 per cent thought all children should have the chance to go to private school at taxpayers’ expense. Only 29 per cent were against, with the rest undecided. The Assisted Places Scheme began during Margaret Thatcher’s first term in power and was open to bright pupils from low and middle-income homes in England and Wales whose parents could not afford full, independent school fees. The Government paid a proportion of the fees, depending on household income. A previous ‘direct grant’ scheme had been wound up in the 1970s, at the same time as the closure of most grammar schools. Critics say this led to a decline in social mobility. The polling, carried out by YouGov among 1,169 parents of school-aged children, also suggested that parents were swinging behind the idea of using ballots for places at over-subscribed state schools. The system in which pupils are selected depending on how close they live to a school has led to claims it benefits affluent families who can afford to live in costly catchment areas. The report also suggests working-class parents should be given means-tested vouchers that could be spent on extra tuition, books or cultural activities for their children. Dr Lee Elliot Major, Sutton Trust policy director, said: ‘There is a clear recognition in all the main political parties that we need to do a lot more to improve social mobility. Fairer admissions and fairer access must be at the heart of any programme to improve social mobility. Our poll shows a public appetite for change in oversubscribed comprehensives and academies. We need changes, too, to ensure fair access to grammar schools, independent schools and elite universities.’","Some 75,000 youngsters took part in the Assisted Places Scheme .

"These stunning images show  shamans from around the world performing a number of dramatic rituals in a remote part of the Siberian mountains. Spiritual leaders from different corners of the globe gathered for the 'Call of 13 Shamans', a four-day festival held near the village of Khorum-Dag in the Tyva Republic. It is the centre point of the Asian continent and an area that is said to have high spiritual 'charge'. The timing of the event had been chosen to match natural cosmic cycles. The group of shamans, who travelled from countries including Mexico, Mongolia, Greenland, Russia and Korea, began by trekking to isolated locations for three days of meditation before performing a number of ceremonies - many of which originated in prehistory. Scroll down for video . A shaman performs a ritual next to a fire in a remote part of the Siberian mountains.  It's part of the festival 'Call of 13 Shamans' held near the village of Khorum-Dag in Tyva Republic, the geographic centre of the Asian continent . Some of the rituals and appearances are similar to those of Native Americans. DNA evidence suggests that the indigenous American population originated from the Siberian mountains, before leaving Russia and passing over the frozen Bering Strait around 14,000 years ago . They then slaughtered animals as a sacrifice before throat-singing, dancing and playing drums in different areas of the mountainous region. Photographer Alexander Nikolsky, who captured the incredible event, told The Siberian Times: 'We came to the site the day before all the shamans arrived. The locals were not very happy about this, because Khorum-Dag mountain is a sacred place and people should not disturb the spirits. As if to confirm their words, a great storm erupted on the first night. Shaman Irina Daryina from Belarus said: 'Tyva is a special land, with very powerful mountains and many ancient burial mounds'. According to the festival's website: 'Under the auspices of Father Sky and Mother Earth, the strongest shamans from Russia, CIS (Commonwealth of Independent States) and abroad, their followers and all the participants of the festival will make shamanic mysteries and create joint good wishes to open a White Road to the world of harmony for all the earth. They also aim to: 'Subside feud and conflicts between nations and peoples, to do everything possible for the disappearance of the world’s orphanhood and poverty and so that our future would be bright and calm.' Their practices and appearances are similar to Native Americans, who are believed to have originated from Siberia. A study of the mutations indicated a lineage shift between 13,000 and 14,000 years ago - when people are thought to have walked across the frozen Bering Strait from Russia to America. This roughly coincides with the period when humans from Siberia are thought to have crossed what is now the Bering strait and entered America. Among the people who may have emerged from the Altai region are the predecessors of the first Native Americans. The practitioners often enter a trance-like state during the rituals while performing divination or healing. Many of the ceremonies originated in prehistory . The shamans began the sacred festival by going to different locations in the mountains for three days of meditation and spiritual ceremonies . The shamans bang drums together as they walk around a campfire in southeastern Siberia.

Life is all' In one of the more intimate rituals, one of the shamans places his hand around his counterpart and raises a bowl to his mouth . He then  rests his head on his left hand and closes his eyes while the pair continue embracing .

The couple had stopped at the fast found restaurant Monday on their way to the police station, as Turner was concerned about the children and felt Hoggle was 'not forthcoming' when he suggested the two go pick them up at daycare. Moments later, Hoggle went out the back door and walked to the Germantown Transit Center. 'I want it over with, I want my children here with me,' said Turner, who has been distributing and posting  flyers all over town in hopes of finding his wife and children. Montgomery County police have obtained a warrant for  Hoggle's arrest, charging her with child neglect, a misdemeanor with a maximum penalty of 5 years and $5,000, according to ABC 7.

"A Mississippi man captured his city's attention and terrified pet owners when he posted a sign in his front yard threatening to slay any stray cat he found. 'If you have a cat, keep it in your yard or I will kill it,' the sign promised. The man, who would identify himself to reporters only as Kevin, says the sign drew so much attention he's in trouble with the Hernando mayor's office. 'If you have a cat, keep it in your yard or I will kill it,' promises this Mississippi yard sign . 'Next time, I'll put something a little nice,' he told WMC. Kevin painted the sign enraged after a cat that regularly passed through his yard woke him up at 5 a.m. yet again by causing his dog to bark and scratch at the blinds. On that day, he said he hadn't had his coffee yet and had 'had it.' But now he's getting death threats from cat owners. And the mayor's office immediately dispatched an animal control officer to deal with the situation and make sure that any wandering cats would only be corralled not killed. Kevin told reporters he would never actually murder a feline and that the sign was painted in the heat of the moment without thinking. But his neighbors remain unsettled, especially Hannah Ward who owns the cat that offended him to begin with. 'For a sign like that, I don't know. It's a little much,"" she said. 'If something happened to my cat, I don't know . what I would do.' The sign's painter, Kevin, said he made it in a fit of rage after neighbor Hannah Ward's roaming cat repeatedly woke him up at 5 a.m. by wandering into his yard and causing his dogs to bark . She said her cat, T.J., was a rescue cat with a sweet personality and a penchant for wandering. The Ward's have not seen the cat since Wednesday. Kevin said their concern just proves his sign worked. 'It took about 20 minutes and I knew who it was,' he said. Animal control has since asked him to remove the sign. 'It's illegal. It's animal cruelty, and we are watching him and keeping an eye on the general area,' said Hernando Animal Control official Jacob Hisaw. While Hisaw may not agree with sign's message, there is no proof Kevin broke any laws.","Man, who would only identify himself as Kevin, said he would not actually hurt an animal and made the sign in a fit of rage after being repeatedly woken at 5 a.m. by wandering cats .

"Crime Stoppers have released images of Australia's most wanted men as part of their 2014 Operation Roam. The not-for-profit organization has compiled a list of 18 of the most dangerous fugitives in the country, with rewards of up to $1 million for people who aid in their capture. The nationwide police crackdown has proved immensely successful, with 3 of the men listed as wanted in the 2013 list arrested within 48 hours of Operation Roam's launch. All nine men were eventually arrested, with authorities emboldened to continue the initiative this year. A list compiled by Crime Stoppers of the 18 most wanted men in Australia was released yesterday . 'The smallest piece of information, no matter how insignificant it may seem, can be the missing piece of a puzzle to solving a crime or locating a wanted person,' said Deputy Chairman of Crime Stoppers, Peter Price. Since the launch of this year's list, one fugitive has already been arrested. Crime Stoppers are urging people to visit their website to see if they recognise any of the men on the list. If members of the public have any information regarding the criminals, they are asked to report it immediately. Five of Australia's most wanted men: the dangerous fugitives named by Operation Roam . 'Operation Roam aims to tap into the wealth of information in our community to locate some of the country’s most wanted people,' NSW Police Assistant Commissioner Peter Barrie said. The 18 men are wanted on crimes including  sexual assault, attempted murder, drug trafficking and robbery. One such fugitive is South Australian man Stuart Pearce, who is wanted for questioning regarding the murder of his wife and three children in 1991. The chief executive officer of Crime Stoppers Victoria, Sam Hunter, has warned that the Parafield Gardens man may now be 'anywhere in the country', noting that the mobile nature of modern society enables criminals to move more fluidly through the nation. South Australian man Stuart Pearce is wanted for questioning regarding the murder of his wife and three children in 1991. This graphic show the projected aging of Pierce since the year of his disappearance . 'They may now be living in your neighbourhood,' Ms. Hunter said. 'They could be your neighbour or mechanic and have assumed another identity,' 'They might catch the train in the morning,' Ms. Hunter reiterated the importance of reporting even small amounts of information. 'Any information that could be passed on to Crime Stoppers to help pass that again on to Victoria or South Australian police would be most valuable,' Ms. Hunter said. Often pieces of information thought unimportant prove valuable, and members of the public can remain anonymous when reporting if they so desire. 'We just need to know what you know,' Ms Hunter said. 'Every small piece of information helps police to build up an intelligence picture,' 'Even if people think it may not be worth the call we urge you to give us a call. we'll pass that on to police and they can be the judge of how useful that information may be.' Police recommend that members of the public should not approach any suspected wanted persons, but call Triple Zero immediately.

Some things don't change, do they? Scroll down for video . Brave admission: Bel Mooney can identify with the film Obvious Child, starring Jenny Slate, right, as she once had an abortion . Of course, we all know such behaviour is not to be encouraged - not least because it could end in not just tears, but a baby or an abortion. And that's the subject of a wonderful new film causing controversy in America, which has just opened here. Obvious Child tells the truth about abortion and that's something few women would shout openly and which pro-life groups would rather suppress. For the fact is that for many people who have had one, including myself, an abortion is no big deal. Not that the film treats the topic frivolously. Far from it. The bitter-sweet comedy tells the story of how Donna Stern, an edgy comedian in Brooklyn who has just been dumped by her boyfriend, has a one-night stand - and then finds herself pregnant. At 28, she's better at cracking dubious jokes about flatulence and knickers in her weekly stand-up routine at a comedy club than doing her taxes. Watching her made me wince and cringe, but she is undeniably real. With her parents nudging her to take control of her life, this kooky, unglamorous Jewish girl has a lot of growing up to do. Unsettled, immature, newly jobless and horrified at the thought of having a baby, she sees no choice - she wants an abortion. When the clinic advises her to think carefully about it, she replies with a seriousness we haven't yet seen: 'I have thought about it and this is what I want to do.' Touchingly, Donna discovers that her super-efficient, academic mother is not furious (as she expected). She confesses that when she was a student in the Sixties and abortions were illegal, she, too, went through the procedure. Bitter-sweet comedy: In the controversial film, the main character becomes pregnant after a one night stand and decides to have an abortion . It was the right thing for her to do at that time, she says, and she knows that it is right for her daughter. I realise that my use of the word 'right' will make some people furious. What's more, talking about this film requires using the words 'comedy' and 'abortion' in the same sentence, which is bound to greatly anger those who object to abortion on moral and religious grounds. America's pro-life movement has attacked the film and I'm sure it will be controversial here, too. But I must point out that it does not tell a single joke about abortion. On the contrary, it shows a woman whose repertoire of crass jokiness covers up her inner vulnerability. She wants to be loved, but messes up. I recognise Donna - she is like so many people I've known and others who write to my Saturday advice column. Because of that I certainly don't judge her. When you reach the tender ending of the film, you realise that her decision to have an abortion as early as possible was wise and, yes, right. This is not about a 'lifestyle choice'. It is about realising that the decision to bring a child into this world is the most serious you can make. Which is worse: to bring an unwanted baby into a chaotic life or to terminate the pregnancy at the earliest possible moment? Right to choose: Bel with newborn daughter Kitty in 1980 - months before she had an abortion . Unfortunately, far too many young women make the first choice, and society is paying an appalling price. To me, the 'crime' is being reckless with your fertility and then irresponsibly and stupidly dithering so long about an unwanted pregnancy that an abortion is carried out very late. I would probably support a move to legislate that the abortion limit of 24 weeks (established in 1990) is too high. But I still have no doubt that women have the right to choose an early abortion and that they are usually wise to do so. One of the most interesting things about Obvious Child is that Donna's feelings about abortion are not over-dramatised. I have received letters to my advice column expressing guilt at abortions carried out years earlier - and naturally I sympathise. What else can I do? Yet there is another side: those women who know they have made the right decision and vow to get on with their lives. In a touching and true moment in the film, Donna asks her supportive best friend, who had an abortion years earlier, whether she thinks about it often. She replies without hesitation: 'I think about it sometimes - once in a while - and then I get sad. But I never regret it.' I can honestly say I've never felt sad about having a very early termination at the end of 1980. My son was born in 1974, smaller than average and treated in special care. Then in 1975 I endured 16 hours of labour delivering a stillborn son at full term. In January 1980, I had my daughter prematurely by caesarean section, contracted a dangerous infection and heard a succession of bleak warnings from doctors about my baby's health. The prognosis was uncertain and the future looked frightening and exhausting in equal measure - though at the time I had no way of predicting just how hard it would be. That's why, 11 months after my daughter's birth and pregnant again at the age of 34, I was so relieved to hear my new GP tell me: 'If you were my daughter, I would counsel a termination.' We'd moved house to give the children a better life in the country, I'd mislaid my Pills during the chaos and bingo. Like Donna in the film, I was thoughtful, but determined about having an abortion. And from that day until this, I have never experienced a moment of regret about that decision. For the sake of my health and in order to care for my sick child, it was the right thing to do. The night before the abortion, Donna has a gig at the comedy club. Her chaotic life is the material for her act, but this time she plays it almost straight and tells her audience about the pregnancy and abortion. Bel, pictured with her son in 1979, does not regret having an abortion a year after this picture was taken . You can sense that the women in the audience are relieved to hear such honesty and the men respond to it, too, with warm applause. I found it moving when she concludes her act: 'I think it's gonna be OK and afterwards... I'll be in my future... and, you know, we'll go from there.' It seems to me that such an attitude is healthy. Sometimes I feel frustrated by the modern tendency to rachet up every single emotional upset into a trauma that will require counselling and scar you for ever. Equally irritating is the refusal to admit there are degrees of seriousness, which is why when a judge or commentator suggests that date rape is less horrific than gang rape there is an hysterical outcry of indignation. I believe it diminishes the very real suffering of parents who have nursed a sick child who dies in their arms to treat an early miscarriage or abortion (and I have had both) as a life-changing heartache you will nurse for ever. People suffer terrible things and somehow continue to live with courage and determination. No advice columnist likes thoughtless cliches such as 'Get over it' and 'Move on'. Do you agree with Bel - or think her attitude is callous? We want to hear your views and personal stories. Please email: dm.femail@dailymail.co.ukFact-box text . Yet sometimes we have to accept what happens to us - accept the sadness as well as the change and continue with life. That's what Obvious Child makes you realise: we all make mistakes and have to deal with the consequences, but that doesn't mean there is no possibility of a happy ending. You have to embrace the fact you will be 'in your future' - and cope. Just as I did, and just as many thousands of women have, whether they will admit it or not.

"Emissary: The Queen may be forced to appoint an Australian-style representative to rule in her name in an independent Scotland . The Queen may be forced to appoint an Australian-style representative to rule in her name in an independent Scotland, experts suggested yesterday. The Monarch could be confronted with divided loyalties as head of state for both the remainder of the UK and a breakaway nation north of the border. Though nationalists insist it would not be necessary, a solution could be to appoint a governor-general to act on behalf of the Sovereign. There are also suggestions that Prince Charles may have to receive a second coronation if he is crowned Scotland’s King. Scotland’s First Minister Alex Salmond insisted this week that the Queen would be ‘proud’ to become ‘Queen of Scots’ in the event of a Yes vote, and risked the wrath of the Palace by hinting that she told him as much in a recent visit to Balmoral. Though the Queen is thought to be passionately in favour of the Union, Buckingham Palace took the highly unusual step of warning earlier this week that she should not be dragged into the debate. A spokesman for the Monarch said she was ‘above politics’ and dismissed suggestions that she should publicly intervene in the referendum campaign. The Queen is head of state in 16 countries outside the UK, such as Canada and Australia, and has personal representatives in each. Though significant numbers of Scottish nationalists want a republic, Mr Salmond has insisted the Queen will become head of state of an independent Scotland. Robert Blackburn, professor of constitutional law at King’s College London, said the Queen may need to consider her role if the UK does break apart next week. He said: ‘Politically, the Queen could find herself in difficulties if she received contradictory advice on her Royal duties or public utterances on matters of common interest, particularly in foreign or diplomatic matters, where the British and Scottish governments might happen to be at loggerheads. ‘One solution would be to establish an office of governor-general in Edinburgh to act in the Queen’s name.’ Scroll down for video . Scotland's First Minister Alex Salmond campaigns for a Yes vote in east Edinburgh, Scotland, today . A Scottish governor-general would be likely to act as commander of armed forces and act as the country’s head of state in the day-to-day running of the country, on the advice of the country’s elected leader. A governor-general would also have the power to appoint a Scottish prime minister if an election had resulted in a hung parliament. Scottish church leaders have also examined plans for a separate coronation ceremony, the first to take place on Scottish soil since 1651 when King Charles II took the throne. Majesty: There are also suggestions that Prince Charles may have to receive a second coronation if he is crowned Scotland’s King . Any changes would not apply to the present Queen, but a second coronation could take place for her successors – most likely in St Giles’ Cathedral in Edinburgh. Future Kings and Queens would promise to ‘uphold Scottish religious life and traditions’. The coronation of every British monarch to date has taken place at Westminster Abbey in London, with the Queen’s ceremony taking place 60 years ago this June. They are performed by the Archbishop of Canterbury, the most senior cleric in the Church of England. Stephen Haseler, director of the Global Policy Institute in London, added: ‘Alex Salmond has overcome the issue of the monarchy initially by saying “Look, we will keep the Queen”. ‘But of course the Queen won’t be around for very long, and my absolute conviction is that once the Queen goes the Scots won’t wear Prince Charles, and they will go for a republican system within the European Union.’","Queen Elizabeth may have to appoint a representative if Scotland votes Yes .

"Did Anheuser Busch lift the work of an independent artist to use in its Colorado town-takeover campaign? They did if you ask the clever mind behind a t-shirt of a Vanilla Ice Ice Cream truck. At a seemingly similar real life truck, the 90s pop-rapper personally handed out ice cream this past weekend at Bud Lite's Whatever USA pop-up party town in Crested Butte. Artist Ben Douglass says someone in the Bud Lite marketing campaign swiped his design and hired the 90s star to come help drum up publicity, all without paying him a penny. Similar? Bud lite's version: Here is Vanilla Ice giving out ice cream at the Bud Lite Vanilla Ice Cream truck in Crested Butte, where Anheuser Busch built a pop-up party town over the weekend . Plagiarism? Here is the graphic artist Ben Douglass says he created for a t-shirt company before the weekend's festivities in Crested Butte . Winners and losers? Revelers packed the town of Crested Butte for WhateverUSA, which was a boon for Anheuser Busch, but Douglass believes he's lost out . On Douglass's t-shirt, a rendering of Vanilla Ice holds a cartoon cone beside a truck emblazoned with the words 'Vanilla Ice Ice Cream.' Beside it floats the original white pop-rapper's head. On the 'Vanilla Ice Cream Truck' at this past weekend's Whatever USA party, that same head of Vanilla Ice, or one that looks eerily like it, floats on the side of the vehicle. 'It’s pretty clearly exactly what I drew,' Douglass told Fortune. 'I don’t know if it was by accident or what.' Douglass initially took his frustrations out via social media. 'No problem,' the graphic designer tweeted bitterly. 'Feel free to steal my work. I'm sure times are tight for @AnheuserBusch #whateverusa' He maintained his bitter tone in a September 7 Facebook post that has since gone viral. 'Thank you to Bud Light for liking my work (and idea) so much they decided to steal it,' wrote the New Jersey-based artist. 'Why should a little mom and pop company like Anheuser Busch pay artists for their original property?' Anheuser Busch has since issued a statement on the matter: . 'Anheuser-Busch and Bud Light respect the property and creativity of artists, and we’re looking into the situation' As has Vanilla Ice himself, in his own way. 'Now I see it,' Ice tweeted, presumably in reference to the similarity between t-shirt and truck. 'Looking good.Big pimpin, luv your artwork.' While Douglass may have months or years of legal battles ahead, things aren't looking all bad for the graphic designer. 'On the bright side Vanilla Ice now follows me on twitter,' Douglass said. Bright side: Douglass would later complain that he was angry about Bud Lite's alleged uncredited use of his work, but gush that at least it got Vanilla Ice to follow him on Twitter .","Anheuser Busch had 90s pop-rapper manning a Vanilla Ice Cream Truck at their Whatever USA town takeover in Crested Butte this weekend .

"A former glamour model fears she's destined to be single forever - because no man will ever match up to her cats. Tabitha Miles, 40, from Southend-on-Sea, Essex, is so crazy about her pampered cats that she spends an incredible £4,000 a year tending to them. But men run a mile when Tabby (yes, really!) brings her two pets Wolfie and Foxy out on dates with her. She even insists they share her bed, no matter who else is in it. Model Tabitha Miles fears she's destined to be single forever, due to her intense love of her cats Foxy (pictured) and Wolfie . Model Tabby has never had a proper long-term relationship - and claims it's because she can't find a man who will put up with her obsession. She said: 'I love them so much - I think they might be Britain's most pampered cats. 'When blokes find out that they sleep in the bed with me and that they are with me all the time, they disappear. 'But if a man doesn't love my cats as much as I do, he's got no place in my life. Spoilt cats Wolfie and Foxy live a life of luxury, sleeping only on goose-feather pillows and enjoying regular trips to the salon. Doting Tabby even takes them to restaurants on their birthdays. She can't bear to be apart from the pair, and they even join the ex-Page Three girl at work on photoshoots. Tabby says one guy she went on a date with called it quits when she said the cats sleep in the bed . Which means that no matter how many dates she goes on, she can't find the right man for her and her felines. Lifelong cat lover Tabby bought female Birman Foxy and male Maine Coon Wolfie a year ago and has dedicated her life since to making sure they want for nothing. At home they rule the roost, sharing Tabby's bed and refusing to let her shut any doors so they can have complete reign over the house. Foxy likes the blinds opened as soon as it is light - meaning her owner rises at 4am every day to make sure her pampered puss can see out of the window. Potential suitors have told Tabby they'd like to ask her out but won't play second fiddle to Foxy and Wolfie. Others have refused to take the relationship any further than one date when they find out about her spoilt pets. And although she was seeing one easy going guy for just under a year, they broke up when her constant comparisons between his young child and her cats became too much for him. Just like a small child, Foxy and Wolfie are picky about their food and eat only the best in breed specific brands. When they're not modelling for Tabby's artwork, she wines and dines them at restaurants and hotels where cat friendly waiters bring out bowls of water and the moggies sit on chairs at the table. For Wolfie's first birthday Tabby threw a party complete with a cake and a stocking full of presents. And Foxy's extra-long hair needs so much attention that she grooms her two to three times a day. Tabby now mainly models hosiery, and regularly takes the cats to photo shoots with her where they get free rein to wander around the studio. But if she goes to work for a day and they can't join her on shoot, they stay with her mother who calls Tabby so she can chat to them on the phone throughout the day. Tabby even claims she has learnt to speak ‘cat' and says Wolfie can answer her with different types of miaows when she asks him a question.

'Who needs a man when I have Foxy and Wolfie's faces to wake up to every morning and they look forward to me coming home. 'I can imagine that people could find it a bit extreme but I'm not looking for a boyfriend at the moment anyway.

He got really annoyed because every time he said something about his child, I would compare it to my cats. 'Everything his child could do, my cats could do as well. 'Most dates just think I talk about them too much and that's too much for them. 'I can see how it could be a bit irritating but it's a case of ""love me, love my cats"". 'Everything I do for them is worth it - I don't mind ditching boyfriends and cutting nights out short because they come first. 'My cats live an unusual lifestyle but I love them so much I want to give them everything I can. 'They even come to the pet shop with me to choose the things they want. 'They do lunch in local bars and restaurants and they've very good and patient. They enjoy it.

'People dress up dogs and take them for walks so I don't see why it shouldn't be the same for cats. 'And because they're my darlings we celebrate their birthdays like we would one of my friends. 'They get a cake with their name on, a stocking full of toys and goodies as well as main present.'It's so nice to be able to treat them. 'It does all add up but they're totally worth it. 'People are often surprised when I arrive with them but because they're so happy and look so contented everyone just gets used to it. 'But Foxy and Wolfie come first. If they suddenly decided they weren't happy with the grooming or the walks or the clothes, I'd be the first to put it on hold. 'I guard them with my life - they're my darlings.'

"A Buddhist monk who said it's time for him to die has decided to lay in a coffin and 'meditate himself to death'. The Thai holyman told his followers that if he did indeed pass away, the coffin would self-combust on Thursday. The monk, Phra Khru Weruwan Chantarungsi, 65, who is also known as Luang Pu Pim, is the abbot of Wat Weruwan temple in Tambon Thung Phra in Thailand - and is in good health, according to temple representatives.

Heavens above: A Buddhist monk who said it's time for him to die has decided to lay in a coffin (pictured) and 'meditate himself to death' However, his daughter, 41-year-old Chanakarn Srisombat, insisted that he was poorly, according to the Bangkok Post. She added that he'd died once before in a cave but that a miracle had brought him back to life. Mr Pim's coffin was placed outside his living quarters on Tuesday after he'd delivered his last sermon, in which he explained that death something that comes to everyone. Detractors of Mr Pim's actions say that he's being anti-Buddhist, by 'showing off'. However, his followers strongly refute that he's seeking attention. Many of them have stayed at the temple to witness the coffin being consumed by fire. The coffin has several holes in it, to allow Mr Pim to breathe. The news follows controversy surrounding a Buddhist Chinese monk after it emerged he had accepted cash to bless a businessman's Porsche. A businessman's request to have his brand-new Porsche blessed in a temple in the city of Xiaogan, in eastern China's Hubei province, has really caused anger across the country . Recently everything from palatial new homes to controversial business ventures are beginning to be blessed, but it was the businessman's request to have his brand-new sports car prayed over in a temple in the city of Xiaogan, in eastern China's Hubei province, that has really caused anger across the country. Software development company boss Tao Hung brought the high-performance car to the monk so he could pray that he would drive safely in the vehicle and be 'lucky' in always reaching his destinations on time without incident. But critics have said that the blessing goes against Buddhist tradition and that greed and money are not part of the teachings - in fact greed, hatred, and delusion are known as the three poisons.","Monk Luang Pu Pim has told his followers that his time has come to die .

"Hint? Rupert Murdoch tweeted today that the Scottish are 'better people than to be dependants of London' as people believe his newspapers will back independence . Rupert Murdoch was today accused of readying his newspapers to back Scottish independence and his 'old friend' Alex Salmond. The media tycoon, who owns The Sun and The Times and a Scottish-based Sky TV call centre, said today: 'Scots are better people than to be dictated to by London'. His latest tweets are the biggest hint yet that his Scottish newspapers will side with the 'Yes' campaign, and admitted himself he is 'wrestling' with the idea. Mr Murdoch, who has Scottish ancestors, has previously described Alex Salmond as the ‘most brilliant politician in the UK’ and two years ago tweeted: ‘Let Scotland go and compete. Everyone would win.’. Critics have suggested the break up of the United Kingdom would be his 'revenge' for the damage caused to him and his businesses by the hacking scandal. He tweeted today: 'Scots better people than to be dependants of London. Hard choice with real pain for some time. Maybe too much. 'Wrestling with Scottish vote. Scottish Sun No. 1. Head over heart, or just maybe both lead to same conclusion'. In a further message Mr Murdoch also suggested Scotland had declined because of being part of the UK, saying it was 'sad' that the fishing village his 'forefathers' came from are 'now totally silted up'. His grandfather, Patrick John Murdoch, left Aberdeenshire for Australia in 1884 and he would qualify for citizenship if he wanted it. Scroll down for video . Critics have accused him of trying to influence next Thursday's poll and expect his Scottish papers to back the Yes campaign. Labour MP Tom Watson told MailOnline: 'Here we go again, Rupert Murdoch and his old friend Alex Salmond. 'This is new politics just like the old politics. Murdoch is trying to dictate the agenda’. Labour leader Ed Miliband brushed off Mr Murdoch’s remarks, suggesting the media tycoon does not want what is best for Scotland. Speaking at an event in Glasgow, Mr Miliband said: ‘As far as I know he doesn’t want a social democratic paradise.’ Supporter: Mr Murdoch, who has Scottish ancestors, has previously described Alex Salmond, together in 2007, as clearly the ‘most brilliant politician in the UK’ Other Twitter users have also turned on Mr Murdoch's tweets in recent days, even those who back the yes campaign. Yes supporter Misssy M wrote: 'Typical of Murdoch. Sniffs the wind and pretends it's him who changed it. Get tae, Rupert. We don't want you nor need you. This is our vote'. Labour activist Taylor James Scott said: 'Genuinely who cares what Rupert Murdoch's view is on Scotland's future? Given his actions in recent years I imagine the answer is no one'. Cameron Calder ‏said: 'Natz (nationalists) actually believe Murdoch cares about Scotland rather than getting revenge on UK'. One of his papers, the Sunday Times, published a poll at the weekend that showed the nationalists had pulled ahead of no voters. The Scottish Sun, which is Scotland’s best-selling daily newspaper, backed Mr Salmond’s SNP in the 2011 Scottish Parliament elections, but it did not support independence. At the weekend, following news of the YouGov poll for The Sunday Times, Mr Murdoch tweeted ‘everything up for grabs’. He added: ‘Scottish independence means huge black eye for whole political establishment, especially Cameron and Milliband (sic). ‘Scottish poll reflects world-wide disillusion with political leaders and old establishments leaving openings for libertarians and far left'. Some have claimed that his interest in the break up of Britain is based on revenge for the hacking scandal . Andrew Neil, a former editor of The Sunday Times, wrote on Twitter that he thought Mr Murdoch was preparing to support a Yes vote. He said: ‘Strong indications from Murdoch and Salmond sources that Scottish Sun will back independence, despite protestations of London Sun editor. ‘He thinks hacking scandal was revenge of the British establishment on him. Break up of Britain would be his revenge.’","Mogul said: 'Scots are better people than to be dictated to by London'

"On trial: Former Radio 1 DJ Dave Lee Travis arrives at Southwark Crown Court in London today . Dave Lee Travis told police that alleged sex assault victims were 'jumping on the bandwagon' as he denied attacking a TV personality on the Mrs Merton Show, a court heard today. The former DJ said the allegation he grabbed a woman's breasts at a BBC studio was ‘totally untrue’, in a police interview read to Southwark Crown Court in London. Travis, of Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, told officers he ‘would have been crazy to grope a woman in a corridor’, adding: ‘I absolutely, categorically did not grab her breasts.’ The 69-year-old ex-Radio 1 star told police he did not remember the alleged victim, but it was ‘possible’ he had urged her not to smoke and could have accidentally touched her body. ‘I like to get on with people,’ he said. ‘I don't like to leave people with a sour taste in their mouth. I suspect grabbing someone's breasts for 15 seconds would leave a sour taste in their mouth. ‘What would this be saying to her, “Your breasts are going to fall off if you smoke?”’ He added: ‘There has to be a realisation people can just jump on the bandwagon and have a crack at someone. Anyone could call and say DLT grabbed my a***. It's just too easy. ‘I don't understand why I'm being vilified. I remember the days people used to touch people and you would kick them in the balls. You didn't take them to bloody court.’ Travis said he did not know why the woman had made the allegation. ‘I may have p***** her off,’ he told police. ‘She may have taken a dislike to me.’ In an earlier police interview, Travis said he was a ‘target’ and the allegation he assaulted a woman at a panto he was starring in was ‘utter nonsense’. He said his former Radio 1 colleague Jimmy Savile was a ‘private person’ with a ‘verbal wall’ and he would have reported him had he known he was a paedophile. Earlier, the court heard from a comedian who said he had thought Travis was being ‘aggressive’ and not committing a Carry On-style ‘playful' act during the alleged assault on the Mrs Merton Show. Comedy chat show: Gorman, 43, said it was hard to be in touch with Mrs Merton star Caroline Aherne (pictured) now. This is a file photograph from 1995 . Dave Gorman said the former DJ had appeared as a guest on the comedy chat show when he heard later that Travis had ‘grabbed’ the woman’s breasts in the corridor of the BBC TV studio. The alleged victim, who was working as a part of the production crew at the time in the mid-1990s, told the court yesterday that veteran DJ Travis got a ‘weird sexual thrill’ as he squeezed her breasts. She also claimed the former Tops Of The Pops presenter had an ‘intense’ stare during the incident. Gorman, who was a writer on the Mrs Merton Show, told Travis’s retrial today: ‘I was told that as (the woman) was escorting Mr Travis back to his dressing room, he at some point....grabbed her t***. My recollection was everyone in the team would have known. ‘This was office gossip to some extent. My feeling was, if you think back to that time, the idea we’d call the police and say ‘Dave Lee Travis grabbed (the woman’s) t***’, wouldn’t have gone anywhere. ‘He had been and gone. I recall discussions and questions about whether it had been a sort of ‘Carry On film wahey’, which might be playful albeit ill-judged, or whether it was aggressive. My recollection was it was aggressive.’ Evidence: Comedian Dave Gorman (left, today) said DJ Dave Lee Travis (right, in 1976) had appeared as a guest on the Mrs Merton Show when he heard later that Travis had 'grabbed' the woman's breasts in a corridor . The female TV personality, who was in . her 20s at the time of the alleged assault, told the court yesterday . Travis had approached her while she was smoking and commented on her . ‘poor little lungs’, before he squeezed her breasts. She said she ‘froze’ as she was pinned against the wall by the DJ before he let go of her breasts after 10-15 seconds. Former Radio 1 DJ: Dave Lee Travis, 69, denies two counts of indecent assault and one of sexual assault . Stephen Vullo QC, defending Travis, told the jury that his client has ‘no recollection’ of the alleged victim. Wearing . a checked shirt, jeans and trainers, Gorman told the court he could not . recall who told him about the alleged assault but it was a day or two . after it was said to have happened. The . comic said he had spoken with the alleged victim after she was . contacted by police and when officers from Operation Yewtree called him, . he thought it must be about Travis. He . told the court the alleged assault ‘was never at the front of his mind’ over the years but it was not something he had ‘completely forgotten’. During . his evidence, Gorman, 43, said he still ‘exchanged Christmas cards’ with fellow Mrs Merton writer Craig Cash but the show’s star Caroline . Aherne was ‘a bit harder to be in touch with’. Travis, who is charged under his real name David Griffin, denies two counts of indecent assault and one of sexual assault. He . is facing a retrial on two counts - one of indecent assault of a woman . between November 1, 1990 and January 31, 1991, and another of sexual . assault on a different woman between June 1, 2008 and November 30, 2008 - . on which a jury was unable to reach verdicts at a trial earlier this . year. Travis has also pleaded not guilty to an additional count of indecent assault alleged to have taken place on January 17, 1995.

"Google's Mountain View headquarters boasts so many perks - like complimentary meals,  nap chairs and a free laundromat -  it's no wonder a few employees have hacked their way out of rent and made the 'Googleplex' their permanent address. A few Googlers told their stories about living on campus in a recent thread on Quora, with two ex-employees saying they camped out on campus for more than a year. Shana Sweeney, a former Google employee who worked in benefits, wrote that employees weren't 'technically' supposed to live on campus, but that many got away with it by 'living in their cars in the parking lot'. Scroll down for video . 24/7 Googlers: Several former Google employees claim they lived at the Mountain View campus, in cars parked in the lot, instead of paying rent. Above, a picture of ex-Googler Matthew J Weaver's camp at the campus, when he lived between July 2005 and August 2006 . Dare: Weaver says he started living on the Google campus when his initial sublet in Berkeley ran out, and a friend dared him to live in an RV instead . Home is where the car is: Brandon Oxendine lived out of his station-wagon for three months in the summer of 2012 while working at Google . She says she knew someone who lived out of a camper in the parking lot for 2-3 years, showering at the gym and taking advantage of the free meals in order to save up enough money to buy a house. Former programmer Ben Discoe bought a custom conversion van for $1,800 and lived out of that for 13 months, between October 2011 and November 2012. He says he lived in the lot because he had alimony and a house payment on his Hawaii farm to pay and 'no money left for South Bay rental prices'. Work life: Google is one of a few tech companies who entice their employees to work longer hours with awesome amenities . Free food: Perhaps enabling some employees to set up camp on campus is the various amenities, like free breakfast, lunch and dinner. Above, a Google chef makes hand-rolled sushi at the headquarters . Rec room: Above, an employee plays pool at a break area at the Googleplex in Montain View, California . Fresh perks: A Google employee gets an employee at a mobile hair salon on the campus . Snooze: Google employees are even encouraged to take naps with these state of the art black-out chairs . Discoe outfitted the van with a mattress from IKEA and curtains on the windows and eventually saved enough money to move to the Mission District in San Francisco. While living on campus did not seem to be encouraged, Discoe says no one ever tried to kick him out. 'It is very likely technically in violation of some obscure code or city ordinance. Google Security came by very early on, but once they determined that the guy in the mysteriously parked white van was just an eccentric Googler and not the Unabomber, they never came by again,' Discoe wrote. Long-time staff site ecologist Matthew J Weaver also lived on the Google campus for 13 months, between July 2005 and August 2006. However, he told MailOnline that the company was much smaller then and he doubts an employee today would be able to pull off the same feat. Parties in the parking lot: Weaver says he held parties with co-workers at his camper on Thursdays when the weather was nice. However, he added that living on campus meant it was hard to stop working, and he averaged 80-90 hour weeks . Home sweet Google: Above, another view of Weaver's set-up at the Google campus. He says it would be much harder for an employee now to get away with a similar camp, due to the company's growth . He says he did it on a dare from a coworker after his initial sublet in Berkeley ran out after six months, and he started looking for somewhere else to live. 'One thing led to another and he started sending me links to RVs on Craigslist. I found a really nice one ... basically, someone had died and left their RV to their daughter who wanted nothing to do with it. It was a 24-foot used RV and I parked it in the back corner of campus,' he told MailOnline. Weaver said the Google address ended up being 'excellent' for his career. 'We would hold regular parties at the RV on Thursdays when the weather didn't suck. I had an astroturf lawn and white picket fence for a while,' he wrote. Custom van: Ben Discoe also lived on the Google campus for a little more than a year in a van decked out with a mattress and black-out shades . However, one downside to living on campus was the winter, when the weather turned wet and filled Weaver's camper with condensation and the fact that it was hard to keep a work life balance. Weaver estimates he worked 80-90 hour work weeks when he lived on campus, and basically just worked and slept during the week in that period. He also wasn't able to work off Google's wireless parked that far out, so he had to buy his own cellular card to use the internet. Security also checked out his vehicle a couple of times, but Weaver says once they figured out he was an employee, they actually ended up keeping an eye on his stuff when he wasn't around. Brandon Oxendine, a former Google visual designer, lived on campus for a few months in the summer of 2012, when he slept in his Volvo station wagon in the parking garage. Like Discoe, Oxendine bought a mattress for the car, and installed black-out curtains for privacy, until he eventually moved to San Francisco. 'I've always enjoyed having very little possessions and have always had dreams of living out of a car ever since my first car (an old station wagon),' he said. 'I was in a unique situation working at Google where I had showers and food that were very convenient to me. I really enjoyed it and would do it again.' Discoe told MailOnline that he was never approached by security, but that he also kept his digs a secret for fear he could be fired. He says he decided to try living in a car as an experiment, and not for money. However, he added that the Bay Area housing market is notoriously awful and he was paying around $1,600 in rent each month, which was money he saved while living in the parking garage. MailOnline's emails to Google public relations were not immediately returned Wednesday morning.","In an online thread, several former Googlers told of how they lived in parked cars and campers on campus to save money on rent .
Two ex-employees wrote that they lived on campus for more than a year, and were never once told to leave .

"A former exotic dancer is suing the Dallas Cowboys and club's owner  Jerry Jones for $1million for sexual assault, claiming the 71-year-old business man groped her in a hotel bathroom. In an 11-page court document, Jana Weckerly of Ardmore, Carter County, Oklahoma claims she was sexually assaulted by Jones in either May or June 2009 and that the Dallas Cowboys should have done something to prevent it. The alleged assault is believed to have taken place in the bathroom of a luxury hotel. Jerry Jones, right, is accused of allegedly sexually assaulting the woman who took this photograph in 2009 . Billionaire Jerry Jones, pictured, claims he has been 'misrepresented' in the photos which were leaked online . A spokesman for Jones, who has been married for 50 years, said the photographs were part of 'a shake down' According to TMZ.com, the two women in the photographs are former strippers from Dallas called Lindzie, blonde and Jordan, brunette. The pair are understood to be consulting their own lawyers. Ms Weckerly claimed that Jones had 'forcibly rubbed' or grabbed her buttocks and breasts multiple times without her consent. The 27-year-old former exotic dancer also claims that Jones forced her to 'touch/and or rub' his penis and that 'forcibly penetrated' her with his fingers. The court document said that Jones forced her to watch a second woman perform a sex act on him. According to the document, seen my MailOnline: 'The conduct of defendant Jerry Jones was in violation of state and federal criminal statutes regarding sexual abuse.' Ms Weckerly claims that Jones' actions constitute 'extreme and outrageous conduct', accusing both the businessman and the football club of intentionally causing 'severe emotional distress'. The law suit also claims that the Dallas Cowboys failed to supervise Jones properly and should have introduced 'policies for the protection of females'. The document said: 'The reputation of Jerry Jones and Cowboys and the desire to avoid scandal were vastly superior and more important to the Cowboys than the welfare of the plaintiff and other victims who have been sexually abused by Jerry Jones.' Jerry Jones, right, pictured with his wife Gene, left, said he did not want to comment on the case . Ms Weckerly accused the Dallas Cowboys of 'fostering an environment and culture where abuse of females could flourish'. She said Jones had 'dangerous sexual propensities' towards women. The court document also claims that Jones and the Dallas Cowboys tried to cover up the alleged assault while Ms Weckerly said she was in fear for her life. The Dallas Morning News reported that photos of the alleged incident were published online last month. Jones told the paper: 'Someone has misrepresented photos taken at a restaurant five years ago for their own purposes. I'm just not going to comment on it.' However, Ms Weckerly's lawyer Thomas Bowers said his client was in counselling and is taking medication to cope with the trauma. He said: 'If anybody did something wrong, it was the Cowboys and Jerry Jones,” Bowers said. “Sometimes powerful people think they can get by with anything. 'It’s amazing how athletes are held to a different standard than the owners, who are allowed to do things an athlete would probably lose his job for. So, it’ll be very curious to see what the league does with this.' However, the Dallas Cowboys dismissed Ms Weckerly's claims. In a statement issued to 11alive.com, club spokesman Rich Dalrymple said they would be contesting the case. He said: 'These allegations are completely false. 'This is nothing more than an attempt to embarrass and extort Jerry Jones. This is a shakedown by a lawyer who is a solo practitioner just trying to make a name for himself.The alleged incidents would have been more than five years old. We intend to vigorously contest this complaint and expect it will be shown for what it is -- a money grab. Due to the seriousness of these baseless allegations, we have also involved law enforcement.'","Jana Weckerly claims Jerry Jones sexually assaulted her in a bathroom .

"Olive Garden may have run into a problem after its PR stunt on Monday selling a limited number of 'never-ending pasta passes'. Around 50 cunning buyers have placed the passes on eBay where they are being offered at double, and sometimes three times the price. The $100 golden ticket allows carb lovers to fill up on as much of the chain's signature dishes as they can eat. Pasta for everyone! Savvy buyers of Olive Garden's 'never-ending-pasta-pass' tried to resell it on eBay . Fans of the chain were able to buy a ticket to eat as much pasta as possible - along with bread sticks, salad and soup - for seven weeks between September 22 and November 9. Bids are being offered for the passes on eBay but none have yet been sold. As Daily Finance points out, the small print shows the 'pasta passes' are 'non-transferable and may not be re-sold'. And it seems that Olive Garden are playing strictly by the rules. In a statement to MailOnline today, an Olive Garden spokeswoman said: 'The Never Ending Pasta Passes are personalized and state that they’re non-transferable and not for resale, and we’re working with eBay to make sure buyers and sellers are aware of this. 'However, hospitality is core to who we are, which is why we’ll work with anyone who’s purchased a pass on eBay to ensure they enjoy Never Ending Pasta Bowl. I’d encourage those guests to reach out to us directly via phone or social media. ' The passes sold out within 45 minutes of being launched at 3pm on Monday. Only 1,000 of the passes were sold and covered the 150 combinations of pasta and sauce available at Olive Garden. The deal also includes unlimited soft drinks for the pass-holder and those at their table - but no alcohol. The pass can be used as many times as the user wants throughout the seven-week period at Olive Garden locations across the U.S. An Olive Garden location in Peoria, Illinois. The chain is offering a never-ending pasta pass which lets the holder eat as much pasta as possible over seven weeks at any U.S. location . Only 1,000 of the passes are being made available and covers a 150 combinations of pasta and sauce at the Italian food chain . The attention-grabbing promo comes at a tricky time for the chain. In July, the CEO and Chairman Clarence Otis stepped down as the Darden Restaurants company fights to fix its flagship Olive Garden chain following its contested sale of Red Lobster. For fans of the Olive Garden chain, getting value for money from the $100 pass should be simple - and done in under a week. Using only options available on the pass, a dinner of minestrone soup followed by spaghetti meatballs, a house salad and bread, typically costs roughly $36 (before tip). Even if the pass is used just once a day, then Olive Garden fans can chomp their way through $100, in just 72 hours. The company, based in Orlando, Florida, has been pressured to turn around declining sales at Olive Garden and Red Lobster. Customers had begun turning away from those chains as they cut back on spending during the recession. Darden Restaurants Inc. completed the sale of Red Lobster to investment firm Golden Gate Capital in July. There has also been concern from diners over the calorie contents of those bottomless pasta bowls. Olive Garden boasts a significant amount of meals that have more calories, saturated fat and sodium than is recommended - and even more than a McDonald's value meal, according to a Drexel University-University of Pennsylvania study in January.","Around 50 passes were being offered on eBay today - but Olive Garden warned they were 'non-transferable'

"A photographer has released dramatic new pictures that show one of the thousands of migrants who attempt to cross illegally into the United States through Texas, and members of the U.S. Border Patrol as they attempt to stop them.

"Chlorine gas was 'systematically and repeatedly' used against Syrian civilians in attacks on their villages this year, according to a new report. New findings by the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) conclude that the dangerous, choking gas was contained in bombs dropped on the settlements. The report does not pin blame for the attacks on anybody, though the Syrian Army, loyal to president Bashar Assad, have previously been blamed for horrifying chemical weapons attacks. Aftermath: Chlorine gas causes choking, lung damage and even death. Pictured above are two mourners standing over the bodies of alleged victims of a chemical weapons attack . International reaction: The Syrian regime earlier surrendered a huge cache of chemical weapons to be destroyed (pictured above are UN inspectors in the city of Ghouta) Earlier this year they admitted possessing an arsenal of chemical weapons - but all the stockpiles they declared to international agencies have now been removed. The global weapons watchdog interviewed victims, physicians, eye-witnesses and others and concluded that the signs pointed almost certainly to chlorine. Leader: Syrian president Bashar Assad has been blamed for numerous chemical weapon strikes . The substance is a toxic industrial gas that is not specifically classified as a chemical weapon. The chemical irritates the throat can cause victim's lungs to fill with water, drowning them. The gas can also attack the skin and eyes, causing burning, swelling, itching and irritation. An earlier report by the same OPCW mission also said chlorine likely was used as a weapon in Syria. A separate organisation, Human Rights Watch, said in May that it had strong evidence that this year Syrian army helicopters dropped bombs containing chlorine on the same rebel-held villages mentioned by the OPCW report. The attacks earlier this year came as Damascus and the OPCW were involved in a complex mission to remove Syria's stockpile of chemical weapons and precursor chemicals from the country. All of the poison gas, nerve agents and other chemicals declared by Syria have now been removed from the country and the most toxic parts of the arsenal destroyed. The OPCW said the fact finding mission would continue its work as there was 'a spate of new allegations' of chlorine attacks in Syria in August.

"A multiple sclerosis patient is being forced to pay £450 a month for a drug which means he can stand up, walk and shower - even though it is prescribed free on the NHS in other parts of the country. Phil Grace, from Great Tey in Essex, was diagnosed with MS in 2000 after suffering from symptoms since his mid-20s. Constant muscle spasms left the 59-year-old unable to sleep at night and relying on a stick to walk. But Mr Grace's life was transformed when he found a drug on the internet being used by other sufferers of MS. Phil Grace, 59,  has to pay £450 a month for drug Sativex, which helps control the muscle spasms he experiences due to multiple sclerosis, while people in other areas are prescribed the drug on the NHS . The cannabis-based drug Sativex controls Mr Grace's muscle spasms enabling him to walk up and down stairs and get in and out of the shower safely. He asked his GP if he could be prescribed Sativex but was left devastated when the Clinical Commission Group (CCG), which commissions care for the local area, refused to fund it. The former manager at BT said his only option is to pay £450-a-month out of his pension for 11 daily doses of the cannabis-based drug. Mr Grace said the 'postcode lottery' which gave some patients funding but not others was 'ludicrous'. He said: 'It is free in some areas and you can get it willy nilly in Wales but my local authority say it is not value for money. Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a condition of the central nervous system. In MS, the coating around nerve fibres (called myelin) is damaged, causing a range of symptoms. More than 100,000 people in the UK have MS. Symptoms usually start in your 20s and 30s and it affects almost three times as many women as men. Once diagnosed, MS stays with you for life, but treatments and specialists can help you to manage the condition and its symptoms. We don't know the cause and we haven't yet found a cure, but research is progressing fast. Source: Multiple Sclerosis Society UK= . 'It is absolutely ludicrous really, they have never looked at the bigger picture. 'I mean I wouldn't still be paying for it if it didn't work would I?' 'The point I would make is that I am on a postcode lottery for what I can get out of the system but we all have to pay in the same amount. 'I have paid all my taxes and I just want to get something back out of it. It just needs to be a level playing field. 'I don't understand because if I was to come off it now I am likely to get worse and cost them more money.' Mr Grace, who lives with his homeopath wife Deborah, 54, pays for his supply of Sativex with his disability living allowance and survives off his BT pension. He uses a private prescriptions service to buy the drug from producers GW Pharmaceuticals. Nice guidelines state that Sativex was not cost-effective as a treatment for MS, but that individual CCGs could decide whether to prescribe the drugs to individuals. Last month the NHS in Wales announced it would fund the medicine, following an appraisal by the All Wales Medicines Strategy Group. The drug, which is the first cannabis-based medicine to be licensed in the UK, has been used by patients when other treatments prove to be ineffective. NICE have said that Sativex, a cannabis-based drug, is not a cost-effective treatment for MS, but they are currently reviewing their guidelines on MS treatment and Sativex is included in this review . Georgina Carr, senior public affairs officer for the MS Society said: 'Unfortunately Phillip’s story is all too common - people with MS are too often subjected to a postcode lottery of access to treatments that could help them better manage the condition. 'Those who are refused treatment by their local health services are forced to pay large sums to private providers or simply go without. NICE’s recent recommendation was made within a limited process - we urge NICE to conduct a full technology appraisal of Sativex without delay.' A spokesman for the Mid-Essex Clinical Commissioning Group, who denied Mr Grace's funding application, said they may consider handing out Sativex if it is recommended by Nice. He said: 'Nice is currently reviewing its guidelines for the management of multiple sclerosis and is including Sativex in the scope of the consultation. 'The guidelines are due for publication in October after which the CCG will consider any recommendations. 'We do not routinely fund Sativex however patients have the right to be considered for exceptional funding if their GP or consultant feels they meet the criteria. 'A referral can be made to the CCG's exceptional case panel with clinical evidence to support the request.'","Phil Grace, 59, was diagnosed with MS in 2000 .

"A frustrated estate agent has taken a unique approach to selling a run-down three bedroom house - by blaming the property's less than sparkling appearance on 'some scumbag tenants'. The modest house in the city of Hamilton, western Victoria, was on the market for $109,000 before it was sold to a family who were ready to take on the challenge. A strikingly honest advertisement for the 'do-er up-er' on website RealEstate.com.au called the property a 'redecorator's delight'. Estate agent Helen Morrison told Daily Mail Australia her advertisement was a 'one off' and she wrote it in that way because 'it had been trashed' by 'squatters' who refused to pay rent. Honest: This small three bedroom house in Hamilton, western Victoria, was given a very frank advertisement . Trashed: One of the bedrooms (left) appears dingy and dirty. Two windows in the living room were smashed and the wooden floor was covered in marks (right) 'Very solid 3 BR WB with tiled roof - which has been trashed by some scumbag tenants. It's being sold ""as is"" and it needs redecoration,' the advert reads. On the upside, it states: 'Other than replacing a few cracked or broken windows, all the work needed could be done by anyone who is a bit ""handy"".' The pictures of the property that accompany the ad show its washed out walls and dirty looking cream curtains that are only half hanging on their rails. Telling it how it is: Estate agent Helen Morrison said her advertisement was a 'one off' The outdated cupboards have been stripped bare, the wooden floor in the living room looks marked and dirty, and the white bathroom floor also appears to be still muddy. 'It is a home which has had a second living room added to it and prior to the aforementioned tenants from hell, this was a delightful little home in a quiet court, very close to the golf course,' the estate agent said. 'It has a double garage and can be purchased as it stands for only $109,000... It's an excellent ""Do-er Up-er"",' she added. 'Redecorator's delight': The advertisement for the 'do-er up-er' was published on website RealEstate.com.au . Outdated: Even after the kitchen had been scrubbed up it still needed some serious redecoration . Muddy: The white bathroom floor looked dirty (left) and dirty curtains were left hanging off their rails (right) Ms Morrison said the unwanted tenants had been in the house for 'some months'. 'I think it started out as someone who was a friend of the owner who went to work over in Western Australia. But then they left and then another lot moved in and they didn't pay rent,' she explained. 'After a while nobody knew who was living there and they just trashed the place.' Frustrated: Ms Morrison said the unwanted tenants had been in the house for 'some months' Ruined: There were dozens of marks on the purple wall of one of the bedrooms . Ms Morrison said they did not have to get anyone to evict the squatters because the owner 'got them out in the end'.

"They are among the world’s most spectacular natural phenomena. But as many travellers who have braved the sub-zero conditions in the hope of witnessing the Northern Lights will be only too aware, there is no guarantee that the swirling light show will make an appearance. However, Norwegian cruise line Hurtigruten are so confident that holidaymakers will be able to witness the lights on one of their voyages that they are now offering visitors a free second trip if they are not visible. They say that anyone booking a £999 per person 11-night Classic Round Voyage around Norway between 1 October and 31 March next year before 30th November will be offered the deal. Spectucular: Travellers flock to areas such as Inari in Finland (pictured) to witness the Northern Lights . They say that if the Lights appear, an announcement will be made to everyone on-board by the Captain. If they do not make an appearance guests will be given a choice of joining the company’s seven-day Classic Voyage North, or six-day Classic Voyage South between 1 October 2015 and 31 March 2016, although they say that flights, which cost around £330 from Britain, will not be included. The company have become the first operator to offer such a promise, which coincides with an 11-year period known as ‘solar maximum’ by scientists when the Lights are more vivid than usual. Optimum Northern Lights viewings are the northern reaches of Finland, Iceland, Canada and Alaska . Displays of the Northern Lights occur when solar particles enter the Earth’s atmosphere and on impact emit burning gases that produce green, yellow and blue-coloured lights . Displays of the Northern Lights occur when solar particles enter the Earth’s atmosphere and on impact emit burning gases that produce green, yellow and blue-coloured lights. The scientific term for the Lights is the aurora borealis. The traditional places for optimum Northern Lights viewings are the northern reaches of Scandinavia, Finland, Iceland, Canada and Alaska. The Lights themselves can only be seen between September and March each year. Displays of the Lights are notoriously unpredictable and cannot be forecast in advance. In addition to the absence of the Northern Lights appearing, visibility can often be reduced by cloud cover and light pollution from nearby towns. Previous attempts to appease disappointed visitors have included the introduction of The Aurora Reykjavic centre in Iceland, a huge HD projection that aims to recreate the Northern Lights. A spokesman for Hurtigruten said: ‘It has been a truly spectacular couple of years for sightings of the Northern Lights in Northern Norway. Hurtigruten are confident holidaymakers will be able to witness the lights on one of their voyages . 'If you take a Classic Round Voyage with us, you will spend seven days out of the 12 under the key “aurora oval” area. ‘We cannot of course guarantee that you will see the lights during their voyage (only Mother Nature can do that). 'But we can do the next best thing which is to promise that if the lights prove elusive, we will give you another opportunity to see them next year.’ Dr John Mason MBE, renowned astronomer, aurora-hunter and Principal Lecturer at the South Downs Planetarium in Chichester, added: ‘For the best chance of seeing the Northern Lights, you need to stay in the auroral zone or be near to it. ‘This is a narrow ring, roughly around the Arctic Circle, that passes right over northern Norway. Hurtigruten's voyages spend seven days within or close to the auroral zone - no one else offers that. 'I have been incredibly fortunate that even when the weather forecast has been rather poor, I have never failed to experience the magical Northern Lights on a Hurtigruten voyage.’","The Lights are notoriously unpredictable and can't be forecast in advance .

"This optimistic polar bear's scheme for lunch didn't quite go to plan when he was sprung trying to sneak up on a herd of unsuspecting walruses. A series of photographs taken by a wildlife photographer in Svalbard, Norway, show the bear stealthily approaching a group of napping walruses. But when the group's walrus pups sound the alarm, one of the sleeping giants awakes and quickly fends him off. The polar bear begins cautiously approaching the herd from a distance while they doze on the beach and in the shallows . Once it gets closer, it begins lumbering towards the herd in the hope it can grab an easy lunch by catching them off guard . However its plan falls apart when the walrus pups panic and begin racing into the water. The remaining on shore pup (circled) was then protected by the adults . After rushing into the water, the walruses turned around to face the polar bear, which seemed confused to have created such panic . The polar bear, now realising it has no chance of successfully taking on the group, beats a hasty retreat in the face of the defensive adults . The remarkable photos show how the bear, spotting the dozing herd of walrus from a distance, begins slowly sneaking towards them along the water line. At first, the forty walruses carried on sleeping almost unaffected by his presence. But when the pups begin to panic and start charging into the sea, the adults fight back. Even for a polar bear, an adult walrus would be a formidable opponent. They can weigh up to 2,000kilograms and have been known to reach lengths of 5metres, and it did not take long before the bear beat a hasty retreat. A polar bear's diet is made up almost exclusively of seals and the improvised attack that was captured on camera was a major departure from its usual hunting method. Polar bears are famous for the patient game of hide and seek they play with seals, in which they wait near holes in the ice for a seal to pop up for air. When the seal sticks its head above the waterline, it's swiped up onto the ice and its skull crushed in one swift bite. Aftermath: The hungry polar bear sits down after the ordeal to quietly await its next opportunity for a meal .","Wildlife photographer captures the moment a crafty polar bear tries to sneak up on a herd of dozing walruses .

"The National Federation of the Blind is suing app-based ride-sharing service Uber alleging that it discriminates against passengers using guide dogs. The civil rights lawsuit, filed in federal court in San Francisco on Tuesday, claims that some Uber drivers have refused to give rides to blind people with service dogs and that others have mishandled the dogs or harassed their owners. The lawsuit was filed by the organisation’s California affiliate and Michael Hingson, a blind author and public speaker who lives in Victorville in San Bernardino County. Uber is being sued by the National Federation of the Blind who allege that it discriminates against passengers using guide dogs . 'Our right to independent travel is unjustly jeopardized when Uber drivers refuse to transport or harass blind customers due to the presence of their service animals,’ said Mary Willows, president of the National Federation of the Blind of California. The group said it is aware of more than 30 times blind customers who have been denied rides in violation of the American with Disabilities Act and California state law, reports CBS. As a result, blind passengers 'face the degrading experience of being denied a basic service that is available to all other paying customers,' the complaint said. In one instance a California UberX driver put a service dog in the trunk and refused to pull over when the blind passenger realized where the animal was. The lawsuit was filed by the organisation’s California affiliate and Michael Hingson, right, a blind author and public speaker who lives in Victorville in San Bernardino County. On another occasion a passenger was trying to explain that his dog was not a pet but a service animal when the driver allegedly cursed at him and accelerated abruptly, nearly injuring the dog and striking the passenger’s friend, who is also blind, with an open car door. Other cases include drivers allegedly abandoned blind travelers in extreme weather and charging cancellation fees after denying them rides. The lawsuit says the federation and Hingson have tried to negotiate with Uber to resolve their claims without a lawsuit, but were unable to do so. It asks for an injunction requiring Uber to take steps to ensure that its drivers don’t illegally refuse to transport blind people with service dogs. Uber has issued a statement saying it had not yet been officially notified of the lawsuit, but noting that its policy is to terminate the use of drivers who refuse to transport service animals. On one occasion a blind passenger was trying to explain that his dog was not a pet but a service animal when the Uber driver allegedly cursed at him and accelerated abruptly . ‘The Uber app is built to expand access to transportation options for all, including users with visual impairments and other disabilities,’ the statement said. ‘It is Uber’s policy that any driver partner that refuses to transport a service animal will be deactivated from the Uber platform,’ the company said. Based in San Francisco, Uber is a transportation network service that uses a smartphone application to connect passengers with drivers who are willing to give them rides for pay.","The National Federation of the Blind is suing Uber alleging that it discriminates against passengers using guide dogs .

"William Shakespeare famously penned the wisdom that a rose by any other name would smell as sweet. So what exactly is in a name? Apparently quite a bit, at least according to this list compiled by Kidspot, detailing the most definitive monikers likely to brand your child a 'bogan'. But first, a definition. bogan/ˈboʊgən/ (say ‘bohguhn) noun Colloquial (mildly derogatory) 1. a person, generally from an outer suburb of a city or town from a lower socio-economic background, viewed as uncultured; originally typified as wearing ugg boots and tights, or footy shorts and thongs in public and having a mullet hairstyle. Scroll down for video . The bogan baby-a new phenomena for Australia? Endearingly and embarrassing ingrained into Australian culture, the bogan is a familiar figure at the local pub, wearing footy shorts and thongs, or a bejewelled matching tracksuit and poorly disguised hair extensions. A harmless and often entertaining local legend, the bogan is as much a part of the nation's image as BBQ's and beaches. But is the cultural legend of the ever-present bogan possessive of characteristics a parent would want for their new child? Whilst parents can often be overwhelmed when searching for potential names for their progeny, it is best to choose wisely. A baby's sobriquet is, after all, branded onto birth certificates for all eternity. What does a name say about a person, or mean for a baby's future? It can seem safe to settle on a compromise of a traditional name spelled a new way, or to call a child after a person or place which evokes hopes for the future, but what do the names really mean for a new baby? Guru's of Aussie culture Kath and Kim poked fun at the prolific trend of creating a unique baby name. Baby Epponnee-Ray was the butt of many commentators jokes, as was the intention. And it seems that no young girl is complete without her very own apostrophe these days. Chris Lilley's Jai'me can attest to that, and with names such as Princ'ess making the cut, one can only wonder where the symbol might work its way into. As the list, which pokes fun at quite offensively and outrageously bogan titles, proves, getting adventurous with baby names may be fun, but perhaps not always wise. Chris Lilley's creation Jai'me King: ""It's spelled like Jaime, but I added the apostrophe"" Boys: . 1. Afernee . 2. Ashtyn . 3. Beejay . 4. Cruz . 5. Haze . 6. Holden . 7. Kash . 8. Storm . 9. Tyson . 10. Zaiden . Girls: . 1. Caprice . 2. Cheyenne . 3. Jorja . 4. Mercedes . 5. Nevaeh . 6. Princ’ess . 7. Rybekkah . 8. Shiraz . 9. Skylah . 10. Vegas . Recently, various spellings of common names such as Brittney and Mikayla, or Jacob and Jason, have all paved the way for names which make the list such as Jorja (Georgia). Mercedes, Cruz, Holden and Vegas all seem to fall into an 'aspirational' category of wanting fame, fortune, or glamour for one's child. So here is a selection of the top names, with commentary from Kidspot included (try not to laugh). Kash, Vegas, Tyson, Prin'cess and more bogan baby names! The Victorian Registry of Births Deaths and Marriages recorded that there were 6,932 unique girls names and 5,965 unique boys names registered in 2013. Jackson was a unique name growing in popularity, with 199 baby boys given the name last year. There were varied spellings of Jackson, with 140 boys were named Jaxon and 32 named Jaxson.  For girls, Isabella was a popular choice for girls with 332 plus variations including Bellas, Isobels, Mabels and Arabellas. Director and Registrar Erin Keleher noted that parents choose names for a range of reasons including honouring their family, tradition and popular culture, the Registry's website said. Whilst a bogan baby name is not a death sentence, and may even be a convenient conversation starter as the children get older, these names will certainly draw attention and probably questions. Winning gold in this particular event, which classifies as almost Olympian in the gymnastic-like contortions of regular names, is perhaps not something to aim for after all. How have you chosen your children's names? Making a name unique can be tough- so many parents settle for unique spelling instead .","Hilarious names for new babies .
Misspellings, apostrophes, and more!
Does your child's name make the top of the bogan list?
What does a name mean for a baby's future?
Caprice: French for “impulsive change of mind”, Caprice recalls a shiny Holden sedan and a clear-stilettoed stripper all at once. Not the classiest associations to be made with your daughter, but each to their own.
Anfernee: When you take an entirely respectable name like Anthony and deform it so it sounds like you’re missing your front teeth, you gots to be bogan.
Kash: Ah, a misspell of the already mega-bogan, money-grubbing name Cash. You’d better be ready for a massive five-finger dollar-sign ring and a gold tooth on this kid.
Vegas: While it’s been a tight race down this list, I do believe that naming your baby girl after the cheapest, tawdriest, most debaucherous city in the world takes the bogan cake.
Tyson: Sure, why not name your child after a bad-ass boxer with a face tattoo who did hard time for an unspeakable crime (allegedly)? Oh, but use his last name ‘cause dats mo’ bad-ass than plain ol’ “Mike”.
Princ’ess: As if naming your daughter Princess isn’t bad enough, you also feel the need to insert a completely random apostrophe in the middle of it? Similar specimens include D’Lilah and Al’xandra, but at least the apostrophe actually replaces a letter in these cases. (NB: that’s what apostrophes do)."

The robbers packed £80,000 worth of jewellery into two large bags before running out of the shop - all in under a minute. Scroll down for video . One of the customers in the shop at the time of the raid bravely snatched back one of the bags the robbers had filled, which contained £50,000 worth of jewellery . Owner John Davis said his business was . only saved by a customer who bravely snatched back a bag that contained . jewellery worth around £50,000 as the robbers fled. The 57-year-old grandfather, who released the CCTV footage, said: 'I have worked hard building up the business and have not taken a holiday in three years. 'You do all that and somebody comes in and snatches everything in just 48 seconds. 'The first we knew something was happening was when we heard two massive bangs at the door. 'It was mayhem in the minute that followed and I pleaded with them to not take the jewellery. 'I said they may as well kill me because the last few years have been really tough. I said: ""Please don’t do this, it will ruin me"" but they didn’t care. 'The customer who grabbed the bag from them effectively kept me in business.

'The police took the bag to check for forensics and we only found out what was in it when it was handed back. It turned out to be the most valuable bag they had. 'Had they escaped with it, £30,000-worth of losses would have turned into £80,000. It was a very brave thing for him to do. 'Without the bag I would have had to shut the shop. I think he saw how stressed I was and he made an instinctive grab for it.' The robbers broke into the store in the city's Jewellery Quarter at 10.40am on August 26.

Shop owner Mr Davis, a father-of-two, described how the robbers packed two large bags with jewellery in under 48 seconds. He said he has had to increase his security since the raid . He said: 'I wish there was more security in the area for traders. The police station has closed, but this is a high-risk area. 'I have had to increase my own security measures. I assume a lot is going on in the background with the police investigation, but I have heard nothing from them. 'As well as the financial loss the other big issue is the lasting impact. You are always on edge and worried it will happen again, but I just have to plod on with what I have left.'

"A driver fiddling with his laptop who ran over and killed a young cyclist has been jailed for three years today. Raymond Isherwood, 53, ploughed his black VW Golf into Jake Gilmore, 19, and sent him crashing onto the bonnet, the windscreen and over the roof. Photographer Isherwood insisted he was 'completely distracted' and he didn't spot the cyclist as he was trying to eject a CD from his laptop and put it in his car music player until he felt his Volkswagen Golf hit an object. Raymond Isherwood (left) was jailed for three years for running over and killing Jake Gilmore, 19, as the teenager cycled home from his job as a pub chef;  Isherwood insisted he was 'completely distracted' and he didn't spot the cyclist as he was trying to eject CD from his laptop and put it in his car music playe . Bristol Crown Court heard Isherwood did not attempt to brake or stop. He fled the scene and then parked his car away from his address in Royal Victoria Park, covered the smashed windscreen and dents with a plastic sheet from his boot to conceal the damage, and went home 'waiting for police to catch up with him'. Mr Gilmore was found by passers-by lying fatally injured in the street, Midland Bridge Road. Emergency services rushed him to the Royal United Hospital, Bath, where he was pronounced dead from 'non survivable head injuries' at 4am on November 17. Isherwood was jailed for three years after he admitted causing death by dangerous driving, failing to stop at an accident and perverting the course of justice. Rupert Lowe, prosecuting, said: 'Jake Gilmore was cycling home from work at the Lion and Lamb pub, which was a regular 15 minute journey for him. 'Mr Isherwood then drove up behind him and drove straight into him, knocking him on the bonnet, the windscreen and the roof, before he fell into the road behind. 'Mr Isherwood knew he had hit someone but he failed to stop. He later told police he didn't even break or take his foot off the accelerator.' Mr Gilmore, who was not wearing a helmet, was hit at 9.30pm on Saturday November 16, as he cycled home from his job as a pub chef. Isherwood  fled the scene and then parked his car away from his address in Royal Victoria Park (above), covered the smashed windscreen and dents with a plastic sheet from his boot to conceal the damage . Isherwood claims he was driving at around 33-34mph but did not see Mr Gilmore because he had been fiddling with a laptop to eject a CD. Police found the car at 9.30pm the next day and matched fragments of its grille to debris left at the scene and arrested Isherwood on November 19, having to break the door down to gain entry. Police also found 46 cannabis plants growing in cupboards at the property. In his police interview, Isherwood said he hoped he had hit a dog and claimed he had been distracted by attempting to move a music CD from his laptop to car player. But forensic examination of the laptop proved Isherwood's story could not be correct and it did not have fragments of glass from the broken windscreen in it. Charles Lowe, defending, told the court Isherwood was a man of previous good character, with a clean licence and it was his first accident in 20 years. He also admitted the production of cannabis and failure to surrender to police bail. Raymond Isherwood, 53, ploughed his black VW Golf into Jake Gilmore, 19, and sent him crashing onto the bonnet, the windscreen and over the roof in this road . Sentencing Isherwood, of Bath, Somerset, to three years in prison, Judge Michael Roach, said: 'Jake was 19-years-old. He was in the prime of his life. 'He was a much-loved son and brother. The impact on his friends and family is profound. 'You have not only caused Jake's death, you have blighted, very severely, the family's life. Their suffering would have been made worse by the callous way you left the scene.' Toby and Sue Gilmore said: 'There can be no doubt; the loss of our eldest son Jake, so suddenly and pointlessly has been the worst thing that could possible happen to us. 'His loss has inflicted emotional wounds from which we do not believe we will never recover. The space he has left can never be filled. 'Jake was less than two months short of his 20th birthday. He had only left home three months before he was killed. 'We had tried to teach him what life had to offer, and equipped him to take advantage of it. 'He was still young enough to perceive life as a great adventure, and we were looking forward to sharing it with him. 'We were advised that the sentence given to the driver is unlikely to reflect the enormous loss we now have to try and live with, but it is a relief that this process has now come to a conclusion.'","Raymond Isherwood, 53, was 'completely distracted'  as he was trying to eject CD from his laptop as he drove in Bath .

"The family of murdered student Holly Bobo, who went missing three years ago in Tennessee, have condemned her killers as soulless - as police say they are hunting more people in connection with her death. Miss Bobo, 20, disappeared from the town of Parsons in April 2011. Police and volunteers scoured the area in a desperate search, but nothing was found until her skull was unearthed on Sunday. The discovery led her family to make an impassioned statement, iterating their loss and rounding on her killers. Scroll down for video . Loss: Nursing student Holly Bobo was seen being led from her Tennessee home in April 2011 . In a statement read by their lawyer, and reported by NBC, her family said: 'We’ve lost a precious daughter, sister, granddaughter, niece, cousin and friend. 'However, . those responsible have lost their souls. Holly’s soul is the one thing . that their brutality could not diminish or extinguish.' It was the first time her family have spoken publicly about the loss of Miss Bobo. So far four men have been charged over her disappearance - two with her kidnap and murder murder and two more with tampering with evidence. But yesterday a police spokesman said that even more people could be involved, and that officers were hunting further suspects as investigators continue to comb the area where the skull was found. New break: Police in Tennessee used DNA tests to determine the human remains belonged to the 20-year-old . Confirmed: The Tennessee Bureau of Investigation said Monday night that remains of Holly Bobo were found on Sunday . In the wake of Miss Bobo's disappearance her brother told police that he saw a man dressed in camouflage leading her away into the woods. She had been preparing to go to class at nursing school on the morning of her disappearance. The director of the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation (TBI) said the Bobo investigation has been the most expensive and exhaustive in TBI history, and it's not over yet. Since she disappeared, the small town of Parsons and surrounding areas in West Tennessee tried to support the family, putting up pink ribbons on lamp posts, mailboxes and storefronts. Miss Bobo was wearing a pink shirt and carrying a pink purse before she disappeared. Two men found a skull Sunday not far from property owned by the family of Zachary Adams, who has been charged with Bobo's kidnapping and murder. He has pleaded not guilty. The area near his family's property was searched in March. District Attorney General Matt Stowe speaks as TBI Director Mark Gwyn listens on Monday night . A second man facing murder and kidnapping charges, Jason Autry, also has pleaded not guilty. Recently elected District Attorney Matt Stowe said his office was preparing to seek a possible death penalty in the case. A decision is expected in coming weeks, after he consults with the Bobo family, he said. 'The evidence is voluminous,' Stowe said. 'We are going to make sure that everyone who played a part in the heinous crime that has attacked the peace and dignity of the state of Tennessee faces a consequence for that.' In . May, brothers Jeffrey Pearcy and Mark Pearcy were both charged . with accessory after the fact and tampering with evidence. Like Autry and Adams, they have pleaded not guilty. Scene: Police closed off an area of woods in Decatur County after two people looking for ginseng came across a human skull on Sunday morning . Charged: Zachary Adams (left) and Jason Wayne Autry (right) are suspected of kidnapping and killing Bobo . Jeffrey Pearcy allegedly showed a friend cell phone footage of Bobo tied up and crying before her murder. The friend, Sandra King, testified at a preliminary hearing in May that she saw Zachary Adams in the footage. Mrs King also claimed that Jeffrey Pearcy told her that his brother Mark had filmed the incident. 'I seen a woman that was tied up that was crying,' King told the court, WMC reported. 'She was blonde... It looked like Holly Bobo.' King said it appeared the blonde in the video was about to be sexually assaulted, but she did not see. 'I knew what he was fixing to do. I did not want to see,' King said. The Tennessee Bureau of Investigation has not seen the video. Jeffrey Pearcy has denied the video exists and agents are now trying to find out if it is on his cell phone. 'I have no video. I have not seen a . video, never even heard of the video until I was questioned about it the . day of my arrest,' Pearcy said in June. Denials: Jeffrey Pearcy said that he does not have a video which could help solve the murder and disappearance of Holly Bobo, has never met her and doesn't know her family . Jeffrey Pearcy, left, and Mark Pearcy, right, have both been charged with accessory after the fact and tampering with evidence . Revelations: Witness Sandra King testified at a . preliminary hearing in July that she saw missing student Holly Bobo . tied up and crying in cell phone footage shown to her by Jeffrey Pearcy . King worked with police to try and have Pearcey acknowledge the video in a phone call. 'I . said to him, ""You know that video of Holly, if it would have been you . in that video, I would have watched it,"" and he said, 'Yes I know', . King said. Both men have pleaded not guilty. Adams was indicted in March on charges of especially aggravated kidnapping and first-degree murder. Autry,was indicted in April on first-degree murder and especially aggravated kidnapping charges. Heartbroken: Holly's mom Karen Bobo is led into court by attorney Steve Farase in March, when Adams was charged with her murder and kidnap . TBI . director Mark Gwyn previously said the agency has sworn statements from . witnesses who claim to have seen Bobo alive with Autry and Adams after . she had been reported missing. Gwynn added that they also had physical evidence being analyzed at two crime laboratories, and several witnesses. 'We believe other individuals have knowledge, and possibly others have involvement,' Mr Gwyn told News Channel 5. 'They can expect us to be on their doorsteps very soon.' He . added: 'This is a case the TBI has been continuously working hard to . solve now for three years. It has not been easy but I do know truth will . prevail.' 'Anyone who had anything to do with Holly's disappearance will be brought to justice,' he added. Threats: Adams appears in court earlier this year over claims he threatened his brother, who is a witness in the case . Suspect: Jason Wayne Autry has been charged with the kidnap and murder of Holly Bobo . The . first major break in the case came in February, when the Tennessee . Bureau of Investigation agents and FBI searched several areas around . Decatur, including the home of Zachary Adams. Adams, was arrested and charged shortly afterwards. Adams . appeared in court in April on charges of coercion of a witness after . allegedly making threats to his brother who is due to testify against . him. Adams' brother allegedly told the FBI he had seen Miss Bobo, 20, alive at his home after she was reported missing. Adams is accused of asking a fellow inmate to tell his brother: 'He's the one who started this s*** and if he don't shut his mouth he will be in the hole beside her,' CBS News reported. Autry, 39, has been indicted with especially aggravated kidnapping and first-degree felony murder. He is already in prison serving a three-year sentence for aggravated assault.

"A Boston gang member who posted photos of himself on Twitter holding guns after being banned from having weapons is set to be sentenced to prison today. Convicted felon Kwmaine Davis, 23, posted two photos of himself holding the guns at a firing range in Salisbury in March. A Boston police officer who had been secretly following Davis on Twitter saw the photos. Breaking his ban: Kwmaine Davis posted two photos of himself holding the guns at a firing range in Salisbury in March (pictured) Davis pleaded guilty to being a felon in possession of a firearm. His lawyers and prosecutors have agreed to recommend 18 months in prison as part of a plea agreement. Davis had been convicted of illegal possession of a firearm and ammunition in 2009. That felony conviction made it illegal for him to possess a gun, even at a firing range. He was originally convicted of being associated with H-Bloc, a gang that operates in Roxbury. The H-Block gang, so called because it operates in an area just north of Franklin Park where most of the street names begin with H, is well-known to police.

"While some chefs these days can be full of hot air, top chef Angelique Schmeinck cooks with it hundreds of feet from the ground on her unique hot air balloon restaurant. Dutch cook Schmeinck can host up to 14 diners as they take flight and experience not just stunning views of Holland but culinary delights prepared in the sky. The customised balloon has everything a chef could need and more to serve up a variety of tasty morsels, with Schmeinck even using its flame to prepare elements of dishes including Scottish lobster, coquilles Saint Jacques (scallops with wine and mushrooms), wild sea bass and guinea-fowl. It likely comes as no surprise that CuliAir Sky Dining doesn't come cheap with a somewhat inflated price of  £360-a-head, a cool £140 more than the tasting menu at Heston Blumenthal's The Fat Duck. For their outlay though diners, who spend at least 75 minutes in the air, get an aperitif and nibbles before take-off, three courses and cooking demonstration, matching wines and a copy of the chef's book, Swingen in de Keuken.

"Rescuers were left horrified at the facial injuries of a blood-soaked woman - only to discover she was wearing 'zombie make-up'. Tracy Morgan, 37, was on a fancy dress weekend dressed as one of the undead - complete with gruesome face paint -  when she fell 15ft down a cliff on a remote island in Wales. The horror film fan, who was taking part in a  'Zombie Survival Weekender' had to be rescued by coastguards, who were convinced she would need plastic surgery. But despite her appearance - which saw her made-up to seem as if chunks of flesh were falling from her face - she was not seriously injured. Scroll down for video .

Organiser Dom Spens added: 'Zombie Survival Weekender is a physically challenging, testing, full-on experience. We have done well over the past four years not to have any serious accidents or incidents. 'This weekends birthday event was unfortunately cut short on the first of our two nights of Pirates vs Zombies adventure when our most highly decorated marshal bravely swallow dived from a cliff and dashed her head on the rocks below.

"Patients have a ‘human right’ to be told if they have dementia, the new head of the NHS has declared. GPs should always seek to diagnose the illness and not make the assumption that sufferers would rather stay in the dark, said Simon Stevens. He warned that there was an ‘attitude of fatalism’ about dementia in the NHS – and society – with both patients and doctors thinking ‘nothing could be done’. Scroll down for video . Human right: NHS chief executive Simon Stevens (pictured) said dementia patients must be diagnosed . Mr Stevens is now issuing new guidelines for family doctors which set out the importance of diagnosing dementia, which is characterised by failing brain functions such as memory loss. Figures suggest that 850,000 Britons have the syndrome but half have never been formally diagnosed. And in some GP surgeries only 13 per cent of patients with the condition have been given a diagnosis – fewer than one in seven. The low figure is partly because patients and their relatives are reluctant to tell doctors about dementia symptoms because they assume it is just old age – or pointless because there is no cure. Some GPs are also unwilling to send elderly patients for scans as they want to protect them from the news that they have an illness for which there is no treatment. But Mr Stevens said that once patients were diagnosed they could be offered medication to help stave off symptoms as well as crucial support and advice. Devastating: Some 850,000 Britons are thought to have an undiagnosed form of dementia (posed by model) Addressing a conference of the Alzheimer’s Society in London, he said: ‘Let’s face, it there has been an attitude of fatalism about dementia which says, “there’s nothing much that can be done and therefore I’d rather not know because when I do, no good can be done”. That is the wrong way of thinking. ‘Medication does help many people become more themselves for a useful period of time. ‘There’s an opportunity for individuals and families to maximise joyful activities, plan and mitigate against potential difficulties and crises. It’s increasingly important that we diagnose and code patients with early dementia so that their risk of deteriorating may be understood when they go into hospital. New guidelines: Mr Stevens was named the new chief executive of NHS England earlier this year . ‘Most importantly of all, it seems to be a basic human right for patients to know about their own medical condition.’ Mr Stevens, who took up the post in April, added: ‘We’re moving away from the concept of protecting patients from the diagnosis because nothing can be done and towards offering timely diagnosis for patients. ‘We should respect the decision of patients and their families to present themselves at a time that is right for them. But that should not excuse inaction on the part of the National Health Service.’ The Government says that by next year, two thirds of dementia patients will have been given a formal diagnosis. Yet Professor Alistair Burns, the NHS’s national clinical director for dementia, told the conference there were some surgeries in England where the rate was just 13 per cent. He said he would be visiting these practices to find out why they are failing to diagnose so many patients. One GP based in West Lincolnshire said she was reluctant to tell patients they had dementia because there was so little support and treatment on offer. The doctor – who did not give her name – said: ‘I’m not against diagnosing early, it’s just what do I do afterwards.’ There is no cure for dementia, although there are a handful of drugs available on the NHS which can temporarily slow its progression by a few months. Last year the NHS gave GPs new incentive payments for increasing diagnosis rates. All suspected dementia patients must be referred to memory clinics. The NHS now compiles diagnosis data for every surgery and compares the figure to the number that would be expected given the surgery’s population.","Comments made by incoming NHS England chief executive Simon Stevens .

"Four firefighters in a Chicago suburb have been relieved of their duties for refusing to remove American flags from their lockers and helmets. The four were disciplined after they refused to comply with an order issued last week by Maywood Fire Chief Craig Bronaugh. He claims that there is a culture of racism in the department and issued a strict memo saying all decals and stickers, including American flags and military stickers, should be removed from lockers and helmets. Fire Chief Craig Bronaugh has disciplined four firefighters in Maywood, Illinois, after they refused to remove American flags from their lockers and helmets . The firefighters, including an African American, a Cuban and two white men, deny the chief's allegations of racism in the department . 'As a fire chief here, I cannot afford nor tolerate,' he told WGN. He cites a picture of a monkey smoking a cigarette that he found taped on a locker as evidence of the racist culture. However the firefighters - who include an African American, a Cuban and two white men - deny the chief's allegations. They claim the offending image was put up ten years old as a joke about someone who was a heavy smoker. They say the tension started when the chief ordering an American flag be removed from the inside of the fire station.

"What does two times six equal? In this case, it’s a dozen twins - all starting at the same primary school on the same day. The remarkable line-up of four-year-olds is likely to require double the concentration for teachers and classmates. But yesterday they were looking forward to ensuring they can put the right names to all the new faces. Scroll down for video . Matched up: Six sets of twins are starting in this year's foundation class at Montpelier Primary School in Plymouth, Devon.

Unusual situation: Montpelier Primary School headteacher Jason Holland (pictured) said the school is 'very lucky to have them all with us' Back to school: The two identical and four non-identical sets of twins are enjoying their first full week at Montpelier Primary School in Plymouth . ‘It has been school policy to try to . split sets of twins up where possible, and we’ve managed to do that . across the three foundation classes. Fraternal or non-identical twins are produced when two egg cells are fertilized separately. Identical or monozygotic twins are formed when one fertilized egg divides. All women have approximately the same chance of having identical twins – about one in 350 to 400. Identical twins do not run in families. However, there are some factors that make having non-identical twins more likely: . ‘The . whole idea then is that the twins can be mutually exclusive, can branch . out on their own and have separate groups of friends.’ Despite best intentions, there were still a few tears on a nerve-racking first day, and not just for the children. Kate . Lewin, mother of Jack and Thomas, said: ‘They’re my first to start . school, so it’s been exciting and upsetting all at the same time. ‘At one point I was walking up to . their classroom door with one gripped around each leg. They’re so close, . so one crying just sets the other one off. But it’s lovely that they’ve . got other twins to make friends with.’ Stephanie . Gray, mother of Lola and Naomi, said: ‘It’s just so bizarre, isn’t it? 'I . never thought there would be this many sets of twins starting at the . same time. 'My two are used to being unique, and now they’re two in a . crowd. It’s lovely to see though.’ First . reports said the twins were delighted to find themselves in the company . of other twins and were happily getting to know one another. Dressed in matching green uniforms, they were also helping to remind class teachers who was who. Many multiple births are a happy surprise but experts say numbers are increasing because of the rise in infertility treatments and the fact women are leaving it later to have children. In 2012 there were 11,228 sets of twins born in England and Wales, compared to 8,776 in 1998. About one in every 64 births in the UK today is twins, triplets or more. Jane Denton, director of the Multiple Births Foundation, based at London’s Hammersmith Hospital, said: ‘In recent years and because of infertility treatments, the number of twins born has been rising.’ She supported the policy adopted by many schools to try to separate twins if possible. ‘Each twin relationship should be looked at to see what suits the children best but being in separate classes can bring huge benefits,’ she said. ‘It’s important for teachers, friends and everybody to see them as individuals.’","Two identical and four non-identical sets of twins enjoying first full week at Montpelier Primary School in Plymouth .

"The campaign for Scottish independence suffered a double blow today after two major businesses warned against the dangers of separation. Scottish financial giant Standard Life revealed it was putting in place plans to move parts of its business to England to protect itself against independence. It came as Britain’s biggest fuel company BP warned against voting ‘Yes’ next week. It released a statement saying the prospects for North Sea oil were best served by the UK. Lib Dem cabinet minister Danny Alexander said the interventions had been Mr Salmond's 'Black Wednesday'. Scroll down for video . First Minister Alex Salmond's campaign for a Yes vote suffered a blow after a number of companies came out against independence . Standard Life chief David Nish said his firm was preparing to move big chunks of his company to England in the event of a 'Yes' to independence vote . Mr Alexander said the Standard Life and BP statements had come after £2billion had been wiped off the value of a number of top Scottish firms – including RBS, Lloyds, Stagecoach and others – amid fears over independence. He also pointed to remarks by the Governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, who said a currency union was incompatible with being independent. The giant bank Credit Suisse yesterday claimed a separate Scotland would face huge austerity, falling wages and would fall into a ‘deep recession’. Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander said: 'This is the day the economic case for separation died and reality that independence will cost jobs, investment, and growth dawned. Today is Alex Salmond's Black Wednesday.’ Standard Life boss David Nish released a statement to investors highlighting the ‘constitutional uncertainly’ in the 18 months after independence. He said the company would ‘take whatever action is required to protect our customers' interests’ by moving huge chunks of its business south of the border. Mr Nish said: ‘There continues to be uncertainty around a range of issues material to Scotland's future in the event of Scotland separating from the United Kingdom.’ He said these included ‘the currency that an independent Scotland would use’, whether Scotland would be in the EU and the ‘arrangements for financial services regulation’ in an independent Scotland . It was also unclear what tax would be levied on savings and pensions, he said. BP Chief Executive Bob Dudley has backed claims that Alex Salmond is vastly overstating the amount of oil left in the North Sea . He added: ‘In view of the uncertainty around Scotland's constitutional future, we have put in place precautionary measures which would help enable us to provide customers with continuity. ‘This includes planning for new regulated companies in England to which we could transfer parts of our business if there was a need to do so. ‘This transfer of our business could potentially include pensions, investments and other long-term savings held by UK customers.’ He added: ‘Standard Life has a long history in Scotland – a heritage of which we are very proud – and we hope that this continues but our responsibility is to protect the interests of our customers, our shareholders, our people and other stakeholders in our business.’ BP’s intervention today meanwhile warned voters not to trust Alex Salmond’s estimates for North Sea oil. The oil company’s boss Bob Dudley backed warnings by the oil industry’s most eminent businessman that Mr Salmond’s economic case for separation relies on highly inflated estimates for North Sea tax revenue. Mr Dudley said Sir Ian Wood’s assessment that the North Sea would be all but spent by 2050 was correct and used Scots to vote No. His opposite number at Shell also backed the estimate. Sir Ian Wood, who has been praised by both David Cameron and Mr Salmond as the industry's foremost figure, warned Scottish voters were using their hearts rather than their heads in weighing up the independence debate. Mr Dudley said: ‘BP has been in the UK North Sea for 50 years and we hope to operate here for many years to come. However, the province is now mature and I believe Sir Ian Wood correctly assesses its future potential. ‘The opportunities today are smaller and more challenging to develop than in the past. We also face the challenges of extending the productive life of existing assets and managing the future costs of decommissioning. ‘Much of this activity requires fiscal support to be economic, and future long-term investments require fiscal stability and certainty. ‘Our business invests for decades into the future. It is important our plans are based on a realistic view of the North Sea’s future potential and the challenges the industry faces in continuing to operate here. ‘As a major investor in Scotland – now and into the future – BP believes that the future prospects for the North Sea are best served by maintaining the existing capacity and integrity of the United Kingdom.’ Mr Cameron made an impassioned plea for the union during his visit to the Scottish Widows offices in Edinburgh today .","Standard Life reveals  plans in place to move parts of its business to England .

"The private clinic where Joan Rivers underwent a routine medical procedure has denied that 'a biopsy of the vocal cords' has ever been carried out there . The private clinic where Joan Rivers underwent a fatal routine medical procedure has denied that 'a biopsy of the vocal cords' has ever been carried out at the facility. The announcement follows claims last night that the comedian's personal doctor performed a surprise biopsy on her vocal cords at the Manhattan clinic last month. The 81-year-old comedian stopped breathing during the routine outpatient procedure and was on a life support machine until it was switched off last week. Yorkville Endoscopy clinic also denied that Rivers was under general anesthesia and stated that the only levels of sedation used at the facility is 'light to moderate sedation' according to the New York Daily News. Rivers was not mentioned by name in the statement with the clinic citing patient confidentiality rules. Yesterday the New York Daily News reported that according to a source with knowledge of the legendary comic's death, the biopsy by her personal doctor allegedly caused Rivers' vocal cords to spasm and her airways to constrict. The doctor who performed the biopsy did so with medical instruments from Yorkville Endoscopy after their own medical professional noticed 'something' on Rivers' vocal cords during the routine surgery, said the source who spoke with the New York Daily News. 'He asked and they let him,' the source said. 'A huge no-no.' Yorkville Endoscopy clinic also denied that Rivers was under general anesthesia and stated that the only levels of sedation used at the facility is 'light to moderate sedation' The source claimed that had the procedure been done in a hospital the comedian might not have died after doctors placed her in a medically induced coma after she went into cardiac arrest that morning. The Fashion Police star had only agreed to undergo an endoscopy at the Upper East Side clinic said the source and not the more risky biopsy, which would have tested whatever was removed for cancerous cells. No one from Rivers' team commented on the new statement. The identity of Rivers' doctor, who identified himself as an ear, nose and throat specialist, is not known at this time. Sad day: Melissa Rivers and son Cooper weep outside Joan Rivers funeral in New York City on Sunday as tens of celebrities gathered to pay their respects . Cooper Endicott and Melissa Rivers depart the Joan Rivers memorial service at Temple Emanu-El in Manhattan on Saturday . The clinic is federally licensed and according to a spokesperson has performed 18,000 procedures since opening in Feburary 2013. There is no criminal investigation underway following the legendary comic's death on September 4 at Mount Sinai Hospital, after spending a week in a medically induced coma after going into respiratory and cardiac arrest at the clinic. Her daughter, Melissa and grandson Cooper had rushed from Los Angeles to be at her side following the botched surgery. However, last week the Hollywood Reporter stated the NYPD had looked at the case because it may not be deemed to be from 'natural causes'. Although it might end up being ruled natural by the medical examiner the cause of death is still not clear so it is routine procedure for the NYPD to investigate. The New York Department of Health has also launched a review of the clinic. Last week, a 1985 interview on Good Morning America was discovered in which Rivers revealed that she was suffering from arrhythmia - a condition the causes the heart to beat out of sync. Rivers referred to it as a 'ladies' problem' that affects one in four women. While relatively common, the heart trouble unnerved her, she confided. 'All of a sudden you'll be on stage and hear 'tha-thump,' she told Lunden, striking her chest with her hand for emphasis. 'It scares the hell out of me.' Rivers, who had become a poster girl for excessive plastic surgery over the years, explained that going under the knife while suffering from arrhythmia could pose a risk. 'When you go under, say for plastic surgery or something like that, that's when your heart can go out of kilter. So I'm always very careful,' she said in an off-hand remark that has proven eerily prophetic. An autopsy that has been performed on Rivers failed to find a cause of death pending additional tests. It has been reported that before going in for surgery, the Fashion Police co-host got a clean bill of health from her doctors and appeared to be in good physical condition. Last performance: Joan Rivers accepts a bouquet of flowers at the end of her last show in Manhattan on August 27 . Yorkville Endoscopy opened 18 months ago and specializes in digestive disorders. It is owned by 12 highly-respected gastroenterologists, who are affiliated with the nearby Mount Sinai, Lenox Hill and New York Presbyterian hospitals. To date, the clinic has not been the subject of any complaints or violations. According to the clinic's website, there are five state-of-the-art procedure rooms and ambulatory surgical services. Clinic spokeswoman Tisha Kresler told MailOnline that HIPAA laws prevented staff from disclosing any information about patients. But the clinic issued a statement after Rivers died saying: 'In the event of an adverse incident, Yorkville Endoscopy would promptly report to appropriate government and regulatory agencies and would proactively co-operate with any government review.' Any investigation will also include any liability or medical release forms the star signed before the procedure. RIvers, who first came to prominence in the 1960s was pictured in fine form on stage in New York the night before her admission to Yorkville Endoscopy and was due to perform again in New Jersey the day later. Her funeral was held on Sunday and was attended by a raft of New York and Hollywood celebrities including Barbara Walters, Whoopi Goldberg and Hugh Jackman.","Announcement follows claims Rivers' personal doctor performed a surprise biopsy on her vocal cords at the Manhattan clinic last month .

"Condemned: Willie Trottie, 45, was put to death in Texas Wednesday for killing his common-law wife Barbara Canada and her brother Titus Canada . A Texas death row inmate convicted of killing his former common-law wife and her brother more than two decades ago in Houston was executed by lethal injection Wednesday evening. Willie Trottie's death sentence was carried out about 90 minutes after the U.S. Supreme Court rejected his last-day appeals. He had contended he had poor legal help at his trial and questioned the potency of the execution drug. Trottie repeatedly expressed love to witnesses - both people he selected and relatives of his victims, Barbara and Titus Canada - and several times asked for forgiveness as he was about to be executed. ‘I love you all,’ he said. ‘I'm going home, going to be with the Lord. ... Find it in your hearts to forgive me. I'm sorry.’ As the lethal dose of the powerful sedative pentobarbital kicked in, he closed his eyes and breathed quietly. After about eight breaths, he opened his mouth to exhale, then closed it. There was no further movement. Trottie, 45, was pronounced dead at 6.35pm central standard time - 22 minutes after the injection began. Since Texas has struck down the tradition of offering death row inmates special meals before execution, Trottie had the same dinner as everyone else in his unit: baked chicken, green beans, mashed potatoes, bread, and a choice of tea, punch, or water. His was the eighth lethal injection this year in Texas, and the first in the nation's most active death penalty state since recent executions went awry in Oklahoma and Arizona. Unlike those states, where a drug combination is used for capital punishment, Texas uses a single lethal dose of pentobarbital. He became the second death row inmate executed in the U.S. on Wednesday. Earl Ringo Jr. received a lethal injection just after midnight in Missouri for a 1998 robbery and double murder. After Trottie's execution, relatives of his victims released a statement saying they were relieved justice was ‘finally served all these years later.’ Scroll down for video . Failed effort: Trottie's death sentence was carried out about 90 minutes after the U.S. Supreme Court rejected his last-day appeals . Mechanism of death: It took Trottie 22 minutes to die from the moment he was injected with a lethal dose of pentobarbital . ‘It's time for our family to end this chapter and be able to move on,’ the statement read. Trottie had acknowledged shooting Barbara Canada, 24, and her brother, Titus Canada, 28, at their parents' home in Houston. But Trottie said the May 1993 shootings were accidental and in self-defense, and not worthy of a death sentence. Prosecutors said he had threatened to kill Canada, who had a protective order against him, if she didn't return to him. They said he carried out that threat when barging into the house and opening fire. Trottie's attorneys had argued to the Supreme Court that lawyers at his 1993 trial were deficient for not addressing his self-defense theory and for failing to produce sufficient testimony about Trottie's abusive childhood with an alcoholic mother. State attorneys scoffed at the argument, saying Trottie's self-defense claim was absurd and had been rejected in earlier appeals. First to go: Trottie became the second death row inmate executed in the U.S. Wednesday after Earl Ringo Jr. received a lethal injection in Missouri just after midnight . Trottie's attorneys also contended the dose of pentobarbital for his lethal injection was past its effectiveness date and could subject him to unconstitutional ‘tortuous’ pain. The state responded that the drug doesn't expire until the end of the month and that tests showed proper potency. They argued the appeal seeking details of the drug was merely another attempt to force prison officials to disclose the compounding pharmacy that provides the execution drugs, something the courts repeatedly have refused to order. Investigators have said that Trottie called his 24-year-old ex-wife May 3, 1993, and renewed an earlier death threat. They said he then showed up at her parents' house and opened fire with a semi-automatic pistol. Titus Canada, 29, also had a gun and wounded Trottie, who then cornered his ex-wife in a bedroom and shot her 11 times before returning to the wounded brother and shooting him twice execution style in the back of the head as at least two young children watched, according to investigators. Trottie drove himself to a hospital, where police arrested him.","Willie Trottie, 45, drew his last breath just before 6.35pm CDT - 22 minutes after lethal injection began .

"New Zealand police have charged Michael Harris (pictured) with dozens of sex abuse charges. Harris is pictured during his court appearance in Kaitaia, New Zealand today . Police in New Zealand are appealing to young British men who stayed at a backpackers’ lodge and suspect ‘something happened to them there’ to come forward with their stories. The appeal went out today to British and other male overseas travellers after a 56-year-old New Zealand man who ran the backpackers’ lodge appeared in court on dozens of indecent assault charges involving 16 young men who were said to have been drugged. But police said they suspect that Michael Harris allegedly assaulted many other young men, mostly overseas tourists aged between 18 and 25, who stayed at the Main Street Lodge in the small town of Kaitaia on the northern tip of the North Island. Harris, who appeared in the Kaitaia District Court today, was charged with almost 40 offences, including aggravated wounding related to allegedly drugging his victims to facilitate indecent assault and making intimate visual recordings. He was also charged of possession of intimate visual recordings and indecent assault and was remanded in custody to appear at the court again on September 18. The New Zealand Herald reported that police said many of the victims are believed to have stayed temporarily in the main dwelling of the Main Street Lodge over the past two and a half years. The premises offers general backpacking facilities, hotel units and, on occasions, longer term accommodation in the owner’s residence. The town of Kaitaia has a population of population 5,100. Asking backpackers to come forward, police said they were continuing their investigations. Detective Senior Sergeant Rhys Johnson said: ‘It is very important for us to speak to anybody who has stayed in the owner’s residence over the last two and a half years. ‘These victims are unlikely to know that something has happened to them, although they may have suspicions. The Main Street Lodge in Kaitaia, New Zealand, which is owned by Harris and where police allege he drugged his backpacker victims . ‘We will deal sensitively with them and offer all appropriate support required. ‘This is an ongoing investigation and we have a lot of work ahead to assess evidence and establish if there are further victims we are not yet aware of.’ To help potential victims contact the investigation team, police have set up an email address. Backpackers who believe they might have been indecently assaulted are asked to contact this email address: operations@police.govt.nz .

"A history of London in maps - from Shakespeare's birth to today - reveals the capital's changing landscape over 450 years and how many were designed to show what the population ate or if they were 'vicious criminals' rather than helping people find their way. The new exhibition, 'Mapping London', contains the oldest existing original map of London from 1572,  designed with bright colours and a boat-filled Thames to 'uplift the spirit' of armchair travellers rather than help give directions. One from 1655 says it 'is a ready helpe or Guide to direct Countrey-men and Strangers to finde the nearest way from one place to another' and renamed streets like Bow Street in central London 'Theeving Lane' because of its high density of pickpockets. Scroll down for video . 1572: This magnificent plan, believed to be the oldest original of London in existence, was published by Braun and Hogenberg. In it London is depicted in birds-eye view from the south looking north. Four figures in traditional Tudor dress alongside Latin that says the capital is 'famed amongst many peoples for its commerce, adorned with houses and churches, distinguished by fortifications, famed for men of all arts and sciences, and lastly for its wealth in all things' 1799: Richard Horwood's map was produced for use by the Phoenix Fire Office, an insurance firm.  It was the largest map ever printed in Britain at the time, and the first attempt to produce a map of London with all of the houses delineated and numbered. It was plotted to show which buildings had the greatest fire risk . 1922: MacDonald Gill's large London Underground map says:  'In the heat of the summer we will find me cool, in the cool of the winter will find me warm, come down underground you've bought you your ticket ? Your health man I'm thinking no longer twill stick it. For cheapness, celerity what else can compare. You are fed up above, feed below on our fare'. The coats of Arms are of the eight principal London Boroughs and a rabbit for London Underground, which he joke was the oldest Tube inhabitant . 2012: For this work Simon Walter has painstakingly charted the buried rivers, Tube lines, bunkers, sewers, government tunnels and other subterranean secrets of London. The work also includes mysterious and underworld elements, such as unsolved murders, ley lines and pagan burial sites . In 1719 one map says London has 5,000 streets, 110,000 houses and the population is guessed at 'by what is eaten' by almost 700,000 'souls'. A 1799 masterpiece drawn by Richard Horwood was the final attempt to map every building in London. It was paid for by insurers who wanted to know which homes and businesses were near candle makers or tanneries so they could increase premiums because of the fire threat. An 1899 map is coloured by by street and its key says: 'The Lowest Class. Vicious, semi-criminal' (black); 'Very Poor, casual. Chronic Want' (blue); 'Poor. 18s to 21s a week for a moderate family' (light blue); 'Mixed. Some comfortable, others poor' (purple); 'Fairly Comfortable. Good ordinary earnings' (pink); 'Well-to-do. Middle class' (red); 'Upper-middle and Upper classes. Wealthy' (yellow). At the centre of all the maps is the Thames, whose snaking path proved incredibly difficult to plot accurately and is different on every one of the older exhibits. 'Mapping London' is part of the Totally Thames Festival and also has spectacular maps from the present day, including Stephen Walter's 2012 creation 'Subterranea', showing the sewers, tubes, underground rivers and burial grounds that lie under the city. The exhibition is curated by Daniel Crouch, one of the world's leading specialist map dealers, who also owns the first map of the Americas, the world's first colour atlas printed in colour and the first map ever printed, from 1475. He found fame in 2007 after he sold an atlas in his collection for £2.1million and days later sold a map for $1million. 1655: Thomas Porter named this: 'The Newest and Exactest Mapp of the most Famous Citties London and Westminster with their Suburbs', and said it was designed to 'helpe or Guide to direct Countrey-men and Strangers to finde the nearest way from one place to another' 1746: Considered one of the finest maps of - what is now - Greater London John Rocque, a French Huguenot who emigrated with the rest of his family to London in the 1730s, took nine years to produce it and had it engraved upon 24 sheets of copper before it could be published in 1746 . 1812: Edward Langley and William Belche's map features the new and grand building and bridges of London, including the new docks of east London where Canary Wharf now stands. Areas due for development like Tavistock Square are coloured but blank as they were being built . 1827: Christopher and John Greenwood's map is considered to be of Ordinance Survey standard. It is scaled at 8ins per mile and has detailed depictions of streets, houses, public buildings, parks, squares, woods, plantations, rivers, hills, windmills and boundaries. Below the plan is a dedication to George IV, which is flanked by views of Westminster Abbey and St Paul's Cathedral . 1843: George Frederick Cruchley (1796-1880) was a publisher of ;some of the clearest and most attractive London maps'. This shows the expanding London and extends north to south from Highgate to Dulwich, and west to east from Hammersmith to Greenwich. Cruchley would re-issue the plan several times for the following 20 years, each time updating it with the latest additions.

"She is due to give birth in just a few weeks. But there is no slowing down for Chelsea Clinton. Despite quitting her $26,000-a-minute reporting job at NBC last month to focus on her baby, the 34-year-old was seen pounding the streets of New York yesterday looking serious in a business-like shirt and blazer. Scroll down fro video . Looking swell! Chelsea Clinton sported a huge baby bump as she ran errands in New York yesterday . Not long now: She is due to give months in a few weeks but will work for the Clinton Foundation until then . She spoke animatedly on the phone between errands as she continues to organize events for the Clinton Foundation. Bill and Hillary's daughter announced that she was pregnant with her investment banker husband Marc Mezvinsky in April. Her growing baby bump means her mother's bid for presidency could soon become a reality. Hillary Clinton vowed to postpone running for the nomination until she became a grandmother. So heavily-pregnant Chelsea will have been a welcome sight to supporters of a second Clinton administration. She had been working sporadically at the network since 2011 after winning a reported $600,000-a-year contract to report on stories featuring people or organizations doing public-spirited work. Chic: Chelsea was not about to let go of her sleek look despite being very far into her pregnancy . Taking it easy? The former first daughter quit her $26,000-a-minute job at NBC last month to focus on her baby . Just the ticket: Her growing baby bump will have been a welcome sight to voters backing Hillary Clinton for the Democrat nomination. Chelsea's mother vowed to postpone her bid until after she had become a grandmother . The network confirmed her exit on last month. She was initially hired to do stories for Brian Williams' 'Rock Center' news magazine but that program was canceled. Her work occasionally appeared on NBC's Nightly News. Politico magazine reported earlier this year that NBC was paying Clinton $600,000 annually before it was scaled back to a month-to-month deal in January. Her last piece for the network aired on August 1. Politic reported on Friday that Clinton's salary had worked out at an estimated $26,000 for each minute she appeared on air. Clinton and husband Marc, 36, celebrated their fourth-wedding anniversary at the end of last month. They were married in a lavish inter-faith ceremony in Rhinebeck, New York on July 31, 2010. Ready to go: The 34-year-old and her banker husband will likely raise the child in Gramercy, New York City . Peacemaker: The pregnancy seemed to be a bonding topic for Chelsea's father Bill and rival George W. Bush . Advice: Bush warned Clinton he will soon be much further down in the family pecking order after the birth . Side stage: Hillary, here watched her husband and Bush talk, has refused to push her nomination until the birth . The couple live in a $10.5million condo in the Gramercy area of Manhattan. Alex Wallace, senior vice president at NBC News, praised Clinton today and didn't rule out working with her in the future. She told People: 'Chelsea's storytelling inspired people across the country and showcased the real power we have as individuals to make a difference in our communities. 'While she will be missed, we look forward to working with her in the future.' Her exit removes some potential awkwardness for the network if her mother runs for president in 2016. The birth also seems to have settled awkward relations between her father and his former political rival George W. Bush. Appearing together to unveil a new Presidential Leadership Scholars program, the pair laughed and joked about being grandfathers. Bush warned Clinton: 'Get ready ... to be like the lowest person in the pecking order in your family.'","Former first daughter appeared making business calls with growing bump .

"A culture of heavy drinking has led to sexual molestation becoming the norm on a night out for young women – and they feel they have to put up with it, an academic report warns today. In a disturbing insight into how 18 to 24-year-olds behave on a night out, a survey has found one in three girls received inappropriate or unwanted physical attention or groping, but few were surprised. Academics said that excessive consumption of alcohol has turned Britain’s pubs and clubs into a ‘permissive social arena’. Scroll down for video . Academics said that excessive consumption of alcohol has turned Britain’s pubs and clubs into a ‘permissive social arena’ (file picture) The report comes nine years after Labour controversially relaxed Britain’s licensing laws to allow 24-hour drinking. Police, judges, health workers and a Daily Mail campaign all warned the policy would prove to be a disaster. The findings are revealed in a report for the charity Drinkaware, which is urging women to stop tolerating behaviour which would be considered unacceptable when sober. ICM researchers found that 31 per cent of young women said they were touched inappropriately on a drunken night out. But only 19 per cent said they were surprised by it. In addition, more than a quarter (27 per cent) have put up with inappropriate sexual comments or abuse on a drunken night out. Young men are not exempt –with one in ten saying they had to deal with unwanted physical attention or groping. Researchers who interviewed and surveyed just over 2,000 young people pointed to a culture of heavy drinking, in which large amounts of alcohol are consumed before youngsters even leave the house. Many young people believe they cannot venture out to bars at night unless they have been drinking first. The report, written by the academics Simon Christmas and Fiona Seymour, warns: ‘The drunken night out provides an arena within which much more extreme social interactions are permitted. ‘A lack of clear boundaries means that people may easily be caught up in interactions which go further than they wish – or in which they do not wish to participate at all. ‘In particular, problems can arise around sexual behaviour, with molestation appearing to be a common and, to some extent, accepted part of a drunken night out. ‘Low-level sexual molestation in particular appears to be becoming a norm. Young women reported putting up with it as part of the culture of drunken nights out yet also say they find it unpleasant. ‘Rebuffed sexual advances can also lead to violence: young men who are rebuffed in an approach are particularly likely to attack male friends of the woman who rebuffed them, or more generally start looking for a fight.’ The researchers found alcohol is commonly being consumed just to get drunk, rather than for pleasure, as youngsters work out the cheapest way of becoming inebriated. The report says: ‘Alcoholic drinks are treated as ethanol-delivery mechanisms, with calculations of “units per pence” and appropriate concentrations guiding choice of drink. There is social pressure to be as drunk as everyone else.’ Chief constable Adrian Lee, who speaks for the Association of Chief Police Officers on alcohol, said: ‘The consequences of excessive drinking are witnessed across the country in the hospitals and police stations of our towns and cities every week.’","Excessive drinking has turned pubs and clubs into a 'permissive social arena .

"This teenage girl has fulfilled an amphibious ambition after becoming Britain's first professional mermaid. Emily Keat, 19, from Wadebridge, Cornwall, built her own 6 ft tail and trained for four hours a day to turn herself into a full-time half-woman half-fish performer. The former model now specialises in so-called mer-modelling, mer-acting and performing other related mer-entertainment. Cornish Emily Keat, 19, pictured at Harlyn bay near Padstow in Cornwall, is Britain's first professional mermaid . She created the scaly outfit by laboriously stitching together old . swimsuits to create a glittery skirt and fin - and has even died her hair red . to resemble her idol Ariel, The Little Mermaid. After leaving college she launched herself as a professional mermaid and makes a living from children's parties, modelling and special events such as promoting clean beaches. Emily said: 'I absolutely love being a mermaid - I couldn't imagine doing anything else. 'I watched videos and looked at pictures, and was amazed at how realistic and graceful they are. 'I have always being interested in mythical creatures. When I was younger I wanted to be a fairy. Emily makes a living as a mermaid by mer-modelling, mer-acting and other related mer-entertainment . Emily has already had several modelling jobs and children's parties, but is looking to expand her repertoire . 'But making a fairy costume didn't seem practical. I could make some wings that looked really lifelike but they would never be able to fly. 'With a mermaid tail I would actually be able to swim like a mermaid. 'I wasn't sure it would work in the water. But once I had made it I tried it out and was amazed at how well it worked.' Emily used her arts and crafts skills to sow together Lycra swimsuits sealed them with silicone bonding to make her tail. The DIY tail worked perfectly and she . spent the summer learning to dive, swim and hold her breath underwater . to emulate Disney's Ariel. Emily said she grew up obsessed with fantasy creatures and fairies but decided against becoming a Tinkerbell impersonator - because she wouldn't be able to fly. The teen, who recently completed a foundation degree at Truro and Penwith College, said: 'Swimming in the tail takes time to master and it can feel like you're sinking at times - but it's faster and I'm becoming better and better at it. 'Ultimately I want to raise awareness of keeping the seas clean and safe for marine animals. I want to use this as a platform for doing good. 'I want to educate children about sea pollution in a way that's fun so they will enjoy it and learn at the same time.' Emily's biggest inspiration was Mermaid Melissa, a famous aquatic performer from the US who glides through the water thanks to a bespoke £3,500 tail.

"A mother-of-three  infected with HIV by a boyfriend who hid his diagnosis from her says her life has been ruined by the attack which has condemned her to 'a life sentence of misery'. Kara Wilkinson, 42, began a relationship with undertaker Alan Mason, 45, in 2010 without realising he had been diagnosed as HIV positive two years earlier. Mason only revealed he had the illness in October 2011, 18 months after the pair began dating, when Miss Wilkinson became ill following a holiday to Spain. Since being diagnosed Miss Wilkinson, a . former counsellor from Barrow-in-Furness, Cumbria, has suffered . from heart attacks, pneumonia, osteoporosis and severe hair loss. Scroll down for video . Kara Wilkinson, 42 (pictured left in 2009, and right today), says she has suffered four heart attacks, pneumonia, osteoporosis and severe hair loss since she was infected with HIV . Today Mason starts serving two years and . eight months behind bars for grievous bodily harm, but Miss Wilkinson . says she has blasted the sentence for being too lenient. She said: 'He’s ruined my life. I’ll never forgive him for what he’s done. 'He should have been sent to prison for five years. And what’s to stop him doing it to another woman when he gets out?. He’s given me a life sentence of misery. 'Before I had HIV, I was never ill and had loads of energy. Now I seem to be permanently ill. My long blonde hair has started to fall out and I look much older than I am. Alan Mason, 45, was diagnosed with HIV in 2008 but didn't tell Miss Wilkinson about his diagnosis when they began dating in April 2010 . 'I don’t even have a mirror in my house as I can’t stand to look at my reflection. 'He’s taken my life away. I won’t ever forgive him for what he’s done to me. What he’s given me will never go away. 'I don’t think I’ll ever have another relationship - how could I ever trust another man? And, unlike Alan, I’d hate to put anyone else at risk from catching HIV.' Miss Wilkinson met Mason in April 2010 at a pub in Kendal. The single mum had been on her own for two years and the couple swapped numbers before going on a first date at a crazy golf course. Two months later Alan moved from his parents' house into Miss Wilkinson's rented maisonette. But during a two-week holiday in Benidorm, 18 months after they met, she started to feel unwell. Back in the UK, in October 2011, she made an appointment with her doctor, who suggested that she might be HIV positive. 'At the beginning of the second week away, I woke up feeling sick, had diarrhoea and felt weak and dizzy when I stood up,' she said. 'When the doctor said I might be HIV positive, it didn’t make any sense. I told her that I was in a long term relationship but agreed to have a blood test taken just in case. 'When I got home, I told Alan what the doctor had said. He just shrugged, but the next day, he told me he had something important to say. 'He dropped the bombshell that he thought I was HIV positive, as he’d had the same symptoms for years before. I couldn’t believe what I was hearing. My first thought was, ""I’m going to die.""' Miss Wilkinson (pictured left in July 2010) says she now has to take daily medication to keep the HIV from developing into AIDS, and to prevent more heart attacks . Miss Wilkinson says she first felt ill in October 2011 after going on holiday with Mason to Benidorm (pictured). It was only after doctors tested her for HIV that Mason confessed to what he had done . As she had been sterilised after having three children from a previous relationship, the couple hadn’t used protection through their relationship, and often had sex every day. After having the diagnosis confirmed, Miss Wilkinson quizzed her boyfriend on where he’d caught the virus, how it affected him and why he hadn’t told her he was infected before they slept together. 'All he could tell me was he’d caught it after a one night stand with a girl and that he hadn’t told me because he didn’t want to lose me,' she said. 'He’d even stopped taking his medication when we moved in together so that I wouldn’t get suspicious. He told me that it wouldn’t make any difference to my life, as long as I took the medicine. 'Eventually after my questions, he snapped and accused me of being selfish for talking about HIV so much. I couldn’t believe what I was hearing, so I kicked him out.' Miss . Wilkinson said Mason has 'ruined her life', adding that she will never . have another relationship because she is unable to trust men and is . frightened of giving someone else HIV . Miss Wilkinson began dating Mason (pictured together) in April 2010 after the pair met at a pub in Kendal and went on a date to a crazy golf course . Since her diagnosis, 5ft tall Miss Wilkinson has struggled to keep her weight up, dropping to 5st 7lb at one point. She was forced to quit her job and in June 2012, she started to suffer chest pain and was rushed by air ambulance to hospital in Blackpool, where she was treated for a heart attack. She added: 'I couldn’t understand why I’d had a heart attack at my age, but the doctor explained that having HIV meant I was more susceptible to heart attacks and strokes. 'Since then I’ve had four heart attacks and had two shunts fitted to open up the arteries in my heart.' Miss Wilkinson has been treated in hospital for pneumonia and has recently been diagnosed with osteoporosis. She now takes a clutch of tablets every day, to keep the AIDs infection at bay, and she prevent another heart attack. Mason, a divorced father-of-two appeared in Carlisle Crown Court on September 1, 2014, where he admitted causing Miss Wilkinson grievous bodily harm by giving her HIV.

"President Obama is poised to launch new airstrikes against ISIS in Syria as part of an effort to  'degrade' the militant group terrorizing the Middle East. Obama is expected announce plans this evening to go on the offense against ISIS by expanding airstrikes to include targets beyond those necessary to protect Americans and support Iraqi forces. The broader air strike campaign will ramp up gradually, CBS News reports, and will focus on helping Iraqis retake their country from the violent extremist group. The news organization said the president also plans to deploy more troops to Iraq. It was not immediately clear how many more forces Obama would send in and what role they would play. Scroll down for video . Plans: President Obama, was pictured, right, discussing his plans to beat ISIS wth House Speaker John Boehner, left . Baghdad bound: U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry reads on a flight en route to Iraq on Wednesday on a visit to the Middle East to discuss ways to bolster the stability of the new Iraqi government and combat ISIS . Talks: Kerry will urge newly-installed Haider al-Abadi to unite the rival factions in his country - as well as offering U.S. help to tackle ISIS . Obama is preparing for a prime-time televised speech in which he will spell out a long-awaited strategy to confront ISIS, a brutal terror network that has captured huge swathes of Iraq and Syria and published depraved videos showing its fighters beheading American journalists. The United States military has already launched targeted strikes against the group's positions in Iraq, but has yet to strike at their strongholds in Syria, where the extremists are also fighting soldiers from the regime of Syrian president Bashar al-Assad. Obama told congressional leaders on Tuesday that he has the authority he needs to broaden his military campaign into Syria, striking ISIS in its stronghold despite objections from Assad. A source familiar with the president's plans told CBS News on Wednesday that Obama would 'eventually' strike Syria, but analysts have not finished identifying targets there. Among the announcements Obama will make Wednesday is the authorization of new counterterrorism efforts. He also plans to pledge American troops to training and equipping moderate elements of the Assad's Islamist opposition.` Hours before Obama met with senior Capitol Hill leaders, former Vice President Dick Cheney told House GOP stalwarts in the National Republican Congressional Committee that they need to stand strong in the age of ISIS against the Obama administration's efforts to pare back military spending. Cheney reportedly blamed Obama's isolationist tendencies forcefully for the rise of Middle Eastern Islamist extremism, particularly ISIS's rush to fill a power vacuum left when Obama pulled U.S. troops out of Iraq. The Washington Examiner reported that a meeting attendee said Cheney warned 'how unprepared the U.S. military is for any kind of medium- or large-scale engagement against ISIS because the administration is cutting the military so much.' As the pendulum swings back toward more military action in Iraq, a senior administration official confirmed to The New York Times.that fresh airstrikes will be a prominent feature of Obama's nascent strategy. The package could also include a $500 million fund to arm Syrian rebels groups in their fight against ISIS, which was suggested earlier this year but has yet to be approved. The impending new plans come as John Kerry, the U.S. Secretary of State, arrives in Baghdad to meet with the new Iraqi prime minister. Kerry will urge newly-installed Haider al-Abadi to unite the rival factions in his country - as well as offering U.S. help to tackle ISIS. In his 9:00 p.m. address, Obama will challenge Congress to quickly give him authority to arm moderate Syrian opposition forces fighting Assad. But administration officials said he will press forward with other elements of his plan without formal authorization from lawmakers. Those include increased support for Iraqi security forces, as well as military and diplomatic commitments from partners in Europe, the Middle East and elsewhere. Obama sent a memorandum to Kerry on Wednesday afternoon directing him to set aside $25 million for 'immediate military assistance' for the Iraqi government and Kurdish forces. Vision: Kerry looks out over Baghdad from a helicopter ahead of his arrival for the crucial meetings . Weight of the world: Kerry arrived in Baghdad as Obama prepares to make his prime time speech that will set out his plan on how to respond to the threat posed by ISIS . Political solution: Kerry listens as new Iraqi Prime Minister Haider Abadi. The Obama administration has said that ISIS will not be defeated by military action alone. Kerry said after the meeting he was impressed by the premier's plans to rebuild the Iraqi military and push broad political reforms . After an hour of discussion with congressional leaders yesterday, Obama told lawmakers that he 'has the authority he needs to take action' against ISIS. The White House added that the president still would welcome action from Congress that would 'aid the overall effort and demonstrate to the world that the United States is united in defeating the threat.' Among the president's most urgent priorities will be seeking authorization from Congress to arm more moderate elements of the Syrian opposition fighting Assad. The president asked lawmakers earlier this year for a $500 million train-and-equip program, but the plan stalled on Capitol Hill. Nearly five in 10 Americans believe that the country is less safe now than it was before 9/11, a new poll shows. Americans who are worried about security threats far outnumber those who think that the United States is more safe than it was after the nation attacked by Al Qaeda or just as safe. The NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll found that 47 percent of Americans said they felt less safe than before compared to the 26 percent who said they felt more safe. Another 26 percent reported no change in the perception of their safety. A majority, 61 percent, also expressed support for military action against Islamic extremists in Iraq and Syria who some lawmakers believe may be targeting the U.S. for an attack. Obama and Biden spent Wednesday afternoon calling lawmakers to make a last-minute plea for them to add the measure to a continuing resolution to keep the government open that they intend to debate on Thursday. House Appropriations Committee Chairman Hal Rogers, who was one of the members on the receiving end of a call from the president, said he wasn't in favor of introducing a new element into the government funding debate so late in the process. 'They've known about this problem for over a year,' Rogers told The Hill. 'It's a complicated, big-time change in policy... Let us go ahead with a CR to keep the government going.' Still, House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy said Wednesday that the legislative body would postpone a vote on the resolution until next week. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi argued that authorization for the military effort should be 'on whatever engine is leaving the station, and that's one that is leaving the station.' That's for sure a must-pass bill in a [short window] of time, and I would hope that it would be on there,' she said on Wednesday. The U.S. is already running a small-scaled CIA scheme to train rebels, but Obama is hoping for approval for a more overt military effort that could involve staging training locations in countries near Syria. With Obama ruling out sending U.S. ground troops into combat in Iraq or Syria, bolstering the capacity of the Iraqi security forces and Syrian opposition will be crucial to efforts to root out the Islamic State militant group. Administration officials said Obama also sees a congressional approval for a the training scheme as a way to send a strong signal to allies considering similar efforts. Secretary of State John Kerry traveled to the Middle East on Wednesday for discussions in Saudi Arabia and Jordan. On Capitol Hill, there was little consensus on the scope of Obama's authority to broaden the campaign against the Islamic State extremists. While some lawmakers said the president has the power he needs under the Constitution, others were seeking a more central congressional role in the effort. Warmongers: ISIS has seized huge amounts of territory in Iraq and Syria. They are pictured above in a position won from the Iraqi government's army . 'I think it is to his advantage and the country's advantage to have Congress buy into that,' Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said before joining other Republican and Democratic leaders in the Oval Office on Tuesday for a meeting with Obama. None of the leaders spoke to reporters as they left the White House. However, an aide to House Speaker John Boehner said the Ohio Republican expressed support for efforts to increase the effectiveness of the Iraqi security forces and for equipping the Syrian opposition. Boehner also said he would support the deployment of U.S. military personnel to Iraq in a training and advisory role and to 'assist with lethal targeting' of ISIS, according to the aide, who spoke only on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the private meeting by name. The U.S. is already launching airstrikes against Islamic State targets inside Iraq, a mission undertaken at the invitation of the Iraqi government and without formal authorization from Congress. But the scope of the mission has been limited to strikes that help protect American interests in the region and prevent humanitarian crises. U.S. officials said Obama was expected to loosen those limitations and open a broader counterterrorism campaign against the militants in Iraq. Following the Islamic State group's shocking beheading of two American journalists in Syria, Obama began more seriously considering extending strikes into that country. People who have spoken with Obama in recent days said it appeared likely he would take that step. At a private dinner Monday with foreign policy experts, Obama emphasized the importance of viewing the Islamic State as one organisation, not two groups separated by a border. Fighters: Pictured above are members of the Kurdish Peshmerga military fighting ISIS . Obama's spokesman has said the president is willing 'to go wherever is necessary to strike those who are threatening Americans.' However, Obama has continued to rule out sending U.S. troops into ground combat operations in the Middle East. Unlike in Iraq, Obama would not be acting at the invitation of a host government. However, some international law experts say airstrikes could be justified as a matter of self-defense if Obama argues the Islamic State group poses a threat to the U.S. and its allies from inside Syria, whose government is unwilling or unable to stop it.","Air Force has hit ISIS targets in Iraq – but has not yet struck Syria .

"Police in New Zealand are appealing to overseas tourists - possibly including Australians - who stayed at a backpackers’ lodge and suspect 'something happened to them there' to come forward with their stories. The appeal went out on Wednesday to British and other male overseas travellers after a 56-year-old New Zealand man who ran the backpackers' lodge appeared in court on dozens of indecent assault charges involving 16 young men who were said to have been drugged. But police said they suspect Michael Harris allegedly assaulted many other young men, mostly overseas tourists aged between 18 and 25, who stayed at the Main Street Lodge over the past two and a half years in the small town of Kaitaia - which has a population of 5,100 - on the northern tip of the North Island. It is alleged Michael Harris allegedly assaulted 16 male backpackers in a lodge he owned in Kaitaia on New Zealand's North Island . Harris, who appeared in the Kaitaia District Court on Wednesday, was charged with almost 40 offences, including aggravated wounding related to allegedly drugging his victims to facilitate indecent assault and making intimate visual recordings. He was also charged of possession of intimate visual recordings and indecent assault and was remanded in custody to appear at the court again on September 18. The New Zealand Herald reported police said many of the victims are believed to have stayed temporarily in the main dwelling of the Main Street Lodge over the past two and a half years. The premises offers general backpacking facilities, hotel units and, on occasions, longer term accommodation in the owner’s residence. Asking backpackers to come forward, police said they were continuing their investigations. ‘It is very important for us to speak to anybody who has stayed in the owner’s residence over the last two and a half years,’ said Detective Senior Sergeant Rhys Johnson. ‘These victims are unlikely to know that something has happened to them, although they may have suspicions,’ the Herald quoted him as saying. Victims are believed to have stayed temporarily in the main dwelling of the Main Street Lodge over the past two and a half years . Police allege the 54-year-old drugged the men from overseas countries - possibly including those from Australia . ‘We will deal sensitively with them and offer all appropriate support required. ‘This is an ongoing investigation and we have a lot of work ahead to assess evidence and establish if there are further victims we are not yet aware of.’ To help potential victims contact the investigation team, police have set up an email address.

"A frustrated Michael Moore, the liberal filmmaker who led cheers for Barack Obama before he ascended to the White House, said Tuesday that he would only be remembered as America's first black president – 'and that's it.' Obama, he said during an interview at the Toronto Film Festival, has become a 'huge disappointment' by failing to bail out ailing cities like his hometown of Detroit. Michigan. “When you start turning the water off in 150,000 homes because they haven’t paid the water bill?' he asked. 'You have that many people without water? You start turning the streetlights off so the city is dark at night? A large American city in pitch blackness?' 'Is this some sort of social experiment? – they're trying to see, ""How far you can push the poor?""' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Not so big on Obama: Michael Moore slammed the president through a TV camera, saying his failures would ensure he is remembered as America's first black occupant of the Oval Office . Man of the people: Moore has cultivated a homespun image while amassing millions from his rabble-rouding documentary films . 'Detroit at this point would stand a better chance if they were an Iraqi or Syrian city,' he claimed, 'in terms of getting some sort of help.' Turning to the Hollywood Reporter's camera, he addressed the president directly. 'When the history is written of this era,' Moore said, 'this is how you’ll be remembered: ""He was the first black president."" Okay, not a bad accomplishment, but that's it. That's it, Mr. Obama.' 'A hundred years from now: ""He was the first black American that got elected president."" And that's it. Eight years of your life and that’s what people are going to remember.' 'Boy, I got a feeling, knowing you,' the filmmaker scolded, 'that you'd probably wish you were remembered for a few other things, a few other things you could have done.' 'So, it is, on that level, a big disappointment.' Moore has come out swinging against Obama before. In 2011, upset about the president's military campaign in Libya, he tore into the chief executive on Twitter. 'May I suggest a 50-mile evacuation zone around Obama's Nobel Peace Prize? #returnspolicy,' Moore tweeted. Finincially unraveling Detroit, Moore snarked, would be better off if it were in Syria or Iraq because Obama would be paying attention to its inhabitants . Around the same time, he told the BBC that Obama's first term in office had been 'heartbreaking' for liberals. 'He did not come into office like I had hoped that he would,' Moore said then, 'to do what [President] Franklin Roosevelt did in his first few months, where he came in and said, you know, ""I'm in charge, this is the way we're doing things, if you don’t like it, throw me out of office"".' Moore was in Toronto for a 25th-anniversary screening of his first film, 'Roger & Me,' which focused on General Motors' CEO at the time, Roger Smith, whom he accused of raiding jobs and functionally destroying the Michigan town of Flint. His other controversy-laden movies include Bowling for Columbine, Fahrenheit 9/11 and Capitalism: A Love Story.","Angry left-wing filmmaker trashed Democratic president in Toronto as 'a big disappointment'

"Groups of vigilantes armed with guns, handcuffs and bulletproof vests are patrolling the Texas state border with Mexico in a radical new attempt to keep migrants from crossing the Rio Grande. Since early summer a group naming themselves the Patriots have patrolled an area near Brownsville, Texas. One 25-year-old member, who only gave the name Will, patrols the area each day carrying binoculars, an assault rifle and a Glock pistol. A sign erected to deter trespassers hangs in the front yard of Fernando Rivera Jr's house in Brownsville, Texas . A U.S. Border Patrol vehicle drives past the 18ft-high steel fence that stretches hundreds of miles along the Texas and Mexico border . A patch stating 'come and take it' is sewn into the bulletproof jacket worn by a member of the Patriots . The construction worker, originally from Indiana, said: 'If you spot them (the migrants) and shine your light on them, that lets them know that you're there. 'Nine times out of 10, they're not going to come over. Even if they are going to try to cross again, we're still making it harder for them, and that's the reason we're here.' The Patriots Information Hotline, a networking call center, estimates that 22 groups of 'armed patriots' have sprung up along the border from Texas to California this year. With names like Patriots and Citizen Defenders, the groups often set up camp on private land along the border at a property owner's invitation. Expenses are generally paid by members, though some funds come from like-minded donors. To critics, they are militias - vigilantes spoiling for a fight. For would-be migrants, they are another barrier to entry. A member of the Patriots, who only gave the name Ray, poses for a picture at a camp run by the vigilante border patrol group in Brownsville, Texas . For the U.S. Border Patrol, they can be either a nuisance or a help in spotting people trying to enter the country illegally. The groups insist that their presence is unrelated to the tens of thousands of children from Central America who flooded across the border with Mexico earlier this year. The Patriots claim their efforts are essential because the U.S. government has failed to secure the border. They bristle at the terms 'militia' and 'vigilante'. 'Everybody has this bad taste in their mouth about 'militias. They think we're out here trying to smoke people and kill them as soon as they cross the border. Which obviously, is not the case,' said a member who only gave the name 'Huggie Bear'. 'Our goal here is to try to deter them from coming. They see us, they don't know who we are, so that kind of scares people away for a while.' The Patriots operate on 21 acres of land owned by Rusty Monsees, whose family has had a ranch on the border since the 1940s. They patrol in body armor, riding all-terrain vehicles that drown out the sound of cicadas at night. Mr Monsees, 66, said 'illegals' have poisoned his dogs and sprayed his yellow house with bullets, but he refuses to leave. The Patriots carry plastic handcuffs to detain border crossers and communications equipment to inform Border Patrol. However, some say it is just a matter of time before one of the vigilante border patrol groups sparks a deadly firefight. Tin cut out in the shape of a pistol accompanies a sign warning the homeowner doesn't 'dial 911' hangs on the porch of Fernando Rivera Jr's home . Fernando Rivera Jr and his son Fernando Rivera III look on as a neighbour's pet raccoon jumps up at them . Eddie Guerra, sheriff of the Texas border county of Hidalgo, said: 'When there are situations with any individual who is bearing arms in public or on private property, there is always a concern amongst law enforcement of possible misidentification that can lead to friendly-fire tragedies.' Border Patrol has warned the groups that taking matters into their own hands could have 'disastrous personal and public safety consequences.' Many in Brownsville live in the shadow of an 18-foot-high rust-colored steel barrier that stretches hundreds of miles along the border. A few, including Fernando Rivera Jr., have called on groups like the Patriots to keep an eye on their properties. Patriots member Rob Chupp goes through a woman's abandoned bag on the U.S side of the Rio Grande river . 'Whoever says there's not a problem by the border wall, they don't live out here,' he said. He added that his son walks around the backyard with a shotgun slung over his back to protect the family from what he says are criminals coming across the border. In addition to the Monsees' property, the Patriots monitor homes in the area at the request of owners like Rivera, who said it can take up to 45 minutes for a county sheriff to arrive after a call for help. 'Now, when they're on patrol, it's actually peaceful,' he said. 'The dogs don't bark as much. I can actually get some sleep.'","Armed citizens form border patrol groups in attempt to stop flow of migrants .

"A man who devoted his life to retired circus elephants has been killed after being trampled by one of the mammals he loved so much. Dr. James Laurita, 56, of Hope, Maine, was found dead at the Hope Foundation, the facility he co-founded that was dedicated to caring for elephants and educating the public about these animals, earlier today. He appeared to have fallen before one of the foundation's two Asian circus elephants, Rosie and Opal, who then apparently stepped on him. Tragedy: Dr. James Lurita with one of the two elephants he spent almost his entire life caring for . 'The elephant was not aggressive in any way. It was clearly an accident,' Mark Belserene, administrator for the state medical examiner's office, told NBC. He added that the official cause of death was 'asphyxiation and multiple fractures caused by compression of the chest.' Dr. Laurita, who sold his veterinarian business in 2011 to start the Hope Foundation, lived with his family nearby. Lifelong animal lover: Dr. laurita had worked at the Bronx Zoo, as the head elephant trainer for a wildlife safari park in Oregon, and he traveled to India to work with elephants . Along with his brother Tom, Dr. Laurita had worked with the Carson & Barnes Circus in the midwest as a youngster, and it was there that the two were assigned to work with elephants. That’s when they met Rosie and Opal according to The Bangor Daily News. 'Always in the back of my mind and my brother’s mind was that we wanted to do something for these elephants,' Dr, Laurita said in a 2012 interview, adding that he and his brother had known these two elephants for 'the last 30-something years.' Before he started Hope Foundation, he had also worked at  the Bronx Zoo, as the head elephant trainer for a wildlife safari park in Oregon, and had even traveled to India to work with elephants. 'We want to make their lives more comfortable,' he once said of the majestic mammals.

"The trial of a pharmaceutical executive and socialite worth millions who purposely fed her young son an overdose of fatal drugs began today in NYC. Gigi Jordan, 54, forced a cocktail of crushed pills and booze down the throat of her 8-year-old autistic son Jude Michael Mirra in a $2,300-a-night suite at Manhattan's posh Peninsula Hotel on Feb. 4 , 2010. She then balanced her checkbook and called her financial advisor to transfer $125,000 from her son's trust into her account as he lay on the bed slowly dying next to her, the prosecution stated in their opening argument. Tragic end: Gigi Jordan (right) force-fed her son Jude Michael Mirra (left) booze and pills back in what she calls a mercy killing . Heartless killer: Lead prosecutor Matthew Bogdanos says Jordan (above, with defense lawyer Allan Brenner) had no regard for her child, and even balanced her checkbook as he lay dying next to her . Jordan has never disputed giving the fatal dose of drugs to her son, calling it a mercy killing. After forcing the pills down the boy's throat with a syringe and spending the night with his body, Jordan then attempted to take her own life by consuming  the same mixture of pills and vodka she gave her son, but was foiled when members of law enforcement kicked down the door to the room and found her on the floor incoherent and babbling. She immediately said to one officer, 'I want a lawyer.' Lead prosecutor Matthew Bogdanos scoffed at the notion of this being a mercy killing in court earlier today however, saying Jordan just wanted to live the life of the socialite and not be tied down by a young son who required so much attention with his special needs. Allegations: Jordan (above) claims her son's biological father, and her second husband, was sexually abusing him, and that her first husband wanted to murder her and her child . In fact, he believes she had no regard at all for her child and is a cold and calculated killer. 'Ms. Jordan is so distraught, so emotional, so emotionally disturbed that she balances her checkbook in that room on her bed with her dead child only a few feet away,' he told jurors. He then described the terrifying scene law enforcement officers walked in on when they found the two back in 2010, saying 'there were enough [drugs] in that room to fill a pharmacy shelf.' Murder suicide: After taking the life of her autistic son, Jordan attempted to kill herself, but was unsuccessful . Site of the crime: Jordan was found babbling and incoherent by law enforcement officers in a $2,300-a-night suite at Manhanttan's posh Peninsula Hotel . Defense attorney Allan Brenner painted a much different picture in his opening statement though, one of a caring, loving and devoted mother who was terrified of the suffering her son was going through. In addition to his medical condition, Jordan alleges that her son's biological father, and her second husband, Emil Tzekov, had been sexually abusing the boy since he was an infant. She also alleges that her first husband, Ray Mirra, had threatened to murder her and the boy if she turned him in to authorities for selling black market prescription drugs. Neither Tzekov or Mirra have ever been charged with a crime. 'She brought him the peace she couldn’t give him during his life. She protected him from the animals that she couldn’t keep from his door before then,' argued  Brenner. Brenner plans to argue that Jordan killed her son while in the grip of an extreme emotional disturbance, which would allow the jury to convict her of manslaughter rather than murder. Killing a person to save them from future abuse has never been a recognized defense to murder in the state of New York. Jordan, who according to the New York Times has gone through 11 defense lawyers since she was charged over four years ago, faces up to life in prison if convicted. The trial is expected to last until November.","The trial of Gigi Jordan began today in NYC, with prosecutors saying the mother did her finances after force-feeding her son an overdose of pills .

"Jail: Adam Matos, 28, was arrested September 5, 2014 outside a Tampa hotel as a suspect in the killings of four people whose bodies were found stacked on the ground and decomposing . The suspect in the Florida deaths of his ex-girlfriend, her new boyfriend and her parents said in a jailhouse interview that he is innocent. Adam Matos, 28, told The Tampa Bay Times he was just in the wrong place at the wrong time in an interview from the Pasco County Jail in Florida. He said: 'Everybody's looking at me like I did it. All the fingers point to me, you know? So I'm not going to change anybody's beliefs.' Matos was arrested on September 5 at a Tampa Bay area hotel with his four-year-old autistic son, Ismael Tristan Santisteban. The bodies of the child's mother, Megan Brown, her parents, Margaret and Greg Brown and her new boyfriend, Nicholas Leonard, were found on top of a hill in Pasco County. The child was missing for a day before he was found safe in Tampa with Matos. He is currently being held on a separate aggravated assault charge. The child is with family. In the interview from jail, Matos told the Times that his son is 'the sweetest kid you'll ever know.' 'I want the people to know that I didn't do it,' Matos said, 'and that I love my son very much.' He also contradicted a police report that he had threatened Megan Brown with a knife on August 28, which is the last day anyone had heard from her and said that didn't happen. Instead, he said they had an argument over 'something stupid' and she asked him to leave. He also offered up his own theory of what happened. He says a woman who possibly knew Leonard was stalking Brown. He said the woman, who he never saw and didn't know her name, had left Brown threatening letters and voicemails. He said that she was the one who had threatened Megan Brown at the family's home. Matos told The Times that he had lived on the street for a few days after the argument with Megan Brown. Arrest: SWAT teams swarmed the Floridian Hotel in Tampa on September 5 and arrested Adam Matos, pictured, but he has told a newspaper that he is innocent . Found: Ismael Tristan Santisteban was found at a Tampa hotel after going missing with his father, who was wanted for the murders of four people . Killed: The body of  Nicholas Leonard, pictured here, was found on top of a hill in Pasco County . He wouldn't say how he got the child or where he was planning to go. He said at the advice of his attorney, a public defender, he couldn't divulge more. Matos was born in Philadelphia and had lived in Allentown, Pennsylvania, and New York City. He said he met Brown six years ago and still loves her. He said he had shared responsibility of taking care of Tristan. He left Pennsylvania with Brown and her family two months ago. They settled in Hudson. He said they broke up two weeks ago, but they ended the relationship on good terms.

"A University of Montana student who disappeared over the weekend during a fishing trip was found alive on Tuesday near the state's border with Idaho where his sport utility vehicle had broken down, authorities said. Dozens of law enforcement officials and volunteers had been scouring the winding canyons and trout streams of the Bitterroot Valley in western Montana in a search for August Kramer, 21, after he failed to return to the Missoula campus as planned on Sunday. Safe and sound: August Kramer, left, was lost for two days in the Montana wilderness . Resourceful: Kramer has said that he boiled water and that he put CDs on the top of his car so that the reflection would get attention overhead . Kramer, who grew up in a suburb of St. Paul, Minnesota, was driving on Sunday on a dirt road toward Idaho from Montana to go fly fishing when his vehicle broke down, stranding him for two nights in temperatures that dipped below freezing, said Paige Pavalone, spokeswoman for the Missoula County Sheriff’s Office. Kramer revealed to NBC Montana, 'At first there was a little bit of panic where just, you know, it's just like ""Okay this is happening, I need to figure out what I am going to do next.""' To survive, Kramer also said he 'cut the top off the beer can and dumped it out and then I would go down to the stream a half mile away and then bring back water and then boil it so that it would be sanitary.' He also told NBC Montana that he 'taped a bunch of CDs upside-down to the roof of my car to try to make it more reflective, and I had my fire going all the time and a bunch of green tree branches that I was going to throw on the fire to signal aircraft or maybe a helicopter or something.' Kramer, a senior majoring in forestry, was spotted on Tuesday by an unidentified driver who picked him up. He has since returned to Missoula, Pavalone said. Flavor: Though he was stuck, Kramer has said he 'loved' eating a grasshopper . Danger: Kramer was driving on Sunday on a dirt road toward Idaho from Montana to go fly fishing when his vehicle broke down . Kramer told ABC News he 'loved' eating a grasshopper. 'There wasn’t a ton of taste, but it reminded me a little bit like popcorn,' he said. 'But not quite.' Speaking of his experience, Kramer told the news site 'When I was younger, I read a lot of survival books and some of it stuck. William Souder, who says on Facebook he is Kramer's uncle, wrote yesterday in on the page for group 'Searching for August Kramer' that 'Gus's family back in Minnesota is gathering tonight to celebrate Gus's safe return, while Gus is with his parents and his uncle in Missoula. 'We are, of course, ecstatic. The only thing that could make it better is if all of you were here with us. Thank you again everyone in Montana and elsewhere who did so much to help a family you don't even know. We owe the world a good deed.' Kramer was the second University of Montana student to go missing in recent weeks. The body of Lucius Robbi, 21, of California was found late last month in the mountains of central Idaho after disappearing on Aug. 19 while driving to the Missoula campus. Authorities said Robbi died from blunt force trauma the same day he disappeared after his car plunged down a 60-foot embankment in an accident being investigated by the Idaho State Police.","University of Montana student August Kramer was found alive on Tuesday near the state's border with Idaho .

"Three patients a week wake up from anaesthetic while they are undergoing surgey, new figures suggest. Around one patient in every 19,000 spontaneously experience the 'accidental awareness' after not being given enough general anaesthetic. But often surgeons are left completely unaware their patients are awake, because they are unable to move or make a sound. Scroll down for video . Three patients a week wake up from anaesthetic while they are undergoing surgey, new figures suggest . Every year there are around three million operations conducted in the UK where the patient is put under general anaesthesia, the Royal College of Anaesthetists (RCoA) said. This means that each year there could be as many as 158 patients whose anaesthetic fails to work properly. The College said that accidental awareness is one of the 'most feared' complications of general anaesthesia for both patients and doctors. It occurs when general anaesthesia is intended but the patient remains conscious. A new report from the RCoA and the Association of Anaesthetists of Great Britain and Ireland studied three million operations conducted in public hospitals in the UK and Ireland - including 300 reports of awareness. The authors found that some surgeries - such as cardiothoracic operations and caesarean sections - carry a higher risk than others and people who have been given muscle relaxants are also more likely to suffer this complication. Often surgeons are left completely unaware their patients are awake, because they are unable to move or make a sound . They said the majority of failures occur before surgery starts or after it finishes. But just over half of those who spontaneously reported the failure said the incident had caused them distress and around 40 per cent suffered longer-term psychological harm such as post-traumatic stress disorder, authors said. Sensations experienced when accidentally aware included tugging, stitching, pain, paralysis and choking, they found. And patients described feelings of dissociation, panic, fear, suffocation and even dying, the authors said. They made a series of recommendations, including the introduction of a simple anaesthesia check list which should be performed at the start of every operation. They also called for a structured approach to the management of patients who report awareness. 'We found that patients are at higher risk of experiencing accidental awareness during general anaesthesia (AAGA) during caesarean section and cardiothoracic surgery, if they are obese or when there is difficulty managing the airway at the start of anaesthesia,' said project lead professor Jaideep Pandit, a consultant anaesthetist in Oxford. 'The use of some emergency drugs heightens risk, as does the use of certain anaesthetic techniques. However, the most compelling risk factor is the use of muscle relaxants, which prevent the patient moving.'","One in every 19,000 patients experience 'accidental awareness'

"Smartphones and the new Apple Watch could kill off cash, cards and even the supermarket check-out as shoppers are encouraged to use them to scan and pay for their groceries.

Payment is made via a smartphone app linked to the shopper’s bank account or card, so there is no need to queue at a till. The Mobile Scan & Go service is the latest example of smartphones being used as electronic wallets. It is now impossible to buy a ticket on a London bus with cash, but travellers can pay by swiping a phone over a terminal. A coffee can be bought by tapping a smartphone on a till reader too. This week, tech giant Apple unveiled a system called Apple Pay. Its latest iPhone handsets and watch are fitted with a tiny antenna which, when held over a terminal, triggers a payment via a radio link. Apple Pay is an update of a smartphone app called Easy Pay, already in use in the trial with Sainsbury’s and other retailers. US household names McDonald’s, Subway and Walgreens, which is taking over Boots chemist, have rushed to sign up. Tech firms Google and PayPal also have their own mobile phone payment systems and supermarkets are racing to use them. Sainsbury’s Mobile Scan & Go began in three small stores, but is being rolled out to ten including its Colney hypermarket. It is the latest in a string of check-out innovations by the supermarket giants. Self-service tills are a fixture in many stores. Tesco is testing automated smart tills with conveyor belts that handle three trolley loads at a time. Many chains, including Sainsbury’s, also offer handheld monitors that let shoppers scan items as they go. But Sainsbury’s chief information officer, Rob Fraser, said it is likely to opt for more smartphone payments rather than the scanners. He said: ‘The economics on Mobile Scan & Go is much better, but we do need to make sure it all makes sense for customers.’ In theory, the system could give stores unlimited access to customers’ spending patterns – although Apple insists it will not collect personal data. It uses short distance radio signals known as Near Field Communication (NFC). Tim Erlin, of the security firm Tripwire, warned: ‘[Apple’s] entrance into the arena will greatly speed adoption of the technology, and the attention it gets from potential attackers. ‘NFC isn’t as well-tested as the more common wireless technologies. We may see the rise of the modern-day pickpocket.’ Smart: The Mobile Scan & Go service is the latest example of smartphones being used as electronic wallets .

"Shia LaBeouf has pleaded guilty to disorderly conduct stemming from an incident at a Broadway show in June. The 28-year-old actor looked forlorn as he entered court accompanied by his legal team, dressed in a sharp suit and tie but with a scruffy beard and hair. He entered the plea on Wednesday before a Manhattan judge. If LaBeouf remains in treatment for three months and stays out of trouble for six months, he'll be able to withdraw the plea and the case will be dismissed. Scroll down for video . The 28-year-old actor appeared subdued as he appeared in a Manhattan court on Wednesday morning to plead guilty to disorderly conduct . Shia LaBeouf, pictured on June 26, gets in a confrontation with a homeless man hours before his arrest in New York City . Disorderly conduct is a violation, not a criminal offense. His publicist has said the episode stemmed from an alcohol problem and that the actor has since gotten treatment. Following his brief court appearance today, the 28-year-old was seen in jeans and a Jetsons T-shirt checking out of the Greenwich Hotel in downtown Manhattan with a backpack. LaBeouf was accused of disrupting a performance of Cabaret starring Alan Cumming. On June 26, the former child actor had reportedly spent the afternoon drinking margaritas at Iguana Bar in Midtown and watching Belgium play South Korea in the World Cup. Later that afternoon, he was seen wild-eyed and disheveled as he chased a homeless man through traffic in broad daylight around the city's Theater District, photographs show. It seemed the actor wanted either a bag of McDonald's food or a baseball cap that the man had. The actor repeatedly said: 'It's me, Shia', earlier reports showed.

LaBeouf was surrounded by news crews as he entered court to answer to a disorderly conduct charge in New York City on Wednesday . Shia La Beouf (pictured left on Wednesday and right, in June) has entered an alcohol treatment program, his publicist said . Then, hours later, the troubled actor was led away in tears from the Studio 54 theater on West 54th Street around after causing the disturbance during the first act of Cabaret. On Twitter, Tony nominated composer Benj Pasek wrote: 'Just saw Shia LaBeouf in handcuffs in tears surrounded by 6 police offers outside of Cabaret the musical.' LaBeouf screamed at the arresting officer: 'F*** you... this is f****** b******t... Do you know my life? Do you know who the f*** I am?', according to The Smoking Gun. Officers told the New York Post that LaBeouf was 'incoherent and agitated' during the arrest. One said that the actor smelled bad and told lies about having served in the military. Since the melee, he has been taking part in an outpatient alcohol treatment program. LaBeouf is best known for appearing in the first three Transformers films. The actor, who is best known for his Transformers films, left court with a bodyguard and the help of the NYPD . The Transformers actor leaving court in Manhattan on Wednesday where he was ordered to remain in treatment for another three months . LaBeouf's lawyers address the media outside court on Wednesday after he was ordered to stay out of trouble for six months . Shia LaBeouf's arrest for disorderly conduct at a Broadway theater in June is just the latest incident in a string of erratic episodes for the former child star. At the end of last year, the Transformers star admitted that he had plagiarized 52-year-old cartoonist Daniel Clowes' graphic novel in a short film, HowardCantour.com, starring Jim Gaffigan. Making a point: LaBeouf at the Berlin Film Festival in February . Observant viewers attacked the film as an almost direct adaptation of Clowes' 2007 comic even though Shia had initially failed to give Daniel any credit. His actions were called 'shameless theft' by the comic's publisher Eric Reynolds and a steady string of apologies from Shia ensued. He then made headlines when he walked the red carpet at the Berlin Film Festival with a brown paper bag over his head. Around the same time he declared he was 'retiring from public life because of attacks against his artistic integrity'. Early this year, LaBeouf also got into a scuffle with a fellow drinker at the Hobgoblin pub in New Cross, South London, headbutting him apparently over remarks made about the mother of his girlfriend Mia Goth. And last year, the actor famously quit the production of Broadway's ORPHANS then shared several confrontational emails between himself and fellow actors Alex Baldwin and Tom Sturridge, explaining why he pulled out of the show. In 2007, he was arrested for refusing to leave a Walgreens in Chicago but the criminal charges were later dropped. In February 2005, LaBeouf was arrested in Los Angeles and charged with assault with a deadly weapon for driving into his neighbor's car after losing his temper about having to wait to get into his garage. He then later turned up at his neighbor's door, allegedly waving a kitchen knife.","The actor entered the plea on Wednesday before a Manhattan judge after the incident at a Broadway performance of Cabaret in June .

"TV star Nev Schulman was expelled from school for punching a girl, it has emerged. The presenter of MTV's dating docu-series Catfish has been a prominent voice in the fight to stop domestic violence. He openly condemned NFL star Ray Rice for allegedly punching his wife unconscious, tweeting a picture of himself in an elevator with the caption: 'Cowards make me sick. Real men show strength through patience & honor. This elevator is abuse free'. Revealed: Catfish presenter Nev Schulman, 29, was expelled from college after punching a girl at a dance . But it has now emerged that the 29-year-old was arrested and sent down in his junior year of Sarah Lawrence College, Bronxville, after hitting a female student. Writing in his new book, out last week, Schulman reveals he was taking photographs of friends at a dance titled Sleaze Ball when a girl started on him. He claims she tackled him to the ground, pulling the camera which was attached to a strap around his neck. 'In an effort to free myself,' he writes, 'I punched the person and ran off; when I returned minutes later, I discovered that the short, stocky, crew-cut-styled individual I'd fought with was a woman - a fact that I hadn't been aware of in the heat of the moment. 'The next thing I knew, I'd been arrested.' However, witnesses dispute his version of events. Condemned: .

"Police say that have identified five teenage suspects involved in dumping bodily fluids on a 15-year-old autistic teen who thought he was participating in the 'Ice Bucket Challenge.' Evidence against the suspects, who are between the ages of 14 and 17, will be presented to the Cuyahoga County prosecutor's office early next week to determine whether delinquency charges should be filed, Bay Village police chief Mark Spaetzel said today. But Bay Village schools superintendent Clint Keener has said that although the video is 'reprehensible', there is little the school district can do to punish the teens because the prank occurred off school property before the start of the school year. Scroll down for video . Unaware: This 15-year-old autistic boy from Ohio agreed to take the ALS ice bucket challenge, not knowing that the teens who asked him to do it were playing a sick prank on him . Humiliating: Standing in his underwear outside a garage, the teen was doused with a mixture of urine, feces, saliva and cigarette butts . Today Spaetzel said detectives have focused on the suspects' social media accounts, such as Instagram, and that investigators are in the process of acquiring the teens' cellphones and obtaining their text messages. The autistic teen thought he was participating in the challenge benefiting the ALS Association and the fight against Lou Gehrig's disease. He thought he would be getting doused with ice and water but instead someone on a garage roof dumped feces, urine and spit on him, the boy's mother has said. An attorney for the teen and his family said the teen was betrayed by people whom he thought were his friends. The episode drew widespread attention after the mother of the autistic teen found a video of it on his cellphone and gave media outlets permission to make it available online. Spaetzel said the prank occurred at one of the suspect's homes. Police and city officials have been besieged by calls from media from all over the world and from those outraged by the vicious prank. Furious: The boy's parents and his older brother (centre) now want the bullies responsible for the sickening bucket challege held accountable for their actions . 'It's been a little crazy,' Spaetzel said. The case took on another dimension when Drew Carey, the comedian, game show host and Cleveland native, was joined by other celebrities in offering reward money to help police identify suspects. Spaetzel and others have said police already were well on their way to identifying who was involved when the offers came in. Spaetzel praised Bay Village school officials for turning the case into a 'teachable moment.' Students held a rally before a football game last week in support of the teen.

"People with conservative views are more content than their more liberal-minded neighbours, research suggests. Those with politics that lean to the Right were found to have higher levels of well-being – even when their favoured political party was in opposition. They benefit from the belief that problems are a person’s own making – which helps them deal better with whatever life throws at them. Scroll down for video . Right frame of mind: Those with politics that lean to the Right were found to have higher levels of well-being, according to U.S. researchers . The findings come from a U.S. study that examined data involving more than a million people from 16 European countries, including the UK. Analysis of information such as political beliefs and welfare spending showed that people living in more liberal countries had higher average well-being than those ruled by the Right. But individuals with conservative politics were more satisfied with their lot wherever they were. Adam Okulicz-Kozaryn, of Rutgers University in New Jersey: ‘These findings lead us to believe that conservatives living in liberal countries are most likely to report the highest well-being.’ Writing in the Journal of Applied Psychology, he said Left-wing policies on welfare, pensions and jobs can make a country happier overall. ‘Liberal governments tend to do more to shield citizens against certain hardships, such as unemployment and poverty, which can make people happier,’ he added.","Right-wingers benefit from belief that problems are a person’s own making .

"The Taliban are just 'days away' of recapturing a region in Afghanistan which claimed the lives of 150 British and US troops during the eight-year conflict. Rebels are surrounding the towns of Musa Qala, Nawzad and Sangin in the Helmand Province as the Taliban seeks to reclaim areas cleared by NATO troops. The Afghan National Security Force is attempting to hold onto the area but are engaged in fierce fighting with the Taliban. Taliban forces have captured 70 per cent of Sangin, pictured, which was a major British military base . The Taliban want to recapture the towns of Nawzad, Musa Qala and Sangin in Helmand Province . British troops regularly patrolled Musa Qala after the Taliban were forced to retreat from the area . According to The Times, heavy fighting has taken place in the region as the Taliban seeks to regain control of its main opium production area. In Musa Qala, the Taliban are only 50 metres from the town centre, while over in Sangin, pro-government forces control only 30 per cent of the town. Afghan officials have claimed that the Taliban has launched 800 attacks around Sangin in the past month. Sayed Mohammad, head of the local district council in Musa Qala said: 'From 15 days, fighting is going on. The reason is the government is weak and doesn't have heavy weapons. The police chief and district chief are still in place, but we are not sure for how long.' Abdul Bari Barakzai added: 'The fighting is still going on in three districts. Afghan security forces are on the defensive. They are very tired. If one district fall, the other will also fall.'

"A century-old waterfront cottage on Sydney's northern beaches that had been handed down through the generations of one family has sold for a record price of $2.2 million. Set on 367 square metres of land, the Carrington Parade property in Freshwater was last built in 1913 after the land was bought seven years earlier for 50 pounds and five shillings. The three-bedroom timber home 'set a new land value record within the area' at Saturday's auction, estate agent James Smyth told Daily Mail Australia. The $2.2 million price tag surpassed its expected selling price of $1.85 million, he said. A 101-year-old beach front cottage in Freshwater, New South Wales, was bought at auction for $2.2 million on Saturday . Set on 367 square metres of land, the property was last bought in 1906 for 50 pounds and five shillings . 'You always get homes where it has been the same families living there for generations,' Mr Smyth, from Smyth Estate Agents said. 'I've had one that's stayed in the family for 75 years. 'But this one had been in the one family, handed down from mother to daughter and then again to the most recent owner, for more than 101 years.' 'There was a very small cottage put on it that took two years to be built, which was erected in 1913, and it's effectively the same one that is on there today.' The property was put up for sale only after its former owner, Rita Edwards,  died  three weeks shy of her 100th birthday recently. Rita, a German, was married twice before she  moved in to the property with her third husband David Edwards, whose mother was the original owner. Rita was married to a Latvian who died in WWII - before she migrated to Australia in 1948 with her second husband Janis, before he died from stomach cancer just two months after they moved. Rita's long-time neighbour  Gabriella Lang said this left Rita stranded in Australia 'without anything.' 'She had no money, no family, nothing,' Mrs Lang said. Rita Edwards was broke, with no family or money, before she met David Edwards and the pair moved into the Carrington Parade property . Ms Edwards was 'a local character' who was 'a little wild in her older age', and very well loved in the community . Rita as pictured shortly after migrating to Australia, and later on in the garden of her property . But fortunately for Rita she married again for a third time, in 1951, and moved into the Carrington Parade property two years later with her husband David Edwards after his mother died. 'David inherited the home after his mother died,' she said. Ms Edwards was 'a local character' who was 'a little wild in her older age', and very well loved in the community, Mr Smyth said. 'Everyone was always aware of and checking in on her. She used to walk to Freshwater village on a daily basis for her 10:25am cup of tea and half a sausage roll,' he said. Mrs Lang said she was a stubborn woman up until the day she died, refusing to move out of the water front home until last year when she was placed into a nursing home. 'Rita insisted on living there, she wasn't prepared to go in to a nursing home.' But she eventually did, and it was at this point Ms Lang took legal responsibility of the property's affairs. 'She couldn't continue to live alone, so I officially managed her affairs when she went into the Austral house nursing home.' The property was put on the market soon after its former owner, Rita Edwards, died recently a few weeks short of her 100th birthday . The RSL Art Union Prize Home Lottery bought the property, and plans to redevelop it before offering it as a prize, the agent said . Rita died exactly a year to the day the property went to Auction on September 6, and had she had been alive, she would have been 100-years-old. The rustic home, featuring an outdoor toilet, was bought by the RSL Art Union Prize Home Lottery, a charity organisation that buys properties and offers them as lottery prizes in support of Australian war veterans. 'And I am pleased that the RSL bought it,' Mrs Lang said, keeping the land in the hands of a 'strong returned services connection.' Laura and her husband were both in WWI, and Rita, being a German, lived through the second world war before she migrated to Australia. The organisation plans to knock down the cottage and build a designer home in its place that will be offered as the first prize in a lottery to be held in the next 12 to 18 months, Mr Smyth said. The perks of the property's cliff-top location were revealed to the eight registered bidders at Saturday's auction when they were distracted by the panoramic marine views - and some local marine wildlife. 'Right in the middle of the action there was a pod of five dolphins cruising right out the front of the house,' he said. The sight of the dolphins distracted the whole crowd, including the auctioneer, who struggled to redirect people's attention back to the sale.' The redeveloped property will be offered as a lottery prize in the next 12-18 months, the agent said . The auction was interrupted part-way through when a pod of dolphins swam by, catching the attention of the crowd .","The cliff-top 367 sqm property was last bought in 1911 for 50 pounds and five shillings .
It has been passed down through one family for more than a century .
It belonged to a wealthy English woman before it was inherited by her son .
His wife, Rita, moved in with him in 1953 and the pair lived in it until he died in 1981 .

"Miss America Organization officials are hopeful Miss Rhode Island will be able to compete in Wednesday night's preliminary competition after she fainted on stage the previous night. Pageant officials are monitoring Ivy DePew's medical condition. DePew was treated and released from a hospital after she apparently fainted during an awards presentation Tuesday night, which was led by New Jersey Lt. Gov. Kim Guadagno inside Atlantic City's Boardwalk Hall. She was standing in the back row of contestants  when she collapsed. 'During the Tuesday night preliminary competition, Miss Rhode Island, Ivy DePew fainted on stage, and today, she is doing much better,' Sharon Pearce, president of the Miss America organization said in a statement sent to MailOnline Wednesday morning. 'The Miss America Organization is in close communication with Ivy and her medical team,' Pearce said. 'We look forward to Ivy resuming her activities today and continuing to compete for the 2015 Miss America Competition this week.' Pageant officials would not release any information on what caused DePew to become ill. Dena Blizzard, the pageant's host, told the audience 'She just got a little overheated.' Scare: Miss Rhode Island Ivy DePew collapsed onstage and was taken to a hospital for treatment Tuesday evening . Pageant officials say it still hasn't been determined whether she will compete. On Tuesday, Pearce told The Associated Press 'She fainted, but she will be OK.' Sam Haskell III, CEO of the Miss America Organization, said Tuesday that DePew was alert and talking as she left Boardwalk Hall with her family en route to a hospital. He did not know if she would need to stay overnight. DePew had competed earlier in the evening in the pageant's swimsuit and evening gown competition. The Philadelphia Inquirer reported that supporters tweeted '#prayersforivy.' Treatment: Sam Haskell III, CEO of the Miss America Organization, said DePew was alert and talking as she left Boardwalk Hall with her family en route to a hospital . Winners: Miss Ohio Mackenzie Bart, left, won the talent competition for a ventriloquism routine, and Miss Florida Victoria Cowen, right, won the swimsuit competition . Miss Florida Victoria Cowen won the swimsuit competition Tuesday, while Miss Ohio Mackenzie Bart won the talent competition for a ventriloquism routine. Bart wowed the crowd with a ventriloquism routine in which her dummy appeared to sing the Mary Poppins song 'Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious.' 'I was obsessed with Lamb Chop and I loved Shari Lewis,' Bart told reporters afterward. 'I used to sit with an old sock and I would mimic what they were doing. I just loved it.' The start of competition came on the same day that yet another casino company, Trump Entertainment Resorts, filed for bankruptcy and threatened to close what will soon be its lone remaining casino, the Trump Taj Mahal Casino Resort, in November. It would be the fifth of the 12 casinos Atlantic City began the year with to close this year. So the start of the Miss America pageant, an Atlantic City icon for generations, is a welcome diversion for some from the bad news settling over the city like Boardwalk fog. 'Our hearts go out to the many, many people who have lost their jobs,' Haskell said. 'We hope that the Miss America competition, the Show Us Your Shoes parade and all the wonderful events this week are going to help bring some happiness and joy to this great city that serves as the birthplace of Miss America. We know what's going on here and we want to be something positive.' The next Miss America will be crowned Sunday night. Here we are! The Miss America contestants are seen Tuesday evening .","Miss Rhode Island Ivy DePew collapsed onstage Tuesday evening .

"Millie Mackintosh is no stranger to the fashion industry. The 25-year-old has modeled for fashion labels such as Lipsy and jewellery treasure trove Claire's Accessories and is a regular on the front rows of London Fashion Week. But now - finally! - the stylish Chelsea socialite and business woman has released her very own clothing line. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Millie Mackintosh has today launched her first collection for her clothing line.  Here Millie wears the patterned shift dress £90 . Today sees the launch of Millie's first ever fashion collection - Millie Mackintosh. Following eight months of design and development the capsule collection consists of 40 unique pieces including dresses, tops, jumpsuits and jackets. Millie who certainly has a keen eye on the industry, and has had a hands-on approach from the label's beginnings says it has been a hectic couple of months to get the collection ready. Millie has taken inspiration from her own wardrobe for the collection. Left Millie wears . Millie has included a few investment pieces to be worn season after season  such as this jacket £250 . 'I have been working on it for eight months.' Says Millie, 'Usually designers take years before they launch a collection but we wanted to create a capsule line. 'We originally only wanted to do 20 pieces but we have ended up with 40 so it has been a bit of a whirlwind.' Millie's collection doesn't look dissimilar to her typical outfit choices and that's because it isn't. When it came to design inspiration Millie says she looked no further than yours truly. 'I wanted the collection to represent me and I created it for myself really. It features a lot of embellishment which I love and we have some faux leather look pants and shorts. 'I really love the whole 60s and 70s look and that is reflected in the collection. It has quite a boho and vintage style, I wanted it to be quite young and fun.' Model behaviour: Millie models the entire collection herself . The capsule collection is made up of 40 pieces and took Millie 8 months to design and develop . Millie hopes that her clothing line will attract the likes of Cheryl Cole and Abby Clancy. High-slit maxi skirt £59 . For Millie versatility was hugely important in her range. She wanted pieces that would stand the test of time so that her customers weren't forking out for a new wardrobe each season. 'I wanted the collection to be quite timeless so that women could get a lot of wear out of them. There is that investment feel with a few pricier pieces. 'We have some really lovely blouses in black and cream that you can dress up in different ways. I wanted it so that you could take it from the office to the dance floor.' For the fashion fanatic her collection has been a long time coming having always dreamt of owing her own boutique and creating her own clothes with a sewing machine as a child. 'This has always been my dream since I was little, to have my own shop. But we have been really lucky in getting it out there on the high street.' Mrs Professor Green is thrilled to finally be able to show off her designs after months of planning and says that the initial reaction has been really positive. Millie says that having her own clothing line has been a lifelong dream. Here she wears the double breasted lurex waistcoat £140 . 'It is so exciting but it is also so surreal to finally have it out after just working towards it. Up until now I have only been allowed to tease people but I have had a great response from my friends which I always think is the most important. 'I was really worried about showing them because if your friends don't like it then you haven't got a chance! But they were really impressed so that was great.' Millie's is a style that many try to emulate themselves with the Internet flooded with blogs instructing fans on how to get her look. When it comes to who she wants to see in her collection Millie has high hopes. 'Someone said to me today that they could see Cheryl Cole wearing it which would just be amazing! She would make the collection sell out! I could see Abby Clancy wearing it because the collection has a glamorous and girly feel.' Other than celebrity aspirations Millie is looking forward to being able to wear the range herself after having to keep it under wraps for months. 'I haven't been allowed to wear my collection until now! I have only just been allowed to have the samples that have been stored at the factory. 'We were worried that people would see pictures of me wearing them and cheaper designers would create knock-offs really quickly which we really didn't want. I am in New York this week to see a few shows so it will be great to finally have my clothes to wear for that.' Despite her busy year, it appears that launching a clothing line isn't enough for ambitious Millie who also has plans to add author to her résumé. 'I have my lifestyle book coming out next year but I actually need to write it! I have a lot of travelling plans though so there will be no champagne and movies on the flight and instead I will just have to work and write the thing!' For now though having finally realised her life long dream Millie says she couldn't be happier. 'I love my work. People always say love what you do for a living and I absolutely do, I am living the dream and it is a dream come true.' Millie Mackintosh's clothing collection is available in sizes 6-16 and  is available to purchase at www.millie-mackintosh.com as well as other major UK retailers from the October 15.

"An open jail has been condemned as a laughing stock after a second prisoner went missing in a week – bringing the total on the run to 82. Burglar Greg Disbrey, 27, simply walked out of Ford Open Prison on Monday and has not been seen since. Three days before, thug Lucas Lamb absconded from the Category D facility in Arundel, West Sussex. On the run: Greg Disbrey (left) and Lucas Lamb (right) have both absconded from Ford Open Prison in West Sussex in the last week - bringing the total number of prisoners who have gone missing to 82 . Sussex Police said Disbrey has links to Edgware in north London and Devon, and was sentenced to three-and-a-half years for burglary and handling stolen goods in 2012. The jail holds 521 inmates - meaning the total who have absconded are equal to almost a sixth of its capacity. Andy Silvester, of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘Taxpayers will be shocked their money is being used to run a laughing stock of a prison. ‘They rightly expect that prisoners are not able to wander off at their leisure.’ Yesterday figures obtained via a Freedom of Information request revealed that the two men bring the total missing from Ford to 82. This includes two murderers, a kidnapper and five other violent criminals. About half have been missing for at least four years, and 18 escaped in the 1990s. Slammed: Some 82 prisoners are missing from Ford Open Prison in West Sussex, many for several years . Justice campaigner Peter Cuthbertson slammed the lax security at the prison. The director of the campaign group Centre for Crime Prevention said: 'Open prisons in general and HMP Ford in particular have a terrible record for prisoner escapes. 'Eighty-two separate cases is an appalling figure. 'It is dangerous to rely on prisons that have such a bad record of escapes, and it’s high time to stop the overuse of open prisons.' Police described Disbrey as white, 5ft 7ins tall and with a pierced eyebrow, two large moles behind his right ear and a tattoo of a cross on his right forearm. The Ministry of Justice declined to comment.","Latest to vanish from Ford Open Prison, West Sussex, is Greg Disbrey .

"'Curmudgeonly': The host o Radio 4’s Today programme revealed his daughter had nominated him for the challenge - but has dismissed it as a 'stunt' It has been embraced by pop stars and politicians and raised millions for charity. But BBC presenter John Humphrys has criticised the Ice Bucket Challenge as a ‘stunt’, saying we should give because we want to help good causes, not because of fads. The host of Radio 4’s Today programme revealed his daughter had nominated him for the challenge – in which people donate money after filming themselves being doused in ice water, before nominating someone else. Famous participants include former US president George Bush, pop star Justin Bieber, David Beckham and Hollywood star Tom Cruise, raising more than £60million for US motor neurone charity the ALS Association, and more than £3million for Macmillan Cancer Support in the UK. But Mr Humphrys, 71, said: ‘It’s certainly been hugely successful at raising awareness of the hideous motor neurone disease and it’s undoubtedly raised a lot of money. ‘But as someone who set up his own modest charity a few years ago, I have mixed feelings about persuading people to support a charity with stunts. ‘Is it too sanctimonious to say that charity should be about giving because it’s a worthwhile cause that we really want to help?’ Writing in Waitrose Weekend magazine, he added: ‘Still, it’s preferable to all those appeals from people who ask for your help for something they’re madly keen to do anyway. ‘We’ve all had the letters: “I plan to raise loads of money for my local cats’ home by cycling around Cuba. Please help!” ‘I’m always tempted to reply: “If you really want to help your local cats’ home, why not stay home and give them all the money it will cost to send you on a lovely holiday?” Mr Humphrys – who has a son and daughter with his first wife Edna and a 13-year-old son with BBC presenter Valerie Sanderson – set up the Kitchen Table Charities Trust in 2005. Its purpose is to raise money for other small charities that do not have their own fundraising arms, and it is opposed to ‘charity as big business’. Mr Humphrys admitted his views might seem a little ‘curmudgeonly’, but he said he was dismayed when his editor on Today recently joked that he would be expected to complete the Ice Bucket Challenge on air. Describing his immediate reaction, he said: ‘Unwelcome and, given a moment’s thought, unlikely – but just about plausible. I should be so plucky: Kylie Minogue completes the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge alongside her designer friend Stefano Gabbana . ‘It wouldn’t be the first time we’d done something daft on Today and, given the relentless tide of dire news over the summer, maybe the audience needed a bit of a break. ‘But not this! Not on Today! Surely my editor was winding me up. He was. Crisis and potential presenter rebellion averted.’ He added: ‘The problem is, charity has become big business and fundraising is all about clever marketing. Pity they can’t let the cause speak for itself.’","Host of Radio 4's Today show revealed his daughter had nominated him .

"She was a former showgirl turned exuberant socialite who acquired a taste for the high life through a succession of marriages to wealthy businessmen. Little wonder that a car designed by Lady Docker was a monument to extravagance, from its royal blue crocodile skin trim, hand-woven silk upholstery and a silver mascot modelled on her naked body. Now her Daimler DK400 ‘Stardust’ limousine is expected to fetch up to £160,000 when it is auctioned on Saturday. Scroll down for video . Extravagant: The exterior of the royal blue limousine, designed by Lady Docker to revive a struggling Daimler, is finished with 5,000 hand-painted silver stars . Lavish: The 1954 vehicle features hand-woven silk upholstery, aluminium cabinets trimmed with blue crocodile skin and electronic double-glazed windows . Luxurious: Lady Docker, pictured powdering her face in the back of the 'Stardust' Daimler, wanted to transform the car company's staid image in post-war Britain . The . restored 1954 vehicle is one of five cars commissioned and styled by . Lady Docker, hallmarked with what Bonhams auctioneers call . ‘awe-inspiring excess’. Lady . Docker put her own stamp on the car in an attempt to dust off the drab, . stuffy image she believed was blighting her husband’s Daimler firm in . post-war Britain. But it was so outrageously ambitious it cost company . chairman Sir Bernard Docker his job and nearly bankrupted the company. Although . Daimler was a long-time favourite of the Royal Family, Lady Docker told . her husband it could not survive on status alone and convinced him the . firm needed ‘shaking up’.The car cost £12,500 to transform, far more . than the cost of a good semi-detached house in those days. It . has 5,000 stars hand-painted in silver on the coachwork and Lady Docker . chose hand-woven grey silk brocatelle for the rear upholstery . (declaring that ‘mink is too hot to sit on’). Four crocodile skin . suitcases were tailored to fit the boot. The . couple used the car at the wedding of Grace Kelly and Prince Rainier of . Monaco and their invitations are offered for sale with the car at the . auction in Chichester, West Sussex. The . ‘Docker Specials’ never caught on in austere post-war Britain, although . a more understated model was later built for the Queen Mother. Sir . Bernard, accused of allowing his wife to build the car for her own . amusement, was voted out of office. They were later expelled from their Monaco home and Lady Docker died almost penniless in a London hotel in 1983. Additional reporting by Stephanie Linning for MailOnline.

Royal favourite: The 'Stardust' was shipped to France for the wedding of Prince Rainier of Monaco and film star Grace Kelly, which Lord and Lady Docker attended . Spacious: The pale pink hand-woven silk upholstery on the back seat contrasts prettily with the custom blue crocodile skin trim, which is bathed in light from the sunroof . Excessive: Its royal blue coachwork was bodied by coachbuilder Hooper & Co for £12,500 - more than the average price for a semi-detached house at the time .

Indian police have arrested Indian businessman Sujoy Mitra, 35, and he has been remanded in custody until later this week. ‘We suspect the accused laced the tea with drugs and raped the Irish woman,’ police officer Subrata Dey said. Local media said Mitra brought the woman to his house in the Kalighat area of the city after a night out. He appeared in court in Alipore on Sunday for a preliminary hearing and denies the allegations. The number of high-profile rape cases in India have sparked passionate protests and seen a drop in the number of women tourists travelling to the country over safety fears . A lawyer for the accused, Dibyendu . Bhattachrya, told local media: ‘After accompanying him to his house, the . lady stayed with him for nearly two hours and even had breakfast. The . allegations are totally false and motivated. My client is a . teetotaller.’ The alleged . attacks are the latest cases of sexual assaults on foreign women in . India that have led to warnings about women travelling to the country. A spokesman for the Irish Department of Foreign Affairs said it was providing consular assistance to the woman. It is understood diplomatic staff were notified of the case at the weekend and officials from the embassy in New Delhi are dealing with it. IndiaToday reported that the woman had been in India working with an NGO based in Darjeeling. Tourists travelling to India have dropped by 25 per cent since the high-profile rape and murder of an Indian student in New Delhi. A woman takes part in a protest following the death of a student who was gang-raped in Delhi. The outcry led to tougher laws against sexual assaults . The number of women tourists has dropped by 35 per cent, a study found, following warnings about safety in the country. The Irish Department of Foreign Affairs has advised women going to India to exercise caution. Its website says women should not . travel alone and be careful when selecting accommodation, and as . recently as May 21 it updated information on the risks involved. It warns: 'Tourists have been the . victims of sexual assault in Agra, Goa, Delhi, Bangalore, Madyha Pradesh . and Rajasthan. Women travellers often receive unwanted attention in the . form of verbal and physical harassment. 'Women travellers should exercise caution when travelling in India.' A Swiss woman was gang-raped during a cycling holiday in central India with her husband in March. A South Korean tourist was allegedly drugged and raped in the same state in January by the son of the owner of a hotel where she was staying. Also in January, a British woman leaped from her hotel room balcony in Agra, where she was visiting the Taj Mahal, when she feared being sexually assaulted by a member of her hotel staff. The assaults come amid heightened concern about sexual assaults in India . that followed the fatal gang-rape of a young woman on a moving bus in . New Delhi in December. That rape sparked public protests demanding better protection for women. In response, the government passed a law increasing prison terms for . rape and providing for the death penalty in cases of rape that result in . death or leave the victim in a coma. It also made voyeurism, stalking, . acid attacks and the trafficking of women punishable under criminal law.

"This is the amazing moment when a blue heron pounces on a defenceless gopher who is hiding out in the back garden of a Washington home. Jessie Garza, from Zillah, Washington, filmed the bird as it slowly walked across the grass, staring intently at a particular spot. The blue heron pauses briefly, tensing up before it shoots its head forward, capturing the unfortunate gopher between its powerful beak. The blue heron spots the small gopher, circled, hiding in the grass in Jessie Garza's back garden and closes in . The bird tenses itself as it prepares to launch itself at the unsuspecting gopher who is just inches from danger . The small gopher spends one minute wriggling in a desperate attempt to free itself from the predator. Then, for one brief moment it seems that the rattled rodent was about to escape to freedom after the bird dropped the animal to the ground. However, within a fraction of a second, the blue heron pounced again. This time, the bird is far more confident, raising its head and opening its gullet. Then, without any warning, the blue heron opened its beak, swallowing the gopher in one gulp. The bird conducts an inch-perfect strike, grabbing the gopher with its powerful beak and lifting it skywards . The heron juggles with the gopher as it tries to break free and escape certain death . Then, without warning, the heron drops the stunned gopher, but any respite is brief as the bird pounces again . Despite making its way to the bird's stomach, the still live gopher can be seen struggling as the heron forces down its throat. According to Mr Garza: 'For about a week we noticed that this Blue Heron hanging around our home and neighbors homes so, I took pictures of it. 'But we couldn't figure out why it was still hanging around. Then on this particular day on June 26, 2014 he was so close to our house, so I decided to video tape him. 'When you see this video, you will learn why he was hanging around.' After one minute of struggling, the blue heron is preparing the small gopher for its final journey . With one gulp, the blue heron swallows the gopher whole, which can still be seen wriggling inside the bird .","Jessie Garza started filming the blue heron who began visiting his garden .

"Winter in Britain could be set to get much worse as weather conditions are becoming more volatile because of changes in pressure over the North Atlantic, scientists have warned. While most seasons have not changed dramatically over the past century - studies have shown that winter is becoming much more unpredictable. A study of seasonal records dating back to 1899 by the University of East Anglia (UEA), . University of Sheffield and the Met Office found that seven out of the . 10 most extreme winter conditions over the last 115 years have occurred . in the last decade. Scroll down for video . Marked differences between centres of low and high barometric pressure (known as Iceland and the Azores, respectively) cause strong westerlies, bringing mild, wet and often stormy weather (left) in winter. Weaker differences cause the jet stream to wander into a 'blocking' position, bringing drier and snowier weather . The results suggest the idea of a typical British 'white' winter is increasingly becoming a myth, with one year experiencing mild but stormy conditions while deep snow could follow 12 months later. Professor Phil Jones, from the University of East Anglia’s climatic research unit, said: 'This indicates that British winters have become increasingly unsettled. 'If this trend continues, we can expect more volatile UK winter weather in decades to come.' Winter conditions are commonly defined using North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) - a system of barometric pressure variations which indicates the strength of westerly winds approaching the UK. When there are marked differences between low and high centres of barometric pressure - known as Iceland and the Azores, respectively - westerly winds are strong, Britain experiences mild, wet and often stormy weather - like last winter. Winter in Britain could be set to get much worse as weather conditions become more volatile, scientists have warned . Weaker differences or reverse airflow typically brings cold, snowy weather, such as that experienced in 2009/10 and 2010/11. The variations were particularly noticeable in early winter. Mr Jones said: 'When we look at the month of December in particular, our data shows that over the last 115 years, three out of five all-time record high NAO values and two out of five record lows took place in the last decade.' Professor Edward Hanna, from the University of Sheffield’s department of geography, said it was too soon to say whether the increased volatility is linked to global warming. The results suggest the idea of a typical British 'white' winter is increasingly becoming a myth, with one year experiencing mild but stormy conditions while deep snow could follow 12 months later . But the study, published in the International Journal Of Climatology, states that it was extreme unlikely the clustering of extreme conditions had happened by chance. The trend could be due to random fluctuations in the climate system but could equally be due to factors including changing pressure and weather systems over the Arctic, especially Greenland, and changes in energy coming from the sun. Mr Hanna said: 'We cannot use these results directly to predict this winter’s weather but, according to the long-term NAO trend, we can say that the probability of getting extreme winter weather - either mild/stormy or cold/snowy - has significantly increased in the last few decades.'","Studies of seasons since 1899 show winter becoming more unpredictable .

"As Prince Harry was having an early night yesterday to prepare for the launch of the Invictus Games, his ex-girlfriend Chelsy Davy was gallivanting around west London with her long-term love Charles Goode. The blonde lawyer's relationship with the jeweler has been getting increasingly serious over the last few months, with rumours flying in recent weeks that an engagement announcement will soon be made. Chelsy, 28, and Charles, 30, spent the second half of August travelling through Zambia, Mozambique, and Malawi on a romantic adventure holiday together. Scroll down for video . Chelsy Davy and Charles Goode at the Barr and Bass launch party in Chelsea last night . Outdoor-loving Chelsy joined Charles on fishing trips and treks that included a hike up Mount Mulanje in southern Malawi. But despite friends of the couple speculating that the mountain-top setting would be the perfect place for a marriage proposal, Chelsy's ring finger was noticeably bare of sparkle during their outing to the Barr and Bass launch party in Chelsea last night. It's possible that the link to her ex's older brother's marriage proposal may have put Charles off asking for his girlfriend's hand during their summer holiday. Prince William asked Kate Middleton to be his wife during a trip they made to the spartan Rutundu Log Cabins during their Kenyan holiday in 2010. Chelsy Davy and Charles Goode arrived at the party fresh from their trip to Africa, where it was widely speculated the jeweler would propose . But diamond ring or not, the couple looked blissfully happy as they arrived at the bash on the King's Road. They weren't the only royal connection in the building - Donna Air, who is in a relationship with the Duchess of Cambridge's brother James was also in attendance. Meanwhile, across London Prince Harry was readying himself for a busy few days ahead of the Invictus Games Opening Ceremony tonight at the Olympics Stadium. Chelsy looked radiantly happy at the event on the Kings Road, showing off the hand that was absent of an engagement ring . The 29-year-old has already admitted to being overwhelmed by the workload that came with hosting the Games, which will see more than 400 war-wounded servicemen and women from 13 nations compete against each other. The six-day event isn't just sports-heavy; Coldplay are appearing at the concert tonight to perform the official anthem and the Red Arrows are doing a flypast, while the closing ceremony on September 14 will feature performances from James Blunt, the Military Wives Choir and Foo Fighters. The Games started ahead yesterday, ahead of tonight's Opening Ceremony, with the Prince attending a Reception at the American Ambassador's Residence, Winfield House alongside Foo Fighters front man Dave Grohl. Chelsy Davy and her boyfriend Charles Goode both sported a healthy tan from their adventure holiday in Africa . He said of his sleepless nights over the event's success: 'Of course I'm nervous. ‘There are times when we thought that we’re just never, ever going to get to the finish line. 'If all the venues sell out, then I’m happy because it’s all about the atmosphere and making these guys feel really special.' Prince Harry with the Foo Fighters Dave Grohl at an Invictus Games Reception at the American Ambassador's Residence, Winfield House in London yesterday . Prince Harry meeting servicemen and women at the Invictus Games welcome reception in west London . But while the Prince's work schedule has been punishingly busy of late, things have been unusually quiet on the romance front. Since splitting from his last serious girlfriend Cressida Bonas in April of this year, Harry has only briefly been linked with a few women, including a PR executive called Sarah Hazen at the Secret Garden Party festival and Halo Trust employee Camilla Thurlow. According to sources, he also made a play for Egyptian heiress Enayat Younes after bumping into her in a Spanish nightclub last month. Prince Harry and Chelsy Davy pictured at the Guards Polo Club, Windsor in 2006. The Prince has failed to find a similar long-term relationship since the end of their seven-year relationship . But so far no one has matched up to his seven-year on-off relationship with Chelsy, who many referred to as the love of his life. The Zimbabwean was largely considered to be a match for the the Prince in both personality and temperament, with her strong will enabling her to cope with the attention that comes from dating one of the world's most eligible bachelors. But the strict rules of living within the British monarchy eventually proved too much for Chelsy. Cressida Bonas was Prince Harry's last attempt at a relationship for Prince Harry, but the pair split in April after just over a year together . According to friends, it was Prince William's wedding to Kate Middleton in 2011 that proved to be the final nail in the coffin for Chelsy's relationship with Harry as she decided she couldn't permanently live the life of a royal. The couple remain good friends though and are reported to keep in touch regularly by phone, while their paths also frequently cross at society weddings of friends they share.","Charles Goode was expected to propose on African holiday last month .

"Fashion retailer American Apparel has agreed to pay $1million after a worker was crushed and 'mangled' a worker in a California factory. Tuan Phan, 49, was trying to clean a large knitting machine on August 19, 2011 in Garden Grove, Orange County when it started accidentally. The company agreed to pay $1million following Mr Phan's death, including $150,000 to his daughter. American Apparel agreed to pay $1m after worker Tuan Phan was mangled by a knitting machine in 2011 . According to Orange County Deputy District Attorney Kelly Roosevelt: 'At the time of the incident American Apparel utilised specific knitting machines, which must be disconnected from the main power supply before maintenance, as they may inadvertently start and the operator may be drawn into the machine. 'The machines are also required by law to be locked to prevent persons from entering and tagged to indicate that maintenance is being performed, also known as lock-out/tag-out procedures. Workers must be sufficiently trained to employ necessary precautions to avoid serious injury. 'On August 19, 2011, a knitting machine in an American Apparel facility in Garden Grove was undergoing maintenance, and was turned off but still connected to a power source. The machine was not tagged out, as required, and individuals were not properly trained to de-energise the machines. 'As a result, when employee Tuan Phan entered the machine cage, the machine re-started and Phan was subsequently mangled and killed by the machine.' DDA Roosevelt said California labour law was designed that employees had a healthy and safe place to work. She added: 'American Apparel failed to properly train its employees regarding safety procedures and failed to maintain a safe and healthy work environment.' The company released a statement following the agreement denying it had broken any laws concerning Mr Phan's death. The company founder Dov Charney, pictured, was sacked by the board 'for cause' after an unrelated incident . A spokesperson said: 'In August 2011, an American Apparel knitting machine operator died in a tragic industrial accident. While the company does not believe it violated any laws regarding worker safety, it has entered into an agreement with the Orange County District Attorney’s Office to resolve civil citations issued by Cal-OSHA in a manner believed to be fair and that avoids the expense of protracted litigation. 'American Apparel has been and continues to be absolutely committed to providing its employees with a safe work place and fair wages in a sweat-shop free environment.' The company agreed to pay $283,000 towards administrative and investigation costs as well as a further $566,000 in civil penalties. American Apparel recently sacked its chairman Dov Charney 'for cause' following an investigation into misconduct. Alan Mayer of American Apparel said: 'We take no joy in this, but the Board felt it was the right thing to do. 'Dov Charney created American Apparel, but the Company has grown much larger than any one individual and we are confident that its greatest days are still ahead.'","Tuan Phan was 'mangled' in a knitting machine a California factory .

"Trouble has erupted hours before the start of the Euro 2012 football tournament, with local thugs attacking English-speaking fans and hurling racist abuse at star players. About 50 hooligans punched and kicked foreign football fans speaking English and Russian as they drank in a pub in the central Polish city of Lodz. The fighting broke out after Dutch players complained they were subjected to monkey chants while training in another Polish city, where the England team is based. Fears are growing that the tournament, which starts today, could be ruined by neo-Nazi rioters in host countries Poland and Ukraine. Threatening: Supporters of Karpaty Lviv hold a German Nazi flag during a football match in Ukraine. Fears are growing that the tournament, which starts today, could be ruined by neo-Nazi rioters . Riots: Ukrainian police, pictured clashing with fans of Dynamo Kiev at a domestic cup final, are braced for trouble during Euro 2012 . The captain of the Holland squad, Mark van Bommel, claimed that thugs hurled vile insults at his black team-mates as they trained in Krakow. Manchester United player Rio Ferdinand, who was omitted from the England squad, responded to van Bommel's claims on Twitter, writing: 'Tell me I didn’t see this ... the Dutch team getting abuse already? Hope this isn’t a sign of things to come'. And Britain's sports minister Hugh Robertson called on authorities at the tournament to 'stamp down' on any racist abuse. 'Racism of any form is unacceptable on the football pitch or elsewhere,' he told the Evening Standard. Shocked: Rio Ferdinand wrote on Twitter that he hoped the abuse of Dutch players was not 'a sign of things to come' 'If it occurs I would expect the authorities to stamp down on it in the strongest possible terms.' Mr Robertson would not comment on the Dutch incident, which comes after pictures emerged of machetes and other knives confiscated from Polish fans by police. The families of two black England players, Theo Walcott and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, have decided not to travel to the competition because they feared abuse from violent and racist fans. Witnesses to the violence said masked men pulled up in cars next to a pub and attacked anyone in sight, throwing punches and kicks. The attackers were described as young men wearing club colours of local team LKS Lodz. 'When they started to hit out, we fled inside,' one victim said. 'We barricaded the entrance. 'Some of us remained outside, and they got the brunt of the attack.' Two men were injured in the attack, which happened last night. 'They forced two younger men to the ground, with multiple attackers starting to punch and kick them,' a Polish witness said. 'It was a horrible sight. I fumbled for my phone and called the police. 'They were lying motionless on the pavement. I thought they were dead. Racism fears: The families of England players Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, left, and Theo Walcott, right, have decided not to travel to Poland and Ukraine . 'After a couple of minutes, one of them started to get up, and then the second. I was very relieved.' The thugs appeared to target foreigners, and the owner of the pub refused to press charges out of fear for retaliation attacks. Before the incident, the visitors were reported to be talking and chanting in English and Russian. No English nationals were involved in the violence. The fighting followed a race row involving the Dutch team who, like England and Italy's players are training in Krakow. Kicking off: Violence and racism are already problems in Poland, where football fans are gathering for the start of Euro 2012 . Witnesses said Holland's footballers were racially abused by about 500 fans of Wisla Krakow, whose stadium is being used by national teams for training sessions. The insults began when the squad went on a two-lap jog around the pitch. The abuse was said to have been even louder on the players' second circuit. Poland's feared SWAT-style public order police squad are on high alert for rioters and thugs at Euro 2012. The elite GROM - translated as Lightning Squad - have been rehearsing anti-riot tactics and simulated hostage rescues for weeks before. Snipers on building roofs and elite officers from Poland's notorious Riot Squad and Anti-Terrorist Unit will back up the GROM officers, who wear all black. Police are equipped with portable tear gas machines, pump action shotguns with plastic baton rounds. They have been given handguns with live 9mm rounds, handcuffs, pepper spray, body armour, helmets and shields. They will also carry special pistols firing red dye capsules so rioters who get away can be identified later. All the units have carried out terrifying public shows of strength with live training assaults on buses and simulated riots. The ruthless reputation of the riot police is a hangover from Poland's communist days when they were used to viciously suppress democracy campaigners and described as the 'beating heart of the state'.

Kitted out: Police have been given guns, handcuffs, pepper spray, body armour, helmets and shields . Formidable: Polish police units have shown their strength in live training assaults on buses and simulated riots . Dutch captain Mark van Bommel . responded by telling his team-mates to pick up their kit and move to the . other end of the pitch to continue their warm-up. He warned that his players will walk off the pitch if the team is targeted by racists during the competition. The incident happened only a day after the Holland squad visited the nearby former Nazi concentration camp at Auschwitz. Van Bommel said: ‘It is a real disgrace, especially after getting back from Auschwitz to be confronted with this. Moving: The Holland squad were abused after they returned from a visit to the former Nazi concentration camp at Auschwitz . Respect: The abuse came after Dutch stars including (from left to right) Robin van Persie, Ibrahim Affelay, Nigel de Jong and Jetro Willems visited the former Nazi concentration camp at Auschwitz . ‘We will take it up with (European football's governing body) UEFA and, if it happens at matches, we will talk to the referee and ask him to take us off the field.’ In a press conference with Dutch media, some of whom did not report the chanting, the captain said: ‘You need to open your ears. ‘If you did hear it and you don’t want to hear it, that’s even worse.’ Van . Bommel was supported by the Dutch coach Bert van Marwijk, who said: ‘At . least now we know what we can encounter here,’ before adding . sarcastically: ‘Very atmospheric.’ Furious: Holland captain Mark van Bommel, left, was supported by his coach Bert van Marwijk, right, as he described the chanting as a 'real disgrace' and threatened his team could walk off the pitch . The England team is scheduled to hold a 'ticketed' session for around 3,500 fans at a stadium in Krakow today. UEFA issued a statement, which read: 'UEFA has now been made aware that there were some isolated incidents of racist chanting.' Van Bommel's Holland teammate Ibrahim Afellay told De Telegraaf newspaper that the jeers had 'saddened him'. However, the Dutch federation said it did not file a complaint to UEFA. UEFA president Michel Platini has said any player who walks off the pitch during a match without the referee's authority can expect a yellow card. 'It is a referee's job to stop the match and he is to do so if there are any problems of this kind,' Platini said. 'I count on the fans from Western and Eastern Europe to come to participate in a great football feast.' Abuse: The Dutch football team were subjected to monkey chants as they trained in Krakow . Targeted: Witnesses said Holland's footballers were racially abused by about 500 fans of Wisla Krakow, whose stadium is being used by national teams for training sessions . 'If I am here as a UEFA chairman and you all are here it is because we want this to be a football feast, not a problem.' Platini confirmed that referees had been instructed to halt matches if a player is taunted with racist chants. He . was responding to threats made by the black Manchester City and Italy . striker Mario Balotelli, who said he would leave the field if he was . abused. The sole black player on the Czech Republic's team, Theodor Gebre Selassie, said he hoped racism would not flare up in the stadiums. 'We don't know yet what the situation will be like at the stadiums,' he said, adding that he would not walk off the field. 'I'm not ready to give up. I definitely won't leave. I'll stay until they throw stones at me.' Former Arsenal and . England defender Sol Campbell last week told supporters to stay away . from the tournament because of the danger of racism and violence.

"A pair of brothers in Adelaide have created an online video of an epic Nerf gun battle that is worthy of any action movie. Posted just two days ago, the video has attracted more than 600,000 views on YouTube in 48 hours. To make it more realistic, Danny and Michael Philippou used tomato sauce as fake blood along with editing in gun sounds and sparks when a shot is fired off. Two Adelaide brothers have made a YouTube video of an epic Nerf gun battle . In just 48 hours, the three-minute video has attracted more than 600,000 views . The three-minute video starts off innocently enough with two men sitting on the living room couch playing with their mobile phones. But suddenly one of them is hit with a Nerf bullet on his chest from a gun that is off-camera. It cuts to three other man standing in the corner of the room - one of them aiming a Nerf gun at the friends sitting on the couch - who burst out laughing. The disgruntled friend is not amused, saying: 'I'm not in the mood, Michael.' The video is dubbed with gun sounds, dramatic music and tomato sauce is used as fake blood . It is also features an explosion where a bullet hits a container of petrol . A slow-motion bullet dodge - similar to the one seen in The Matrix movie - is also included . But his lack of enthusiasm is lost on the men terrorising him who continue to attack him and the other man on the couch. Suddenly more Nerf guns start to appear and more shots are fired. To throw people off the coming action sequence, one of the men becomes the voice of reason, saying: 'Alright guys, stop, someone's going to get hurt.' But the camera cuts away to one of the group who pulls out two Nerf guns as dramatic music plays to build tension. Then a spray of bullets ensues complete with James Bond-style dives behind furniture, runs across the dining room table and dramatic slides over the kitchen counter. The video also includes a slow motion bullet dodge - a nod to the iconic The Matrix movie scene - and an explosion. The two brothers who directed and edited the video were Danny and Michael Philippou . One of the five men in the video holds a comrade in his arms who is 'dying' To avenge his friend, he engages in an epic sword battle with another man . One of them accidentally sets off a gun and they use their weapons to deflect the bullets . The sword fight ends with both of them stabbing each other in the chest . The group of five then engage in hand-to-hand combat as the situation escalates along with the music. Then the ultimate weapon is brought out - a machine gun-style Nerf gun - wielded by a man imitating Arnold Schwarzenegger a la The Terminator. The group continue to cause a raucous and destruction through out the house, and the video peaks with one of them clutching a brother-in-arms covered in blood after he is shot and then dies. The friend then seeks revenge for his comrade's death. A Nerf machine gun is produced and a spray of bullets rains over the living room . Paying tribute to James Bond, the men dive over the kitchen bench and run across the dining room table . Two women - presumably residents of the home - appear and join in on the action . This pits two of the men against each other in an epic sword battle where one is armed with a Nerf blade and the other with a mop. At one point during the clash of metals, one of them sets off a Nerf gun and - using their weapons - they deflect the bullets, sending them ricocheting across the room at each other. It ends with both of them stabbing each other as two women - who are presumably the residents of the house - walk in, exclaiming about the mess. The older woman asks them what they are doing and they tell her they are 'playing Nerf'. But in a strange turn of events the woman opens her coat to reveal an arsenal of weapons and says: 'Let's dance.' It ends with both women screaming and running into the living room, brandishing weapons.","Danny and Michael Philppou with three of their friends feature in the video .

David Cameron secured a rare victory in Europe today after Britain’s Brussels commissioner was given a top finance job. The Prime Minster had been bracing himself for a fresh snub, amid suggestions that former House of Lords leader Christopher Hill would be handed a junior role in the European Commission. But the European Commission President Jean Claude Juncker this morning announced that Lord Hill would be given a new ‘Financial Services’ portfolio – giving him key powers to protect the City of London from Brussels regulations. The Tory peer was put forward by the Prime Minister to serve on Mr Juncker's new European Commission earlier this summer. But it was feared Britain would miss out on an economic role because the commission president - whose appointment was fiercely resisted by Mr Cameron - had indicated he wanted a woman to be Britain's top representative in Brussels. Mr Juncker, announcing his Commission team this morning, said: ""In these unprecedented times, Europe's citizens expect us to deliver. ‘After years of economic hardship and often painful reforms, Europeans expect a performing economy, sustainable jobs, more social protection, safer borders, energy security and digital opportunities. ‘Today I am presenting the team that will put Europe back on the path to jobs and growth.’ The new ‘Financial Stability, Financial Services and Capital Markets Union’ portfolio run by Lord Hill will be in charge of introducing new regulation for European banks. Ministers will hope to use Lord Hill’s influence in Brussels to limit the amount of EU regulation over Britain’s financial services industry. Mr Juncker wrote to Lord Hill to announce his new position. He said: 'You are becoming a Member of the new European Commission at a particularly challenging time for the European Union. 'With the start of the new Commission, we have an exceptional opportunity, but also an obligation, to make a fresh start, to address the difficult geo-political situation, to strengthen economic recovery and to build a Europe that delivers jobs and growth for its citizens. 'I want the new Commission to be a strong and political team. And I want you, with your political skills and experience, to fully play your part in this team.’ He added: 'Following our recent discussions, I would like you to be the Commissioner for Financial Stability, Financial Services and Capital Markets Union. 'In this mission letter, I set out what I expect from you as a Member of the Commission as well as specific goals for which you will be responsible for reaching during our mandate.' European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker received  David Cameron at the European Parliament in Brussels, Belgium, with a high five in July - despite the PM trying to block him getting the job . Chancellor George Osborne claimed Lord Hill's appointment was 'great news' for Britain. He wrote on Twitter: ‘Look forward to working with Lord Hill, EU financial services commissioner, to build safer & more competitive sector. Great news for UK.’ Downing Street also welcomed the announcement. The PM's spokesman said: ‘We welcome president-designate Juncker's announcement of the new European Commission-designate. ‘We have made the case for an economic portfolio for Lord Hill and I think that is what we have seen in today's announcement. ‘What we see here - unlike in the previous Commission - is a stand-alone financial services portfolio that also brings with it elements of financial stability that were previously in another portfolio. It will be this portfolio that is looking at financial services issues in the single market, but also issues such as banking union, which have always been thought of as having particular relevance to the eurozone. ‘We are seeing that being led by a Commissioner from a non-euro member-state. I think that speaks to the point that the Prime Minister and others have been making about the importance, as we go ahead with reform of the EU, of ensuring that the voice of countries that are not in euro and will not join the euro - such as the UK - are fully represented.’ But Ukip leader Nigel Farage said: ‘What a coup for Juncker - he has got an Englishman to be hangman for the British financial industry, a huge contributor to our national tax revenue. ‘Mr Cameron transferred control of Britain's financial services industry - our biggest industry - to the European Union in 2010. That process has now been completed by the appointment of a British commissioner to make sure that everything is done on an EU level. ‘It is vital to note that Lord Hill will not be acting in the interests of the British Government or the British people; he will be making a solemn pledge to act in the interests of the European Union.’","Lord Hill handed crucial 'Financial Services' portfolio in EU Commission .

"An 11-year-old girl whose lips became so chapped they bled at school is now petitioning the district to let her use lip balm. Grace Karaffa, a fifth-grader at Stuarts Draft Elementary School in Virginia, has suffered from dry lips for years and and repeatedly her requests for ChapStick have been turned down because the district considers the ointment an 'over-the-counter drug' that require's a doctor's note and must be held by the school nurse. After a particularly painful episode, when Karaffa was refused ChapStick yet again and had to wet her cracking lips in the bathroom sink, she decided it was time to take action. Scroll down for video . Taking a stand: 11-year-old Grace Karaffa is fighting her elementary school for the right to use ChapStick to treat her dry lips . She started a petition which received over 300 signatures, and presented it in front of the August County school board last week. Grace asked the board to consider changing the policy, calling it 'inappropriate'. Her father, David Karaffa, serves as Beverly Manor district supervisor. 'I don't believe there is anything inside a generic ChapStick that would be classified as a drug,' he told Fox News. 'We would like the exception to be made so that kids in school can carry ChapStick.' After her speech, the board cross-examined Karaffa with one member pointing out that the lip balm could be considered a distraction in class. Expression: Grace started a petition and got over 300 signatures. She presented her case to the school board last week . 'She said, ""I think it would be more distracting to have bleeding lips while I'm doing my work,""' Mr Karaffa recalled. 'That ended that line of questioning.' The school board continues to review Grace's petition. In the meantime she plans to send thank you letters to the entire board, with a ChapStick tube included. Assistant Superintendent George Earhart says the policy concerning lip balm was put in place after a disease outbreak. 'Our policy is not to be so restrictive. It is really a protection for the students,' he told the News-Leader. Elementary School students can still use ChapStick, but they must first obtain a doctor's note, and then it must be kept in the nurse's office and applied there. The school shares a space with a pre-kindergarden, and there are also fears that the tubes could be accidentally passed to the small children.","Grace Karaffa, 11, has been denied ChapStick at school for years, and one time her lips became so dry they bled .

"Accused: PC Katie Murray, 29, allegedly used the police database to obtain sensitive information on Cregan while he still on the run . A policewoman leaked confidential details about the police manhunt for one-eyed mass killer Dale Cregan to her family and a former lover while he was still on the run, a court heard today. PC Katie Murray, 29, allegedly used the police database to obtain sensitive information on the quadruple murderer and then used texts and the 'WhatApp' messaging service to pass it on to older sibling Lindsey. The jury heard she had been in a relationship with cannabis dealer Jason Lloyd, 43, and also sent confidential information to him - even though she knew he was in contact with Cregan's family. Cregan, 30, was found guilty of four counts of murder last June - including that of gang rivals David Short, 42, and his son Mark, 23 and two unarmed police officers during 42 days on the run. When WPCs Fiona Bone and Nicola Hughes were shot dead by Cregan in an ambush, Murray sent sister Lindsey Murray, 33, a picture and the name of one of the dead officers three hours before she was formally identified, the jury was told. In a WhatsApp message between the pair, Lindsey Murray said: 'Oh my God, I can't believe this s***, you better come here after work and fill me in' and Katie replied: 'I don't really know anything. He he'. The officer, who has been with Greater Manchester Police since 2004, later filmed Cregan arriving at Newton Heath police station for interview and could be heard repeating 'Oh my God, oh my God'. Her hospital worker sister was said to have passed on confidential information given to her to friends. Eight days after Cregan carried out the second of his four murders, she allegedly told a friend: 'Talking to Kate last night, I know the full story about Cregan x'. 'Keep it to yourself though. They (police) are all targets our Kate said,' she added. At Minshull Street Crown Court, Manchester, Katie and Lindsey Murray, both of Droylsden, deny a charge of a misconduct in a public office. The police officer also denies a data protection offence. The jury was told the WPC had once been in a relationship with cannabis dealer Jason Lloyd, 43, and she also used the force database to get confidential information to him about police investigations into his criminality over a 20 month period. She was said said to have provided him with details of investigations into his criminal associates. On trial: PC Murray's sister Lindsey, left, also passed on the information about mass killer Cregan, right, she received from her sister to friends, the court heard . Nick Clarke QC prosecuting said: 'In addition to providing information to Jason Lloyd. Katie Murray has also misused police systems to gain and provide information to friends and family members without any lawful policing purposes. 'Lindsey has requested Katie to check police systems and provide information to her regarding other individuals and incidents known to her. There was no proper policing purpose for such inquiries and no legitimate basis for the dissemination of the information.' Alleged leaks by Katie Murray included details of the investigations into the murders by Cregan of Mark Short, 28, who was shot dead at The Cotton Tree Pub in Ashton-under-Lyne on May 25 2012 and father David Short, 46, who was killed in a gun and grenade attack at his home on August 10 2012. Mr Clarke added: 'PC Murray had no role in investigating the shootings. Nevertheless she took a particular and persistent interest in the police log in relation to that incident and in the same period she was in regular contact with Jason Lloyd.' When Cregan and another suspect were initially arrested and questioned and bailed on their return from Thaliand on June 12 2012, Katie reviewed the arrests and looked at their custody records before making contact with Lloyd. On the day of David Short's murder, Katie checked the incident log on several occasions before being in contact with Lloyd nine times at around the same time - even while the police screens were open in front of her, said the QC. He added: 'Lindsey is also very interested in the information that can be obtained from Katie. Examination of call data, text and 'What App' messages between Katie, Lindsey and associates has established that Katie divulged to her sister information regarding the murder investigations including the hunt for Dale Cregan and his associates, their arrest and custody process. 'Lindsey was aware that Jason Lloyd was in contact with the Cregan family.' Murders: The killing of PC Nicola Hughes, left, and PC Fiona Bone, right, in an ambush my Dale Cregan shocked Britain - and before they were identified Katie Murray allegedly shared a photo and name of one of them . Mr Clarke said when the two policewomen were killed on September 18 2012, Katie was not assigned to the investigation team - yet sent a picture of WPC Nicola at 12.53pm. Chief Constable Sir Peter Fahy did not formally name the officer until 3.53pm during a news conference. The prosecutor said: 'Not only did she constantly monitor the incident logs and activity as shown on the police computers, she was also contacting her sister then almost immediately afterwards Lloyd. The court heard Katie also shared information about another possible murder not related to Cregan and checked up on her boyfriend's ex-lover. She is alleged to have tipped Lloyd off on proposed police raids of his cannabis factory based in a disused mill in Stockport which had been fitted with fake walls to make crops almost impossible to find. The link between Murray and Lloyd, also of Droylsden, was only discovered when police seized his mobile phone following the Cregan murders and texts on his mobile phone was examined. When police raised Katie's home, they found an envelope of letters written to her from Lloyd which she kept in the drawer of her bedside cabinet. Lloyd, from Droyslden denies conspiracy to commit misconduct in a public office and separate offences of possessing a prohibited firearm, possessing ammunition without a certificate and possessing ammunition with intent to endanger life.

"Ed Miliband's hopes of a Labour majority will evaporate if Scotland leaves the UK, new analysis reveals today. Labour is on course to win the 2015 election with a majority of 32 seats in the Commons, according according to a poll - but only because of Scottish MPs who will be given the boot in the event of independence. Now ministers have been called on to explain how they would respond if Scotland votes for independence, as Britain is faced with a constitutional crisis at the next election. Scroll down for video . The . validity of the 2015 General Election is being called into question . because a Labour win means, led by Ed Miliband (pictured) they'd be in . charge of a 'zombie government' in power thanks to Scottish MPs . How Labour could miss out on a majority if Scotland goes it alone . Without its Scottish MPs, Labour will be three seats . short of a majority and there will be another hung parliament. The poll was compiled by John Curtice, professor of politics at Strathclyde University, for the Independent. He said Scotland could be critical to Labour’s ability to win an overall majority. In May 2010 Labour won 41 seats in Scotland, the Lib Dems 11, the SNP six while the Conservatives secured just one MP. If the latest opinion polls are repeated at the general election on May 7, 2015, Labour could win another five seats north of the border. Currently, . Scottish voters are expected to be able to take part next . May, meaning Labour could win a majority thanks to its dominance of . Scottish constituencies. By contrast, the Tories have only one Scottish MP. But if the country votes for independence, all Scottish MPs would be swept away in March 2016, when Scotland would become an independent nation. There have been calls for Scottish voters to be excluded from the general election if they decided to vote yes for independence in next week's referendum. Some MPs have also suggested they will call for legislation to be introduced to postpone the election in the event of a yes vote. It would be the first time since 1940, a year into the second world war, that a general election would have been postponed. If the country votes for independence, all Scottish MPs would be swept away in March 2016, when Scotland would become an independent nation . The option has not yet been discussed with ministers, Whitehall sources say, but . one official told the paper: 'It is too sensitive before the . referendum, but we couldn’t duck it any longer if there were a Yes . vote.' Former . Labour MP Eric Joyce, now an independent, said the election would . ‘surely be cancelled’, adding: ‘An English parliamentary election would . be an entirely new proposition for voters south of the new border. ‘There . could meanwhile be no question that, for example, Labour might win a UK . election by a small majority, only to see a Tory government and prime . minister take power in England without an election once the Scots had . departed. 'Moreover, . the notion of Scottish MPs voting on England-only matters while the . whole parliament was consumed by Scots extracting themselves from the . union would be nonsensical and unmanageable.’ Angus . Robertson, SNP leader at Westminster, called last year for a delay in . the election to allow the negotiations on separation to take place. David .

The . three Westminster party leaders released a joint statement  declaring . that it was time to go to Scotland to bolster the faltering 'No' campaign and ordered the Scottish flag to be raised over Downing Street.

"For the first time in half a century the Colorado River kissed the Sea of Cortez in Mexico this May, providing photographer Pete McBridge a glimpse into the past of an American continent untouched by man's meddling. The river, which flows high up in the Rocky Mountains of the United States, winds its way 1,400 miles south. Over the past hundred or so years its journey has been dammed and changed more than a dozen times to feed and irrigate cities across the West. Only 10 percent of the mighty river even reaches Mexico, but this March, the US and Mexican governments made the decision to unleash the Morelos Dam across the border and release billions of gallons into now dry riverbeds - restoring the Colorado River Delta to life. Restoration: Its course has been altered many times over the past century - but in May the Colorado River reached the Sea of Cortez off the coast of Mexico for the first time in 50 years . McBride and writer Rowan Jacobsen decided to traverse the now restored artery on paddle boards, watching as the so-called 'pulse flow' bored down the dusty riverbeds that once was the natural escape for the Colorado River as it made its way through Mexico. 'Over eight weeks, a 105,392-acre-foot pulse flow of water—about 34 billion gallons—would pour through Morelos and down the dry channel,' wrote Jacobsen in Outside Magazine. 'The idea was to mimic the dynamics of the Colorado's historical spring flood, timed to coincide with the germination of willow and cottonwood seeds.' Peter McBride was astounded by the success as 'it kissed the sea this spring thanks to the hard work of many who lifted the gates of the last of 12 major dams on the river to release an experimental pulse flow across the parched delta. Opened: The Morelos Dam on the Colorado River is wide open, allowing river water to move due south down the historic river channel some 100 miles to the Sea of Cortez. Typically, the dam gates are sealed tight diverting the last of the river into the Reforma Canal on the left of the image. Once-in-a-lifetime: Across the delta, people came out to see the rare sight - water in the Colorado. These children played in the shallows the entire time we stopped to eat a snack during the first SUP crossing of the delta. Damming the Colorado with their butts: Members of McBrides expedition shore up the Colorado River pulse with their backsides for their own amusement in Mexico . Never-seen-before: Passer-by marvel at water in the Colorado River at the last major bridge in the delta roughly 50 miles from the sea. Return of nature: Within hours of water reaching the community of San Luis, just over the US/ Mexican border, fisherman were reeling in carp and more . Journey: Members of McBride's team paddling the crest of the historic 2014 pulse flow across the dry Colorado River Delta 55 miles below the Morelos Dam. The pulse flow was part of a bi-national agreement for restoration . 'It was temporary and puny in the scheme of things - less than 1% of the river - but magical as it showed the world how we can restore natural habitats if we try. 'The goal was to not only restore the river, but native vegetation and fisheries which ultimately restore us, too.' Enough water to supply over 200,000 homes for a year was released on March 23 in an effort to revive trees, wildlife and aquatic life that have perished since the delta dried up decades ago. Conservationists say it'll be years before they see the environmental effects of the water streaming through, but residents in the town of San Luis Rio Colorado in the Mexican state of Sonora have frolicked in the water and marveled at the river when the flow started. Get ready: The gates of the Morelos dam are typically closed but were opened for a historic pulse flow moving its way across the dry Colorado River Delta . Alberto Santos crosses water in what is normal a dry riverbed Wednesday, March 26, 2014, in San Luis Rio Colorado, Mexico . Mexican cowboys celebrated the 2014 historic pulse flow of Colorado River Delta with laughter, galloping and even dancing horses. Team paddle-board: (l-r) Pete McBride, Juan Butron, Sam Walton, Osvel Hinojosa, Rowan Jacobsen, Fred Philips -- during the 2014 pulse flow . It's a feat that the water released in March  continued to flow through to May, said Sally Spener, a spokeswoman for the International Boundary and Water Commission. Spener has said that the success of the project will inform future collaborations between the U.S. and Mexico. 'It's been very exciting for all of us to track the pulse flow as it has moved downstream to parts of the Colorado River channel that have been dry for years. To say that we reconnected the river with the sea is especially gratifying,' said Edward Drusina, U.S. Commissioner of the International Boundary and Water Commission.","Photographer Pete McBride followed the Colorado River as its original course was restored for the first time in 50 years .

Rescued: Their victim, a mother, had been kept captive for two month inside their trailer . She was only allowed out to cook and clean for the couple, and was also restrained with bungee cords and zip ties and forced to have sex with them, court papers say. The woman was only saved when Tooley's ex-husband, Ron Higgs, was invited over to the trailer last Thursday when the couple needed money. Higgs said he was dumbfounded when House casually said to him: 'I've got a girl back here in a cage.' 'She had a t-shirt on, and that was it,' Higgs told WFIE. 'She had a leather belt, like a dog collar on. Every night, they locked her in there. No food, no water.' Initially he thought the woman was in on the plan, but the following day, when he was still at the home, she told him she was being held there and pleaded with him to help her escape. 'That's when she told me on the second night with tears running down her eyes, ""Please, do not leave here with out me,"" he said. 'And I promised her, ""If I have to give my life to get you out of here I will"".'

"The male in question has been described as a cheery chap wearing a blue jacket and red hat with a ‘smiley and hairy expression’. But this is no ordinary missing persons case - because police are investigating the overnight theft of a 3ft garden gnome from a pensioner’s ornamental front path. Stanley Hall, 81, had placed the giant gnome named ‘Happy Harry’ beside the doorstep alongside scores of other ornaments to cheer up his neighbours in Accrington, Lancashire. Gone: The 3ft gnome called 'Happy Harry' (bottom right) was stolen from this home in Accrington, Lancashire. This photograph was taken before the theft . However the widower was shocked to wake . up one morning to find the £25 statuette had gone missing - and called . in police. It is thought the gnome may have been taken for a prank or to . sell on. Retired engineer Mr Hall said: ‘I can’t believe that someone would do this - and I can only presume that whoever has done this have planned it in advance. ‘I can’t imagine that they would want to walk through a town centre carrying a giant gnome. I just don’t know why they would steal him. If it was youngsters perhaps it was for a joke or prank. ‘If someone older, perhaps there is a black market for these things but why risk selling Harry off for a tenner and perhaps face the courts if they get found out?’ Plea: Stanley Hall, 81, is pictured outside his home in Accrington with a sign made by a local woman saying: 'Hello, I'm Happy Harry, welcome to my garden' ‘One of my neighbours was so upset at the theft she actually rang the police before me. They were so upset. We are quite a tight-knit group here. 'Perhaps there is a black market for these things but why risk selling Harry off for a tenner and perhaps face the courts if they get found out?' Stanley Hall . ‘The thing is we never have any trouble around here because everyone is elderly. I just want these people to bring Harry home. ‘I don’t need to speak to them - they can just bring it back during the evening when it is dark and that will be the end of it.’ Mr Hall bought the gnome last March from a local supermarket to add to his 100-strong collection of ornamental dragons, pandas, dogs, trolls and Buddha figures. Police investigation: The widower was shocked to find the £25 statuette had gone missing during the night . He added: ‘I collect ornaments for the simple reason that there are a lot of elderly people around here. There are at least four people in their 90s and three in their 80s. 'One of my neighbours was so upset at the theft she actually rang the police before me. They were so upset. We are quite a tight-knit group here' Stanley Hall . ‘It makes them smile every time they walk past and look at my front door and see all my gnomes - especially “Happy Harry” smiling back at them. ‘One of the ladies here even made a sign saying “Hello, I’m Happy Harry, welcome to my garden.” That is the whole point of it. They come past and they always have a smile for him. ‘Happy Harry waves and sometimes you see them wave back as the go by. Since my wife died three years ago, I didn’t have to answer to anyone querying what I buy. Plea: Lancashire Constabulary urged anyone with information about who is responsible to contact the force . ‘My eldest daughter often comes in and says: “What have you bought now?” I say: “Did you see my two new gnomes looking out the window at you?” She just laughs and that is what it is all about. 'We are aware of the incident and we are investigating. I urge anyone with information about who is responsible to contact us' Lancashire Constabulary spokesman . ‘Harry just makes me smile and is one of 100 ornaments. I noticed he was missing on Saturday morning. I opened the door and thought something was wrong here and realised he wasn’t there. ‘I just felt sorry for people who have to steal things like that. I want Happy Harry back, not for me but for the people. When they come past, they got used to seeing him. ‘It’s like having a missing person in the area. I will get another gnome but it won’t be the same and it looks like I will have to chain him up.’ A Lancashire Constabulary spokesman said: ‘We are aware of the incident and we are investigating. I urge anyone with information about who is responsible to contact us.’","Stanley Hall, 81, had placed giant gnome alongside his other ornaments .

The Yeshiva Centre in Bondi erected the concrete wall in front of its college, which houses kindergarten to Year 12 students as well as a synagogue, classes for adults and a community kitchen. Whilst Director Rabbi Dovid ­Slavin has been working towards breaking down barriers, he says 'building walls is the unfortunate reality' in Australia today. A Jewish school in Sydney's eastern suburbs is constructing a bomb proof wall in front of its college . The Yeshiva Centre in Bondi has erected a concrete wall  which is home students from kindergarten to Year 12 . The wall is designed to withstand the force of a car bomb left outside the Jewish centre . The construction of the wall was funded by private donations and $519,000 granted by the federal government . The construction of the wall was funded by private donations and $519,000 granted through the federal government's 2012 $20 million Secure Schools Program, reported the Wentworth Courier. It is understood the wall, designed with the help from Israeli expertise, can withstand the force of a car bomb outside the centre. While it is believed the rising anti-semitism in the area prompted the construction of the bomb proof wall, Rabbi Slavin declined to comment further as he has concerns the drastic security measures may add fuel to the fire. He did however say: 'what we're trying to do is keep the children and the families safe.' 'But our concerns talking about security may compromise what we're actually trying to achieve.' This being a harmonious community through breaking down barriers. 'Yet building walls is the unfortunate reality,' Rabbi Slavin said. CEO of the NSW Jewish Board of Deputies Vic Alhadeff told Daily Mail Australia that it was against policy to comment on security matters. Whilst Director Rabbi Dovid ­Slavin has been working towards breaking down barriers, he says 'building walls is the unfortunate reality' in Australia today . The Yeshiva Centre was established in 1956 as a synagogue, classes for adults and a community kitchen . This comes after a group of teenagers allegedly launched a tirade of anti-Semitic slurs when they boarded a bus in Randwick, Sydney's east, in August. Children as young as five were among the busload terrorised on  when the young men dressed in baggy pants and t-shirts boarded the bus at Randwick, just before 4pm. Several students made frantic calls to their parents after the youths started yelling 'kill the Jews' and 'free Palestine', and 'Heil Hitler'. A more recent incident involves residents in Bondi receiving anti-Semitic flyers in their letterboxes which urge 'white Australia' to 'wake up'. The letters claim 'the Jews' encourage 'race mixing' and that they 'own' Hollywood and the majority of western media.","The Yeshiva Centre in Bondi has erected a concrete wall in front of its college .

"A teenager who appeared on national television wearing the logo of listed terrorist organisation Islamic State appeared in court on Wednesday charged with affray and the stalking and intimidation of a cleaner at a shopping centre. Sulaymin Khalid, 19, a part-time labourer from Regents Park in Sydney's west, was at Bankstown local court when he faced the charges. His look was a far cry from how he appeared on SBS's Insight show on August 12 when he wore a black jacket which featured the Islamic State logo and black hat over his hair. To court he wore a blue and white checked shirt and khaki green trousers, his black curly hair slicked back in a ponytail. Scroll down for video . Sulayman Khalid, 19, appeared at Bankstown local court on Wednesday where he faced charges of stalking and intimidating a shopping centre cleaner . Khalid previously appeared on SBS Insight wearing the the Islamic State symbol adorned to a black sleeveless jacket as he sat in the audience . Khalid, who goes by the Islamic name Abu Bakr, was accompanied in court by his lawyer Zali Burrows and around six family members and friends. They walked into court number five after the morning hearing had begun and were there for two minutes as Ms Burrows contested the facts of the charges. The court was adjourned until October 29. In court all Ms Burrows said of her client was 'he is in the courtroom today'. Outside court she told Daily Mail Australia, when questioned about Khalid's support of the Islamic State, 'why don’t you ask him about it?'. When Daily Mail Australia asked Khalid outside of court why he wore the Islamic state flag on television he said 'want to race me?' before running off down the street with a friend . Khalid's lawyer Zali Burrows (pictured) contested the facts of the charges during the two minute hearing . ASIO cancelled Khalid's passport in December when he was identified as one of 20 men who hold 'an extreme ideology'. When Daily Mail Australia asked Khalid outside of court why he wore the Islamic state flag on television he said 'want to race me?' and then he ran off down the street with a friend. His father said 'I don't want to talk about it'. Police allege Khalid approached a 43-year-old cleaner  at Bankstown shopping centre before threatening and intimidating him as part of an alleged 'religious hate crime'. Khalid was arrested at about 2.45pm on Friday 15 August in Stuart Lane, Bankstown. However, he claimed he was simply walking through the shopping centre after seeing a film with a friend when the cleaner – an Iraqi Christian - made a comment about his vest which was adorned with the Islamic State flag, the Sydney Morning Herald reports. Khalid, who goes by the Islamic name Abu Bakr, was accompanied in court by six family members and friends . The cleaner apparently objected to the symbol he was wearing and Khalid claims the cleaner actually threatened him. Khalid has been charged with two offences that allegedly occured between 9pm and 9:30 pm on August 10, including an affray. Police allege he threatened cleaner Petrus Matlub with unlawful violence 'by conduct such that a person of reasonable soundness if present at the scene would have feared for their safety'. The second charge against Khalid is for stalking or intimidating 'with the intention of causing Petrus Matlub physical or mental harm'. ASIO cancelled Khalid's passport in December when he was identified as one of 20 men who hold 'an extreme ideology' The 'black flag of jihad' as used by various organisations since the late 1990s consists of a white-on-black shahada . Khalid is under strict bail conditions. He must report to police every Monday, Wednesday and Friday between 8am and 8pm, he must be of good behaviour and must not go within 50 metres of Bankstown shopping centre . Khalid is under strict bail conditions. He must report to police every Monday, Wednesday and Friday between 8am and 8pm. He must be of good behaviour and he must not enter Bankstown shopping centre or go within 50 metres of the shopping centre. He is also on a night time curfew and must stay indoors between 8pm and 7am unless accompanied by a parent or guardian. Ms Burrows told Daily Mail Australia last month that Khalid is simply a 'young kid who is passionate about injustice'. She argued a ‘verbal dispute’ between two people wouldn’t normally be treated with such important by police. She said there is a ‘witch hunt’ against Khalid since he appeared on the SBS Insight show on August 12 wearing the Islamic State symbol. 'Let’s hope the call to press charges does not further fuel the angry and dangerous mob who are bombarding my client and self with threats,' she said.

"It might be hard to imagine Lady Gaga blending in with anything other than a space ship let alone a classical painting, however for one artist this was a clear vision. Multimedia producer Eisen Bernard Bernado has created quirky artwork that re-imagines fine art with the faces of modern day celebrities as they feature on the cover of popular magazines. Eisen, 28, from Los Baños, Philippines, has created the clever works for his series called Mag + Art, seeing Angelina Jolie take the place of Venus in Botticelli's classic painting the Birth of Venus and Adele fits perfectly into Da Vinci's Mona Lisa. Angelina Jolie is re-imagined as Botticelli's classic painting the Birth of Venus . In Vermeer's Girl with a Pearl Earring, Keira Knightley evolves her innocent persona by smoking a cigarette on the cover of Interview magazine. Far from just an amusing coincidence, Eisen says it is an obvious combination and that many publications take influence from classical art.

'I feel that a lot of magazine covers are inspired directly as well as indirectly by classical paintings. The similarities and references can be observed.' The Philippino artist also uses his pieces to hail the lost art of printed publications. 'My art is my way of comparing and contrasting modern and classical aesthetics. Also, in this day when everyone is saying that ""print media is dead"", it is a way of promoting the print medium to the internet generation'.

Lady Gaga makes an unlikely Athenais by John William Godward (left) and Lana Del Rey blends into The Cripple by John Currin (right) Miranda Kerr makes a suitable temptress in Adam and Eve by Lucas Cranach the Elder . Despite his work's seamless appearance he says that his choices are not always clear cut and it can take several attempts to get it right. 'It is like I am assembling a jigsaw puzzle. It's trial and error.. Most are just a product of a beautiful accident. All of them are unplanned and I'm always surprised with the output. I just wanted every piece to evoke a humorous or fascinating effect on the viewer.

Eisen posts all his works on Tumblr and has received a mixed response about his work. 'Some people think my work is genius because the idea is very simple, but no-one has done anything like this before. 'The works also challenge the audience to compare and contrast classical and modern aesthetics.' As with many artists, Eisen's work is met with as much criticism as it is praise with some critics claiming it is blasphemous to original artwork. 'But for some people what I did is sacrilegious, and they think I am disrespecting the works of the masters, which is not the case. 'I'm fond of homage, similarities and references in movies, music, and other art forms to classical works and that's what I wanted to explore.'

"A massive search for a three-year-old boy who fell into a storm drain in Melbourne has been suspended until Thursday morning. Victoria's emergency services had been looking for the toddler since Wednesday afternoon after a witness reported seeing a child floating down an open drain on Lonsdale Street, Dandenong - in Melbourne's south-east - just before 3pm. Crews - including the Country Fire Authority and Victoria Police - launched air and water searches for the boy, holding fears he may have drowned. Scroll down for video . The boy was last seen about 2.55pm in Lonsdale Street in Dandenong - south-east of Melbourne . It is believed the boy was playing in Rotary Park in Dandenong with his family . Initial reports indicated the boy had been washed into an open drain and into the creek . Police said it was unlikely the child would have survived the creek's fast-flowing current and chilly temperatures. During the search, an officer was knocked off his feet by the current when he was wading through waters up to his knees. 'Unfortunately one couldn't expect that a small child would have much hope in such fast flowing water,' Senior Sergeant Phil Hulley told the Herald Sun. The drain - which leads into Dandenong Creek - is usually not full of water but since heavy rain fell hit the Victorian capital on Tuesday, it has become a rapid waterway. A witness alerted emergency services when they saw a child floating in the water after falling into an open drain, according to The Age. It is believed the boy was playing at Dandenong's Rotary Park along with his family when he went missing. Crowds have gathered around the search area as CFA authorities and police continue their efforts . The boy's family are 'very distraught' and are awaiting news at the Dandenong police station . A witness reported he saw a child floating down the stream way which leads into Dandenong Creek . The creek flows into Melbourne's south-east suburbs and makes it way into Port Phillip Bay - west of Dandenong . As a crowd started gathering at the banks of the drain, the boy's family - who are believed to originally be from Afghanistan and new to the area - were swiftly taken to the police station to await news. They are now receiving counselling. Residents - who were also lined up on a bridge over the area - joined in with the search efforts. Earlier on Wednesday, Dandenong Superintendent David Clayton said the boy's parents were 'very distraught' and situation was 'grim'. 'You couldn't imagine the pain the parents are experiencing at the moment with their child missing, presumably in the creek,' he told reporters at the scene. 'Obviously the child has been in the water for a long period of time, we believe. 'So it's very concerning for the parents and obviously they're very distraught.' Emergency services are out looking for the boy this afternoon . Search crews are desperately looking for the little boy . Police have asked parents to be vigilant around fast-flowing water. 'Our message would be to parents, to be very aware that there is fast-flowing water and they need to be vigilant with their children around obviously fast-flowing water,' Supt Clayton said. A spokesman for Victoria Police said they were 'throwing everyone we have at this'. The Age reported that police are searching along the banks of the creek near Webster Street and the Princes Highway bridge. Air searches are being conducted over the creek that runs through Melbourne's south-east suburbs to Port Phillip Bay - which lies west of Dandenong. A helicopter was seen circling the area and a dog squad was also involved in the search. 'The search is quite extensive. We've got a large number of police personnel here and SES assisting with a line search,' Supt Clayton said. Ambulance Victoria told Daily Mail Australia they were on stand-by. A flood warning was issued for the creek by the Bureau of Meteorology at 11am. The Dandenong Creek is raging after a day of very heavy rain in Melbourne .

"Even when they’re just a few days old, it’s wise to take care with crocodiles. So this zookeeper kept fingers well out of the way as these rare Siamese crocs were shown off at the Crocodiles of the World attraction in Oxfordshire. Eight were hatched in all, each with a set of teeth which can already deliver a sharp bite. The birth single-handedly boosted the world's population of Siamese crocodiles by almost 2 per cent, as the endangered species is rarer than the Giant panda. Scroll down for video . Handle with care! These Siamese crocodiles have been born at Crocodiles of the World in Oxfordshire, single-handedly boosting the critically-endangered global population of the species by almost 2 per cent . There are only 500 left in the world and they have been listed as ‘critically endangered’ by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Crocodile breeder Shaun Foggett launched the Oxfordshire tourist venue in 2011 by importing a 10ft male Siamese crocodile named Hugo and a female called Rebecca from zoos in France and Denmark. They paired up in spring this year, and a few weeks later staff saw Rebecca start to build a nest out of soil and bark chippings in her enclosure. She laid 16 fertile eggs which were very carefully taken from the nest by staff and placed in an incubator for the next 80 days. Of the 16 large eggs, eight of them hatched over a four-day period. The other eight failed to hatch. Just a few days old, the babies are now 10ins long and weigh 2oz each. Rare: Fewer than 500 Siamese crocs are in the wild . The baby crocs are being looked after by staff and fed a diet of insects such as locusts and crickets. This will progress to raw meat including chicken and beef in the next few weeks. They will be put into their own enclosure at the attraction but Mr Foggett hopes in the future they will be used to set up a breeding programme in Cambodia, home to the wild population of 500. Shaun, 35, said: 'Siamese crocodiles are critically endangered, three times more endangered than the Giant panda. 'They are over-hunted for the illegal skin trade and they are suffering from habitat loss due to the building of hydroelectric dams. 'They are so threatened that we wanted to give the eggs the best possible chance of hatching by incubating them in controlled conditions and a steady temperature of 30C. 'This is the first time this species has been bred in the UK. We are delighted that we have boosted their worldwide numbers. Adult Siamese crocodiles grow to 10ft in length and reach breeding age by seven years old. They often develop brightly-coloured patterns in their scales which makes them more striking than other species. They are also less aggressive, with attacks on humans more or less unheard of. To some their name may wrongly conjur images of 'Siamese' or conjoined twins - it simply refers to the part of the world from which they originate. Mr Foggett's business is home to 126 crocodiles and alligators from 14 species and attracts 30,000 visitors a year. The married father-of-three has always been fascinated by crocodiles and began keeping reptiles from the age of 15. After studying the husbandry of crocodiles, he began to keep them privately before selling his family home to build and open the zoo in 2011.","Birth has single-handedly increased the global population by 2 per cent .

"Residents in a seaside town had to be evacuated after a traditionally built cob cottage collapsed during renovation work yesterday. One wall of the mud and straw-built terraced house fell into the street in Dawlish, Devon, as scaffolding surrounding it buckled and fell. Emergency services were called but despite the scale of the damage, no-one was injured in the incident which happened at 4pm yesterday. The traditionally-built cob cottage in Dawlish, Devon, buckled and collapsed into the street yesterday afternoon . The narrow street in the seaside wall was rendered impassable after the side of the terraced house fell away . How it looked before: The cob cottages in Dawlish have typically thick walls - they're often 24 inches thick . It emerged today that builders had been working to repair a crack in the front wall of the house, which is home to a couple in their 30s with children, who were out at the time. Jason Sandland, an architectural surveyor who lives in the street near the town centre, said: 'The scaffolding twisted and collapsed onto the road. 'Luckily there was no-one on the street, which is usually quite busy.' He added: 'Cob is usually a good material for building but it can dry out if covered with the wrong render.' Emergency services attended after a neighbour called 999. A Devon and Cornwall police spokesman said: 'There was no one in the building or on the scaffolding at the time which was very lucky.' The cob cottage in Dawlish is the second such building to collapse in under a week - last Thursday a 400-year-old cob cottage up the coast in East Budleigh, Devon, buckled. In that incident, the owner's father described how he fled to safety minutes before the ancient property fell to the floor. John Timms said he was in his son's house in the he heard 'cracking noises' that got louder and louder. 'The noises became louder so I got out,' he said.  'Then around 20 minutes later the roof and walls came down, as if in slow motion. 'The cob just failed.' Scene of the collapse: Engineers from Teignbridge Council assess the damage from a cherry-picker . Two builders who were working in the East Budleigh property at the time also escaped before the cream cottage crumpled. Mr Timms, whose family have been offered accommodation by friends following the incident, said: 'Until we can get inside we won't know what's left intact and what isn't. 'It could have been a lot worse - we're just so thankful that no-one was hurt or worse.' The word cob comes from an old English word meaning round lump, and hands are still used to mix together the various materials to form cob when it's used in house-building today. Most often found in Wales and the south west in Britain, cob houses and farm buildings date back to the 14th century, and are usually made of a mix of natural building materials including clay, earth, straw, sand and water. Known for being fireproof, cheap to build, and relative flexibility in areas of seismic activity, cob buildings typically have 24-inch thick walls which insulate the building during winter and keep it cool during the summer, with deep-set windows and doors. Poor people in Tudor times often built themselves homes out of cob, as it was cheaper than the timber framed homes of the period. Their homes were often one-roomed cottages, topped by a thatched roof, with a beaten earth floor. While it is similar to adobe, cob is different because it can be used in cold and wet climates - its porosity lends itself to cool damp climates.","Traditionally built cob cottage in Dawlish, Devon, collapsed at 4pm yesterday .

"Two Victorian police officers found themselves operating slightly outside of their job description this morning when a woman in labour arrived at the station for assistance. Constable Laura Wood and Senior Constable Peter Evans quickly rushed to the assistance of the woman who had entered her final stages of labour en route to the hospital. The woman's husband and toddler son looked on as the woman gave birth in the middle of the station car park, much to the surprise of the assisting officers. Sergeant Max Walker said that the officers had just started their morning shift when the woman came in. Surprised Victorian Police constables delivered a baby girl this morning at Springvale Police Station . 'This is an unusual event, but a nice way to start the day,' said Sergeant Walker. 'The woman had been screaming at her husband to pull over, telling him that the baby was coming now,' 'I've been doing this job for 36 years, and while this kind of thing happens every now and then, it's not normally happening at the actual station,' 'It's nice to do something positive to assist the local community'. Sergeant Walker said that Constable Wood and Senior Constable Evans were a bit shocked when the woman came in, but their training quickly kicked in. The officers quickly sprung into action to help deliver the baby girl . 'They went straight into training mode,' said Sergeant Walker. 'We're all qualified in Senior First Aid, and of course they took into account the welfare of the mother and child.' The baby girl was delivered via a normal birth but was found not to be breathing. 'We offered reassurance to the mother, and had Melbourne Ambulance Service on the phone,' 'They were excellent and provided all the instructions the constables needed to help her.' The baby girl and her mother were taken to Dandenong Hospital for monitoring . The constables checked the baby's airways and the girl was soon breathing. An ambulance arrived from Monash Health and the mother and her new baby girl were taken to Dandenong Hospital for monitoring. Victorian Police have dealt with a similar situation before in the rural town of Ferntree Gully. In 1997 Jacqui Walker's son Connor was born at the Mooroolbark Police Station when she was sent home from the hospital after being induced at about midnight. 'After dropping off my daughter to my mothers house, I insisted on continuing on to hospital which was about 25 minutes away,' Ms. Walker said. 'My mother begged me to stay and offered to call and ambulance but I was in second stage labour and only focused on getting to hospital,' 'When I passed the police station in Mooroolbark, I needed to push so I yelled to my husband that he needed to pull over. The police station was the only thing open at 2am!' Ms. Walker  had four police officers helping her through the stressful process, for which she is incredibly thankful. 'I had some stroking my hair and saying reassuring words, and others ready for action. Gloves and a blanket came out and I would have been there less than five minutes before my son was born in the car. The ambulance arrived about five minutes later and we went on to the hospital,' she said. 'I saw on the news the next day how absolutely chuffed the officers were at being involved in the birth of my son. I am forever grateful to them'. While babies decide when and where they will come, Sergeant Walker was certainly not expecting one on his shift. 'I've seen a lot of things in my years,' said Sergeant Walker. 'But nothing like this. Nobody to my knowledge has ever given birth at the station before'. The baby girl and her mother have been reported to be doing well and resting normally.

"Andrew Ferguson has admitted using threatening and abusive behaviour after posting a series of tweets about his school earlier this summer . A teenager threatened to massacre pupils at his high school in a series of sickening online messages, a court has heard. Andrew Ferguson took to Twitter threatening to take a blade into St Mungo's High School in Falkirk, Stirlingshire earlier this summer. He also tweeted that he hoped that the family of the school's deputy headmaster, James Murphy, 'would die in a massacre' and posted derogatory racial remarks about the pastoral head of the school, Ann-Marie Jess, adding that he wanted to assault her. The town's sheriff court was told that the 17-year-old, who has since left the Roman Catholic school, tweeted the alarming comments on June 5 this year. Ferguson, of Falkirk, who appeared in court in a grey suit, white shirt and black tie, pleaded guilty to using threatening and abusive behaviour. He had been due to face trial today. The court heard he had no previous convictions. Solicitor-advocate Martin Morrow, defending, told the court that his client had now left the 1,350-pupil school. Sheriff William Gallacher deferred sentence for a social worker's report until October, when the court will also hear the full details of the case. The sheriff continued Ferguson's bail on condition that he does not enter the school 'unless invited' and makes no attempt to contact Mr Murphy or Ms Jess. The sheriff said the case caused him 'some concern'. He said: 'I haven't heard any background yet, but it is obviously a very unpleasant and very serious matter. 'I want to know how someone with no past convictions could behave in this way.' St Mungo's High School, the only Roman Catholic high school in the Falkirk Council area, moved to a new building on the site of the old school's sports fields five years ago.

"Remember learning to suck milkshake through a straw for the first time? Or when you first got the hang of blowing bubbles in the bath? The sensation is no different for a baby elephant. An adorable two-week old elephant calf at Reid Park Zoo in Tucson, Arizona, is at that very stage now as she learns to use her trunk, with her latest trick being to playfully blow bubbles in the water. Reid Park Zoo can be found on Facebook and at their website. 'Like this, mummy?' The two-week-old elephant calf experiments by plunging her trunk into the water . When they are first born baby elephants don't really know what to do with their trunks - apart from swing them to and fro a bit and sometimes step on them. Many elephant babies suck their trunk just like human babies suck their thumb, and usually it takes until six to eight months they can use their trunks to eat and drink. So this baby girl elephant must be quite precocious. The video from the zoo, which is documenting every stage of the as-yet-unnamed girl's development on its website, shows her with Semba and a tub of water as she makes short work of using her trunk to suck up water and blow bubbles, her ears flapping madly as she plays. Swirling the water and sucking it up then blowing produces some interesting results... Proud mother Semba leaves her little darling to it as she  flaps her cute little ears with excitement .","Two-week-old elephant calf was born Reid Park Zoo in Tucson, Arizona .

"A 9-year-old Texas boy was struck by what some call a freak lightning bolt during a soccer game on August 26, leaving him in a 'semi-vegetative state.' Alex Hermann of Austin was on the field when he and two others were injured by the bolt before 5pm. But only Alex has been left severely injured--unable to speak, move, talk or hear. While bystanders claim the strike came out of the blue, Hermann's parents are suing the Lake Travis Youth Association for $10 million on claims they were negligent in getting the vulnerable kids off the field amid the approaching storm. Terrible: 9-year-old Alex Hermann was struck by lightning on August 26 on a soccer field in Texas and remains in a semi-vegetative state . Outpouring of support: Alex was hit the worst of the three children affected by the lightning strike. He cannot move, speak, or hear . 'One practice was ending and another was about to start, and some kids were in the middle of the field, and it came totally out of the blue,' coach Glenn Smith told the Statesman in a statement. 'It was six miles out from the storm is what the weather guys were telling us … we’re having meetings to see if anything else could have been done.' The elementary school boy was not as lucky as the other two children, who've since been released from medical care. According to Hermann's attorneys, his and the suffering of his teammates could and should have been prevented. 'Alex Hermann, sustained severe and permanent damages when all of the Defendants failed to comply with the basic safety principles on weather safety when lightning is in the area,' reads the court petition obtained by the Houston Chronicle. Heartbreaking: Often seen in photos with his beloved dog, it's now unclear when the boy and his pooch will be reunited as Alex remains in serious conditions and under constant care . 'As a result, Minor Plaintiff, Alex Hermann, was hit by lightning and is now unable to speak, hear, talk or move.' But one safety tool the plaintiffs contend officials at the recreation area should have had, lightning detectors, are prohibitively costly.'Hardly anybody has lightning detectors, and nobody knows the accuracy of them at this point,' Smith told the Lake Travis View. 'I called a bunch of youth league offices and they don’t have them. It’s a $60,000 investment and we don’t even know much about them.' Levin and the Hermanns want the $10million for current and future medical care for Alex, whose care Levin says has already reached half a million dollars. A GoFundMe page called Pray for Alex has as of Wednesday night received nearly $18,000 in donations. Suing for $10million: Horror struck at this soccer field just before 5pm on August 26. Some say the lighting bolt came from 'out of the blue' but the Hermanns are blaming the soccer officials they say should have taken the children to safety before tragedy struck .","Alex Hermann of Austin, Texas was struck by a bolt of lightning on August 26 as he played soccer .

"A historic chalet has been saved from destruction  after decades of erosion to the Quinault River's banks left the building teetering on the edge of collapse. The Enchanted Valley chalet was built in the 1930s  in the Olympic National Park, Washington, a safe distance from the water. But over time, as the harsh weather took its toll, it became obvious the chalet had to be relocated. Plans for a move were ramped up when last winter's dramatic storms wore away the banks to such an extent that it pushed them  under part of the chalet, leaving it dangling over the water below. Precarious: The Enchanted Valley chalet in Washington State was left dangling over the river by a storm . Rescue: Workers were able to drag the 1930s building back from the brink after flying in gear . It had today been dragged 68ft from the river bank, buying it years of extra time. The remote location, 13 miles from the nearest road, could only be reached with a combination of mules, who carried tools to the site, and helicopters for bigger items. Contractors were expected to complete the relocation of the Enchanted Valley chalet over the next few days, and the lodge will be moved a total of 90ft from the Quinault River. The 42-by-28-foot structure was built as a wilderness lodge in the 1930s. It has been used as a ranger station and emergency shelter. Danger: The Quinault river was whipped up by a violent storm this year and cut out the ground from underneath . View from below: The historic shack, used by wilderness rangers, was saved by workmen . Park officials said storms last winter and high flows led to the river's main channel shifting by at least 15 feet, and recent photographs showed that the chalet was undercut by the river by around 8 feet. Building contractors moved the chalet by lifting it from its foundations and slid it along steel beams to its current location. The building will be lowered onto cribbing towers at its final home. Earlier: This picture from March this year shows the chalet on a less eroded bank . Remote: The chalet is around 13 miles from the nearest road, and had to be accessed by mule .","Wooden chalet was built next to Quinault River, Washington, in the 1930s .

"Regal and fierce, cats are the queens of the animal kingdom. But few get to live in a palace like the one Greg Krueger has made for his four felines. For 15 years, he has worked day and night building secret passageways, wall-mounted paths, slides and staircases that scale his home in Minnesota. Wonderland: Greg Krueger's four cats spend their days scurrying around a 300ft playground in the house . The sprawling wonderland spans more than 300 feet, with a garden of plants growing catnip. And he is still going. Finally diagnosed with Asperger's Syndrome last year, Krueger says his illness is a blessing for giving him the dedication to turn his imagination into reality.

"Cesc Fabregas will face Arsenal for the first time this weekend since leaving the club in 2011. But how have previous Arsenal old boys fared in their first match against the club? Thierry Henry . Arsenal 2-2 Barcelona, March 2010 . Arsenal’s greatest ever goalscorer returned to the Emirates with Barcelona in the 2010 Champions League quarter-final but started on the bench. He replaced Zlatan Ibrahimovic — who scored both goals in the 2-2 draw — late on and was unsurprisingly given a hero’s welcome. Thierry Henry was given a hero's welcome by the Arsenal supporters when he returned with Barcelona . Patrick Vieira . Arsenal 2-0 Juventus, March 2006 . After leaving for Juventus in the summer of 2005, the midfield general returned the very next season in the Champions League quarter-final. Despite a warm reception, Vieira was on the wrong end of a 2-0 scoreline and picked up a booking, which ruled him out of the second leg. Patrick Vieira received a warm reception from the Arsenal fans but ended up losing with Juventus . Robin van Persie . Man Utd 2-1 Arsenal, November 2012 . After the Dutchman left for Man United in 2012, he was jeered by his old fans when Arsenal travelled to Old Trafford. It did not take long for him to remind them of what they were missing - he scored after just three minutes in a 2-1 United win. Robin van Persie took just three minutes to score against his former club as he went on to win with Man United . Gael Clichy . Arsenal 1-0 Man City, April 2012 . It was a lukewarm reception for Clichy when he made his first return to the Emirates in 2012. There were some early boos but the home crowd needn’t have worried as Clichy’s City side were undone by a late Mikel Arteta winner. Gael Clichy received a few boos on his return to the Emirates and was unable to stop the home side winning . Samir Nasri . Arsenal 0-1 Man City, November 2011 .

"Following the death of Hollywood legend Robin Williams, the number of Australians seeking help from the Beyondblue Support Service nearly doubled. The 63-year-old U.S.acting legend was in the early stages of Parkinson's disease and was struggling with depression and anxiety before he died in his northern California home on August 11. Beyondblue CEO Georgie Harman said the sheer numbers of Australians who contacted their service following his death showed that many Australians were in need of urgent support. The Hollywood legend Robin Williams was in the early stages of Parkinson's disease and was struggling with depression and anxiety before he died in his Northern California home on August 11 . Ms Harman said there were about 2,200 phone conversations, web chats and email conversations with the Support Service in the 72 hours after his death was announce, up from 1,300 over the same period the week before. These numbers were significantly higher than the long-term average. 'This means someone contacted beyondblue’s Support Service every two minutes for three straight days requesting support or information,' she said. 'During this time, the information the community was looking for was the signs and symptoms of depression, anxiety and suicide risk, and what to do if you’re worried about someone. 'This extraordinary demand highlights the need to continue educating people about illnesses such as depression and anxiety, which can lead to suicide, and shows that the community wants support people who may be going through a tough time.

"Women's colleges across the U.S. are revisiting policies around enrolling transgender students as institutions of higher learning — single-sex, coed and those with religious affiliations — demonstrate varying degrees of acceptance for changing norms. Mills College in Oakland, California, recently became the first women's college in the U.S. to declare it would accept undergraduate applications from 'self-identified women' and people 'assigned female at birth who do not fit into the gender binary,' effective the semester that starts January 2015. Mount Holyoke College in South Hadley, Massachusetts, followed with a similar announcement last week. Administrators at other prominent women's colleges also are weighing changes. As thoughts of gender are evolving, U.S. colleges are revisiting their enrollment policies (stock image) The discussions are, in part, an acknowledgment that thoughts on gender are evolving. Student activists have been steadily pushing for colleges to make changes, and some schools have altered applications to allow applicants to select 'transgender' as a third option for gender or given them the option to discuss their gender identity in a short essay. 'What it means to be a woman isn't static,' says Mount Holyoke President Lynn Pasquerella, who announced the admissions policy change at the college's convocation ceremony. 'Early feminists argued that reducing women to their biological functions was a foundation of women's oppression. We don't want to fall back on that.' Other institutions, however, want to place limits on those students once they arrive on campus, including what sports they can play, which bathrooms they can use and where they can live. Simpson University, Spring Arbor University and George Fox University are among the Christian colleges that have recently sought and received a religious exemption from Title IX, the federal law banning gender-based discrimination in education. Pasquerella says her college's decision represents a counterpoint of sorts to those actions. 'It's part of a national conversation,' she said. 'When you have Time magazine with (transgender actress) Laverne Cox on the cover and The New York Times running articles on transgender issues almost every week, it's part of mainstream discourse.' But even within Mount Holyoke's extended community, the policy shifts have not been fully embraced. Some alumnae voiced their displeasure on the college's Facebook page following the announcement. 'Mount Holyoke is a women's college, and it should admit women. Period. Full stop,' wrote Pamela Adkins, a Tampa, Florida, resident who graduated from Mount Holyoke in 1979. SMITH COLLEGE . A women's college in western Massachusetts, Smith recently said it is excluding financial aid documents from the list of materials it uses to affirm an applicant's gender identity. Now, only the application and official supporting documents are part of that review.  Officials say they are weighing further changes. Smith alumni include Julia Child and two recent first ladies. WELLESLEY COLLEGE . Wellesley, a women's college outside Boston whose alumni include Hillary Rodham Clinton, says it will hold lectures, discussions and presentations this academic year on 'what it means to be a women's college at a time when definitions of gender are expanding.' BARNARD COLLEGE . Barnard, in New York, says it will hold similar campus conversations about transgender students at women's colleges. Officials say that in the meantime it, like some other women's colleges, will be reviewing transgender applications on a case-by-case basis. DUKE UNIVERSITY . North Carolina's Duke has added an options question to its application meant to encourage applicants — in up to 250 words — to discuss their sexual orientation or gender identity. UNIVERSITY OF IOWA . Iowa allows applicants to select 'transgender' as a third option in its gender question. It also asks an optional question about sexual orientation. In a follow up email, she said: 'There are plenty of other places for people who are not women to go, and they should go there. Don't negate the reasons Mount Holyoke was founded and for what it has been known since 1837: providing a superlative college education — for women.' Pasquerella acknowledged the detractors, but she said current students have been overwhelmingly supportive. Jennie Ochterski, a female senior and an organizer for Open Gates, a student group that had helped push for the admissions policy change, says she doesn't believe excluding trans women from admission fits with Mount Holyoke's mission. Marilyn Hammond, president of the Women's College Coalition, said she expects many of the 47 women's colleges in the U.S. and Canada will eventually develop formal admission policies on transgender students. She dismissed the notion that such policies dilute the mission of women's colleges, many of which were founded at a time when higher learning institutions were largely closed to women. 'This is consistent with women's colleges' missions and historic willingness to address issues of diversity, inclusion and social justice,' Hammond said. Transgender student activists are elated by the developments, which they say are long overdue. At the same time, they acknowledge there are bigger hurdles for their community overcome. 'We must be wary of policies being thought of as actual change,' says Eli Erlick, a transgender female at Pitzer College in Claremont, Calif., who says she might have considered applying to a women's college had the admissions changes happened earlier. 'No policy will change transphobic attitudes.' Calliope Wong, a transgender female who garnered national headlines last year when she disclosed that Smith College had refused to review her application, says the debate over women's college admissions, if nothing else, can help highlight the myriad challenges transgender people face. 'Hopefully this leads to changes in attitudes in general,' said the University of Connecticut sophomore. 'So that more people realize we do face employment discrimination and that we do have issues with legal representation and health care coverage.'","Mills College in Oakland, Ca, became the first women's college in the U.S. to accept undergrad applications from 'self-identified women'

"Mugshot: Martin Bass was arrested on Tuesday  after officers found his child in a car outside a casino . A father has been arrested after he allegedly left his one-year-old child behind the wheel of a running car so that he could go into a casino and gamble. Martin Bass was arrested  on Tuesday in Tunica, Mississippi and taken to the Tunica County jail after officers found his child in a car outside Bally's casino. A sign in the casino's car park warns gamblers not to leave a child in the car or deputies will be called. It says: 'Children or vulnerable adults must not be left unattended in vehicles. Violations may result in notification to the Department of Human Services and or law enforcement authorities.' But Tunica County Sheriff's Department  said that officers responded to the casino after the baby had been left in the car alone for almost an hour. Police found the baby in the driver's seat playing with the steering wheel while the car was running. Bass now faces child neglect charges. It was also not immediately clear whether he has an attorney. The Department of Human Services was also notified after Bass's arrest. It's unclear if the child is in protective custody or staying with family.

"A woman who beat her musician boyfriend to death with a guitar stand and smoked cannabis before eventually calling 999 has been jailed for life. Samantha Adeokun, 41, killed Peter Davegun, 42, in a brutal attack on December 23 last year, kicking and punching him as he curled up in a ball to protect himself before she hit him with the metal stand. Adeokun then smoked the drug and chatted to her daughter on the phone as Mr Davegun lay dead on his bedroom floor in Hartshill, Stoke-on-Trent. Jailed: Samantha Adeokun, 41, (left)  has been jailed for life after she beat her boyfriend Peter Davegun, 42, (right) to death with a metal guitar stand . When she called an ambulance 40 minutes later she told the operator Mr Davegun had accidentally struck his head. She had denied murder, maintaining she was the victim of domestic violence and had been trying to defend herself against Mr Davegun, but was convicted following a trial at Stafford Crown Court. Yesterday was given a life sentence and ordered to serve a minimum of 18 years behind bars. 'I am satisfied that you, and you alone, were the aggressor, and you beat him mercilessly and brutally so he was dead or close to death,' Judge Simon Tonking said. 'As a result of what you did that man was deprived of his life. 'His family and friends have had their lives devastated by what you did. Every Christmas will be sullied by the memory of his needless death at this time.' Musician: Mr Davegun had suffered multiple injuries to his head and body after being bludgeoned with a metal guitar stand which left the room resembling 'a bloodbath' The court heard Mr Davegun had suffered multiple injuries to his head and body after being bludgeoned with a metal guitar stand which left the room resembling 'a bloodbath'. Emergency services rushed to his home, after Adeokun told the operator her boyfriend had smashed his head after tripping over a mat. Paramedics arrived just before 2.45pm and found Mr Davegun’s body lying in the foetal position on his bedroom floor. The court heard he had extensive bruising and bite marks on his body, and had suffered severe internal injuries as well as seven fractured ribs. Rigor mortis had already started to set in before he was pronounced dead at the property at around 3.20pm. During the trial Deborah Gould, prosecuting, said: 'The defendant literally beat him to death using her fists, feet and part of a guitar stand. Weapon: The section of guitar stand used by Adeokun to attack her boyfriend, as he lay curled up in a ball . 'At least part of the time she was doing this, she was bleeding and standing above him. 'She struck him repeatedly, causing significant internal bruising and bleeding. She struck him from behind and from the front. 'You will hear from the pathologist that there’s evidence he was struck while on the ground in the foetal position. 'After the attack, the defendant telephoned her daughter and said she was sorry. 'She said she and the deceased had a fight. 'She said she had been defending herself and Mr Davegun was, at that stage, unconscious. 'When her daughter asked if she had called 999, the defendant said she hadn’t because she needed to get dressed because she had blood on her. Emergency: Emergency services rushed to Mr Davegun's home, after Adeokun told the operator her boyfriend had smashed his head after tripping over a mat . Delay: The court heard Adeokun waited 40 minutes before she called emergency services to the flat . 'She changed out of her clothing. 'Then, nearly an hour afterwards, she called paramedics, claiming Mr Davegun had fallen, hit his head and been unconscious for 40 minutes.' The jury also heard a recording of the 999 call Adeokun made during which she described the scene as a 'bloodbath'. She told the operator: 'We had a big argument earlier on and he’s just fell. 'I cut my finger and it looks bad. I cut my finger and it looks like I’ve killed him.' Speaking after the case, Detective Inspector Glyn Pattinson, Senior Investigating Officer for Staffordshire Police, said: 'Samantha Adeokun had tried to portray herself as a victim of domestic abuse in this case. 'She claimed that Peter Davegun’s death had been as a result of him accidentally hitting his head on a metal TV stand during an argument as she had pushed him away while trying to defend herself. 'However, the post-mortem showed that his injuries were not consistent with an accident and that his injuries to his back, upper limbs and head indicated that he had been subjected to a severe beating. 'Adeokun tried to convince the court that she was in fear of Mr Davegun, initially stating that he had come by his injuries accidentally before finally accepting in court that she must have been responsible for his death. 'However, her story unravelled as she tried to lie her way out of things and she has been caught out and shown for the violent person she really is.' A family statement released by Staffordshire Police said: 'Pete was a close friend to many and they are proud to refer to him as ""Brother"". 'He was a kind gentle man, who cared deeply about his family and his music. He is a great loss to us all.'","Samantha Adeokun, 41, killed Peter Davegun, 42, on December 23 last year .

"She spends her days sewing bat wings onto bearded dragons and transforming sheep into unicorns but taxidermist Jayne Brown, 45, from Southend-on-Sea says none of this is particularly unusual. A self-described 'rogue taxidermist', Ms Brown describes her profession as a form of upcycling and says she insists on sourcing the animals used in an ethical way. Now the glamorous forty-something is to appear on new Channel 4 documentary, All Creatures Great and Stuffed and says she hopes it will change peoples' preconceptions of the art. Scroll down for video . Glamorous: Jayne Brown, 45, poses with some of her restored pieces, including an antique tiger skin rug . 'I hope it makes people see taxidermy in a different light, she explains, 'because most people think of Norman Bates [the taxidermy-obsessed serial killer in Psycho] or old men in a . shed skinning squirrels. I'm hoping to dispel those preconceptions.' Ms Brown, who also works as an interior designer, first became interested in taxidermy while redecorating her attic in colonial style and happened upon a stuffed lion while browsing for furniture on eBay. 'I stumbled across this full mount lion,' she explains. 'It was faded due to being left in someone's porch and I had to restore him. 'I had to re-dye him so I ended up going to Boots and buying up all the Nearly Blonde touch-up hair dye which, oddly enough, turned out to be the right colour.' Pro: Jayne's passion for taxidermy began after she restored a moth-eaten stuffed lion named Aslan . Curios: Jayne specialises in rogue taxidermy and creates lots of weird and wonderful creatures . Not that she uses it anymore. Now a fully fledged taxidermist, Ms Brown prefers using acid dyes designed for professionals and specialises in what she describes as 'rogue taxidermy'. This, she explains, means creating weird and wonderful beast galore, including, most recently, a replica of the Vacanti Mouse - the so-called 'earmouse' created by scientist Charles Vacanti in 1997. Although the human ear was crafted from latex, the mouse itself was real. Not that Ms Brown, a self-confessed animal lover, had one killed to order. 'I'm extremely concerned with being . ethical,' she insists. 'The animals I use are natural deaths,  roadkill or mice and chicks that would otherwise be food for snakes. I certainly do not want anything . killed for taxidermy.' Her clients come from all over the world, with many declaring a passion for all things Gothic, while others want their dead pets preserved. More still want fantastical creations such as mythical creatures created by cobbling together bits of different animals. 'I recently did a dragon,' she reveals. 'It was made from a bearded . dragon [a large lizard] that had passed away and the wings came from a bat.' Other specialities include pendants that include real rat or mouse tails, smaller mammals such as foxes and occasionally, a pet. 'The most odd thing I've been . asked is when a man came to me with a living cat and asked me to turn it . into a pair of gloves,' she chuckles. 'Obviously the cat was still alive, and he had a second - the plan was to have one for one glove and the other for the other.' Unusual: In life, this unicorn was a white lamb but was transformed into a mythical beast after death by Jayne . Starting point: Jayne's colonial themed attic (pictured) kickstarted her enduring love affair with taxidermy . Gloves, however, are not where she sees the project going. 'I hope he . changes his mind about it,' she adds. 'In the end, we came to the conclusion that a hat might be . better because gloves get worn out.' Laughing, she adds: 'People think I'm strange but there . are people in the world who want their cats turned into gloves!' - All Creatures Great and Stuffed, tonight at 10pm on Channel 4 .","Jayne Brown, 45, is one of the UK's new wave of professional taxidermists .

"Conrad Hilton was driving at 200mph when he hit two cars and crashed on a highway near Palm Springs last month, witnesses claim. Paris Hilton's 19-year-old brother had to be pulled from his wrecked BMW by the jaws of life after changing lanes, hitting a Volkswagen, and colliding with a tractor trailer on Saturday August 23. Incredibly, the teenager escaped without a major injury. 'Speeding': Police are investigating claims that Paris Hilton's 18-year-old brother Conrad, pictured in May at LAX, was driving at 200mph when he was involved in a major car crash in Palm Springs last month . Today, it has emerged numerous motorists pulled over to call 911 with reports that Hilton was driving at 200mph, according to TMZ. Police confirmed they received multiple reports of a reckless driver at the time of the incident, which was also witnessed by a California Highway Patrol helicopter. Firefighters then used the jaws of life to pull Hilton from his vehicle before he was taken  to Desert Regional Medical Center. According to TMZ, Hilton reportedly skimmed the back of another car when he tried to change lanes, which caused him to hit the back of a tractor trailer before he came to a stop at the side of the road. Police determined that alcohol or drugs were not factors in the collision. Conrad and socialite Paris, pictured in LA in 2009, and the great-grandchildren of hotel baron Conrad Hilton . MailOnline has contacted Hilton's representative for comment. This isn't Hilton's first brush with the law. In 2011, he crashed into two parked cars in Los Angeles after a night out in West Hollywood.

"Sir John Major said 'no one should weep' for Labour if the party loses 40 MPs in the next election . Former Prime Minister John Major today blamed Labour for the growing threat of Scottish independence – claiming the party had spent years attacking the Conservatives and Westminster. Sir John said Labour and the SNP ‘have fed a divisive narrative that has bitten deep, ignoring the revolution in Scottish living standards brought about, in large part, by Conservative policies’. He added: ‘It would be ironic indeed if Scotland voted for separation, and Labour lost all its significant representation in the House of Commons. If this comes to pass, no one should weep for them.’ Sir John's remarks, in an article in the Times newspaper today, come amid growing panic among senior Labour figures over the prospect of independence. The party would lose more than 40 MPs, potentially depriving it of the chance of a Commons majority after the next election. But a vote for Scottish independence would be ‘disastrous’ for the whole of the United Kingdom and not just Labour, Sir John said. In a second impassioned plea to Scots, in an interview on the BBC this morning, he said Britain would be 'diminished' on the world stage. He told Radio 4's Today programme that the United Kingdom was ‘the most successful union’ in history but would be badly damaged without Scotland. He said: ‘I am desperately concerned at what is happening. We would be immensely weaker as a nation in every respect - morally, politically, in every material aspect - if Scotland and the rest of the United Kingdom were to part company. ‘This year is the 100th anniversary of the First World War. As we honour the people who fought together then, would it not be extraordinary if the SNP broke up the most successful union and partnership in all history in any part of the world?’ Sir John said that young Scots considering casting a vote for independence in next week's referendum would find themselves living in ‘a very different country’ over the coming decades if there was a Yes vote. ‘There is easy assumption that Scotland will be waved into the European Union. Well, maybe after a period of years that's possible but it's not certain. Spain for example wouldn't welcome a separatist nation,’ he said. ‘There is the belief they are going to be able to get into Nato. Why would Nato let them in when the SNP propose to wreck the Trident independent nuclear weapon? ‘If Britain lost Trident it would have lost what has shielded it and protected it for a long time - including Scotland. 'For that to be done by the enemy would be a disaster, to have it done by friends is almost unbelievable.’ Former prime minister Gordon Brown has become the de-facto leader of the Better Together campaign amid a surge in support for independence . Sir John said that the lose of the Trident nuclear deterrent - which is currently based in Scotland - would have consequences for the whole of the UK. ‘Our role in Nato would be reduced, our relations consequently with the United States would be damaged,’ he said . ‘The United Kingdom would be weaker in every international body it attends. We would lose our seat at the top table in the United Nations.’ The former premier - who warned 20 years ago that Scottish devolution would be ‘the high road to separation’ - was scathing about the SNP's inability to say what currency they would use if they did achieve independence. ‘It is one week away from the vote and people of Scotland do not know what currency they will have - I've never known such incompetence,’ he said. Mr Cameron made an impassioned plea for the union during his visit to the Scottish Widows offices in Edinburgh today .","Labour and the SNP 'have fed a divisive narrative that has bitten deep'

"A mother and daughter died in a blaze started by a banned black market cigarette, an inquest heard. Firefighters issued a warning after the death of Caroline Kaur and daughter Hayleigh at their home in Plumstead, south-east London. An Indian-made packet of cigarettes was found at the scene and is believed to have been the cause of the fire. Wrestling fan Hayleigh Kaur, 23, was found dead at her home with her mother Caroline after a blaze started by a black market cigarette . The cigarettes did not have a UK-standard safety feature to stop it burning for long periods. Caroline Kaur, believed to be in her 50s, and her 23-year-old daughter Hayleigh were the victims of a blaze which destroyed their family home in the early hours of June 18. Residents described hearing shouts and 'blasts like fireworks' at 1am from the fire which left the house gutted and half the roof destroyed. The inquest also found a smoke alarm probably saved the lives of other people living in the property. Three more women, two men and a dog managed to escape the blaze which saw 35 firefighters tackle the inferno for more than two hours. Rajinder Singh who lost a wife and daughter in the house fire was keen to promote the importance of a working smoke alarm in every home. Caroline Kaur and daughter Hayleigh died at their home in Plumstead, south east London, after a blaze started by a banned cigarette . He said: 'It is essential everyone tests their smoke alarms and makes sure you replace the batteries immediately if they don't work. 'My wife had replaced the batteries in our smoke alarms just days before the fire and if we hadn't done that it is likely the whole family would have died.' 'It's vital that you know what to do if there is a fire in your home, have a clear escape plan and keep door and window keys where everyone you live with can find them.' Meanwhile, neighbour Dorothy McCole, who lives opposite, paid tribute to the mother-of-five. Mrs McCole who worked with the victim at nearby Gallions Mount Primary School, said: 'Caroline was the matriarch in that family - she led the family. 'She was a lovely, lovely person and a leader. All I could see was this house in flames, absolutely massive flames. 'If you can imagine an open fire in a grate - that is what it was like. It was so fierce.' The brigade has urged all smokers to buy cigarettes that meet European Union safety standards and never to throw cigarettes or hot ash into rubbish bins. The coroner concluded that both deaths were accidental.","Caroline  and Hayleigh Kaur died at their home in south-east London .

"Michaela McAreavey (right) was murdered in her honeymoon suite at the luxury Legends hotel in 2011. The newlywed’s body was found in the bathtub by her husband John (left) Police investigating the murder of honeymoon bride Michaela McAreavey in Mauritius more than three years ago are understood to be focusing on four new potential suspects. The 27-year-old daughter of Tyrone manager Mickey Harte was murdered in her honeymoon suite at the luxury Legends hotel on January 10, 2011. The newlywed’s body was found in the bathtub by her husband John. A new probe was launched by Mauritian police after two former hotel workers were acquitted of the crime following a high-profile trial on the holiday island in the summer of 2012. A new trial into the Co. Tyrone teacher’s murder is now expected following the Mauritian DPP’s revelation yesterday that police were working hard to bring ‘fresh and compelling evidence’ to trial. In July 2012, hotel staff Sandip Moneea and Avinash Treebhoowoon, were acquitted of the bride’s murder and the case seemed to come to a standstill. Last night Ms McAreavey’s family issued a statement as the Mauritian Director of Public Prosecutions, Mr Satyajit Boolell, said Mauritius’s Central Criminal Investigation Department was working to bring ‘fresh’ evidence to ‘educate’ a new trial. The Mauritian newspaper L’Express reported that four potential suspects – all employees of the former Legends hotel – were being investigated by the CCID. The newspaper also claimed it would be a ‘matter of days’ before the investigation was ‘re-opened’ at the Assizes Court of Mauritius. The Harte and McAreavey families, who have previously been critical about what they claimed was a lack of progress in finding the killers, said they had now been told of developments in the investigation. The newlywed was killed while on honeymoon with her husband John at the Legends Hotel, pictured, in Mauritius in January 2011 . A statement issued by the families read: ‘The McAreavey and Harte families have been recently informed about new developments in the investigation into Michaela’s murder. 'They will await further information on those developments before making any additional comment.’ A security source told the Irish Daily Mirror police had reviewed the evidence in the case. The source said: 'Their investigation has focused on a dummy electronic card found in Michaela and John’s room. 'This is the card used to secretly swipe the actual key to the suite, and detectives believe it is a crucial piece of evidence that will lead them to the killer.' Although a new trial is expected to be announced, the date for such a process was not known last night. In July 2012, hotel staff Sandip Moneea (left) and Avinash Treebhoowoon (right), were acquitted of the bride’s murder and the case seemed to come to a standstill . Mr McAreavey, a 28-year-old accountant, spoke of the couple's love for each other while giving evidence as a prosecution witness at the initial trial at the Supreme Court in the island’s capital, Port Louis. He said his own life had effectively ended when his ‘wonderful, wonderful’ wife was killed. He also took photographs of Mrs McAreavey to show the jury as he described how he missed her. 'Michaela was a wonderful, wonderful person, a really special human,’ he said during his evidence.

"British plans to set up new military bases in the Middle East as part of a strategy to tackle the threat posed by Islamic State extremists are currently being considered, it has been reported. The United Arab Emirates (UAE), Oman and Bahrain are all being looked at as part of the Government's attempts to contain the terror threat from the wider region, according to The Times. Officials have said the Ministry of Defence (MoD) is 'currently looking at its future engagement in the region', but no decisions have been made. Plans to set up new military bases in the Middle East are being considered as part of a strategy to tackle extremism, it has been reported. Pictured is a British soldier with the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan in 2007 . According to The Times report, Downing Street has been expected to make an announcement for some months. The al-Minhad airbase near Dubai is already used by troops flying in and out of Afghanistan. A defence source told the newspaper: 'You could see an infantry battalion based in al-Minhad, being able to train alongside the Emirates.' It is understood that work began before the rise of Islamic State and is part of a review of the UK's presence in the Gulf following the withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan. Michael Clarke, director of the Royal United Services Institute think-tank, said there had been a shift toward such a move over the last two years. He told The Times: 'The effect is that we are making a strategic adjustment, which is in my view quite sensible. Officials said the Ministry of Defence (MoD) is 'currently looking at its future engagement in the region', but no decisions have been made. Pictured is an ISIS fighter in Raqqa . 'But it is not something that I think has come from Downing Street. This has come through the armed forces working it out.'

'The MoD is currently looking at its future engagement in the region including options for our military presence in the Gulf; this work is still in development and no final decisions have yet been made.'","UAE, Oman and Bahrain all being considered for bases by the Government .

"John Terry has praised Chelsea team-mate Gary Cahill for his 'immense' match-defining block to deny Josip Drmic in England 2-0 win over Switzerland.

He said: 'They've done very well. The manager and the team will be delighted with this performance. 'The pace up front from Sterling, Welbeck and Wazza [Rooney] stretched the opponents and that definitely benefited us.' On Sterling's contribution, Welbeck added: 'He's been brilliant all night, he's been the difference. Every time he got the ball, he wanted to do something.

"There's nothing sweet about this intercontinental pastry feud. A battle has erupted between Bergen and New York over which city has constructed the world's largest gingerbread village. Guinness World Records last month named South Bronx chef Jon Lovitch's 1.5 ton cookie construction in New York City the globe's largest edible village - a decision that's miffed some proud Norwegians. New York's 'Gingerbread Lane' 'The world's largest gingerbread village': Chef Jon Lovitch baked and constructed the Guinness World Record-winning 'Gingerbread Lane' in his South Bronx, New York apartment . Bergen's  'Pepperkakebyen' 'Pepperkakebyen': Officials in Bergen, Norway claim the city's gingerbread village is the largest 'in the universe' even though New York claimed the official title this year . Bergen unveiled Gingerbread Town, or Pepperkakebyen, on Tuesday, which is spread across 380 square meters. A major tourist attraction, the cookie village is constructed every year with slices of gingerbread baked by Bergen's schools and citizens . 'Once again we have the record. It's . just totally amazing, we simply have the largest, most beautiful and . best gingerbread city in the universe,' Steinar Kristoffersen, who led the project, boasted at the opening, according to The Local. While Bergen claims its gingerbread town is the world's biggest, this . year's official title was claimed by a New York chef on November 17. According to the Guinness World Records website, Lovitch's village meets all the record guidelines - the 135 residential and 22 commercial buildings were at least 5.9 inches tall. But some Norwegians are challenging the decision. Ørjan Jacobsen Fjeldstad wrote on the Guinness webpage: 'The yearly gingerbread city in Bergen, Norway is bigger than the official world record.' Meryl Pearlstein, a New York PR professional, fired back: 'The Norwegian village does not meet the guidelines as it is spread out over a large space.' Turf war: Citizens of Bergen and New York are feuding on the Guinness World Record website over which city's gingerbread village is the largest . Bergen's  'Pepperkakebyen' Epic: Bergen's village includes 1,990 trains and buildings spread out over 380 square meters . Team effort: The buildings in Bergen's gingerbread village were baked by schools and individuals across the city . Thomas Ottosson, who worked on Bergen's village, told The Local the city may not be able to approach Guinness this year as it did not have recipes for each of the 1,990 buildings which were baked by schools and individuals. 'The difference is that the one in New York is all made from the same recipe, and when it's the same recipe he can make sure that all of it is edible,' he said. 'Guinness have some rules that everything should be edible, and they need the recipes.' New York's creation, which is as heavy as a large hippopotamus and the size of a two-car garage, ticks all the Guinness boxes. Lovitch, 37, began building the 'Gingerbread Lane' houses, ice rink, firehouse, and railroad stations at his apartment in February. The Marriott Hotel executive chef said he spent a 'few grand' on the project, buying 400 pounds of candy, ingredients for 500 pounds of gingerbread dough and 2,240 pounds of icing. The exhibit, on display at the New York Hall of Science in Queens, encompasses 157 structures glued together with thick icing. 'Being a chef, people may remember my meals for a day or two, but with the gingerbread, I can get thousands of people at a time checking out my work,' Lovitch told New York Times. 'I’ve gotten emails a year later, thanking me for it.' New York's 'Gingerbread Lane' Finishing touches: Chef Jon Lovitch's 1.5 ton creation is on display at the New York Hall of Science .

"When a man wants to spend the rest of his life with a woman, he often extends an offer to her to become part of his family. But International Polo Club Palm Beach founder John Goodman, 48, did so in a very unorthodox way. The multimillionaire trust-fund heir adopted his 42-year-old girlfriend Heather Laruso Hutchins last fall, after being accused of drunk driving in a 2010 accident that left 23-year-old Scott Wilson dead. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Newest family member: John Goodman, right, adopted his 42-year-old girlfriend Heather Hutchins last fall . Goodman is being sued by Wilson’s parents for wrongful death. According to police reports, Goodman ran a stop sign on February 10, 2010 in Wellington, Florida and smashed into Wilson, sending his car into a canal. Scott Wilson, a 23-year-old graduate of the University of Central Florida, was killed in 2010 . Circuit Judge Glenn Kelly had previously ruled that the trust funds set up for his two biological children were off-limits in the lawsuit, according to the Palm Beach Post. Court papers show that Goodman adopted Ms Hutchins in October of last year, CBS12.com reported. ‘My reaction was that it was both awful and brilliant,’ Belray Beach adoption attorney Charlotte Danciu told CBS12.com. The adoption papers state that Hutchins, now a legal child of Goodman, is immediately entitled to at least a third of his trust. Goodman and Ms Hutchins began dating in 2009, according to her testimony. The Wilsons’ attorney, Scott Smith, told the Palm Beach Post that Goodman is attempting to use the adoption to shield his assets. ‘It cannot go unrecognised that (Goodman) chose to adopt his 42-year-old adult girlfriend as opposed to a needy child,' he told the paper. Judge Kelley wrote that the events are taking the court ‘into a legal twilight zone.’ The trial: John Goodman's lawyer said in court that the adoption has nothing to do with his pending criminal trial . Wreckage: Goodman is charged with driving while intoxicated and vehicular manslaughter after police reports show he ran a stop sign and slammed into Scott Wilson's Hyundai, right . Ms Danciu agreed. ‘Unless you intend to create the parent-child relationship, you are violating the letter of the law,’ she told CBS12.com. Arrested: John Goodman is currently on trial for the DUI death of Wilson . Scott Wilson was a University of Central Florida graduate and was working as a civil engineer. He had been driving his Hyundai home . to Wellington to visit his family, according to the Palm Beach New Times . when he was struck by Goodman's Bentley convertible after he ran a stop sign. Wilson's car was knocked into a nearby canal, where he drowned. Goodman was found to have a blood alcohol level twice the legal limit after the fatal 2010 crash, police reports show. He will be criminally tried March 6, facing charges of DUI manslaughter, vehicular homicide, and leaving the scene of a crash. He could spend up to 30 years in prison if found guilty, the Palm Beach Post reports. The civil trial will be some weeks later on March 27. Goodman’s civil attorney Dan Bachi told myfoxorlando.com that the adoption was meant to secure the assets of his children and family investments, nothing more. ‘It has nothing to do with the lawsuit currently pending against him,’ Mr Bachi said. Goodman’s father was the late Harold Goodman, who built a fortune from a heating and air conditioning manufacturing business. His family sold the business in 2004 for a reported $1.4 billion. He converted his father’s horse farm into a polo ranch and later began building his empire. His club became a magnate for the rich and famous, entertaining the likes of Prince Charles and Princess Diana, Zsa Zsa Gabor, Sylvester Stallone, and Charlton Heston. Even Madonna was spotted at the club, attending an International Polo Club match in 2009. Goodman’s wealth is a point of a heated dispute. The Palm Beach New Times questioned the heir’s true assets, quoting Mr Wilson’s lawyer. Attorney Chris Searcy said Goodman is much richer than his financial documents show. He is seeking punitive damages that will ‘sting (Goodman) badly without bankrupting him,’ Mr Searcy told the New Times. Celebrity hot spot: John Goodman and Hilary Duff, left, pose with an elephant At International Polo Club annual Polo Ball black-tie gala in 2007 . According to the website, Mr Searcy thinks Goodman’s wealth is buried in numerous trusts and companies, and is as ‘sophisticated’ a method as he’s ever seen. The financial battle has been closely tied to the wrongful death suit. In 2002, the mogul sold his Wellington estate to his children’s trust fund for $3.8million, according to the New Times. But he only rents it for $2,000 per month. According to an August 2011 report by the Palm Beach Post, his two children have more than $200 million in their trust funds. Mr Searcy suspects he has full control over those trusts. Mr Searcy also said in court that Goodman has an airplane, yacht, polo ponies, and an unspecified amount of his father’s $1.4billion fortune from Goodman Manufacturing. Lap of luxury: The International Polo Club attracts A-list celebrities . Home sweet home: Goodman sold his Wellington mansion to his children's trust for $3.8million and now pays $2,000/month rent . In a 2006 document, Goodman claimed one of his trusts was worth more than $100 million. Mr Searcy pointed out that Goodman claimed in 2011 that trust was only worth $6.9 million. The Wilsons have already settled privately with the Player’s Club, a bar in Wellington where Goodman had been drinking in February 2010. They claimed that the club was partially responsible for the crash because they served Goodman even though he was intoxicated. Lifestyles of the rich and famous: Goodman owns the International Polo Club Palm Beach in Wellington, Florida . The bartenders deposed that Goodman wasn’t noticeably drunk. Goodman divorced his first wife Isla Carroll in 2008 after 22 years of marriage. In the April 2009 divorce filing, Ms Carroll said she was fearful for the safety of herself as well as her children. Jeanne T. Tate, a fellow of the American Academy of Adoption Attorneys, has been practicing adoption law for nearly 30 years. She told MailOnline that while nothing illegal was done when John Goodman adopted his girlfriend, she’s seen many cases where adoption ‘is used for purposes other than what you’d traditionally think it was intended.’ In Florida, adult adoptions do not have the same requirements as traditional child adoptions. She explained: ‘A lot of the traditional adoption statutes- including home studies – those protections are eliminated when you’re adopting an adult, with less government intrusion being the goal.’ She said the only people who have to consent in an adult adoption are the adoptee and the adopter. Under Florida law, they do have to give notice of the adoption, though Ms Tate notes that parental consent is not required. ‘The court may not have been aware of many things,’ she said, ‘including that there was a pending wrongful death suit, or that she was a girlfriend.’ When asked if is now legal for Goodman to have sex with his daughter, Ms Tate responded: ‘That’s a good question. I’m not a criminal lawyer, but it’s a solid question to wonder about.’ She said that because they’re both adults and not biologically related, the question’s answer is murky. ‘Creepy,’ she said,’ but I don’t know if that’s illegal.’ Attorney Wayne Richter told MailOnline that under Florida law, the statutory has no law against having sex with an adopted child as long as there is no lineal consanguinity - meaning there is no close blood tie, such as aunt, uncle, niece, or nephew. Ms Tate said that should Goodman wish to marry Ms Hutchins after the criminal case, it would be a difficult endeavour. The statute, she said, is permanent in the eyes of the law. ‘Even for fraud of duress, you have to bring the challenges in front of the court.’ In Florida, all adoption papers are sealed and cannot be viewed by reporters or third parties. ‘A court could order the file open,’ Ms Tate said,’ but it is difficult to do’ – in most cases because of the sensitive nature of protecting identities. Ms Hutchins could in theory, with the consent of Goodman, be re-adopted by her parents and then marry him, Ms Tate said.During Goodman’s civil case, Ms Tate said the court could open the adoption file and examine if there was any fraud on the court or the adoptee (Ms Hutchins). She added: ‘There’s nothing illegal, per se, about adopting your girlfriend.’ Watch the video here: .","John Goodman, 48, adopted his 42-year-old girlfriend Heather Hutchins last October; couple began dating in 2009 .

"Scientists have developed a crude form of telepathy in animals by enabling a pair of rats to pass instructions using only their mind. Using microchips implanted in their brains to communicate, the rats were able to collaborate and solve simple puzzles, even though in one experiment they were thousands of miles apart. Researchers claim this is the first example of a 'brain-to-brain interface', raising the prospect that one day animals - and humans - could be able to read each other's minds. Scroll down for video . Researchers electronically tied the brains of two rats, one in the U.S (right)  and another in Brazil (left), allowing them to solve problems together . The rats were connected to each other via a special interface which plugged directly into their brain . The team from Duke University in . North Carolina said: 'As far as we can tell, these findings demonstrate . for the first time that a direct channel for behavioural information . exchange can be established between two animals' brains without the use . of the animal's regular forms of communication.' Lead researcher, Miguel . Nicolelis, a pioneer of research into brain-computer interfaces, said . the study was the first step towards the linking of multiple minds to . form an 'organic computer' or 'brain-net' that would allow sharing of . information among groups of animals. 'We cannot even predict what kinds of . emergent properties would appear when animals begin interacting as part . of a brain-net,' he said. 'In theory, you could imagine that a . combination of brains could provide solutions that individual brains . cannot achieve by themselves.' He said it could even lead to one animal . incorporating another's sense of 'self', although there are fears it . could result in the development of mind control. In the experiments, published in the . journal Scientific Reports, microscopic electrodes implanted into the . rats' brains enabled one animal to pass on instructions to the other, . even though it was in a separate cage. The first rat, known as the . 'encoder', was taught to find water in its cage by responding to a light . and pressing a particular lever. Its brain was connected to a second . animal, known as the 'decoder', which was not given the light signals. Instead, the second animal relied . solely on the brain instructions, but when stimulated still pressed the . right lever to receive a reward 70 per cent of the time - far more often . than it would have by chance, demonstrating they had been guided by the . other rat's mind. A still from a video released by Nicolelis Laboratory explaining the logistics of the experiment . Remarkably, the communication between . the rats seemed to be two-way. The encoder rat did not receive a full . reward if the decoder made a wrong choice, and as a result, became more . decisive and generated clearer brain signals. 'We saw that when the decoder rat . committed an error, the encoder basically changed both its brain . function and behaviour to make it easier for its partner to get it . right,' said Dr Nicolelis, who claimed this suggested a 'behavioral . collaboration' between the pair of rats. Duke University Medical Center neurobiologist Miguel Nicolelis led the study,  published in Scientific Reports . A second test involved pairs of rats . distinguishing between narrow and wide openings using their whiskers. Again, signals transmitted from one rat helped the other take the . right action to obtain a reward. Evidence from this study suggested . that the decoder rat began to develop a double identity, by picking up . sensations from two sets of whiskers - its own and those of its partner. 'Our studies of the sensory cortex of . the decoder rats in these experiments showed that the decoder's brain . began to represent in its tactile cortex not only its own whiskers, but . the encoder rat's whiskers, too,' said Dr Nicolelis. Microscopic electrodes implanted into the . rats' brains enabled one animal to pass on instructions to the other, . even though it was in a separate cage. The first rat, known as the . 'encoder', was taught to find water in its cage by responding to a light . and pressing a particular lever. Its brain was connected to a second . animal, known as the 'decoder', which was not given the light signals. Instead, the second animal relied . solely on the brain instructions, but when stimulated still pressed the . right lever to receive a reward 70 per cent of the time - far more often . than it would have by chance, demonstrating they had been guided by the . other rat's mind. 'We detected . cortical neurons that responded to both sets of whiskers.' This . experiment was repeated with another pair of rats, one in the US city of . Durham, North Carolina, the other in Natal, Brazil. By recording brain signals from one . rat and transmitting them over the internet to the other, scientists . were able to alter the second rodent's behaviour despite the vast . distance. British expert Professor Christopher . James, from the University of Warwick, who has conducted similar . research, said: 'We are far from a scenario of well-networked rats . around the world uniting to take us over, the stimulation is crude and . specific. 'As for the ethics, I struggle to think of any applications . that would not have ethical issues.'","Researchers linked a rat in the US city of Durham, North Carolina, with another in Natal, Brazil .

"The legal high known as ‘hippy crack’ was used by one in 16 young people, according to new figures. The first data to be released on the use of nitrous oxide reveals more than six per cent, or 350,000  people aged 16-24 year used the drug last year. Better known as laughing gas, it is a regular fixture as a legal party and festival drug and is the second most popular drug among young people. Legal high: Discarded Nitrous Oxide canisters and balloons used for inhaling abandoned in campsites at the Glastonbury Festival . On a downer: Illegal drug use has fallen, particularly for cocaine and ecstasy, latest figures show . Nitrous oxide is inhaled to make people feel euphoric and relaxed - but drug experts warn it can cause death on first time use through suffocation. For the first time the 2012-13 Crime Survey for England and Wales included questions about the use of the drug. It is often sold to recreational users in balloons in nightclubs and at parties. Cheap, seemingly harmless and guaranteeing a night of raucous laughter, so-called 'hippy crack' is increasingly popular with celebrities and their well-heeled young fans alike. Home office minister Jeremy Browne said drug use in England and Wales was at a record low . Even Prince Harry was seen indulging two years ago. The survey also asked participants about herbal high salvia, also known as Mexican magic mint. It found that some 6.1 per cent of . adults aged 16 to 24 had taken nitrous oxide, while 1.1 per cent had . taken salvia in the last year. However overall drug use in England and Wales is at the lowest level since records began. The Home Office reported that around 8.2 per cent of 16 to 59-year-olds used an illicit drug in the last year, compared with 11.1 per cent in 1996. And the proportion of adults who took a class A drug has dropped from 3 per cent in 2011-12 to 2.6 per cent. Home Office Minister Jeremy Browne wrote to summer festival organisers earlier this year highlighting the Government's concerns about the availability of nitrous oxide and asking that they take steps to prevent its sale at events. Today Mr Browne said: ‘Today’s report shows drug usage in England and Wales is at its lowest level since records began. ‘This, coupled with the record number of people leaving drug treatment programmes free from dependency, is really positive news.’ A survey on attitudes also revealed that almost four out of five - or 79 per cent- of respondents thought taking cannabis was unsafe. Two-thirds thought it was never acceptable to take cannabis and the majority said it was unsafe to take heroin, cocaine or ecstasy. A Home Office spokesman said: 'Nitrous . oxide is a legal substance which has a number of legitimate medical and . industrial uses but any suggestion of abuse, particularly by young . people is of concern. '""Like all drugs there are health risks and nitrous oxide should not be experimented with.'","1 in 16 16-24 year olds used nitrous oxide last year, Home Office says .

"A rabbi from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania is being sued for severing a newborn baby's penis during a botched Bris ceremony. Rabbi Mordechai Rosenberg, who is also a mohel, performed the ceremony at The Tree Of Life Synagogue in Squirrel Hill earlier this year on April 28. The Huffington Post reported that the parents have remained anonymous to protect the identity of their son. Rabbi Mordechai Rosenberg is a rabbi, and a mohel who claimed to be 'trained,' yet managed to accidentally dismember a baby's penis . The newborn baby boy had to be rushed to Children's Hospital where doctors performed an emergency micro-surgery to reattach the dismembered penis. CBS reported that the boy needed six blood transfusions and was hospitalized for two months. The delicate surgery took about eight hours long. CBS spoke with a plastic surgeon named Doctor Joe Losee about the process of micro surgery. 'If your finger, your thumb was cut off and was put back on, that is pretty exciting,' Losee said. 'Sometimes, it doesn’t always work,' he says. “When you’re reattaching a portion where you include nerves, sometimes the nerves don’t heal well beyond where you reattached it. So there are limitations for sure.' The baby's microsurgery was reported 'successful', but whether or not the baby will have problems later on in life is still unknown. Despite the gruesome incident, the rabbi still practices as a mohel. CBS spoke with attorney David Llewellyn who handles cases pertaining to botched circumcisions by either a mohel or a doctor. There is no regulated method for training mohel's that perform the bris . The Bris was performed at The Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania . 'That is extraordinarily serious and is extraordinarily rare,' said attorney David Llewellyn. He spoke of how Bris services are usually unregulated. 'There’s virtually no regulation of this any place in the United States that I know of,' Llewellyn said. 'I think the government probably should require some sort of training if this is going to be done.' 'Your average pediatric urologist probably spends about 20 percent of his or her time repairing children who have been circumcised,' Llewellyn told CBS. According to Rosenberg's website, 'The Bris must be performed by a Jewish person who understands, upholds, and practices the tenets of the Jewish religion, and is specially trained to function as a mohel.' Rosenberg claims he is well trained in circumcision and calls this case a 'tragic accident.' He also claims that receiving a Bris in a hospital may not be recognized under Jewish law. Mayor Bloomberg has spoken out about medical circumcision following 11 herpes outbreaks in 2001 in New York in an ultra-Orthodox Jewish circumcision ritual called metzitzah b’peh — or oral suction — in which the mohel puts his mouth directly on the newborn’s circumcised penis and sucks out the blood. The mohel had transmitted herpes to the children. Bloomberg wrote an open latter to mohel's asking them to move away from the ceremony. The surgery lasted for 8 hours and the baby needed 6 blood transfusions . Rosenberg's website claims he is 'specially trained in the medical and surgical technique of circumcision'","The child had to have micro-surgery, was in the hospital for two months, and required a blood transfusion .

"Dubai, the Middle East emirate that thinks big, is building the world’s largest man-made lagoon to stretch across 40 turquoise hectares. Developer Crystal Lagoons expects to finish the project by 2020 and take the Guinness World Record. The lagoon will have a Caribbean feel and is expected to dwarf a 12-hectare lagoon already built in the Egyptian resort of Sharm El Sheikh, the current title holder. Dubai plans to build the world's largest man-made lagoon, stretching across 40 hectares and dwarfing the 12 hectare site in Egypt which currently holds the record. The . lagoon will include wide beaches and offer swimming and water sports in clear, filtered water - reportedly using just one per cent of the chemicals used in more traditional systems. Earlier this week, Dubai ruler Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid also . unveiled plans for the Dubai Water Canal Project, with a 2.8-kilometre elevated . waterway that will stretch from Dubai's Business Bay to the shore at Jumeirah. The projects may mark a turning point . for Dubai, which roiled markets with its request to delay $25 billion of . debt payments in 2009. Dubai is also bidding to hold the Expo 2020 World Fair and needs about $7.1b of infrastructure spending in order to host the event, according to a report this week by Bloomberg. Dubai hopes to set a new record for the world's largest lagoon, near the Jumeirah Beach Hotel, and other Dubai attractions . A lagoon and a canal will be built in Dubai by 2020 . The lagoon plan is the most ambitious project of its kind so far from developer Crystal Lagoons Corp., which has offices in Florida, Chile, the Middle East and Asia. The bay will form part of the the upscale Mohammad Bin Rashid City residential community development now underway. Luxury residences, shopping, dining and recreational facilities are part of the project. The lagoon will cover 40 hectares, more than three times larger than the world’s biggest man-made lagoon in Egypt . Crystal Lagoons claims it will use up to 100 times fewer chemicals than traditional pool systems and just two per cent of the energy required by conventional filtering technologies . The lagoon will form an integral part of the $7 billion Mohammed Bin Rashid City . Crystal Lagoons’ 250 projects include five Middle East based developments including lagoons in the Egyptian resort of Sharm El Sheikh .

"A grandmother who had been left disabled by a stroke died after she choked on her dinner which care home staff should have cut up for her. Partially sighted Mavis Clarkson, 78, who was unable to cut up her own food, died two days after she choked on roast lamb at Longton Nursing and Residential Home near Preston, Lancashire. Yesterday a coroner recorded a verdict of accidental death, but said that neglect was a factor in Mrs Clarkson's death, and criticised care home staff's 'gross failure' in preventing it. Mavis Clarkson, 78, pictured with her husband of 58 years, Trevor, died after choking in council care home . After the inquest, the mother of three's family condemned staff at the 58-bed, local authority-run home for failing to help the retired machinist. The inquest heard that staff knew Mrs Clarkson's food needed to be cut up because a stroke had affected her left side, but had failed to do so. Coroner Simon Jones blasted failings by the staff at Longton, saying they contributed to Mrs Clarkson's death in July last year and vowing to write a report about procedures at the home. He added: 'I'm satisfied the risks posed by the lack of a structured meal plan amount to a gross failure.' Speaking outside the inquest, Mrs Clarkson's husband of 58 years, Trevor, and their children David, Susan and Amanda said they saw the coroner's verdict as justice for their mother. And they said the verdict was significant not only for their family, but for relatives of other care home residents. Preston coroner Simon Jones blasted staff at Longton residential home, pictured, for their 'gross failure' Mr Clarkson said: 'The saddest thing is she was coming home to us - she was in the home and we made necessary preparations and did work to bring her home.' His daughter, Susan, added: 'For the last 15 months we have worked to get this verdict.  Justice has been done, not just for her, but for other people in nursing homes. 'The week before she died we had taken her for a drink at the pub with her grandchildren. It's a lovely precious memory.' They described Mrs Clarkson, who enjoyed going on safaris and cruises, as adventurous and 'a brilliant mum.' The care home has not responded to MailOnline's request for a comment.","Mavis Clarkson was disabled and partially-sighted having had a stroke .

"Charlie Sheen has placed himself front and center in the  in the Philadelphia restaurant versus LeSean McCoy kerfuffle. The Two and a Half Men star tweeted his support Wednesday to stiffed PYT server Rob Knelly in the form of a $1000 tip. That should more than make up for the 20 cents he received from the Eagles running back on a check that totaled over $60. 'dear Tommy Up,' Sheen tweeted Wednesday afternoon, referring to the owner of the Philly burger joint. 'Please tell Rob K I'm pledging 1000 dollars to him for the tip debacle just wanna help. c' Pledging to help: Charlie Sheen has added his two cents to the LeSean McCoy tipping row in the form of $1000 pledged to the stiffed Philadelphia waiter . McCoy was first publicly called out by the owner of a local eatery for leaving a 20-cent tip on a bill totaling more than $60. The Philadelphia burger joint PYT shared a receipt online showing what was described as Mr McCoy's paltry tip. 'The twenty cent tip that the Eagles' LeSean McCoy just left our server on his $60 check is going to come in really handy for that new official NFL McCoy jersey he had his heart set on,' the message that accompanied the receipt read. 'That is a .03% tip. New record!' Paltry tip: The owner of Philadelphia's PYT burger joint shared this receipt from Monday showing the 20-cent tip that Eagles star LeSean McCoy left for a server on a $61.56 tab . Unsatisfied customer: PYT server Rob Knelly (left) indicated that the meager tip did not come as a surprise given that LeSean McCoy (right) and his friends were rude and disrespectful from the moment they sat down . According to the document in question, McCoy and three guests patronized PYT on North Hancock Street at around 3pm Monday, ordering $57 worth of food, plus $4.56 in taxes. McCoy paid the tab with his Visa credit card, writing in by hand a '$00.20' tip for a grand total of $61.76. McCoy's party of four was served that day by a waiter named Rob, identified later in an NJ.com article as Rob Knelly. The PYT staffer revealed to the paper that LeSean McCoy and his guests were being loud and rude from the moment they sat down at the table. ‘I kept my cool for as long as I could, where you just don’t want them yelling and cursing you,’ Knelly, who is a Baltimore Raves fan, said. ‘I asked some questions; they weren't really responsive. They were cursing, making derogatory comments. I put their order in and forgot one of their appetizers, which I apologized for. They ordered things and, once they got it, said “We ain't eating this s***. We don't want it.""’ After giving the patrons’ drink orders to the bartender, Knelly said McCoy and his party continued to call for him. ‘They didn’t know my name,’ Knelly told NBC Philadelphia. ‘They just said, “you’re my server right?” They were being rude so after I gave them their food I didn’t go back to them until they were done. I just avoided their rudeness.’ Fast-food landmark: Tommy Up, the owner of the popular eatery, wrote on Facebook that everyone at PYT was excited to see McCoy, but he responded by making derogatory comments and mistreating the staff . When a Philadelphia Daily News reporter reached out to McCoy for comment, the NFL player said, 'It's bull****, man,' but he declined to further elaborate on the tip controversy. In 2012, LeSean McCoy signed a five-year contract extension with the Eagles worth $45million. Slip-up: Knelly admitted that he forgot to bring an appetizer for the group, but apologized for his mistake . The image of the receipt posted on PYT’s Facebook by the owner has been shared more than 2,800 times, drawing sharp criticism from many commenters for calling out McCoy as a bad tipper. User Taryn Woods wrote: ‘This is very distasteful and unprofessional of PYT. So what if the man left a .20 cent tip? It’s his right to be cheap or more than likely disappointed with the service.’ Another Facebook commenter Phil Penny wondered: ‘is there a minimum we should tip to avoid you posting receipts online?’ In response to the firestorm, the proprietor of the burger joint, Tommy Up, penned a lengthy status update Tuesday afternoon offering his side of the story. Mr Up opened his letter by taking full responsibility for sharing the receipt online and saying that he stands firmly by his staff. He then went on to describe how ‘pumped’ his employees – many of them loyal Eagles fans – were to see the famed running back walk through the doors of their establishment. ‘Mr McCoy and his friend sat inside at a booth next to my management and next to me. They were given excellent service. Impeccable service. If anything, our server was a little nervous as was our food runner, because they are big, big fans,’ the owner wrote. Millionaire's response: The running back, who signed a five-year contract extension with the Eagles worth $45million in 2012, responded to the tip-gate by saying the eatery's claims were 'bull****' ‘He and his group, from the moment they sat down, were verbally abusive to our staff in the most insulting ways. The derogatory statements about women and their sheer contempt for the staff serving them wasn't the end, however. ‘After Mr McCoy and his group left I looked over and saw their server, my friend, with his head bowed down and with a very confused look on his face. I took the receipt out of his hand and I couldn't believe that anyone could be so callous. Mr McCoy had left a .03% tip for our staff. ‘Our staff that was beyond excited to see him walk into our burger joint and was excited to serve him. That's twenty cents on a tab of over $60. Twenty cents that our server has to split with the food runner and the bartender. Two dimes from an insulting multimillionaire. The owner went on to dismiss reports the McCoy and his party received poor service as ‘a complete slanderous lie.’ ‘At the end of the day, I did what I felt my heart told me to do. And I don't want anything from Mr McCoy, but...maybe an apology to his server who gave him excellent service would be cool,’ Mr Up summed up, before directing all hate mail to his email address.","Sheen tweeted his support for PYT server Rob Knelly on Monday afternoon .

"It is the definitive piece of First World War propaganda. Intense, arresting eyes loom from the moustachioed face of Lord Kitchener, Secretary of State for War in 1914, his stern face and pointing finger above the words 'Your country needs YOU!' His call to arms, as the fighting in Europe was just beginning almost a century ago, was answered by more than two million Britons – many of whom would never return. Difference: The Lord Kitchener image, left, was based on a 1896 photograph (right). However, it had several modifications, including removing the War Secretary's squint . Original: Alfred Leete drew the drawing of Lord Kitchener for the London Opinion magazine in 1914 . But the poster, much imitated around the world, was a masterpiece of artistic licence. In particularly the commanding eyes – an enduring symbol of authority – were pure invention as Lord Kitchener had a pronounced squint in his left eye. Alfred Leete, a magazine illustrator who never met Kitchener, threw together the design in a few hours from a postcard dating from 1895. In the process of drawing he also made the face squarer and thickened the moustache. The original version of the Kitchener drawing was not meant for a poster, but was the front cover image for the mass-circulation London Opinion magazine on September 5 1914 . The Government was running a recruitment poster campaign at the time, but its adverts were walls of text outlining pay and conditions of service. Reproduced: The famous image was seized upon by the Government, who printed thousands of copies to encourage recruits . However, after seeing the powerful image on the front of the magazine, those in authority seized upon it and produced thousands of copies, which ended up on walls and billboards across the UK. Martyn Thatcher, an artist who has written a book about the poster, said: 'Kitchener himself was what they called at the time called squinty-eyed – one eye looked straight at you and the other eye, unfortunately, looked up the chimney. Prolific: The posters were hung in locations across Britain, such as above in Chester Castle . Recruitment drive: The poster can also be seen in the above image of a tram in Ulster . 'People commented on his gaze but it was more the uncomfortable feeling that they had when looking at the guy', he told BBC Radio Northampton. As a test Mr Thatcher replaced the face in the poster with a more accurate version of Kitchener, and found that people hardly responded to the tweaked version at all. But the polished and edited version, distributed nationwide, had an irresistible effect on many young men in the early days of the war. Minted: The image was chosen to appear on a commemorative £2 coin earlier this year . A report from The Times in 1915 described the scenes in central London: 'Posters appealing to recruits are to be seen on every hoarding, in most windows, in omnibuses, tramcars and commercial vans.' 'Their number and variety are remarkable. Everywhere Lord Kitchener sternly points a monstrously big finger, exclaiming 'I Want You'"" Speaking to MailOnline, Mr Thatcher said that many hopeful recruits would have been particularly taken in due to an implicit trust of authority figures. Legacy: The Kitchener poster later inspired the iconic Uncle Sam image used in the U.S. He said: 'A guy in authority saying “We want you” – back then people jumped, they did what they were told. 'This man, obviously senior with a well-known name pointed his finger, and they wouldn't even question that. Do that today and people would tell you where to get off.' Mr Leete's design proved so effective that it was picked up in other countries to fire separate recruitment campaigns. European powers even produced versions to inspire soldiers to fight on behalf of Germany and her allies using similar designs. However, the most enduring imitation is the Uncle Sam image used to encourage recruits into the United States army – reproduced three years later in time for the American entry to the First World War in 1917. The poster was based directly on the Kitchener design, and was reproduced more than four million times, and used in a slightly altered form to encourage sign-ups in the United States for the Second World War. The design was given an extra nod of recognition at the start of the year when the Royal Mint announced that it would feature the poster design on a commemorative £2 in honour of the First World War centenary. However, it was immediately criticsed on social media for promoting 'jingoism' over remembrance.","War Minister Lord Kitchener's image was used in recruitment campaigns .

"Homeless people in Hawaii are facing the prospect of being moved on or even arrested if they try to sit or lie down in certain parts of Hawaii after new legislation was enacted on Wednesday. The Honolulu City Council approved a plethora of measures which they hope will lead to a decrease in the numbers of homeless people in areas that are popular with tourists. The most notable of the measures passed includes one that prohibits sitting and lying down on sidewalks in the Waikiki area. Down and out: A homeless man in Honolulu, Hawaii is pictured with his belongings . Contrast: Sunbathers enjoying Waikiki Beach (left) while  a homeless man sleeps near the beach (right) The new bill also prohibits urinating and defecating in public throughout the island of Oahu. The council defended their decision to introduce the legislation as they said the tourism industry had demanded action in relation to safety and human waste concerns. There had been some calls for a ban on sitting and lying down on sidewalks throughout the island but this measure was not passed. Helene 'Sam' Shenkus, marketing director of the Royal Hawaiian Center, told The Associated Press that visitors had 'an expectation' for Waikiki and for Hawaii. She added: 'It's a dream. And because they're families and it's their money, they don't have to come here.' Nowhere to go: Homeless man Jim Trevarthen, 62, watches surfers near Waikiki Beach in Honolulu . Local man Jim Trevarthen was once a surf instructor on Hawaii's renowned Waikiki Beach but now he is one of the many homeless people who are being moved away from Hawaii's renowned tourist areas. Mr Trevarthen suffered the ignominy of homelessness when his landlord increased his rent and cancelled his lease. In stark contrast to his surf instructor days Mr Trevarthen said he now spends his time looking for meals and for places where he can sleep away from the prying eyes of the police who routinely move him on. The reason for a clampdown is the hotel industry is eager to keep Waikiki as an attractive visitor destination, according to Jesse Broder Van Dyke, a spokesman for Mayor Kirk Caldwell. Isolated: A homeless camp is set up near Kiholo Bay in Hawaii . Tourist mecca: Sunset at famous Waikiki Beach, which attracts lots of tourists . Hawaii is a welcoming paradise to the influx of visiting tourists but Mr Trevarthen said him and the other homeless people in the 50th US state are not made to feel so welcome. Mr Van Dyke said they had pushed to make it illegal to sleep on the sidewalks of Waikiki because it was damaging the local tourism industry. He added, 'We've heard from our hotel industry that it's very concerned about keeping Waikiki as an attractive visitor destination.' A proposal has been put forward to move the homeless population to Sand Island, an isolated industrial island and a former internment camp during World War II. Mr Van Dyke said Mayor Caldwell deals with varying complaints from holidaymakers on a weekly basis which relate to threatening behaviour and public urination. Paradise island: A bird's eye view of Waikiki Beach with Diamond Head crater on the right . Mike McCartney, president and CEO of the Hawaii Tourism Authority, said Waikiki has seen a significant increase in homeless people who sit and lie on the sidewalks and subsequently restrict tourists from accessing the walkways and businesses. Bishop Stephen Randolph Sykes told mashable.com that sitting and lying on sidewalks had been a Hawaiian tradition since King Kamehameha I, who reigned in the early 19th Century. He encouraged the Hawaiian people to lie by the roadside and he said they should be able to do so without fear of harm. Bishop Sykes said he recognised Waikiki as the economic engine of Hawaii and having their homeless people situated in the vicinity of the area was not something that was beneficial. He added: 'But creating an island-wide type of situation where we're criminalising homelessness is just not ""pono."" It's not ethical, because these people don't have any place to go, and we're just pushing them around.'

"A rail firm has been given a contract to provide services for another four years even though a union leader said 40 per cent of its trains ran late last year. Southeastern was also rated worst out of 23 rail firms for passenger satisfaction in a report by watchdogs three months ago. But the company, operated by Go-Ahead, will continue running services between London, Kent and parts of East Sussex until June 2018, the Government said. Southeastern was rated worst out of 23 rail firms for passenger satisfaction in a report by watchdogs three months ago (file picture) Rail unions last night said ‘fat cat’ rail bosses were being rewarded for failure. Go-Ahead chief executive David Brown saw his pay, perks and bonus package more than double from £942,000 last year to £1.96million this year. Mick Cash, acting general secretary of the RMT rail union, condemned the extended franchise deal as ‘a reward for total and abject failure’. Manuel Cortes, leader of the TSSA union, added: ‘Nothing succeeds like failure if you are Southeastern. Our real time arrival figures showed this week that 40 per cent of their trains arrived late last year.’ A survey by rail customer watchdog Passenger Focus in June found 45 per cent of Southeastern’s passengers considered their ticket either poor or unsatisfactory in terms of value for money – the highest dissatisfaction level among the UK train companies. Rail minister Claire Perry said: ‘I know passengers on this route haven’t always received the service that they deserve, which is why I am determined that today marks a fresh start for the Southeastern franchise.’ That includes more than 95,000 extra seats across the network. Mr Brown promised more staff on stations, a spruce-up of trains, more ticket machines and better station security. the company, operated by Go-Ahead, will continue running services between London, Kent and parts of East Sussex until June 2018, the Government said (file picture)","Southeastern ranked worst out of 23 rail firms for passenger satisfaction .

"Sami Khedira arrived in Germany on Friday to watch his brother Rani play for Leipzig, sparking suggestions that he is about to join Bayern Munich. The German's current club Real Madrid took on local rivals Atletico  in Friday's Spanish Super Cup, but Khedira was not named in the squad and was allowed to leave the country by manager Carlo Ancelotti . Khedira has made it plain that he wants to leave Los Blancos, but it is unclear whether Bayern's manager Pep Guardiola is interested in the World Cup winning midfielder. Scroll down for video . On his way: Sami Khedira looks set to leave the Bernabeu, and could be joining Bayern Munich . Disgruntled: Khedira is angry that Real will not meet his contract demands . Sportsmail understands that Khedira is not Guardiola's first choice for the central midfield position, which could put the breaks on the deal. The Bayern manager does not always get his own way however, and was left frustrated by the departure of Toni Kroos to Real Madrid this summer, so it may be that Khedira will join the club even if the Spaniard is not entirely sure about him. Unsure: It is understood that Bayern's manager Pep Guardiola is not totally convinced by Khedira . The injury to Javi Martinez, who is ruled out for the whole season with a cruciate ligament injury, has also reduced Guardiola's options in midfield and made signing a central midfielder more pressing. Khedira had been linked with a move to the Premier League earlier in the summer, with Chelsea, Manchester United and Arsenal all reportedly interested, but no firm bid has yet been made.

"A £500,000-a-year broker lost an unfair dismissal lawsuit against his firm - after a judge ruled he gave ‘often gave worse than he got’ on a trading floor rife with ‘homophobic, racist and sexist’ insults. Robert Bou-Simon, who worked for BGC Partners in Canary Wharf, east London, was ‘not the only object of ridicule and insult or the sole victim of the abuse’, an employment tribunal judge said. Conversations between staff on instant messenger services were often abusive, but the comments were seen as ‘banter - a word which seems to cover a multitude of sins,’ according to the judge. Scroll down for video .

The Australian, who was head of the US firm's basis swaps desk, had claimed the bullying began when he refused to take part in an initiation ritual after he joined the company in February 2012. This was known as ‘The Run’ and involved sprinting across the office after making a first trade while colleagues doused him in water, reported Bloomberg journalist Kit Chellel. He claimed colleagues forced him to quit in June 2013 following a campaign of bulling - and Anthony Herbert, who would go on to replace him, had written in a message: ‘I’m going to destroy Bob.’ The tribunal in May this year was also told how Mr Bou-Simon claimed to have been victimised and taunted about his support for Chelsea Football Club and an Australian rugby team.

She also found that colleagues were ‘disillusioned’ with him because he bullied junior brokers, reported Daily Telegraph journalist Claire Duffin. And it turned out that Mr Bou-Simon also took part in using ‘personally insulting and obscene language towards others’ on the instant message service. Mr Bou-Simon was hired on a salary of £500,000, which was later halved to £250,000 after he failed to live up to a promise that he would ‘turn one million dollars a month’. Ruling: Judge Bernice Elgot said that because desk revenue had fallen under Mr Bou-Simon's leadership, he had 'exposed himself to a lack of respect in this particular working culture' The judge said his employment ‘did not work out’ and there were ‘high expectations on both sides’. Mr Bou-Simon had also worked for BGC from 2000 to 2005 but left in ‘difficult’ circumstances. He then worked for GFI Brokers before returning to BGC. He now works for Vantage Capital Markets. He has previously lived in a two-bedroom penthouse in Fulham, south-west London, worth £1.15million, and a modern building in the City of London where flats go for up to £900,000.

"They make elegance look effortless when they step on to the red carpet. Now Helen Mirren and Meryl Streep have been credited with inspiring older women to embrace more youthful fashion. Next said its clothing sales have been boosted by older customers wanting to wear the latest trends and copy their celebrity role models’ ageless style. Scroll down for video . Despite the 43 year age gap between the two Helen Mirren looks just as good in a floor length red lace dress as 23-year-old singer Rita Ora .

It claimed women around the age of 60 are now choosing the same items as those aged 40 and under, as the generations become blurred. Chief executive Lord Wolfson said that while older customers might once have shied away from certain styles, they no longer see their age as a barrier. ‘There is no longer the same fashion cut-off of a few years ago,’ he said. ‘I don’t think people nowadays think, “I can’t buy that”. Age is becoming less of a determining factor. As our business grows we are seeing more customers come in of different ages – and an increasing proportion don’t see their age as preventing them following trends.’ Meryl Streep has a patriotic moment in the same Catherine Malandrino stars and stripes shirt dress worn by 35-year-old actress Tatyana Ali . Meryl Streep made a bold choice for the 2012 Academy Awards, opting for a gold Lanvin dress with a plunging neckline, rivalling the fashion credentials of much younger stars like Hilary Swank . Meryl Streep, 65, shows off her shoulders in a Stella McCartney creation at the Screen Actors Guild Awards and Kate Moss, 40, stepping out in London today in black skinny jeans and a leopard print scarf . Fashion expert Gemma Champ said many women now stay physically active into their old age, meaning they have the confidence to carry off younger designs. She added: ‘No one wants to dress like an old lady. 60-year-olds are not that old these days – they are young and fit and still working. ‘Many grew up in the 1960s and 1970s and had a good time. They are not ready to go into perms and blue rinses.’ She said that while the previous generation may have looked to their mothers for fashion advice, today’s older women are more likely to copy their daughters. 69-year-old Helen Mirren pictured promoting her latest film in an elegant white satin dress which had a black floral pattern running throughout and 40-year-old Eva Mendes launching her vintage-inspired fashion line earlier this year . The film stars' style on and off the red carpet has inspired women in their 60s to wear younger fashions . Lord Wolfson also revealed Next is planning a new fashion range, featuring dresses costing up to £150. Men’s suits will also be included, retailing at up to £300. But he said this was a small range, and not a wider move upmarket for the chain.","Clothing sales have been boosted by older customers wanting to wear the latest trends .

"It is 20 years since Vanity Fair first published its New Establishment list marking the cultural shift in American life away from an industrial economy to one more centered around technology and entertainment. Eagerly anticipated and now required reading, the list of 93 marks out those firmly in charge of shaping the current zeitgeist, 'The Powers that Be' and those who threaten to break into this exclusive club, 'The Disrupters'. Both lists are dominated by white men, with 30 billionaires and 36 new entries, with news moguls such as Rupert Murdoch and Michael Bloomberg firmly entrenched inside the top ten. Top dogs: Rupert Murdoch topped Vanity Fair's 'The Powers that Be' top 25 while Tesla Motors visionary, Elon Musk (right) was named number one in 'The Disrupters' list in the magazine's annual 'New Establishment' list . Indeed, Murdoch has been the only constant member of the 'Powers that Be' list since its inception, with newcomer and Silicon Valley's resident visionary, Elon Musk topping out the 'Disrupters'. Tech-giants dominate the 'Disrupters', with Google's Larry Page and Sergey Brin at number two, and Apple's Tim Cook and British design guru Jonathan Ive at number three. Facebook's 30-year-old Mark Zuckerberg is at five with Pinterest's 32-year-old chief Ben Silbermann topping out a top ten entirely comprised of men. The first of only five women in a list of 50 'Disrupters' is Zuckerberg's Chief Financial Officer at Facebook, Sheryl Sandberg. Number two: Google's Larry Page and Sergey Brin, both 41, stay at number two in Vanity Fair's list of Disrupters . Disrupters: Apple CEO and design guru Jonathan Ive (right) placed at number three on the list of those disrupting the current establishment . Highest women: Facebook's Sheryl Sandberg (left) comes in at 12 on the disrupters list while Yahoo's Marissa Mayer hits the list at 15 . She is joined by Yahoo chief Marissa Mayer in the top twenty at 15 along with Susan Wojcicki, who replaced YouTube chief, Salar Kamangar, in February. Comedian Kevin Hart comes in at number 24 on the disrupters list from Vanity Fair . In a top 50 full of the chiefs of the new establishment such as Spotify, Vice, Snapchat, GoPro and WhatsApp, there is room for only one African American, the comedian, Kevin Hart. While the Vanity Fair 'Disrupters' list reflects poorly on diversity of those hoping to break into the culutral movers and shakers, it is not necessarily reflected in its more robust 'Powers that Be' roll call. While Murdoch and Bloomberg sit at number one and four respectively, music giants Beyoncé and her husband Jay Z both come in at joint number five - boosted by $100 worth of ticket sales for their recent joint tour, but chastened by rumors surrounding the health of their marriage. Last year, the power-couple topped the list, but ugly surveillance footage of Beyoncé's sister Solange attacking Jay Z inside a Manhattan elevator earlier this summer has taken the shine off their glossy united front. Former number 1's: Beyoncé and her husband Jay Z appear at number five on the list of 'The Powers that Be' - but last year they were at the top of that list . Entertainment and media moguls: Michael Bloomberg drops from two to four on the list of powers that be, while embattled NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell makes an appearance at number eight this year . Embattled NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell also makes the powerful list, coming in at number eight, although it remains to be seen whether he will be there next year as the league's handling of the Ray Rice affair is rapidly spiraling out of his control. The top ten also includes potential 2016 presidential hopeful Hilary Clinton, who comes in at number nine after not featuring the previous year at all. She will surely only rise up Vanity Fair's list if, as expected, she confirms she will be running for president - a decision she has promised to make before January 1, 2015. Late night hosts: Jimmy Kimmel, Jimmy Fallon and Stephen Colbert made number 15 on the list of movers and shakers on the 25 'Powers that Be' New entry: Hilary Clinton is ranked number nine on the list of 'The Powers that Be' alongside Robert Downey JR. at six - and will surely rise during the year . The other women in the top 25 'Powers that Be' are Sandra Bullock, at 14 and BIg Bang Theory show runner, Shonda Rhimes at 18. At joint number 15 are the future late night triumvirate of Stephen Colbert. Jimmy Fallon and Jimmy Kimmel. When Colbert was announced as the replacement for CBS's long-serving David Letterman on the Late Show, many bemoaned the lack of diversity on the nation's television sets at that prestigious time-slot. Fresh from the $3 billion sale of his Beats music subscription and headphone company, Dr. Dre is the first and highest African American on the list at number 12, joined in the top 25 by Pharrel Williams at 22 and Tyler Perry at 20.

"Shahab Reza, who is deaf, has admitted defrauding the Department of Work and Pensions out of thousands of pounds by falsely claiming benefits for sign language interpreters . A deaf man and his family falsely claimed £800,000 for sign language interpreters in a 'dishonest and greedy' benefits scam, a court has heard. Shahab Reza, of Perivale, west London,  submitted fake invoices to the Department of Work and Pensions (DWP) but used the money to fund holidays, jewellery and university fees, prosecutors say. The 51-year-old and his wife, Shehnaz Reza, both of whom are deaf, also involved their children, Zainab Reza, 22, and Abbas Reza, 26, it is claimed. Father Shahab, 51, has admitted his role in the swindle and is facing years behind bars. Mother Shehnaz and children Zainab and Abbas all deny being part of a conspiracy. Southwark Crown Court heard Shahab masterminded a four-year scam by submitting fake invoices for sign language interpreters to the DWP through the Access to Work scheme. Prosecutor Rosina Cottage QC said: 'This case concerns dishonesty and greed that started with Shabab Reza, who has acknowledged his dishonesty by pleading guilty to every count that he faced on the indictment. 'He was assisted by his wife, Shehnaz Reza and his children, Abbas and Zainab Reza, to obtain taxpayers' money through sophisticated frauds at the heart of the benefits system. 'Shahab Reza is deaf and so is his wife. They... pretended that they required the assistance of British Sign Language interpreters and Support Workers dishonestly, to obtain grants from the Access to Work Scheme, operated by the Department for Work and Pensions. 'Approximately £800,000 was paid into bank accounts controlled by members of the Reza family. It was spent on property and jewellery, holidays and investments.' She added: 'Many thousands of pounds were obtained through this simple, but clever fraud. 'Housing benefit was paying for the family home and the children's day-to-day expenses were met by grants and bursaries. There was money to spend. 'In order to be able to spend the money it needed to appear to come from legitimate business income. 'The Reza family set about laundering the money through accounts in Canada, the United Arab Emirates and the UK.' The family spent the money on property in Dubai, a new luxury family home and £600,000 penthouse apartment, the court heard. Shehnaz Reza (pictured, left) and her children, Zainab (centre) and Abbas (right), deny conspiracy to defraud . Prosecutors said that when the alleged fraudsters were arrested there was thousands of pounds worth of gold jewellery and gems in a safe at their house, as well as a £8,000 diamond. The court heard Shahab also lied about his family's financial circumstances to Harrow Council, netting nearly £100,000 in benefits and tax exemptions between June 2002 and August 2010. The Reza family is also accused of conning the NHS and the Student Loans Company, with Abbas allegedly receiving a fraudulent bursary. Ms Cottage told the court: 'Shahab and Shehnaz Reza also told lies to the claim Housing and Council Tax benefit to pay for the family home. 'The overpayment of this benefit amounted to some £100,000. Shahab Reza and his children also carried out frauds to top up their student income when Abbas and Zainab were at university and when Abbas was studying medicine. 'These frauds were perpetrated against the Student Loans Company and the NHS Bursary Scheme, both of which exists to assist those with few means. 'The ease with which these frauds were perpetrated is scandalous; the extend of the Reza family's greed and ability to lie is breathtakingly arrogant.' Mother Shehnaz, 53, and her children Abbas and Zainab, each deny conspiracy to defraud. They accept that a scam took place but claim they were 'doing what they were told' and did not realise that the documents they signed were important, the court heard. Southwark Crown Court heard claims the scam was a 'simple but clever' way of swindling thousands . Shehnaz Reza further denies single counts of fraud by false representation, obtaining money transfer by deception and dishonestly obtaining exemption from liability. Zainab denies a further count of fraud by false representation, while Abbas denies two counts of fraud by false representation. Shahab Reza admitted conspiracy to defraud, two counts of obtaining money transfer by deception, two counts of dishonestly obtaining exemption from liability, and three counts of fraud by false representation. Four deaf friends of the family - Saifur Rahman, 31, Ahsan Naseer, 29, Natela Babina, 30, and Daiva Alisauskaite, 42 - are also on trial, accused of being part of a swindle. Naseer, of Birmingham, Babina, of Wembley, north west London, Alisauskaite, of Hackney, east London, and Rahman, of Camden, north London, all deny conspiracy to defraud the Department of Work and Pensions. The trial at Southwark Crown Court in London, which is expected to last two months, continues. Shahab allegedly started the scam after realising it was easy  to get reimbursed for sign language interpreters .

"Workers at an electronics factory in China just wanted to have their carrot cake and eat it - but walked out in protest when they didn't get any.

"The Sydney man who rose to social media fame after mocking people's strange Tinder photos has met up with one of his female subjects for the first time after the photo went viral across the world. Instead of using Tinder to find a potential date, Jarrod Allen, 25, uses it as inspiration to painstakingly recreate weird and wonderful profile photos.

"An Australian carpet layer is accused of murdering a women he met on Tinder who plummeted 14 floors from his apartment after the pair had rough sex during a night of heavy drinking. Gable Tostee was last month charged with the murder of New Zealand tourist Warriena Wright, 26, after she fell from the balcony of his apartment in Gold Coast, Queensland, on August 8. Tostee has denied the charge. A judge on Monday described the charge of murder against Tostee as 'difficult' because the 28-year-old was not on the balcony at the time Ms Wright fell to her death. Gable Tostee was last month charged with the murder of Warriena Wright after she fell from the balcony of his apartment in Gold Coast, Queensland, on August 8. Tostee has denied the charge . New Zealand tourist Warriena Wright met with Tostee after the pair met on mobile dating app Tinder . An alleged account of Ms Wright's final hours by police claims Tostee held Ms Wright in a 78-second long stranglehold and may have made her drink 'vodka' brewed from a homemade still inside his Surfers Paradise apartment before her death. A transcript of an audio recording found on Tostee's phone has been submitted by Queensland Police in documents to Brisbane Supreme Court in opposition to a bail application by Tostee. The transcript of the three hour and 19-minute recording, which covers an eight hour period, allegedly documents Ms Wright's tryst with Tostee, heavy drinking, a violent argument and her fatal fall. The recording spans an eight hour period of time from when Tostee met Ms Wright up until the early hours of the morning as he was sat with his father in a parked car awaiting legal assistance . The documents claim Ms Wright used her online name Cletus to set up a date with Tostee on the mobile dating app in Surfers Paradise on August 7. It is alleged the pair were captured on CCTV at 8.45pm meeting outside a surf shop before going to a shop to buy beer. They then allegedly go to Tostee's apartment where they socialise and drink. Gable Tostee was an active Tinder dater in the months leading up to his meeting Warriena Wright on August 7 . It is alleged the pair were captured on CCTV at 8.45pm meeting outside a surf shop before going to a shop to buy beer. They then allegedly go to Tostee's apartment where they socialise and drink . Documents submitted to the court claim the recording found on Tostee's phone started just before 1am, and 20 seconds into the recording a male voice says 'F*** me', the Brisbane Times has reported. Sounds of groaning can be heard, then the male tells the woman she is being too rough during sex, and says 'I don't like being beaten up'. According to documents submitted by police to the court, the sounds of a struggle begin at about 2.10am after the sound of drinks being poured had been heard a few minutes earlier. Over the next few minutes the argument gets worse and at 2.13am the sounds of a struggle are interspersed with his swearing and her saying 'OK, it is all good' while she sounds out of breath. During the 10 minutes leading up to 2.21am he calls her a 'god damn psycho' twice and there are further sounds of the struggle. In an outline of submissions for the Crown case, the alleged facts say that at 2.17am, after he tells her 'get up, get up' and she says, 'I am so sorry', 'there are sounds consistent with the deceased being held down and her airway restricted. Her breath is clearly laboured. [Tostee] continues to talk ... saying repeatedly 'you don't understand'. The transcript of the three hour and 19-minute recording, which covers an eight hour period, allegedly documents Ms Wright's tryst with Tostee, heavy drinking, a violent argument and her fatal fall . 'There are sounds of slapping and [Tostee] saying ""let go, let go"". The sounds of restricted breathing coninue for 78 seconds and only stops when there is the sounds of something dropping and then [Tostee] complains about her trying to hit him. 'At this stage the deceased's airway is no longer restricted and she starts yelling out ""no"" repeatedly. 'This escalates in crescendo and anxiety and there are sounds of the balcony door being opened, and scuffling consistent with [Tostee] dragging the deceased towards the balcony.' The Crown continues: 'This part of the struggle' takes just under one minute, commencing 'at 2.19.48am and continues until 2.20.46am, at which point the door can be heard slamming shut leaving the deceased on the balcony and [Tostee] inside the unit. 'The last thing said before the deceased is outside the balcony is her screams intensifying as she screams ""just let me go home"". '[Tostee] says in a very aggressive tone, ""I would but you have been a bad girl"". 'Her voice becomes more muffled and it is apparent she is on the other side of the door. 'At 2.21.12am, one hour, 24 minutes and 25 seconds into the recording, a scream can be heard that fades, consistent with the deceased falling.' Police have claimed Tostee taunted Ms Wright in his flat when she threatened to call the police after discovering her iPhone was missing . At 2.23am, according to the court transcript, Tostee says 'F***, f***, f***' before getting dressed and letting himself out of his apartment and then through the basement of the Avalon Apartments and onto the street. Between 2.31am and 3am, he appears to be walking on the road, with the sound of traffic, other people and finally, at 3.08am, a night club. He arrives at Domino's Pizza at around 3.10am and can be heard eating his slice of Supreme at 3.11am. He continues walking until 3.22.56am, when he rings his father, Burleigh carpet salesman, Gray Tostee. Court documents claim Ms Wright used her online name Cletus to set up a date with Tostee on the mobile dating app Tinder on August 7 . Gable tells his father, 'There a million cops around my building, I'm f****d'. and for the next 20 minutes they discuss what has happened as Mr Tostee negotiates where to pick up his son, who appears seriously panicked about being spotted by police. Tostee tells his father he is at Domino's and then cites other locations in Cavill Mall, including Melba's, the Mantra buildings, and describes what he is wearing. Gray Tostee appears to pick up Gable in the driveway at the Circle on Cavill, a shopping area at the base of two landmark Gold Coast towers in Surfers Paradise, the Mantra buildings. The conversation continues in the car, in which Gable tells his father what has happened: . 'I tackled her down inside on the ground inside the apartment ... God I hope that she is not dead.' Gable Tostee expresses his anxiety about contacting their lawyer and about his father stopping the car at a service station or shopping centre, saying 'just go to a house, there are cameras at servos' and 'just like park next to some bushes ... park on the street next to a fence that way no one will see'. At 4.04am he says, 'if anything is wrong it would show up on the news wouldn't it?'. At 4.15am, Gray Tostee parks the car. Seven hours later, Gable Tostee accompanied his lawyer, Michael Purcell, to Surfers Paradise Police Station and declined to make a statement. According to the court documents, forensic police are still analysing the illegal still which is believed to be the source of the home-made vodka referred to in the recording. Mr Tostee continually refers to drinking and his special 'vodka' and the couple discuss sex, body parts and alternative religions and beliefs before the alcohol-fuelled row, according to the court documents. In the court documents, the Crown notes 'deceased's voice sounds progressively more slurred' during the evening following the drinking of what may be the 'home made vodka'. Police have opposed the bail application for Tostee, saying he contacted more than 250 girls on Tinder in the months before he allegedly murdered Ms Wright . A judge on Monday described the charge of murder against Tostee as 'difficult' because the 28-year-old was not on the balcony at the time Ms Wright fell to her death. Considering Tostee's bail application in the Brisbane Supreme Court, Judge Debra Mullins asked Crown Prosecutor Sarah Farnden, 'The prosecution case is that the applicant wasn't on the balcony that Ms Wright fell from?'. 'That appears to be the most likely scenario,' Ms Farnden said. Tostee has been in custody since mid-August when he was arrested and charged with murder. 'If your client was not on the balcony, it makes the murder case a lot more difficult,' Justice Mullins told the accused's barrister, Anthony Kimmins. 'But in the context of what happened in the apartment, I would think a manslaughter case is not weak.' It is alleged the pair were captured on CCTV at 8.45pm meeting outside a surf shop before going to a shop to buy beer. They then allegedly go to Tostee's apartment where they socialise and drink . Justice Mullins postponed the bail application, requesting more information after she read sworn statements by police, Tostee and Tostee's parents about his autism diagnosis. She said his previous diagnosis of being on the autism spectrum was referenced in the Crown's material, but was not addressed in defence documents. She said a diagnosis of autism on Tostee could have a bearing on how the court viewed what allegedly happened inside his apartment on the night of August 8, when Ms Wright fell 14 storeys to the pavement below. Police have opposed the bail application for Tostee, saying he contacted more than 250 girls on Tinder in the months before he allegedly murdered Ms Wright. A document filed in the bail application says: 'Police hold a strong belief that if Tostee is granted bail, he will recommence his using social media. 'Police believe Tostee's blatant disregard for human life and his propensity of violence displayed in this instance would place the safety of the community at an unacceptable risk.'

"Multiple people are claiming that Ray Rice told NFL commissioner Roger Goodell that he punched his then fiancée in a meeting back in June. Four sources close to Rice say that during a disciplinary meeting in the commissioner's office on June 16, Rice told Goodell he had hit Janay Rice, his now-wife, in the face inside a Revel Casino Hotel elevator in Atlantic City, New Jersey, and knocked her unconscious. This contradicts a statement made by Goodell that Rice was 'ambiguous' about what happened when the two spoke earlier this year. Scroll down for video . Who's telling the truth?: Multiple sources claim Ray Rice told NFL commissioner Roger Goodell that he punched his then fiancée in a meeting back in June . Not forthright: Goodell has claimed that rice (above, with wife Janay) was 'ambiguous' about what happened . The news comes hot on the heels of conflicting reports about when Goodell first saw video of the incident. Goodell claims he did not see it until earlier this week, while a law enforcement official has possibly contradicted that statement by playing  a 12-second voicemail from an NFL office number on April 9 confirming the video had arrived for them to view. A female voice expresses thanks and says: 'You're right. It's terrible.' The message was played for the Associated Press on Wenesday. 'Ray didn't lie to the commissioner,' a source with knowledge of the meeting told Outside the Lines. 'He told the full truth to Goodell -- he made it clear he had hit her, and he told Goodell he was sorry and that it wouldn't happen again.' Added another source, who echoed that Rice was honest with the commissioner, 'This is a public lynching of Ray.' 'There was no ambiguity about what happened [in the elevator],' said a third source. A fourth source also confirmed all these statements. Sacked: Rice was terminated by the Baltimore Ravens on Monday, and has been suspended indefinitely by the NFL . Investigating: Goodell announced former FBI director Robert S Mueller III will conduct a probe into how the league pursued and handled evidence . Goodell has yet to respond to this current accusation. On Wednesday, he announced former FBI director Robert S Mueller III will conduct a probe into how the league pursued and handled evidence as it investigated claims against Rice. There is also one other person with knowledge of the meeting who backs up Goodell's claim, and says that Rice implied that he only 'slapped' Janay. NFL spokesman Greg Aiello declined to comment Thursday afternoon. Rice, whose contract with the Baltimore Ravens was terminated on Monday, remains indefinitely suspended from the NFL. He is expected to challenge that decision this Monday.","Multiple people have come forward to say Ray Rice was honest  with NFL commissioner Roger Goodell in June, saying he punched his fiancée .

"Paris’ top cop got more than he bargained for when he recently visited a tourist hot spot to see the French capital’s notorious ‘bracelet scammers’ at work. Police Commissioner Bernard Boucault and Jacques Meric, the city’s head of public safety, were physically attacked by the crooks when they made the official visit to the neighbourhood of Montmartre last Saturday. The pair wanted to observe the aggressive scammers after receiving a constant stream of complaints from tourists and locals, but they became victims themselves. Scroll down for video . Police keep an eye on tourists at the Sacre-Coeur basilica in Paris' Montmartre neighbourhood . Mr Boucault, Mr Meric and their chauffeur confronted a group of ‘tresseurs’ or braiders after they exited their vehicle at Louise-Michel Square, according to French magazine Le Point and The Local. The attack occurred as they attempted to stop the street hustlers, who were targeting tourists. The police commissioner was slapped, his chauffeur was punched and Mr Meric was kicked. There was no word on whether any of the assailants were caught or charged, The Local reported. Paris' police commissioner was attacked in Montmartre while trying to stop scammers from targeting tourists . In the so-called ‘bracelet scam’, crooks tie string to a tourist’s finger or wrist and weave it into a friendship bracelet, and then order the tourist to hand over money in return. Threats often follow if a tourist refuses to buy the bracelet. Montmartre is notorious for street hustlers who intimidate visitors with a variety of gimmicks. Other scams include a three-card sleight of hand trick that encourages the victim to place a bet on the location of a pea or a disc under a cup.","Bernard Boucault visited Montmartre to see the crooks at work .

"A father-to-be has been signed off work claiming he is suffering from morning sickness. Harry Ashby, 29, who is expecting a baby with fiancée Charlotte Allsopp, 19, says he has been diagnosed with Couvade syndrome - or sympathetic pregnancy - after going to his GP complaining of weight gain, exhaustion and food cravings. The security guard, from Erdington, Birmingham, believes he is the first man in Britain to be signed off sick with the unusual condition, which many doctors do not recognise. Syndrome: Harry Ashby, 29, whose fiancée Charlotte Allsopp, 19, is pregnant, has begun developing breasts . Mr Ashby, 29, is expecting a baby girl with  Charlotte Allsopp, 19, from Erdington, Birmingham . He began being sick in the mornings and noticed his breasts and stomach were growing . He said his problems began two months ago when he and Miss Allsopp, his partner of three years, discovered she was pregnant. Mr Ashby, who has auditioned for both Britain's Got Talent and X Factor, said he started suffering from morning sickness and noticed his breasts and stomach were growing. Like his fiancée, he felt exhausted all the time, and suffered back and chest pains. Miss Allsopp, a hairdresser, said: 'He started throwing up in the mornings and we'd lie on the sofa and moan at the same time about our aches and pains.' She said the father of her baby girl, which is due early next year, shares her cravings for fatty foods such as Chinese takeaways, as well as orange Lucozade. He also began craving salt and vinegar crisps, which he normally dislikes, just like her. But Mr Ashby, a part-time model who prides himself on his physique, began to panic when he discovered he'd put on a stone and a half. The couple researched Mr Ashby's symptoms on the internet before he went to see his GP, who diagnosed him with the little-known Couvade syndrome, or sympathetic pregnancy. His GP diagnosed him with little-known Couvade - or sympathy - syndrome and may be the first man in Britain to get a sick note for it . Miss Allsopp, a hairdresser, says she does 'get a bit tired' looking after him, especially when she has her own aches and pains to deal with . The Duchess of Cambridge is suffering from hyperemesis gravidarum, a severe form of morning sickness . The name Couvade syndrome (also known as male sympathetic pregnancy) comes from the French 'couver', which means 'to hatch'. It is not a medically recognised condition, although a 2007 study showed that 11 out of 282 expectant fathers surveyed had gone to their GP with symptoms similar to those of their pregnant partners. Symptoms may include nausea, vomiting, weight gain, food cravings, tiredness, depression, fainting and toothache. In more extreme cases, men may develop breasts and a pregnant-looking stomach. Some sufferers said their symptoms subsided as the pregnancy went on, while others said lasted up to and during the labour. Mr Ashby, who said his doctor told him he was the first man in Britain to be given a sick note for the condition, went to his security firm boss who let him take time off work in light of the diagnosis. He told the Sun he felt better knowing what was wrong with him, and appreciated the insight into what his fiancée was going through. Mr Ashby said he also had a new understanding of what the Duchess of Cambridge, who is suffering from a severe form of morning sickness known as hyperemesis gravidarum, was going through. And he said he hoped speaking out about the condition might help others suffering a similar problem. His partner, however, is not entirely sympathetic. 'I do get a bit tired of having to look after Harry when he should be looking after me,' she said. The talent show hopeful and his fiancée previously lost a baby during pregnancy, and they believe the trauma of this led to their unusual closeness, which they say their friends find fascinating. Miss Allsopp's baby is now due on 2 January, and she is not the only one to feel anxious about giving birth. Mr Ashby said: 'I'm a bit nervous, as some men who have Couvade syndrome also had bad labour pains when their partners give birth.'","Harry Ashby, 29, is expecting a baby girl with fiancée Charlotte Allsopp, 19 .

"At the height of this summer's travel season, airline flights were more likely to arrive on time and less likely to be canceled than they were last year. The improvement in airline performance in July was a welcome break for travelers. Over the first six months of 2014, delays were the highest since 2008 and cancelations the highest since 2000. The U.S. Department of Transportation said Wednesday that among 14 of the largest airlines, 75.6 percent of flights arrived on time in July, up from 73.1 percent in July 2013 and from June 2014's 71.8 percent rate. Ready when you are: The world's biggest airline was also the most punctual during the summer months . The airlines covered by the report canceled 1.6 percent of their trips, down from 1.7 percent a year earlier and 2 percent in June. The best for arriving on time were Hawaiian, Delta and Alaska, all above 84 percent. At the bottom of the rankings: JetBlue Airways and Southwest Airlines, with nearly one in three flights arriving late. JetBlue spokesman Morgan Johnston said the airline was making better use of spare planes and adjusting staffing in its operations center to handle delays during summer thunderstorms. He said the airline's August numbers, not yet released by the government, were better. Southwest had a pattern of consistently late arrivals on many routes. According to the government, Southwest ran late more than half the time in May, June and July on three short daily flights — a 6 p.m. Houston-Dallas trip, a 7:45 p.m. flight from Los Angeles to San Francisco, and a 9 p.m. Las Vegas-Phoenix flight. Delayed: Southwest had 108 flights that ran late for two months straight. They were the worst out of all U.S. airlines when it came to punctuality . Rankings: The best for arriving on time were Hawaiian, Delta and Alaska, all above 84 percent. At the bottom of the rankings: JetBlue Airways and Southwest Airlines, with nearly one in three flights arriving late . No other airline had any flights that were tardy so often for so long. Another 108 Southwest flights regularly ran late for two straight months. No other airline had more than six such chronically delayed flights. Southwest has struggled to fly on time since tightening its schedule in August 2013. Senior vice president of operations Greg Wells said that the airline thought it could boost revenue by adding 16 planes' worth of new flights without increasing the fleet. 'We gave it our best shot,' Wells told reporters this week. 'The combination of weather, higher load factors (fuller planes) and things like that just caused our on-time performance to plummet.' Wells said the airline 'stopped the bleeding' by focusing on starting morning flights on time, putting more time between connecting flights, and allowing more time to unload and load planes. Since Aug. 24, he said, the airline has been running at 84 percent on-time. The Department of Transportation said that two flights in July — one by Spirit Airlines and another by US Airways — were stuck on the tarmac longer than the allowed three hours. The airlines could face fines. There were 10 reports of pets that were lost, injured or died during flights, down from 11 in June. That only covers pets that were accompanied by their owners. Beginning January 1, the Department of Transportation will require airlines to report deaths of cats and dogs that are shipped by breeders too.","In July, among 14 of the largest airlines, 75.6% of flights arrived on time .

"Victor Carles Quiros, 24, died of 'multiple injuries' after being hit by a Tube train when he wandered on to the tracks while drunk . A City lawyer who was killed after walking out in front of a Tube train had drunk enough 'to cause a coma' on the night he died, an inquest has been told. Victor Carles Quiros, 24, consumed four bottles of wine and half a bottle of whisky along with his cousin, Orlando Vasquesz, and two friends at a gathering in Kensington, West London. An inquest at Westminster Coroner's Court was told Mr Quiros went outside to get a phone signal, leaving his wallet, keys and coat in the flat. He was next seen stumbling around Ladbroke Grove tube station after 5am. He walked through a gate on to the tracks and began walking towards Latimer Road, one stop away, the inquest heard. He was hit by a Hammersmith and City line train travelling at around 40mph and died of 'multiple injuries' on April 12, the hearing was told. Mr Quiros had a blood alcohol content of between 200mg and 300mg of alcohol per 100ml of blood, more than three times the legal drink drive limit, and a level where 'coma may occur'. A statement from Jason Archer, the train driver who last saw Mr Quiros alive, said: 'I was driving a Westbound Hammersmith and City train. 'As I emerged from this bend I was travelling at about 40mph when to my horror I saw a male person ahead of me. “He never looked behind him, made no attempt to out of my way. I don’t know if he was aware of me. I was upon him in the blink of an eye. I heard a bang as I hit him.' A prepared statement from Mr Vasquesz said: 'At around 4.30am he left my flat. When he left I didn’t pay attention to what he was doing. 'The fact is that when he left my flat he didn’t take with him his wallet, his keys and his coat...maybe he was disorientated and drunk. 'I am 100 per cent certain that Victor didn’t take his life on purpose. I knew him very well. We were cousins, family, like brothers.' Steven Tucker, of British Transport Police, added: 'At 5.25am he can be just seen disappearing into the gloom towards Latimer Road. He looks unsteady. He looks drunk on CCTV.' Mr Quiros drank four bottles of wine and half a bottle of whisky with his cousin, Orlando Vasquesz, and two friends. The inquest was told his blood alcohol content was high enough to cause a coma . Mr Quiros disappeared from his cousin's house at around 4.30am on April 12, and was next seen at Ladbroke Grove Tube station where he walked through a gate and on to the tracks . Coroner Doctor William Dolman said: 'My conclusion, one word now, would be accident. 'We have a 24-year-old lawyer from Panama who goes to his cousin’s for a sociable evening with friends, four people there. 'And, as Orlando Vasquesz has explained, they each drank a bottle of wine, and half a bottle of whisky between them. 'It was a convivial evening. There was nothing amiss with him. And Orlando suggests that he left the flat for the lack of mobile signal. He’s expected back there that night. 'No-one can answer for him, what he was doing on the line at that time. We can only assume that he would have been very drunk.' In a statement the international firm of lawyers where Mr Quiros worked said: 'All of us at Arias, Fabrega and Fabrega regret to announce with deep grief the unexpected death of our colleague. 'Victor Carles, resident attorney from our London office, unexpectedly passed away on April 12th. We remember our friend and associate with gratitude and great affection. 'To his family, friends and co-workers, we wish to express our condolences, love and everlasting admiration for a professional and outstanding extraordinary human being.

"A pair of bear cubs have been left orphaned following the capture of their mother by Italian authorities after she attacked a mushroom picker. Officials in Trento captured the brown bear, called Daniza, on Wednesday and she was tranquilised with an anaesthetic. However, the mother failed to wake up and now animal rights groups are calling for the resignation of the Italian environment minister after the forestry police opened an investigation into the capture operation due to the death of the animal. Scroll down for video . Daniza, the brown bear, pictured with her two eight-month-old cubs, before she was captured and died after being tranquilised . Authorities authorised the captured of Daniza after a mushroom scavenger in Trento, reported that she attacked him last month . Daniza's story has captivated Italians ever since a mushroom scavenger reported that she attacked him last month in northern Trento province. Daniele Maturi, who was foraging in the woods near Pinzolo survived the attack but suffered bites as well as scratches to his wrist, legs, knee and back. A team of specialists was then sent to search for their bear, who was reintroduced to the Italian countryside as part of an EU-funded operation after they were almost wiped out decades ago. But animal rights activists say the bear should have been left alone as she was merely trying to protect her eight-month-old cubs. On Wednesday it was ordered for the bear to be captured but after being tranquilised, she failed to wake up. The last picture to be taken of Daniza, using an infra-red camera, shows her with one of her young cubs. Activists say she should have been left alone and not pursued . Italy's national forestry police opened an investigation and speculated that criminal charges could result for the mistreatment and death of an animal. The forestry police had actively protested Daniza's capture on the grounds that her cubs weren't yet old enough to care for themselves. The National Animal Protection Agency, a non-governmental organisation, called for Environment Minister Gian Luca Galletti to resign, alleging he didn't do enough to protect Daniza. Daniza, pictured, was introduced to the Italian countryside in 2000 following a bear re-introduction programme called Live Ursus . The EU-funded programme went ahead after the bear population decreased in Italy and nine bears from Slovenia were flew into the country . But Mr Galletti said he had asked Trento officials for a report on what went wrong and said the priority must now be to care for Daniza's cubs. The bear re-introduction project, called Live Ursus, began in 1999 with the introduction of nine brown bears from Slovenia. Animal rights activists have praised the project, but residents say the programme has been too successful and that too many bears are now roaming a densely populated area, killing livestock and increasingly running into humans.","Officials in Trento captured the bear, called Daniza, in Trento, northern Italy .

"A powerful solar flare blasting its way towards Earth could wreak havoc with communications  and power systems in the coming days. Scientists have warned that the 'extreme' solar storm could affect power grids, satellites and radio transmissions when the flare arrives at the Earth's surface. But they said they are not 'scared of this one', as the worst of its power looks like it will barely skim above the planet and not cause many problems. Scroll down for video . Scientists have warned that the 'extreme' solar storm could affect power grids, satellites and radio transmissions when the flare arrives at the Earth's surface . The storm is moving medium-fast - about 2.5 million miles per hour - meaning the soonest it could arrive is early Friday. Tom Berger, director of the Space Weather Prediction Center in Boulder, Colorado, said it has been several years since Earth has had a solar storm of this size coming from sunspots smack in the middle of the sun . The flare on the sun barely hits the 'extreme' on forecasters' scales, and with its worst effects missing Earth it is only looking 'potentially strong' at most when it arrives at Earth as a solar storm. 'There's been a giant magnetic explosion on the sun,' Berger explained. 'Because it's pointed right at us, we'll at least catch some of the cloud.' Solar flares are violent explosions on the sun with an energy equivalent to tens of millions of hydrogen bombs . Sun flares expand the photogenic Aurora Borealis, or Northern Lights, across Canada and the northern U.S. Most flares occur around sunspots, where intense magnetic fields emerge from the Sun's surface . The cloud contains highly energized and magnetized plasma that can disrupt the Earth's magnetic sphere, and has been known to cause temporary power grid problems. New calculations from satellite data show that the worst of the energetic particles streaming from the sun are likely go north or above Earth this time, Berger said yesterday. A solar flare is a violent explosion on the sun with an energy equivalent to tens of millions of hydrogen bombs. It occurs when energy stored in 'twisted' magnetic fields is suddenly released. This produces a burst of radiation across the electromagnetic spectrum. Most flares occur around sunspots, where intense magnetic fields emerge from the sun's surface into the corona. They can be dangerous to humans, but the Earth's atmosphere absorbs most of the high-energy rays. So while the power grid may see fluctuations because the storm will cause changes in Earth's magnetic field, it won't knock power systems off line. It may cause slight disturbances in satellites and radio transmissions but nothing major. 'We're not scared of this one,' Berger added. Solar storms occur often, especially during peaks in the solar cycle, and don't directly harm people. Forecasters with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Space Weather Prediction Center yesterday said the flare already 'caused impacts to high-frequency radio communications on Earth today'. 'A coronal mass ejection (CME) associated with this event is likely, but further analysis is necessary to determine whether it will produce geomagnetic storming on Earth,' it added. A CME contains billions of tons of energetic hydrogen and helium ions as well as protons and electrons ejected from the sun's surface. On the plus side, sun flares expand the photogenic Aurora Borealis, or Northern Lights, so more people in Canada and the northern U.S. will be able to enjoy nature's light show over the coming days. The Northern Lights usually appear in the night sky in polar latitudes as shimmering green waves of light. The spectacle occurs when atoms in the Earth's high-altitude atmosphere collide with energetic charged particles from the sun.","Scientists warn 'extreme' solar storm could affect power grids and satellites .

"Fiji authorities have confirmed that its 45 United Nations peacekeepers, who are being held captive by terrorists in Syria, appear in a recent YouTube video. The footage, which was posted on Wednesday, shows two men speaking Arabic while Fijian troops sit cross-legged behind them. One Fijian soldier, who speaks in English, said September 9 marked a 'very happy day'. 'We've been informed that we will be released soon, and we are all very happy to be going home,' he said. Scroll down for video . It's been confirmed the 45 Fijian soldiers are 'safe and alive' whilst being held by Nusra Front terrorists . A Fijian U.N. peacekeeper, among the 45 held captive in Syria, has been identified as Captain Savenaca Rabuka . Most of the 15-minute video is films the two men speaking Arabic but near the end, a Fijian soldier says the troops have been treated well by the Nusra Front. 'We're all safe and alive,' he said. 'I would like to assure you that we have not been harmed in any way. 'I deeply understand with the limited resources that they have [the Nusra Front], they have provided the best for us and we really appreciate it.' Fijian government spokeswoman Sharon Smith-Johns said the soldiers shown in the video are those being held by the Nusra Front. She identified the soldier who speaks as Captain Savenaca Rabuka. At the beginning of the video, the men speaking in Arabic say that God had helped the Nusra Front soldiers and other fighters 'liberate' the Quneitra border crossing which marks the area between Syrian-controlled territory and the Israeli part of the Golan Heights. The video surfaced a day after Fiji may have jumped the gun by announcing that the peacekeepers would soon be released. Two men speak Arabic for the majority of a recently released 15 minute YouTube video . At a Wednesday morning news conference in Suva, Fiji's military chief said they had been told by U.N. headquarters in New York that the Nusra Front had agreed to release the men later this week without any conditions or demands. The South Pacific nation later tried to retract the comments, but by then they had been reported around the world. It is unlikely Fiji would have been given the green light to release any specific information by the U.N., which typically doesn't comment on sensitive captive situations until they are resolved. The Nusra Front had earlier listed three demands for releasing the Fijian peacekeepers it took captive August 28. The group had demanded to be taken off the U.N. terrorist list, wanted humanitarian aid delivered to parts of the Syrian capital Damascus, and wanted compensation for three of its fighters it says were killed in a shootout with U.N. officers.","A Fijian soldier says they were told on Tuesday that they will be released soon .

"Excavator operator Juha-Pekka Peramaki sure has a soft touch. A new video that has gone viral shows Mr Peramaki operating the claws of a Hitachi ZX210, a machine designed to move heavy construction materials and dig up terrain, to snap together Lego blocks. In an absolutely mind-blowing feat, the man uses his 23-tonne excavator to pick up the tiny pieces without crushing them and carefully lower them into place. Finnish excavator operator Juha-Pekka Peramaki uses the machine to put together a tiny Lego toy . With incredible precision and control, Peramaki is able to snap the toys together without crushing the plastic . So how is he able to pull off such a precise task? Much of his control can be attributed to his expert use of the machine's Engcon tiltrotator, which sits between the excavator's massive arm and the grabber. The tiltrotator allows Peramaki to angle the claws up to 45 degrees and rotate them a full 360 degrees. At the end of the video, the camera zooms out to show Peramaki's vantage point, where one can barely make out the surface, let alone the details on the tiny toys.

"A primary school teacher awaiting sentencing for beating up his former girlfriend is receiving taxpayer-funded sick pay, it emerged yesterday. Matthew Shadbolt, 32, has pleaded guilty to assaulting mother-of-three Carly White at her home and is to be sentenced next month. It was after their relationship had lasted two years that the attack took place, leaving the university student with severe bruises to her arms and legs. Awaiting sentence: Primary school teacher Matthew Shadbolt (right) who beat up his former girlfriend Carly White (left) in an attack at her home is still receiving taxpayer-funded sick pay, despite admitting assault . Yesterday she spoke out to alert parents of schoolchildren to his conviction for violence and the possibility of Shadbolt going back to teach at Rise Park Primary School in Nottingham. A spokesman for the school said it was inappropriate to comment but confirmed that Shadbolt remained on long-term sick leave. Miss White, 31, from Giltbrook, Nottinghamshire, said: ‘It is a bit strange how he is still on sick pay.’ Injuries: The university student was left with severe bruises to her arms and legs and today spoke out as a warning to other parents . Employment: Despite admitting the offence, Shadbolot is still receiving full, long-term sick pay . Argument: Miss White said the attack happened after the pair argued before a trip to visit a friend . She explained that she felt compelled to speak out. ‘I wouldn’t be able to live with myself if something happened to a child,’ she said. ‘I thought about it and decided I wanted to make sure this didn’t happen to anyone else. ‘I just feel, if I was a parent at that school, I would want to know about the conviction, to make an informed decision as to whether I felt this person is suitable to teach my children or not. ‘I am hoping to go into teaching myself so it is all close to my heart really,’ she added. Miss White, who had met Shadbolt on dating website Plenty of Fish, said the attack happened as they argued before they set off from her home to visit a terminally-ill friend in Dorset. She added: ‘My children were staying with their father at the time. We had just been alone in the house. ‘It was a frightening experience which left me shaken and afraid. The whole incident lasted for a few minutes.’ Miss White did not contact the police straight away. Instead a friend she had told about the assault contacted police on her behalf about two weeks later. Shadbolt was subsequently arrested by officers. He appeared before Nottingham Magistrates’ Court where he pleaded guilty to one charge of assault by beating on September 3. He will be sentenced at the same court on October 15. Shadbolt’s solicitor declined to comment.","Teacher Matthew Shadbolt, 32, admitted assaulting Carly White, 31 .

"The parents of a 22-year-old psychology graduate who was found murdered in Chile traveled to the city of Temuco this week to transport their daughter's body back to the United States. Chris Hagan and his grief-stricken wife were photographed Wednesday in Chile on their way to make final arrangements for Erica Faith Hagan, according to Soy Chile. The Kentucky woman was found with three head wounds in the bathtub of her apartment on the campus of Colegio Bautista of Temuco Saturday morning. Tragic beauty: Erica Faith Hagan, 22, a psychology graduate from Kentucky, was found dead Saturday morning in her apartment in Chile . Parents' worst nightmare: Bambi and Chris Hagan are pictured in Chile, where they arrived this week to transport their daughter's body back to the US . She was working as an English teacher at a secondary school in Temuco, located 450 miles south of the capital of Santiago. On Tuesday, local authorities announced that they are investigating three potential suspects in connection to Hagan's slaying. They have not been named. Roberto Garrido, a spokesperson for the Public Ministry of Chile, told the press the investigation into the killing has revealed that Ms Hagan likely knew the killer or killers and opened the door for them because officers found no signs of forced entry in her apartment, reported Soy Chile. Hagan's wounds were said to have been caused by a blunt object. AFP reported there were traces of a fire at the unit. Two separate online fundraisers have been set up to help Erica's parents with her final expenses, including the cost of transporting her remains back to the US. Well-educated: Hagan, 22, graduated from Georgetown College in Kentucky earlier this year . Bright future: Hagan obtained a degree in psychology with a minor in Spanish . A friend of Erica Hagan’s has launched a GoFundMe account hoping to collect $100,000, which would go toward a memorial scholarship to 'help carry on her legacy.’ Erica's older sister, Kimberly, also set up a fundraiser Monday, which has since reached - and surpassed - its goal of collecting $5,000 towards the 22-year-old's funeral expenses. ‘Its [sic] very obvious she was loved by many, she will be greatly missed and never forgotten,’ the bereaved Ms Underhill wrote. Kimberly Underhill also revealed that an FBI agent has been sent to Chile to help with the investigation into her sister’s murder. Miss Hagan graduated from Georgetown College in Kentucky earlier this year with a degree in psychology and a minor in Spanish. In July, she traveled to Chile after accepting a six-month job as a teaching assistant in English. She had visited Chile previously and was scheduled to return home in December.

Erica had been documenting her experiences of living and working abroad in her blog 'Donde en el Mundo?' (Where in the world?) Her last entry went up September 5, just two days before her violent death. In her lengthy post, Hagan discussed some instances of culture shock she had experienced in her encounters with the locals. Along with anecdotes about cultural differences between Chileans and Americans, Hagan gushed about the friendliness of the local people. 'God has blessed me with many people that care how I spend my time and don't want me to be lonely while I'm here,' she wrote. 'Everyday I meet more people that invite me to be social with them and I love it! The hardest part is for me to take them up on it by asking them to keep me company during my free time. 'Ironic I know, but I still have that southern upbringing that taught me that it's rude to invite yourself to places. In due time I guess...' Temuco is one of the country's largest cities and located near the southern boarder. A memorial service will be held this week at Georgetown College.

"Football fans are rallying behind a football player who was resigned to his team after being cut so he could keep his health insurance and pay for his four-year-old daughter's cancer treatments. Defensive tackle Devon Still, 25, was cut from the roster of the Cincinnati Bengals two weeks ago, but the team did bring him on to the practice squad instead, meaning he would still get paid and receive his health insurance.

The support from the Bengals - which included allowing Still to miss last Sunday's game in Baltimore - comes after he was out of six games last season for injuries to his elbow and back. Speaking with Bengals.com, he explained: 'They said if I keep working on my physical... and mentally prepared myself to focus on football then they can move me back up to the roster so I am not all the way out of the loop... Just them sticking by me through this whole time, they understand exactly what I am going through. It is a blessing I am on this organization.'

"A feud over staff lunches at a private boys school has become a lawyers' feast. Staff at one of Adelaide's most prestigious schools, St Peter's College, have always got the luxury of supplied lunches, it's believed for about 150 years, but now the school has removed the longstanding lunch subsidies, without any consultation. It's forced angry staff to launch legal action against the school, who claim they have made the change in a bid to cut costs, which sees them fork out around $340,000 a year. St Peters College, Adelaide. Staff have had their lunch subsidies removed. The school is trying to cut costs . Food Feud : Staff at St Peter's College Adelaide have taken legal action against the school after they removed school lunch subsidies . Both parties have enlisted the help of heavyweight QCs and will appear before the Fair Work Commission in arbitration hearings this month. All teachers and staff have been instructed not to speak to the media but representing them is the Independent Education Union who claim the school has been unwilling to negotiate with staff. 'We've got a situation where ... a long-established entitlement has been removed,' state secretary Glen Seidel told ABC radio. 'It's unfortunate that it's around something as eminently mockable as lunches.' More than 200 staff are affected by the loss of the lunch subsidies which is worth about $3000 annually for each staff member. The Independent Education Union claim the school has been unwilling to negotiate with staff. 'The provision of staff lunches at a cost of $340,000 (per year) when the school needs to operate in a highly competitive education environment was, in the opinion of the School Council, unacceptable,' said a St Peter's spokesperson . 'It had been tradition for staff to take their meals with students in the school dining room,' Mr Seidel said. 'Obviously there's a lot of tension around this whole issue on both sides, It really shouldn't have got to this stage.' In a statement, a college spokeswoman said the staff lunches were an anachronistic benefit rarely available in Australian workplaces. 'The reality for St Peter's College is that it must put its finances on a sustainable footing,' she said.

"PC Alan King allegedly had sex with the woman in his marked police car while on duty . A married policeman had sex with a witness in his patrol car while on duty and smoked cannabis he had seized from a crime scene, a court heard. PC Alan King met Zoe Barham after being called to a stabbing at the bookmakers where she worked in 2011. After collecting a witness statement and mobile number from her, the 48-year-old from Hoo, Kent, allegedly sent her text messages and the pair embarked on an affair. The father-of-two  picked Ms Barham up in his marked police car at least once every two weeks and had sex with her in an alleyway next to her house, Canterbury Crown Court heard. During the affair. he asked her if she 'needed' drugs then offered to drop charges against a suspect in exchange for cannabis he found after being the first officer at the scene of a stabbing, it was alleged. King denies misconduct in office, perverting the course of justice and supplying drugs. The court heard how the pair met in June 2011 when King was called to a reported stabbing at Betfred in Gravesend where Ms Barham, 36, worked. That week he visited the shop frequently and was even warned by a superior about his behaviour, the court heard. After collecting her phone number when she gave a witness statement, he sent a text message to the woman on her birthday and the pair began seeing each other. Over one year, the couple met in King's marked car and had sex in the vehicle in an alleyway next to her home while he was on duty, it was alleged. Rebecca Fairbairn, prosecuting, said: 'Alan King had a duty as a police officer to act beyond reproach, however we say he used a telephone number given as part of a police investigation and used it just because he was attracted to this woman.' 'He had an obligation to respond to emergencies and calls from the public, that’s what he is there to do. 'But we say that instead of doing that he was visiting his girlfriend and having sex, and on occasions doing it in public.' At first Ms Barham was unaware that King was married and had two children, she claims. 'We met in Forge Lane in Gravesend and he took me back to his home. 'I wasn’t aware about his relationship at first but I did suspect after a little while [he was married].' 'He would turn up in his marked police car and if I was at work we would just talk and have a fag. 'He would sometimes take me to my home in Gravesend in his police car. 'On one occasion he took me up an alley where we had sexual intercourse in his police car. That happened on several occasions. 'Mr King picked me up in his police car and took me there and he was in uniform. I went there because I was in a relationship with him. The married father-of-two denies misconduct in office, perverting the course of justice and supplying drugs after being accused of taking cannabis from a crime scene and smoking it with his lover . 'He promised me everything. He promised me a lot. He told me he loved me and I believed him at the time.' The 48-year-old took her along while investigating incidents and allowed her to input information into the vehicle's police computer, she added. While responding to a report of a man who had been stabbed in the neck, King allegedly seized cannabis from a suspect after being the first officer at the scene. He then gave the drug to Ms Barham after allegedly agreeing to drop all charges against the suspect, Martin Reid, in exchange for them.

Giving evidence on PC King claimed he was going through marriage difficulties and he was flattered when Ms Barham flirted with him. 'She was very friendly and was flirting with me. 'She made it very clear that she fancied me and its not very often a woman flirted with me...so I felt flattered and I flirted back.' PC King said they began their affair within a week and he admitted taking Ms Barham in his police car while attending non-emergency calls.

"Alex Salmond today insisted that Scotland is 'on the cusp of making history' by voting for independence in next week's referendum. The First Minister claimed that 'Scotland will vote Yes' despite the setbacks which the independence campaign has suffered in the past two days. His speech was met with applause from a gathering of foreign journalists - but the excitement seemed to be too much for actor Brian Cox, a prominent supporter of independence, who was pictured falling asleep during the talk. Scroll down for video . Speech: Alex Salmond today insisted that Scotland was 'on the cusp' of declaring independence . Snooze: Pro-independence actor Brian Cox fell asleep during Mr Salmond's press conference in Edinburgh . Mr Salmond's press conference in Edinburgh came a day after the latest poll showed that 53 per cent of Scots oppose independence, excluding those who have yet to make up their minds. In addition, a number of financial firms announced that they would move their headquarters out of Scotland in the event of a 'Yes' vote next Thursday, while oil giants issued warnings over the future of the North Sea's reserves. 'Scotland is on the cusp of making history,' Mr Salmond said. 'The eyes of the world are upon Scotland. And what the world is seeing is an articulate, peaceful, energised debate. 'Scotland will vote Yes next Thursday and they will vote Yes because last minute, cobbled up promises from the No campaign which unravel at the slightest scrutiny will not fool anyone in this country and neither will the blatant bullying and intimidation of the Westminster Government. 'The No campaign is in terminal decline. In contrast a Yes vote is the opportunity of a lifetime. An opportunity to build a fairer more prosperous country.' Supporter: Mr Cox is a prominent advocate of Scottish nationalism and has campaigned for a 'Yes' vote . Poll: The First Minister claimed he was confident of victory in next Thursday's vote . During the press conference, intended to mark the 17th anniversary of Scotland voting for a devolved Parliament in 1997, Mr Salmond said that the country's people had 're-discovered national self-confidence' during the referendum campaign. 'It has been a process of national empowerment,' he said. 'As a country we have re-discovered national self-confidence. As a nation, we are finding our voice. 'Our message to the people of Scotland is this - for the first time in Scottish history, on the 18th September we, the people, hold our destiny in our own hands. 'We shall not wake up on the 19th of September having given it away. We shall wake up knowing that we did the right thing. Wake up to a lifetime of feeling confident in ourselves and in our country.' During Mr Salmond's speech, Mr Cox, 68, could be seen looking sleepy and nodding off. The actor, who has appeared in films such as Manhunter, Troy and X-Men, is a vocal supporter of Scottish independence, claiming that the legacy of the Labour party is best represented by the 'Yes' campaign. Claim: Mr Salmond said that most world leaders backed Scottish independence because they had not spoken out against it . Exceptions: Barack Obama and Tony Abbott have both openly opposed the break-up of the Union . As well as urging Scots to vote 'Yes', Mr Salmond insisted that he had the support of other world leaders who have not spoken out in favour of the Union. The Foreign Office asked every world leader to back the UK, according to Mr Salmond, but only a few have done so - including US President Barack Obama and Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott. Responding to a question from an Australian journalist, Mr Salmond said: 'I think we've got very substantial support on the international stage. 'Given the UK Government asked every world leader to make a statement of support for their position, and given that only a handful have obliged and done so, I think we have to conclude that other world leaders said ""nein"" or ""no"", or whatever language they were speaking in, to that request from the Foreign Office. 'So I think in these particular circumstances we are entitled to count up all of the world leaders in the great democracies of Europe and elsewhere who obviously declined the Foreign Office Prime Ministerial invitation to say something, and conclude that they therefore did not share that opinion.' He said he had received several hundred letters from Scots-Australians disassociating themselves from Mr Abbott's views, and suggested it could backfire for the Prime Minister at the ballot box.","First Minister says 'Scotland will vote Yes' despite a series of setbacks .
