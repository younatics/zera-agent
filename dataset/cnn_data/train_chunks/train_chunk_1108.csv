"Greg Rutherford has revealed on Twitter how he tried to rescue an injured deer he found while out walking his dogs. The 28-year-old long-jumper, who won a gold medal for Britain at the London 2012 Olympics, discovered the young animal, which he later christened Doris, near his home in Milton Keynes. Rutherford called the RSPCA only to be told that the deer, which had broken its leg, would have to be euthanised because of its injury. Greg Rutherford has revealed on Twitter how he carried an injured deer (right) for two miles to his home . But the Olympian, decided instead to have the animal cared for by staff at the local TiggyWinkles animal hospital. Revealing his attempts to rescue the deer to his 155,000 Twitter followers, he wrote: 'Just carried an injured deer about 2 miles home and now awaiting the RSPCA to come and help the little fella. Poor thing has a broken leg.' He then provided updates, describing how staff at the animal hospital had put its leg in a splint and how they were hopeful it would survive.

He is quoted in The Mirror as saying: 'After explaining what happened I called the RSPCA but they said if they did collect it then they would have to put it down. I didn't want this to happen. 'So I found a local animal sanctuary that's also a 24-hour animal hospital. They came and put the deer's leg in a splint and took it off to recover.' Despite Rutherford's efforts and the care from staff at TiggyWinkles, Doris had to eventually be put down. Despite the best efforts of the long-jumper, Doris eventually had to be put to sleep by hospital staff . The head nurse, Clare Campbell, is quoted in the Mirror as saying Doris was put down because she was suffering from 'horrific' pelvic injuries. 'We are still happy she was rescued because otherwise she would have taken days to die in agony in the wild. At least we were able to give her pain relief and keep her warm and dry,' she said.

"Rio de Janeiro state's top environmental official has acknowledged that the Olympic pledge to clean up their water supply will not be met in time for the 2016 games. They promised to slash the levels of pollution flowing into the raw sewage-filled Guanabara Bay by 80 percent, but this apparently unattainable by next year's summer games. Andre Correa said he couldn't provide an estimate of how much officials would actually succeed in cutting the flow of pollutants into the bay, where the Olympic sailing and wind surfing completions are to be held. Guanabara Bay, which will host Olympic events, will not meet acceptable pollution levels by 2016 . He told reporters at a news conference Friday he wasn't sure whether Olympic officials had yet been warned. Environmentalists have been warning of negligible progress in the cleanup efforts for year. Sailors' associations have also expressed reservations about water quality in the bay and voiced concerns that it could make athletes sick. In December scientists at a Rio de Janeiro research institute found what they call a new 'super-bacteria' that is resistant to antibiotics in the waters where sailors will compete in the Olympic sailing events in 2016 .

"Tottenham will this week consider an £5million swoop for Burnley striker Danny Ings. Mauricio Pochettino wants to add to his forward line before the transfer deadline, and Ings is high on his list of options. Ings has been on Tottenham's radar for over 12 months, with former boss Tim Sherwood interested in the forward during his time in the hotseat. VIDEO Scroll down to see Danny Ings in goal-scoring action for England U21's . Danny Ings has scored seven goals for Burnley this season but he may still ending up leaving the club . Spurs have retained their interest and are set to move for the 22-year-old, who has scored seven goals for the Clarets this season. The White Hart Lane club had been interested in Saido Berahino, but are not prepared to meet West Bromwich's £20million asking price. Pochettino's interest in Southampton forward Jay Rodriguez has cooled owing to the England international's long-running battle to recover from a serious knee injury. A move for Ings may depend on moving players out of the club in the coming days. Pochettino wants to shift a number of players this month as he looks to free up money on his wage bill. Mauricio Pochettino is one of the managers keen on getting Ings' signature, and wants him at Tottenham . They were successful in offloading Kyle Naughton in Swansea last week, recouping £5million. And they remain hopeful in trying to sell more players this month, with Emmanuel Adebayor, Aaron Lennon, Vlad Chiriches, Younes Kaboul and Paulinho all available. Burnley manager Sean Dyche will want to keep his prized-asset until at least the end of the season. But with the striker's contract due to expire in the summer, the club will find it hugely difficult to resist an substantial offer for Ings this month. Because Ings is under 23, Burnley would receive a compensation fee, understood to be in the region of £3million, for the forward should he run down his contract. So any bid upward of that figure is likely to be considered by Burnley.","Mauricio Pochettino would like to bring Danny Ings to Tottenham .

"Fabian Delph has admitted his Aston Villa teammates were shocked when he told them he was signing a new deal at the club. The 25-year-old put pen to paper on a new four-and-a-half deal to end speculation he would leave the club on a free transfer this summer. Liverpool and Tottenham were believed to have been tracking his situation given his previous contract was up at the end of this season.

Delph's performances this season have led to a first England call up from Roy Hodgson . Chief executive Tom Fox said lots of clubs had expressed an interest in Delph, who could have left for a knock-down fee this Janaury. And Delph conceded: ‘The lads are absolutely delighted. As soon as I told some of them they looked at me shocked to start with. ‘They see a lot in me in how I want to go about my career how dedicated I am and how I want to push on. ‘They’re delighted to keep someone like me here. I see them as family, brothers, I’d run through a brick wall for them. They’re not just teammates.’ Villa chief executive Tom Fox (right) admits there were plenty of clubs eager to snatch Delph away . The all action midfielder has lauded his relationship with Villa manager Paul Lambert (centre) Delph also paid tribute to his manager Paul Lambert and said he did not need to talk with Roy Hodgson about how staying at Villa might impact his England chances. ‘I got into the England squad playing for this great club. Hopefully I can keep my spot,’ he said. 'I spoke to my family, I spoke to Tom. I didn’t feel like I needed to speak to Roy about it. It was about not rushing it.’ Delph had been linked with clubs including Liverpool and Tottenham during the January window . On Lambert he added: ‘I’ve had a great relationship with the manager since I’ve been here. I was only training twice a week when he came in. I wasn’t hitting the best potential. He’s got me training every day. ‘I’ll be in his office for 40 minutes speaking to him about how I can improve my game and hurt the opposition more. I’m really confident about the future and what’s going on here.’ Fox added: ‘There were a lot of interested clubs. We’ve got a top young player here.

"Crystal Palace manager Alan Pardew is turning conventional wisdom on its head by focusing on attack to keep the club in the Premier League. Whereas most new managers faced with a relegation fight go back to basics and prioritise defence, Pardew has spent hours on the training pitch with his young maverick strike force of Dwight Gayle, Wilfried Zaha, Yaya Sanogo and Jason Puncheon. The early results have been impressive, with nine goals in Pardew’s three wins as Palace boss. Gayle has four of those, including a match-winning double in their comeback win against Burnley.

Burnley (4-3-3): Heaton 6; Trippier 7, Shackell 5.5, Keane 6, Mee 7; Marney 6, Jones 5.5 (Wallace 90min), Arfield 6.5; Boyd 6.5 (Sordell 90), Barnes 6 (Vokes 73, 6), Ings 7. Subs not used: Gilks, Duff, Reid, Kightly. Booked: Shackell. Scorers: Mee 12, Ings 16. Crystal Palace (4-3-3): Speroni 5.5; Ward 6, Dann 5.5, Delaney 6, Kelly 6, (Mariappa 83); Ledley 6, McArthur 7.5, Puncheon 6.5; Gayle 8, Sanogo 5.5 (Murray 79), Zaha 7 (Gudeiora 70, 6). Subs not used: Hennessey, Hangeland, Campbell, Thomas. Booked: Dann, Ward, Sanogo. Scorers: Gayle 28, 87, Puncheon 48. Referee: Phil Dowd 6 . ‘If you don’t get teams on the back foot, they will grow in confidence and grind you down. The (group of forwards) are better than they think they are. I keep trying to tell them.’ Gayle has responded, having scored only once in nine games before Pardew’s arrival, and now has double figures for the season. ‘The new gaffer has come in and instilled a little bit of confidence in the boys so we know we can come back from 2-0 down. We are all good players and we believe in each other, as it showed. ‘It’s about making sure we’re getting crosses into the box and shots off so we can score. ‘He’s boosted our confidence as a collective. He goes out there, gives everyone little pats on the back, talks to people individually, he’s got everyone going. For me to get 10 goals this season is a great achievement.’ Burnley raced into a 2-0 lead inside 12 minutes through Ben Mee and Danny Ings before caving in just as they had done in the FA Cup at Spurs last week.

"Dwight Gayle maintained Alan Pardew's 100 per cent record as Crystal Palace manager with a dramatic late winner as Burnley threw away a 2-0 lead for the second time in four days. In a typical relegation dogfight that had everything including snowstorms and Pardew digging out referee Phil Dowd at half-time, Gayle fired home his second goal for the game after 87 minutes to break Burnley hearts. While the Londoners climbed to 12th place as a result, Burnley are now just a point outside the drop zone and will fall into the bottom three if Hull City get a draw or better against West Ham on Sunday. Dwight Gayle celebrates his second and Crystal Palace's third as Alan Pardew's side fight back from two-goals down at Turf Moor . Gayle grabs his second of the game despite the attempted block from Burnley player Michael Keane at Turf Moor . It was a familiar feeling for both clubs. Palace came from behind to beat Spurs last weekend while Burnley were beaten 4-2 at Spurs in the FA Cup on Wednesday night having led 2-0. 'It was a famous and fabulous victory,' said Pardew, who has now won three on the trot since leaving Newcastle United to succeed Neil Warnock at Selhurst Park. 'We had to show tremendous qualities against a Burnley side that were on their mettle. Not just resilience but flair and bravery to pass the ball as well. Gayle is an uncomplicated player, two good feet, quick, can finish. Not much more you can ask for really!' Jason Puncheon is congratulated by Yaya Sanogo and his fellow Crystal Palace teammates after his second-half goal . For Dyche, he now has an almighty job lifting his players off the floor after another massive disappointment. 'I didn't feel comfortable at 2-0,' he admitted. 'We were just below-par for some reason. We didn't have our usual technical bravery.' A sharp, sudden snowstorm greeted both sets of players as they stepped out at Turf Moor and Burnley treated Palace as southern softies in the first 18 minutes as they raced into a two-goal lead. Crystal Palace striker Gayle halves Burnley's advantage with just under 30 minutes gone in the Premier League clash . Kieran Trippier's corner looped over Palace goalkeeper Julian Speroni allowing Ben Mee to head in from close range after losing his marker Joe Ledley in the 12th minute. Six minutes later, Joel Ward was robbed by Scott Arfield by the touchline as he tried to usher the ball out for a throw. He fed Danny Ings and the England under-21 striker finished low past Speroni. Pardew was unhappy with both goals. 'The corner wasn't taken from the quadrant for the first, and the officials didn't see their player (Arfield) dump our defender on the pitch, they were concentrating on whether the ball had crossed over the touchline,' he said.

But instead of feeling sorry for themselves, Palace – who could hardly score an away goal under Warnock – got busy. Wilfried Zaha and Gayle swapped flanks and it worked. Zaha, now on the right nearly set up James McArthur to score after 28 minutes and though Trippier got in a block, the ball fell to Gayle who fired in. Pardew approached referee Phil Dowd in the centre circle at half-time 'I didn't moan about the goals, it was because he wouldn't let us take a corner at the end of the half,' explained the Palace manager. His players were just as fired up and after 48 minutes Palace were level, Burnley defenders backing off as Jason Puncheon received a pass from Gayle and fired in from 20 yards. 'I had Punch at Southampton and he is a different player now, he has that inner confidence from playing in the Premier League,' said the Eagles boss. There was another late flurry of snow – and a late flurry of activity on the pitch too. James McArthur cleared off the line from Michael Keane and then Palace substitute Glenn Murray, who had replaced disappointing debutant Yaya Sanogo, struck a post. Then, with three minutes left, Murray used his body to help Puncheon's pass reach Gayle at the far post. The forward's take with his right foot was brilliant, and he then fired past Heaton with his left. The Eagles are soaring.

"Seventeen years, five clubs, twenty-three Ireland caps, ten operations, three metal pins – one in his ankle, one in his foot, one in his wrist. Five games this season, six months left on a Premier League contract at Burnley. The numbers all add up for Steven Reid. The body is still aching, the clock is ticking, but that desire to play, to still be relevant, will not go away. Steven Reid celebrates with Burnley team-mate Ben Mee after the 3-3 draw with Newcastle United . Reid comes off the bench to replace Burnley team-mate Kieran Trippier . And in Lancashire, nearer to the family home, Reid has found kindred spirits. Younger, yes, but with a manager and among a group of players who are fighting as one against the odds to stay in the Premier League. 'It is just a great atmosphere,' he said. 'At times you would think we were in the top four. I know you get tired of hearing teams in that part of the league saying that. But we come out of meetings feeling on top of the world. 'People have written us off from the start and rightly so because of the financial power of some teams and we have just been promoted but we have use that to our advantage and lads are playing with freedom. Reid closes down Newcastle's Yoan Gouffran to help Burnley to a precious point at St. James' Park . Reid slides in with a challenge on Sunderland's Frazier Campbell during a Premier League game in 2012 . Reid exchanges words with former Liverpool striker Luis Suarez at Anfield in 2013 . 'I enjoy coming in and working in the environment and seeing the hunger of the lads has been so refreshing. 'The back end of last season was tough with the position we were in at West Brom and looking around the dressing room you're asking questions about whether the players around you are giving everything. 'It's nice to go into the dressing room when you know everyone is working their balls off and nothing is being left on the training ground or on the pitch. 'I have been brought in to be a player but the gaffer was keen to have that Premier league experience and maybe to help give guidance to others who have never played at this level. 'And I want to feel I am having an input. I don't want to ever get to the stage where I am having no input on or off the pitch and just dawdling through. 'I have looked to be a good influence, even if it is just showing professionalism in the gym and in training. Hopefully one or two of the younger lads will see things have to be done if you want to play in the Premier league for an amount of time. 'Sometimes it takes a serious injury to give you a wake-up call and make you realise you are not going to go on forever.' Reid amassed 23 international caps for the Republic of Ireland between 2001 and 2008 . Reid has learned that lesson the hard way. By his own admission, he is now obsessed with warm-ups, warm-downs and anything in between. Keeping his body in the right state after 10 operations has become paramount. Rewind seven years ago to the opening months of Giovanni Trapattoni's reign as Ireland manager. Reid played centre midfield in the first three games and was outstanding when the World Cup 2010 qualifiers started with wins in Germany and over Georgia and a hard-earned goalless draw in Montenegro. Trapattoni left Podrica that night believing he had solved Ireland's central midfield problem. Reid left in agony. It was the last time he played for his country. Reid said: 'I hadn't trained for a couple of days before the Montenegro game because of an on-going problem with my knee. It was swollen on the plane going home and I knew I was in trouble. 'They were probably my three best games for Ireland but I had no idea that it was going to be the end of my international career. Trap played me in centre mid, I felt great and comfortable in that position and was happy with my performances. Unfortunately it was my last. 'I have mixed emotions looking back. It finally looked like I had forged a position in the team and it was looking good for me in that campaign. For it to be the end was tough. And Trap didn't exactly help when he wrote me off as I was recovering and said I wouldn't play at the top level again.' Reid (bottom left), lines up with Ireland ahead of the Group D qualifier against Germany in 2008 . In fact Reid needed surgery on his knee cartilage, a complication from the cruciate injury and surgery he had a year earlier which had ruled him out for seven months. He still remembers the day in training. 'I went into a tackle with David Bentley,' he said. 'I felt the crunch straightaway. It was not quite like anything I had encountered before – just a horrible sensation. 'He twisted round on top of me as we tackled and fell and my leg was trapped. I just couldn't do anything to prevent the force of him landing on top of me. 'I knew pretty much straight away it was bad. There was an awkward crunch and it blew up immediately. And you can always tell by the reaction of the physios when they had to test to see whether the cruciate intact. You can tell by their faces that you are in trouble. 'From the moment you start talking football you know how serious the cruciate injury is. That's the one you don't want. It's career threatening, even though the medical side has advanced so much that any decent knee surgeon can do a decent reconstruction and you are up and about pretty quickly.' But the pain and the swelling would not abate. He travelled to Colorado to see renowned knee surgeon Richard Steadman who delivered more bad news, and booked him in for surgery. There was then two months of total inactivity for his right leg and by the time he could put weight on it, his muscles had wasted away. Reid challenges Manchester United's winger Ryan Giggs while playing for Blackburn in 2008 . Sam Allardyce eventually decided Reid could move on from Ewood Park, but without Blackburn physios Dave Fevre and Paul Kelly and strength and conditioning coach Adrian Lamb, Reid might never have recovered. The pair set up the 9am Club at Ewood and got away from the training ground, climbing England's highest mountain Scafell Pike and its sister Great Gable. Reid said: 'Adrian's family have a farm in the Lake District so he suggested we went up there. The weather was terrible, and Great Gable was really steep and harsh but it was brilliant fun. 'The last seven years have been a constant battle with not only the physical but the mental side of it. When you are constantly doing rehab and coming back from career threatening injuries it takes its toll on the body and mind. 'You have to get your head round it quickly. You know you are going to be out for a while so you have to set targets and just get on with it. It's important to have little bits and pieces to do in the gym, to have a good relationship with the medical staff. 'You hear people say play as long as you can but 10 surgeries starts to take its toll on how you live your daily life. 'It affects when you can go out for a long walk or play football in the garden with the kids because the knee is swollen or you know you have to prepare for a game. It affects family life and what you do on your day off.' Reid made 82 Premier League appearances for West Brom during a four year spell at the Hawthorns . And it's tough turning down thigh traps in the back garden with five-year-old son Harry and older sister Isla. Harry suffers from a rare and incurable eye condition nystagmus which causes the eyeball to move uncontrollably, resulting in problems with vision, balance and co-ordination, depending on its severity. Reid, now a patron of the Nystagmus Network, added: 'We have been lucky with the degree of the condition. He's doing really well just now but as things become more serious at school and he develops we are going to have to watch it carefully. 'He is up to every level for a child his age and as he gets older he will need help and guidance in class but he's completely fearless and confident in the playground and playing his football.'

"Reading are leading the race for Chelsea midfielder Nathaniel Chalobah. Sportsmail reported on Tuesday that Watford and Ipswich had also made enquiries for the 20-year-old but Steve Clarke looks to have persuaded the Engalnd Under 21 international to join him at the Madejski Stadium. Chalobah was poised to join Bordeaux on loan but was prevented by the FIFA three-club rule which determined he had already played for Chelsea and Burnley and could not join another top flight side. Nathaniel Chalobah is looking for a loan move after his spell at Burnley came to an abrupt end . Chalobah has 21 caps for the England Under 21 side, and has also played for the Under 16, 17 and 19 sides . The young midfielder only made four appearances for Burnley while on loan and appeared for Chelsea's Under 21 side but they were deemed competitive games. Watford had Chalobah on loan in 2012 and are keen to give him a run of games as they bid to go up to the Premier League. Ipswich are better placed as they lie second in the Championship while Reading have a lot more ground to make up as Steve Clarke looks to ensure they move clear of the relegation zone first. The 20-year-old is highly rated at Chelsea and Jose Mourinho will be keen for Chalobah to sign for a club where he will play first-team football for the second half of the season. Steve Clarke (centre) would be interested in bringing Chalobah to Reading if they can break out the drop zone .

"Hull will pay up to £2.3m for Tom Ince, who signed for the club on a two-year deal in July. The England Under 21 international, was a free agent at the end of last season and subsequently signed a two-year deal with Hull, after his contract with the Tangerines expired. Ince is under 24 so Hull had to agree a compensation package with Blackpool to complete the signing of the 22-year-old on a permanent basis. They have now done so, without the need of a tribunal. Tom Ince joined Hull in the summer on a free transfer after leaving Blackpool at the end of his contract . Blackpool will receive up to £2.3m cmpensation for Ince because he was only 22 when he left for nothing . Ince has recently been on loan at Nottingham Forest for two months after finding opportunities difficult to come by in the Premier League. Steve Bruce said: ‘I think it’s a fair price. There has been a lot of hype about Tom and rightly so with what he did during his time at Blackpool. But, he’s only a young lad and he still has time to develop his game. ‘He has to be given time to find his way in the Premier League because there aren’t too many 22-year-olds playing regularly in the top-flight. ‘We’ve got to let Tom develop here. He’s done particularly well for us so far, we’re pleased with his progress but we still think there is more to come from him.’ The former Liverpool youth prospect scored 33 times in 113 appearances for Blackpool and was named the Football League Young Player of the Year in 2013.","Tom Ince joined Hull in July after his contract with Blackpool expired .

"Bradford's co-chairman Mark Lawn is hoping Sunderland beat Fulham in their FA Cup replay to set up a fifth-round tie at Valley Parade. Sunderland, famous giant-killers themselves from when they beat Leeds in the 1973 final, were held by Sky Bet Championship side Fulham in a goalless draw at the Stadium of Light on Saturday and the two sides will meet again next week. Lawn, co-chairman Julian Rhodes and Bradford manager Phil Parkinson had all wanted to be paired with Manchester United after Saturday's stunning triumph over Chelsea at Stamford Bridge. Bradford City co-chairman Mark Lawn is hoping the club can claim another Premier League scalp . Bradford City's fourth-round win over Chelsea on Saturday was one of the biggest upsets in recent history . The Bantams' 4-2 win at Stamford Bridge has made them hungry to face more Premier League opposition . But Lawn had no complaints after Bradford were drawn to play either Sunderland or Fulham at home in Monday night's draw and has good reason to cheer on Gus Poyet's Black Cats in their replay. 'If we can't get Man United, Liverpool or Arsenal, let's have a home draw. It's up to us now,' Lawn said. 'We're the lowest-ranked team left in it, apart from Cambridge, and the odds are stacked against us, but let's give it our best shot. 'If we play like we did against Chelsea we will take some stopping. 'I would prefer Sunderland because of my mother. She was a Mackem. I lost her in 1993 and she was one of 13 children, so imagine how many cousins I've got! 'She moved down here just after the war and worked in Harry Ramsden's. That's where she met my dad.' Sunderland were held to a 0-0 draw with Fulham in their fourth-round tie at the Stadium of Light . The Stadium of Light was at less than half capacity as Sunderland and Fulham both drew a blank . Gus Poyet's side are on a bad run of form and have won just two of their last 14 games in all competitions . League One side Bradford's 4-2 win at Chelsea is one of the biggest cup upsets of all time and follows just less than two years after Parkinson steered the West Yorkshire club on a fairytale journey to Wembley in the League Cup final. Parkinson led the Bantams to promotion via the League Two play-off final later that season and although he was rewarded with a new three-year contract soon after, the club's latest cup exploits will inevitably lead to questions over his longer-term future. 'He's still got 18 months left on his contract so everyone can bugger off!' Lawn responded. 'It would have to be something very special to take him from here. His family live in the area and I'm sure they're all very happy here. 'That would end up being down to Phil, but of course we want to keep him.' Bradford have performed well in recent cup competitions and reached the League Cup final in 2013 .","Mark Lawn wants Bradford to repeat their heroics from Stamford Bridge .

"An anxious wait lies in store for Michel Vorm. After his calamitous mistake gifted Leicester a passage to the FA Cup fifth round, Mauricio Pochettino could be forgiven for calling on Hugo Lloris to step in when Tottenham arrive at Sheffield United on Wednesday. The Capital One Cup semi-final second leg at Bramall Lane is his most important game yet as manager. Spurs haven't won any silverware for seven years and Pochettino knows a night in Yorkshire is set to be tricky enough without the potential for any self-inflicted pain. He will have watched Vorm allow a tepid stoppage-time Jeffrey Schlupp volley bobble over him and wonder whether it's worth risking not starting with Lloris. Michel Vorm is concerned that he may not play again soon after his mistake against Leicester City . Vorm (left) conceded a goal from Jeffrey Schlupp as Tottenham lost 2-1 and went out of the FA Cup . The Frenchman is rivalled only by David de Gea as the Premier League's best between the sticks. With that in mind, Pochettino's decision seems clearcut. Vorm was actually lucky to still be on the pitch at the time of his howler after referee Robert Madley ludicrously felt Andrej Kramaric had dived when clearly fouled in the box. Regardless, Vorm wants an opportunity to make amends. 'I don't play that much so these kind of games are very important,' he admitted. 'I said sorry to the boys but they were 'Don't be silly, you did very well'. But you feel a responsibility. 'To be honest they did not say to me that you will be playing in the FA Cup and Capital One Cup, I just hear it the day before a game. But I hope they still give me the chance to play on Wednesday. 'It is hard and Sheffield will play the game of their lives probably. If we don' t understand the importance of the game for the club and fans then we don't deserve it. But we will. I am 100 per cent sure we will.' The ramifications of the gaffe, however, are likely to linger for Vorm — even if he is given the nod. Vorm is second choice for Tottenham behind Hugo Lloris - widely considered as one of the best in the league . Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino must decide whether to continue with Vorm against Sheffield United . 'It will (play on my mind) but you have to go on,' he added. 'I am 31 and I have dealt with worse. That is part of the life. Iker Casillas makes mistakes, so why couldn't I?' One man who didn't fluff his lines was Leonardo Ulloa, who brilliantly equalised for the Foxes and is now gearing himself up for a first trip to Old Trafford on Saturday. Manchester United hold no fears for Nigel Pearson's side, the striker argues. Doing the double against Louis van Gaal's Reds is not beyond the realms of possibility — particularly after this sure-footed performance at White Hart Lane. 'We need to play with the same intensity. We must play strong because we know they take the ball always but we must defend well and use the counter attack,' Ulloa said. 'They are not as good as in the past seasons but we must press more there. 'Now against Manchester United we believe we have a chance because we always create chances and we created many chances against Tottenham.' Ulloa is right. Leicester saw opportunities come and go before they finally dumped Pochettino's Spurs out of the Cup. Leonardo Ulloa (centre) celebrates equalising for Leicester in the game against Tottenham on Saturday . Nigel Pearson (left) feels the result will add to the belief that Leicester can stay in the Premier League . For a delighted Pearson, it is that attacking ingenuity which will prove key if they are to back up the shock 5-3 win earlier in the season. 'They are the games we've been aspiring to play for a decade,' he said. 'There' s no point in being anything other than positive and look forward to them. 'It's not exactly a straightforward one, but I think we've shown here and places like Liverpool that we can be a threat.'","Michel Vorm is second choice in goal for Tottenham behind Hugo Lloris .

"Leicester manager Nigel Pearson feels his side showed they do have what it takes to get the results needed to stay in the Barclays Premier League after coming from behind to dump Tottenham out of the FA Cup at White Hart Lane. The Foxes, bottom of the top-flight, produced a battling display to stun Spurs with two late goals on Saturday. Leonardo Ulloa cancelled out a first-half penalty from Spurs midfielder Andros Townsend before Jeff Schlupp stabbed a stoppage-time winner past flapping goalkeeper Michel Vorm to send them into the fifth-round draw. Nigel Pearson watches on from the touchline at White Hart Lane on Saturday . Pearson (left) and Spurs boss Mauricio Pochettino (right) greet each other prior the game at White Hart Lane . Pearson believed the result was all the more impressive given the injustice of seeing Andrej Kramaric, the £9million signing making his full debut, booked for diving when he should have been awarded a penalty after being tripped by Vorm. Leicester, who are three points adrift of safety, travel to Manchester United next weekend, then host rejuvenated Crystal Palace before heading to Arsenal. Pearson is confident the manner of the victory at White Hart Lane can stand his squad in good stead for the challenges ahead. 'We have found life in the Premier League harder than we would have liked, but the players have shown an awful lot of mental resilience,' he said. 'We have been playing well in a lot of games and not getting the results performances have warranted . Leicester City drew level through Leonardo Ulloa late on before they went on to win the tie . Jeffrey Schlupp celebrates after scoring the winning goal in added time in north London . 'So from being a team which was winning every week last season (in the Championship) to not being able to find the results can be a psychological hurdle to overcome. 'The learning curve of being able to be competitive in the top flight is about being efficient in both boxes and we have not always taken chances when they have come, and we have been punished severely for minor errors. 'But (with victory at Spurs) we have shown we are capable, so it is important we look at what is happening realistically - there is no point going overboard because we have won a cup game, but our performance has been very encouraging. 'We showed resilience and know-how, and created chances.' Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino made no less than nine changes from the side which had started the midweek Capital One Cup semi-final win over Sheffield United. Andros Townsend had given Tottenham the lead from the penalty spot against Leicester . However, the Argentine coach insists that should not have made a difference as Spurs were made to pay for not killing off Leicester. Spurs must, though, quickly regroup as they head to Bramall Lane on Wednesday night defending a slender 1-0 lead in the battle to reach Wembley. 'It is important to keep our motivation and confidence, because we need to play on Wednesday with our best performance, it will be a really tough game,' he said. Vorm, who could yet retain his place in the side next week, admits the manner of the defeat was tough to take, the Dutchman having earlier kept his side in the tie with a couple of fine saves before his untimely gaff allowed Schlupp's shot to roll over the goalline. 'If that (mistake) happens earlier in the game, maybe you can turn it around, but at the end makes it even worse,' Vorm said on Spurs TV. 'When the ball goes in, it is horrible, but that is football. 'I am gutted now, but you have to go on because there is another big game ahead on Wednesday and we have to focus on that as quickly as possible.'","Leicester beat Tottenham 2-1 on Saturday at White Hart Lane in their FA Cup third round tie .

"Despite turning Chelsea down on at least two occasions, Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard has scored as many goals for the them as he has against them. As the former England captain prepares to pack his bags and head for Major League Soccer, an astonishing stat has emerged: Gerrard has played Chelsea 39 times in his Liverpool career, but has managed just one goal against them. It came in the Premier League in 2005, when a 25-year-old Gerrard, fresh from lifting a Champions League trophy five months earlier, netted to level the match at 1-1. Steven Gerrard has played against Chelsea 39 times in his Liverpool career, but has only scored one goal . Gerrard led Liverpool to the Capital One Cup semi-final this season, but they were knocked out on Tuesday . Frank Lampard had put Jose Mourinho's side 1-0 up from the penalty spot before Gerrard's leveller, but even his one goal against them did not end in success as Damien Duff, Joe Cole and substitute Geremi made it a day to forget for Liverpool as they crashed 4-1. The previous February, Gerrard had scored a goal for Chelsea in the League Cup final in Cardiff. After John Arne Riise's early strike, the captain's unfortunate deflection from a Paulo Ferreira free-kick saw him on the scoresheet for all the wrong reasons, and his day was made worse by Chelsea's eventual extra-time win. Gerrard scored an own goal against Chelsea in the Carling Cup final at Cardiff in February 2005 . The Liverpool captain diverted a Paulo Ferreira free-kick into his own net as Chelsea won the match 3-2 . No goals against the Blues in the following decade have resulted in a rather unfortunate record that is likely to stay with Gerrard for the rest of his career. Tuesday night saw him take to the field against Chelsea for the 39th time, but he was unable to stop an extra-time winner from Branislav Ivanovic, ending his hopes of lifting the Capital One Cup at Wembley in March. Now, the FA Cup represents Gerrard's final chance to lift a trophy in Liverpool colours. The Reds travel to Bolton next Wednesday, where a tie against Crystal Palace awaits in the fifth round if they come through. Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho (left) consoles Gerrard after the League Cup final in 2005 . Gerrard (second left) celebrates his only goal against Chelsea - five months after his Carling Cup own goal . He does, though, have one final chance to score against Mourinho's side. Liverpool travel to Stamford Bridge on May 9, in what is set to be Gerrard's third-to-last Premier League game for the club. With the title out of Liverpool's grasp, the match will potentially have a bearing on whether Anfield will experience Champions League football again next season. If not that, then it is simply a chance for Gerrard to improve his poor record.","Steven Gerrard has scored as many goals for Chelsea as against them .

"Jonathan Walters thinks Stoke will effectively be taking on Premier League opposition when they visit his old club Blackburn in the fifth round of the FA Cup. The Potters have been rewarded for their fourth-round win over Rochdale with a game at Ewood Park in the last 16. The trip to Lancashire will bring back good memories for Stoke manager Mark Hughes, who enjoyed a successful four-year spell in charge at Blackburn, and Walters is looking forward to returning to the club where he began his professional career even though his time there ended in acrimonious circumstances. Jonathan Walters scored Stoke City's fourth goal in their 4-1 win over Rochdale in the FA Cup fourth-round . Walters says the upcoming fifth-round tie against Blackburn Rovers represents a stern test for The Potters . Stoke, the fifth-highest ranked team left in the hat, were pitted against lower-league opposition in the last two rounds, and even though Blackburn are in the Championship, Walters believes Rovers are so good they should be considered a top-flight team. 'It will be a tricky tie,' said Walters, who scored the last goal in the 4-1 rout at Spotland. 'They are a Premier League team. It's a Premier League set-up, they have a Premier League training ground, academy and stadium and they have very passionate fans so it will be a good game.' Blackburn gave Walters his first professional contract after spotting the teenager playing for Shaftesbury Under-16s in the Eastham & District Junior League. The striker was a prolific scorer in the youth sides and at reserve level, but his rise at Ewood Park came to an abrupt halt when he was sold to Bolton after a 'breach of club discipline'. Championship side Blackburn knocked out Premier League Swansea City in the FA Cup fourth-round . Rovers are currently 10th in the Championship table while Stoke are 10th in the Premier League . The 31-year-old enjoyed a visit to Ewood Park with Stoke in pre-season though and he is looking forward to going back to the club in two-and-a-half weeks. 'I started there as a young boy so I knew a few people who are still at the club and I saw them in pre-season so it will be exciting times,' Walters said. 'I am sure it will be a good match. I saw a couple of the people I know in pre-season so it will be good to see them again.' Walters was part of the Stoke team that reached the FA Cup final in 2011, where they lost 1-0 to Manchester City at Wembley. He believes a cup run will not hinder the club's chances of finishing in the top half of the Premier League as well. 'A good cup run gives you momentum in the league,' he said.

Their last meeting with Fulham came further back in 1994, a 0-0 draw. Bradford were not the only side to cause a shock at the weekend, with Middlesbrough's 2-0 win at Manchester City equally worth of praise. Aitor Karanka's Championsip high-flyers will now head to holders Arsenal, who beat Brighton on Sunday.

"Mark Hughes said the fear of falling victim to another FA Cup upset inspired his Stoke team to a 4-1 victory over Rochdale. Chelsea, Manchester City and Tottenham all exited the competition over the weekend while Manchester United were held to a draw at Sky Bet League Two Cambridge. But Stoke did not fall into the same trap as their rivals as goals from Bojan Krkic, Stephen Ireland, Jon Walters and Victor Moses were enough to see off League One Rochdale on Monday night. Bojan fired home a stunning volley in the opening minutes to put Stoke in front against Rochdale . Victor Moses squeezed a shot in from near the byline to add gloss to Stoke's victory at Rochdale . Mark Hughes did not want his side to be knocked out of the FA Cup by lower league opposition . 'I mentioned what happened to the players over the weekend before the match. It would have been foolish not to,' the Stoke manager said. 'I needed to make sure there was a real focus to us as a group. 'There was a reason why the television cameras were here - people were hoping for an upset, but we didn't want to be a part of that. We didn't want it to happen.' Ireland put Stoke 2-0 up just after the break, then Moses scored a stunning curler for the Potters' third and Walters rounded the win off from close range after Rhys Bennett's consolation goal for the hosts. But the best goal of the night was Stoke's first, which was scored by their star player Bojan. The 24-year-old, who has now scored five goals since his move from Barcelona, hammered a left-foot-volley past Josh Lillis from 22 yards after Dale had looped the ball clear from their own box. Soon after the in-form forward hobbled off with a knee injury. Bojan receives treatment after falling awkwardly on his knee as he raced through on the Rochdale goal . Bojan had to be replaced by Stephen Ireland and the Spaniard was later seen leaving the ground on crutches . Hughes hopes the Spaniard, who has been a revelation for the Potters this term, is not out for a long time. 'There is a concern there for us,' Hughes said. 'We don't know how bad it is. He has gone back home and we will check him in the morning. 'He is due for a scan so hopefully he will be okay. 'Hopefully if the scan is clear he will be okay and it is just a short-term thing but at the moment it's a concern for us.' Hughes thoroughly enjoyed watching Bojan's effort fly in from just outside the box. 'It was an outstanding goal,' the Welshman said. 'He showed his qualities once again and it will be disappointing if we lose him for any length of time, but if you do others have to step up to the mark. Ireland doubled Stoke's advantage in the second half to leave them firmly in the driving seat . Rhys Bennett fired home in the final minutes to score a consolation for League One Rochdale . Jonathan Walters restored Stoke's three-goal advantage on the stroke of full time . 'Stephen Ireland came in and showed a lot of quality tonight. He always looked likely to score and he did tonight. 'If one door closes for one player, another opens.' Hughes is relishing a trip to his former club Blackburn in the fifth round. 'It will be good to go back,' said Hughes, who managed the Lancashire club for two years. 'I have good memories of my time there and there are lots of people I know still there. 'We will have a great following and it will be a real cup tie to look forward to.' Rochdale manager Keith Hill could have been celebrating a victory had his team taken their chances in the first half. Dale cut open the Stoke defence with ease, but Stephen Dawson and Matt Done failed to score. Hill said: 'We tried to attack with intent and press the opposition but they are an excellent side. Rochdale manager Keith Hill (right) was proud of his players despite the 4-1 defeat to Stoke . 'The game is marginal no matter where you stand in the pyramid. Fair play to Stoke, they were worthy winners in the end. 'The Bojan goal was a great piece of skill but it didn't frighten us. 'The lads have done the club credit. We were undone by four Premier League quality goals.'","Stoke won their FA Cup fourth round match against Rochdale 4-1 .

"Ben Davies has admitted that he was 'comfortable' during his time at Swansea City and that his move to Tottenham Hotspur has toughened him up. The 21-year-old left family and friends behind in Wales when he completed his £10million move to White Hart Lane. Davies, who has been vying for the left back spot with Danny Rose, says that the task he faces at Tottenham is much more demanding than what he faced in Wales. Ben Davies says his move to Tottenham 'toughened' him up as he found old club Swansea 'comfortable' Speaking to the London Evening Standard, he said: 'With the whole transition of coming away from my home-town club, I think I've had to get a good boost of ­self-­confidence and that's an important part of being at Tottenham. 'You have to be confident in yourself. Perhaps 'self-confidence' isn't exactly the right word but coming away from home toughens you up a bit. I'm only 21, an age when a lot of people are still living at home, I was comfortable at Swansea but I wanted the new challenge.' Davies is looking forward to tonight's match at Bramall Lane and says the game will be a 'battle' The left back says that despite the intense competition for places, he's learning a lot from the players around him. He said: 'I'm not here to blow my own trumpet but I do think I've improved as a player since I came to Tottenham. You learn from the players around you. People like Danny Rose and Jan ­Vertonghen, I've picked up a lot off those guys.' Davies says he is learning a lot from players like Danny Rose (left) and Jan Vertonghen (right) in training . Davies and his teammates face Sheffield United tonight in the Capital One Cup semi-final second leg, and the Welshman is excited about the clash at Bramall Lane. He added: 'There are a lot of players from across the world in this squad but the doggedness we British players tend to have can be a big help for us. It's nice that this game against Sheffield United might have 'the battle' about it.' Mauricio Pochettino's side take a slender 1-0 advantage into the second leg after Andros Townsend's penalty .

"Swansea director John van Zweden believes Wilfried Bony will be wasted at new side Manchester City as he will just sit on the bench. Bony sealed a £25million move to City from the south Wales side earlier this month and the fee could rise to £28m after add-ons. And while Van Zweden admits the 26-year-old's departure is a huge loss to Garry Monk's side, he thinks the Ivory Coast star will play second fiddle to Sergio Aguero and Co at the Etihad Stadium. He said: 'We will miss the goals from Wilfried Bony a lot. The most frustrating thing is that he will sit on the Manchester City bench. Wilfried Bony joined Manchester City from Swansea earlier this month . The 26-year-old was the top scorer in the Premier League during 2014 - netting 20 goals for his former side . Swansea director John van Zwerden believes Bony will be wasted at Premier League champions City . A Manchester City fan holds aloft a replica shirt with Bony's name and number on the back .

Daniel Sturridge (Liverpool) - 13 . 'Sergio Aguero remains their main striker. I'd personally love Wilfried to be at the heart of a top club like City.' Van Zweden also believes the highly-rated forward left the Swans on the cheap - despite his huge price tag. He added: 'If Manchester United were able to get as much as they did for Luke Shaw, then the money they have paid for Bony, the Premier League’s top scorer in 2014, is still on the very low side.' Bony could make his debut for City in the top-of-the-table clash with Chelsea this Saturday, if his country crash out of the Africa Cup of Nations when they play Cameroon on Wednesday.","Wilfried Bony sealed a £28m move to Manchester City earlier this month .

"The magic of the FA Cup isn't always as magical as supporters might like. But this year's fourth round had more than enough shocks to justify the cliché for another year at least. Both of the Premier League's top two clubs were knocked out while Manchester United failed to score against minnows Cambridge United and Liverpool stumbled at home to Bolton Wanderers. Here, Sportsmail's Matt Barlow looks back at the highs, lows, heroes and zeros. Bradford City players celebrate after beating Chelsea 4-2 at Stamford Bridge on Saturday afternoon . ALL BETS OFF AS BRADFORD LEAD GIANT-KILLING PARADE . It was much like most Sundays for Bradford City boss Phil Parkinson as he set out to watch son Jack play for Tockwith Juniors. But some things were certainly not normal in the North Yorkshire village. There was the Sky Sports camera crew, for a start, and his phone buzzing continually with messages of congratulation. And an invitation to appear on Match of the Day 2. This is what happens when your League One team knocks Chelsea out of the FA Cup, but Bradford’s was not the only surprise on a weekend when the Football League humbled the Premier League. No-one saw it coming, except perhaps the 24-year-old Doncaster plumber who won nearly £3,000 with a tenner bet on Bradford and Middlesbrough. Most wagers were destroyed by Bradford or Boro, winners at Man City, or Blackburn, who beat Swansea, or Bolton, who drew at Anfield, or Fulham, who held Sunderland, or Cambridge — who earned a replay against Manchester United. Middlesbrough striker Patrick Bamford celebrates after scoring for his side against Manchester City . Sheffield United’s FA Cup replay against Preston North End will be their 15th cup game of this season coming soon after the Capital One Cup semi-final, second leg against Tottenham on Wednesday — their seventh game in that competition. There have also been two games in the Johnstone’s Paint Trophy, and the replay against Preston will be their sixth FA Cup match of the season. Defender Bob Harris has appeared in all 13 so far, starting a dozen and coming off the bench at Deepdale on Saturday. Harris has made 35 appearances already this season. A PARTING SHOCK FROM PUNDIT WISE . Is it Wig-an or is it Barnet? No, it’s former Wimbledon and Chelsea star Dennis Wise sporting an odd new hairdo when he appeared as a pundit on Ireland’s Setanta Sport. Twitter observers compared him to a character from The Lego Movie or Montgomery Burns from The Simpsons. Dennis Wise's haircut created a storm on Twitter after his appearance as a TV pundit on Setanta Sports . There were some cold spots amid their warm glow of affection for the famous old trophy. What was going on at Blackburn, for example, where fewer than 6,000 turned up for the lunchtime kick-off? Perhaps they stayed at home and picked it up on BBC Wales, but they missed the thrill of witnessing referee Craig Pawson take his red-card tally to seven in 15 games as two former Cardiff players, Rudy Gestede and Craig Conway, ended Swansea’s Cup hopes. Fewer than 6,000 people turned up to watch Blackburn Rovers win against Swansea City . HERO . Phil Parkinson for having the courage to play open and aggressive football at Stamford Bridge and refusing to change tactics when Bradford went two down. His players responded to create one of the biggest FA Cup shocks ever but Parky, after leading his team to the Capital One Cup final, is proving once again that there are talented British coaches working in the Football League. ZERO . Louis van Gaal for his sour response to Cambridge United’s heroics, moaning about the pitch, the referee, while refusing to acknowledge rival boss Richard Money. It was a sharp contrast to Jose Mourinho at Chelsea, who shared drinks with Bradford’s staff despite being choked by his defeat. Phil Parkinson (left) was the weekend's hero while the ungracious Louis van Gaal (right) was the zero . CAMBRIDGE HEROICS HELP FIRE UP THE FANS . Cambridge United sparked all that weekend drama by resisting Manchester United on Friday. The goalless draw was watched live on BBC One by an armchair audience of more than seven million. Then, more than 300,000 climbed off their sofas, pulled on hats and scarves and chicken costumes — whatever was to hand — to attend the 11 ties on Saturday, including some vast armies of travelling support. Six thousand Bradford fans will never forget their day out at Chelsea, while the 5,500 West Brom fans who saw the latest instalment of Victor Anichebe’ s resurgence was apparently their largest away following in seven years. Bolton provided 60 free coaches to ferry fans to Anfield, while nearly 6,000 Chesterfield supporters made the short trip south to Derby as almost 29,000 enjoyed the first county derby since 1986. It was a close-fought contest which proved football in Derbyshire is in rude health. Cambridge, by the way, have been offered 9,000 tickets for next week’s replay at Old Trafford. It will be interesting to see if the Beeb stick with their story, or are tempted by possible upsets elsewhere, like Liverpool at Bolton or Sunderland at Fulham. Cambridge United's draw with Manchester Untied was watched by seven million people on BBC One . Garry Monk's decision to rest so many first-team regulars was perhaps the most puzzling decision of the weekend, though Swansea’s boss will feel his side would have won had they not been at least one man short for most of the game. None of the Capital One Cup semi-finalists won as they tinkered with rotation. Tottenham and Chelsea made nine changes and lost at home. Sheffield United and Liverpool drew, after making eight and five changes respectively. West Ham boss Sam Allardyce, fielding a full-strength XI at Bristol City, said the fourth round was ‘the most astounding weekend ever’ in FA Cup history. Swansea City defender Kyle Bartley was sent off by referee Craig Pawson in just the seventh minute of play . BOGDAN TOPS WANTED LIST . Bolton goalkeeper Adam Bogdan produced a fabulous display at Anfield and his timing could barely have been better. Liverpool are one of the clubs monitoring Bogdan, aware that he is out of contract at the end of the season and resisting Bolton’s efforts to re-sign. The 27-year-old Hungarian was making only his second appearance since August and he responded with an array of brilliant saves to frustrate Liverpool and secure a lucrative replay for the Championship club. He has kept clean sheets in two FA Cup ties, which will alert more clubs to his availability on a free transfer in the summer. Several Bundesliga clubs had scouts in the Anfield crowd. Bolton rejected a bid of £1.2million last summer from Mainz, who are still keen. Stuttgart and Hannover are also watching and there is interest from clubs in the Barclays Premier League, including Crystal Palace.

"Gus Poyet has accused Sunderland’s supporters of pining for Kevin Phillips and Niall Quinn and the ‘kick and rush’ football of Peter Reid’s team. The Black Cats finished seventh in consecutive seasons at the turn of the millennium with Phillips and Quinn forming one of the Premier League’s most feared strike partnerships. But on Saturday Poyet’s side were booed off at half-time and at the end of a sour stalemate with Fulham, in which Jermain Defoe made his home debut and Jack Rodwell was sent off. Sunderland manager Gus Poyet was bemused as to why his team were being booed during the Fulham draw . Jermain Defoe (left) could not break the deadlock for Sunderland on his FA Cup return . Midfielder Jack Rodwell (right) was sent-off for Sunderland in the second half . The Uruguayan, though, has some harsh words for the club’s followers. ‘I understand the booing at the end and at half-time probably, but during the game when a team-mate passes the ball, I don’t,’ he said. ‘My message to them is patience. And I am sorry I can’t bring Niall Quinn and Kevin Phillips back. I think they (the fans) are still living in the past. You cannot live in the past. ‘On top of that, you have to remember how Peter Reid left the club (sacked in 2002). They forgot very quickly about what Peter achieved, and that is very unfair.’ Poyet, meanwhile, says the high-tempo playing style employed by Reid is now redundant in the modern game. ‘I think it was kick and rush,’ he said. ‘People think they were very good because of the way they played - it was excellent and worked perfectly for Quinn and Phillips in particular. ‘It is a way if playing and I respect it. I suffered myself here, 4-0 at half-time, but I don’t think too many teams in the Premier League play it now.’ Poyet says fans want to see the team play in the way that was seen when Niall Quinn (right) was at the club . Kevin Phillips was Quinn's strike partner and the duo are fondly remembered by Sunderland fans . Peter Reid (left) was the manager at the time but Poyet wants his side to play with a different style . Sunderland supporters may well argue that ‘kick and rush’ is better than the dross served up at the Stadium of Light this season, where they have won just once in the league. And Poyet is concerned about the disconnect with those in the stands. ‘Yes, it worries me,’ he said. ‘It worries me a lot. ‘But it is up to me to find a solution to connect with the fans through better play, whatever that system is, whether through passing, or going long. It is up to me, I am responsible. ‘At the moment it is not nice to watch, I can understand that. All I can say is I promise you I will try to find a way to bring more excitement to the stadium.’","Gus Poyet concerned about the growing discontent from Sunderland fans .

"Ronny Deila’s knowledge of Glasgow’s most emotive derby has been gleaned by proxy. From the tales, glories and disappointments of the men by his side. From snatched clips on YouTube. The first manager of Celtic ever to have gone seven months in the job without playing Rangers, his inexperience has so far been tolerated. Indulged even. That won’t last if he notches up another landmark by becoming the first Parkhead manager ever to lose to a lower-league Ibrox outfit. A League Cup semi-final at Hampden offers no margin for error. By his own admission, Deila has been forced to bone up on the meaty side of his Glasgow induction through the anecdotes of his backroom lieutenants. Ronny Deila (left) poses with the Scottish League Cup alongside Rangers manager Kenny McDowall (right) Deila wants the Old Firm derby to pass without trouble between Celtic and Rangers supporters . ‘I have John Collins and John Kennedy around me who have played in these games before,’ said the former Stromsgodset coach. ‘I have heard about Collins’ free-kick (when Celtic won 2-0 at Ibrox in 1994) and everything. The whole club is thinking and talking about it, so I have some idea what it is. ‘I have also watched a couple of games from before to get a little bit of feeling about the atmosphere. It is going to be a big day.’ It’s hardly unheard of for an Old Firm managerial debutant to have no previous experience of the fixture on his CV. Neither Martin O’Neill or Dick Advocaat had played for either Celtic or Rangers. Both won a domestic treble in their first seasons in charge. Gordon Strachan had witnessed many Glasgow derbies, but found his inexperience of playing one no barrier to winning trophies. Experience of playing in the fixture, then, is not essential. Neither can anyone say for certain that it even matters. Deila (left) and McDowall (second left) pose with Derek McInnes (second right) and Jackie McNamara (right) ‘It’s very hard to say,’ shrugged Deila. ‘But I have experienced big matches before. I have fought for trophies before and it’s the same problems you encounter going into them all. ‘I know how to cope with the pressure and that’s the most important thing.’ Predicting how a manager or player will fare in his first Old Firm game is largely pointless. O’Neill won his first derby 6-2. England icon Paul Gascoigne turned in a virtuoso display in a 2-1 Rangers win at Parkhead, while Lubo Moravcik’s debut in a 5-1 win is still regaled by Celtic fans. None of that exalted trio had ever sampled the white-hot heat generated by the game before, but found their ignorance a form of bliss. Deila, nevertheless, will leave nothing to chance. The key to winning his first Old Firm game, he believes, could lie in his right-hand men Collins and Kennedy. ‘That’s vital,’ conceded the Celtic boss. ‘I am so happy to have staff who know Scottish football. ‘That not only helps me in this situation, but through the whole season. ‘I didn’t know much about the other teams, the players and culture. ‘It’s much easier to get it when you have other people next to you.’ John Barnes had Kenny Dalglish, of course. Jozef Venglos had Eric Black. It did neither man much good in the end. Deila celebrates in front of Celtic fans after victory over Ross County last weekend in the Scottish league . The Norwegian was compared unflatteringly - unfairly - to Barnes in his early months. They are more forgiving now, but no one is comparing to him to an O’Neill or Strachan just yet and it may be some time before they do. Sunday and his first Rangers win would be a decent foundation. Collins and Kennedy are not his only points of reference. Scott Brown, Mikael Lustig, Kris Commons, Adam Matthews, Emilio Izaguirre, Anthony Stokes and the injured Charlie Mulgrew have all sampled the fixture. Deila will make a point of speaking to them all. ‘We are a team, the staff and me and the players,’ he continued. ‘I have spoken to them a lot, not only this week but all the time. Good communication is important. ‘I think this game is going to be much louder than I am used to but that is why I am managing. You train out in the cold 50 per cent of the time because you are looking forward to these days. ‘I don’t think it is going to be too emotional before the game, because you so concentrated on what you are going to do. ‘But hopefully if we have a good result it is easier to enjoy the feelings and the emotions. ‘Football is not always fun when you play, but it is fun afterwards. Everything you have seen and experienced you can then take it in and I think it will be a great experience.’ It’s only fun after a victory, of course. Even then, the prevailing, dominant emotion is relief. The fear of defeat has always trumped the joy of victory when Celtic and Rangers meet. Deila wants his team to consider the FA Cup shocks in England to make sure they avoid complacency . For the Scottish champions, there is an additional pressure borne of their tag as overwhelming favourites. They are expected to not only win but to win well. ‘It is something extra because it is a derby and you want to win the city,’ Deila added. ‘It is a bigger match than a normal semi-final. ‘I understand the expectations and you all understand my expectations, as well. ‘But this is not the first time in my life there is an expectation to win. It is how you handle that which is the most important thing.’ Discipline - on the field as much as off - will be key. In any given press conference, Deila will use the word ‘energy’ three or four times, sometimes more. His key message to his players is to ignore the negative, sometimes ugly and abrasive energy from the stands and the hype generated by the game and keep it for where it matters. On a football pitch. In the coming days, Celtic players will be urged to don blinkers and shut out the nonsense around them. Leading by example, Deila said: ‘I haven’t met anyone. I have been in Lennoxtown the whole week. But I know where I can go and where I should go. ‘I know the expectations and want to save my energy for Sunday. You have to choose yourself where you go and what you do. ‘That’s what I said to them the first day I met them. We talk about it all the time. ‘Use your energy for something you can actually do something about.’","Sunday's Celtic and Rangers Old Firm tie is the first in nearly three years .

"West Ham are not worried about any potential FIFA ramifications in their ongoing feud with Senegal over the availability of Diafra Sakho. The striker pulled out of competing in the African Cup of Nations earlier this month on medical advice after sustaining a back injury - but co-owner David Sullivan insists they have done nothing wrong despite the 25-year-old's involvement with the Hammers. But Senegal coach Alain Giresse bemoaned Sakho's absence on Monday night after he featured, and score, for West Ham against Bristol City in the FA Cup at the weekend. West Ham striker Diafra Sakho celebrates scoring for West Ham but Senegal were not expecting him to play . Sakho played and scored for West Ham against Bristol City, despite pulling out of the AFCON with an injury . West Ham co-owner David Sullivan (right, next to David Gold) has hit back at criticism this week . Senegal lodged an official complaint with FIFA - demanding that the game's governing body take action. But Sullivan has emphatically hit back. 'A top back surgeon said Sakho can’t fly and he still can’t fly, he went by car to Bristol and is going by train to Liverpool,' Sullivan told Sportsmail. 'How can we go against medical advice? ‘We are sure any FIFA hearing will vindicate us. The player missed four games as a result of injuries incurred whilst playing for Senegal. We have done nothing untoward.’ Sakho scored the winner at Ashton Gate on Sunday and is set to be included in Sam Allardyce's squad to play Liverpool on Saturday. Senegal coach Alain Giresse revealed he was very surprised to learn Sakho had played against Bristol City . The tournament in Equatorial Guinea runs until February 8, and although Senegal have already crashed out, FIFA can stop Sakho appearing for the Hammers for the duration of the competition. That means he could miss the Premier League games against Liverpool and Manchester United, while they could issue a fine or an even longer ban. Senegalese fans also want the Hammers booted out of the FA Cup. They travel to West Brom in the fifth round next month. Giresse said earlier this week: ‘I’m very surprised to learn that he played. When you cannot fly for six weeks and then suddenly you’re playing a football game. There must be miraculous medicine in England. ‘This sets a dangerous precedent because in future you are going to have players claiming they cannot catch planes to Africa but who can still play football (for their clubs). It is a debate that deserves more discussion.’ Sakho was confronted by angry Senegal supporters on social media but fought his corner . Sakho has come in for criticism on social media after pulling out of the tournament, with one fan writing: 'Congratulations on your goal, I hope you never play for Senegal again, the Senegalese people feel betrayed.' Sakho responded: 'I took the time to browse all your reactions on social networks. Very quickly my joy from scoring and rescuing my club has turned into sadness and anger. 'Sadness because some of your words touched me deep in my person and my heart and this, without you knowing what has really happened. 'And great anger, because after all my struggles day after day, season after season to finally wear the jersey of my homeland, and my family, the only nation that matters to me - you doubt my love and my patriotism. 'My absence at CAN 2015 (the African Nations Cup), my first CAN, was not painless. 'The dream of contributing to the victory of my country got away from me this year, but it is not dead!

"There are some experiences in life which money simply cannot buy. As a son of Hamilton growing up a Rangers supporter, the Old Firm rivalry coursed through Barry Ferguson’s veins as soon as he was old enough to distinguish blue from green. Once resident at Ibrox, countless pep-talks and first-hand accounts of playing in the famous fixture were on tap from the former midfielder and club captain. Barry Ferguson (right) celebrates with his team-mates after Nacho Novo scored for Rangers in the Old Firm . And yet, reflecting now on his first taste of the game — a goalless draw at the outset of season 1998-99 — he believes words alone are inadequate to accurately convey the out-of-body experience that awaits Sunday’s debutants. ‘I probably touched the ball five or six times and I was poor,’ he recalled of the match at the outset of Dick Advocaat’s era in charge. ‘Everything flew past me and I learned to play better next time. ‘You honestly don’t know what to expect. I played in some games where it just flew past me and then the whistle went. Ferguson (left) argues with Celtic's Aiden McGeady as an Old Firm derby at Celtic Park gets heated . ‘I was left there thinking: “I didn’t even turn up there” because I hadn’t been involved, whereas in other games it was great. ‘It’s a strange game. Often there’s no point in shouting at your team-mates as they can’t hear you. ‘I had a mixture of emotions in the game and the emotion you want is a winning one. ‘If you get that, the fans have the bragging rights and that’s what you want. It’s not just for you and your team-mates, it’s for however many thousand fans are there supporting you, too. ‘You shouldn’t forget that.’ Ferguson’s career offers him a sharp sense of perspective on the Old Firm’s true standing in the British game. His first departure from Rangers saw him land at Blackburn Rovers, where jousts with near-neighbours Burnley were eagerly awaited. After battling with Neil Lennon (right) Ferguson takes on another Celtic player at Ibrox . A second spell in England with Birmingham City came with the rarefied atmosphere of the Midlands clash with Aston Villa. Meaty though both games were, Ferguson insists there was simply no comparison with the meeting of Celtic and Rangers. ‘I got told it (the Midlands derby) was going to be mental and it was just like a normal game,’ he shrugged. ‘After it, away from the ground, there were maybe a few riots but apart from that it was normal. ‘You can’t hear yourself talk when you’re in an Old Firm game. Don’t get me wrong, it’s still passionate down there but this is a different ball game.’ An occasion for experience if ever there was one then. Of Celtic’s likely starting side, only Adam Matthews, Emilio Izaguirre, Scott Brown, Kris Commons and Anthony Stokes have derby memories in their scrap books. Rangers captain Ferguson stands over an injured Andreas Hinkel during one of his many derby battles . For all their lower league status, Lee Wallace, Kenny Miller, Lee McCulloch and Kris Boyd are well placed to talk the Old Firm novices in the blue corner through an afternoon they are unlikely to forget in a hurry. All have a key role to play. ‘I’m sure they will have a massive influence on the dressing room,’ added Ferguson. ‘They will let people know what it’s all about.’ They could do a lot worse than listen to Ferguson’s list of dos and don’ts. The scorer of an equalising free-kick in Rangers’ 3-2 triumph in the 2002 Scottish Cup final, he also failed to see out the 90 minutes at Celtic Park two years previously as Martin O’Neill’s side ran riot in a 6-2 win. Given the sharply contrasting fortunes both sides of the great divide have experienced in recent years, many standing in the green corner feel a repeat of that latter score-line is not beyond the realms of possibility. Ferguson acknowledges that, for Rangers to prevail on Sunday, they will have to hit heights not seen too often of late, while Celtic’s levels will have to drop. In 2000, a young Ferguson (right) watches as Tony Vidmar (left) fights for the ball with Stiliyan Petrov . But, like half of Hampden Park, he feels that’s entirely possible. ‘Form goes out the window and it doesn’t matter what league you are in,’ he insisted. ‘Old Firm games are about who wants it most on the day. ‘It doesn’t matter if Celtic are top of the league and playing well while Rangers are going through a sticky patch. ‘There were times going into Rangers-Celtic games where we were having a hellish time and we won the game. ‘I know a lot of people say it but form and whatever league you’re in don’t matter. It’s a whole different ball game. ‘The atmosphere surrounding it and the week building up to the game are different. A lot of people are thinking it’s going to be an easy ride for Celtic but I don’t think so. ‘All that matters is the result.’ Ferguson (second left) and Madjid Bougherra (left) applaud the travelling Rangers supporters in 2009 . Ferguson learned quickly that sufficient random factors are always at play in the fixture to make betting on it a mug’s game. Bold predictions of acts of derring-do are ill-advised too. Pride coming before a fall, and all that. John Guidetti is perhaps a case in point. The Swede may indeed have said he hoped to score a hat-trick in the game, as opposed to him predicting it, but it was still dressing-room wall fodder. And this, too, from a man who’s recently looked as much as a goal threat as Craig Gordon. ‘You do your talking on the pitch, not off the pitch,’ Ferguson mused. ‘That’s the way I like it done. Be respectful and if you’ve got things you want to do on the pitch, do them. ‘Don’t speak out because you can end up with custard pie on your face.’ Three years in the making, Sunday’s clash will necessitate predictions from everyone from the working man to Heads of State. For those who have stood tall in the midst of a multi-coloured hurricane, such talk is fraught with danger. ‘Pundits have their say but I never took that into account because you need to actually be involved to realise what it’s all about,’ said the current Clyde manager. Man’s great enemy – time – means on Sunday, Ferguson will be as powerless as the rest of us to affect the outcome. What he’d give to sample it one more time, though. ‘My head says aye but my legs say differently,’ he smiled.","Barry Ferguson was at Rangers for two spells and was club captain .

"The Rangers Supporters Trust believe their legal action stopped Mike Ashley being given security over Ibrox this week – but they still harbour fears for the future. The fan-ownership group went to court on Monday seeking an interim interdict to prevent the Ibrox board from including the stadium in a deal with Ashley’s Sports Direct firm. Talks with club laywers then produced an agreement that ensures security over Ibrox cannot be granted until February 17. The Rangers Supporters Trust believe they stopped Mike Ashley being given security over Ibrox . Rangers have been troubled by off-field financial difficulties that have led to the club's plight . Advance notices of security submitted to the Registry of Scotland on behalf of Sports Direct a fortnight ago had suggested such a move was in the pipeline and prompted protests from supporters. But the terms of the £10 million loan – comprised of two £5 million tranches - announced on Tuesday instead included security over Murray Park, Edmiston House, Albion car park and club trademarks. The RST believe they only have a partial victory as they remain concerned about the gap between their agreement expiring and the forthcoming EGM, at which Dave King will seek to oust the current board. A date for that meeting is yet to be announced and could, under normal protocol, be at the end of next month. ‘Following detailed legal advice, the Rangers Supporters Trust (RST), with the financial backing of the Rangers Fans Fighting Fund (RFFF), submitted a petition to the Court of Session in Edinburgh on Monday 26th January, seeking an interim interdict to stop the Rangers board from granting security over Ibrox in favour of Sports Direct,’ said an RST statement. ‘Discussions between our lawyers and the board’s lawyers continued over the past three days. The conclusion of these discussions was the that board has agreed not to grant security over Ibrox for a period up until the 17th February covered by the advance notice they submitted. The Rangers Supporters Trust are still concerned about the future of the football club . ‘We are disappointed that we were not able to secure the extension of this commitment until the date of the upcoming EGM, as this now leaves a short period of time in which the board could grant security over Ibrox before they are hopefully removed. ‘This is particularly concerning given the announcement yesterday that a further period of due diligence is required for the second £5m tranche of debt that the board has decided to saddle the club with. ‘We believe our actions had a material impact in stopping the board from granting security over Ibrox. The revised deal with Sports Direct was agreed late on Monday night according to Paul Shackleton, the club’s AIM nomad. 'This was immediately following the petition submitted to the court, the announcement of which delayed what would have been a necessary interdict hearing in the Court of Session on Tuesday. ‘We do not believe that the filing of a notice of intention to grant security over Ibrox was an error and we believe that a fixed security over Ibrox would most likely have been granted to Sports Direct had it not been challenged. We would like to register our disappointment that it was necessary to take legal action to hold this board to their public promises to shareholders and fans. ‘Whilst we are pleased that the immediate danger posed to Ibrox has been averted, we share the anger of other fans at the latest act of corporate piracy perpetrated by the current Rangers directors. Dave King will seek to oust the current board at the next AGM . 'By accepting this deal with Sports Direct, they have plunged our club into an unnecessary level of debt and, by pawning off further revenue streams including shirt sponsorship, have limited our ability to repay that debt. ‘They have done this in their own interests and those of Mike Ashley. David Somers, Derek Llambias, James Easdale and Barry Leach have, in our opinion, neglected their duties to the PLC they are meant to represent.’","Rangers Supporters Trust believe they stopped Mike Ashley getting security over Ibrox .

"Luis Suarez returns to Barcelona’s line-up on Wednesday for the club’s biggest game of the season so far. Both Barca and Atletico Madrid are facing the quarter-final second leg as if it were a final, and with good reason – with Real Madrid already out of the way whoever progresses will feel they have one hand on the Cup. The winners of this tie, currently being led 1-0 by Barcelona, will face Villarreal or Getafe in the semi-final with one of Malaga, Sevilla, Espanyol and Athletic Bilbao awaiting them in the final. Suarez could have his first silverware by May if Barca finish the job on Wednesday and the form book plays out in the remaining rounds. He was rested against Elche at the weekend but comes back into a game which Atletico Madrid must face without arguably their most important player Diego Godin. Suarez’s Uruguayan team-mate is suspended and so marking duties will switch to another of his compatriot - the 20-year-old Jose Gimenez. Luis Suarez returns to Barcelona’s line-up on Wednesday for the club’s biggest game of the season so far . Lionel Messi celebrates after scoring against Atletico Madrid int he quarter-final first leg . With five goals in 16 games Suarez has not had the goalscoring start many expected but he has already scored against Atletico this season in the 3-0 league win two weeks ago. Barcelona are defending a 1-0 lead which means even a high-scoring defeat by a solitary goal will see them through. ‘People outside the dressing room might say we are favourites’ said Barca coach Luis Enrique. ‘But if we adopt that approach we will be making a big mistake. Of the three big teams left [in the competition] only one will still be standing but we have to make sure it is us.’ Atletico Madrid coach Diego Simone has done his best to convince his players a comeback is possible. ‘We have to live every minute as if it were the last,’ he said. He is expected to give Fernando Torres another chance to work his cup magic. Suarez, Messi and Brazilian star Neymar are all set to start against the league champions . Spanish newspapers 'as' and 'Sport' preview the game, which they say 'is a final' Fernando Torres played in the first leg and is also due to be handed a start on Wednesday evening . 'It was two goals from the former Liverpool and Chelsea striker that saw Atletico past Real Madrid in the last round. The man who replaced him at Liverpool, Suarez, will be partnered by Neymar who has 19 goals already this season – four more than in the entire 2013-14 campaign. And Lionel Messi completes Barcelona’s formidable front three. The Argentine has scored 22 goals against Atletico in 24 matches. He has scored in his last five games and the team has scored 14 goals in their last three away games. For an Atletico side who will also be without midfielder Koke, a comeback looks a tall order but Simone’s champions are never more dangerous than when they have been ruled out of contention – Enrique has done his best all week to make sure that has not happened.

"PATENTLY A WIN FOR RODGERS . Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho usually looks sharp in a suit on the touchline but he has a different look for cup competitions and prefers to wear his tracksuit. Last night was no different. Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers took it in the style stakes, wearing patent shoes with his suit and that new scarf of his tied neatly around his neck. Rodgers 1, Mourinho 0. Brendan Rodgers and Jose Mourinho chat before kick-off in contrasting choices of outfits at Stamford Bridge . STEVIE HOUNDED FOR SLIP . You would like to think that Steven Gerrard’s long farewell to English football would be respected by opposition supporters. Not a bit of it — and certainly not at Stamford Bridge on Tuesday night. Instead, with every touch of the ball, the Liverpool captain was treated to the ‘Demba Ba’ chant, a reference to last season’s slip at Anfield. Ouch. Liverpool's Steven Gerrard endured a frustrating evening at Stamford Bridge as his side lost in extra-time . SALAH AND SCHURRLE ABSENT . No sign of Mohammed Salah or Andre Schurrle in the 18 for Chelsea, which did nothing to change the feeling that they occupy Jose’s ejector seats, the first to make way should the club crack a deal to sign Juan Cuadrado or Douglas Costa this month. There was a place on the bench, however, for Nathan Ake, as cover in defensive midfield with John Obi Mikel suffering from the head injury which forced him off against Bradford. Andre Schurrle (centre), pictured in training on Friday, is closing in on a move away from Stamford Bridge . STURRIDGE GOES HOME ALONE . Daniel Sturridge, who travelled to the capital with the Liverpool squad, returned north before kick off.

"Misfiring Manchester United striker Robin van Persie has admitted he faces an uncertain future – an eye-catching confession from a 31-year-old who scored the most famous goal of his career in 2014 but begins 2015 with growing doubts over his form and fitness. The facts are these: Van Persie has 18 months left on his contract at Old Trafford and has not been asked to hold any discussions about a new one. He is scoring a goal every 206.9 minutes in the Premier League this season, compared to 120.1 minutes when he won the league for Sir Alex Ferguson in 2013 after a controversial move from Arsenal. What happens next for RVP will be fascinating. To help him along, we lay down the five vastly-differing potential scenarios. Robin van Persie, in action for Manchester United against Cambridge, may not extend his Old Trafford deal . Van Persie has struggled - even though 2014 was the year of the most famous goal of his career . 1: RVP CATCHES FIRE AGAIN AND UNITED GIVE HIM A NEW DEAL . The statistics suggest the best is behind Robin van Persie. Eight goals in 20 league games this season would satisfy some strikers, but not a player who scored 44 goals in all competitions for club and country in 2011-12 and followed up with 26 Premier League goals when United won the title two seasons ago. And yet, Van Persie is a player you'd be foolish to write off completely. We have been here before, at Arsenal he suffered 27 injuries in eight years – many connected with his problematic knee – and was written off as a very top player until he hit a purple patch of consistency from the early months of 2011 and never looked back. Sir Alex Ferguson broke his lifetime's rule of not signing older players to pay Arsenal £24million for a striker pushing towards 30 and RVP paid him back with goal after goal. The Holland international could easily rediscover his form in the red of Manchester United this season . Van Persie had become an almost overnight hit in Manchester after the controversial move from Arsenal . Louis van Gaal, his former Holland coach, has praised van Persie's intelligence and ability to create space for team-mates which is important in a squad packed with so many attacking stars. The goals are the one thing missing from his game but if RVP can rediscover his scoring touch – and his match-winning double at Southampton six weeks ago suggests he still has the knack – United may be persuaded to the negotiating table with an offer that maintains his £200,000-a-week pay packet. Remember, it wouldn't cost them a transfer fee, and buying the next Van Persie would be very expensive. 2: RVP AND UNITED AGREE TO RUN HIS CONTRACT DOWN AND HE MOVES ON . The smart money is on this scenario happening. Van Persie will be just a couple of months off turning 33 when his current contract comes to an end in June 2016 and with United seemingly committed to finding the next batch of Galacticos, it is hard to see how an ageing centre forward with a strong sense of self-worth will fit in. At the same time, Van Persie offers enough to make him worth keeping for the duration of his current deal. He has shown himself comfortable on the big stage at United and he has the versatility of playing as No 9 or No 10 to play with Wayne Rooney, Falcao or James Wilson. Sir Alex Ferguson signed Van Persie from the Gunners back in the summer of 2012 . Van Persie had become disenchanted at the Emirates Stadium and could face a similar conclusion at United . He is getting more injuries – ankle and knee problems this season have caused him to miss matches – and the evidence of your own eyes would suggest he isn't as mobile as the Van Persie of old. But his spectacular diving header for Holland against Spain at the World Cup last summer indicates he is still capable of producing magic few can replicate, which is why United won't ideally be in a hurry to terminate his deal early. Van Persie on a Bosman in 18 months would be attractive to a number of Champions League clubs and affordable to Dutch clubs if he wanted to return home. 3: VAN GAAL GETS FRUSTRATED AND DECIDES RVP SHOULD LEAVE IN THE SUMMER . Van Gaal has a lot of jigsaw pieces to fit in at Old Trafford. When he arrived in the summer, it was assumed his compatriot Van Persie would be top dog and possibly even the club's new captain, but that hasn't happened. Wayne Rooney has been chosen as the team's leader and it's lucky for RVP that Falcao hasn't hit the ground running in English football, otherwise his first-team place might have been in more jeopardy. So far, the United manager has tried all kind of mind games to get the best out of Van Persie, praising him some weeks, then demanding more. But if Van Gaal wants to buy Falcao on a permanent basis – the Colombian did miss the second half of last season through injury and so should improve over the next few months – cuts may need to be made elsewhere. Louis van Gaal has always been a fan of Van Persie but could grow impatient with the striker . Van Persie is one of the big earners and if United want to splash out on the likes of Mats Hummels and maybe even Gareth Bale, even they can't afford to pay everyone £10m a year. Van Gaal has often said he treats players on their performances, not reputation, and took off Van Persie during matches at the World Cup. RVP has scored only once in his last six games, and missed a good chance against League Two Cambridge in the FA Cup last week. 4: RVP BECOMES FRUSTRATED AND DECIDES HE SHOULD LEAVE IN THE SUMMER . Like a lot of Dutch players, Van Persie intelligent, opinionated and not shy to come forward with what he wants and expects in his career. Even under Sir Alex Ferguson, he was confident enough to say publicly he didn't like team rotation and felt he played better when he played consecutive matches to establish a rhythm in his game. Ferguson was very clever and never left Van Persie out even when he went a few games without scoring. He understood the striker was good enough to be treated as an exception, as he had done years previously with Eric Cantona. Van Persie (pictured at Cambridge on Friday night) could become frustrated and leave Old Trafford . There is no reason why Van Gaal won't give James Wilson (right) an extended run in the first team . The trouble is Van Persie is no longer good enough to be treated differently to anyone else. Besides his slump in goalscoring, he is credited with only two Premier League assists this season. If Falcao improves and Van Gaal wants to give Wilson more of a chance, Van Persie will not be an automatic starter in every game, and that might be something the player finds difficult to handle. In the summer, he will have just a year left on his contract. He managed to extricate himself from Arsenal in similar circumstances. 5: RVP GRACIOUSLY ACCEPTS A DOWNGRADE FROM A-LIST TO B-LIST AND BECOMES A LONG-TERM UNITED CLUB MAN . Manchester United holds a special allure to players. Whereas Steven Gerrard has decided to leave Liverpool rather than accept a pay cut and more infrequent appearances to stay, Ryan Giggs and Gary Neville did exactly that in their later days. Both men understood in their thirties they could no longer be the first names on the team sheet, but they signed contracts that reflected that, because they wanted to stay. Van Persie could accept a downgrade to a B-list player and sit on the substitutes bench under Van Gaal . Liverpool's Steven Gerrard has opted for a move to the MLS with LA Galaxy in the summer . Van Persie isn't homegrown of course but there is evidence he and his family have settled in the north west where his children attend school with the offspring of many other United players and other footballers; Wayne Rooney, Phil Jagielka and Fabrice Muamba – whom RVP knew at Arsenal – among them. There is a scenario where RVP will be welcomed to stay at Old Trafford beyond his current deal provided he is happy to be a squad player rather than the main man and maybe be paid £100,000-a-week rather than 200,000. From the club's point of view, to have someone of Van Persie's experience to help guide the younger players would be ideal. Ferguson signed Michael Owen on a free towards the end of his career, Owen didn't play much, but the United manager thought he was fantastic to have around the training ground.","Robin van Persie may not remain a Manchester United player .

"It is nothing new for England cricket captains to struggle against Australia when they take on one of the most demanding jobs in sport. More unusual is having to deal with a blackmail plot over your sex life within a month of taking charge. Such was the alarming and, frankly, bizarre scenario facing Eoin Morgan last week ahead of England’s second defeat against Australia in a one-day triangular series also involving India here ahead of next month’s World Cup. Yet Morgan who, until Thursday kept his private life very much to himself, has emerged from a startling affair that could have derailed his fledgling captaincy with the coolness and calmness that marks his promising leadership style. Eoin Morgan was dismissed for a golden duck in England's three wicket defeat against Australia . Gurinder Sandhu (right) of Australia celebrates removing England one-day captain Morgan . Morgan's desire for privacy was thrown out the window this week amid a blackmail plot against him . On Saturday Brooke Tsakirakis, the woman at the centre of the unlikely scandal to hit the England team, broke her silence to publicly denounce the man who attempted to blackmail Morgan and back the beleaguered skipper. Her words not only appeared to exonerate Morgan of any wrongdoing but would have been greeted with a huge sigh of relief from the ECB, who have spent the last year in turmoil since their Ashes thrashing the last time they came here. ‘I’m gutted and I’m furious,’ was the headline in Saturday’s Tasmania Mercury as it carried an interview with the ‘Hobart mum angry at being an innocent victim of cricket’s blackmail scandal.’ In it Tsakirakis who described herself, colourfully, as ‘ropeable angry’ distanced herself from the actions of her fiancé Nick Emery who demanded £35,000 to stop him revealing intimate details of a liaison between Morgan and Tsakirakis which apparently took place in Tasmania five years ago. Crucially for Morgan and English cricket, she strenuously denied that she has been in contact with the Irishman in recent times, as alleged by her now ex-fiancé, and only had a relationship with him when both were single. ‘I don’t want to air mine and Nick’s dirty laundry but I’m gutted,’ said Tsakirakis. ‘I’m ropeable angry. I’m furious but I don’t think right now that anger towards him is worth wasting my energy on because I have to protect my children. They are my first priority.’ Steven Finn, who has had a difficult past two years, has been in excellent form while in Australia . Morgan chats to bowler Finn before he begins an over against India at The Gabba on Tuesday . The ECB quickly called in Scotland Yard when they were contacted by Emery in Hobart, scene of Friday’s international, last Wednesday and by Thursday he had been tracked down. He was apparently remorseful and regretful and was quick to apologise for his actions. The ECB decided not to press charges but details of the affair emerged on the night before the match. Tsakirakis said the messages relating to her relationship with Morgan were so long ago that she couldn’t remember them. She said it was just two people messaging ‘to and fro’. She believes Emery hacked into a deactivated Facebook account she had at the time she met Morgan. ‘Some of it may have been romantic or sexually explicit but it was nothing more than what any two people who are consenting adults independent of anyone else might say to each other when they fancy each other. ‘What upsets me the most are the reports in the media that Nick has said he had evidence of contact between me and Eoin in the last 12 months. I deny that completely. I have never been in contact with Eoin while I’ve been in a relationship with Nick. Well, Nick and I don’t have a relationship any longer. ‘I feel for Eoin and his partner because we are all innocent parties and I wish everyone well and to move on. I don’t even want to be vindictive about Nick but I’m not going to take responsibility for his actions.’ Morgan was the victim of a blackmail plot but the England captain's reputation has remained intact . England coach Peter Moores backed Morgan for putting up with the blackmail plot over the past week . Morgan has been in a relationship for three years with Australian Tara Ridgeway and she is said to be fully backing him over the scandal. He looked a distracted figure when he took to the Bellerive Oval on Friday and was dismissed first ball but had regained his usual composure after England’s narrow defeat. ‘It hasn’t been distracting at all,’ insisted Morgan. ‘I spoke to the ECB yesterday and I was very happy for them to deal with it. They just told me to focus on my cricket a hundred per cent and I’ve done that. ‘I was very comfortable with the ECB dealing with it,’ added Morgan. ‘I’m happy it’s all been cleared, everything is over and I’ve managed to get on with my cricket as I did today. It wasn’t easy when I came in. The ball was reverse swinging. I nicked one. It happens.’ And on Saturday Morgan was backed by England coach Peter Moores, who feels the Irishman has made an outstanding start to his one-day captaincy and has cleared this little unexpected hurdle in his path with ease. ‘He kept it out of the way of the cricket and away from the lads and moved on,’ said Moores of Morgan’s personal problem. ‘That’s what we want to do at the moment and Eoin got on with it yesterday. I think Eoin goes in with his eyes wide open with the England captaincy. It’s a high profile job, it’s a tough job, but also a very rewarding one. Former England cricketer Andrew Flintoff (centre) speaks with England captain Morgan and Moores (right) ‘I think he’s done really well. He’s kept the captaincy simple which is important and I also think he’s got the right level of having his own view and listening to others and being measured and making sure the players in the side have got a way of talking and shaping the way we go. We want the players to have a voice. It feels a calm dressing room and very committed as it should be. I think he can be well pleased. ‘He has an ability to handle pressure – getting a hundred in the first game at the SCG showed his ability to deliver when it’s tough. That’s something that will stand him in good stead going forward as a captain because over the next two months there are going to be some tough games. ‘I’d say since he’s been captain he’s seemed more relaxed. It’s early days, yes, but he seems happy around the lads and they seem very happy around him and you need that openness in the team. But you also need some direct leadership when a call needs to be made and he’s prepared to make them.’ Morgan has always prided himself on being a detached figure who remains something of a mystery even to Middlesex team-mates who are not even sure where he lives. Well, the events of this week have punctured that desire for privacy and he has had a rude awakening as to what the England captaincy can entail. To the relief of all involved he has emerged with his reputation pretty much intact. It's been a difficult and testing week for Morgan in Australia but the England captain has not been derailed .","Eoin Morgan has been in the headlines this week after a blackmail plot .

Mourinho added of the penalty claim: 'If I speak, people will say it's Mourinho again. If I speak the FA will try to punish me as they always do so I think it is better for you to do it, but it's so clear, so clear, and that is difficult to accept, even winning the game, so I have to ask myself why.'

"Avram Grant admits he jumped into the deep end taking over Ghana just before the Africa Cup of Nations but after almost a month with his new players reckons he is getting on swimmingly. The former Chelsea manager saw his team through to the quarter-finals in Equatorial Guinea on Tuesday after a storming come-from-behind win against South Africa in their final group match in Mongomo, where a double substitution midway through the second half was followed by two goals in 10 minutes. 'Having to learn every day about my team has not been easy but I think I now know enough about all of them,' he said after the 2-1 victory ensured top spot in Group C and a quarter-final in Malabo on Sunday.

'The Nations Cup is nothing new to me. I've been watching it all my life. Obviously being here is a little different to what I've done before but I did a lot of research and preparation. 'We had a good training camp and I've had a chance to also see how the players react after losing and after wining. You saw how we bounced back after we lost our first match.' Grant was under immediate pressure from a skeptical media and public after Ghana let a lead slip and lost to a last-gasp goal against Senegal in their opening group game. But they beat Algeria and South Africa to advance.

'The game was in our hands. I'm very happy for the players, they showed once again as they did in the previous game their spirit and the determination.

"Harry Redknapp believes someone at QPR is trying to get him the sack by leaking stories to the media. Redknapp is the bookmakers favourite to be the next Premier League manager to lose his job and one newspaper claimed this week that lose to Manchester United on Saturday and he would be sacked. And the QPR boss claimed 'somebody is trying to cause me a problem here, by talking to the papers'. QPR manager Harry Redknapp says people at the club are trying to get him out . The former Tottenham boss believes he retains the full support of QPR owner Tony Fernandes, but admitted he suspects challenges to his stewardship elsewhere behind the scenes. Redknapp believes a win over Manchester United at Loftus Road on Saturday would wipe out any talk of him leaving the club. 'Somebody is trying to cause me a problem here, by talking to the papers,' said Redknapp. 'I know what the score is: I'm not silly, I'm very streetwise. Someone's trying to cause me a problem I'm sure. 'I wasn't born yesterday. Someone has said something, but it's not a problem. 'I've never had it before, I've never been at a club before where someone has said I'm going to get the sack. And I don't see why, who puts it in the paper? Someone's put it in the paper. Redknapp says he has a good relationship with chairman Tony Fernandes . 'If I win tomorrow it's all forgotten. I'm not silly. There's always someone trying to put the spoke in. 'They should check everyone's mobile phones and find out. That's the best way, it's easy.' Redknapp is determined to drag QPR to Premier League safety despite the club sitting 19th in the table. The 67-year-old ex-West Ham boss admitted, however, he cannot guarantee he will remain in management next season. 'I'm not sure yet,' said Redknapp when asked if he would continue next campaign, even if not at QPR. QPR players Leroy Fer, Charlie Austin, Matt Phillips and Junior Hoilett train ahead of the United clash . 'When I get fed up with it I'll wake up one morning and say 'I've had enough' but I'm not sure when that will be. It could be any time. 'I've been through lots of bad situations, far worse than facing Man Utd tomorrow. 'It's up to the chairman, whatever he wants to do. I love Tony Fernandes and I don't say that because I'm creeping up to him, it's because he's a great guy. And if he says to me 'Harry, I'm going to go down a different route', fine, that's his choice, what can I do? Redknapp speaks to his players during training ahead of Saturday's game with Manchester United . 'You do your best, that's all you do. If someone goes out, falls over the ball and concedes a goal, what can I do? You can only try your best and I've had a great time, and I want to continue doing it. 'I spoke to Tony this week, he's not mentioned anything of that nature to me, and until he does, I'll keep doing what I do. 'It's up to other people at the club.

"Sheffield United will enter the second leg of their Capital One Cup semi-final hoping to add Tottenham Hotspur to their lengthening list of Premier League scalps in knockout competition. Since manager Nigel Clough took over in October 2013, the Blades have developed a reputation as Cup fighters and have already beaten Aston Villa, Fulham, West Ham, Southampton and QPR in the last 12 months or so. In order to eliminate Spurs and claim their place in the final at Wembley, United will have to overturn a 1-0 first leg deficit. But, given their track record, you wouldn't bet against them causing yet another upset in front of a raucous Bramall Lane crowd on Wednesday night. We take a look back at the occasions when Clough's underdogs have sent the big boys packing. Sheffield United are hoping to cause another upset at Bramall Lane and advance to the Capital One Cup final . Nigel Clough has transformed his Sheffield United side into Cup giant-killers with a number of scalps . A penalty from Andros Townsend handed Tottenham a slender advantage in the first leg of the semi-final . ASTON VILLA 1 SHEFFIELD UNITED 2 . FA Cup third round; January 4, 2014 . Villa manager Paul Lambert had been outspoken before this third round tie that the FA Cup was an unwanted distraction. The Blades clearly didn't share the sentiment. They stunned a lethargic home side after 20 minutes when Jamie Murphy's shot took a deflection of Ciaran Clark and deceived goalkeeper Jed Steer. The Premier League hosts levelled with 15 minutes to play when a hopeful long ball ricocheted around the penalty area and Nicklas Helenius fired home. But just as it looked as though Villa were gaining the upper hand, Ryan Flynn cut inside from the right and sent an unstoppable left-footed strike into the top corner to send 6,000 travelling fans into dreamland. Defeated by a Blades side who at that point were a mere point above the relegation zone in League One, it came as little surprise that Villa were booed off. CLICK HERE FOR OUR MATCH REPORT . Jamie Murphy celebrates after firing Sheffield United into the lead at Aston Villa in the FA Cup last season . United's Ryan Flynn blasts home the winning goal against Aston Villa in the FA Cup third round . FULHAM 0 SHEFFIELD UNITED 1 . (after extra time) FA Cup fourth round replay; February 4, 2014 . United's 'reward' for knocking out Villa was another tie with Premier League opposition in relegation-threatened Fulham. After a 1-1 draw at Bramall Lane, in which 10-man United had held out when Hugo Rodallega equalised Chris Porter's first-half opener, it was back to Craven Cottage for the replay. And, after an extremely tedious 120 minutes in pouring rain, the League One side again upset the odds thanks to Shaun Miller's dramatic last-gasp header. With a penalty shoot-out looming, Miller stooped at the back post to flick in Harry Maguire's towering header from a corner and sent 2,500 travelling fans into raptures.

(after extra time, Sheffield United won 5-4 on penalties) Capital One Cup second round; August 26, 2014 . The Blades eventually reached the FA Cup semi-finals, losing 5-3 to Hull at Wembley. But a new season gave Clough's men plenty more opportunity for giant-killing acts. They returned to London to take on West Ham in the second round of the Capital One Cup and once again it was a dramatic night to remember. Diafra Sakho headed the Hammers into the lead five minutes before the break, but Winston Reid diverted a cross into his own net to gift a second-half equaliser. Neither side could claim a winner in extra time and when Enner Valencia's penalty was saved by Mark Howard, Michael Doyle converted to send United through. It was a small but sweet measure of revenge for 2007, when the Blades were relegated from the Premier League, largely thanks to Carlos Tevez's exploits for West Ham. It was later discovered that West Ham broke rules on third-party ownership by signing the Argentina international. CLICK HERE TO READ OUR MATCH REPORT .

SHEFFIELD UNITED 1 SOUTHAMPTON 0 . Capital One Cup quarter-final; December 16, 2014 . After seeing off Leyton Orient and MK Dons, the Blades were drawn at home to Premier League high-flyers Southampton in the last eight. Ronald Koeman's team struggled to get to grips with the Bramall Lane atmosphere and the direct approach of Clough's team and the pressure eventually told. On 63 minutes, Bob Harris drove a free-kick through a wall of Saints players, goalkeeper Fraser Forster fumbled and Marc McNulty poked the ball home. To compound Southampton's misery, Florin Gardos was shown a red card late on. 'It is an incredible night for the club,' said Clough. 'I thought we deserved the victory, we created more chances and the only disappointment was that we should have had another goal.' CLICK HERE TO READ OUR MATCH REPORT .

With a Capital One Cup semi-final with Spurs to look forward to, the Blades turned their attentions to more giant-killing exploits in the FA Cup. Having seen off Crewe and Plymouth, United were drawn away to Queens Park Rangers in the third round at Loftus Road. With Harry Redknapp's team struggling in the Premier League, United sniffed an upset but few could believe the three-goal margin of victory. Marc McNulty scored the opener on 36 minutes, rounding off a swift counter-attack with a close-range finish.

"From world-beating teams to fantastic fans, the Bundesliga has been nothing short of a success story in recent years. Germany have just won the World Cup, Bundesliga champions Bayern Munich look as unstoppable as ever and German football continues to produce some of the best talents in world football. However, according to a report in the Independent, there is an underlying problem in the German top-flight concerning the use of crystal meth. The is a crystal meth problem amongst German football fans, according to Dr Roland Hartel Petri . Although the cheap beer may lead to the majority of the trouble for German authorities up and down the country, crystal meth is reportedly remains a relatively unspoken issue. Speaking about the issues of drug use in Germany, Dr Roland Hartel Petri told German newspaper Welt: 'Alcohol remains the main issue, but crystal meth is far from something which only appears as a one-off. 'The DFL (German Football League) is beginning to accept that.' When giving a lecture about 'drugs in the fan scene' to representatives from German clubs, the Independent also report that Dr Petri has been told by some patients that fans would take crystal meth as an incognito was of entering stadiums under the influence and as a way to increase energy in case of a violent clash between rival fans. Dr Petri has revealed that although alchohol is the main problem, crystal meth is regularly being taken . Although the issue remains relatively unspoken, fans from Bundesliga clubs haven't been scared to use drug reference in banners.

"Goals from Leicester’s Riyad Mahrez and Tottenham’s Nabil Bentaleb put Algeria into the quarter-finals of the Africa Cup of Nations at the expense of Senegal. Ghana’s late flourish in Mongomo, coming from behind to beat South Africa, saw them put Senegal out of the competition, despite starting the day top of the group. Algeria had to settle for second place, but they can be encouraged by a much better performance in their final game, capped by a stunning strike from Bentaleb. The Algeria squad celebrate taking the lead in the AFCON Group C contest against Senegal . The Spurs midfielder lashed in the second goal from outside the box to seal the win nine minutes from time, and send the Algerian fans into ecstasy. It was no less than the Desert Foxes deserved, as they survived the physical Senegalese onslaught far better than either of the other sides had managed so far in this tournament. And, with their long-ball tactics producing next to nothing, Senegal had little else to offer, particularly after Southampton’s Sadio Mane, by far their most creative player, was withdrawn with 25 minutes left to play. Riyad Mahrez of Algeria celebrates his goal against Senegal during their 2015 Africa Cup of Nations clash . At the start of play both sides knew they would be guaranteed a place in the quarter-finals with a win, but either could go out if they lost and the result in Mongomo went against them. The onus was on Algeria, with Senegal only needing a point, and they showed more intensity from the very first minute than they had in either of their first two games. Inside 90 seconds the Desert Foxes should have been ahead, Hila Soudani – playing for the first time in the competition – robbing Serigne Mbodji and setting Valencia’s Sofiane Feghouli through on goal. The winger, however, with all the time in the world, seemed to panic, and failed to take the ball around Senegal keeper Bouna Coundoul. Carl MeMedjani of Algeria vies with Senegal's Southampton star Sadio Mane during the AFCON tie . It set the tone for the game, Senegal’s defence – so solid before this game – surprisingly off the pace, with Soundani a constant nuisance. And they were punished for a lack of concentration on 11 minutes, an innocuous ball over the top from the half-way line leaving the entire back three standing, as Leicester City’s Riyad Mahrez stole in behind. Mahrez, so disappointing in the first game that he was dropped for the second, showed why he had been recalled, controlling nicely before calmly slotting home past Coundoul. Senegal, for the third time in the tournament, had to try and come from behind, and they did pose an attacking threat in flashes, with Mane playing just off Stoke City’s Mame Biram Diouf. Senegal's goalkeeper Bouna Coundoul makes a save during the 2015 Africa Cup of Nations Group C match . Diouf’s pace in behind forced Rais Mbolhi to charge out of the Agleria goal to clear on one occasion, while Mane’s trickery posed a threat. But the finishing Senegalese was lacking, the Saints winger once undone by a bobble on the pitch, and later flashing over after dancing past a couple of defenders. Their best chance came just before half-time, when Papa Kouly Diop played in Stephane Badji as the Algerian defence switched off from a freekick. With time and space inside the box, however, the wing-back took too long to get his shot away, allowing Bentaleb to get across brilliantly and make a crucial block. Even with Senegal pouring men forward in search of an eqaulaiser it was the Algerians who looked more likely to score. They were only denied a second by a brilliant goal-line clearance from Mbodji, after Saphir Taider had fired a shot from the edge of the box, before Mahrez wasted a good chance on the break. But it mattered little, Bentaleb’s stunner securing the win, and progress into the knock-out stages.","Algeria head to the knockout stages as Group C runners-up .

Pires does not think Wenger should leave the Emirates Stadium any time soon, but feels that either his former team-mate or the Real Madrid boss should be among the candidates to replace him when he does. The 41-year-old, who played for Arsenal between 2000 and 2006, told Goal.com, 'Who is the perfect replacement? Thierry Henry? He understands football and Arsenal. I don't know, but I like Carlo Ancelotti. But that's my opinion, it doesn't mean Arsenal need Ancelotti at this time.' Winger Robert Pires played for Arsenal between 2000 and 2006, winning two Premier League titles . Pires has tipped his former team-mate Thierry Henry as a potential candidate to replace Arsene Wenger . He also believes that Real Madrid manager Carlo Ancelotti should be considered for the role . Wenger has been criticised in recent years for failing to adequately strengthen his squad, but is expected to be more active during this transfer window, with Villarreal defender Gabriel Paulista thought to be close to joining The Gunners. And Pires has backed his old manager's ability to sign top players. 'I wouldn't say Arsenal have made any mistakes in the transfer market. If you play for Arsenal, it means you have some quality,' he said. 'To me, Arsenal's best signing is Santi Carzola. Fans love Alexis Sanchez, and so do I; he's quick to adapt to the Premier League - but Cazorla is so important. For the last few months, he's been our best player.' Villareal defender Gabriel Paulista (right) is expected to complete a move to Arsenal later this month . Pires believes that Santi Carzola has been Arsene Wenger's most important signing in recent years . When asked if fellow Frenchman Alexandre Lacazette, who has scored 24 goals in 28 appearances for Lyon this season, could join Arsenal, Pires said: 'Why not? His characteristics and style of play will suit Arsenal.' Pires is currently playing his football with Indian Super League side FC Goa.

"Liverpool striker Daniel Sturridge will not make his return to action in Tuesday's Capital One Cup semi-final against Chelsea. The striker, who has been out injured for nearly five months with thigh and calf problems, travelled with the rest of the Reds squad to London after returning to first-team training this month. But despite posting a photo to Instagram which suggested otherwise, Sturridge was not deemed fit enough for a place on Liverpool's bench.

"England arrived in the most isolated city in the world on Saturday to find a familiar face waiting and ready to put on a show for them in front of a sell-out WACA crowd. Kevin Pietersen has been like Banquo’s ghost at England’s feast ever since they sacked him and on Sunday he will have the perfect opportunity to show them what they are missing when he plays in the Big Bash semi-final. A number of England players are expected to watch Pietersen’s Melbourne Stars take on a Perth Scorchers side including Michael Carberry in a last-four contest in the massively successful Australian Twenty20 competition. Kevin Pietersen is enjoying his cricket as he plays for Melbourne Stars in Australia's Big Bash competition . Pietersen is gearing up for a Big Bash semi-final match against Perth Scorchers on Sunday . A delicious irony has brought the man who has haunted England’s progress all year to Perth at the same time as his former team-mates, who will face India here in a Tri-series match on Friday which they need to win to make Sunday’s final. Pietersen has made a big impact in the Big Bash — causing problems for England along the way by saying that Eoin Morgan would love him in his side — and has charmed an Australian audience who, without the benefit of the full facts, find it hard to see how England can ignore such an extravagant talent. A relaxed Pietersen talked on Saturday of his enthusiasm for an Australian franchise competition that has shown the way forward for an English Twenty20 game that has been left lagging behind. ‘I’ve absolutely loved it,’ said Pietersen of his time in Melbourne. ‘What I’ve loved is how competitive the cricket is, which is what I’m sure you expect when you come to Australia. Pietersen criticised the reduced salary cap in English cricket, saying they are lagging behind Australia . Pietersen will be watched by some of his former England colleagues when he plays on Sunday . ‘The way the tournament is run, the time between the games, living in Melbourne playing for a brilliant franchise and just having such a good bunch of guys. The coach and management have been sensational and everybody has been treated exactly the same. We’ve had just the best time.’ There was clearly a message to England in there somewhere. As there was, too, when Pietersen was asked if England could learn from the Big Bash, which on Saturday saw a crowd in excess of 52,000 at the Adelaide Oval for Sydney’s semi-final victory over the home side. ‘I think so,’ said Pietersen, without a county in England since his release by Surrey. ‘They can learn because the franchise system does work. Everybody has made it work. I think playing once a week doesn’t work in the UK , especially if you want to get good players in the teams. I tried it last year and found it very hard playing once a week.’ Pietersen struggled for form in the wake of his exile from England for both Surrey and Delhi in the Indian Premier League but he has been much more like his old self in scoring three half centuries for Melbourne. Pietersen, playing for Melbourne Stars, bats during the Big Bash League against Sydney Thunder . Pietersen (right) puts his arm around Peter Handscomb as they leave the field of play on January 17 . ‘When you play more you can practise more and be part of a team environment. And your eyes are consistently picking length. With batting it makes a huge difference. And my knee — my knee was horrendous for the last 18 months.’ Pietersen now has to decide whether he wants to be anything more than a Twenty20 mercenary. ‘I need to seriously figure out what I’m going to do,’ he admitted. But whether he has a future in an English county system where the salary cap has just been reduced remains to be seen. Pietersen does not approve of the cost-cutting measures that emerged last week. ‘What’s frustrating is they say they want to help home-grown players,’ he said ‘But the best way to make them become better is to play against better players. Find a way to franchise county cricket. You would have 10 counties or franchises who play each other in Twenty20 or one-day cricket. The former England man admits that he needs to decide what he is going to do with his career . Pietersen says English cricket need to find a way to franchise county cricket, labelling players 'muppets' ‘All the muppets who are on £18 grand, £15 grand, either you become better or you go and do something else. The best players would play against each other week in week out. That’s how you become better. You don’t do that by reducing salary caps.’ Perhaps not surprisingly for a man who no longer plays the ultimate form of the game, Pietersen expressed concerns about the future of Test cricket. ‘The last couple of months have been the first time I’ve started to worry about Test cricket,’ he said after Melbourne’s last practice session ahead of Sunday’s match. ‘Kids have got no interest in Test cricket. Look at how they are filling these stadiums for Big Bash cricket. They are all kids and you speak to them at the end of a game and you say “would you come to a Test match?” And they say “no”! None of the kids want to block. They want to switch-hit, they want to hit over extra cover, they want to slog a six first ball. It’s sad but that’s the way of the world.’","Kevin Pietersen is playing in the Australian Big Bash for Melbourne Stars .

"Perhaps it explained his restless manner on the touchline. Jose Mourinho is not at ease when his defence springs a leak. It doesn't happen often, but it disturbs him when it does. It happened at Tottenham and again at home to Bradford. Add to this, the nerves of an intense tie between two clubs who have grown to share an intense dislike of each other over the last decade. This was snarling Jose on full power, disputing every decision, picking fights, pressurising officials. He was deep into another complaint to fourth official Phil Dowd when Branislav Ivanovic scored in the fourth minute of extra-time. Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho (second left) was more restless than usual on the sideline at Stamford Bridge . Mourinho (right) shares a joke with Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers during the match . Mourinho will be worried about the defensive issues that have began to sneak into his side's performances . He missed the goal. But here was a show for his team, a sign that they would have to scrap and fight for this one. This would not be about making friends with attractive exhibition football. Diego Costa did not need telling twice. Nor did Gary Cahill. After starting 30 games for Chelsea this season, Cahill watched from a seat behind the manic figure of his manager. This attitude underpinned five major trophies during Mourinho's first spell at Stamford Bridge and he turned it up in pursuit of the first silverware of his second spell. Having conceded 20 goals in the first five months of the season – including three in a quite bizarre win at Everton back in August – Chelsea let in 10 in the first six games of 2015. There were five at Tottenham, four against Bradford and there might have been more than one at Anfield last week. Cahill was there for them all; something of a common denominator, you might say. And last night he paid the price. After starting 30 games for Chelsea this season, Gary Cahill was dropped for Kurt Zouma (left) Mourinho brought in Zouma to counter the pace and mobility of Liverpool forward Raheem Sterling (left) Having been one of the successes of Mourinho's first season back at the Bridge, he was axed as the manager tried to add pace and mobility to his back-four, a specific reaction to Raheem Sterling at centre-forward. Filipe Luis ahead of Cesar Azpilicueta was a similar concession to Liverpool's style and strengths. Defensive solidity has always been a trademark of Mourinho's Chelsea teams, but there have been tiny cracks appearing. Last week at Anfield, Sterling unsettled his team; too quick and mobile for Cahill on the equaliser. There were other situations, too, which might have led to goals. Chelsea escaped with the tie level but one of Mourinho knew he has always been a coach with the ability to notice a problem and react. Out went Cahill. It may only be a temporary issue at this point but it will reverberate within the England camp, where the Chelsea centre-half has been earmarked as one of Roy Hodgson's on-field leaders, and vice-captain. Moreover, there is not a great wealth of alternatives. Filipe Luis (right) was also promoted ahead of Cesar Azpilicueta by Mourinho to nullify Liverpool's pace . Hodgson will watch with interest to see if this is the start of Zouma easing past Cahill in the pecking order at Stamford Bridge. Or perhaps a sign that the Chelsea boss will target a long-term central defensive upgrade in the transfer market. Zouma certainly did not give the impression of a finished article on only his tenth start for the club he joined in the summer. He signed a year ago from St Etienne but completed the season in France. At the age of 20, this was a big test of temperament as much as ability. John Terry gave him an extra-long pre-kick-off man-hug and a word of advice. Zouma has all the physical requirements to be a successful centre-half in England. He is enormous, brave and quick across the ground, cutting a figure like a young Sol Campbell. But there was an early error of judgment on half-way, when he was drawn under a high ball and released Sterling with a glancing header. He had the pace to recover as Sterling skipped past Terry on the edge of the penalty box. Steven Gerrard unzipped the Chelsea back-four with pass between Zouma, on the right of the centre-halves, and the right-back, which was Willian at the time, since Ivanovic was elsewhere, still deciding how to divide his attention between wing-back Alberto Moreno and the more advanced threat of Philippe Coutinho. Mourinho missed Ivanovic's goal in extra-time becuase he was complaining to fourth official Phil Dowd . Ivanovic was erratic in the first-half although he would ultimately make amends with his goal. Nemanja Matic was not at his best and Mourinho was upset by the reluctance of his central midfielders to pass the ball forward, quickly on the turnover of possession, and turned his despair to his staff as they often opted to play towards their own goal. Injuries to Cesc Fabregas and Luis Filipe will worry him but the way Liverpool's attacking players troubled Chelsea will also eat away at Mourinho with Manchester City here on Saturday and Paris St Germain waiting in the Champions League. He will enjoy the clean sheet, but it will not fool him. Thibaut Courtois saved well from Moreno who collected the splendid Gerrard pass, as he did when Philippe Coutinho glided past Zouma, on the half-hour. There were still big holes in the Chelsea defensive unit. More clinical finishing by Liverpool and they would have been behind at the break. There may be issues in Chelsea's defence at present, but Thibaut Courtois remains a rock in goal . Courtois was quite immense throughout, and his early saves bought Mourinho time to adjust and stabilise the team. The home team were stronger in the second half, more successful at breaking up Liverpool's rhythm in the midfield and cutting the supply to the fluent forwards. They were helped by the general mood of dissent which simmered on the pitch and off it, where the Chelsea boss picked a fight with Rodgers' sidekick Colin Pascoe and Costa with whoever he was nearest to. Chelsea were not watertight but they protected their clean-sheet with great spirit - and they are going to Wembley with a goal from a defender.","Gary Cahill was dropped by Jose Mourinho for the clash with Liverpool .

"Opta can also provide data on 'long balls', a pass aimed for a pitch position or 2nd ball rather than a specific player. Manchester United have taken the long-ball route even more seriously under Louis van Gaal this season. In stats provided by Opta, it shows that the Old Trafford side have attempted 1,696 long passes after 22 games this term - 358 more at the same stage last season under former boss David Moyes. In fact, only Burnley - who spent around the £8million mark last summer as opposed to United's £150m spree - have attempted more long balls (1,737) in the top flight this season.

Radamel Falcao (left) and Co were unable to find a way through against the League Two side . Van Gaal exchanges words with QPR boss Harry Redknapp, whose side are third in the table for long balls . That comes as a surprising revelation considering Van Gaal has spoken in frustrated terms on various occasions when his team, in his words, have been forced to retreat to a long-ball game against sides who have used that tactic against them. Following United's win against Harry Redknapp's QPR side earlier this month he said: 'In the first half we played like Queens Park Rangers and that's not good. 'You have to play like we usually play with the ball on the floor.' Most recently after the FA Cup stalemate against Cambridge he told MUTV: 'I was very disappointed at half-time because we made the same error against Yeovil Town and Queens Park Rangers. 'We played in the same style of play [as the opposition] and you don't have to do that.'

"Ben Stokes put his World Cup disappointment to one side to help England Lions draw first blood in their unofficial one-day international series with South Africa A. The Durham all-rounder was controversially omitted from the national side's 15-man squad for the showpiece event in Australia and New Zealand, but responded by taking four for 22 in Bloemfontein as the hosts were all out for 172 after being asked to bat first. Stokes then contributed a valuable 31 with the bat before Samit Patel and Liam Plunkett put on an unbroken 39-run stand as the Lions won by four wickets.

Wicketkeeper Jonny Bairstow (left) celebrates with his team-mates as Harry Gurney (right) bowls a delivery . Dane Vilas and David Wiese put on 56 to stage a mini-recovery but the latter was caught behind off Gurney for 18 and the tail folded quickly. Wiese top-scored with 39 but his counter-attacking innings came to an end when he thumped to mid-off off Stokes, who cleaned up last man Marchant de Lange as the hosts were bowled out in 39.3 overs. Jason Roy and Alex Lees made a decent start in reply, putting on 43 for the opening wicket. Dane Vilas (pictured) and David Wiese put on 56 for the hosts but could not prevent a four wicket defeat . But Lees was dismissed for 12 while Lions captain James Vince made a duck as he was caught behind off De Lange, who had Roy lbw to end an entertaining innings of 41 off 44 balls.

"Manchester United will not reduce ticket prices for their FA Cup replay with Cambridge United. The club had faced calls to lower the cost of admission for the match, which will take place next Tuesday and will be televised.

Manchester United were held to a goalless draw with Cambridge United in FA Cup clash at Abbey Stadium . Striker Radamel Falcao (left) saw his troubles in front of goal continue as Cambridge forced a replay . United would no doubt point out that there will be more than 11,500 concessionary tickets available which will mean junior season ticket holders will pay £10 and over 65s will not pay more than £20. As with Premier League matches, reduced rates apply for other groups including under 16s, 16-17 year-olds and over 65s. They have also frozen season ticket prices for the fourth consecutive season.

"The agony etched on Jose Mourinho’s face on Saturday said it all. He gets it. He knows what it means to play a big final at Wembley. He’s done it before — only once, mind you — beating Manchester United in the first FA Cup final at the revamped Wembley back in 2007. So the shock loss to Bradford City really hurt. It wasn’t just the humiliation of losing, at home, to a team two levels below Chelsea. It was the thought of depriving the club and the supporters of a day out at the home of English football. Jose Mourinho has only managed Chelsea in one big final at Wembley, a 1-0 win against Manchester United . Blues were knocked out of the FA Cup by League One side Bradford after a 4-2 defeat on Saturday . The visiting players at Stamford Bridge celebrate after securing an historic victory . That may seem far-fetched given the path travelled by the Special One. Champions League finals, a UEFA Cup final, the San Siro, the Bernabeu — Mourinho knows his way around elite European football. But there’s something intoxicating about Wembley, and he knows it. He’s Portuguese, but with the heart and mindset of an English football fan. So when Chelsea take to the Stamford Bridge pitch on Tuesday night for their finely balanced Capital One Cup semi-final against Liverpool, he knows what’s at stake. ‘This is our only chance to go to Wembley so it is important,’ said Mourinho. ‘To go there should mean a lot to everyone. We need to forget the FA Cup and think of the next one in a different competition — we are one victory from the final.’ Shaking off the embarrassment of losing to Bradford is likely to be an issue if the Blues are to get there. Mourinho will demand a reaction. And, to be fair, his side tend to deliver. Chelsea won both matches following their two other defeats this season, against Newcastle and Tottenham. On Tuesday, however, it will have a different dynamic. Under pressure, against an improving Liverpool side, Mourinho’s side need to build on the 1-1 draw from the first leg. ‘The result against Bradford doesn’t make the Liverpool game bigger, it is a semi-final,’ said Mourinho. A person like myself and a club like Chelsea always respect the cups, respect the meaning of the English cups. Reactions separate teams. There is nothing we can do about the FA Cup now. Mourinho insists that hi players are fully focused on bouncing back against Liverpool on Tuesday night . Nemanja Matic takes the ball past fellow midfielder Cesc Fabregas in a training session at Cobham . Filipe Morais of Bradford celebrates after scoring his team's second goal on Saturday . ‘It stays in our history as a negative point for every one of us. Right now, we have a lot to play for. We have the Liverpool game and after that we have the Premier League and Champions League. We have enough motivation to carry on.’ Captain John Terry added: ‘The fans will want to see a reaction. It was very quiet in the dressing room, not much was said. Having a kick up the backside can do you good. ‘I would certainly hope that what happened against Bradford is a one-off. We can’t dwell on it. The games are coming thick and fast and there are too many big games at this stage of the season. John Terry: 'The fans will want to see a reaction. It was very quiet in the dressing room, not much was said' Eden Hazard and Cesar Azipilicueta compete in training on Monday . Mourinho will be helped by the expected returns of Terry, Nemanja Matic, Diego Costa and Branislav Ivanovic, who were rested on Saturday, while Eden Hazard and Cesc Fabregas — who was on the bench — should also be in the starting XI. Fabregas’s return should ensure extra fluency in Chelsea’s central midfield but there was a time when playing for Mourinho or Chelsea was a prospect the former Arsenal captain wouldn’t even entertain. ‘Three years ago I wouldn’t have imagined working under Mourinho,’ said Fabregas. ‘But life has many turns, and more so in football. We had a big rivalry with Mourinho but I never hated him. Chelsea was the team I wanted to beat the most. I also had a lot of spats with John Terry but in the end, we are people. I’m not driven by hate.’ Cesc Fabregas has admitted that he wouldn't have imagined working under Mourinho three years ago .","Chelsea lost 4-2 to Bradford in the FA Cup fourth round on Saturday .

"Mauricio Pochettino is set to keep faith with Michel Vorm for Tottenham's Capital One Cup semi-final second leg against Sheffield United, despite the goalkeeper's costly error against Leicester City. Spurs travel to Bramall Lane with a 1-0 advantage, but come in on the back of being dumped out of the FA Cup  on Saturday.

He had a good performance. ‘He made two big saves against Leicester. His attitude is fantastic and nothing has changed. In one action he conceded a goal. He made a mistake. Every player can make a mistake, we must give him support and confidence.’ Despite his willingness to rest Lloris, who is arguably the best player in Tottenham’s squad, Pochettino is attaching paramount importance to this competition, saying a first trophy since 2008 would provide a lift for the whole club. Andros Townsend jumps for joy after scoring from the penalty spot to give Tottenham a first-leg lead . Jay McEveley handled the ball inside his own penalty area in the 74th minute to give Tottenham a penalty . He said: ‘This is the most important game because it is the chance to play in a final at Wembley. ‘It is important to have the opportunity to win a cup in March. I think that is very important and would be a very good thing for the club. ‘Now we realise the level of Sheffield United. We have seen other examples in the FA Cup too. We have to be strong in our minds and expect a tough game. It is going to be a difficult game in a good atmosphere and we have to be ready to fight.’ Citing Tottenham’s underwhelming performance in the first leg at White Hart Lane, Pochettino added: ‘We have to improve our game and play more quickly. We played in a very slow tempo. They played deep and we ended up playing the way they wanted us to play. Now we must play quicker and the way we want to play.’ Pochettino described the second leg as the most important game of the season . Townsend stepped up to the spot and coolly converted to put Tottenham ahead with just over 15 minutes to play . Pochetino also insisted his side would be going out to win rather than protect their lead. ‘I think the pressure is the same as it was in the home game,’ he said. ‘We want to get to the final. But after the first leg we need to be careful, though we need to play freely. We need to score. ‘Our fans expect us to arrive in the final at Wembley. But we need to play better than Sheffield, show more energy than Sheffield and try to fight. For me we need to go there thinking it is 0-0. I believe we will need to score. We have to forget about the first leg and show the mentality to win. ‘When I speak about being more aggressive it is in the right way. We need to fight to get on the ball and instil our game.’ Nacer Chadli returned to training on Tuesday following a family bereavement, but Pochettino indicated he was ‘unlikely’ to be involved.","Tottenham play Sheffield United on Wednesday night in the League Cup .

"Lewis Hamilton's relentless courting of the celebrity world has led him to engage Purple PR, a London-based agency that includes music stars Bjork, Beyoncé, Adele, Prince among its clients. Hamilton, 30, split from Simon Fuller's XIX Entertainment towards the end of last year, as exclusively revealed by Sportsmail. While Purple will look after his image - the style of his tweets has already grown more toe-curling ingratiating towards his followers - he is yet to appoint a new manager to negotiate a new contract at Mercedes, the team at which he won the world title last year.

"Sheffield United boss Nigel Clough has no doubt the cup upsets of the last few days will provide inspiration for his side in their Capital One Cup semi-final second leg against Tottenham - but also that Spurs will now be on red alert about the prospect of becoming the latest giant-killing victims. There were some major shocks sprung by lower-league clubs facing Barclays Premier League opposition in the FA Cup fourth round, most notably on Saturday when Sky Bet League One Bradford won 4-2 at Chelsea while Championship outfit Middlesbrough triumphed 2-0 at Manchester City. And Clough, whose League One promotion-chasers go into Wednesday's clash against top-flight Tottenham at Bramall Lane 1-0 down in the tie, said: 'I read some quotes from Bradford players saying the Friday night game, where Cambridge drew 0-0 at home against Manchester United, gave them inspiration and belief, and we are going to try to use the weekend in the same sort of way. Sheffield United trail Tottenham 1-0 after the first leg of their Capital One Cup semi-final . Andros Townsend wheels away after scoring the winning goal at White Hart Lane . Several high profile teams lost to lowly opposition in the FA Cup, including Chelsea's shock exit to Bradford . 'But the other side of it is that I think it all will have put Spurs on high alert - if the first leg didn't already - that if you are not careful, lower-league teams can cause you a problem.' Clough's men are certainly no strangers to causing cup upsets themselves, the Blades having knocked out Premier League sides in Aston Villa and Fulham on their way to last season's FA Cup semi-finals, despatching another in QPR in the third round this term and seeing off two more in West Ham and Southampton during the current League Cup run. And he has every belief those experiences will set United in good stead for Wednesday. 'We have still got quite a few of the lads from the FA Cup run last year, and the other ones are loving it too,' Clough said. 'Every player and supporter is looking forward to Wednesday night.' Clough also feels big clubs have been taking cup competitions too lightly in general. 'I don't think it is even to do with the teams they put out sometimes,' the 48-year-old said. 'I just think with the majority of the lower-league lads being British and having been brought up with cup traditions, it just probably means a little bit more to them. Blades boss Nigel Clough, with Mauricio Pochettino (right), hopes FA Cup upsets will provide inspiration . Diego De Girolamo (left) celebrates scoring the equaliser in United's 1-1 draw with Preston at the weekend . 'That is not anything too demeaning with regard to the foreign lads - I just think when you are brought up with it, it is inevitable that you are going to understand its importance a little bit more.' United are currently eighth in the third tier and still in both the main domestic knockout competitions, and Clough admits extended cup participation can make things tough in terms of sustaining league momentum. But he insists he never wants anything other than victory from a tie - something unquestionably the case on Wednesday when the prize is a Wembley final. 'It is very difficult to maintain a challenge for promotion while you are still in both cups, without a doubt,' said Clough, whose side drew their FA Cup fourth-round tie at Preston 1-1 on Saturday. 'But when you come to these games, you can't say 'it would be better for us to lose today'. We don't want to lose games. 'People suggested we didn't want a replay (against Preston), but we'd take that rather than be out of the competition any day of the week. That is the attitude we have had in all of the cups.' Cambridge United forced a replay at Old Trafford after holding Manchester United to a goalless draw . Premier League champions Man City were dumped out of the FA Cup by Middlesbrough's Patrick Bamford . Tottenham will be looking to bounce back on Wednesday from their FA Cup elimination at the hands of Premier League basement boys Leicester at the weekend, and despite being at home, Clough thinks his players may have an even tougher task on their hands this time than they did in the first leg last week. 'It might be strange - we might have done the easy part, believe it or not,' Clough said. 'Over two legs you get maybe one shot at these teams when they are not quite sure about you, and all the onus, expectation and pressure was on them at White Hart Lane. 'I think they may be a bit more relaxed at Bramall Lane, because they have a one-goal lead and the onus is very much on us now to go and create. 'It will be an unbelievable achievement for the club, as a League One club, to get to the final.'","Sheffield United trail Tottenham 1-0 in their Capital One Cup semi-final .

"Southampton striker Shane Long has reassured fans that his condition is improving after posting a picture from his hospital bed. The 28-year-old was taken off injured after suffering suspected broken ribs during his side's 3-2 defeat by Crystal Palace in the FA Cup on Saturday. Long was taken straight to hospital, but posted a picture online suggesting he was on the road to recovery. Shane Long tweeted from his hospital bed reassuring fans that he was on the road to recovery . He said: 'Thanks for all the tweets guys. Feeling a lot better today and am on the mend. Here's to a speedy recovery.' Saints manager Ronald Koeman travelled to hospital after the defeat to check up on the striker. He said: 'I spoke to the doctor and he thought he will have fractured one or two ribs and that's very painful. 'It's a pity because we don't have that number of players to go with all the injuries that we have. 'I don't know (how long he'll be out for). Normally three, four, five weeks.'

"A breathless Cup tie was over, the underdogs had taken the victory they deserved, and the Palace fans believed they knew precisely where the credit lay. 'Super Alan Pardew!' they sang, time and time again. And as the new manager clapped his hands and took his bow, nobody could deny him the credit. In a few short weeks, Pardew has created a formidable side from a formless rabble, and this latest success was the most dramatic evidence yet. The tie was decided on the balance of five goals in a gloriously bewildering first half. And it was decided in favour of the better equipped, more adventurous football team. So thrilling was the performance, so beguiling the possibilities that Pardew spoke of amended ambitions. He looked at the mass cull of the giants, and he became thoughtful. 'I want to stay in the Premier League, so the Cup wasn't high on my priority list', he said. 'But when you get in the last 16, things change'. Such a performance can provoke those kind of dreams. For Palace were genuinely impressive, the sheer pace of Marouane Chamakh and Yaya Sanogo constantly disrupting a strangely fallible Southampton defence and the guile of Wilfried Zaha delivering the kind of performance which Pardew knew was within him.

Manager: Alan Pardew 7.5 . Goals: Chamakh 11, 39, Sanogo 21 . Booked: Chamakh 42 . Referee: Jonathan Moss . Attendance: 31,320 . Ronald Koeman was suitably embarrassed by the frailty of his side. 'They talk about our organisation being one of the strengths of this team. Not today', he said. 'You can't defend like that. It was very poor, very poor'. There was no attempt at excuse, for excuses would have been distinctly difficult to find. For a club which might, with justice, have had their sights set on Wembley, it was a shattering disappointment. That remarkable first half gave us goals beyond reason, with two teams geared to attack, scoring virtually at will against defences which obliged them with space and time and all the mod cons which Premier League teams rarely supply so generously. Palace in particular played with a zest and a freedom which had so recently seemed way beyond their means. But their confidence is tangible, and it was not dented when Southampton opened the scoring in eight minutes with the simplest of goals. A left wing corner from James Ward-Prowse swirled through the defence and Graziano Pelle was allowed the simplest of chances. Palace conducted a brief inquest, shrugged and set about settling the score. Satisfaction arrived within three minutes, when Zaha played in his ally Sanogo. The shot was parried by Fraser Foster and Chamakh devoured the rebound. Chamakh's speed proved far beyond the resources of the Saints defence, and a ball played into the path of Dusan Tadic almost brought Palace the lead they deserved. Yet in 16 minutes, they were behind once more, as Ryan Bertrand crossed low and fierce to the near post and Scott Dann's plunge diverted the ball into his own net. On such a day, and in such a mood, it was no more than a temporary hitch. And it was avenged inside four minutes when, from a long clearance, Zaha picked out Sanogo, the home defence once again declined to do its job, and the striker accepted the simplest of driven goals. Four in the first 20 minutes: the neutrals were delighted, the home fans disturbed. For a side which has spent its season scrapping for survival was tearing them apart with acute pace and intelligent movement. In 38 minutes, that side took the lead, as they had long threatened. It was Zaha again, discovering the space, sensing the danger points and creating the chance from which Chamakh scored emphatically. St Mary's grew thoughtful. They are not used to being treated in this fashion with the team Koeman has created.

At half time, Florian Gardos was removed from the fray as the nominated scapegoat – 'I wasn't happy about his performance today', said Koeman. In truth, he could have removed any number of suspects in midfield and defence, such was their ineffectiveness. But the improvement their fans demanded was pitifully slow to arrive. Palace looked organised, their tactics uncomplicated. On the days when their assurance is instinctive and their passing flows, Southampton can be as accomplished as almost any side in England. But, as Koeman said, this was not such a day. Their approach was overly complicated, their chances were rare. And their luck was running perilously low; having brought on Shane Long for Jack Cork in 59 minutes, they lost Long to suspected broken ribs after a clash with Joel Ward 13 minutes later. Yet still they might have salvaged their cause in the 88th minute, when a corner was shuffled to Eljero Elia on the fringe of the area. He drive was struck with vicious intent, but Wayne Hennessey's flying save was a small miracle of agility. The chance was lost, and so was Southampton's Cup tie. Fraser Forster (right) dives to his left but cannot stop Chamakh's shot squirming underneath him to put Palace 3-2 ahead .

"Arjen Robben scored twice on his 31st birthday as Bayern Munich returned to home soil for their first match in Germany since their Bundesliga winter break. Pep Guardiola's side have only played one match since mid-December - a friendly in Saudi Arabia - and they ran out 5-1 winners at second-division side Bochum, ahead of the second-half of their league season kicking off at Wolfsburg next weekend. It did not start as planned for the German champions, when their lowly opponents - who could, though, boast Mikael Forssell among their substitutes - scored through Danny Latza in the fifth minute.

Mario Gotze made it 3-1, before Robben grabbed his second and Bayern's fourth 12 minutes from time.

"Tottenham playmaker Erik Lamela believes he is close to rediscovering the form that led Spurs to sign him for a club record fee of £30 million from Roma in 2013. A mix of injuries, squad rotation and a struggle to adapt to the English style of play has meant that Spurs fans are yet to see much of a return on their investment. But now, after a glittering display in his last appearance against Leicester in the FA Cup fourth round, the 22-year-old feels he is ready to start making good on his price tag.

'I think I'm getting used to English football and I think I have improved a lot, but I can still give a lot more. I can score many more goals, too, because I'm not doing that as much as I did earlier in my career. 'I'm starting to show something of what I can do. I'm training very hard to reach that level and I'm working hard to achieve that every day. I'm very happy playing wide on the right of the attack, which I feel is my best position.'

"In what has been a weekend featuring many surprise results in the FA Cup fourth round, there is little doubt that Bradford’s win at Chelsea is by far the stand-out upset. The Bantams’ stunning performance to come from 2-0 and win 4-2 at the Premier League leaders is sure to be remembered for years to come, but where does it stack against the all-time biggest shocks? Sportsmail looks back on ten of the biggest upsets in the history of the FA Cup, but has the League One side’s fourth round heroics bettered them all? The Bradford squad celebrate their famous FA Cup fourth round win at Stamford Bridge on Saturday . 10) Norwich City 0-1 Luton Town (2013) The booming success of the Premier League since its inception in 1992 has led to the gaps between the top flight and lower league teams increasing – financially at the very least. But Luton Town proved that money is not a certainty to success as they became the first ever non-league club to defeat a Premier League side when they sent Norwich packing in the fourth round. They didn’t even need a bobbly pitch to do it on as well, with Scott Rendell’s 80th minute strike enough to stun everyone watching inside Carrow Road.

The Blues turned up at Brisbane Road with stars such as David Webb, Ron Harris, Peter Osgood and Peter Bonetti – with Webb and Osgood opening the scoring. But Orient fought back and before half-time Phil Hoadley lashed home from 25 yards to make it 2-1. Mickey Bullock equalised to start a mini-pitch invasion before Barrie Fairbrother took advantage of a defensive mix-up late on to seal a famous fifth round win.

Roberto Mancini was expected to deliver a consolation prize in the Cup having seen his Manchester City team stumble behind Manchester United in the race for the Premier League title. But Wigan had other ideas as Ben Watson pounced to score a stoppage-time header and win the Latics their first ever major piece of silverware. Three days later, Wigan lost 4-1 at Arsenal and became the first team to win the FA Cup and be relegated in the same season.

Coventry had performed an upset of their own two years previously by beating Tottenham to win the 1987 FA Cup, but the boot was soon on the other foot when Tony Rains fired Sutton in front before half-time in a third-round tie. David Phillips equalised for the Sky Blues after the restart but Matthew Hanlan helped restore the lead before the hour mark as the non-league side held on in front of 8,000 fans to seal a famous win.

Hanlon later reflected on his FA Cup third round-winning goal against Coventry when he was 22 years old . 6) Sunderland 1-0 Leeds (1973) Mighty Leeds were huge favourites against Second Division Sunderland but one of the great defensive and goalkeeping displays helped serve up one of the most memorable finals – even for a 1-0. Ian Porterfield’s first half strike put Sunderland ahead, and Leeds responded by throwing just about everything at goalkeeper Jim Montgomery – whose heroics in the game peaked with an amazing double save. Sunderland held on and manager Bob Stokoe’s famous run on to the pitch at the full time whistle has been turned into a statue outside the Stadium of Light.

This time it was lowly Colchester who provided the drama. There are stories of the minnows sending an injured player north to watch Leeds train in the week leading up to the match, of them putting in extra seats close to the pitch to pile the pressure on their mighty first division opponents. This was a proper Cup upset. Ray Crawford scored twice before Dave Simmons put Colchester 3-0 up. Something stirred in Leeds and they fought back to 3-2, but fourth division Colchester held on for a famous victory. Colchester's Ray Crawford is grabbed by the home crowd after scoring the goal to complete their giant-killing .

Top guns Liverpool were huge favourites against their First Division rivals in the final, but could do nothing to prevent Lawrie Sanchez heading the Dons in front. Normal order looked set to be resumed when they won a second-half penalty but Wimbledon keeper Dave Beasant became the first keeper to save a spot-kick in a Cup final when he kept out John Aldridge’s 12-yard effort.

Dave Beasant becomes the first goalkeeper to save a penalty in an FA Cup final, from John Aldridge . 3) Bournemouth 2-0 Manchester United (1984) It looked like a straight forward win for Manchester United when they were drawn away to Bournemouth – then of the Third Division – in the third round of the Cup. Ron Atkinson’s team were the holders but didn’t look it as Harry Redknapp’s side battled to a stunning win at Dean Court. Milton Graham and Ian Thompson were the goal scorers. Even Redknapp was left lost for words as he simply declared after the game: ‘We don't get many days like this in Bournemouth.’ Milton Graham cracks United's defence to score Bournemouth's first goal at Dean Court in 1984 . Graham lands and makes his way up off the turf to celebrate his memorable goal in the FA Cup third round . 2) Wrexham 2-1 Arsenal (1992) It should never have been a contest. It was second in the First Division against bottom of the entire Football League. The champions of the country against the lower league minnows. And when Alan Smith fired Arsenal ahead at the Racecourse Ground, the Gunners looked like they were set for an easy afternoon in the third round. But with 10 minutes to go, the ‘magic of the cup’ kicked up something special. The 37-year-old Mickey Thomas fired home a 25-yard free-kick past David Seaman before Steve Watkin popped up to net a late winner and send George Graham’s side crashing out in dramatic circumstances.

The Southern League side had already earned a replay at St James’ Park with a 2-2 draw but looked like they had met their match when Malcolm Macdonald gave the Toon the lead with eight minutes to play at Edgar Street. Radford’s 40-yard screamer three minutes later brought the game level before substitute Rickey George scored in extra time to fire the non-league side into the fourth round in one of the biggest shocks of all-time.

"Host commentator . 'At that age, playing should be the priority,' The former Madrid man told AS. 'It's really difficult in the big clubs among those that can be chosen. 'At 18, I decided to take a step back and sign for a club in the Segunda, but it was there that I got minutes and evolved as a player. 'It's a step that I'd advise all young players to take.' Marcelo Brozovic watches Inter Milan take on Torino ahead of formally completing his move to the Serie A side. Midfielder, who was linked with Liverpool, has signed a new four and a year deal. Bolton goalkeeper Adam Bogdan produced a fabulous display at Anfield and his timing could barely have been better. Liverpool are one of the clubs monitoring Bogdan’s situation aware that he is out of contract at the end of the season and resisting Bolton’s efforts to re-sign. 'It was best for all concerned and at this stage all I wanted was to play for Real Madrid. I've been given a unique opportunity and I want to make the most of it.' Gabriel Paulista waved a tearful goodbye to Villarreal fans on Saturday as he closes in on a £15million move to Arsenal. The Yellow Submarine confirmed on Twitter that a deal with the Gunners had been agreed on Saturday evening, shortly before their Primera Division match against Levante kicked off at El Madrigal. And the 24-year-old said his final farewells to the La Liga side at the half-way point during the 1-0 win, and was visibly emotional as was presented with a yellow submarine as a farewell present. That's according to Italian publication Tuttosport. Why, you ask? The striker, who is still owned by Southamptonm is currently in excile at Inter Milan after clashing with team-mate Mauro Icardi. Laurie Whitwell: Aston Villa defender Chris Herd is set to go on loan to Championship Wigan for the rest of the season. Malky Mackay wants to add the Australian international to his squad and is close to completing a deal. Herd, 25, a Villa academy graduate, has not played for Paul Lambert since December 2013 and his contract expires this summer. He can play right-back, centre-back and in midfield, and spent a short spell on loan at Bolton earlier this season, playing three games. Mackay is struggling at Wigan, winning only one of his 11 games in charge. They lost oat home to Huddersfield on Saturday and are 23rd in the Championship, five points from safety. Juventus may currently enjoy a five-point advantage at the top of Serie A but they're already keen to further bolster their strikeforce for another title assault. According to Sunday's edition of Tuttosport, Juve director general Giuseppe Marotta is weighing up a move for PSG's Edinson Cavani in the summer. The Uruguayan has scored 15 goals in 28 matches this season so far and would certainly be an impressive addition to Juve's front line if they can stump up the cash. Joel Campbell has revealed that he's looking forward to a 'new opportunity' after agreeing to join Villarreal on loan from Arsenal until the end of the season. Despite being called back to the Arsenal squad after an impressive 2014 World Cup campaign with Costa Rica, Campbell has struggled to find a regular spot in Arsene Wenger's first team and has been used in the Frenchman's deal to bring Gabriel Paulista to the Emirates. Speaking via his personal video blog, Campbell said: 'This means a lot to me, I am very excited with this new opportunity and I hope to sign the contract tomorrow [Sunday]. Palermo's president doesn't seem to rate soon-to-be Sampdoria striker Samuel Eto'o. 'I would never have signed Eto’o, as he is a has-been at the end of his career. His arrival is fitting with Ferrero’s day job, as it’s all about cinema and publicity. He also called Paulo Dybala's suitors 'vultures'. 'We are very close to a contract renewal and it’s a matter of days, but the negotiations are being complicated by the vultures circling him. 'Due to this pressure, it will be difficult to keep hold of him at the end of the season. I don’t want to sell my best players, it is they who cannot say no when offered four or five times what they can earn here. Could young PSG defender Marquinhos be off to Manchester United in the summer? His agent is quoted as saying in La Parisien: 'Last summer, the president of PSG declared a transfer for Marquinhos nonnegotiable. We'll see what his position is next summer. Many clubs are interested. Manchester United is one of them, it's true.' Villarreal have confirmed they have agreed a deal in principle with Arsenal for defender Gabriel Paulista to join the Gunners in a £15million deal. The 24-year-old, who Arsene Wenger recently confirmed was a transfer target for the club, is expected to join the club imminently with Joel Campbell joining the La Liga side on loan for the remainder of the season as part of the agreement. Welcome to Sportsmail's live blog of rolling transfer news today. Arsenal look to have wrapped up a deal for Gabriel Paulista, finally signing a defender after months of speculation.

"Former Manchester City manager Joe Royle has backed Manuel Pellegrini's assessment that their late return from Abu Dhabi had little to do with their shock FA Cup exit at the hands of Middlesbrough. The Premier League champions were humbled 2-0 at the Etihad Stadium by the Championship outfit, who progressed thanks to goals from Patrick Bamford and Garcia Kike. City spent the five days prior to Saturday's fourth-round tie at a warm-weather training camp in the United Arab Emirates. A dejected Manuel Pellegrini (right)  reacts next to Middlesbrough manager Aitor Karanka . The team only returned to Manchester on Friday evening and questions were quickly asked about the wisdom of the venture. Manager Pellegrini denied post-match that City's travel arrangements were a factor in the reverse, an opinion shared by Royle, who managed the club between 1998 and 2001. ""I honestly don't think it makes a lot of difference,"" Royle told BBC Radio Five Live's Sportsweek programme. Karanka celebrates with Grant Leadbitter after the FA Cup Fourth Round match victory over City . ""Players will have trained out there and the way players travel, they are hardly put away in steerage at the back, they go first class anywhere. ""I don't think there is any great merit in that, there will be a number of teams that have gone away and won games when they returned. ""It's quite a regular thing, so not too much at all in that."" City return to league action next weekend when they face leaders Chelsea, who were also knocked out of the cup after losing to League one side Bradford at Stamford Bridge, and Royle believes it will be a vital match in their quest to retain the title. Patrick Bamford  celebrates after scoring the opening goal of the game against Manchester City . Garcia Kike of Middlesbrough celebrates with team-mates after scoring his team's second goal . ""I thought that the signing of (Wilfried) Bony would give them a stimulus but he's away at the moment and can't make an impact at all,"" Royle added. ""We don't know how Chelsea will respond. I think (Chelsea boss Jose) Mourinho will be on their case. ""I still think City have the stronger squad, but it is hard to peg back five points now on Chelsea.""

"After the conclusion of Tuesday's Capital one Cup semi-final between Chelsea and Liverpool, the winning manager will have extra cause for celebration. Jose Mourinho and Brendan Rodgers share their birthdays on Monday January 26, and securing a trip to Wembley on March 1 for a shot at claiming the first silverware of the season is sure to be top of their wishlists. Whether the duo will be exchanging cards, though, is not so certain. Former colleagues, Mourinho and Rodgers' relationship has been on the wane since developing a rivalry during last season's title race. Brendan Rodgers (right) worked under Jose Mourinho at Chelsea between 2004 and 2007 . The pair share the same birthday and Mourinho is 10 years older than Rodgers . Mourinho and Rodgers were pictured deep in conversation after the 1-1 draw in the first leg of the semi-final . Brendan Rodger and Mourinho turned 42 and 52 respectively on Monday . Portuguese league title - 2002-03, 2003-04 . UEFA Cup - 2002-03 . Champions League - 2003-04 . Portuguese Cup -  2002-03 . Portuguese Super Cup - 2003-04 . 'When you're fighting for the same competition, the friendship… I have a huge respect for him, wonderful man, coach, but in time you are so engrossed in your own work, you don't communicate as much, you don't have the conversations you had before and ultimately you could be a rival,' Rodgers said before last week's first leg. The Liverpool boss, who turns 42 on Monday and is 10 years the Chelsea manager's junior, was once Mourinho's protegee after working under him during his first spell in charge of Chelsea from 2004 to 2007. In 2013, Rodgers even credited Mourinho for his ascent towards becoming Liverpool manager, admitting that he learned valuable lessons under the Portuguese's guidance during his formative coaching years. Mourinho celebrates during Porto's Champions League semi-final against Manchester united . Rodgers holds up the Championship play-off trophy after guiding Swansea to the Premier League in 2011 . Mourinho joined Chelsea in 2004 after achieving domestic and European success at porto . 'I probably wouldn't be sat here today if it wasn't for him,' Rodgers said. 'He played a huge part in my career.' But the Reds boss has a lot of catching up to do to if he is to emulate his former teacher. The only piece of silverware Rodgers has been able to get his hands on during his six-and-a-half years as a manager is the play-off trophy, and if he is to convince people he is the real deal it is time he won something more meaningful. When Mourinho was Rodgers' age he was six months into his reign at Chelsea and had already won two Portuguese league titles with Porto. And Mourinho had turned heads in Europe, too. In his first full season with the Portuguese giants he led Porto to UEFA Cup success before shocking the football world by winning the 2003-04 Champions League, famously eliminating Manchester United along the way. Mourinho led Porto to shock Champions League success in the 2003-04 season . Mourinho hugs defender Paulo Ferreira as the Porto side celebrate winning the tournament . Mourinho looks on ah his squad lift the Champions League trophy after beating Monaco in the final . There was also a Portuguese Cup and Portuguese Super Cup to add to Mourinho's swelling list of honours. The 52-year-old's rise to the top was as rapid as it was extraordinary. Rodgers, on the other hand, spent four years with Watford, Reading and Swansea before joining a Liverpool side that had finished eighth in 2011-12. And there was little improvement the following season as Rodgers led the Anfield club to seventh in his first season in charge. But Rodgers' search for his first major trophy almost ended last season before Liverpool fell at the last hurdle in the Premier League title race. And it was against his former mentor that Rodgers' house of cards came tumbling down. Rodgers and Mourinho on the touchline during Chelsea's 2-0 win against Liverpool in April . Rodgers spent three season working at Chelsea during Mourinho's first spell in charge . Rodgers and captain Gerrard look dejected after Liverpool were beaten 2-0 by Chelsea in April . The 2-0 defeat by Chelsea back in April allowed Manchester City to usurp Liverpool at the top of the table as Rodgers missed out on bringing a league title to Merseyside. After the game the Northern Irishman was critical of Mourinho's defensive gameplan, claiming Chelsea had 'parked two buses' in front of the Liverpool goal. In truth, Mourinho simply masterminded a costly tactical victory over Rodgers. But despite a difficult start to the 2014-15 campaign, which has left Liverpool languishing in eighth place, Rodgers has another opportunity to win his first trophy. Chelsea go into Tuesday's second leg as favourites after the 1-1 draw at Anfield last week, but there was enough about Liverpool's performance to suggest that Jose Mourinho's side won't have it all their own way at Stamford Bridge. Eden Hazard scored from the spot in the 1-1 draw in the semi-final first leg . Raheem Sterling celebrates after scoring his superb equaliser for the hosts . Beyond the Capital One Cup, Saturday's freak results in the FA Cup will have given Rodgers hope that another shot at Wembley is well within reach. With four of the top six in the Premier League crashing out of the competition, Liverpool automatically became one of the favourites to lift the trophy along with Manchester United and Arsenal. The Reds will have to play a replay at the Macron Stadium, however, after being held to a goalless draw by Bolton in the fourth round. There has been no suggestion that Rodgers is under pressure at Liverpool, and he was backed by the owners in their New Year message to supporters, but another season without a trophy or a top-four finish and he may be feeling heat.","Chelsea and Liverpool meet in the second leg of the League Cup semi-final .

"When Roberto Mancini claimed that most of Manchester City’s success under Manuel Pellegrini was as a result of players he had signed it was easy to dismiss it as sour grapes from the Italian. But did he have a point? The spine of Pellegrini’s side which won the Premier League last season was made up of Mancini’s men and while it should be noted that executive duo Ferran Soriano and Txiki Begiristain have their say in recruitment, the arrivals since Mancini’s departure have hardly lit up the Etihad Stadium. Here, Sportsmail gives the verdict on each of Pellegrini’s acquisitions ahead of Saturday’s title showdown at Chelsea. Manchester City Manager Manuel Pellegrini (left) and Yaya Toure hold the 2014 Premier League trophy . Pellegrini is launched into the air by his City players after their Premier League title triumph last season . Roberto Mancini (left) guided City to the title in 2012, but the Italian was sacked the following season . Fernandinho: £30m - Shakhtar Donetsk . At £30m, the Brazilian midfield enforcer did not come cheap. Brought in to free up Yaya Toure he played a key role in City’s title win last season as his covering presence gave his Ivorian team-mate the freedom to bang in a staggering 20 Premier League goals. VERDICT: HIT . Fernandinho did not come cheap at £30m but the Brazilian has proved a hit since his arrival at the Etihad . Alvaro Negredo: £20m - Sevilla . An instant hit, The Beast plundered a staggering 23 goals before the end of January. But a shoulder injury sparked a loss of form and he failed to hit the back of the net in the remainder of the campaign. After dropping below Edin Dzeko in the pecking order he was loaned to Valencia and may not be seen in the blue of City again. VERDICT: JURY OUT . Alvaro Negredo (right) made a big impression early on at City but he has since been loaned out to Valencia . Jesus Navas: £14.9m - Sevilla . Would appear to be liked more by his manager than the City fans. Navas has made 32 appearances already this season. In his 21 Premier League matches he has provided six assists and often gets into good positions only to be let down by his final ball. VERDICT: MISS . Jesus Navas (right) has made 32 appearances for City this season but his final ball has been disappointing . Martin Demichelis: £4.2m - Atletico Madrid . Struggled to adapt to the Premier League following his switch from Spain and was ridiculed by pundits including the likes of Alan Hansen. Found his feet to strike up a solid partnership with Vincent Kompany despite his advancing years and has remained a key man this year. VERDICT: HIT . Martin Demichelis (right) struggled in his early days but has emerged as a defensive leader in the City side . Fernando: £12m - Porto . The man known as Obama for his likeness to the US president is yet to convince the Etihad electorate. Too often his midfield partnership with Fernandinho has looked lifeless and defensive. Will benefit from the return of Toure and could still prove to be a shrewd bit of business but has done little to show he is better than Javi Garcia, the man he replaced. VERDICT: MISS . Fernando (left) puts in a strong tackle on Middlesbrough's Patrick Bamford at the Etihad on Saturday . Eliaquim Mangala: £40m - Porto . Fighting off competition from Chelsea the capture of the French defender was seen as a coup. Not any more. A series of inconsistent performances have left fans scratching their heads as Mangala struggles to adapt. At £40m the bedding-in process should not be taking this long. VERDICT: MISS . Eliaquim Mangala (left) and Bacary Sagna have both flattered to deceive in defence for City . Bacary Sagna: Free - Arsenal . The right back has struggled to dislodge Pablo Zabaleta and has just six Premier League appearances under his belt. Although a free transfer, City had to offer him a better contract than Arsenal and he would appear to be an expensive understudy. VERDICT: MISS . Willy Caballero had a tough afternoon in goal as City crashed to shock FA Cup defeat by Boro on Saturday . Willy Caballero: £4.4m - Malaga . The Argentina man, a Pellegrini favourite from their time in Spain, was expected to provide real competition for Joe Hart. However, England’s No 1 has not come under great pressure and against Middlesbrough on Saturday in a rare start, Caballero was jittery and at fault for the Championship side’s opener. VERDICT: MISS . Pellegrini’s best bit of business has arguably been the acquisition for former Chelsea stalwart Frank Lampard . Frank Lampard: Free - Chelsea . Probably Pellegrini’s best bit of business, regardless of the questions over his move from Chelsea. Evergreen Frank has scored a number of key goals this season and has often provided a creative spark lacking in City’s midfield. Pellegrini was keen to stop his planned move to New York City FC and for good reason. VERDICT: HIT . Lampard (centre) scored the late equaliser that salvaged a 1-1 draw against old club Chelsea in September . Stevan Jovetic: £22m - Fiorentina . Was dubbed the 'Invisible Man' after he arrived thanks to a number of mystery illnesses and injuries. Has been given an opportunity to shine this season but has only shown glimpses of the talent that made him one of the hottest young properties in Europe. VERDICT: MISS . Stevan Jovetic (left) has only shown shown glimpses of the talent since he signed from Fiorentina .","Manchester City won the Premier League under Manuel Pellegrini last term .

"Liverpool vice-captain Jordan Henderson insists they will not be bullied by Chelsea in a potentially-explosive Capital One Cup semi-final second leg next week. A 1-1 draw at Anfield leaves the tie finely-balanced but there will be a number of sub-plots when the teams take to the field at Stamford Bridge on Tuesday. Jose Mourinho's side have a number of questions to answer after conceding a 2-0 lead to lose 4-2 to League One Bradford in the FA Cup. Jordan Henderson (second right) and Chelsea striker Diego Costa (right) came to blows in the first leg . And Henderson (left) insists Liverpool will be ready for a fiery second leg against Chelsea . Henderson has been tipped to take over as Liverpool captain when Steven Gerrard (centre) leaves . Sportsmail's Martin Samuel believes while Jordan Henderson is much improved from when he joined Liverpool, he is not of the same level as Steven Gerrard. Read his column here. But in addition there will be an edge to the game after Henderson and Chelsea striker Diego Costa had a disagreement on the pitch with more verbal jousting continuing in the tunnel after the whistle. The England midfielder played down the incident but his actions indicate that Liverpool are prepared to stand toe-to-toe with any opponent. In relation to the headlines which followed his confrontation with Costa, Henderson said: 'I was a little bit surprised...but of course I don't know what you are talking about it.' Asked if there would be an edge to the game - in which he could be a target for home fans - Henderson added: 'Probably. Liverpool, Chelsea - two big teams. 'I haven't really thought about it, it doesn't really bother me. The main thing is I go there and do the best for the team. 'You have to be strong mentally and physically and I think we have been that recently. Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers has been pleased with Henderson's leadership qualities . Rodgers could be tempted to bring Daniel Sturridge back into the squad for the game against Chelsea . 'We have shown we can be physical when we need to be but we just have to keep going.' Manager Brendan Rodgers has spoken glowingly of the 24-year-old's growing leadership skills and the player himself feels there is extra onus on him to stand up for his team-mates having been made Steven Gerrard's deputy earlier this season. 'I feel I have to take a bit more responsibility on and off the field to especially help the younger players coming through as I've been through the same sort of thing - but that goes for all the experienced players in the team,' he added. 'There have been some tough times but we have dug in, stuck together as a team and we have come out the other side in the last month or two and been much better so hopefully we can keep going from strength to strength.' Liverpool's scintillating second-half display at home to Chelsea raised expectations they could go to Stamford Bridge and win. There is also the possibility of striker Daniel Sturridge returning to the squad having not played since the end of August. 'Hopefully when Daniel comes back it will give us a cutting edge. He is a big miss for us as he is a fantastic player,' Henderson said. 'Hopefully he comes back and gets the goals straightaway. Raheem Sterling (right) scored Liverpool's goal in the 1-1 draw in the first leg with Chelsea . 'We have a lot of confidence after the first leg and we were a little bit disappointed we didn't win. 'The confidence has grown over the last month or two, we've picked up some really good results and the team spirit has been fantastic so it is a good opportunity for us on Tuesday. 'The game might be a little bit different, they will be coming straight at us from the off and they have some fantastic players but we are a good team so we need to defend like we have been doing and hurt them on the break. 'One of our aims this season is to get a trophy and if we beat Chelsea we are not far away as we will be in a final at Wembley.'","Jordan Henderson expecting a fiery game between Liverpool and Chelsea .

"Atletico Madrid kept pace with their rivals at the top as they brushed aside neighbours Rayo Vallecano 3-1 on Saturday night. Antoine Griezmann scored a brace but somehow missed out on a hat-trick despite a string of second-half chances. Atletico Madrid's Antoine Griezmann scores first goal against Rayo Vallecano on Saturday night . France forward Griezmann cut out a pass by defender Ze Castro and slotted past keeper Tono after 12 minutes. He then latched onto a flick-on from Mario Mandzukic and again produced a precise finish to double Atletico's lead. Rayo pulled a goal back through Roberto Trashorras before the break but Manucho diverted a corner into his own goal 10 minutes after the restart. Griezmann's clinical second set up 3-1 victory for Atletico against Rayo Vallecano . Griezmann was close to his hat-trick late on but his shot from the right of the penalty area came back off the post. Atletico could not afford a slip against a Rayo side who arrived having won five of their 10 away games in the league this season. However the champions found their local rivals in generous form, with Rayo's defence lending a helping hand all night. Real Sociedad's Yuri Berchiche (C front) controls the ball against Eibar on Saturday . Meanwhile, Xabi Prieto's second-half goal ensured Real Sociedad returned to winning ways. Prieto headed home the game's only goal at the Anoeta to see off Basque neighbours Eibar 1-0 and earn David Moyes' side a welcome three points after last weekend's home loss at the hands of Rayo Vallecano.

"Jack Nowell's dad cannot recall when he was most in peril at sea. A 45-year-old Cornish trawlerman whose family have hauled fish out of the often treacherous waters around Newlyn for more than two centuries, Mike Nowell tries to put the risk inherent to his job out of his mind. ‘There’ve been so many hairy moments it’s hard to say which one was worst,’ he said. ‘I knew men who’ve been lost at sea. It’s an awful feeling when you lose someone close to you. As a fisherman you try and put that to the back of your mind. If you thought about it all the time, you wouldn’t do it.’ It would be churlish to compare life as a professional rugby player with the day-to-day threats faced by fishermen, but it’s clear bravery and a willingness to embrace risk has been passed from father to son. Exeter Chiefs wing Jack Nowell  is an ambassador of the Penlee Lifeboat Station in Cornwall . When Stuart Lancaster was asked last week what it was about Jack he admired most, his response was unequivocal. ‘He’s got the fearless courage to be thrown into a Test arena and say “Give me the ball, I want the ball” and make a difference,’ said the England head coach. ‘It’s what he brings to the team. He makes very few errors, has a kicking game, an ability to beat defenders and his defence is very, very good. He brings a no-fear mentality.’ The 21-year-old scored a try in Saturday's 45-3 Challenge Cup victory over Bayonne . The Exeter Chiefs wing hugs England team-mate Danny Care during last year's Six Nations . Lancaster is clearly a huge admirer of the 21-year-old Exeter Chief who, under different circumstances, could easily have followed dad Mike into the family business. ‘I always joked with mum growing up saying “I don’t know what I’m going to do after school, I’m going out fishing with dad”,’ said Jack. ‘She’d say “No, you are not, you’ve got an education to fall back on”. I’d wind her up saying I was going to be a fisherman. ‘I never thought I’d make it as a professional rugby player. All through school I didn’t know what I was going to do. It wasn’t until I got to college that it really hit me that if I put my head down for two years I’d have a contract waiting for me.' Nowell trudges off with England team-mates after the Six Nations clash in Paris against France last February . Exeter Rugby player Jack Nowell onboard a RNLI boat in the Newlyn Harbour in Cornwall with his father . Nowell’s exceptional form this season since returning from an operation on his left knee — which caused him to miss last summer’s tour to New Zealand after patella tendinitis had left him to ‘play on one leg’ for almost five years — saw him named in Lancaster’s 34-man Six Nations training squad. A strong showing in camp over the next fortnight will see him earn his sixth cap on the right wing against Wales in Cardiff in 12 days, when England open the Six Nations.Twelve months after making his debut against France in Paris, and with a home World Cup around the corner, Nowell looks set for another stellar year. But it could all have been so different. Far from the rough, tough, tattooed figure Nowell cuts on the Newlyn harbour jetty as we talk — just yards from the family home he grew up in — the Cornishman admits he took time to embrace the sport he now loves. ‘I hated it to start with,’ he said. ‘I was about six years old when mum first took me along to rugby training but I wouldn’t play. I’d cling on her legs and refuse to go out. There were a lot of tears and tantrums. Jack Nowell in a school photo with his sister and two brothers whilst at the Newlyn School, Cornwall, in 2008 . ‘Eventually, after a couple of months I just went for it and haven’t really looked back. Dad used to bribe me by paying me a quid for every try I scored but he stopped when I scored 12 in one game against Redruth. He said “You can play on your own now, son”.’ A decade later Nowell cut his teeth in one of English rugby’s toughest arenas. ‘I think I was one of the youngest players to play for Redruth’s first team and I learned a lot there,’ he said. ‘I wasn’t happy just getting along so I really went for it. There was a guy called Nathan Pedley who was a well-known Redruth player who’d been there for years and years. He’s a small guy but a hard guy. Jack Nowell poses for the Mail on Sunday onboard a RNLI boat just out from Newlyn Harbour in Cornwall . Jack Nowell (Bottom row, second from the left) celebrates with team mates after winning a game as a junior . ‘In my first training session we were playing touch rugby and he obviously thought “There’s this new kid, I’m going to give him a whack”. I remember I caught the ball and he absolutely smoked me. It was a high, late and tip-tackle all in one. It was known as a Nathan Pedley tackle. ‘I thought “Right, OK, this is men’s rugby” and got up and played on. People took notice of that because I’d just dusted myself down and come back for more.’ Precisely the same mental and physical toughness w as on show on debut in Paris last year, when Nowell’s spilled kick-off led to a try for France winger Yoann Huget inside two minutes. It could have crushed a lesser man but Nowell shrugged off the mistake and set about repairing the damage to finish the match comfortably in credit, despite a narrow defeat that ultimately cost England a first Six Nations championship under Lancaster. Nowell in action for England (left) and back at six-years-old before his first ever rugby match (right) ‘The coaches said the reason I got picked after that was because I didn’t allow that one mistake to affect me,’ said Nowell. The last time England were in Cardiff they suffered a humiliating 30-3 defeat in what was the first serious blow to Lancaster’s reign. When the England coach sits down to pick his team, he’ll be looking for players who embrace the big stage and Nowell has shown time and again — notably in Exeter’s Heineken Cup defeat by Jonny Wilkinson’s star-studded Toulon side last season — that he fears no-one.

Nowell puts on all the right gear for photos as an ambassador of the Penlee Lifeboat Station in Cornwall . Nowell was playing for England Under 20s when Lancaster’s men were mauled in Cardiff but the youngster believes he’s gained enough rugby experience to handle the heat. ‘I was chucked into a Premiership game for Exeter when I was 19 and if I’d gone in being afraid then I might not have got picked again. It was the same in the Six Nations last year but Stuart backed me.’ Whatever happens now, this son of Newlyn will return home to Cornwall with his feet on the ground. As an ambassador of the Penlee Lifeboat Station — who lost eight men on a rescue one grim night in December 1981 — Nowell and his dad have grown up recognising real bravery when they see it.

"England's best-laid plans for the Six Nations were in tatters on Sunday night as Owen Farrell and Kyle Eastmond joined a growing list of casualties in danger of missing the opener against Wales. A weekend of ferocious European club matches has left head coach Stuart Lancaster with concerns about the health of several leading men. Having already been forced to accept the absence of Manu Tuilagi, Ben Morgan, Courtney Lawes and Joe Launchbury, there is a danger that the national team will also be without Tom Wood, Geoff Parling, Farrell and Eastmond in Cardiff on February 6. There was a scare involving England’s first-choice fly-half, George Ford, who went off for concussion tests after suffering a heavy blow during Bath’s victory over Glasgow. He was able to return to action after passing the tests, but his condition is sure to be further assessed by the England medical staff after he reports for Test training today, along with the rest of the Red Rose squad. Owen Farrell suffered a knee injury after falling awkwardly following a tackle from Clermont's Julian Bardy . Bath centre Kyle Eastmond lasted only six minutes against Glasgow after being forced off with a 'stinger' George Ford (left) had to undergo concussion tests after suffering a heavy blow during Bath's win on Sunday . Owen Farrell has not had much luck with injuries this season and has had little playing time as a result. The Saracens fly-half has played 913 minutes in 16 matches for club and country this season (an average of 57.06 minutes per game). The prospects for Farrell, Ford’s rival for the No 10 shirt and likely understudy at the Millennium Stadium, appear grim after he was injured playing against Clermont Auvergne yesterday. He walked off just 15 minutes into the 18-6 defeat, having fallen awkwardly as he was tackled by Julien Bardy. The Saracens’ stand-off looks doubtful for the encounter with Wales after he was seen leaving the Stade Marcel-Michelin on crutches with his left knee in a brace. Asked if the 23-year-old would be fit for the start of the Six Nations, Saracens’ director of rugby Mark McCall said: ‘I wouldn’t want to say right now. It’s a knee injury and we don’t know the extent of it just yet. It’s complicated with knee injuries, but we’ll get him looked after and we’ll know within the next few days.’ Leicester lock Geoff Parling picked up a knee injury against Ulster and will be out for three to four weeks . Saracens lock George Kruis looks set to start alongside Dave Attwood against Wales in Cardiff . The injuries to Ford and Farrell could open the door for Sale’s Danny Cipriani to stake his claim to being more than fourth-choice fly-half. Eastmond was forced off with a sore left shoulder in the sixth minute of Bath’s clash with Glasgow and the West Country club’s director of rugby, Mike Ford, suggested his centre had suffered a ‘stinger’ for the second successive weekend. ‘He came off last weekend with a shoulder (injury) and he took another knock today but it doesn’t look too bad,’ he said. ‘He’ll go for a scan tomorrow.’ Wood, England’s first-choice blindside flanker, hobbled off early in the second half as Northampton were beaten at home by Racing Metro and his director of rugby, Jim Mallinder, said: ‘Tom has twisted his ankle. He was certainly sore and it was sensible to bring him off.’ Northampton blindside Tom Wood limped off with an ankle injury during his side's loss to Racing Metro . Parling — who was seemingly destined to start at lock in Cardiff — suffered a knee injury playing for Leicester in Belfast on Saturday and initial estimates were that he would be out for three or four weeks. His fellow Tiger, Graham Kitchener, is destined to come into the squad while George Kruis of Saracens could start after serving a ban for a dangerous tackle earlier this month. Northampton captain Dylan Hartley, meanwhile, has bemoaned his treatment by officials after he was harshly sin-binned for a technical offence on Saturday, having recently returned from his latest suspension. Saints and England hooker Dylan Hartley watches on at Franklin's Gardens after his sin-binning on Saturday . The England hooker, who has had several disciplinary episodes during his career, said: ‘Just imagine being me. I knew the spotlight would be on me. ‘A player runs over me and I put my arms up and I tackle him. The next thing you know, I’m watching the game. ‘Maybe I am being judged differently but that’s my own doing and I’m the one who has got to deal with it.’","England face Wales in Cardiff on the opening weekend of the Six Nations .

"Lewis Hamilton is adamant there is 'no stress' with regard to signing a new Formula One contract with Mercedes. Mercedes motorsport boss Toto Wolff had suggested prior to Hamilton's title triumph the 30-year-old would again put pen to paper as soon as the off-season commenced. Hamilton, however, has revealed there has been no progress in talks over the past two months as he has 'completely switched off' from F1.

The British driver celebrateD with a kiss from his pop star girlfriend Nicole Scherzinger . Not that Hamilton is concerned despite being in the final year of his initial three-season agreement with Mercedes. 'As soon as I left the last race I was at the factory for a couple of days, but I haven't sat down with the team,' said Hamilton, speaking to Sky Sports F1. 'But we said last year we're not in a rush. We're relaxed. The team have acknowledged they want to continue with me and vice versa, so there is no stress. 'I'm comfortable and confident and trust they're not speaking to anyone else, and they know that's the case with me.' After setting high standards last year with 11 race wins and a second world title, Hamilton admitted he will not be satisfied this year unless he at least emulates such achievements. The reigning champion can expect another tough battle with Mercedes team-mate Rosberg . Hamilton is determined to repeat the success of last year, when he won 11 grands prix . Ahead of the new season that begins with the Australian Grand Prix on March 15, Hamilton added: 'For myself, naturally, and as an athlete I always want to be the best I can be. 'So anything less than what I did last year is not going to be good enough. 'But I can be better. There are going to be 20 races this year, there were eight races that I didn't win (in 2014), so you can always get better. 'I plan to drive the way I drove last year, but hopefully with the knowledge and experience of last year and the growth, with turning 30 and everything. 'Whether it's an inch, a foot, a metre or a mile, I want to try and make sure I'm always moving forward.'","Lewis Hamilton is yet to sign a contract extension with Mercedes .

"It was an afternoon for sharp mathematicians at the Stade Marcel-Michelin as Saracens squeezed through to the Champions Cup quarter-finals despite losing to French heavyweights Clermont Auvergne. Ed Griffiths, CEO of the London club, kept an anxious eye on unfoldings elsewhere as Toulouse’s narrow defeat by Montpellier ultimately booked Saracens a knock-out trip to big-spending Racing Metro. Castres’ decision to field a weakened side in their Pool Two matches created a skewed points difference that almost cost Saracens their hopes of progression as one of the three best runners-up. Owen Farrell of Saracens is hauled down by Julien Bardy of Clermont before being replaced . ‘It is so disappointing to see a club like Castres throw up the white flag,’ said director of rugby Mark McCall. ‘It is meant to be an elite competition and that should not be tolerated. We give a lot of thanks to Montpellier for fronting up against Toulouse.’ It transpired Saracens had a 35-point safety cushion in defeat. That effectively turned the fixture into a shootout for a home tie. Clermont fly-half Camille Lopez kicked the opening points before Owen Farrell missed a chance to level the score. There was concern when the England contender fell awkwardly in the 15th minute and he was replaced by Charlie Hodgson. Farrell walked off unassisted but later left the ground on crutches with his left knee in a brace. Wesley Fofana of Clermont is tackled by Saracens duo Brad Barritt and James Johnston . Hodgson, too, was off target with his opening kick at goal, and that lack of execution was punished by Clermont on the half-hour mark when Nick Abendanon scored. A powerful Saracens set-piece has been their most potent weapon this season and that was the case here. It provided territory for Hodgson to kick a penalty before the break and the fly-half added three more points from the boot later on. Vincent Debaty rumbled over for the decisive Clermont try after Saracens wing David Strettle was sent to the sin bin for a late tackle on man of the match Abendanon.

"Four English clubs have qualified for the quarter-finals of Europe’s premier tournament for the first time since 1997-98 and only the second time in the history of continental competition. However, Saracens, Wasps, Bath and Northampton have all been drawn away in the Champions Cup last eight, with three of the fixtures taking place in France. The line-up is a reflection of the balance of power in Europe, with the big change from recent seasons being the decreased impact of the Irish provinces.

No one will fancy playing us.’ Saracens’ defeat at Clermont yesterday has condemned them to a trip to Paris to face Racing Metro, although Mark McCall and his men will take heart from their opponents’ wild fluctuations in form. However, at their best Racing are formidable, as they emphasised in putting Northampton to the sword at Franklin’s Gardens on Saturday. Saints’ reward for that hammering is a trip to Clermont. Stade Marcel Michelin is arguably the most forbidding arena in European rugby so Jim Mallinder’s side will be clear underdogs.

"Formula One's long-awaited return to South Africa has taken a step closer to coming to fruition. F1 supremo Bernie Ecclestone confirmed last month he was 'in the middle of trying to do something in South Africa', with the race last on the calendar in 1993.

Anthony Hamilton (left),  with son Lewis, has been working on bringing a Grand Prix to South Africa . British driver Lewis Hamilton is a the reigning Formula One world champion . Africa is the only inhabited continent without a Formula One race, and it would represent an historic achievement should an event again take place in South Africa. Ecclestone is currently in the process of proposing terms for the country to again figure on the schedule, hopefully from 2016, and significantly with Cape Town the venue. Ecclestone said: 'I've been looking to go back to South Africa for a long time, and now we have a good chance. 'They're getting on with it. We're hoping to be back in 2016, but we will have a look and see. We'll see how we get on.' F1 has long been associated with a potential return to South Africa, although this would be Cape Town's first foray into the sport. Bernie Ecclestone has been holding negotiations in South Africa about bringing Formula One back there . The race was previously held in East London in 1962, 1963 and 1965 before moving to Kyalami - 20 miles north of Johannesburg - from 1967-1980 and 1982-1985, and again in 1992 and 1993. Should the race go ahead, and with Azerbaijan also scheduled to make its debut next year, there is the prospect of a record-breaking 22-race calendar on the cards for 2016.

"Simon Zebo and Andrew Conway both crossed twice as Munster dominated their Champions Cup dead rubber against a young Sale outfit at Thomond Park. Both sides were out of the running in Pool One, but the Irish province salvaged some pride with a runaway 65-10 bonus-point victory that included eight second-half tries. An early Zebo effort launched Munster towards a 10-0 lead, before the stubborn Sharks rallied with a tremendous Tom Arscott score and just three points separated the sides at the break. Munster full back Simon Zebo (centre) breaks away during his side's second-half rout of Sale . However, after Keith Earls crowned his first start of the season with an excellent individual try and a penalty try was added, the floodgates were well and truly opened as Pat Howard, Zebo, Andrew Conway (two), Tommy O'Donnell and Duncan Williams all touched down between the 65th and 80th minutes. Zebo, who shifted to full-back, reserves some of his best European performances for round six, including memorable hat-tricks against Northampton Saints (2012) and Racing Metro 92 (2013). He was on the scoresheet here within 90 seconds, stepping inside Arscott and stretching over to score past two covering defenders. Ian Keatley was keen to press his claims for the Ireland number 10 jersey, nailing a difficult first conversion from the right and quickly adding a penalty. Nick Macleod duly got Sale off the mark, but obstruction at the restart saw Keatley immediately respond. The Munster fly-half blotted his copybook, though, when allowing Arscott to fend him off near the left touchline as the Sale winger ran in a terrific solo try from outside the Munster 22. Macleod's conversion made it a three-point game. Munster winger Andrew Conway crashes over for the first of his two tries at Thomond Park . The visitors made further inroads thanks to a series of sloppy Munster penalties. Referee Marius Mitrea lost his patience when Conway killed the ball near his try-line and the wing was promptly sin-binned. The scores dried up during a niggly second quarter as Sale failed to take advantage of their numerical advantage and Keatley pushed a 40-metre penalty wide. But Earls lit up the second half with a try in the opening minute, taking a great line to gather an Ivan Dineen offload, dashing clear over halfway and finding a way past covering full-back Luke McLean. Television match official Eric Gonthier confirmed the grounding and Keatley converted for 20-10. The Munster pack took over approaching the hour mark, winning a penalty try from a dominant five-metre scrum. Keatley converted but some brilliant breakdown work saw Sale slow the province's bonus-point push. That was until Keatley's inviting inside pass released South African Howard for a very well-taken score under the posts. Zebo then completed his brace with an opportunist try, cleverly rolling from the back of a close-in ruck to reach over and make it 39-10. As replacements Dineen and Ronan O'Mahony increased their influence, Munster showed no mercy to the demoralised Sharks. Dineen and Zebo combined to send Conway clear, flanker O'Donnell crashed over from close range and prop Stephen Archer provided the initial break and the scoring pass for Williams' touchdown. There was still time for Zebo to break through the tired Sale defence and supply the assist for Conway's second try. Replacement JJ Hanrahan's third successful conversion gave Munster their highest ever score in European rugby - beating their 64 points in a 64-0 win over Viadana in December 2002.","Both sides were out of the running in Pool One of the Champions Cup .

CLICK HERE to read about Bradford striker James Hanson, the former shelf stacker . Bradford City boss Phil Parkinson has revealed he refused Chelsea counterpart Jose Mourinho's handshake during the latter stages of their FA Cup tie on Saturday, as he didn't want to tempt fate. Mourinho came over to the Bradford dugout to prematurely congratulate Parkinson and his staff after Mark Yates' goal put the visitors 4-2 ahead in injury time at Stamford Bridge.

Instead Parkinson (centre) walked past Mourinho as he chose to focus on the remainder of the match . CLICK HERE to read why Jose Mourinho said on Friday that it would be a 'disgrace' if Chelsea got knocked lost to Bradford in the FA Cup. 'He [Mourinho] came over to shake hands but at that point there was still three-and-a-half minutes left and I wasn't getting drawn into that,' Parkinson said in his post-match press conference. 'You know that if Chelsea got one [goal] back even at that late stage, and with their world class players on the pitch, they could easily have got a second [goal] so we wanted to concentrate on what we had to do and see the game through. 'He came in the dressing room afterwards [though] and shook everyone's hands - crediting the lads for their performances, which I thought was a real touch of class.' Premier League leaders Chelsea looked firm favourites to reach the fifth round of the FA Cup, when Gary Cahill and Ramires gave them a 2-0 lead after 38 minutes. Bradford players celebrate wildly Yeates' (bottom centre) strike as they close in on a historic win at Chelsea . However, Jon Stead pulled one back for the League One side just three minutes later before second-half strikes from Felipe Morais, Andy Halliday and Yeates completed a remarkable comeback for the Bantams. It's not the first-time this season that Mourinho has tried to shake hands with an opposing manager before the full-time whistle. Earlier this season in September, the Portuguese boss incensed Aston Villa counterpart Paul Lambert and his then-assistant manager Roy Keane. Chelsea were leading 3-0 when Mourinho decided to beat the traffic and walk down the Stamford Bridge tunnel, but the 'Special One' halted to say his goodbyes to Lambert and assistant manager Roy Keane first.

"It was what you might call drinking in the Stamford Bridge last chance saloon. Mohamed Salah, in all likelihood on his way out of Chelsea, was given one final chance to persuade Jose Mourinho to let him stay. The fact it was an FA Cup tie against League One opposition in Bradford City, sandwiched between two much more significant and high-profile League Cup games with Liverpool, said everything about the Egyptian’s Chelsea career since he arrived 12 months ago. He was only on the teamsheet because Mourinho needed to rest his key personnel for Tuesday night’s all-important second leg with the Reds. Plain and simple. In normal circumstances, he probably wouldn’t have made the squad, such are the talents at the manager’s disposal. Mohamed Salah of Chelsea attempts to ride the challenge of Bradford's Andrew Halliday at Stamford Bridge . The relentless pace of fighting for silverware on four fronts, the inescapable need to rotate the players to avoid injury and fatigue seems to be the only way the £11m Salah can get a game. He has played a mere 268 minutes of first-team football this season, spread over seven appearances across all competitions. It certainly hasn’t worked out the way he planned when he arrived from Basle with great fanfare last January. Including this one, Salah has featured in just 18 games for the club. His fate seems sealed. During the remaining days of the transfer window, Salah will head most likely to Roma on loan until the end of the campaign. A longer lasting decision will then be made. But he was at least granted one last opportunity to show Mourinho - and the Chelsea fans - what they’d be missing. It was certainly more than Andre Schurrle who, like at Liverpool on Tuesday, didn’t make the matchday squad. Bradford team-mates enjoy the moment having beaten Premier League leaders Chelsea in the FA Cup . Salah has made just 18 appearances for the Blues since signing from FC Basle in January 2014 . He too is heading for the exit door. While Mourinho was insistent in his pre-match comments that it would take a ‘phenomenal offer’ to spirit him away - Wolfsburg are believed to be front-runners - the reality is that Schurrle, just seven months after helping Germany to the World Cup, is out of favour. Mourinho’s follow-up comment that Schurrle needs to start out-performing Eden Hazard and Willian to regain his place sounded ominous indeed. Anyway, back to Salah who, with garish red boots and long sleeves on a nippy January afternoon, set out to prove he still has something to give. The initial signs weren’t promising. He was crowded out by Andy Halliday and Rory McArdle as he tried to make headway down the left and was quickly swapped with Loic Remy to take position on the right. Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho can't hide his frustration during the 4-2 defeat to Bradford on Saturday . Chelsea led on 15 minutes, Gary Cahill in the right place to deftly flick home an Oscar corner. The magnificent 6,000 travelling Bradford fans were silenced - at least temporarily. On 25 minutes, Salah’s first involvement of note, though it wasn’t particularly positive. Both he and Remy lunged to try and reach Didier Drogba’s cleverly threaded through ball. Remy swung his right leg, Salah his left. They clashed, the ball went to the goalkeeper. Remy shot his team-mate a glance of a thousand knives. Shortly afterwards, he received the ball wide right from a reluctant Remy, played it in to Ramires and then anticipated the return. It didn’t materialise. But his next contribution, along similar lines, was good. Ramires emerged from midfield, slotted the ball to Salah and, after a second’s delay, he played the perfect return for the Brazilian to roll the ball in off the post for 2-0. That was the timing and presence of mind Salah was bought for and has so seldom been able to display. The Egyptian winger struggled to impose himself against the League One opposition and was replaced . Jon Stead halved the deficit shortly before the break to ignite the contest again but to judge by Salah’s start to the second period, it was long settled. Two minutes in and he was showboating, producing a flurry of step-overs, rolling the ball left and right as Andrew Davies’ eyes flickered. It was nice to watch but totally out of context and there were even a few restless jeers from the crowd before Salah passed to Remy. There was one glimpse of the Salah Chelsea bought last year, a purposeful driving run through the middle. His pace carried him past three Bradford players and it led to a chance for Oscar. That was more like it. Mourinho talks to Andre Schurrle in training last week, with the German set to leave Chelsea this month . And five minutes later, he cut inside well onto his left foot and curled in a shot that went a couple of inches wide of the post. He was beginning to be genuinely influential. Then, with the game still delicately-poised at 2-1, it was suddenly all over. The No 17 went up on the board and Salah was replaced by Willian, whom Mourinho hoped would supply the class for a decisive third goal. There was a smattering of applause for the Egyptian, a few stood in appreciation. Salah, meanwhile, wore the regretful expression of somebody painfully aware all good things must come to an end.","Chelsea lost 2-4 at home to League One side Bradford in the FA Cup .

"Chelsea's £200million men were sunk by a supermarket shelf stacker who was plucked from non-League obscurity for the princely sum of £7,500. James Hanson was the only member of the Bradford City squad at Stamford Bridge to cost a fee, decided in a tribunal, after his move from Guiseley in 2009. The rest of Phil Parkinson’s parade of heroes were stitched together by a mixture of free transfers and low-key loan deals. Bradford team-mates enjoy the moment having thrown Premier League leaders Chelsea out the FA Cup . In contrast the total cost of Jose Mourinho’s shocked stars clanged the £200m mark. Even £99m of talent on the bench alone could not rescue Mourinho from the most embarrassing moment of his managerial career as the Bantams proved worth their weight in gold. The thrilling win sent Bradford’s 6,000 travelling fans at Stamford Bridge into dreamland and Parkinson hopes another glamorous tie awaits. ‘If Man United get through against Cambridge, I’d love to have a go at them,’ he said. ‘I’m sure if we went to Old Trafford, we’d have 15,000 fans there.

"Liverpool striker Daniel Sturridge has revealed he has returned to first team training following his recovery from a troublesome thigh injury. Sturridge, who has played just three games for the Reds so far this season, is in contention to face West Ham on Saturday. The 25-year-old's last match came for Roy Hodgson's England side against Norway back on September 3. Daniel Sturridge posted this image on to Instagram to celebrate his return to first team training . Sturridge looks on after picking up an injury in an England training session back in September 2014 . Sturridge has an outside chance of facing former side Chelsea in the second leg of the Capital One Cup on Tuesday, according to his manager Brendan Rodgers. Rodgers, speaking to BT Sport, said after his side's goalless draw against Bolton: 'Daniel trains with the team on Sunday – he’s at a real good level in terms of his fitness at the moment. 'He completed his final rehabilitation with the medical and sports science guys, so he'll be ready for the West Ham game - whether he starts or not will depend closer to the time. ‘We’ll see if we can get him back for the Chelsea game in midweek too.' Rodgers will be hoping Sturridge's return will provide his side with a timely boost in their quest to finish in the top four. His side are currently eighth, five points behind fourth-placed Manchester United. The Liverpool striker is looking forward to playing alongside team-mate Mario Balotelli .

"Fine margins and good fortune allowed Bath to claim a quarter-final place on Sunday afternoon. After the scorching demolition of Toulouse a week earlier, this was a victory for the earthy virtue of pack power. The home side had come into this contest at The Rec determined to reach the knock-out stages and also avenge the 37-10 drubbing they were subjected to in the reverse fixture back in October. Ultimately, they achieved both objectives, but despite finishing top of Pool Four, this was not a statement of intent that will reverberate around the European game. Bath wing Matt Banahan (centre) runs at the Glasgow defence during his side's 20-15 win on Sunday . Anthony Watson of Bath is tackled by Glasgow pair Sean Maitland and Finn Russell at the Recreation Ground . BATH: Watson; Agulla, Joseph, Eastmond (Devoto, 6; Ford, 71), Banahan; Ford (Burgess, 66), Cook (Stringer, 63); James (Auterac, 50), Webber (Batty, 50), Wilson (Thomas, 50); Hooper (capt), Day (Attwood, 56); Garvey, Houston (Fearns, 63), Louw. Tries: Penalty (2). Cons: Ford, Devoto. Pens: Ford (2). GLASGOW: Maitland; Seymour, Bennett, Dunbar (Horne, 46), Van Der Merwe (Lamont, 63); Russell, Pyrgos (Matawalu, 70); Reid, MacArthur, Cusack (Yanuyanutawa, 41); Gray, Kellock (capt); Nakarawa, Vernon, Brown. Tries: Dunbar, Vernon. Con: Russell. Pen: Russell. Yellow card: Kellock. Referee: James Lacey (Ireland). Att: 13,349 . Two penalty tries were a testament to Bath’s dominance in scrum and maul, but in most aspects of the game they were emphatically out-played by their Scottish opponents in this qualification decider. Glasgow’s ambition and open-field cohesion had already delivered two tries – one a long-range classic – and they so nearly snatched a third to secure a draw or win at the death. In the last minute, Lions full back Sean Maitland – an outstanding, threatening runner throughout – surged towards the left corner. He seemed certain to score but was stopped short of the line. The danger was not averted though and Pat MacArthur lunged to touch the ball down but fumbled at agonisingly close-range. Seconds later, Bath’s players celebrated the tense result, without knowing the wider implications. News soon filtered through from France that Toulouse, who had led the pool going into this final pool weekend, had been beaten by a single point at Montpellier, which meant that Mike Ford’s men had nipped in front of them to claim an automatic last-eight place. Seven days after running riot against one of the continent’s superpower clubs, this was an occasion far removed from that thrilling spectacle. Bath turned the screw in the scrum; led by their Anglo-Welsh prop pair – David Wilson and Paul James. But they were only actually in front for 19 minutes of this disjointed contest, which tells a tale of their struggle to impose themselves on rivals who appeared vulnerable due to the absence of several key players. Bath's players including Ollie Devoto (centre) and Dave Attwood (right) applaud their fans after the game . Bath forward Matt Garvey (centre) breaks free with the ball during their European Champions Cup clash . It didn’t help Bath’s cause that they lost influential England centre Kyle Eastmond to an injury early on, while his midfield partner, Jonathan Joseph – the hero of Toulouse – had limited opportunities to provide repeat fireworks and was largely contained. So the thrills and spills of round five gave way to dogged, primal force, to become the first team to win a pool after losing their first two games. ‘Last week you saw the dash, this week you saw the grunt,’ said director of rugby Mike Ford – to neatly encapsulate the contrast. ‘I’m pleased that when we weren’t playing our “A” game, we still found a way to win. It came down to small margins – they were attacking our line at the end but we came out on the right side of it. ‘We lost our first two games in October, so to end up as pool winners is brilliant. This club wants to play in the big games. A quarter-final of the Champions Cup will be a huge game and a huge step, it will be great for us.’ Glasgow deservedly went ahead in the fifth minute as DTH van der Merwe burst through Chris Cook’s attempted tackle and released impressive Scotland centre Alex Dunbar, who raced clear to score. Finn Russell converted and later – after half-time – the fly-half set the wheels in motion for the visitors’ scintillating second try.

Glasgow's Jonny Gray appears dejected after the final whistle at the Recreation Ground in Bath . From turn-over ball in his own half, the Glasgow No 10 stormed over halfway on the right and sent Mark Bennett away into space. After Tommy Seymour maintained the momentum, Bennett ran on and passed out for Richie Vernon to round off a devastating counter-attack. But for all their slick attacking, the Scottish side were undermined by their struggles up front. In the 52nd minute, Bath only had two George Ford penalties to show for their faltering efforts, but then a penalty to the left corner brought the hosts their first try. Captain Stuart Hooper won the lineout, the home pack drove for the line and when the maul went down, a penalty try was awarded, which Ford converted. Glasgow were soon back in front courtesy of a Russell penalty, but in the 66th minute Bath’s forwards delivered another decisive show of force. Anthony Watson had just squandered a clear scoring chance in the right corner – where he was superbly held up by Russell – but the subsequent scrum was another one-sided rout which yielded another penalty try for the West Country club. Ollie Devoto added the conversion to give Bath a five-point advantage but at the end they were hanging on. Francois Louw claimed one last turn-over to quell the Glasgow resistance and leave their head coach, Gregor Townsend, to lament the so-near-but-so-far outcome. ‘We came up two inches short,’ he said.

"The chant Cambridge United fans directed at £60m Angel di Maria on Friday night was an indicator of how much football can change in a short period of time. 'What a waste of money,' heckled the supporters, with the former Real Madrid star flattering to deceive as Manchester United failed to break down their League Two counterparts in the FA Cup. After a blistering start to life in the Premier League, the club record fee splashed out on Di Maria was heralded as a snip. But while the Argentine obviously has the quality, things are just not clicking under Louis van Gaal at present. Angel di Maria struggled at Cambridge United and was the subject of 'what a waste of money' chants . Di Maria, pictured alongside Louis van Gaal, was signed for a club record fee of £60m last summer . Comparisons can of course be drawn to Mesut Ozil who also flew out of the blocks before suffering with injuries and form, while La Liga is obviously an entirely different prospect to the Premier League. It is easier to pinpoint Di Maria's dip in form, though. United couldn't have pulled off a more suitable signature if they had tried when they lured the 26-year-old to England. The winger was in the form of his life, man of the match in the Champions League final last season, starring at the World Cup with Argentina. This was the man to reinvigorate the Red Devils, that flying No 7 fans crave in Manchester. A goal on his Old Trafford bow against QPR, as well as several fancy flicks and tricks, suggested United had found their new hero. Sportsmail's Chris Wheeler even claimed that there may not have been a better home debut since Wayne Rooney's hat-trick in 2004. He made 76 passes in that game, compared to just 21 against Southampton in his most recent home outing. Di Maria's home debut, a goalscoring one against QPR, was one of the best United fans had ever seen . Di Maria's touch map against QPR in September (left), compared to his stats against Southampton this month . The Argentine winger netted a superb chip against Leicester to make it two in two for United . Di Maria seemed to be enjoying his role in the midfield diamond (touch maps against Leicester and Everton) The Old Trafford faithful love their No 7s and they seemed to have their hands on a new star . A superb chip at Leicester followed, while he also netted against Everton. United would have been bereft of ideas during their 2-2 draw at West Brom in October were it not for Di Maria impressing in a diamond formation, or even in the much maligned 3-5-2. But Van Gaal was obviously uneasy with how his team were playing, and most importantly, defending. United had conceded 12 league goals in eight games after the draw at the Hawthorns, they've conceded nine in 14 since. 'That is what the club has been built on for the last 10 to 15 years – being able to get from box to box quickly, being able to spring on teams, having people that can dribble and are quick in the final third,' Sky Sports pundit and Manchester United legend Gary Neville said in August. 'This signing fits the bill in terms of what United are and the philosophy.' Di Maria's swashbucking runs forward have since disappeared. That pace and drive with the ball, with which he gathers confidence to show off his ability, seems to have been reined back. Louis van Gaal was unhappy with the way his side were playing and opted for a more cautious approach . Di Maria, pictured surrounded by players at QPR, seems to have been reined back by Van Gaal . With the attacking talent Van Gaal brought in last summer adding to the likes of Wayne Rooney, Robin van Persie and Juan Mata already at the club, he was always going to have a conundrum. But despite Di Maria's form out wide and starting moves further back, coupled with Radamel Falcao's eagerness to play, his next position to test out was up front. The counter attacking display at Arsenal was perfect for his talents as an out and out striker. His goal may have convinced his boss that this was a method to test in the future. Of course, Di Maria's versatility should not be disregarded. He was loved by Carlo Ancelotti in Madrid for his ability to operate out wide to compliment Cristiano Ronaldo and Gareth Bale in a 4-4-2, or testing the opposition centrally with his box-to-box runs in a 4-3-3. But his move from a withdrawn midfield role, to a brief spell at wing back to up top this season has been bizarre from Van Gaal, despite fans catching a glimpse of his talents when given the space to run. Injuries disrupted Di Maria in December, while Van Gaal's new-look cautious United kept grinding out wins. His return to the starting line up against Southampton saw him struggle more than ever in the role of a striker. Injuries have disrupted his season, only recently returning to the starting line up . Di Maria struggled at Cambridge (right) despite seeing plenty of the ball and played further up field at QPR (l) Di Maria was substituted against QPR after flattering deceive as a striker . Fans chanted '4-4-2' during United's win against QPR last weekend, obviously eager to see Di Maria on the ball on the wing rather than wasting his talents away from the action. The Dutch boss has since revealed that the formation leaves him 'twitching his ass', though that didn't refrain him from opting for the diamond at Cambridge, much to the delight of supporters. However, the Di Maria we saw at Abbey Stadium was not the player every one knows he can be. This was a player bereft of confidence (even Phil Jones was taking the corners), eager to make an impact on the game but his decision making was way off. Van Gaal was unhappy with his side's performance against League Two minnows Cambridge in a 0-0 draw . Di Maria had five shots against Cambridge, one of which ballooned out of the stadium . One of his five shots in particular was the subject of ridicule from the noisy home faithful, an effort from 30 yards which ballooned over the bar, and out of the stadium. Perhaps Van Gaal should have taken Di Maria out of the firing line in a game which obviously wasn't going to suit his ability. Perhaps a strong start masked over the fact that every player takes time to acclimatise in England. But the speed in which the super-talented midfielder has gone from star of world football to the butt of minnows' jokes will be worrying for United fans and Van Gaal.","Manchester United drew 0-0 with Cambridge United on Friday night .

"Read the full match report here . Relive Sportsmail's coverage as Real Madrid scraped past La Liga minnows Cordoba on Saturday with a late show. Gareth Bale struck home a penalty just minutes after star forward Cristiano Ronaldo saw red for slapping an opponent. Nabil Ghilas had put the hosts in front after just three minutes, before Karim Benzema equalised. Host commentator . The Cordoba players are clapped off the pitch, and rightly so. Incredible scenes at the end as Ronaldo is sent off for the limp Galacticos before Gareth Bale saves the day. Real extend their lead at the top, somehow. Of course, Bale scores. Who needs Ronaldo? Boos ring out at the Estadio Nuevo Arcangel. So harsh on Cordoba. The hosts have hung on so well but 10-man Real have got lucky. Bale's free-kick strikes a hand in the wall and the referee has no hesitation. Ronaldo is sent off! The star forward has had a poor day at the office and he is red carded after slapping (and kicking the defender). He was caught in a scuffle just before that as well. 70mins: Carlo Ancelotti can't bring off one his front three, can he? Left back for left back. 68mins: So close for Cordoba. Andone goes clear after a poor back pass, loops the ball over Casillas but the ball bounces and hit the bar. Unbelievable. 63mins: Not exactly an attacking sub, but Khedira looks shattered. On comes Illarramendi, who has been linked with a move to Arsenal. Can he kick Real into life? 55mins: Close again from Cordoba. Cartabia's shot fizzes just wide of the post. So flat here today, Real. Bebe then tests Casillas again with a low effort. He's getting closer... 53mins: Cordoba still not sitting back! A free-kick is met and the header loops back across goal but Varane just gets his head to it ahead of Ghilas. Away we go. Real Madrid can't get any worse, can they? Closer than we thought it would be, that's for sure. It's been more the half of Bebe than Ronaldo, the Cordoba man has been superb. Still, Ronaldo go in at half time level, which is probably more than they deserve. 34mins: Benzema again goes close at the back post, Ronaldo there too. Real Madrid really knocking on the door now. I would normally be saying a Real Madrid goal has been coming. But it hasn't. So cruel on the hosts as a Gareth Bale flick on is pocked home by Karim Benzema in what was Real's first real chance of the game. 24mins: First sight of goal for Cristiano Ronaldo, who I don't remember touching the ball this half. His free-kick sails harmlessly over the bar though. He promptly looks to the heavens. 18mins: Bebe goes close again! The former United winger makes space on the right edge of the box but his shot whistles past the post with Casillas motionless. Minutes later, his volley his straight at the Real goalkeeper. 15mins: Closest Real have come so far. Benzema finds space at the back post but his volley is punched away by the goalkeeper. Gareth Bale was nearby but was flagged for offside. 13mins: Very fast start here from the hosts. Bebe again dances away down the right but his cross is way overhit and it's a goalkick. You'd think they will need more than one to get anything out of today's game. 8mins: Forward they come again! Bebe breaks away but his cutback to Andone is deflected. Looking for that second goal on the counter, here. What a start for the minnows! Nabil Ghilas scores his sixth goal of the season, sending the ball into the top right corner. No chance for Iker Casillas. Cordoba go straight on the attack... and they've got a penalty! A shot is hit hard towards the goal and it strikes Sergio Ramos' hand. Not much he could have done there, bit harsh. But what a chance! Got a feeling of a cup game this one. Small stadium, fans close to the pitch - the tunnel the players walked through looked a bit like a greenhouse, which is nice. Yes - there was a familiar name in that Cordoba starting XI... it's Bebe!

"Ronny Deila watched his Celtic side open up a 'very pleasing' three-point gap over Aberdeen at the top of the Scottish Premiership with a 1-0 win over Ross County in Dingwall on Saturday then immediately turned his attention to his first game against Rangers. The Hoops also have a game in hand over the Dons and are in fine fettle ahead of the Scottish League Cup semi-final at Hampden Park next Sunday afternoon after securing their fourth successive win. It was Kris Commons' deflected strike early in the second-half which gave the visitors a narrow but deserved win over the league's bottom side and continued the debate about whether or not the 31-year-old midfielder should be offered a two-year extension to his current deal which ends in the summer, instead of the one year on the table. Celtic's Kris Commons (right) beats Ross County keeper Antonio Reguero (left) but fails to hit the net . The Parkhead boss, as he has done all along, insisted that he wants the player to sign a new contract but what is more certain is that Celtic will face Rangers for the first time since April, 2012. The beleaguered Championship club are trying to make their way through the leagues after re-emerging in the bottom tier of Scottish football following their descent into administration and liquidation, and will go into the match with caretaker boss Kenny McDowall having signalled his intention to leave against the backdrop of a boardroom battle and continuing cash concerns. Deila is concentrating only on his own club but recognised the magnitude of the match. Celtic's Commons celebrates his goal with teammates during the Scottish Premiership match . 'I really look forward to it and I think we are in good place now,' said the Norwegian. 'We know it's a big game for many reasons. 'All around the match there's going to be atmosphere and history. It's going to be a different challenge. 'We are favourites. If we perform at our very best then it is very hard to beat us. It's up to us.' Life at the other end of the table is proving less exciting for struggling County who have gone 10 games without a win. Celtic manager Ronny Deila celebrates going three points clear at the top of the Scottish Premier League . Manager Jim McIntyre could take some solace from the fact that relegation rivals St Mirren and Motherwell also lost. The Staggies remain four points behind second-bottom Buddies, whom they lost 2-1 to in Dingwall last week, albeit the Highland club have played two games less. McIntyre tried to look for positives from the display against Celtic. He said: 'We didn't do things right against St Mirren last weekend and we showed the right reaction. 'Our previous two home performances had been poor so it was important that we gave our fans some encouragement. 'We did that and our energy levels were excellent.'

"Glen Johnson will turn down the chance to join Roma and sign a new three year contract with Liverpool. The 30-year-old was heading for the Anfield exit this summer after an impasse over contract talks allowed Roma to step in and offer the England international a Bosman transfer. Johnson was free to talk to foreign clubs as his Liverpool deal was due to expire in July. Glen Johnson in action against Emile Heskey during the FA Cup clash with Bolton at Anfield on Saturday . Inter and AC Milan also showed interest but Roma were most keen and Johnson was interested after hearing good reports back from former England teammate Ashley Cole. Liverpool had looked unlikely to return to the negotiating table until manager Brendan Rodgers intervened. He called in Johnson for a chat about his future and insisted he still had a role to play. Rodgers is wary that the loss of Steven Gerrard will leave him short of experienced players in the dressing room while recent success playing a 3-4-2-1 system has reaffirmed his belief that formation would suit Johnson's attributes better. Johnson, set to sign a new three-year-deal at Liverpool, clears the ball during the 0-0 draw with Bolton . After speaking with the manager at length, Johnson has been convinced he can continue his career at Anfield. Rodgers said: 'The intention will be to keep everyone – we can't have three or four leaving next season. Steven will obviously be a loss. When you are losing someone of that calibre of man and player it would be a loss to any club. 'For the younger players to develop their potential they are going to need that seniority around them. You can't just have a whole group of young players. The England international pumps his fist having scored against Stoke back in November . Johnson, heading in against Stoke, has only made 15 appearances for the Anfield club so far this season . 'Glen is not the marauding full-back of six or seven years ago but he is still a quality player and he has a lot to offer with his experience. His game will adapt over the next couple of years and we want to keep him. 'Like every player he will want that security and to get it sorted earlier than it is now, but when he looks at it and realises he is at one of the biggest clubs in the world, with a team which is developing and growing, he would want to be a part of that.

"American Lindsey Vonn equaled Austrian Annemarie Moser-Proell's 35-year-old record of 62 women's Alpine skiing World Cup victories when she won a downhill race in Cortina d'Ampezzo on Sunday. The four times World Cup overall winner and 2010 Olympic champion, who returned to action this season after a year out due to knee operations, can now break the record in Monday's Super-G at the same Italian resort. Vonn, 30, also celebrated her 32nd downhill win -- four fewer than Moser-Proell who set her record between 1970 and 1980. Lindsey Vonn won the Cortina downhill to secure 62nd World Cup victory . She equaled Austrian Annemarie Moser-Proell's 35-year-old record of most World Cup wins . However, only four disciplines were on the World Cup programme during the great Austrian's era, with the Super-G not introduced until the 1983 season. ""It's been a long way to get to where I am now. If I look back on my career, I can hardly believe I won that much,"" said Vonn. ""I could never have imagined I would go that far and that high,"" she added. Sweden's Ingemar Stenmark holds the men's all-time record of World Cup wins with 86 between 1975 and 1989. Vonn returned to action this season after a year out with a knee injury . Vonn shoots down the course in Cortina at blistering speed . The American soars into the air with a jump from the slope . It was no easy task for Vonn, who was only 10th in a shortened downhill held in Cortina on Friday after being rescheduled from the Austrian resort of Bad Kleinkirchheim. The regular Cortina downhill, which Vonn has won three times in the past, had been postponed from Saturday to Sunday due to snowfalls. Vonn used her peerless technical skills and experience of the piste to win the third downhill of her comeback season in one minute and 39.61 seconds in front of her parents and relatives. ""I never gave up,"" said Vonn, who took her comeback win in a downhill in Lake Louise, Canada, this season. ""I knew deep inside that I would one day reach this record but now all my family came to support me and to celebrate this special moment. It's such a beautiful day for me. I wanted to do it for them,"" added Vonn, the girlfriend of golfer Tiger Woods. Former downhill world champion Elisabeth Goergl of Austria was second, 0.32 seconds adrift, 0.18 faster than third-placed local favourite Daniela Merighetti. Fellow-Italian Elena Fanchini, winner of Friday's shortened race on the same course, was fourth, 0.77 off the pace.

"Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers has told striker Mario Balotelli he will not get picked for the squad unless he improves in training. The £16million summer signing did not make the squad for the goalless FA Cup fourth round draw at home to Bolton despite being fit after illness. 'Balotelli wasn't injured, he was just not selected,' said Rodgers. 'It's tough for him. Mario Balotelli failed to make the bench for Liverpool's FA Cup clash with Bolton on Saturday .

'We had an hour or so yesterday (Friday) chatting. He understands where we are at. He was out for a week not well. 'I am judging it every day in training - Mario is exactly the same as every other player, there is no special treatment for anyone,' said the Reds boss. 'We had an hour or so yesterday chatting and he understands where he is at. He knows exactly what is required to be in this squad before he can be in the team.' 'But he knows the level of what this team is at. He has seen the pressing and aggression and if you can't do that, then you aren't going to be a part of that.' 'Mario will work very hard to feature again. I'm confident he will respond in the right way.' Daniel Sturridge will return to full training at Melwood on Monday having not featured for Liverpool since August. Balotelli has failed to find the back of the net in the Premier League since arriving from AC Milan . Sturridge has only recently returned to light training after a long spell out with a thigh injury . Sturridge and Balotelli last played together for Liverpool in a 3-0 victory over Spurs on August 31 . The striker is scheduled to appear in next weekend's Premier League clash against West Ham United and could even make the squad for Tuesday's Capital One Cup semi-final second leg at Chelsea. 'Daniel starts training tomorrow (Monday) with the team,' said Rodgers. 'He had his final rehabilitation with the sports science team today and now it's about getting the condition with football fitness and game fitness.

"Host commentator . Host commentator . That's your transfer news for today. Join us again tomorrow from 9pm for more deals, news and rumours. So, Jose Mourinho claims Andre Schurrle missed today's shock defeat to Bradford through injury - not because he is set to leave the club. We will leave you to decide whether you believe him or not... According to Sky Sports, Chelsea and Fiorentina are still in talks over a £26m move for Colombian winger Juan Cuadrado. The problem seems to be that Chelsea don't want to pay the winger's release clause but the Italians won't budge. So, who will blink first? Sampdoria coach Sinisa Mihajlovic says Samuel Eto'o is set to join the club but has told his players not to be distracted by the Everton forward's arrival. Eto'o is in Rome for a medical and is due to be presented to the crowd before Sunday's Serie A match at home to Palermo. Mihajlovic said: 'Eto'o is joining this team but he must not be a distraction. 'He's a great player, who has won everything and that attracts a lot of attention from the media, but this should not distract us.' Tottenham have been linked with a move for PSG midfielder Adrien Rabiot, but his manager Laurent Blanc wants to keep him in France. John Brayford has joined Sheffield United on a three-and-a-half-year contract for a fee believed to be £1.5m, reports Sportsmail's Riath Al-Samarrai. Spanish journalist Kike Marin says Arsenal and Villarreal have agreed a fee of 18million euros (£13.45m) for Gabriel Paulista, who is travelling to London - presumably to complete the paperwork and a medical. So, have Arsenal finally got their man? Stay tuned for the latest update. Andre Schurrle has been left out of Chelsea's squad for their FA Cup tie with Bradford, sparking speculation that he could be on his way out of Stamford Bridge. Jose Mourinho said on Friday that the midfielder would play in today's game, but also admitted he would sell if a 'phenomenal' offer was made for the 24-year-old. Joel Campbell did not train with his Arsenal team-mates on Saturday, fueling speculation he is set to leave the club and join Real Sociedad. Real Sociedad want the 22-year-old Campbell either on loan or in an £8million permanent deal. Villarreal, Benfica, Inter Milan, Swansea City and West Bromwich Albion are also interested but are waiting to hear if Arsenal are ready to let him leave. Reports flying around that Paris Saint-Germain striker Ezequiel Lavezzi has been told he can leave Paris Saint-Germain this month. The striker failed to show up for a training camp in Morocco and now boss Laurent Blanc has reportedly had enough and wants to sell the 29-year-old. Brendan Rodgers is reportedly keen on Lavezzi as he looks to boost his options upfront. Real Madrid have already signed 16-year-old wonderkid Martin Odegaard and now, according to Gazzetta dello Sport, they are after another young star in AC Milan's Hachim Mastour. Mastour has also been linked with Manchester United and is being closely watched by Real. Barcelona defender Dani Alves has been continually linked with a move away from the Nou Camp and reports in Spain suggest Manchester United are confident of signing him. Sportsmail reported earlier this month that Alves was in talks about extending his contract which runs out at the end of the season, but it seems progress has been slow and United are ready to pounce. This may not be the last we have heard of this one... It has been claimed that Newcastle United striker Papiss Cisse has been offered a staggering contract by Sven Goran Eriksson's side, which would make him one of the best paid players in the world. Cisse has 18 months left on his deal at Newcastle and the club would reportedly be willing to sell him for a fee in the region of £8million - rather than risk losing him on a free. Cisse's total package - £150,000 a week for three years - could see the 29-year-old earn an incredible £22.5m should he move to China. Paul Pogba will not be leaving Juventus in the January transfer, according to agent Mino Raiola. The 21-year-old is reportedly wanted by the likes of Chelsea, Real Madrid and former club Manchester United but looks set to remain in Turin until at least the end of the season having only recently signed a five-year deal with the Serie A champions. Reports this morning suggest that West Ham midfielder Ravel Morrison is set to join Serie A club Lazio on a free transfer this summer - as first reported by Sportsmail last week. He has reportedly agreed a deal with the Italians but not signed an official contract just yet. Sportsmail understands that a team of agents flew to Rome two weeks ago to discuss the move. Radamel Falcao endured another frustrating night for Manchester United against Cambridge United, and his agent Jorge Mendes has a theory as to why the striker is struggling. Mendes claims his client would be better if Sir Alex Ferguson was still United manager, rather than Louis van Gaal. Cruzeiro manager Marcelo Oliveira says Real Madrid have signed a technically gifted player in midfielder Lucas Silva. Oliveira has backed the 21-year-old to be a success at the Bernabeu following his £11.5m move. He said: 'I have been behind him when he has shot from outside the area and believe me he has a lot of potential that can be further exploited.' Cristiano Ronaldo was close to joining Arsenal in 2003 but the club didn't have the money to complete the deal because they were building the Emirates Stadium. Instead, Ronaldo joined United in a £12m deal and, as they say, the rest is history... Steven Gerrard may be leaving Liverpool for La Galaxy in the summer, but Brendan Rodgers says he wants to keep the rest of his senior stars at Anfield. Kolo Toure (33), Glen Johnson (30) and Brad Jones (32) are in the final six months of their deals, while Martin Skrtel (30) has 18 months left on his contract and Lucas Leiva has been linked with a move to Inter Milan. But Brendan Rodgers wants them to stay as he plans to mount a title challenge next season. Reports in Italy suggest that Inter Milan are lining up a £7m summer move for Yaya Toure. The 32-year-old has had a rocky relationship with Manchester City in the last 18 months - accusing the club of disrespecting him by not celebrating his birthday. And Gazzetta dello Sport claim the midfielder would be happy to join up with former boss Mancini in the summer. Real Madrid have reached a deal to sign midfielder Lucas Silva from Brazilian club Cruzeiro on a long-term contract. Madrid said on Friday that Silva has signed a contract tying him to the European champions until June 30, 2020. Silva had been linked with a move to Arsenal, but instead opted to join the Spanish club rather than the Premier League. CLICK HERE TO READ THE FULL STORY . Arsenal appear to have received a boost in the race to sign Gabriel Paulista in January as Villarreal left the £15million-rated defender out of their squad to face Levante at the weekend. Villarreal announced the 18-man squad to face Levante at El Madrigal and listed the players who would miss the match through injury or suspension. However Paulista's name was left off the official club announcement altogether, which suggests he has moved a step closer to leaving the Spanish outfit. CLICK HERE TO READ THE FULL STORY .

"Cristiano Ronaldo's agent has revealed that Arsenal failed to sign the Portuguese forward because their move to the Emirates Stadium left them with no money. The three-time Ballon d'Or winner eventually joined the Gunners' rivals Manchester United in 2003, but Jorge Mendes admitted that even he thought his client would end up playing for Arsene Wenger. 'There was a moment in which I really thought he was going to Arsenal,' Mendes said in his new book, The Key to Mendes. 'David Dein is a spectacular person but, with the construction of their stadium, they were left with very little money and it wasn't possible.'

CLICK HERE to read about the Arsenal XI made up of players they nearly signed. Ronaldo himself remembers the trip to Arsenal well. He said: 'We were travelling by car and Jorge was calling us constantly telling me to hide so no one would see me. 'We went to a service station and I hid my face. I remember back then that Jorge was going crazy, those were Jorge's craziest days.' Ronaldo scored 118 goals during his six years in Manchester, and Mendes insists the man responsible for his development there was also a key figure in bringing him to the club. He said: 'The only person key to everything was Alex Ferguson. He told me that Cristiano was going to play at least 50 per cent of the games for Manchester United and that's what I wanted to hear. 'That's why Cristiano went to Manchester United.' When Wenger was asked about the proposed transfer in 2013, though, he recalled a slightly different version of events. The Frenchman admitted money had been an issue, but claimed there was another aspect to United's offer that the Gunners couldn't compete with. He said: 'What happened was that Carlos Queiroz went to Manchester United and they snapped him away from us because he knew him from Sporting. 'That's what life is about. You give your best but sometimes you might find that people are stronger than you. That can happen as well.' Arsenal wanted to sign Ronaldo from Sporting Lisbon but never managed to seal a deal for him . Ronaldo eventually moved to Manchester United, where he scored 118 goals .

"Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers believes playmaker Philippe Coutinho has come into his own in the last few weeks. The Brazil international struggled to find his form in the early part of the season but the Reds boss believes that was down to a readjustment process the youngster was going through after the sale of Luis Suarez and the long-term injury to Daniel Sturridge. However, the installation of Raheem Sterling as a central striker providing pace and movement on the forward line has brought the best out of Coutinho, who produced an influential performance in Tuesday's Capital One Cup semi-final first leg 1-1 draw with Chelsea. Philippe Coutinho (right) capped his impressive form of late with a dominant display against Chelsea . He has also been helped by the reintroduction of two central midfielders, particularly one as defensively-minded as compatriot Lucas Leiva, as it has relieved some of the responsibility of tracking back. 'He was outstanding the other night,' Rodgers said of Coutinho. 'He is that bit of magic who makes that last pass in the final third. 'Last year he had Suarez and Sturridge to make those passes to but he hasn't had that. 'Up until six or seven weeks ago he didn't have that ability to make the threaded pass through. 'Once we had that bit of mobility and speed and movement at the top end of the field - and the others around him - that has really helped him. 'He is a class act and still has so much development left to make and he is playing very well.' With a must-win semi-final second leg against Chelsea coming up on Tuesday, Rodgers has to decide just how many changes he can afford to make to rest important players for the FA Cup visit of Bolton without interrupting the rhythm of a side who look to have finally found their feet. Brendan Rodgers believes that Raheem Sterling's (right) forward role has helped Coutinho hit form . Rodgers must decide whether to play the duo against Bolton in the fourth round of the FA Cup . Since the turn of the year Rodgers has kept changes to a minimum as, with the exception of AFC Wimbledon in the previous round, he has made no more than two alterations to his line-up in their four other matches. 'We want to progress in the next round. I will do what I have done right the way through the season and look at our squad,' he added. 'We have some very good players and make some changes but not too many. 'We have kept it pretty consistent through December and I think the players who haven't been playing have been on the outside looking in seeing how the team has functioned and how well it has functioned. 'There is always a balance between consistency and rotation but it shouldn't disrupt the flow of our play so much.' Wanderers may be 15th in the SkyBet Championship but Rodgers will not under-estimate them as he has been impressed with the turnaround manager Neil Lennon has affected since taking over in early October. Neil Lennon has recently taken over at Bolton and Rodgers thinks he will soon be in the Premier League . 'He has been outstanding. I was very surprised he didn't get a Premier League job,' said the Reds boss of his fellow Northern Irishman and former Celtic manager. 'I thought he was primed and set up with his experiences to come into a Premier League job but unfortunately for him it didn't work out that way. 'He has gone into Bolton and done a brilliant job. I think they have only lost three times since he went in when they were bottom of the table . 'It might be a difficult ask but it wouldn't surprise me if they got into the play-offs by the end of the season. 'In the near future Neil will be in the Premier League, either with or without Bolton. 'He is a good guy, a real thinker of the game, and he has a great career ahead of him in management.'","Brendan Rodgers hails the recent form of playmaker Philippe Coutinho .

"Sportsmail's Jamie Carragher didn't hold back when discussing Arsenal's dressing room photo on Sky Sports' Monday Night Football show. Former Manchester United midfielder Paul Scholes has backed-up his ex-England team-mate Jamie Carragher by ripping into the craze of taking post-match dressing room pictures. Speaking on Sky Sports' Monday Night Football show, Sportsmail columnist Carragher criticised Aaron Ramsey and his Arsenal team-mates for taking a snap behind the scenes at the Etihad after their 2-0 win against Manchester City last weekend. And Scholes, who believes the dressing room should be a private place, agrees that those sort of pictures should be reserved for when a team has won a trophy. Aaron Ramsey  celebrates with  Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, Olivier Giroud and Per Mertesacker at the Etihad . Paul Scholes believes dressing room photos should be reserved for showing off trophies like the FA Cup . Santi Cazorla celebrates with Olivier Giroud after converting his penalty to give Arsenal the lead against City . In his column for The Independent, Scholes wrote: 'It was Aaron Ramsey doing it on Sunday after Arsenal beat Manchester City 2-0 at the Etihad Stadium, although I am told he is by no means the only offender. 'In my world the dressing room was sacrosanct. The only time anyone was permitted to take pictures in there was when we had won a trophy. Unless I am wrong, Arsenal only got three points for beating City. It wasn't the European Cup final.' Scholes spent almost 20 years in United's first-team and he insists that during his time at Old Trafford the dressing room was always respected as a place for the players, even by manager Sir Alex Ferguson. He added: 'If you want a measure of how private a place the dressing room was when I was growing up at Manchester United, consider this: even Sir Alex Ferguson would knock before coming into the dressing room at the Cliff, the old training ground. The dressing room is for the players, and the players only. It was a rule respected by all the staff at Old Trafford.' Sir Alex Ferguson used to knock on .

'In my final couple of years at United we had one player, new to the team and young, who posted a picture from the dressing room on Instagram or Twitter,' Scholes wrote. 'I won't embarrass him by naming him because that too would contradict the rules about what stays private.

"According to reports in Spain Real Madrid have won the race to sign Cruzeiro midfielder Lucas Silva, who had also been linked with a move to Arsenal. News of Silva's arrival will delight fans at the Bernabeu after he revealed Madrid were one of his two favourite teams in Europe - along with Spanish rivals Barcelona. What kind of player is he? A very modern Brazilian – not a flair player but unflappable in the holding midfield role. He can dictate the pace of a game and organize a team. He has a great first touch and good awareness. And he’s only 21 so he has plenty of years ahead of him to adjust to European football. He also has a reputation for being level-headed and willing to learn and improve – essential if he’s to fit in at a big club and learn a new language. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Lucas Silva score 35 yard screamer for Cruzeiro! Real Madrid have . The 21-year-old currently plies his trade in the Brazilian top tier for league champions Cruzeiro . And he’s done well in Brazil? Cruzeiro have just won the league there and his consistent displays throughout the season were important in that success. He was named in the league’s team of the season at the end of the campaign. Price? Cruzeiro president Gilvan de Pinho Tavares has said he will not negotiate for anything less than £12million. He also knows there are several clubs interested with Real Madrid, Inter and Arsenal all keen. What’s his preference? He has been quoted as saying that his favourite teams in Europe are Madrid and Barcelona. But that answer may well differ according to who is asking. He has also said the European-based player he models himself on is Yaya Toure. After a consistent performances for his club the Cruzeiro man featured in the Serie A team of the season . Modelling himself on Manchester City midfielder Yaya Toure Silva could be on his way to the Premier League . Does he get forward as well as Toure? He only scored three times last season for his club but he did score in the Under 20 Toulon tournament for Brazil against England last May. Brazil went on to beat France in the final and he was one of the stand-out performers. He is not as attacking a player as Toure but he doesn’t just sit; he brings the ball out from the back. Has he played for Brazil yet? He has moved up to the Under 23s and will step up to the senior team soon without doubt. He will definitely be part of the Olympic team at Rio 2016. He’s not the finished product though? Not by any means. Cruzeiro’s previous coach Celso Roth wanted to loan him out for experience and it was only when Marcelo Oliveira took over as manager that he became first choice. So another project for Arsenal if Wenger lands him then? Real Madrid seem pretty convinced they have him but who knows? It’s a long road to the first team at the Santiago Bernabeu. Arsene Wenger would certainly be able to offer him first team football sooner so that may persuade him to turn his back on Madrid and move to London.","According to Spanish press Lucas Silva has signed for Real Madrid .

He had hidden behind a skeleton-covered mask before surprising Vonn but it seems she was not the only one who didn't recognise the former world No 1, as the media promptly trampled him. Tiger Woods lost one of his two front teeth after a cameraman knocked it out on Monday . Woods hid behind shades, a hat and a scarf as he prepared to surprise his girlfriend . 'During a crush of photographers at the awards' podium at the World Cup event in Italy, a media member with a shoulder-mounted video camera pushed and surged towards the stage, turned and hit Tiger Woods in the mouth,' Woods' agent Mark Steinberg said. 'Woods's tooth was knocked out by the incident.' Vonn broke Annemarie Moser-Proell's 35-year-old record of 62 World Cup wins with a flawless run down the Olympia delle Tofane course, finishing 0.85 ahead of Anna Fenninger of Austria. Woods, who surprised Vonn after her win, covered his face with a mask on Monday . 'I'm so happy to have finished the weekend with win No. 63. My family and Tiger is here. It's a really, really special day,' Vonn said following her triumph. Vonn had been on track to shatter the record two years ago before a high-speed crash at the 2013 world championships in Schladming, Austria, when she tore two ligaments in her right knee. She attempted to return for Sochi but re-injured her knee in Val d'Isere, France, in December, 2013, requiring a second surgery. She is planning to compete through the 2018 Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea. After girlfriend Vonn made alpine skiing history, she embraced Woods at the finish line . Vonn became the most successful female in Alpine skiing World Cup history when she won the Super-G .","Tiger Woods was about to surprise Lindsey Vonn in Italy on Monday when an over-eager camera operator hit him in the mouth with his equipment .

"A national audience will be hoping Manchester United slip up when they take on League Two Cambridge United in the FA Cup Fourth Round in front of the live television cameras on Friday night. But viewers should be warned, United boast a pretty impressive record against underdogs in this competition. Here, Sportsmail looks back at how they’ve fared against the minnows during the past 25 years. January 1990, R4: Hereford (A) 1-0 . Alex Ferguson was under pressure on the back of a 2-0 defeat at Norwich which left United in 19th position.

"Kell Brook cranked up his war of words with Amir Khan by declaring himself 'willing to die' in order to put an end to the decade-long feud with his British welterweight enemy. There are few more bitter rivalries in world boxing than the one between 28-year-old Brook and Bolton's Khan, who both now campaign at the 147lb limit but are yet to face each other in the ring, with the exception of a heated sparring session. But Brook strengthened his chances of landing a money-spinning clash with Khan by winning the IBF title in August, via decision against American Shawn Porter, and has continued to call him out since. Kell Brook poses with his IBF welterweight belt after his first defence against Jo Jo Dan was announced . Brook hopes he can set up a British super-fight against Amir Khan for later in the year . The 28-year-old explained: 'I'm the champion so he should be chasing me now. But the reason why I'm still mentioning him is because since I was 18 years old when I turned professional, every conversation and interview I've had his name has always come up. 'I want to put it to bed and prove to everyone in Britain that I'm No 1. Even though I am the No 1 in the world I want to show that he's not on my level. 'The night I fight Amir Khan, a bit of my soul will be left in that ring. I'm willing to die in that ring just to prove all of this talk right. I will be leaving a bit of me in that ring that night.' Brook's promoter, Eddie Hearn, offered Khan £3million to fight his charge last year and revealed in his Sportsmail column that he would be willing to offer him even more to make the fight in 2015 and has even booked Wembley Stadium in the summer with that showdown in mind. Hearn agreed late on Wednesday night for Brook to face Canada-based Romanian Jo Jo Dan in the first defence of his title in Sheffield on March 28. What's more, Dan is Brook's mandatory challenger which means he will be free to pursue any fight he chooses once he takes care of the IBF's allocated No.1 contender. Brook celebrates beating Shawn Porter in Los Angeles to win his world title last summer . Brook was stabbed while on holiday in Tenerife and feared he may never fight again . A voluntary defence in March would have left Brook obligated to fight Dan in the summer which would have ended hopes of an all-British megafight with Khan in June, which could generate the same nationwide appeal as Carl Froch's fight with George Groves at Wembley last May. But first Brook must take care of Dan and he admits it is easy to look past him, with such lucrative fights on the horizon. He conceded: 'It is difficult because you look at those massive names and massive fights that you've dreamed of as a young kid growing up. 'But I'm among them now. There are three men out there with belts in this division – one is Manny Pacquiao, one is Floyd Mayweather and one is Kell Brook. I'm at the highest table in the hottest division and can be involved in some massive fights. 'But you've got to take care of business, if you don't get past this obstacle in front of you, you know you won't get to those fights. You've just got to concentrate on what is in front of you.' The homecoming fight at Sheffield's Motorpoint Arena will be tinged with emotion as it will be Brook's first outing since an horrific machete attack during a holiday to Tenerife in September left him fearing for his life. Khan (right) delicered his best performance to date against Devon Alexander in Las Vegas last month . But after making a full recovery, Brook says he is using the trauma to spur him on. He said: 'I remember being laid in Tenerife being next to a red-hot window and nobody in the hospital even speaking English and I was there with my leg tied up thinking 'will I ever walk again?' 'From winning that world title, going from cloud nine to laying in that hospital bed it has been a rollercoaster. But the fact is, I'm here now and it's been a long time. But I'm back now at 100mph doing everything I could before the attack. 'I've put it behind me. It was a chapter of the Kell Brook story and now I don't let it get to me. I turn a negative into a positive. I'm lucky to be here and looking at my kids. I'm fit and well and I will get on with what I've got to get on with. 'The knife attack has really pushed me on but it is about earning a few quid now. I want to prove to everyone that it was not a fluke or a one-off, I'm the real deal. I was born for this.' Jo Jo Dan earned his shot at Brook by becoming the IBF's mandatory challenger to the title .","Kell Brook is desperate to face rival Amir Khan this year .

"Louis van Gaal insists the way forward for Manchester United is to ditch the 4-4-2 formation. If that is the case then it would seem unlikely United will ever win the English league title under their Dutch manager. Why? Just take the Premier League years for a start. Van Gaal, pictured at Loftus Road, has said he twitches his 'ass' on the bench when his play 4-4-2 . Manchester United have often struggled to create while playing Van Gaal's favoured 3-5-2 formation . Fans were heard chanting '4-4-2' during United's 2-0 win against QPR at Loftus Road last weekend . Since its inception in 1992 every title winner - Manchester United, Blackburn, Arsenal, Chelsea and Manchester City - have played with four at the back. Mostly their formations have been 4-4-2, with variations on that theme. In recent seasons there has been a move to 4-5-1 or 4-3-3 and twists to those basic shapes often in the guise of an anchor midfielder. But the bedrock has been the same: four at the back. And, prior to that, no team that won the old First Division did so playing with three at the back on a regular basis. There were occasions in the Eighties and Nineties when Liverpool –Lawrenson. Hansen, Gillespie - and Arsenal – Bould, O’Leary, Adams (and later Keown) did play 3-5-2 on their way to titles, although in the case of the Gunners under George Graham it was more like 5-3-2. This five at the back line-up was at times akin to the famous catenaccio tactic favoured in Italy for decades until AC Milan swept all before them with 4-4-2. Defenders David O'Leary, Steve Bould and Tony Adams were often deployed in a 3-5-2 formation with Arsenal . There were also occasions when Liverpool trialled the formation with Lawrensen, Hansen and Gillespie . W-M formation: When three at the back was the rule . But essentially you would have to go back to the 1950s to see when three at back was the rule rather than the exception in England as the old ‘W-M’ formation evolved into what became the accepted shape of a team numbered one to 11 (pictured right). 1 Goalkeeper, 2 Right back, 3 Left back, 4 Right half, 5 Centre half, 6 Left half, 7 Right winger, 8 Inside right, 9 Centre forward, 10 Inside left, 11 Left winger. This was 2-3-2-3 or 3-2-2-3 depending how deep the centre half sat. It was under Ron Greenwood at West Ham at the start of the Sixties that 4-4-2 was really born in England when he withdrew his No 6 (a certain Bobby Moore) to play alongside the centre half in the role of attacking centre back rather than defensive midfielder. Four at the back then became de rigueur. Most teams played 4-2-4, which is 4-4-2 with attacking wingers. But after ditching his during England’s 1966 World Cup win, Alf Ramsey and his ‘wingless wonders’ defined for some time the English way. Van Gaal has said this system makes his ‘ass twitch' because it unbalances his Manchester United team, even though they have won more games this season playing that way than in any other shape. The 4-4-2 was really born in England when Rob Greenwood withdrew Bobby Moore to a deeper position . Although Van Gaal never played a senior match for Ajax he was brought up in the Sixties and Seventies at the club which became famed for creating Total Football. It was essentially a fluid 3-4-3 which came to the fore with Holland at the 1974 World Cup finals. The great irony is that the man who would have created Van Gaal’s mistrust in the English way was, well, English. The guru of Total Football - according to the kingpin of Ajax and Holland at the time, Johann Cruyff - was Victor Frederick Buckingham who was born in London in 1915. Buckingham played as a wing half for Tottenham between the wars. In 1959 he quit as West Bromwich Albion manager to take over at Ajax for two seasons. He returned for another spell in 1964 setting down the Total Football template. Alf Ramsey's 'wingless wonders' at the 1966 World Cup defined the English way for some time . Johan Cruyff (left, of Ajax) and Louis van Gaal (right, of Sparta Rotterdam) grew up playing 'Total Football' While Cruyff dismisses Van Gaal as a control freak he eulogises about Buckingham, who at the start of the Seventies was manager of Barcelona (yes, really), the club where Cruyff would star as a player then a coach, laying down the foundations of the mighty team we have seen in recent years. But Barca even in this ‘modern era’ (as if men like Buckingham were not ‘modern’ in their day ) play four at the back, although their shape like great rivals Real Madrid is a 4-3-3. In short it’s the surest way of defending across the width of the pitch. If you have attacking full backs in that system then you have to have one or perhaps two midfielders who are prepared to hold. That’s also known as flexibility. Of course it is naive to label and pigeon-hole formations. At any given time of a game you will see one shape morphing into another. But even the best teams need a starting shape. Holland's formation in the 1974 World Cup was a fluid 3-4-3, with Cruyff the star man up front . Holland are an exception, as since then nearly every great side have succeeded with four at the back . Essentially the great Brazil team of 1970 was 4-4-2. But with so many great players and great movement the front six was more a carousel than a system. There is another irony here: at international tournaments since 1966 England have performed better when ditching 4-4-2. In 1990 under Bobby Robson and then France 98 under Glenn Hoddle England played with 3-5-2 sweeper system, more like Germany of those days, and did well. Although Terry Venables’s ‘christmas tree’ system at Euro 96 had a back four it was a long way from rigid straight lines of 4-4-2 that can limit a team and even promote the long ball as it did in Graham Taylor’s England. But, as wise managers will say, the bottom line is identifying what shape suits your players best. Generally the better players a manager has, the better his team will be. Brazil's side from 1970 are one of the best in history and played 4-4-2 - though the front six moved freely . That is not the case if the players are shoehorned into a game plan that doesn’t suit them individually or collectively. For a while at Swindon and then Chelsea, Hoddle saw some success with 3-5-2. Harry Redknapp has used the system with various teams from time to time. Howard Wilkinson did so at Notts County and then Sheffield Wednesday. But they are exceptions and not the rule. Under Sir Alex Ferguson, Manchester United enjoyed season after season of success using 4-4-2, often with a twist, which usually saw the second striker operate as a No 10. The rest of Fergie’s tactics were pretty straightforward: a back four, two central midfielders working in tandem (one ‘sticks’ if the other ‘twists’), two attacking wide men, an ‘inside forward’ and a centre forward. Glenn Hoddle was a believer in 3-5-2 and had some success with England but this seems to be an exception . Yet 4-4-2 gives Van Gaal a twitchy ass? The Dutchman says it affects the balance of the team. Perhaps that’s because he has got the balance of his squad wrong. Either 3-5-2 or 3-4-3 just doesn’t seem to get the best of the talent he has at his disposal. As Gary Neville says it slows the team down too much. The only time Fergie said he had a ‘twitchy ass’ - aka ‘squeaky bum time’ - was during the run-in for the title. It’s a position clipboard-toting Van Gaal won’t in this season. Whether he likes it or not, history proves that four at the back is the key to success in the Premier League. Sir Alex Ferguson stuck to 4-4-2, and reaped the rewards over 26 years at Old Trafford . Manchester United always had a dangerous front two, while midfielders covered several roles . The system got the best out of stars such as Paul Scholes (left), Roy Keane (centre) and Ryan Giggs (right)","Louis van Gaal said he had a 'twitchy ass' watching his side play 4-4-2 .

"Swansea City completed the signing of Tottenham full back Kyle Naughton on a three-and-a-half-year contract on Thursday. The 26-year-old passed a medical and agreed personal terms in south Wales on Wednesday, before the club announced the deal on Thursday afternoon. The transfer fee for the right back was marginally under £5million. Naughton told Swansea's official website: 'I'm pleased it's all done because there has been talk since the summer over a potential move. 'My main aim is to start playing regular football again. I know it's going to be a tough challenge because there are some very good players here, but that's my goal. Kyle Naughton completed his £5m move from Tottenham to Swansea on Thursday . Naughton passed a medical on Wednesday before completing his switch to the south Wales club . 'I've had quite a few loan moves over my career, but I actually played 34 games last season for Spurs, which is a fair amount. The main problem for me, however, was that I was still in and out of the team. That's difficult at times. 'I'm sad to be leaving Spurs because it's a great club. I was there quite a while and the lads are a great bunch. But now I just want to settle into life at Swansea and try to play regularly. It all comes down to playing football – after all, that's my job.' Swansea could yet do more business with Spurs in this window, having been quoted £5m for Tom Carroll, who is on loan at the Liberty Stadium. The Swans could also be in the market for Tottenham's Tom Carroll (right) who is currently on loan at the club . Having signed promising central midfielder Matt Grimes from Exeter, Garry Monk is weighing up whether to move for a player who occupies the same position. Naughton played in only five games for Mauricio Pochettino this season and was told he was no longer needed. Monk has been won over by his ability to play on either side of defence, with Swansea keen to strengthen at both left and right back. Swansea's existing left back Neil Taylor has struggled to fill the void left by Ben Davies' summer departure for Tottenham and is a target for Crystal Palace. Meanwhile, long-serving right-back Angel Rangel is 32 and there were doubts last months over his ability to play three games in a week. An offer has gone in for Norwich left-back Martin Olsson.

"There has been no bigger beneficiary from Alastair Cook’s demise as England one-day captain than Ian Bell who has stepped up from the Sri Lankan sidelines to become a thoroughly modern World Cup opener in a couple of easy strides. Bell’s participation in the biggest tournament in one-day cricket was in doubt when he was left out after two matches of England’s tour of Sri Lanka but the late switch away from Cook gave him a lifeline he has gratefully seized. Now after following up his 187 in a warm-up match in Canberra with a dreamy unbeaten 88 against India he can reflect on a dramatic switch in one-day fortunes that sees him with one final chance of making a World Cup impact. Ian Bell enjoys an England training session ahead of Friday's clash with Australia . ‘I still thought I would get on the trip,’ insisted Bell as he reflected on his pre-Christmas plight ahead of Friday’s Tri-series game against Australia. ‘I’m someone with experience who can play in a variety of roles. But I probably didn’t expect to be in this position. ‘When I spoke to Eoin Morgan out here and he said he wanted me to open it was a massive confidence boost. Looking back, my most successful time in one-day cricket came in the two years I opened so I wanted to get back to that.’ His elevation, which was proposed by the England coaches and then endorsed by new captain Morgan, was interpreted by many as a reflection of the ‘old-fashioned’ tactics that had held England back in the limited-overs game. Yet the coaches still had reservations about Alex Hales' technique and wanted to continue with their original game-plan of having a ‘proper’ batsman at the top of the order to try to bat through the 50 overs. Cook ran out of chances to show he was in good enough form to fulfil the brief so Bell has been able to step up. England’s classiest Test batsman is clear on his role. ‘Moeen Ali has come out and had a really good go at the bowlers and I want to be similar to that,’ said Bell. ‘Maybe it will be in a slightly different style, a bit more orthodox, but the important thing is recognising the surface you’re on and putting your foot down if it’s flat or getting through it if it’s doing a bit.’ Bell leaves the field after England's impressive victory over India in which he hit an unbeaten 88 . If England are going to make an impact in the World Cup then they will have to post scores of 300 plus with at least one batsman making the big century or even double hundred that are becoming common place in one-day cricket. Bell is convinced he can deliver the goods. ‘Opening the batting in those first 10 overs suits my game, certainly in these conditions when there’s more bounce and you can play off the back foot or hit it over the field. ‘I’ve tried to work hard even in Sri Lanka when I wasn’t playing. When you play for England you always try to get better and not stand still. This game is changing all the time and you have to go with that or you get left behind. ‘I wouldn’t say I’ve changed anything dramatically. I wouldn’t say that anything I did the other night or in Canberra was any different. It’s just we’ve given a lot of thought over the last few months as to what we want to do here and it’s about executing that now. There are certain areas we’ve identified.’ Bell plays a shot past India's bowler Stuart Binny during their one-day  clash . It would be a huge boost for England if they could execute those plans against Australia at the Bellerive Oval and they will never have a better chance to end their dismal run of results here as the hosts are missing key players. Shane Watson became the latest Australian to pull out through injury and he joins Mitchell Johnson, David Warner and George Bailey on the sidelines. Bell was out first ball to the pace of Mitchell Starc when Australia won in Sydney at the start of this warm-up Tri-series and knows he has to succeed against them if he is to truly establish himself among the leading openers here. ‘I didn’t spend enough time at the crease to lose form,’ said Bell of his golden duck. ‘It was disappointing but those opening 10 overs from Australia were world-class. We have to start well now. It would be good to do it against Australia and kick on from there.’","Ian Bell has seized his chance after Alastair Cook was axed as captain .

"Johan Cruyff has given a damming verdict of the Ballon d'Or and described Cristiano Ronaldo's last two titles as 'absurd'. But the Barcelona icon is not dismayed at the Portuguese attacker's victories because of his affiliation with Real Madrid, as Cruyff is adamant Ronaldo's club team-mate Toni Kroos should have taken the award. The 67-year-old hailed Kroos' achievements with Bayern Munich in 2013, where  Pep Guardiola's side cruised to league victory by 25 points, before lauding him for his attacking displays at the 2014 World Cup in Brazil, a tournament he said Ronaldo was 'invisible' in. Cristiano Ronaldo should not have won the Ballon d'Or, according to Johan Cruyff . Cruyff believes that Toni Kroos was a much better candidate to take the award . Kroos poses with the World Cup he helped Germany to win in Brazil in 2014 . 'At the highest level, it's a combination of individual talent and titles,' Cruyff told Dutch newspaper De Telegraaf. 'From this point of view, it is absurd that, for the second consecutive year, the prize has been given to a player who has not played excellently [at a major tournament] or won the most titles. 'In 2013, Bayern Munich won everything there was to win, and yet Cristiano Ronaldo won the award instead of Toni Kroos or any other Bayern player. 'In 2014, Kroos was again decisive in the team that won the World Cup, and yet he was not in the three finalists. Ronaldo was invisible in the World Cup. 'I just cannot take this FIFA award seriously.' Kroos, who moved to Madrid after his World Cup triumph, was named in the FIFA World XI alongside Madrid team-mates Ronaldo and Sergio Ramos. Toni Kroos (right) poses with his Real Madrid counterparts after being named in the FIFA World XI . Cruyff won the Ballon d'Or three times himself in 1971, 73 and 74. Despite Ronaldo continuing his relentless scoring record and won the Champions League, the Dutchman believes these feats are not as significant as Kroos' impact at the World Cup. Kroos shone in all seven appearances in the tournament for Germany and scored twice in the 7-1 semi-final victory over hosts Brazil.","Dutch legend Johan Cruyff says he 'cannot this FIFA award seriously'

"Real Madrid talisman Cristiano Ronaldo has claimed he was the obvious choice after winning his second successive Ballon d’Or title earlier this month. The 29-year-old beat Bayern Munich keeper Manuel Neuer and rival Lionel Messi to the prestigious award after a stellar 12 months with 56 goals in 51 Real Madrid games.

But I deserved it last year too, given the amount of goals I scored. ‘The other two candidates this year, Messi and Neuer, were also great winners, but my victory is deserved.

"After Cristiano Ronaldo caused a stir  by letting out a scream in celebration after winning the Ballon d'Or, the Real Madrid forward has taken to greeting fans in the same way. The Portugal international was stopped in the street by an elderly supporter looking to have his picture taken with the star, before the pair let out the iconic scream in each other's direction. Ronaldo explained after the Ballon d'Or ceremony that the celebration was one that he often performs in training with his Real Madrid team-mates. After posing for a picture with the fan they shared a celebratory scream together . The supporter screamed back in Ronaldo's direction as the forward walked off . 'The scream? The players know I always do that shout when I score a goal or when we win - it's our team shout,' Ronaldo told a Spanish TV station. It was later revealed that Ronaldo was shouting 'Siiiii' and the forward now uses the scream to celebrate all his goals.

"An unfortunate ball boy was left winded and wincing after being struck in the groin by a Feliciano Lopez serve during the Spaniard's second-round match with Frenchman Adrian Mannarino at the Australian Open. Lopez had served at an estimated speed of 200km/h and the ball boy had no chance to move out of the way.

"A partnership that had helped fashion British sporting history came to an end on a chilly November day at Andy Murray’s house in Surrey. Dani Vallverdu had gone for a chat with the friend he met as a young teenager at Barcelona tennis academy and whom he assisted to the US Open, Olympic and Wimbledon titles. Five years of living out of each other’s pockets was over. ‘We sat and talked for a few hours and that was it, a calm conversation,’ said Vallverdu, speaking for the first time about his exit from Team Murray following the Barclays ATP World Tour Finals. Andy Murray looks to the sky as he books his place in the last 32 of the Australian Open on Wednesday . Murray celebrates his 2012 US Open win with Dani Vallverdu, Jez Green (second right) and Andy Ireland (right) ‘Our professional relationship had run its course. Maybe it had become a bit stale. I thought it was the right time to part. There are no hard feelings but now I have to focus on my career, trying to help Tomas Berdych achieve his goals.’ Vallverdu’s new charge, the world No 7, was in Australian Open action  against Serbia’s Viktor Troicki, while Murray faced Joao Sousa of Portugal. ‘Andy and I have been friends for nearly 15 years,’ continued Vallverdu. ‘Our personal relationship is still good, I consider him one of my best friends and I’ll always be in his corner, except for when I am coaching against him.’ Vallverdu, part of a hugely successful coaching duo with Ivan Lendl, scotches suggestions he and Murray had a big fall-out and that he did not get on with Amelie Mauresmo. He predicts the Scot will win more Grand Slams. If there is a source of contention it is Murray’s pointed, recently repeated assertions that his team were not all ‘pulling in the same direction’ in the last few months. There certainly seem to have been technical disagreements about the type of fitness regimes favoured by trainer Jez Green, who also left in November, but it is news to Vallverdu that there was a split in the camp. Vallverdu had been part of Murray's team for over a decade after they met as juniors in Barcelona . ‘We were all pulling in the same direction,’ he says. ‘I’m quite proud of how we pulled it around after the US Open. It was pretty hard, him qualifying for London from his position after New York. Of course Andy is the one who played the matches but everyone had the goal of helping him get there. I don’t think the last four months are a reason we aren’t working together any more, it was genuinely mutual. ‘His determination, professionalism and stubbornness, that’s what has made him so successful but, because of the way he is, it gets to the point when it is time for both parties to go their own ways.’ Few know Murray better than Vallverdu, a soft-spoken Venezuelan who smilingly describes himself as ‘28, but with an old soul’. He worked with Murray from early 2010, travelling non-stop and becoming the perfect foil for the uncompromising Lendl, who rarely wasted a chance to extol the South American’s understated contribution. There was undoubtedly some hurt when Murray sought Mauresmo’s services at the French Open without telling his inner circle first, but Vallverdu flattens widely-held assertions that he could not work with her. ‘We had a great relationship and I learned a great deal from her,’ he says. ‘She went through a lot as a player and it’s great to spend any time with legends of the game. It will only make me a better coach. I think she is going to be very good for Andy, they have the same ideas about how to move forward and win Slams.’ Vallverdu has taken over coaching World No 7 Tomas Berdych, with the Czech playing at the Australian Open . Murray, at the 2014 Roland Garros, split with Dani Vallverdu (right) from his coaching staff in November . Vallverdu’s standing in Lendl’s eyes was such that when Berdych approached his compatriot about coaching — and Lendl declined due to the family and wider commitments that caused him to leave Murray last March — he was quick to recommend the Venezuelan. ‘Ivan was a great mentor. Inside and outside of the court he is a great person and taught me a lot,’ said Vallverdu. Relationships between coaches and players are intense enough in tennis, even without a deep friendship mixed in. Not all end amicably. Vallverdu acknowledges it has been ‘a bit weird’ being here in an opposite camp to Murray. ‘It was always going to be strange. The first day I got here he was hitting on the Rod Laver Arena with James Ward and I gave him a big hug and said hello. I am close friends with the rest of the team, they will be friends for the rest of my life. ‘Andy and I haven’t spent much time together in the last few months and that’s very unusual. The more time we spend together like this the more normal it will become. Murray, practising ahead of his third round clash in Australia, with his coach Amelie Mauresmo . ‘I’ll always be extremely grateful for the opportunity he gave me and the trust he put in me. We achieved some great things together. There were rough patches too, but most were good. ‘The team was all pulling together, there were no egos. It was always all about Andy, how we can make him better and achieve his goals. We tried to make him the best he could be. ‘The most joy for me was his Olympics win and seeing him presented with the gold medal. It was very special because it was in his own country on Centre Court against Roger Federer. ‘I feel it was a big moment for him to define his career. Getting over that hurdle I really think helped him win the US Open and Wimbledon. It added self-belief. ‘I think Andy will win Slams again, he still has the hunger and he is a special talent and competitor.’ Vallverdu’s task now is to coax a first Major out of Berdych, who came closest when he reached the Wimbledon 2010 final. ‘I was going to take a bit of time out but it’s a great opportunity and the first few weeks have been good,’ he says. ‘Tomas is a good guy with a lot of talent who works hard.’ Vallverdu at Wimbledon (left) with Ivan Lendl and Jez Green, who have all departed Murray's set up .

"Eugenie Bouchard and Serena Williams were reluctant to discuss suggestions of sexism at the Australian Open after a male on-court interviewer sparked outrage by asking some female players to 'give a twirl'. However Williams, the world No 1, acknowledged that leading men's players would never be asked to do the same in post-match TV interviews. Both Williams and Canada's Bouchard were asked to spin around to show off their outfits during on-court interviews in Melbourne, prompting an angry response on social media and accusations of sexism levelled at Tennis Australia commentator Ian Cohen, who made the request.

"Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers believes his summer signings are finally emerging from an adaptation period and showing signs they can be a success at the club. Forward Lazar Markovic was first to shine with a number of impressive cameos, culminating in the 20-year-old's maiden league goal since a £20million move from Benfica against Sunderland last weekend. Emre Can, whose disappointing first half of the season was disrupted by injury, has found a position for himself on the right side of a back three but has shown his versatility with occasional roles in midfield. Lazar Markovic (left) is put through his paces by Liverpool head of fitness Ryland Morgan on Thursday . Markovic has impressed in recent weeks for Liverpool after a slow starting following his £20m move . Markovic (centre) scored his first league goal for Liverpool in the 1-0 win over Sunderland . The German, who turned 21 this week, is a product of Bayern Munich's youth system and arrived in a £10m deal with high expectations after one season at Bayer Leverkusen. Rodgers believes keen Liverpool watchers are only now starting to see his potential. 'He will need a bit of time moving to a new country as a young player,' said Rodgers. 'You have to remember he had only one full year of playing even though he had come through the system at Bayern Munich. 'I think he has shown his value and I think there is no doubt he will prove to be a real bargain for us. 'It was a lot of money for a young player but he is a wonderful talent, great footballer, his stature and power is well suited to the Premier League, he is two-footed, has great balance and good aggression in his game and for me is multi-functional. 'He will prove to be a player who can play in a number of positions very well here and as you have seen since he came in here he has been outstanding. Emre Can (left) holds off Jose Enrique as Liverpool train on Thursday . Brendan Rodgers has backed Can (right) to be a success at Liverpool . Can showed his versatility against Sunderland, filling in in three position for Liverpool . Twitter account @Awaydays23 posted a picture of a flag of Steven Gerrard . 'He actually played in three positions against Sunderland: he started on the right side of a back three, we moved him up to play in the top of the midfield box and then put him back into a wide midfield role. 'It was one of the reasons we brought him here. He is a footballer and sometimes you find the very best footballers can play in any position and they are capable of working the game out.' Versatility is often more of a curse than a blessing, as team-mate Jordan Henderson discovered in 2011 when he arrived from Sunderland as a 21-year-old with a £16m price tag to justify. However, Can believes in his case it will prove to be a blessing. 'It has always been the case that I have played in different positions,' he told liverpoolfc.com. 'It's an advantage for the team to have a player like that and it's an advantage for me personally as well. 'My favourite position is central midfield and the manager knows that but if I get a chance to play and help the team I will happily play at the back. 'I think I've performed well and shown what I can do, but I need to keep on improving, and I hope I get a lot more games.' Rodgers spent £120m in the summer and most of his signings have come in for criticism in one form or another after failing to hit the ground running. Dejan Lovren (centre) has come underfire for his performances since his £20m move from Southampton . Lovren (left) is another player who Rodgers believes will come good in time for Liverpool . Dejan Lovren was brought in to be the new linchpin of the defence but struggled with the expectation on his shoulders and the 25-year-old has been sidelined in recent weeks, but even he earned a vote of confidence from Rodgers. 'Dejan will prove in his time he is as very good player,' Rodgers added. 'You have seen it over many years at the big clubs; some players will settle in straight away and some take a bit of time. 'He is still very young for a central defender but he will prove to be an outstanding player. 'This whole year's experience for him as a Liverpool player will benefit him and over the coming months and years he will show what a top player he is.' Liverpool, still short of goals, head on Saturday to Aston Villa who despite their apparent struggles have conceded just 23 goals in 21 matches and only 11 in 10 at home. Villa won 1-0 at Anfield in September. 'They are a tough team to break down. They may not have scored a lot of goals, which has been highlighted, but they don't concede many either,' said Rodgers. 'We had a difficult game against them earlier in the season where we conceded from a sloppy corner and just couldn't make the breakthrough. 'But we are on the back of four wins away from home and there is good momentum and confidence in the team.'","Liverpool transfer news: Divock Origi could be called back this month .

"Real Madrid should have Croatia midfielder Luka Modric back from injury in a month's time, manager Carlo Ancelotti said on Sunday. Modric damaged a thigh muscle in a Euro 2016 qualifier against Italy in November and his place in the Real starting lineup has been filled by Spain playmaker Isco. While Isco has performed admirably and is a favourite with the Real fans, Modric's return will be a welcome boost and his reliable presence adds an extra level of control.

Real's easy victory at the Alfonso Perez Coliseum - thanks to a Cristiano Ronaldo double either side of a Gareth Bale strike - put them four points clear of second-placed Barcelona, who play at Deportivo La Coruna later on Sunday.

"Cristiano Ronaldo rewrote another page of the Real Madrid record book with two of the three goals that helped give his team a 3-0 win over Getafe. Nobody in the club’s history has scored more league goals away from home than Ronaldo, who netted what were his 27th and 28th league goals of the season. With Gareth Bale also scoring Real Madrid were comfortable winners despite reaching the break not having scored in the first half for the first time this season. The magnitude of Ronaldo’s record is best appreciated in comparison with the man whose record he overtakes. Former captain and club legend Raul scored 87 goals away from home in the league in 271 matches. Ronaldo has scored 89 in 92 games.

Subs not used: Navas, Hernandez, Jese, Medran. Scorers: Ronaldo (63, 79), Bale (67). Booked: Kroos, Rodriguez. Att: 11500. If the second half was all smiles and broken records the first was tough going for Madrid. The midday start meant directors from both sides had to replace the usual pre-match lunch or dinner with a breakfast at the club’s Alfonso Perez Coliseum and Real made a sleepy start to the game. They took half an hour to muster their first real chance with James Rodriguez’ shot charged down after he was found with a Karim Benzema cross. The Frenchman was then fed by Bale but failed to beat Jordi Codina in the Getafe goal. The former Real Madrid youth team keeper also saved from Bale as the home side frustrated Real. Getafe have taken 19 points of off Madrid in the last 10 years. Only five La Liga teams have a better record and true to form they made the first 45 minutes tough going for Carlo Ancelotti’s leaders. They might even had led after Pablo Sarabia – another former Real Madrid youth team player – raced away to feed Jorge Sammir only for the Brazilian-born Croatian to miss the chance. Madrid were missing a Croatian of their own. Luka Modric will be out for another month and Real are starting to really missing his invention. Toni Kroos is doing his best without him and it was his rasping left-foot shot that rattled the crossbar in the last piece of action of the first half. In the second period Codina continued to frustrate his former club, saving from Isco who shot from distance. Madrid were being reduced to long shots until Benzema finally found a way through. The Frenchman hasn’t scored for Madrid since November but nobody is panicking because everyone at the club knows how important his overall play is. He dribbled his way to the byline, lifted his head and found Ronaldo who had found space on the edge of the six-yard box with not a single blue-shirted player tracking his run. Within two minutes the lead was doubled. This time it was Rodriguez who crossed from the left and Bale cutting in from the right stabbed the ball home with the outside of his left foot. The Welshman hobbled off in injury time after a kick on the calf from Emiliano Valazquez but he will be happy with what was another effective display. Getafe hit the post late on but fell further behind when Ronaldo got his second. Rodriguez again loaded the bullets this time for the Portuguese to jump between two defenders and bullet a header past Codina. It was the third goal of a game already won but he celebrated it in his customary fashion – scoring for fun has never been so apt.

"Liverpool forward Raheem Sterling has revealed he is 'enjoying learning to adapt' playing in a more central role following his magnificent solo goal against Chelsea. The 20-year-old ghosted past Nemanja Matic and Gary Cahill on his way to netting a brilliant individual goal past Blues goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois during the Capital One Cup semi-final first leg on Tuesday night. Sterling was deployed in a central role up top by Brendan Rodgers against Chelsea, as he has been in recent weeks, and the England international has started to thrive with the added responsibility. Raheem Sterling's superb second-half strike means Liverpool's semi-final is firmly poised . Sterling watches on as his shot evades Thibaut Courtois and nestles into the far corner . The 20-year-old celebrates his goal with Liverpool team-mate Jordan Henderson and Philippe Coutinho . And the challenges of adapting to the 3-4-2-1 formation employed by Rodgers have excited Sterling in recent weeks. He told the Liverpool Echo: 'It's a role that I am learning and adapting to, but if you want to be a good player, it is something you've got to do, you've got to adapt and play in different positions. 'I want to learn as much as I can, and I'm enjoying it at the moment. It's good for me.' Chelsea went ahead at Anfield when Eden Hazard converted from the spot following a foul by Emre Can on the Belgian forward. But Sterling's memorable solo strike ensured Liverpool head to Stamford Bridge for next week's second leg all square in the tie at 1-1 - although the Reds could and probably should be visiting west London with a lead. Eden Hazard  put the Blues ahead from the penalty spot before the break . And the England forward is hoping he can continue playing up top with such responsibility next week. Sterling continued: 'I want to get on the ball as much as possible. As long as it's not too high in the air, I will fight for it and try to make something happen. 'It's good to play with players like Adam (Lallana) and Philippe (Coutinho) who like to get on the ball and try to create for you. I enjoy being on the receiving end of their great play and trying to finish off the chances they create.' Brendan Rodgers and Jose Mourinho shake hands at the final whistle after the 1-1 draw at Anfield .","Raheem Sterling scored brilliant solo goal against Chelsea on Tuesday .

"Raheem Sterling's driving run saw him equalise for Liverpool after the break - click here for our brilliant matchzone service . It was what one might call a Michael Owen moment. Maybe a Jimmy Greaves moment for those whose memory extends to football's golden age. Raheem Sterling turned and ran, straight at the heart of the Chelsea defence. You know, like the great goalscorers do. In that instant of pure athletic acceleration nobody could live with him. Not Nemanja Matic, the stand-out defensive midfield player of this season, not Gary Cahill who appeared to be plodding through quick-drying cement by comparison. Sterling, having dropped deep to receive the pass, was reaching top gear as he arrived in the penalty area, yet he didn't look at all hurried. As Thibaut Courtois began his advance he slipped the ball smartly past him and into the far corner. It was a gem of a goal, worthy of winning any match. That it only achieved parity for Liverpool is testament to Chelsea's defensive resilience. It was going to take something exceptional to breach that defence, and Sterling provided it. Credit, also, to his manager Brendan Rodgers. After the Christmas and New Year fixtures he gave Sterling time off to recharge his batteries, as promised. Sterling was pictured holidaying in Jamaica. Some mocked. Who do they think they are these softy footballers, unable to play a full season without taking off to the Caribbean? And how foolish is that mug of a manager to fall for it? Yet Sterling played as if revived. Eden Hazard comfortably stroked home a penalty in the 18th minute to give Chelsea the lead against Liverpool on Tuesday night . Raheem Sterling celebrates after scoring a superb equaliser for the hosts in the 59th minute in the Capital One Cup semi-final . Liverpool: Mingolet 6.5; Can 6, Skrtel 7, Sakho 7; Henderson 7, Gerrard 8 (Lallana 70), Lucas 7, Moreno 7; Markovic 6.5, Sterling 8, Coutinho 7.5 . Subs not used: Ward, Enrique, Lambert, Manquillo, Borini, Rossiter . Goal: Sterling 59 . Booked: Gerrard, Lucas . Chelsea: Courtois 8.5; Ivanovic 7, Cahill 6, Terry 7, Luis 6 ; Matic 6.5, Mikel 5.5; Hazard 7, Fabregas 7, Willian 7 (Azpilicueta 87); Costa 6 . Subs not used: Cech, Zouma, Ramires, Oscar, Remy, Drogba . Goal: Hazard 18 (pen) Booked: Luis, Mikel . Referee: Martin Atkinson . Att: 44,573 . He was a proper handful, buzzing around Chelsea's back line, desperately trying to make up for the absence of a genuine striker in Liverpool's ranks. With Daniel Sturridge still missing it speaks volumes that Rodgers prefers Sterling to either Rickie Lambert or Mario Balotelli. Certainly it is hard to imagine either of his rivals scoring a goal of that quality on current form. Just like Sterling's trip to Jamaica, that was a bold managerial move. It would have been very easy for Mourinho to keep Petr Cech in goal for one last game - particularly as this competition is regarded as the least important of Chelsea's quartet of campaigns. Instead, Courtois was recalled immediately, and was superb in keeping Liverpool at bay. He saved from Philippe Coutinho in the 67th minute, from Jordan Henderson after 75 minutes and from Sterling again when he tried to capitalise on the rebound a second later. True, Courtois rode his luck when, in gathering the ball under pressure from Sterling, he began to slide out of his area and regained control only with his elbow. It should have been a free-kick for handling, and in a dangerous area just outside the box, but referee Martin Atkinson waved it away. Moments later, the Belgian made amends with a quite magnificent stop from Sterling. Without him, this match could have got away from Chelsea. They will most certainly have felt greatly relieved when Steven Gerrard shot against the post after 66 minutes. Coutinho set him up and the goal was open in front of The Kop. Perhaps he tried to place it too perfectly. With the momentum of a Gerrard goal at the right end, Liverpool's head of steam may have proved unstoppable. Gerrard was taken off soon after, no doubt with mixed emotions. He had more than played his part in Liverpool's comeback but that miss will have weighed heavily. It will be all about him again at Stamford Bridge, too, with Chelsea's travelling contingent ignoring Mourinho's plea to show respect for a great player.

Hazard proved a menace throughout - here attempting to dart away from Liverpool's main central defender Martin Skrtel . The game hadn't even kicked off when the blue corner began taunting Liverpool's captain about the famous slip. The home fans immediately replied with their tribute and at one point in the first half the entire ground was singing Gerrard's name, with levels of appreciation at opposite extremes. Gerrard has heard it all before, of course, and as expected no man did more to try to get Liverpool's noses in front. This being his last season at Anfield there is almost an entire area of The Kop reserved for Gerrard-related banners. 'The best there is, the best there was and the best there ever will be,' said the largest, and most poetic - although it's a depressing thought if the best Liverpool will ever have retires without a league championship winners medal. A more attainable ambition was contained in the message 'Get Gerrard to Wembley'. As usual, though, if you want anything done properly do it yourself, and in the first half at least the duties of propelling Liverpool forward fell to the usual suspect again. It was Gerrard who forced the only two saves from Courtois in the first half, Gerrard who was involved in just about every Liverpool move that was memorable or incisive. A fierce shot, 35 yards out, demanded the first stop of the game, then, when Gary Cahill fouled Sterling on the left, it was Gerrard who curled a vicious free-kick in from a tight angle, bringing Courtois into action once more.

Oscar clearly felt the need to keep himself warm on the substitutes' bench - pictured clutching a hot water bottle . Mourinho shakes the hand of Gerrard after the central midfielder was replaced by Adam Lallana in the 70th minute . That he did this in front of Chelsea’s mocking fans made the attempt all the more ambitious. Every neutral must have secretly wished for the perfect retort. The effect of his absence next season is close to incalculable. Chelsea, by contrast, had one first-half chance, and took it - from the penalty spot. Cesc Fabregas played the ball inside to Eden Hazard, who was bundled over clumsily by Emre Can. Atkinson had no doubt and Hazard stepped up to capitalise on his work. Belgian against Belgian, he sent Simon Mignolet the wrong way, planting the ball low to the right. Liverpool will claim the award was soft, but they won’t have much of a case. Can took a chance stepping into Hazard; a penalty the likely outcome. Knowing what we know of Chelsea it was always a foolhardy move. Goals like Sterling’s come rarely, Chelsea nick results like this in their sleep.","Eden Hazard gave Chelsea an 18th-minute lead from the spot after Emre Can had fouled the Belgian in the box .

"Carlo Ancelotti is widely acknowledged as one of the most successful names in world football. The Real Madrid manager represented Italy at the 1990 World Cup, captained Roma during an eight-year spell at Stadio Olimpico, before turning his hand to management and excelling at that too. And now the 55-year-old has been rewarded with a place in the Italian Football Hall of Fame. Carlo Ancelotti poses with his shirt from Italia 90, which he is donating to the Football Museum in Italy . Ancelotti was inducted into the Italian Football Hall of Fame on Monday after a remarkable career to date . His career began in 1976 - 39 years ago - in the youth ranks of Parma, before he earned a move to Roma in 1979. Eight years there, followed by five at AC Milan; Ancelotti is truly a stalwart of Italian football. He made 26 appearances for his national team, culminating in a place in the World Cup squad on home soil at Italia 90. Ancelotti will donate his shirt from that tournament to the Football Museum 'as a token of my appreciation.' Moving into management, Ancelotti has taken charge of some of the biggest football clubs in the world; Parma (his first professional club), Juventus, AC Milan, Chelsea, Paris St Germain, and latterly Real Madrid, where his team have been hailed as the best there is.

"Australian Robert Allenby has elected to skip this week's Humana Challenge following the incident in Hawaii in which he reported being kidnapped, beaten and robbed. The 43-year-old has said he has 'no recollection' of events that unfolded last Friday after he missed the cut at the Sony Open and spent the evening in a wine bar. Allenby has explained that he was found unconscious six miles away in a park with significant facial injuries and missing his wallet, mobile phone, cash and credit cards. Australian golfer Robert Allenby was allegedly kidnapped from a bar, robbed and beaten up in Hawaii . Allenby says he was dumped about six miles away from the bar he had been drinking in . The Australian failed to make the cut after the first two days of play and was relaxing on Friday night . Rather than immediately return to work at the tour event in La Quinta, California, Allenby believes he would be wise to step away, having taken medical advice. He said in a statement released by the PGA Tour: 'On the advice of my personal doctor, I have decided to withdraw from this week's Humana Challenge. This will enable me to ensure I am fully recovered prior to rejoining the PGA Tour. I anticipate a full recovery and look forward to returning in the near future.

'I have a great relationship with him. It's great that he joined Bayern. He already won a lot at Barcelona and took his qualities with him to Bayern. We learned a lot in his first season here. 'Things are going even better now we fully understand him. He is a great coach who tries new things all the time.

"Atletico Madrid beat Arsenal in the UEFA Youth League on Tuesday to move into the competition’s quarter-finals but the club’s recruitment policy has been placed under the spotlight with FIFA investigating their underage signings. Barcelona have already been banned from making signings this year because of irregularities in nine underage signings and Real Madrid have had to supply documentation for around 50 boys signed over the last six years. None of those involved in Atletico’s 1-0 win over Arsenal are under investigation but FIFA do want Atletico to cooperate with their enquiries. Daniel Crowley of Arsenal (left) takes on Atletico Madrid's Mendiondo on Tuesday night . Amath Diedhiou (left, pictured competing with Tyrell Robinson) scored the only goal of the game in Spain . The Spanish champions have the largest number of overseas players in their youth system in Spain’s top flight with 43 players from 26 different nationalities. Twenty one of those are understood to be underage and, according to Diario AS, the group include 10-year-olds from Brazil, Ethiopia and Guinea. The club also has an agreement with the ministry of sport in China and the Chinese conglomerate Wanda which involves around 20 youngsters being sent to Madrid every year to attend Atletico’s academy. Villarreal and Valencia have a similar agreement but are not believed to be under investigation by Fifa. Barcelona were banned for contravening Article 19 last year. Under 18s signed from outside the EU must have moved to the city of the club in question for non-football reasons. Barcelona never denied having failed to follow the rules and instead argued for a change in the rules. Barcelona president Josep Bartomeu said on Tuesday: ‘I do not want other clubs punished I want FIFA to rethink the regulations.’ Atletico Madrid have more foreign youth team players (43) than any other side in Spain's top flight .

"Australian golfer Robert Allenby has recalled his terrifying ordeal after he was kidnapped, beaten and robbed in Honolulu on Friday night, saying he feels lucky to be alive. Allenby was at the popular Amuse Wine Bar in the tourist-laden Waikiki with his close friend Anthony Puntoriero after missing the cut at the Sony Open - and isn't sure whether he'll be able to compete in next week's Humana Challenge . The 43-year-old believes the suspects may have drugged him before he was taken to an underground car park where he was knocked out, robbed and thrown into the boot of a car. Scroll down for video . Australian golfer Robert Allenby was kidnapped from a bar, robbed and beaten up in Hawaii . Allenby, 43, was in the country playing the Sony Open but missed the cut on Friday . The golfer was drinking at Amuse Wine Bar about five miles from his hotel when he was kidnapped . 'Medically, I thankfully didn't suffer anything major beyond some bumps and bruises that will take a bit of time to heal,' Allenby said in a statement released by the PGA Tour on Sunday. 'My plan currently is to fly back to the mainland and at that point, evaluate my ability to play next week at the Humana Challenge. 'Whatever the outcome regarding my ability to play next week, I anticipate a successful rest of the 2014-15 PGA Tour season.' Allenby has noticeable damage and lacerations to his nose and forehead. 'I didn't think I was going to survive this one,' Allenby said earlier on Sunday. 'I was separated from my friend in the bar after we had paid the tab at 10:48pm and he went to the bathroom and next thing you know I'm being dumped in a park miles away. 'I only know this part because a homeless woman found me and told me she saw a few guys pull up and throw me out of the car. That is where I got the scrapes above my eye from the sidewalk.' A map showing the wine bar Allenby was drinking in, the golf course and his hotel in Hawaii . A picture of the inside of the Amuse Wine Bar where Allenby was drinking before he was attacked . Shaken and in a bad way Allenby realised he was without his phone, wallet or any cash and was starting to be harassed by other homeless people in the park. 'The homeless woman got me away from the others and then a retired military guy walking past came to my aid,' he said. 'He got me into a taxi and paid for me to get to my hotel and I called police from there. I have his details and will be getting back in touch with him for sure.' The Sony Open was held at the Waialae Country Club and Allenby was staying at the nearby Kahala Hotel . The Australian failed to make the cut after the first two days of play and was relaxing on Friday night . Born: 12 July, 1971 . Turned pro: 1992 . Joined PGA Tour: 1999 . Best major results: Equal seventh, U.S. Open (2004), The Open Championship (2008) Best Australian PGA result:2005 'triple crown', winning the Australian Masters, Open and PGA . Earnings: Allenby is 27th on the all-time list for the PGA Tour with $27,329,892 . The four-time PGA Tour winner has been assisting police and PGA Tour FBI officials with inquiries. 'We have some names and numbers and they have some leads to follow up, so I am confident they will get the guys,' Allenby said. 'With the FBI guys involved, they're the best, the guys on the tour are awesome, and they'll get to the bottom of it.' Allenby was most concerned about potentially not being able to call 13-year-old daughter Lily for her birthday, but scans have cleared him of any serious facial or head injuries and he is hopeful of being cleared to fly in the next day or two. 'She's really upset about it but at the end of the day it could have been a lot worse,' the Victorian said. 'I don't care about the money or my cards or anything like that. I am just glad I have survived this one.' According to The Golf Channel reporter Steve Sands who originally broke the story, Allenby was put into a car, woke up in a park 'groggy' and with no recollection of the events, before he was found by a retired military individual. The Australian golfer was then returned to the Kahala Hotel where he had spent the week while playing at the Sony Open held at the nearby Waialae Country Club - where Allenby failed to make the cut after the first two days of play. His friend Anthony Puntoriero - who was with Allenby earlier on the night - confirmed he was kidnapped. 'He's all right now but we are still talking to detectives,' Puntoriero told AAP. The 43-year-old had been drinking with caddy Mick Middlemo and friend Anthony Punteriero . Allenby was set to head back to the US on Saturday morning, but has stayed on to assist police . Maddlemo had been with Allenby earlier in the night . Puntoriero and Allenby's caddy were not with the four-time PGA Tour winner at the moment of the abduction. Allenby was set to head back to the US on Saturday morning, but has stayed on to assist police with their investigations. He reportedly managed to piece together some of the night after being reunited with Puntoriero and his caddy, and CCTV footage from the wine bar is being reviewed in an attempt to identify the perpetrators. The 43-year-old has been a professional golfer since 1992, and while a consistent performer on the PGA Tour for 15 years he has never won a major tournament. Allenby's best result at a major was to finish equal seventh - which he achieved twice - at the 2004 U.S. Open and the 2008 Open Championship. He won Australia's 'triple crown' in 2005 - winning the Masters, Australian PGA and Australian Open. He's also been a regular in the Presidents Cup, representing the International team five times between 1993 and 2009. The Melbourne-born golfer now lives in the U.S. full time, in Jupiter, Florida. Allenby's caddie, Mick Middlemo, said he was groggy after being woken up and had no recollection of what had happened. A passer-by found him and returned him to his hotel. The Golf Channel reports he returned to the wine bar to review the surveillance footage. No arrest has been made at this point.","Robert Allenby was drinking in a wine bar in Hawaii on Friday .

"West Ham outcast Ravel Morrison’s proposed move to Lazio hit a stumbling block on Tuesday, but he still expects to seal his move to Italy. The 21-year-old was due to travel to Rome to sign a pre-contract with the Serie A club on Wednesday. But the Hammers initially blocked Morrison’s trip to the Italian capital, insisting he did not have permission to fly over and would be in breach of contract if he did. Ravel Morrison's only Premier League appearance for West Ham this season was in August . The midfielder takes a shot against Brighton and Hove Albion during a loan spell at QPR last season . Teams played for: West Ham, Cardiff (loan), QPR (loan), Birmingham (loan), Manchester United . Appearances: 81 . Goals: 14 . Honours: FA Youth Cup (2011) Morrison, however, expects the issue to be resolved and remains confident of joining Lazio on a free transfer ahead of next season. The Hammers know they cannot stop Morrison, who has been dumped in the Under 21 squad by manager Sam Allardyce, from signing a Bosman deal this month with his contract expiring in the summer — but are playing hardball with the youngster. With personal terms agreed, Morrison was due to have a medical on Wednesday ahead of signing a three-year contract. Newcastle are closing in on Spain Under 19s Jorge Mere and David Concha. Concha has already visited the club’s stadium and training facilities and was a guest during the 1-0 home defeat by Sunderland last month. The winger, 18, who turned down an offer from Brentford, will be loaned back to Racing Santander to help them battle relegation from Spain’s second tier.

"Sheffield United boss Nigel Clough has warned that Tottenham Hotspur face the threat of another cup upset on Wednesday, claiming that Barclays Premier League teams don’t take the knock-out competitions as seriously as those in the lower divisions. Chelsea and Manchester City crashed out of the FA Cup on a weekend of shocks that also saw Spurs lose at home to Leicester.

Sheffield United boss Nigel Clough (left) has warned Tottenham they face the threat of another cup upset . Clough wants to cause an upset against Mauricio Pochettino (right) in the Capital One Cup semi-final . The 48-year-old believes that City’s decision to take a long-haul flight back from Abu Dhabi the day before their shock defeat against Middlesbrough is typical of how top-flight teams and their players view the domestic cup competitions. ‘I think it’s all down to the Premier League lads not taking the cups as seriously as the other players,’ said Clough. ‘The cups are so important to lower-league players, and I don’t think that’s matched in the Premier League. ‘I don’t think they regard it with the same importance, even when they put a full side out. ‘Whatever Man City want to do is their business, but to have a seven-and-a-half-hour flight the day before a game? I wonder if they’d do that for a Champions League game. ‘Would they fly back on Friday from Abu Dhabi before they play Chelsea this Saturday? ‘We can take inspiration from the weekend, certainly. It puts everyone on high alert. Anyone now who is facing a lower-league team, don’t take them lightly because, on their day, they can do things like Saturday. ‘Manchester United started it off (drawing at Cambridge) on Friday night. Things like that give you belief and inspiration. You watch a game and you go to bed thinking “come on, we can do this tomorrow”. It’s amazing how it works in players’ minds.’ Jay McEveley handled the ball inside his own penalty area in the 74th minute to give Tottenham a penalty . Andros Townsend stepped up and  converted to put Tottenham ahead with just over 15 minutes to play . Townsend jumps for joy after scoring the penalty to give Tottenham a first-leg lead over Sheffield United . Clough’s side trail Spurs 1-0 from the first-leg but he has yet to lose a cup tie at home during his 15 months in charge of the Blades. The South Yorkshire club progressed to the FA Cup semi-finals at Wembley last season and have already beaten three Premier League teams – West Ham, Southampton and QPR – in the knockout tournaments in this campaign. Clough is determined to make life as uncomfortable as possible for his opponents at a packed Bramall Lane. ‘We’re at home and 25,000 of the 30,000 will be cheering us on, that will make a difference,’ he added. ‘It’s a different kind of atmosphere and a different kind of football than they’ re used to. Even in the big Premier League games, it can be a little bit of a damp squib. ‘The pitch quality isn’t as good as they’re used to playing on week in, week out. We’ve got to make it everything they’re not comfortable with. ‘I’m sure Spurs will be aware of the sort of game it could be for them. There’s a few lads who’ve been out on loan and they’ll know what it’s about – Danny Rose, (Andros) Townsend, (Aaron) Lennon, (Ryan) Mason’s a good young English midfielder, Kyle Walker. They’ve got a few with that sort of experience and they’re probably going to need it.’ However, Clough is refusing to look beyond tonight’s tie to the possibility of a Wembley return on March 1. ‘I’ve honestly not even thought about getting that far,’ admitted. ‘I was speaking to the chairman at Burton Albion about getting together for lunch on a Sunday and he said “give us a couple of dates”. ‘I gave him a couple and he said “that one’s okay, but the other one, I’m hoping to be cheering you on at Wembley!”.’ Tottenham striker Emmanuel Adebayor tries to evade the challenge from Sheffield United's Michael Doyle .

Diedhiou of Senegal opened the scoring in Atletico's first attack, as the hosts nipped the ball off Arsenal from kick off. The visitors struggled to find their rhythm for 45 minutes, but had a flurry of chances in the second half. Stephy Mavididi went close after the restart, while Kaylen Hinds should have done better with 10 minutes remaining.

'As time goes by you realise how difficult it is. There are times when it gets close and goes away again. In this competition, you need a bit of luck.

"Temperatures at Stamford Bridge may have been touching zero, but there was a distinctly Brazilian feel about the Chelsea-Liverpool Capital One Cup semi-final. When Jose Mourinho brought on Ramires for the injured Cesc Fabregas in the 50th minute, there were no less than seven Brazilian-born players on the field.

Costa, who was granted Spanish citizenship in September 2013 and now represents the Spain national team, was certainly in the thick of the action. The striker felt he deserved a penalty when fouled by Martin Skrtel, but he could face retrospective punishment for a stamp on Emre Can before later clashing with Skrtel and Steven Gerrard. Brendan Rodgers, meanwhile, named Lucas Leiva and Philippe Coutinho in his XI, further strengthening the Brazilian connection.

"The BBC’s voice of golf Peter Alliss has spoken of his ‘great sadness’ at the prospect of the corporation losing live coverage of The Open Championship to Sky. ‘I’m just glad I am 83 not 35 and reliant on working for the BBC’s sports department, because I think I would be looking for another trade,’ he said. Alliss believes the writing has been on the wall for years, but is disappointed his employers haven’t done more to keep the R&A happy. ‘In one sense it seems to me it’s like playing poker against Donald Trump or Warren Buffett in that the BBC can’t compete against Sky’s bottomless pockets of money,’ he said. ‘And you can’t deny Sky do a fantastic job. 'You might be annoyed at the adverts but they go to faraway places and cover these events even though there might be only eight people watching on Thursday. Their commitment to show everything is extraordinary. Legendary golf commentator Peter Alliss will be sad to see The Open leave terrestrial screens . Rory McIlroy kisses the Claret Jug after his two-stroke victory at the 2014 Open Championship . McIlory's triumph was available for all to see on BBC, but that all may change with the rumoured new TV deal . ‘But, hand on heart, I can’t not criticise the BBC. They are far and away the R&A’s biggest television client, so why haven’t they said to them: “You know, we’re struggling against the financial might of Sky but why don’t we also cover some of the other events you run, like the Amateur Championship and the Boys Championship and the Walker Cup?” We used to do those events years ago, so why not again? I think it would have shown the R&A that they cared. I definitely think going back there were people who fought harder to keep tournaments on the BBC. At one point we covered 18 events. ‘Now you look at the move up to Manchester and how many millions that cost, and you wonder about the value in that. This week we’ve got two or three hours of indoor bowls on each day which of course is of great interest to the people who play it but no interest at all to anyone else. I guess for some people it’s progress but for people like you and I, it seems a move in the opposite direction.’ The ‘crown jewels’ are a list of prestigious sporting events of national importance which may interest non-sports fans. The events are protected under the 1996 Broadcasting Act, which ensures they are shown on free-to-air television — such as the BBC. Delayed highlights of the B-list events also have to be shown on terrestrial television.

B-list: . - England Test matches — exclusive UK live coverage on Sky Sports since 2006 . - Wimbledon non-finals play — live coverage on BBC . - All other matches in Rugby World Cup finals — all 2015 matches will be shown live on ITV or ITV4 . - The Open — live on BBC until 2016 . - The Ryder Cup — exclusive UK live coverage on Sky Sports since 1995 . - Cricket World Cup — shown on Sky Sports since 1992, every match live since 2003 . - Commonwealth Games — live on BBC . - World Athletics Championships — live coverage on BBC until at least 2017 . - Six Nations matches involving home countries — live coverage on BBC until at least 2017 . As you can probably gather, this is a subject on which the great man feels rightly passionate. How could it be any other way since he’s worked for the BBC since 1961? ‘It’s been a large part of my life and I have enjoyed every minute of it and it seems to be really sad that it’s all coming to an end largely because of money,’ he said. ‘But this is the way of the world, I suppose. I never thought the Masters would be taken away from the BBC, for example, or rather the rights split with Sky. Augusta don’t have a money tree, rather a money orchard, but you get one or two new people on a committee who see this carrot dangled in front of them, and I guess that’s the same with the R&A. ‘But I’m not sure the R&A balance the books in the best way. They’re very generous to golf clubs who have parts of their course eroded by the sea and do great deeds around the world. But think about the audiences the BBC get for the Masters over Sky. It’s always five times as much. Shouldn’t the R&A take those figures into account, when participation levels in the game are falling?’ Negotiations between the R&A. the BBC and Sky over live rights for The Open from next year are expected to be concluded over the next fortnight. It is widely expected that coverage thereafter on the BBC will be restricted to highlights packages each evening. Former Open Champion Tony Jacklin, who worked alongside Alliss at the BBC for many years, agrees it will be a ‘sad day’ if The Open is no longer aired live on free-to-air television. But, given the BBC’s apparent state of apathy, he can fully understand why the R&A are likely to jump ship. At 13 years of age, Sir Nick Faldo was inspired to play golf while watching the 1971 Masters on television . Darren Clarke is favourite to be appointed Europe’s Ryder Cup captain in mid-February . ‘It was wonderful to work for the BBC when they were fully committed to golf but they appear ready to withdraw altogether now, and so who can blame the R&A if they give the rights to Sky?’ he said. ‘The world turns, and Sky have done such a wonderful job for the European Tour and are so professional in their coverage.’ As for Alliss, he has no plans for retirement. ‘Although I’m creaking and groaning a bit these days I’m still lively from the chin upwards and still have opinions,’ he said. ‘I still enjoy it, and I’ll be at the Masters, The Open and women’s Open. I just feel so sorry for all those who have enjoyed live golf on the BBC over many years and all those millions who can’t afford Sky. Let’s hope a deal can be done that looks after these people.’ Former Open champion Tony Jacklin (right, with Alliss) also believes it will be a 'sad day' if The Open moves .","Peter Alliss speaks of 'sadness' at the prospect of Sky taking The Open .

The 21-year-old midfielder was introduced to the media at the Bernabeu on Monday afternoon after successfully undergoing a medical at Sanitas La Moraleja Hospital. The news comes just three days after the Spanish giants snapped up 16-year-old Norwegian wonderkid Martin Odegaard.

The 21-year-old gives the thumbs up after he was presented to the media at  the Bernabeu . Silva, who has penned a deal until June 2020, had been heavily linked with Arsenal but the Brazilian opted against a move to the Premier League to sign for Carlo Ancelotti's side. The highly-rated youngster is regarded as one of Brazil's most talented players, with Real president Florentino Perez hailing him as one of his country's best defensive midfielders. Alongside Perez at his unveiling, Silva told the media: 'I've come here to learn and to help out. Silva poses outside Real Madrid's trophy cabinet with a Real shirt which has his name and number on .

The Brazilian wonderkid poses in front of a backdrop of the iconic Bernabeu stadium . 'It's a dream come true and I'm very happy. I feel very ready to wear and honour this shirt. 'This is the best club in the world and I'm going to be very happy.' Silva, who will wear the No 16 shirt, could make his debut against David Moyes' Real Sociedad on Saturday, with Ancelotti forced to shuffle the pack following Cristiano Ronaldo's dismissal in the 2-1 win against Cordoba on Saturday. Madrid will be pleased to have got a deal for the midfielder over the line after it was revealed earlier in the day  that FIFA have opened an investigation into the signing of two under-age players in 2012 and 2013.

Both Manuel Godoy and Fernando Macias were on a tour of trials with a host of clubs interested, but Madrid snapped them up before they could reach River Plate and Milan. Madrid now have a month to file all relevant paperwork to FIFA and demonstrate they have not contravened the governing body's Article 14, which only allows the signing of under 18s from outside the EU if the player's parents have had to move to the country where the club is based, for non-football reasons. If found guilty, Madrid could be handed a transfer embargo similar to the one currently imposed on arch-rivals Barcelona.","Lucas Silva was unveiled as a Real Madrid player on a deal until 2020 .

"Real Madrid are the most clinically efficient scorers across the 'Big Five' divisions of Europe so far this season, according to new figures showing they have managed one goal for every 5.4 attempts in La Liga. No other top-flight side among the 98 clubs from the Premier League, La Liga, Germany's Bundesliga, Italy's Serie A or France's Ligue 1 takes as few attempts to score each goal. Real Madrid are inspired by the stunning efficiency of Cristiano Ronaldo, who has already scored an astonishing 28 league goals in 18 games this season. His team-mate Gareth Bale has added another 10 league goals in 16 starts. Ballon d'Or winner Cristiano Ronaldo has been in superb form for Real Madrid this season, scoring 28 goals . Ronaldo leaps highest to score against El Classico rivals Barcelona in the La Liga match in October . Welsh forward Gareth Bale joined Real Madrid for a world record fee of £85 million from Tottenham in 2013 . Bale curls in a stunning free-kick against Espanyol to help his side to a 3-0 win earlier this month . Striker Karim Benzema is averaging a goal every two games in all competitions for Real Madrid this season . The numbers have been published by the Football Observatory in Switzerland. The four most clinical teams are all Spanish, with Valencia in second place (5.7 attempts per goal), followed by Atletico Madrid (6) and Barcelona (6.6). The most clinical English team are Chelsea, with one goal per seven attempts. They are in joint 10th place of the 98 clubs. Also above them are Lyon of France and Sevilla of Spain (both 6.7 attempts per goal), and a trio of German clubs: Eintracht Frankfurt, Hertha Berlin and Schalke (all 6.9 attempts per goal). Diego Costa has been the driving force in helping Chelsea's surge to the top of the efficiency rankings as well as the top of the table with 17 goals in 19 Premier League appearances. Eden Hazard with eight goals in 22 league games is their next highest scorer. As Chelsea prepare to face Liverpool tonight in the second leg of their Capital One Cup semi-final, it is notable that Liverpool are down in 66th place of the 98 clubs, taking 11.1 attempts per goal this season. Chelsea striker Diego Costa leads the Premier League goal-scoring charts with 17 goals from 19 games . Despite only scoring five league goals in 20 games, Steven Gerrard is Liverpool's top scorer this season . Club, country, (average shots per goal) 1. Real Madrid, Spain, (5.4) 2.

Schalke, Germany, (6.7) 10=. Chelsea, England, (7.0) 10=. Paris Saint German, France, (7.0) Steven Gerrard is their leading league scorer with five goals in 20 appearances and nine in all competitions. Raheem Sterling is next with four league goals and three League Cup goals to make seven in total but no other Liverpool player has scored more than four goals in all competitions combined. Chelsea, whose league efficiency at converting attempts is more than twice as good as Liverpool's, have six players with five or more goals each this season in all competitions, with Oscar, Didier Drogba, Andre Schurrle and defender John Terry in addition to Costa and Hazard. The next most efficient English teams in the league after Chelsea are Southampton and Manchester United, in joint 15th place in Europe on 7.6 attempts per goal. West Ham and Manchester City are joint 29th, on 8.5 attempts per goal then Arsenal in joint 39th place on nine attempts per goal. Chelsea have shared the goals this season and defender John Terry has managed seven from 27 games . Tottenham (9.3), Everton (9.5) and Crystal Palace (9.8) are the only other English clubs in the top 50. At the other end of the chart, only one club of the 98 included are worse at converting attempts than Aston Villa, who are in 97th place with on 20.9 shots per goal. That is Hamburg of the Bundesliga, on 22.9. Aston Villa are particularly woeful at taking chances in the second half of games. As the researchers from the Observatory said: 'These figures both reflect a lack of efficiency and the difficulty in taking up a favourable position to shoot. For example, Villa have scored only two goals out of 109 attempts in second halves.' After Chelsea, Manchester United (pictured) and Southampton are the most efficient English goal-scorers . Aston Villa are ranked 97th of 98 teams in the table and average a goal after every 20.9 attempts .","Real Madrid are the most lethal goal-scorers of Europe's top five leagues .

"Arsenal forward Theo Walcott has revealed that Tomas Rosicky's no look pass before his stunning volley from the return ball against Brighton in the FA Cup was no new trick, as the Czech midfielder regularly produces similar pieces of skill in training. He told the Daily Star, 'Of course, that's what Tomas does in training all the time, looking the other way when he's passing the ball. 'It gets me every time! He's got that quality going forward. I love the way Tomas just turns and breaks with it. The goal was fantastic.' 'It gets me every time!' Arsenal forward Walcott reveals Rosicky's no look passes are no new trick . Rosicky performs a no look pass before smashing the return ball into the net against Brighton on Sunday . For some, like Match of the Day pundit Mark Lawrenson, Rosicky's goal was the embodiment of spatial awareness and of the free-flowing football style that manager Arsene Wenger likes to ingrain into his sides. For others, though, his moment of creativity has been dismissed as needless showboating. Former Manchester United defender Phil Neville said he would have 'smashed' anyone who tried a no look pass on him. Rosicky's goal helped Arseal to a 3-2 win over Brighton and earned them a spot in the FA Cup fifth-round where they will face Middlesbrough.

"Jose Mourinho insists there is more to come from Didier Drogba at Chelsea as the striker says he wants to stay at the club beyond the end of the season. Mourinho led the tributes to Drogba as he was honoured for his outstanding contribution to the game by the Football Writers' Association at a Gala Tribute evening at the Savoy Hotel in London on Sunday. Mourinho hailed Drogba, who first joined Chelsea for £24million in 2004, as the club's 'best value player ever' and insisted the 36-year-old was 'not finished yet.' Chelsea striker Didier Drogba poses with his award at the Football Writers' Association Gala Tribute evening . Drogba, in action against Bradford on Saturday, has been signed by Jose Mourinho on two occasions . The 36-year-old celebrates scoring against Manchester United at Old Trafford in October last year . Dressed smartly in a blue suit and bow tie, Drogba  followed the likes of Mourinho, Sir Alex Ferguson and David Beckham by picking up the prestigious award. He said: When you have achieved so much and won so many trophies like we have done in the past 10 years, that creates something special. 'I hope, and the club makes me believe, I am part of this big family, so we are going to find the best thing for both of us to promote the club in the best way."" 'When I left this club (the first time in 2012), I was saying that I had done everything I wanted to do, but I think now that I did not do everything, I think there is more to do. 'I love this club and would love to be part of this club for the future, with the new players.' Earlier Mourinho, speaking to the Football Writers' Association, said: 'I came to Chelsea in the summer of 2004 and in my first written report to Mr Abramovich in relation to my plans for the club, I gave the names of some players. 'Big names were arriving at Chelsea in that period. The previous summer, for example, Claude Makelele came from Real Madrid and Hernan Crespo came from Inter, among others, but Didier was unknown and the price was very, very high. 'Yet I knew as clearly as I have ever done that he was the player I wanted. 'I was very strong to persuade my club to pay such an amount for him and I think we can already say he was the best-value signing for Chelsea in relation to what he has done for the club over so many years, and he is not finished yet.' Jose Mourinho, pictured with Drogba shortly after signing him in 2004, says the striker is his favourite player . Drogba poses for photographers after winning the Champions League with Chelsea in May 2012 . Drogba celebrates winning the 2012 FA Cup with team-mates John Terry (centre) and Frank Lampard . Drogba has been recognised for his impressive performances on the pitch over the last 16 years and also his charity work away from it, with his foundation having funded many projects in his homeland of the Ivory Coast. The 36-year-old, who started in Chelsea's shock 4-2 defeat by Bradford on Saturday, expressed his gratitude at being picked as this year's recipient. He said: 'I am really proud for this award, in the list of previous winners there are a lot of players whom I really respect and grew up trying to reach there level, so for me this is a great honour. 'When I came to England, things were difficult, there was the language barrier and culture change. 'With time, we managed to learn more from each other and today I am really happy that the football writers not only understand me a lot on the pitch, but have also helped me with my foundation work.' Midfielder Joe Cole (right) holds the Premier League trophy with Drogba at Stamford Bridge in May 2005 . Drogba holds the League Cup in 2007 after beating Arsenal at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff . Mourinho also revealed that he counts Drogba as his favourite player, describing him as a 'phenomenal' person. Mourinho added: 'Throughout my career, I have always refused to say which is my favourite player or the best person, because so many have given soul and blood to play and to fight with me, but if I have to choose one who represents all the good things you want in a player and a man, I think in this moment I would choose Didier.' 'Didier arrived at Stamford Bridge for £24million, but he is probably the best-value Chelsea player ever, and I remember clearly how it happened. 'I came to Chelsea in the summer of 2004 and in my first written report to Mr Abramovich in relation to my plans for the club, I gave the names of some players. 'Big names were arriving at Chelsea in that period. The previous summer, for example, Claude Makelele came from Real Madrid and Hernan Crespo came from Inter, among others, but Didier was unknown and the price was very, very high. 'Yet I knew as clearly as I have ever done that he was the player I wanted. 'I was very strong to persuade my club to pay such an amount for him and I think we can already say he was the best-value signing for Chelsea in relation to what he has done for the club over so many years, and he is not finished yet. 'My story with him started after I got Marseille in my Champions League group when I was manager of Porto. 'Before we played against them, I travelled to Marseille to watch them play Paris Saint Germain and I was amazed with the potential I saw in him. 'When we played against them, I met him in the tunnel before the game and I told him, 'I don't have money to buy you, do you have a cousin like you who is lost in Ivory Coast?' 'That was the first time that the big guy put his arm around me. He told me, 'In Porto, you don't have money to buy me, but if you move to another club where you do have money to buy me, then I will go with you.' 'After the Champions League final with Porto at the end of that season, I moved to Chelsea and immediately began the process to sign him. 'Reflecting on our relationship, I have three moments in my mind that best characterise the man – because Didier the man is just as great as Didier the player. 'The first one was when I met him at Farnborough Airport when he was landing to sign for Chelsea. The way he hugged me, and the way he thanked me was not normal for a player towards a manager, immediately after signing for a new club. Chelsea were changing his life forever in that moment, and he knew that. 'The second moment was after we won the 2007 FA Cup at Wembley against Manchester United. The game finished and I went to the dressing room, leaving the players to enjoy the moment and to celebrate on the pitch. 'I was on the phone with my wife, when suddenly a big monster ran into the dressing room and told me that if I didn't come with the players, they wouldn't collect the cup. They would only go up there with me. 'I told him that I wanted the players to go and enjoy the moment together – that I didn't need to be there – and he said, ""We are only one. You can come by your will, or I will carry you there!"" 'The third moment was when I left Chelsea in 2007 and I saw the big man crying like a baby. 'So I can say that he is a phenomenal person, and I have also had the privilege to visit his country and to see what he means, not just to the people of Ivory Coast, but to so many African nations in that region. 'I know what he means as a player and as a person. That is why this combination of the player and the person is so amazing. 'Throughout my career, I have always refused to say which is my favourite player or the best person, because so many have given soul and blood to play and to fight with me, but if I have to choose one who represents all the good things you want in a player and a man, I think in this moment I would choose Didier.'","Didier Drogba attended the FWA's Gala Tribute evening on Sunday .

"Robin van Persie is backing his Manchester United side to bounce back against Cambridge United in their FA Cup fourth round replay at Old Trafford next week. Louis van Gaal’s side were held to a goalless draw by the League Two minnows at the Abbey Stadium last Friday. United have not tasted FA Cup glory since 2004, and Van Persie feels the time is right for the club to seize their opportunity. Robin van Persie came off the bench against Cambridge but he was unable to break the deadlock . ‘I think it's vital,' Van Persie said. 'Especially with this Cup, because it's been 11 years ago since Manchester United won it last? ‘We want to win it. This club has wanted to win it for years now, but now we have a big chance.’ Van Gaal’s men were subjected to heavy criticism after their poor display against Cambridge, but after the extraordinary FA Cup results the following day in which Manchester City and Chelsea were both dumped out by lower league opposition, Van Persie admitted that the mood had changed at Old Trafford. Radamel Falcao and Co were unable to find a way through against the League Two side at the Abbey Stadium . Cambridge players express their joy after securing a lucrative replay at Old Trafford after their 0-0 draw .

'After the game against Cambridge, everyone was a bit down,’ Van Persie explained. ‘But you have to give them credit. It's quite a stunt to do what they did which is very nice for them. But in a way, especially after tea time on Saturday, the whole mood changed. City went out, Chelsea went out and suddenly we are in it with a home tie against Cambridge. 'Out of all the big teams, it's just us, Arsenal, Liverpool and West Ham left. But from all these teams, we are highest in the league so does that make us favourites? I don't know. I'm still very happy to be in it.’","Manchester United were held to a goalless draw by Cambridge United .

"Top seed Serena Williams overcame another slow start - and a coughing fit - to beat Garbine Muguruza in three sets and gain a measure of revenge for her defeat at the hands of the 24th seed in the second round of the French Open. Muguruza won 6-2, 6-2 at Roland Garros last year and threatened to do the same on Rod Laver Arena as she won four games in a row from 2-2 in the opening set. Williams, who had to save three set points against Vera Zvonareva in round two and then came from a set down to defeat Elina Svitolina, won the second set 6-3 to level the match and then crucially held serve at the start of the decider. Serena Williams roars in celebration as she beats Garbine Muguruza . Williams was a set down and on the verge of going out before she fought back to progress . Muguruza got off to a good start but was unable to see the match out . The world No 1 had to save six break points in an epic game lasting 13 minutes and then immediately broke a disheartened opponent on her way to taking the set by a flattering 6-2 scoreline. Williams then thanked a spectator for some valuable advice in an on-court interview, adding: 'She (Muguruza) played so well and she did everything she needed to do in the first set. Muguruza put up a good fight but was unable to book her place in the quarter-finals . Williams was backed by the crowd on the Rod Laver Arena and thanked them at the end for their support . 'I just decided to do my best and stay focused and stay relaxed. She hits the ball really, really big and hard, but someone in the crowd was like 'Use spin'. I was like 'Okay' and it really helped me.' Williams struggled with a cough during the match and the interview, the 33-year-old admitting she had been 'a little sick the past couple of days'.","Serena Williams beat Garbine Muguruza 2-6, 6-3, 6-2 .

"THIS, Manchester City really should concede, is why you avoid long-haul travel on the eve of a game. Why matters here in England need to remain the priority ahead of commitments to their super-rich owners in Abu Dhabi. Why a catwalk encounter with Hamburg was probably not what Manuel Pellegrini and his players needed after that bruising defeat by Arsenal the previous weekend. Pellegrini would not admit it, of course. Blaming his employers for this, City’s second FA Cup defeat by Championship opposition in as many years, would amount to printing off his own P45. Particularly when the airline are the club sponsors. But City performed like a team that had sat on a plane for seven hours, arriving late on Friday night after five days in a different time zone. And Middlesbrough were only too happy to take advantage. Middlesbrough striker Patrick Bamford celebrates after scoring for his side against Manchester City . Bamford was put through on goal after Manchester City goalkeeper Willy Caballero collided with Albert Adomah . The Middlesbrough forward raced through before beating Manchester City midfielder Fernando to the ball to convert .

Subs not used: Ripley, Husband, Omeruo, Woodgate . Booked: Ayala, Whitehead . Goals:  Bamford 52' Kike 90' Referee: Phil Dowd . Attendance: 44,836 . Had Aitor Karanka’s side looked tired, they too would have had an excuse. This was their third match in a week after all. But players pushing hard for promotion seemed eager to demonstrate that they will be ready should they find themselves back in the Premier League next season. With second-half goals from Patrick Bamford and Kike, a place in the fifth round of this competition was no less than they deserved. City might well point to the period of dominance they enjoyed in the opening 45 minutes and a series of outstanding saves from Tomas Mejias did deny them a goal. But it was a very different City side that stumbled through the second half, with fatigue as serious an issue as a lack of composure, after Bamford superseded his previous appearance at The Etihad — as a paying spectator at a Bon Jovi concert. In the case of that opening goal, there might also have been a hint of cowardice, with the error-prone Willy Caballero seemingly reluctant to commit to a 50:50 challenge with Albert Adomah. For a watching Pellegrini, it certainly amounted to the stuff of nightmares. First came the undercooked backpass from Fernando, then the sight of Caballero allowing Adomah to knock the ball beyond him, before the two of them ended up in a heap and then, finally, the sight of a sluggish Fernando trying to make a clearance that Bamford was bright enough to anticipate, intercept and direct the ball over the line. As Pellegrini admitted, ‘disorder’ spread through City’s ranks and Boro were only too happy to exploit their weaknesses. Defensively Boro were outstanding here but there were some fine attacking displays too. Bamford, on loan from Chelsea, was among the best but Lee Tomlin was terrific, almost scoring too when he followed a marvellous turn with a shot that bounced off a post and across the face of goal.

Manager Manuel Pellegrini and his players arrived back in Manchester at about 8pm on Friday night . David Silva and Vincent Kompany headed straight to the club's training base to prepare for Saturday's game . For City’s stunned supporters, the only consolation was the fact that they were charged so little to witness this. Just £15 for adults and a fiver for kids. But if Pellegrini insisted his side were taking this competition as seriously as the others after being eliminated here by Wigan last term — he said as much in his programme notes — the evidence suggested otherwise. The warning signs were there in the opening minute when Vincent Kompany made a mistake that Boro went close to capitalising on. But in fairness to City, they did then show enough composure to play some decent football that, had it not been for Mejias, would have been rewarded with a goal. The shots on target were frequent but so too were some excellent saves from the Spaniard. He might have played for Real Madrid only once in seven years, but he excelled in the way he denied James Milner, David Silva and Stevan Jovetic. Other opportunities were squandered by City. Sergio Aguero invited Silva to score but the shot was way off target, while Dedryck Boyata took two swipes at a Milner cross only to send his second effort yards over the crossbar. In total, City had 13 shots in the first half; a measure, if you like, of their frustration. Manchester City striker Sergio Aguero runs with the ball between a trio of Middlesbrough players .

Bamford’s goal made that miss all the more frustrating for City, but all the more concerning for their manager was the fact that soon afterwards they almost gave away a second. Again Caballero was at fault, passing straight to Tomlin who then skipped past one challenge before unleashing a shot that the Argentine goalkeeper – to his credit – saved before three City bodies threw themselves in the path of the follow-up effort from Grant Leadbitter. Pellegrini responded by sending on Frank Lampard from the bench, and the former Chelsea midfielder almost equalised when a deflected effort bounced off a post. But Boro had other chances before Kike’s breakaway strike, with Tomlin seeing a shot bounce off a post and Adomah almost lob Caballero.

For Karanka, a one-time Real Madrid player meeting a former Madrid manager for the first time, it must have been particularly pleasurable. For Pellegrini, however, there was plenty to regret. Long-haul travel being one of them. With the start of the second half came yet another marvellous stop by Mejias, this time to parry a goal-bound header from Jovetic. Bamford’s goal made that miss all the more costly for City, but all the more concerning for their manager was the fact that, soon afterwards, they almost gave away a second.

South Korea had looked the most likely to score in a cagey opening to the match with Son Heung-Min, the two-goal hero of South Korea's quarter-final victory over Uzbekistan, drawing a fingertip save out of Jalal Hassan with a long-range effort. Just a minute later, the Koreans were in front, Kim Jin-Su curling a free-kick into the box and Lee rising above the Iraqi defence to head down and into the net. Iraq skipper Younis Mahmoud was making his presence felt up front but the Koreans are a side not easily bullied at the back and he was more often than not battling alone in the first half. Even the persistent rain that fell on Sydney all day was not able to dampen the spirits of a noisy crowd of just over 36,000, the South Koreans at one end with inflatable batons and the band of Iraqis at the other accompanied by drums and whistles. The Koreans had more to shout about but Iraq gave their supporters a lift - following a flurry of attacks just before the break - when winger Amjed Kalaf's raking drive forced Kim Jin-Hyeon to get down low to push the ball across his goal. The South Korean goalkeeper almost gifted the Iraqis an equaliser when he rashly charged out of his area three minutes after the break, but just two minutes later, his side doubled their lead. South Korea can boast the meanest defence in the competition, having yet to concede a goal .

The ball bounced around the area in an extended bout of aerial ping-pong from a Son corner, before Lee Jeong-Hyeop chested the ball down for Kim Young-Gwon to hit it first time from the edge of the box past the despairing dive of Hassan. Iraq were forced to press forward but clear-cut opportunities were still few and far between for them, while Hassan had to be at his sharpest to deny long-range efforts from South Korean skipper Ki Sung-Yueng and Son inside a minute. Kalaf continued to cause problems with his pace but there always seemed to be a South Korean foot or head to cut out the final ball and prevent a scoring chance.

"United Arab Emirates produced one of the greatest Asian Cup upsets to send champions Japan tumbling out of the tournament 5-4 on penalties after their quarter-final finished 1-1 after extra time on Friday. After Japan's Shinji Kagawa had missed the first sudden-death spot kick, defender Ismail Ahmed nervelessly converted the decisive penalty to send his team into a last four meeting with hosts Australia on Tuesday. The winner of that semi-final in Newcastle will meet Iraq or South Korea to decide the continental champions back at Stadium Australia on January 31.

Substitute Gaku Shibasaki had earlier saved the blushes of the Samurai Blue by equalising nine minutes from the end of normal time after Ali Ahmed Mabkhout had given the Gulf nation an early lead with his fourth goal of the tournament. Mabkhout's powerful shot into the corner of the net after seven minutes was the first goal Japan had conceded in Australia, stunning the blue-shirted, drum-thumping band of their supporters behind the goal into a rare silence. Japan have not won the Asian Cup four times in the last six tournaments by panicking, though, and they continued to press forward after the goal with the neat inter-passing game that won them three from three in the group stage. As they had in those games, however, Japan failed to convert possession into clear-cut chances, Takashi Inui wasting the best of them in the first half by directing his far post header straight at goalkeeper Majed Naser. Japan had kept danger man Omar Abdulrahman quiet before half-time but the languid midfielder nearly helped his side double the lead four minutes after the break with a delightful flick into the box that Mabkhout just failed to control. Former Manchester United attacking midfielder Shinji Kagawa looks despondent after missing a penalty . Inui had been replaced by Yoshinori Muto during the interval and the substitute had two chances to make a quick impression but flashed a shot wide before also failing to hit the target with a free header. That set the template for the next half an hour of the match. The UAE goal was under almost permanent siege but a combination of stout defending and misfiring Japan forwards kept the underdogs ahead until Shibasaki lashed the ball into the net from the edge of the area after a one-two with Keisuke Honda. Having been handed a lifeline, Japan looked determined to finish the tie in normal time but continued to waste a string of chances and the profligacy continued into a strangely passionless extra half an hour. Honda sent the opening spot kick high over the bar but Khamis Esmaeel the same with the the UAE's third penalty and the shootout went to sudden death.","United Arab Emirates produced a major upset by defeating Japan .

"South Africa’s hopes of qualifying for the quarter finals at the Africa Cup of Nations hang by a thread after they drew with Senegal in Mongomo. Oupa Manyisa rounded off a fine move with a clinical finish early in the second half to give Shakes Mashaba’s side the lead, but Serigne Mbodji, bizarrely wearing gloves despite the stifling jungle heat, leveled things up 15 minutes later with a towering header. The result puts Senegal top of the competitions’s ‘Group of Death’, a point ahead of both Ghana and Algeria, but Bafana Bafana must win their final game against the Black Stars to have any chance of progression. South Africa's Tokelo Rantie (right) celebrates Oupa Manyisa's opening goal against Senegal . Senegal's defender Kara Mbodji (right) celebrates after scoring the equaliser against South Africa . After a first half of few chances, the game came to life in the second, with Manyisa’s goal igniting a crowd that had already watched 135 minutes of football with barely a shot on target following the bore-fest earlier between the group's other two sides. A neat move saw Bournemouth striker Tokelo Rantie create space and feed Thuso Phala down the right. His low cross found Oupa Manyisa at the back post and the Orlando Pirates winger made no mistake, slotting coolly past Coundoul. As it had in their previous game against Ghana, going a goal behind brough Senegal out of their shells. They had shaded the possession from the off, but aside from an early run from Southampton’s Sadio Mane, returning from injury after missing the win over Ghana with a troublesome hamstring, the Senegalese carried little threat from open play, despite their array of forwards. However, when the majority of your team are over six foot and built like a fleet of tanks, set pieces will always be a threat. South Africa's goalkeeper Jackson Mabokgwane clears the ball during the Group C clash . South Africa's Dean Furman (left) challenges Senegal's Pape Kouli Diopi for possession . And so it proved. Having gone close several times - Stoke City’s Mame Biram Diouf the most culpable – and having had a Mane goal disallowed correctly for offside, finally the Senegalese superiority in the air told. Mbodji got up highest at the back post and powered a header over Thapelo Mabokgwane to equalize. The keeper was not directly at fault, but it was his uncertainty under the high ball that contributed to South Africa’s nervousness at set pieces. Mabokgawane always looked shaky, twice misjudging a cross and almost dropping it into his own net, and fumbling Diouf’s header in the lead-up to Mane’s disallowed goal. You have to sympathise with the Bafana Bafana boss Mashaba – after first choice keeper’s Senzo Meyiwa tragic death just weeks ago, he decided Darren Keet would get the number one jersey. But Keet was at fault for at least one, perhaps two of the three goals South Africa conceded against Algeria, and Mashaba has had to call upon Mabokgwane, who just a few months ago was considered fourth choice for the national side. The 27-year-old did make one excellent save, however, pushing away Dame Ndoye’s shot at full stretch as Senegal pushed for a winner.

Senegal's Cheikh Mbengue (left) challenges South Africa's Tokelo Rantie in the air . Senegal's defender Mbodji (centre) celebrates after levelling the tie on the hour mark . The result was harsh on South Africa, who played some lovely football before falling to defeat in their first game on Monday, and again showed plenty of one-touch interplay around the box, threatening to create chances. However, actually breaching a well-organised Senegalese backline proved difficult, and Bouna Coundoul was rarely overly stretched in goal. Sibusiso Vilikazi forced Coundoul into a sharp save with a rising drive after a lovely passage of play, and Thabo Matlaba fired just wide from a similar move on the other side, but chances were relatively few and far between. The niggly nature of the game suited Senegal, who carried far more physical presence, particularly in midfield. Doncaster Rovers midfielder, and South Africa captain, Dean Furman was incensed by one tackle in particular, when Lamine Gassama lunged in on Andile Jali, but escaped a booking. And, in the end, it was the extra height and presence that the Senegal side possessed, rather than any particular skill, that could have earned them all three points, Mbodji coming close to his second goal, again with a header from a set piece, in the closing stages.","South Africa's hopes of qualifying for quarter-finals hang by a thread .

"A stoppage time goal from captain Asamoah Gyan handed Avram Grant’s Ghana side a vital win, and leaves their qualification hopes for the quarter finals of the Africa Cup of Nations in their own hands. In a game lacking quality, Gyan’s last-gasp winner was the only notable shot on target, but it was enough to secure a crucial three points. The former Sunderland striker, who had been largely disappointing until he burst past the Algerian defence in the 92nd minute to finish past Rais Mbolhi, was back in the team after a bout of Malaria. Asamoah Gyan (left) shoots to score in the final seconds of Ghana's game against Algeria . Gyan celebrates, while team-mate - Crystal Palace youngster Kwesi Appiah - is seen behind .

Booked: Bougherra 45+1, Bentaleb 73 . Referee: Koman Coulibaly . But despite his captain's lack of threat throughout the game, Grant left him on the field, and was rewarded seconds from time. Up until that point Gyan hadn’t looked at all fit, and for a player who possesses as much pace and skill as he does, it was notable that he didn’t get in behind the Algerian defence for the first time until after more than an hour had been played. On that occasion, he fired a tame effort, which wouldn’t have given MBolhi any trouble even if had been on target, well wide. Gyan’s return also meant that Jordan Ayew, dangerous in bursts on Tuesday, was wasted playing behind his captain – when the Lorraine forward moved alongside Gyan in the second half the Black Stars were significantly more positive. Having lost to a late goal against Senegal, the Black Stars knew they could not afford another defeat against the pre-tournament favourites, and a draw would have meant hoping for other results to go their way.

Ghana defender Daniel Amartey (left) intervenes as Nabil Bentaleb (second left) argues with Agyemang Badu . Badu (centre) is pushed by Tottenham midfielder Bentaleb (left) and forward Ishak Belfodil (right) But both sides offered very little going forward, with neither keeper making a save of note for 90 minutes. After a dire first half, Ghana did try and play some more attacking football in the second period, but the closest they came to a goal before Gyan’s winner was when Jordan Ayew met his brother Andre’s cross with a clever flick that flew over the bar, while Gyan also saw a header flash across the face of goal. In the absence of striker Islam Slimani, left out of the starting line-up despite scoring against South Africa, Algeria switched to a 4-4-2, with Yacine Brahimi pushed on alongside Ishak Belfodil, and Tottenham’s Nabil Bentaleb moving to the left side of midfield. The Desert foxes dominated possession, but their passing lacked any sort of penetration, while Ghana were happy to sit back and play on the break. Ghana's Harrison Afful (left) challenges Algeria's midfielder Bentaleb during the match in Mongomo . Neither side could break the deadlock in Equatorial Guinea until the final moments of the match . The only opening before the break came after 20 minutes, when the Algerians put together a neat passing move to release right back Aissa Mandi, but his cut-back was sliced so badly by Bentaleb that it ended up going out for a throw-in. Things were not helped by the overly fussy referee Koman Coulibaly, who seemed to think that Belfodil needed only to look at the ball to be penalized, but in truth neither side showed anything like the level of quality needed to win the game. Leicester City’s Riyad Mahrez was introduced midway through the second half, in attempt to reinvigorate the Algerian attack, and he did manage to trouble the Ghana defence soon after, but his shot was comfortably over the bar. It summed up a game which disappointed for 92 minutes, before Gyan brought it to life. Yacine Brahimi (centre) is crowded out by Amartey (left) and Afriyie Acquah during the group match .

"Andy Murray earned himself the opportunity to gain some revenge for what happened at Wimbledon last year after an almost uninterrupted cruise into the last 16 of the Australian Open. The world No 6 now gets a shot at gifted Bulgarian Grigor Dimitrov after swatting away Portugal's Joao Sousa like he was one of the irritating flies one finds in these parts. Murray took two hours and six minutes to overcome the world No 55 6-1 6-1 7-5, and now has a match against the player who knocked him out of last summer's SW19 quarter-final in straight sets. VIDEO Scroll down for Australian Open: Murray beats Sousa 6-1 6-1 7-5, Federer goes out . Andy Murray was rarely troubled as he saw off the limited challenge of Joao Sousa . Murray celebrates on his way to his third straight-sets win of the week in Melbourne . Sousa rallied towards the end of the third set but couldn't sustain his challenge and crashed out . Muray will take on Grigor Dimitrov in the next round, the man who knocked him out of Wimbledon last year . The stakes will be even higher after the shock exit of Roger Federer at the hands of Andreas Seppi, as the world No 2 was due to be awaiting the winner in the quarter-finals. Murray was, for the most part, in imperious form over on the Hisense Arena and played with real aggression. He will need to reproduce that positive outlook to get past world No 11 Dimitrov, who often draws comparisons with the great Swiss. 'It should be a good match, he has improved a lot over the last few years,' said Murray of a player who he beat when they last played, at the Paris Masters, indoors in November. Murray was pleased with his afternoon's work: 'Joao came back into it and played some great shots at the end. My body feels good, although you know it's going to get tougher with every round.' Dimitrov needed to summon up all his resolve to get past Cyprus's Marcos Baghdatis, and took a sapping three hours and 28 minutes before winning 4-6 6-3 3-6 6-3 6-3. Murray by contrast was in complete control bar a brief period in the third set, when his concentration slightly faltered at 4-1 up. Murray will have to improve his serving if he is to go stand a chance of winning the tournament . Murray's groundstrokes were often sublime however and left Sousa with little answer . Kim Sears was in her usual position courtside to watch her fiance make short work of Sousa . He had needed to save an early break point in the third game of the opener, when he served two double faults. From then on he powered ahead, not dropping a further game in the first against Sousa, who needed treatment on his his upper leg when he went 4-1 down in the second. He looked in pain, but seemed to move well thereafter. He could make no inroads, despite Murray's first serve percentage dropping to 43 in the second. The Hisense Arena, a multi-sport venue, is not the most atmospheric, but the excitement levels rose when a revitalised Sousa mounted a fightback when his cause seemed lost. He broke back for 4-3 and, loudly exhorting himself, struck out with nothing left to lose. Murray needed to reassert himself and, and remained admirably disciplined, even when two match points went begging at 5-4. He headed off the threat of a tiebreak with a final break of serve, and reaches the fourth round having expended the minimum of energy. That is just as well for, even with Federer out, sterner tests are coming now, beginning on Sunday. Murray's coach Amelie Mauresmo appeared happy with her charge's work as he made it through .

"Few teenagers could call on the help and advice of an England regular and Premier League winner when they were flung on the non-League scrapheap. But when Bournemouth midfielder Harry Arter found himself released from then top-flight Charlton at 19-years-old and suddenly stranded in the Conference South at Woking, he had a familiar name to turn to. Words of wisdom from brother-in-law Scott Parker, ignored early in his career, pulled Arter from the depths of non-League football oblivion. Bournemouth midfielder Harry Arter (left) says Scott Parker was his inspiration to make it as a professional . The 25-year-old is now on the verge of playing in the Premier League, with Bournemouth top of the Championship, and will test his early potential against top-flight opposition Aston Villa in the FA Cup fourth round on Sunday. 'One regret I have is not taking on board what Scott said when I was a 16 and 17-year-old boy,' Arter admits. 'He warned me of situations that happened and I didn't listen. 'You get put on a pedestal at a young age when you're viewed as a promising player. Scott had seen that for years and years. 'I was just a 16-year-old boy who thought he was a Premier League player. And I was nowhere near a Premier League player. 'There were certain egos at Charlton, if young lads get in with the wrong crowd and look up to the wrong sort of player inevitably they're going to have a bad period for a while and that's what happened to me. 'I was probably looking up to players that at Charlton at that time thought they were better than they were. Scott had tried to warn me, but for whatever reason, probably immaturity, I didn't listen to him.' Arter (right) has since become an integral part in Bournemouth Premier League promotion push this season . Parker, so revered by his critics he was awarded the Football Writers' Association Player of the Year in 2011 and won the Premier League and League Cup double with Chelsea in 2005, is married to Arter's sister Carly. The pair met when Parker was just 15 and staying at the Football Association's School of Excellence at Lilleshall. Introduced by a mutual friend, they have been together ever since and have four children. Arter was only six-years-old at the time they met. None of the family knew that Parker would go on to win 18 England caps, captain his country and play in a European Championships. He grew to become the perfect example – clean-cut, respected and hard-working – to a young Arter, himself yearning to become a professional footballer. But when Arter debuted for Charlton in a League Cup against Luton Town in 2006, he shunned Parker's help. That would be his only game for the south-east London club and after two years, and loan spells at Staines Town and Welling United, his contract came to an end. No-one in the Football League would take him and his career was unravelling. Parker (right) came to prominence at Charlton - something Arter failed to achieve . Later on in his career, Parker (right) was awarded the Football Writers' Association Player of the Year in 2011 . 'When I got to 19 and signed for Woking Scott really came into my life football-wise,' Arter explains. 'He helped keep me motivated and try to stay as professional as I could. 'It was probably more me opening up to him and realising I'm in a bad position and there's someone in my family who deep down I know I should've listened to but I chose not to. 'Eventually once I started taking on his advice I tried to live my life similar to the way he lives his. I feel my career changed and I became more level-headed. I'm sure he gets a lot of satisfaction out of my success.' Bournemouth manager Eddie Howe has been equally as important in his progression. Howe watched just 50 minutes of Arter play in a match for Woking and saw enough to bring him to his side just promoted to League One in 2010. Bournemouth boss Eddie Howe signed Arter in his first spell in charge of the club in 2010 . Howe left for Burnley six months later and Arter struggled with different managers, but has since flourished since Howe returned in 2012. 'I was seen as No 1 hate figure round here for a year or so,' he adds. 'The fans didn't like me. 'Eventually I turned it around and a lot of that was because Eddie played me every week and liked me as a player. 'Eddie Howe could play a man with one leg and the fans would think it was all right, they love Eddie. Whatever he says is right with the fans, which is lucky for me.'","Harry Arter was released from Charlton as a 19-year-old midfielder .

"It is one of those magical moments a footballer seldom gets the chance to experience... a return to the place he once called home. And for Emile Heskey, a man maligned by many, Bolton's FA Cup fourth round trip to Liverpool provided an opportunity to prove himself at the highest level once more. At 37 years of age, it is something Heskey himself admitted he never thought would happen. At the end of last season, he was plying his trade at Australian A-League side Newcastle Jets, meandering towards the end of his career. But the big man had one last stint left in him. He wanted a move back to England, to play out his remaining season or two on home turf. Bolton gave him that opportunity, and alongside Eidur Gudjohnsen - himself 36 - he was tasked with leading the line in the FA Cup. Emile Heskey (right) was involved in a battle with Emre Can (centre) and Liverpool's back three . Heskey (right) worked hard up front for 55 minutes, and was given a standing ovation when he left the pitch . Heskey's heat map shows that he sat on the Liverpool back line to hold the ball up for Eidur Gudjohnsen . It is a cup competition that Heskey holds in high regard. In fact, he won it with Liverpool in 2001. Poetic that he should return to Anfield in perhaps his last season participating in it. His reaction from the crowd pre-match was marvellous - and fully deserved. Anfield loves a returning hero, and four successful years at Liverpool have earned him respect on Merseyside. In truth, Heskey's first-half contribution was minimal. He sat on Liverpool's back line, a relatively imposing three of Emre Can, Mamadou Sakho and Glen Johnson, waiting for his moment. It would be unfair to expect a world-beating performance; those days are gone. Bolton were always going to be on the back-foot, playing on the break after stifling a Liverpool attack, and that proved to be the case. His heat map shows exactly what you'd expect. A dark patch in the middle of Liverpool's half. And his aerial stats, too. 10 contests with a defender, six won. On the floor, he had 11 duels, and won seven of those. He didn't set the game alight, but he provided a presence for Neil Lennon's side. Strength and power, attempting to hold the ball up for Gudjohnsen in behind him. Heskey has fond memories of his time at Liverpool, and is loved by the Anfield faithful . The former Liverpool man's overriding memory of the FA Cup will be winning it with Liverpool in 2001 . Heskey will remember his return to Liverpool, and the reaction he received, for the rest of his life . It was the same in Liverpool's treble-winning season in 2001; Heskey teeing them up, and Michael Owen firing them home. As for Heskey firing one home himself, it wasn't to be. There will have been millions watching from their sofas at home, wanting, waiting, wishing for the ex-England man to put one past Simon Mignolet. Alas, his number was up after 56 minutes, Lennon revealing after the game that Heskey had felt a slight tweak in his hamstring. If more proof was needed of his status on the red half of Liverpool, the whole stadium were on their feet. A standing ovation for the man who evokes proud memories for the Anfield faithful. Memories of an FA Cup, League Cup and UEFA Cup treble-winning campaign. Memories of 60 goals in a Liverpool shirt. Memories of that partnership with Owen. There was no magical moment on Saturday night. Not even close. But it wasn't necessarily about that. It was a moment for Heskey to savour, and one that he deserves after a 21-year career. That long round of applause as he left the Anfield pitch for perhaps the last time as a player is something that will stay with Heskey for the rest of his life.","Emile Heskey spent four years at Liverpool between 2000 and 2004 .

"Brendan Rodgers insisted Liverpool will not endure another summer of wholesale change as he outlined his intention to keep plenty of experience in his squad. Steven Gerrard will leave a hole that cannot be easily filled when he joins LA Galaxy at the end of the season and Rodgers admits Liverpool can ill-afford more key departures. Players such as Jon Flanagan (22), Kolo Toure (33), Glen Johnson (30) and Brad Jones (32) are all in the final six months of their current deals, while Jordan Henderson (24) and Martin Skrtel (30) are established squad members whose terms expire in 18 months. Brendan Rodgers insisted Liverpool will not endure another summer of wholesale change . Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard will, however, leave the club at the end of the season . Rodgers has already said he wants Johnson to stay and Lucas Leiva, the 28-year-old Brazil midfielder who has been courted by Inter Milan, is another player the manager wants to keep as he shapes a squad to challenge for the title. ‘We can’t have (three or four leaving),’ said Rodgers, whose side face Bolton at Anfield on Saturday. ‘You have to realise that if you want success, you have to be unselfish. You have to think about the team. The manager picks the team to win the game. ‘You have to recognise as a manager that it is difficult for players who don’t play. Rodgers insists he wants midfielder Lucas Leiva, who is being targeted by Inter Milan, to stay . Glen Johnson is another player who could leave at the end of the season . ‘I speak a lot with the players but I have shown in my time here that I’m a coach who will view (what you do) in training. Lucas is a prime example.’ Liverpool bought predominantly young players last summer but their interest in, among others, 29-year-old Manchester City midfielder James Milner shows they will broaden their horizons if necessary. ‘I think for younger players to show that potential, they are going to need that seniority around them,’ Rodgers added. ‘You cannot just rely on young players. Players like Glen Johnson we want to keep. Lucas we want to keep.’","Steven Gerrard will leave Liverpool after 18 years this summer .

"Fabian Delph has claimed that him signing a new four-and-a-half year deal deal at Aston Villa proves that loyalty still exists in football. The 25-year-old's previous deal expired in the summer and Liverpool were rumoured to be interested in the midfielder.

'The fans have stuck by since day one. The chairman's stuck by me, he's been unbelievable with me. The gaffer's been great as well. 'I'm proving that there still is loyalty in football. I've decided to stay here and I'll give nothing less than 100 per cent every game. 'I'd love you guys to get behind us and support the boys.'

Delph has ended rumours linking him with a move to Liverpool as a potential replacement for Steven Gerrard . Manager Lambert added: 'It's great for Aston Villa. It's great for Fabian. I think this is a massive, massive step. 'The thing with modern day football and loyalty is there's not so much of it - you very rarely get people who stay at a football club for a long, long time. 'Obviously Fabian has been here a fair few years now. His first few years he was injured as a young guy but since I have been here - the three years - he's been terrific for us. He's been great. His performances have been excellent. 'When you get someone like Fabian - who might have had the possibility of going elsewhere to pastures new - to have him commit is a massive, massive coup for us. 'No-one expected it. I think everyone thought Fabian was going to go and we would have to get someone else in. I don't think anyone saw this coming.

"By the end the Leicester players were all smiles, cavorting in a corner celebrating a famous FA Cup victory in front of their fans. Jeff Schlupp, who might have been at the African Nations’ Cup had the Ghanaian FA pushed harder for his inclusion, was at the centre of a scrum of ecstatic players, as two goals in the last seven minutes plucked an unlikely victory from a day which had seem likely to end in bitter recriminations. And amidst all the joy, even Andrej Kramaric, by then on the bench, might have found a moment to smile. The Croatian striker has only been in England for a fortnight and his first impressions of the country can’t be altogether positive. It was the Croatian striker’s first start, having played 25 minutes last weekend in the defeat to Stoke. At Tottenham he missed a simple chance on ten minutes from close range in an otherwise energetic and good performance but that wasn’t the worst of it. Leicester City scored twice in the final 10 minutes to come from behind and dump Tottenham out of the FA Cup at White Hart Lane .

Tottenham (4-2-3-1): Vorm 6.5, Chiriches 6.5, Fazio 6, Kaboul 6.5, Rose 7; Capoue 6, Dembele 6.5 (Kane 87); Townsend 7.5 (Eriksen 64 - 6), Paulinho 6.5, Lamela 6.5; Soldado 7.5 (Adebayor 71). Subs not used: Friedel, Davies, Dier, Stambouli, Kane. Scorer: Townsend. Leicester (4-2-3-1): Schwarzer 6, Simpson 5.5, Morgan 6, Moore 4.5 (Wasilewski 26 - 6), De Laet 6; Drinkwater 7, King 6.5; Vardy 6 (Nugent 72 - 6.5), Kramaric 7 (Albrighton 73 - 7), Schlupp 8; Ulloa 7.5. Subs not used: Hamer, Konchesky, Cambiasso, Knockaert. Scorers: Ulloa, Schlupp. Booked: Ulloa, Kramaric, Moore. Referee: Robert Madley 4.5. Star man: Jeffrey Schlupp. Att: 35,548. His bewilderment with the mores of our game must have reached a peak on 42 minutes when he sprinted on to a through ball from Danny Drinkwater. For all the late drama, what happened next occupied centre stage of the afternoon’s entertainment. Goalkeeper Michel Vorm came charging out, missed the ball and took the man in the penalty area. A red card and a penalty seemed inevitable. Instead, referee Robert Madley reached with a flourish for a yellow card for diving and pointed in the opposite direction for a Tottenham free kick. Kramaric looked flabbergasted. Nigel Pearson on the bench looked so surprised that he bypassed anger for utter incredulity. Even Vorm looked a little apologetic, placing an arm around Kramaric. ‘He’s a bit bemused by it,’ said Pearson. ‘He didn’t quite understand. But we have to address this situation at some point. It’s an honest mistake. It’s not done on purpose but I’m a big believer in the fact we need to introduce more technology to aid the officials. 'We can have replays and you in th press have monitors and can see incidents very quickly after they occur so there shouldn’t be an issue with having another official who can see replays. ‘I don’t see any point ranting and raving about it – and I suppose you could say it’s easy to say that now you’ve won. But that’s how we were at half time. It happened; we can’t change it. It’s unfortunate but these sort of things can cost people job but if it’s a league game and we lose because of a decision like that, maybe I’d be talking a little bit differently.’ It was key moment which might have deflated worse teams. But to their credit Leicester never folded after that decision and never played like a team whose primary focus must be the Premier League. One-nil down and aggrieved they stuck to their task doggedly and on 83 minutes came the reward. When a corner fell to Schlupp, his attempted shot bounced off the feet of Leanardo Ulloa, but fell kindly for the Argentine who turned and shot from the edge of the box, beating Vorm and racing away in ecstatically to celebrate with the Leicester fans. Still, few were expecting the dramatic denouement. Time added on had just been announced when Danny Simpson broke down the right. He crossed well and Schlupp met it cleanly but still, it remained a relatively simple save for Vorm. Somehow he allowed the ball to squirm under him and then deflected the ball into the net as he attempted to recover. Poor Vorm. Early on he had made fine saves but it would ultimately have been better for him if he had received that first-half red card.

Tottenham's Brazilian midfielder Paulinho takes a shot while Leicester midfielder Andy king attempts to block it . Former Valencia and Getafe forward Roberto Soldado attempts an acrobatic shot on goal during the second half . As for Spurs the decision to make nine changes from the Capital One Cup semi final in midweek surely cost them. The introductions of Christian Eriksen and Harry Kane came too late and that of Emmanuel Adebayor was of limited impact and was greeted by some cheers but plenty of jeers among Tottenham fans. The manager claimed the changes were not the reason for the team’s exit but he now needs to lift them for the second leg against Sheffield United on Wednesday. ‘This is our way from the beginning of the season,’ said Pochettino. ‘I don’t think the changes are a reason to justify the result. We’re very disappointed and upset because when you analyse the game we deserved more. During the game we played well, but you need to kill the game and we always gave Leicester the possibility to stay alive.’ Pochettino has some justification in his claims – Spurs could have won this game but would have had more chance with Kane and Eriksen on from the start.

Spurs did have to survive early scares – that Kramaric miss, which had seen Vorm react superbly to push the ball away and a dipping shot from Schlupp on 17 minutes which Vorm has tipped away one handed. But slowly they established a stranglehold on the game, gradually crafting chances. They were presented with their opening goal from the penalty spot when Liam Moore was tricked into fouling Roberto Soldado, who flicked the ball away to one side while the Leicester defender simply ploughed on with his challenge regardless, taking out the Spaniard. Andros Townsend converted from the spot. Thereafter Tottenham appeared in control without ever dominating. They had the best chances: a header from Soldado on 33 minutes; a strike from Paulinho on 35 minutes; Paulinho should have done better on 70 minutes; and 42-year-old debutant Mark Schwarzer produced an excellent save from Erik Lamela on 79 minutes before Leicester’s dramatic finale.

"Slashing rest days, a new fines system, players treated like kids — Ben Foster has lifted the lid on the Tony Pulis regime at West Bromwich Albion, and insists he’s loving it. According to the England goalkeeper, the secret to West Brom’s revival is Pulis’s insistence on hard work by all, raising fitness levels, and a refusal to give an inch at training. West Brom beat Birmingham courtesy of Victor Anichebe’s brace to make it three wins and a draw since Pulis took charge. And Foster said: ‘If I was a manager, I would be like him. You’ve got to treat football players like kids sometimes. If you give them an inch they will take a mile — it’s amazing. VIDEO Scroll down to see what Ben Foster will no longer be getting away with at West Brom . Tony Pulis continued his West Brom revival with a 1-0 win over Birmingham in the FA Cup . Ben Foster is loving life under new manager Pulis, who he feels is improving the work ethic of the team . ‘He’s on us and it’s what we needed. It is old-fashioned graft but it is great. He lets nobody slack off. ‘Everybody is training to their maximum every day and looking sharper. You can see the difference. ‘We get Sunday off, which is a nice family day, but in the week it’s hard work and it’s a big step up from what we have been doing in recent years. I really like it. Maybe before, coming in on a Monday, you could have taken it easy. Nothing like that is happening now. Nobody gets away with anything. ‘He loves to see players in the gym getting stronger and it stands to reason. If you’re fitter and stronger you will be able to do more on a Saturday afternoon. It is brutal but I love it.’ Pulis is desperate for reinforcements but Foster believes players already at the Hawthorns are improving under the new manager. Victor Anichebe (left) scored the decisive goal as West Brom beat Birmingham 1-0 in the FA Cup . ‘He’s so professional, so thorough, and he thinks everything through, down to the tiniest detail,’ Foster added. ‘If you’re willing to work hard, be professional and do it the right way, you’ll fit in. If not, you haven’t got much of a chance with him. ‘He has set up a brilliant fines system which has already recouped a good bit of money and people won’t be slipping up anymore. It’s good. I can’t go into details!’","Ben Foster believes that Tony Pulis has improved the fitness of the squad .

"The look on Tony Pulis’s face when his West Bromwich Albion team conceded their first goal under his tutelage suggested it will not be happening all too often in future. West Brom are into the next round courtesy of a rare Victor Anichebe double, but Birmingham pulled one back when Jonathan Grounds found space in the area to slip a finish in off the post. At that moment, in first-half injury time, Pulis spun round with anger in his eyes. A cardinal sin had been committed, his defenders too slack.

This was a fixture that excited England’s second city. St Andrew’s was a sell-out for the first time since Birmingham faced Blackpool in the play-off semi final of May 2012. West Brom could have sold many more than their 5,467 allocation, who travelled five miles from west to east. Team selections from both Rowett and Pulis matched the expectation. Each went with largely full-strength line-ups, Ben Foster and Clayton Donaldson the only major players to start on the bench. The pubs and roads around this stadium were packed prior to kick-off with supporters chanting various songs against their local rivals – but in the ninth minute they were united in applause for Jeff Astle. West Brom fans have kept up their campaign calling on the FA to launch research into the effects of heading footballs following the death of their legendary striker. Away from this game, Pulis has his focus on the transfer window – and as if to show the areas he wants strengthening immediately, he played Joleon Lescott at left-back and Craig Gardner on the right wing, shifting Chris Brunt to the middle. After a quiet opening, the match sprung to life in the 25th minute. Craig Dawson won possession and the ball found its way to Saido Berahino. The England Under-21 forward slipped a delicate pass to Anichebe, who shifted his body so Paul Robinson was unable to block his shot, which went in off the near post. Ten minutes later, Anichebe doubled his tally in similar circumstances. Once again Berahino played in his strike partner on the left of the area. Anichebe muscled his way past Robinson and squeezed a finish into the far corner. On neither occasion did goalkeeper Darren Randolph cover himself in glory.

Anichebe, a £6million signing from Everton in August 2013, had only scored four goals prior to the arrival of Pulis. He now has three in four under the Welshman. That seemed to be that. West Brom do not concede under Pulis, and looked secure here until added time in the first half. But Lloyd Dyer, on his debut, escaped the attentions of Andre Wisdom down the Birmingham left and delivered a low cross that somehow reached Grounds by the 12-yard spot. The left-back struck a first-time finish for his first goal in a Birmingham shirt. Pulis spun away with anger in his eyes. Birmingham under Rowett are resilient and made a decent job of a comeback after the interval. The hosts’ cause was aided by three injuries to West Brom players in 15 minutes. First Gardner caught Davod Cotterill’s free-kick flush in his face to require treatment, then Boaz Myhill was forced from the field with an injured hand after being clattered by Dyer. Foster came on to claps from both sets of fans. In the 68th minute Birmingham captain Paul Robnson was fortunate to stay on the pitch when he launched a crude tackle on Stephane Sessegnon that saw Mark Clattenburg produce a yellow card and the West Brom winger substituted.

But Birmingham held the ascendancy the rest of the time. Demarai Gray, the 18-year-old winger, was sent on with 20 minutes to play and enhanced his reputation. With 11 minutes to go he cut inside Gareth McAuley and unleashed a shot that Foster tipped over, and he also brought a fine save from the England goalkeeper with a tremendous drive from distance. In injury time Stephen Gleeson hit one that flew past the post, and Pulis could allow himself a smile.","West Brom defeated Birmingham City 2-1 in their FA Cup fourth round clash at St Andrews .

"The flecks of grey hair betray his advancing years but, even at 37, Emile Heskey does not have to think too far back for his last appearances in a Liverpool shirt. November. Two games against a Singapore Select XI and Thailand Over 30s. Heskey was playing for a Liverpool Legends team and the pre-match preparations were, let us say, not quite what they were in his Anfield heyday. ‘It was different,’ says Heskey, breaking into laughter. ‘I’m used to going to bed at a certain time, especially before a game. Emile Heskey trains with his Bolton team-mates, including Eidur Gudjohnsen (second from the left) Heskey enjoys himself during a recent press conference ahead of his return to Anfield . ‘Robbie Fowler asked if I wanted to play and I thought, “yeah, I’m not doing anything, I’ll come out”. There was me, Robbie, Didi (Hamann), Macca (Steve McManaman), Stephane Henchoz, David Thompson and Patrik Berger. Who kept me up? Everyone.’ Two months on and there have been no more late nights as Heskey, an FA Cup winner with Liverpool 14 years ago, returns to Anfield to face his old club in the fourth round on Saturday as a Bolton Wanderers player. The last few weeks have, he admits, ‘been a bit of a whirlwind’. ‘At 37, would I have been thinking I’d be playing against Liverpool at Anfield? Probably not, but I’m going to relish every moment. ‘It’s going to be great. You get into football for the love of the game and to win trophies, and I managed to do that at Liverpool. I had a wonderful time.’ Heskey’s thoughts were turning to the beach in Antigua when a chance meeting with Neil Lennon, an old Leicester City team-mate, led to an invitation to have a trial for Bolton in an Under 21 game. After leaving the Premier League, Heskey went to play in the A-League with Newcastle Jets . But a chance meeting with former Leicester City team-mate Neil Lennon earned him a move to Bolton . The 6ft 2in former England striker had not played properly for six months since being released by Australian club Newcastle Jets. He was training at Blackburn but Lennon saw enough in the first 15 minutes to know that he could still play in the Championship. Heskey signed a short-term deal on Christmas Eve and scored for his new club against Blackburn two days later, assisted by Eidur Gudjohnsen, another veteran enjoying a new lease of life at Bolton. ‘I tried to sign Emile for Celtic but the big bugger wouldn’t come,’ says Lennon. ‘He didn’t have a choice this time once I got a grip on him.’ Heskey’s career peaked at Liverpool. A battering ram of a centre forward, he scored 60 goals in 223 games after signing for a then club record £11million, and was part of Gerard Houllier’s Treble-winning side that lifted the FA Cup, League Cup and UEFA Cup in 2001. That year he also scored England’s fifth goal in a 5-1 World Cup qualifying win over Germany in Munich. ‘It was a great year and a great time to be playing football,’ he recalls. Success did not follow quite so easily after that, however. In the next eight years, Heskey scored only 38 goals for Birmingham, Wigan and Aston Villa. The former Liverpool striker shakes hands with Arsenal legend Thierry Henry back in 2000 . Heskey playing for current club Bolton (left) and during his days as a Liverpool striker (right) When he retired from international football after the 2010 World Cup, in which he was made the scapegoat for England’s failure under Fabio Capello, he had just seven England goals in 62 games. His advocates point out that he was a target man who brought out the best from a succession of strike partners including Michael Owen and Wayne Rooney. To others he became a figure of fun. When Heskey scored for Bolton last month, local comic Paddy McGuinness had to make good on a bet and clean the striker’s boots. Even the fans’ version of Walking in a Heskey Wonderland includes the line ‘he used to be s***e but now he’s all right’. Lennon is not alone in believing that his old friend has a point to prove, but Heskey says his record speaks for itself: ‘Four League Cups, FA Cup, UEFA Cup, Super Cup, Charity Shield, played in two World Cups, two Euros. That’s not bad. I’m happy. ‘If I could have got more goals, I would have loved to. But it never hindered me from achieving and winning trophies. Heskey scores for Bolton against Blackburn after being set up by fellow veteran striker Gudjohnsen . Heskey revealed he hopes to play for one more year and will enjoy every minute he has left playing . ‘Between 2004 and 2008 I didn’t get picked for England. Then I came back at 30 and played until 32. People asked why I was being picked again but managers were picking me and they were happy.’ Heskey still looks in shape but he is reminded that his new Bolton team-mate Zach Clough was born on the same day that he made his Premier League debut for Leicester in 1995. In the Under 21 trial against Reading, he faced Martin Keown’s son Niall. Did Keown Jnr kick him as well? ‘He tried,’ says Heskey. ‘When I was growing up, everyone was saying that you’re finished at 35. You’ve got that in your mind and when I got to 35, I thought I was finished. ‘But you realise you can play to whatever age you want as long as you change your game and your legs hold out. ‘I’ve seen many players do it. You’ve got Frank Lampard doing it, Didier Drogba, Eidur... Steven Gerrard is 35 in May. Teddy Sheringham played until he was 42. It’s how you live your life. ‘I feel I can play another year. Whether that happens is another thing.’","Emile Heskey signed for Bolton Wanderers this season .

"Andre Schurrle looks set for the Stamford Bridge exit doors after the German midfielder was left out of Jose Mourino's squad to face Bradford City on Saturday. Mourinho insisted the German would feature in the FA Cup fourth round clash with the League One promotion hopefuls, but the winger is nowhere to be seen. Andre Schurrle is rumoured to be closing in on a move to Bundesliga outfit Wolfsburg this January . Schurrle has been heavily linked with a move away from west London in recent weeks with Bundesliga side Wolfsburg keen to snap him up. Reports suggest Chelsea are hoping to receive £27m for the player they signed from Leverkusen in 2013 for £18m, but are in no rush to deal in the transfer window. The Portuguese manager said: 'The principle is that we would like him to stay. 'The question is not to be allowed or not allowed. The question is not to have a good offer. 'The question is to have a phenomenal offer and a player to be super keen to accept a new challenge in his career because we don't want to sell our players.' Jose Mourinho had previously stated that Schurrle would start the game against Bradford City . Wolfsburg are ready to lure the midfielder back to the division in which he started his career with the promise of regular first team football. He has reportedly given fellow senior players the impression that he is ready to leave the club and his sale could free up funds for reported target Juan Cuadrado. The sale of Schurrle could free up welcomed transfer funds for Fiorentina target Juan Cuadrado .","Andre Schurrle has been linked with a move to Bundesliga side Wolfsburg .

"Jack Rodwell was once a highly-rated future England captain, right? Sadly, his career is drifting by. It says everything that Sunderland actually improved following his second-half dismissal. But don’t let that minor upturn mask what was a dreadful match – what must home debutant Jermain Defoe have thought? On this evidence, he’s staring at an awfully long three-and-a-half years on Wearside. Referee Anthony Taylor shows Sunderland midfielder Jack Rodwell the red card after a second bookable offence on Saturday . Rodwell was cautioned for impeding Fulham goalkeeper Marcus Bettinelli to receive a second booking and get sent off . The former Manchester City midfielder's unnecessary challenge on the Fulham keeper reduced the home side to ten men . Rodwell hangs his head as he walks off the pitch having been sent off for Sunderland at the Stadium of Light on Saturday in the FA Cup . Sunderland striker Jermain Defoe looks on with frustration as the home side struggled to break down their Championship opponents . SUNDERLAND (3-5-2): Mannone 6; Vergini 6, O'Shea 6.5, Coates 6; Jones 6 (Buckley 75, 5.5), Larsson 6.5, Bridcutt 6, Rodwell 4, Van Aanholt 6; Fletcher 5 (Wickham 66, 6), Defoe 6.5 . Subs not used: Pantilimon, Gomez, Graham, Alvarez, Giaccherini . Booked: Coates, Rodwell sent off, Buckley . Manager: Gus Poyet 5 . FULHAM (4-4-2): Bettinelli 7.5; Grimmer 6, Hutchinson 6.5, Bodurov 6, Stafylidis 6; Christensen 6, Dembele 5.5 (McCormack 61, 6), Tunnicliffe 6, Fofana 6.5 (Kacaniklic 75, 6); Ruiz 5.5, Woodrow 7 (Rodallega 75, 6) Subs not used: Kiraly, Zverotic, Roberts, Burn . Manger: Kit Symons 6 . Referee: Anthony Taylor . MOTM: Marcus Bettinelli . Attendance: 22,961 . Sunderland fans can only hope he does not regress into the same rut in which Rodwell finds himself. This was only his 12th start since his £10 million arrival from Manchester City, but that fee looks inflated with every sorry showing. The 23-year-old was lucky not to see red for a first-half lunge on Konstantinos Stafylidis, but was given his marching orders for a second yellow when he needlessly impeded goalkeeper Marcus Bettinelli on 66 minutes. Remarkably, Black Cats boss Gus Poyet refused to criticise the three-times-capped midfielder. ‘Sometimes you do things that you would not do again. You don’t have time to think. I’m not bothered about it,’ he said. What Poyet was disturbed by was his side’s lacklustre performance. ‘I’m more bothered about the disconnection with the fans. I think they want Niall Quinn and Kevin Phillips back, but that’s not going to happen,’ he added. ‘The first half was poor and it was difficult to watch. We didn’t pass it well or have the pressure in their half. I wouldn’t like to watch that week in, week out.’ Poyet was right. The first half was everything which has become so disheartening about this competition at times - two teams feigning interest, rendering the contest utterly meaningless. Highlights? Lowlights more like. There was a Patrick van Aanholt shot which smashed new team-mate Defoe flush in the face. That got a laugh, at least. The home crowd were rightly restless at half-time. Despite playing two up front – Defoe and Steven Fletcher – Poyet eroded that positivity by starting with five defenders. It wasn’t until the 56th minute that Defoe registered an effort towards goal – a dipping 25-yard strike dropping way wide. Still, it was progress.

Lasse Christensen of Fulham keeps the ball in on the byline for the Championship side under a challenge from Sebastian Larsson . Sunderland striker Steven Fletcher attempts to hit the target for the Black Cats whilst Nikolay Bodurov of Fulham tries to make a block . And Defoe came a damn sight closer to breaking the deadlock four minutes later when his volley, from Billy Jones’ centre, was shoveled around the post by man-of-the-match Bettinelli. The new signing drew another instinctive stop from the Fulham netminder when flicking Rodwell’s mishit shot on target, Bettinelli reacting to shin clear. From the resulting corner the keeper confidently gathered and, as he strode forward to launch a counter-attack, Rodwell intervened with a mindless tug and was off. Fulham boss Kit Symons – whose side could have nicked it when Hugo Rodallega cracked the post late on – said: ‘The sending-off stirred Sunderland into life if anything. ‘But to come here to a Premier League side and equip ourselves like we did, I can be proud.’ As it is, these two will replay a week on Tuesday – just don’t expect a surge for tickets.

"Jermain Defoe joined Sunderland on Friday after spending a year with Toronto FC, and it seems the MLS outfit may have held a slight grudge against their former  striker. Toronto tweeted ahead of Defoe's Sunderland debut against his ex-club Tottenham Hotspur at White Hart Lane to wish 'our partner Spurs all the best' for the Barclays Premier League match.

"West Ham striker Diafra Sakho faces a ban after the Senegalese FA lodged an official complaint with FIFA. Senegal coach Alain Giresse blasted the 25-year-old on Monday night after he featured for his club side against Bristol City 24 hours earlier, despite pulling out of the Africa Cup of Nations with a back injury. Sakho climbed off the bench to bag the winner in the FA Cup fourth round clash against the League One side, but Senegal officials were not expecting him to play. West Ham striker Diafra Sakho celebrates scoring for West Ham but Senegal were not expecting him to play . Sakho played and scored for West Ham against Bristol City, despite pulling out of the AFCON with an injury . However, Senegalese FA chiefs have spoken to FIFA and demanded they take action, which could mean the summer signing from Metz could be banned by world football's governing body. The tournament in Equatorial Guinea runs until February 8, and although Senegal have already crashed out, FIFA can stop Sakho appearing for the Hammers for the duration of the competition. That means he could miss the Premier League games against Liverpool and Manchester United, while they could issue a fine or an even longer ban. Senegalese fans also want the Hammers booted out of the FA Cup. Sam Allardyce's side travel to West Brom in the fifth round next month.

"Brazil legend Romario has proven his prowess for scoring is not just confined to the six-yard box after netting himself a stunning beauty almost 30-years younger than him. The World Cup winner appears to have found love with 19-year-old American singer Dixie Pratt after proudly posting images of the pair all over social media as they holiday on the Caribbean island of Aruba. The 48-year-old is understood to have met his teenage girlfriend in October 2014 following the end of his marriage to Isabella Bittencourt and uploading images of their daily lives have led to Pratt gaining over 13,000 new followers on her Instagram account.

Pratt has collected thousands of new followers on Instagram after hooking up with Romario in October . Romario posted a group selfie with Pratt on the right-hand side . Although Romario remains a legend in Brazil, the irony of the 29-year age difference in his new relationship is that his young girlfriend was not even born when the prolific striker scored five goals to win his country the 1994 World Cup. The former Barcelona star also won the FIFA World Player of the Year in the same year and continued playing into his late 40s to become the second most prolific goalscorer in football history (behind Austrian-Czech striker Josef 'Pepi' Bican) with over 1,000 strikes to his name.

Romario, who famously struck up a partnership with Bebeto during USA '94, scored 55 goals in 70 appearances for his country - making him the third-highest goalscorer in the Brazilian national team. After starting his career in Brazil, Romario won league titles with both PSV Eindhoven and Barcelona in Europe before spending the majority of the rest of his career in his homeland where he won the Brazilian league title with Vasco da Gama. Romario has since entered into the world of politics where he was elected to the Chamber of Deputies on the Brazilian Socialist Party and played a role in denouncing the 2014 World Cup in Brazil.","Brazil legend Romario has been dating American singer Dixie Pratt .

"If Cardiff City is little more than a shop window these days, then perhaps someone should consider cleaning the glass. It’s hard to imagine anyone being overly impressed by a trip to watch Russell Slade’s side right now. This was just a typical day in the recent life of this stumbling club – it started with John Brayford being sold and Kim Bo-Kyung released; it ended with a limp defeat. They have won two games in 10 in all competitions and a mediocre Championship campaign is all they have left to cling to after this cup exit.

The greater priority at the moment, it seems, is slashing the wage bill by replacing the players of their past two managers with cheaper, lesser lights. Slade summed it up by saying last week: ‘We are not shopping in Harrods anymore.’ After watching Oliver Norwood and Hal Robson-Kanu striker in the second half to cancel out Kenwyne Jones’s opener, supporters started to leave. It is telling that Slade admitted he wanted to joined them. He said: ‘It was probably the most disappointing 45 minutes since I have been here. We have had an honest and frank conversation after the game. ‘I would have probably walked out myself if I was in the crowd in that second period. It was dire. There will be ups and downs in terms of making progress but this is a bad day for us.

He said: ‘It feels better this time. We tweaked the mentality at half-time went on the front foot and deserved to win. ‘We just had a quiet chat to put one or two things right. We reminded them of their responsibilities when they cross the line and play for those fans.’ Clarke made only two changes to the side that lost against Fulham in the Championship, but even with a strong side they barely made a dent in the first half. Norwood curled over after 11 minutes and Gareth McCleary cut in from the right moments later before hitting a bouncing shot straight at Simon Moore. Neither moment was particularly threatening. Cardiff were no better. Having gone from functional under Malky Mackay to attacking under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, they are back where they started, just not nearly so effective. Certainly, the transitions and overhauls have been costly in a number of senses. Cardiff boss Russell Slade looks on from the touchline before his side's FA Cup home tie against Reading . Slade's counterpart Reading boss Steve Clarke always watches on prior to kick-off . The momentum for this club seems distinctly negative, though they at least had a lead to shout about in this fixture. As has so often been the case, it was Kenwyne Jones, the club’s biggest earner but also their leading threat, who did the damage. Peter Whittingham hooked in a corner from the left and the Trinidadian’s header was excellent. He has six goals in eight games and 12 for the season – the club’s fortunes would be bleaker if he, too, is erased from the balance sheet. But a single cog can only do so much. Cardiff had a man less in midfield and the pressure built until Norwood levelled in the 64th minute with a free-kick. Hal Robson-Kanu came off the bench and immediately forced a good save before he flicked the winner two minutes from time. Reading’s upward curve under Clarke continued; a strange season for Cardiff just got a little bit worse.","Hal Robson-Kanu completes Reading comeback with 88th minute winner .

"Italian international midfielder Sebastian Giovinco joined Major League Soccer side Toronto FC on Monday as the club continued its closed season shakeup by bringing in yet another high-priced designated player. Giovinco's signing comes three days after the team announced United States striker Jozy Altidore had completed his move from Sunderland to Toronto as part of a deal in which former England forward Jermain Defoe moved in the opposite direction. Altidore, 25, and Giovinco, 27, will team up with United States international Michael Bradley, 27, who last year moved back from Europe for a big-money deal, giving the Canadian club a trio of young talents to build around. Italian international Sebastian Giovinco has joined Toronto FC in the MLS . Toronto have been in MLS for eight seasons but have yet to reach the playoffs despite investing heavily in players and coaching staff. 'Seba is in the prime of his career and he has chosen to join Toronto FC and MLS at a time when many of the top clubs in the world were pursuing him,' Toronto FC General Manager Tim Bezbatchenko said in a statement. Giovinco, known as the 'Atomic Ant' because of his speed and diminutive stature, will join Toronto FC, whose season starts in March, at the conclusion of the Italian Serie A season. Jermain Defoe recently left Toronto the rejoin the Premier League in a move to Sunderland . Defoe made his debut for Sunderland against Tottenham after his move from the MLS . He is currently in his sixth season at Juventus, where he has made a combined 130 appearances, scoring 20 goals with 23 assists helping the club to back-to-back Serie A crowns in 2013 and 2014. The former Parma player has been out of favour at Juve under coach Massimiliano Allegri, appearing in only six league games with two starts. 'I have heard so many great things about Toronto over the years and I know that it will be a city that I feel right at home in,' said Giovinco. 'Until then, I have many things I still want to accomplish for Juventus and our fans. I will always give my heart and soul for Juve until I change shirts this summer.'","Toronto FC sign Italian midfielder Sebastian Giovinco .

"LA Galaxy star Robbie Rogers has again hit out at FIFA, saying the decision to host the World Cup in both Russia and Qatar is a 'kick in the balls' for homosexual athletes around the world. The former Leeds United player has made 18 appearances for the USA at international level, but concedes the decision to hold tournaments in these countries makes it difficult for gay professional athletes to compete. And Rogers, who became the first professional football player in Britain to come out since Justin Fashanu in 1990, believes it is about time football's governing body lived up to their own mission statement. Los Angeles Galaxy's Robbie Rogers came out in 2013 before spending a short time in retirement . 'The decision to hold the World Cup in Russia and then in Qatar seems a little bit crazy to me to be totally honest, it's ignorant, very ignorant,' said Rogers at an MLS media event. 'They're meant to be trying create a better world through soccer and educations through communities, everybody under the roof of football.' Homosexuality is illegal in Qatar and in 2013 Russian president Vladimir Putin signed into a bill that banned the 'propaganda of non-traditional sexual relations to minors'. Rogers (left) now plays in Major League Soccer and tasted glory last season as the Galaxy won the MLS Cup . Rogers added: 'By holding the World Cup in those countries you are not sending that message. You're sending a message that is a bit discriminatory I believe. I think human rights in general in those countries is not spot on . 'But it's tough being an openly gay athlete, it's tough for me as somebody who has played at international level with a national team to see those decisions being made. 'It's a kick in the balls to be honest.'

"At 16 years of age, Martin Odegaard is a Real Madrid player and earning a reported £80,000 per week. The boy done good, you might just about say. What comes next? We hope his undeniable talent bears fruit at Real and he becomes a global great. Theoretically, though, Odegaard could put his feet up and still become a millionaire many, many times over. Plenty of teen prodigies have come before and failed to live up to the hype. The spotlight proves too much or the ability turns out to have been exaggerated. Considering Real’s outlay and the esteem Odegaard holds among the likes of Bayern Munich, Liverpool and Arsenal, the signals suggest he will continue his path to glory. As a cautionary tale, however, Sportsmail looks at some of those who fell short of expectations. Norwegian teenage sensation Martin Odegaard has agreed a deal to join Real Madrid . Freddy Adu . The ultimate story of unfulfilled promise perhaps. That is not to sound like schadenfreude, simply an assessment of how a dream lost lustre in reality. At 14, Adu was the youngest athlete to sign a professional contract in US sport when drafted by DC United. He was twice named in the MLS All-Star team and expected to lead his nation at World Cups. Having had a trial with Manchester United, he eventually arrived in Europe at Benfica. That did not go well, nor spells at Monaco, Belenenses, Aris or Caykur Rizespor. His work-rate was questioned and his career bottomed out when struggling Blackpool failed to find cause to give him a deal a year ago. Now 25, he is without a club having seen a six-month contract with Serbian outfit Jagodina end. He does have nearly 400,000 followers on Twitter, mind. Freddy Adu was the youngest person to sign a professional contract in US sport when drafted aged 14 . Adu was expected to lead the USA for the foreseeable future but failed to realise his potential . Adu had a trial with Manchester United in 2006 (left) and moved to Europe with Benfica . Cherno Samba . Most famous among computer gamers for being a cast-iron success on Championship Manager, Samba’s real-life exploits were as solid only as mercury. Born in Gambia, he came to England at an early age and performed with such style for Millwall that the club rejected a £2million offer from Liverpool under Gerard Houllier. He played for every England youth level up to Under 20s, but his talent failed to keep pace with his ego and in 2004 he was released by Millwall, beginning a tour of football’s lesser lights. Time at Cadiz, Plymouth, Wrexham, Haka, Panetolikos and Tonsberg came and went. He did play for Gambia’s senior side, even scoring once, but now aged 29 is unattached. Gambia-born Cherno Samba in action for England Under 16s against France . Nii Lamptey . Probably football’s clearest fable, a byword for the pitfalls that can afflict young talent. Born in Ghana, Lamptey was voted player of the tournament in the 1991 World Youth Cup featuring Argentina's Juan Sebastian Verón and Italy's Alessandro del Piero. Pele hailed Lamptey his natural heir. Anderlecht brought him to Europe and the Belgian FA changed rules so he could play in the club’s first team aged 16. He got a goal on his European debut and was top scorer in Holland when he moved to PSV Eindhoven. Ron Atkinson signed him for Aston Villa and Coventry but Lamptey failed to shine as anticipated and his star drifted south. He tried seven different countries to resurrect his career but failed. 'When Pele said I could go on to become like him, it was a great honour for me,' Lamptey has said. ‘But it had its negative side - everywhere I went I was supposed to live up to very high standards. Once I couldn't meet people's expectations, I was considered a failure.' Ghanaian midfielder Nii Lamptey felt weighed down by comparisons with Brazilian great Pele . Sonny Pike on the Fantasy Football League show . Sonny Pike . The nephew of former Tottenham striker Marc Falco hit the headlines aged seven when Ajax plucked him from Leyton Orient’s youth team in the early 90s. Dressed in the kit of the Dutch giants and with long, flowing hair, he took part in a curious segment with David Baddiel and Frank Skinner on their Fantasy Football League show to discuss his ambitions. But the pressure of top-level football affected him mentally and he required therapy, before quitting the game for good in 2003. He went on to study psychology at Dundee University in pursuit of a ‘normal’ life. Michael Johnson . More than words, the photograph that emerged in January 2013 of this once cult hero told Johnson’s story. The face podgy, the eyes sad, his picture captured on a night out led to the revelation his £25,000-per-week contract with Manchester City had been cancelled and his career effectively over at 25. Sven Goran Eriksson said he would be an England star. Others called him the new Colin Bell. Severe injuries which led to a lax physical condition put paid to those hopes. A City academy graduate and local lad, he excited fans during the 2007-08 campaign with two goals in 25 lung-busting displays. Abdominal and knee injuries curtailed his ‘big talent’ – the words of Roberto Mancini – and he made just four appearances for City in his final five seasons. Michael Johnson pictured in January 2013 on a night out as his Manchester City career fell apart . Sven Goran Eriksson and Roberto Mancini were full of praise for Johnson, but his City contract was cancelled . Federico Macheda . Introduced himself to the Premier League aged 17 with a stunning goal to win a dramatic game against Aston Villa in the final minute and get Manchester United’s 2008-09 title bid back on track. On the brink of losing a third consecutive match, Macheda sent a curling shot past Brad Friedel. He scored the winner against Sunderland in his next league match too, setting up his promise – but subsequently failed to make a genuine impact. Loan spells at Sampdoria, QPR, Stuttgart and Doncaster hardly inspired, before a slight bounce at Birmingham. Now aged 23, he is on Cardiff’s books and looking to build his career. Federico Macheda announced his arrival in 2009 with a goal that swung the title pendulum in United's favour . Macheda has had a number of loan spells, including Doncaster (above), and is now on the books at Cardiff . Savio Nsereko . The one all West Ham followers know well. Signed for £9m in 2009 as the club’s Icelandic owners rolled the dice, Savio arrived with pedigree as a Germany Under 21 international. But he failed to score in a spell that was curtailed after six months with Fiorentina spending less than a third of the fee West Ham had paid. Karren Brady later investigated the transfer. Savio never played for the Italians, and flopped at six clubs on loan, ending up at Atyrau in Kazakhstan. In late 2012, he was arrested in the Thai resort of Pattaya on a false kidnap claim, having reportedly attempted to extort money from his family as ransom. Previously, at Juve Stabia, Savio was reported missing after going AWOL from training. Interpol later joined the search. Savio turned up, but the talent which had convinced West Ham to splash the cash was never found. Savio Nsereko arrived at West Ham with a big reputation in 2009 but left six months later . Kerlon . The Brazilian made a name for himself at Cruzeiro with his ‘seal dribble’ – nodding the ball with his head while running at opponents. Some found it disrespectful, Inter decided to bring him to Serie A. It did not go to plan. Injuries curtailed his opportunities and set off a nomadic journey, sparked by Jose Mourinho sending him to Ajax. Parana and Nacional followed. He had a reasonably successful spell with Fujieda – a lowly Japanese team – before moving to Weymouth Wales in Barbados. Still aged just 26, it is not the outpost expected when starring for Brazil’s Under 17s. Kerlon was brought to Serie A by Inter Milan from Cruzeiro in 2008 but failed to make his mark in Europe . Nicklas Bendtner . It may seem harsh to include the Dane on a list of failed prodigies, but given he laid claim to being one of the world’s best strikers from a young age the gauge is set to a higher configuration. Having made his Asrenal debut aged 17 - a decade ago now – we are still left wondering where the confidence came from to make his bold statement. Bendtner joined Wolfsburg on a free after Arsene Wenger tried for numerous seasons to offload a player who was, somehow, on £50,000 per week. The numbers show he scored 45 goals in 171 games during his time at Arsenal, hardly elite standard, and then there was the hellraiser attitude – topped when he was arrested for smashing windows in a gym at his luxury apartment complex. Nicklas Bendtner never lived up to his claim of being one of the world's leading strikers at Arsenal . Anderson . A man whose terrace chant far outweighs his on-field activities. Hailed by United fans as the ‘midfield magician who s**** on Fabregas’ following his early performances in a red shirt – notably at Anfield in December 2007 when Steven Gerrard got the runaround – he now cannot even find a club to sign him. It looked so special when signed for £20m from Porto aged 19. He scored a penalty full of character in the 2008 Champions League final shootout against Chelsea. But an alleged fondness for fast food has led to fitness problems and he will leave Old Trafford this summer, at the latest, having never redeemed the adulation.

"Andy Murray is taking on the whole of Australia on Tuesday, although his local hero opponent actually has ambitions to become an Essex man. Nick Kyrgios, carrying the hopes of a nation as he tackles Murray in the Australian Open quarter-final, is house-hunting around the Epping area as he plans the next step in his blossoming career. Although his clash with Murray has been built up along the lines of the Ashes, the 19-year-old from Canberra has quite a few British connections which are likely to get stronger as he plans his career. Scotland's Andy Murray marches on at the expense of Grigor Dimitrov after a tough game in Australia . Murray had to dig deep to see off the challenge of Dimitrov (left) at Melbourne Park . The heir apparent to the likes of Rod Laver, Pat Cash and Lleyton Hewitt knows that having a base outside Australia is essential, and Essex seems to fit the bill. Known as ‘Wild Thing’ due to his animated on-court personality, which includes a tendency to swear and smash his rackets, there are some mixed feelings about Kyrgios in his home country, rather like there were with Cash and Hewitt. ‘He’s not won anything yet has he?’ harrumphed one veteran Australian Grand Slam champion, before adding that he nonetheless believed Kyrgios to be ‘the real deal’. This ambivalence among some partly explains why Kyrgios has yet to play on the main Rod Laver Arena, the venue of the match against Murray starting at 8.15am UK time. Nick Kyrgios has a penchant for shouting, gold necklaces and snazzy hair . Now a tall, lean athlete, Kyrgios was not quite so trim in his youth . Imagine a British teenage sensation getting to the Wimbledon quarter-finals without having played on the Centre Court. His absence from there has been partly because Australia’s tennis hierarchy do not want him to get too carried away with himself, and they have handed Murray a small advantage due to his familiarity with the arena. It could be that, like Cash, Kyrgios finds himself being able to relax more in London, where he enjoyed his finest hour by beating Rafael Nadal at Wimbledon last year. His associations include having a British manager and training occasionally at the Gosling Tennis Centre in Welwyn Garden City. He is also a Tottenham supporter and his sister Halimah, a singer and actress, has lived in Canary Wharf for several years. Kyrgios falls to the ground as he celebrates winning his fourth round match against Andreas Seppi . The Australian media are somewhat divided on Kyrgios, admiring his extravagant shot-making and fighting instincts, but unsure what to make of his blingy persona, stripy haircut and emotional outbursts. His manager John Morris knows him better than most, having signed him up to his company Global Tennis Connections as a 15-year-old. ‘Basically he is a great lad with a big heart,’ Morris said. ‘Of course he is still young and there has been a lot for him to handle in a short space of time. ‘The Sunday before the tournament started we were not even sure whether he was going to play due to back problems, so really he does not have much to lose against Andy — he can go out there and enjoy himself.’ A fired up Kyrgios came from behind to to beat Italian player Seppi (pictured) on Sunday . Kyrgios, whose painter-decorator father is of Greek heritage and whose mother is originally from Malaysia, loves the big occasion and is a player you cannot take your eyes off. During his five-set comeback win against Andreas Seppi on Sunday he spotted three fans sneaking out of the stadium and shouted: ‘Oi! Where are you going?’ He told another spectator making a surreptitious call: ‘Get off your f***ing phone!’ Kyrgios, who showed plenty of promise as a basketball player before concentrating on tennis, also shows his fondness for the big time in his results since emerging from the Challenger circuit to make such a splash at Wimbledon. He made the quarter-finals at SW19 and the third round of the US Open before his run here, but strangely has won only one match on the regular ATP Tour apart from that. Australia's Bernard Tomic takes a shot in the fourth round of the Australian Open tennis tournament . It is still enough to have propelled him to what will be a minimum ranking of 35, regardless of how he fares against Murray — far ahead of any other teenager. His natural power is something uncoachable and, going into the last eight he had hit 97 aces, more than any other player in the tournament. In Australia they also know that he is in the vanguard of a young generation who are set to revive the country’s proud tennis heritage, which for too many years has been over-reliant on the fading force of Hewitt. Along with Kyrgios there is the mercurial Bernard Tomic and 18-year-old Thanasi Kokkinakis, with all three having genuine top-10 potential. Murray sees something of his younger, more tempestuous self in today’s opponent and understands the pressures of performing at your home Grand Slam. Provided Murray is able to reproduce the outstanding form he showed in dismissing Grigor Dimitrov from the fourth round, it will surely be enough to subdue the explosive power of the young Australian, and the huge support he will enjoy.

"Rafael Nadal insists his amazing record against Tomas Berdych will count for nothing when the pair clash in the quarter-finals of the Australian Open. Nadal had to save six break points in the opening set of his fourth-round clash with Kevin Anderson before easing to a 7-5 6-1 6-4 victory, while Berdych saw off home hope Bernard Tomic 6-2 7-6 (7/3) 6-2 on Sunday. Third seed Nadal has an 18-3 career record against Berdych, who won three of their first four meetings but has lost the last 17 in a row. Rafael Nadal insists his amazing record against Tomas Berdych will count for nothing when the pair play . 'It doesn't matter what happened in the past. It is a different story this time,' Nadal said. 'Different moment for me, different moment for him. The way we arrive to that match is not going to affect what happens in the match. I'm sure of that. 'He's a great player. I have success against him, but I have the chances to lose against him. I remember in 2012 I had a very, very tough match against him here (in the quarter-finals). I was close to being two sets to love down. He's a player that is top level.' Nadal admitted he thought of quitting during his second-round match with American Tim Smyczek on Wednesday, the Spaniard suffering from dizziness and nausea as he fell two sets to one behind. However, the nine-time French Open champion dug deep to win in five sets and looks to be working his way back to form and full fitness after the latter half of 2014 was ruined by a wrist injury and appendicitis. The 28-year-old continues to play down his chances of winning a second Australian Open title, but added: 'It's very special to be in the quarter-finals after a tough period of time for me, it's a fantastic result. Third seed Nadal has an 18-3 career record against Berdych, who won three of their first four meetings . 'I am not a person that I am happy like this and that's it. I try to play better and better every day. 'If that happens, I hope to keep having chances for the next match. But today is a day to be happy the way that I improved my level of everything, all the things I have to do on court. Today I was much closer (to) what I have to do to try to have success.' Berdych, who lost to eventual champion Stan Wawrinka in the semi-finals here last year, has yet to drop a set but admitted he would still need 'something extra' against Nadal. 'I'm feeling very good,' the 29-year-old said. 'It's been a great, great run so far. I just put myself in the best possible position right now. 'I'm going to have to add something extra again. That's how the tournament is developing, just move forward, just be ready for it.' Berdych hopes new coach Dani Vallverdu, who formerly worked with Britain's Andy Murray, will provide an effective scouting report on Nadal, and added: 'He is very good on that. Nadal admitted he thought of quitting during his second-round match with American Tim Smyczek . 'He knows how to put up the plan before the match and how to prepare the player. That's what I was looking for and what I needed.' The match with Tomic was played on Margaret Court Arena and the Australian admitted he was amazed not to have played any of his four matches on Rod Laver Arena, the equivalent of Centre Court at Wimbledon. 'I think the scheduling was ridiculous this year. Not just from my side, but for many players,' Tomic said. 'I don't know who was in charge of the schedule. Really, some of the matches I saw it was just like, 'Wow'.' There was better news for the home fans when teenager Nick Kyrgios staged a brilliant comeback to beat Andreas Seppi in five sets and become the first Australian man to reach the quarter-finals since Lleyton Hewitt in 2005. Seppi had caused the shock of the tournament by knocking out Roger Federer in the previous round and carried on where he left off on Hisense Arena, winning the first two sets 7-5 6-4. Czech star Berdych saw off home hope Bernard Tomic 6-2 7-6 (7/3) 6-2 on Sunday . Kyrgios took the third set 6-3 and saved a match point in the fourth before winning it in a tie-break to force a decider which he eventually won 8-6 to send the partisan crowd wild - so much so that play was temporarily halted on the adjacent Rod Laver Arena due to the noise. The match in progress there between sixth seed Andy Murray and 10th seed Grigor Dimitrov was eventually won by Murray, who said: 'I heard a lot of noise and I had to ask my box what it was. 'They told me Kyrgios had just won and I am going to have to play a great match to win against him.' While 19-year-old Kyrgios said: 'It's crazy. I don't think it's sunk in yet. 'When I saw I had finally won the match it was incredible. It was the best feeling I ever had. To know the body could come back from two sets to love, knowing I haven't had matches, it's just massive confidence. 'I drew on my experience from Wimbledon last year, coming back from two sets down against (Richard) Gasquet. I knew I had the legs to do it.'","Rafael Nadal faces Tomas Berdych in the Australian Open quarter-final .

"Novak Djokovic ensured seven of the top eight seeds reached the quarter-finals of the Australian Open after overcoming Luxembourg's Gilles Muller in Melbourne on Monday. Djokovic cut a frustrated figure as he was made to work hard for a 6-4 7-5 7-5 win on Rod Laver Arena, the world No 1's mood perhaps not improved by knowing he faces more of the same big serving from Milos Raonic in the last eight. 'It gets easier and easier with opponents and their serves,' Djokovic joked in an on-court interview with four-time grand slam winner Jim Courier. 'Milos has been playing the tennis of his life in the last 15 months. We are good friends and practice a lot together. He is one of the new generation of stars.'

A single break of serve was enough for Djokovic to win each set against Muller, although the top seed had to save four break points midway through the third set and appeared unhappy with the lack of grip from his footwear on several occasions. 'Not playing Gilles before it was tricky coming in,' Djokovic added. 'I did not know what to expect. I knew he had struggled with injuries recently but he beat some top players here and deserved a lot of respect. 'I was fortunate to serve very well in important moments in the third set. It was very hard to read his serve and he has a lot of variety in his game.' Roger Federer was surprisingly the only top seed not to advance to the last eight, the 17-time grand slam winner having lost in the third round, with fourth seed Stan Wawrinka, fifth seed Kei Nishikori and eighth seed Raonic all winning on Monday.

'It was a real battle today,' Wawrinka said. 'I was two sets up with a break and in the end I'm happy to get through. There was a good level of tennis in general and it's good to make one more win. 'At this level, things can change quickly. I did maybe two mistakes, then he start to play a little bit faster, a little bit more flat. I started to be defensive a little bit too much. 'Losing 5-0 was a bad start to the tie-break. At 6-2 I knew it was close to come back because I had the wind with me. I had to focus on every point.

"Dom Inglot, the hulking British doubles specialist from Middlesex, caused a major upset in the Australian Open doubles when he and Romanian partner Florin Mergea ousted top seeds the Bryan brothers. The 28 year-old from Chiswick, nicknamed Dom the Bomb due to his huge serve, scored the best win of his career when he knocked out the formidable Americans 7-6, 6-3 to reach the quarter finals. Dom Inglot and Florin Mergea of Romania talk tactics at the Australian Open . Mergea (left) and Inglot are in only their seventh tournament as a pair . Standing 6ft 5in, Inglot held firm as they broke the six-times champions and the world's outstanding pair twice in the match to pull off the shock after taking the tiebreak 7-4. Former Wimbledon junior champion Mergea kept his nerve in the final game to serve it out and they now meet Holland's Jean-Julien Rojer and Romania's Horia Tecau. Inglot, coached by another Brit in Nick Cavaday, may have given Davis Cup captain Leon Smith exactly the kind of headache he wants ahead of the World Group first round against the USA in Glasgow in March. Bob Bryan  and Mike Bryan celebrate a point in their third round doubles match against Inglot and Mergea . The world champion Bryans are sure to be the American doubles pairing there, and while Jamie Murray's fine early-season form has pushed him into contention Inglot could challenge him with this victory under his belt. The Bryans have won the Australian Open six times, but could not combat the combination of Inglot's power game and the solid rallying skills of the more diminutive Romanian from the baseline. Inglot and Mergea, who needed to recover from 1-4 down in the first set, are playing only their seventh tournament together after teaming up following the US Open. Inglot, who had broken up with his long-term partner Treat Huey, asked the Romanian for the number of Portugal's Joao Sousa, and the Romanian suggested they try out as a pairing. The Bryan brothers were shocked as they were beaten in straight sets by Inglot and Mergea . This was their most spectacular success to date: 'As a player the Bryans are the one team who you don't want to be near in the draw, you don't really want to play them. They know how to put pressure on and you have always got to beat them,' said Inglot. 'You have got to be aggressive and push hard against them, and that's what we did. Inglot and Mergea came from 1-4 down in the first set to win in straight sets . 'If you leave the door ajar they will push through. Our coach Nick (brother of Naomi Cavaday) is very thorough and we were well prepared. Bob and Mike have certain places they like to return and we weren't going to give them what is their bread and butter.' Of the Davis Cup he said: 'Leon likes to keep his cards close to his chest. I haven't spoken to him about this tie. I haven't played with Andy and maybe he would feel like he knows what he is going to get with his brother. I would love to play and if Leon calls me that's great but for now I'm focussed on here.'","Dom Inglot and Florin Mergea beat Bob Bryan and Mike Bryan 7-6, 6-3 .

"This time 12 months ago Heather Watson arrived in Australia off the back of a season wrecked by glandular fever and needing to qualify for a place in the opening grand slam of 2014. She flew into town on Saturday as one of the early form horses of the WTA Tour, armed with her second career title of the main circuit and a career-high world ranking. The 22-year-old Guernsey right-hander will be confirmed on Monday at No 38 — one above her career best — courtesy of a 6-3, 6-4 victory over American Madison Brengle in the final of the Hobart International on Saturday. A beaming Heather Watson celebrates after winning the Hobart International - her second WTA title . Watson celebrates after securing victory and a career-high ranking of No 38 ahead of the Australian Open . The Great Briton plays a forehand during her singles final match against Madison Brengle of the USA . That means a rise of more than 80 places in the past year as, in the prolonged absence of the injured Laura Robson, she remains in a league of her own as far as Britain’s women are concerned. By adding to the Osaka event she claimed in late 2012, she becomes the first British female to win two events on the main circuit since Anne Hobbs in 1985. Watson undoubtedly benefited from the prior week of top-class competition representing Great Britain with Andy Murray in the Hopman Cup mixed team event. ‘It was a great week in Perth. I really enjoyed it. Being there as Andy’s team-mate definitely gave me a boost of confidence,’ she said. ‘I feel like I’m using everything to play good, positive tennis and I’m coming out with good results. ‘I like to have a title to my name, so I’m very pleased to get that today.’ The Briton beat America's Madison Brengle 6-3 6-4 in the final in Hobart during a rain-interrupted match . Watson needed much of her customary pluck to overcome qualifier Brengle and collect the £28,000 winner’s cheque and 280 ranking points. She faced 12 break points in the first two games and went behind before settling down to master the Tasmanian wind better than her opponent. While Brengle, ranked 84, was not the most terrifying prospect in a WTA final at this level, the Channel Islander had earned her passage with an eye-catching thrashing earlier in the event of a more celebrated American, Sloane Stephens. It is a reminder that her chief virtues of baseline aggression, outstanding athleticism and a strong temperament can carry her considerably higher than her present mark. The Hobart win should lift Watson to a career-high ranking of 38 as she heads to Melbourne . After a somewhat deflating final third of last season when she struggled to string wins together, Watson should be able to push her ranking further, having already banked some decent points early on. Her opponent in the first round in Melbourne will be the 67th-ranked Bulgarian Tsvetana Pironkova, whose main career distinction has been her disproportionate expertise at Wimbledon, where she reached the semi-finals in 2010. ‘I didn’t look at who I was going to play in Melbourne until I was done in Hobart because I wanted Hobart to be my main focus until I was done,’ said Watson. ‘I’ve played Pironkova now three times. We always have really good, competitive, long matches. It won’t be easy.’ In the long run it would doubtless help Watson, who spent her teenage years in Florida after realising that Guernsey was too remote to seriously hone her tennis skills, if Robson can get back to resume their British rivalry. Celebrating her 21st birthday next week, this event marks a year since Robson last played on the tour before succumbing to a wrist injury that ultimately required an operation. While she is back training hard in Florida, caution continues to be the watchword with the former junior Wimbledon champion.

"Venus Williams will face a player she inspired to take up tennis after reaching her first grand slam quarter-final since 2010 in the Australian Open. Williams defeated sixth seed Agnieszka Radwanska 6-3 2-6 6-1 on Rod Laver Arena to set up a last-eight clash with American teenager Madison Keys, who had earlier beaten compatriot Madison Brengle in straight sets. Keys, 19, has made no secret of her admiration for the Williams sisters, although it is something the siblings might not like being reminded of too often. VIDEO Scroll down for Australian Open: Venus Williams wins 6-3 2-6 6-1 vs Radwanska . Venus Williams has reached her first Grand Slam quarter-final since the 2010 Australian Open . The elder Williams sister celebrates after dispatching sixth seed Agnieszka Radwanska 6-3 2-6 6-1 . 'Apparently she started playing because she watched Serena and I,' said the 34-year-old Venus. 'She was watching me in diapers.' Serena Williams (1) vs Dominika Cibulkova (11) Madison Keys vs Venus Williams (18) Ekaterina Makarova (10) vs Simona Halep (3) Eugenie Bouchard (7) VS Maria Sharapova (2) Venus' last quarter-final appearance in a grand slam came in the US Open in 2010, the year before she was diagnosed as suffering from Sjogren's syndrome, a debilitating autoimmune disease. Keys was just five years old when Venus won the first of her seven grand-slam singles titles at Wimbledon in 2000 and is relishing the prospect of facing one of her childhood heroes. 'I'm just really excited,' she said. 'I think it's a huge opportunity for me. I haven't been in this situation before. I'm going to make the most of it. I want to be at the end of the tournament holding the trophy up. That's my goal in the long run. 'I think Venus has helped the sport, especially the women's side with equal prize money. She was a huge part of that. Just watching her is inspirational. She's had her health battles but she loves tennis. She's still out here and she's doing it remarkably well. I hope I can be someone similar to that.' 19-year-old Madison Keys will come up against her childhood hero in the last eight in Melbourne . The American youngster signs autographs after beating compatriot Madison Brengle in straight sets . Keys could have to face both Williams sisters if she wants to win the title, with Serena taking on Dominika Cibulkova in the other quarter-final in the top half of the draw. Top seed Serena had some help from her fans to thank for overcoming another slow start - and a coughing fit - to defeat Spain's Garbine Muguruza in three sets and gain a measure of revenge for her defeat at the hands of the 24th seed in the second round of last year's French Open. Muguruza won 6-2 6-2 at Roland Garros and threatened to do the same here as she won four games in a row from 2-2 in the opening set. Williams, who had to save three set points against Vera Zvonareva in round two and then came from a set down to defeat Elina Svitolina, won the second set 6-3 to level the match and then crucially held serve at the start of the decider. The world No 1 had to save six break points in an epic game lasting 13 minutes and promptly broke a disheartened opponent on her way to taking the set by a flattering 6-2 scoreline. Williams admitted the shouted advice of one spectator to 'use spin' helped her turn the match around, adding: 'She (Muguruza) played so well and she did everything she needed to do in the first set. Serena Williams overcame a slow start to gain revenge over her French Open conqueror Garbine Muguruza . The world No 1 stretches for a shot en route to a comeback 2-6 6-3 6-2 victory in the fourth round . 'I just decided to do my best and stay focused and stay relaxed. She hits the ball really, really big and hard, but someone in the crowd was like 'Use spin'. I was like 'Okay' and it really helped me.' Williams struggled with a cough during the match and the 33-year-old said she had been 'a little sick the past couple of days'. She added: 'I've been fighting it with vitamin C and all kinds of stuff. I definitely feel better than yesterday.' Cibulkova reached the last eight after a see-saw battle with former champion Victoria Azarenka under the roof on Rod Laver Arena. A morning rain shower quickly cleared but the roof remained closed for the duration of a hard-fought fourth-round clash which Cibulkova eventually won 6-2 3-6 6-3. 'I just walked on court and all the great memories come to my mind,' said Cibulkova, who lost to Li Na in last year's final. 'I just have to believe in myself and that's what I am doing right now. 'The first set I was killing her from the forehand and then she started stepping inside the court and to serve much better. I felt like I had to put in something extra and play really, really good and that's what I did.' Williams will face Dominika Cibulkova (right) after she defeated former champion Victoria Azarenka (left) Azarenka, who won the title in 2012 and 2013 but was unseeded this year due to an injury-plagued 2014, led 2-0 in each set but lost six games in a row in the opening set and six out of seven in the decider. 'I take it as progress,' she said. 'I think there are a lot of positive things to take from here. It's a good start. There was some good quality tennis, even though the result is not the one that I wanted. 'But I need to be realistic a little bit and keep working hard and try to sharpen my game. I need to be more consistent and I need to be able to take my opportunities when I have them. Overall I can be pretty happy but I'm such a perfectionist that I don't want to be satisfied.'","Venus Williams defeated Agnieszka Radwanska 6-3 2-6 6-1 in Melbourne .

"The Prince of Wales, comedian Russell Brand and vlogger-turned-author Zoella all feature on a list of the 500 most influential people in Britain today. The annual Debrett's 500 list covers 24 categories across society including politics, advertising, architecture, food, sport, education and journalism. Established personalities such as Tony Blair and Richard Branson are joined by new faces such as Oscar hopeful Eddie Redmayne. Scroll down for video . Russell Brand's book Revolution has put him squarely in the influential literature list with Hilary Mantel . Other new entries include actor Idris Elba, Formula One world champion Lewis Hamilton, television presenter Clare Balding, musicians Ed Sheeran and Sam Smith, and digital sensation Jamal Edwards. Russell Brand joins fellow authors Hilary Mantel, Ian McEwan and Kate Mosse on the influential literature list, after publication of his anti-government treatise Revolution. The guide writes: 'Those who deplore the histrionic celebrity’s woolly-minded populism and woeful grasp of economics are deceiving themselves if they think he lacks influence.' It adds, 'Whether he is considered a revolutionary or just an irritation, Brand’s influence over the masses is a force that cannot be denied.' YouTube vlogger and author Zoe Sugg - better known as her online alter ego Zoella, is named in the 'New Media' list along with her boyfriend, fellow YouTuber Alfie Deyes and prolific tweeter, Stephen Fry.

The guide, which describes the Prince of Wales as a 'pioneer for sustainable development' explains: 'Perhaps seen by some as a controversial influence over the realm of architecture, Prince Charles is an undoubted influence none the less. Victoria Beckham, the Duchess of Cambridge and Cara Delevingne all make it on to the most influential fashion list along with Kate Moss and David Gandy. Debrett's outlines Kate Middleton's power: 'Her commitment to British brands sees sales of household labels soar – what she wears one day sells out the next. 'Whether playing volleyball in wedges or hockey in heels, fashion’s favourite royal combines understated, conservative charm with youthful elegance as an ambassador of British style.' In art Banksy, Tracey Emin, Grayson Perry and Damien Hirst are included on the list.

It's a fascinating mix of people, and not entirely who you might expect. 'Every individual, though, demonstrates outstanding qualities of influence, achievement and inspiration. 'I think now is the perfect time to consider how we can inspire the next generation of influencers, so that we can ensure that everyone, regardless of their background, has an equal opportunity to succeed.' Seen as a guide for the upper classes, Debrett's has launched a foundation which aims to support social mobility in a bid to ensure that the next generation of leaders and influencers are from all backgrounds.","Comedian and Revolution author Russell 'is a force that cannot be denied'

"New Silverstone chief Patrick Allen is to kickstart his bid to make the British Grand Prix more affordable with immediate effect. Allen was appointed to his role earlier this month after the British Racing Drivers' Club decided a change of management behind the scenes was required to push the Northamptonshire circuit forward. Allen quickly stated the cheapest race-day ticket for this season's event on July 5, priced at £155 for general admission, was far too expensive. New Silverstone chief Patrick Allen is set to charge lower prices for this year's British Grand Prix . Lewis Hamilton won last year's event - where the cheapest race-day ticket was priced at £155 . Allen declared his intention to make tickets for next year's race as low as £99, but has been so overwhelmed by positive feedback, he has decided to take the innovative step now. From 9am Wednesday 1,000 general-admission tickets priced at £99 are to go on sale on a first-come first-served basis, the first time since 2008 tickets have been available for the race at that price. Allen has also decided children aged 10 and under can attend the whole weekend free of charge on a general-admission ticket, whilst children aged 11-15 can attend race day for only £49. Hamilton (racing last year for Mercedes) won 11 races on his way to the 2014 Drivers' World Championship . Allen said: 'We need to start appealing to a broader audience, and an element of this is obviously about getting the product right, but we also have to offer good value for money. 'The last time Silverstone sold grand prix tickets for £99 was the same year Lewis Hamilton won his first F1 world championship. 'So in order to celebrate his second title we are releasing a limited number of 2015 tickets at 2008 prices.'","£155 was cheapest general admission ticket at the 2014 British Grand Prix .
