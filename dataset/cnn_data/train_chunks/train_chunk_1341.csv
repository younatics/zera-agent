"Google and Microsoft are among the businesses attempting to stop Marriott hotels from blocking guest’s personal internet devices in attempt to avoid expensive charges. Hotel guests wishing to avoid expensive Wi-Fi costs have been powering their internet with their smartphones to the chagrin of some establishments. Marriott (MAR) and the hotel lobby American Hospitality & Lodging Association petitioned the FCC this summer to allow hotels to prevent people from turning their phones into Wi-Fi hotspots. Blocking Wi-Fi: Marriott (MAR) and the hotel lobby American Hospitality & Lodging Association petitioned the FCC this summer to allow hotels to prevent people from turning their phones into Wi-Fi hotspots . Marriot and the hotel lobby said that guests could also use their phones to attack the hotel's Wi-Fi network and to threaten the privacy of other guests. The large chain hotel complained that guest's devices slowed down the internet speed for other customers and interfered with the hotel Wi-Fi system. CNN says Marriot received roughly 21 responses to their requests most of which said that the hotel simply wants to overcharge guests for internet. 'If a customer arrives at a hotel with her own Mi-Fi device and the hotel interferes with the customer's connection to that personal hotspot, the hotel can effectively force the customer to purchase the hotel's Wi-Fi services to gain access, even though the customer has already paid her mobile operator for personal hotspot capability, ‘said Microsoft (MSFT, Tech30) in a filing to the FCC opposing Marriott's request. Google agreed with Microsoft that blocking internet hotspots 'would undermine the public interest.' Business Insider reports that Hotels have been caught using Wi-Fi blockers in the past and had to pay the fine. In October after the FCC found out that The Marriot Hotel group blocked Wi-Fi networks during an event at a hotel in Nashville, they were fined $600,000. The FCC said that consumers who have bought data plans from their own service providers should be able to use them instead of paying the hotel up to $1,000 per device to use its own Wi-Fi facilities.

"A Los Angeles judge has declined a bid from attorneys for Roman Polanski to close the 1977 child sex case against the Oscar-winning director, a court spokeswoman said on Wednesday. The decision by Los Angeles Superior Court Judge James Brandlin on Tuesday is the latest defeat for the filmmaker in having the case dismissed without returning to the United States. Polanski's attorneys had filed court papers last week seeking an evidentiary hearing on what they called prosecutorial and judicial misconduct in the case in a bid to have it dismissed, at least in part to allow Academy Award-winning director of 'The Pianist' to travel freely without the threat of extradition. Warrant for arrest: Roman Polanski, pictured this October, was denied a bid from attorneys the 1977 child sex case against a 13-year-old girl . 'While this court is empowered to order an evidentiary hearing, it may also exercise its discretion by declining to do so,' Brandlin wrote in a nine-page ruling. The judge added that Polanski 'forfeited his right to avail himself of the authority of this court under the fugitive disentitlement doctrine' but could return to California to obtain an evidentiary hearing. The director's lawyers have fought for years to have the case thrown out on claims that Polanski was a victim of judicial and prosecutorial misconduct. Courts have ruled they cannot address the issues unless he returns to California. Polanski, 81, was charged in 1977 with raping a 13-year-old girl in Los Angeles after plying her with champagne and drugs. He pleaded guilty to having unlawful sex with a minor. But the director of such films as 'Rosemary's Baby' and 'Chinatown' fled to France before sentencing, fearing the judge would impose more prison time than the 42 days he had spent behind bars for a psychiatric evaluation. Lawyers for the French-born director argued that he has served his sentence and that he need not be present in court for the case to close officially. There is a warrant for Polanski's arrest in the United States. A representative for the Los Angeles District Attorney's Office declined to comment, as did Polanski's agent, and the filmmaker's attorney did not return a call or email. Polanski was questioned by Polish prosecutors in October after U.S. authorities requested his extradition. The director, who spent much of his young life in Poland, has said he plans to shoot a film in Poland about Alfred Dreyfus, a Jewish French military officer falsely convicted of treason. The girl:  In a 1977 plea deal, the Oscar-winning director pleaded guilty to one count of statutory rape for having sex with this 13-year-old girl during a photo shoot in Los Angeles .

"Having the top scorer in the league is normally a good indicator who will win promotion at the end of the season. And in Daryl Murphy Ipswich have the Championship’s most lethal marksman and his double at Griffin Park took his tally to 16 this season and cemented Mick McCarthy’s side in the automatic promotion places. Murphy’s goals, coupled with this impressive win over a high-flying Brentford side, shows why Ipswich should be taken seriously as promotion candidates. Daryl Murphy rounds David Button to score Ipswich's second goal, his 17th of the season . Brentford: Button 5, Odubajo 5.5, Dean 6, Craig 4.5, Bidwell 6, Diagouraga 5, Douglas 5.5 (Toral 65 6), Jota 6, Pritchard 6, Judge 6 (Saunders 7 75), Gray 5 (Proschwitz 65 5) Subs not used: Bonham, Tarkowski, Dallas, Smith . Goals: Saunders 80, 90 . Ipswich: Bialkowski 6, Chambers 6.5, Smith 7, Berra 7, Parr 7, Skuse 7, Tabb 7 (S.Hunt 72 6), Bishop 7 (Bru 72 6), Anderson 7.5 (N.Hunt 65 6), Murphy 8.5, McGoldrick 7.5 . Subs not used: Gerken, Clarke, Ambrose, Sammon . Goals: Murphy 1, 21, Anderson 30, Smith 82 . Referee: Fred Graham 6 . Attendance: 12,165 . But with the transfer window opening next week, McCarthy says is not worried about anyone trying to prise his top scorer away from Portman Road . McCarthy said: ‘At the moment we are in the top two of the league and he is top scorer. If someone comes in and offers bonkers money then it will upset the apple cart and I will have to deal with it. ‘We turned down £7.5millon for David McGoldrick and £3.5m for Tyrone Mings in the past. The owner Marcus (Evans) has a chunk of dough, and that is the support he gives me meaning I don’t have to sell my best players, and why would I when we are towards the top of the league?’ It was Murphy who got Ipswich off the perfect start with the opening goal after just 19 seconds. Brentford keeper David Button’s clearance only managed to find Teddy Bishop who headed the ball out to Paul Anderson on the right and he crossed for Murphy who found space in the middle of the penalty area and fired into the bottom corner. Murphy is congratulated by his team-mates after sending his side top of the Championship . And Ipswich - who have now lost just once in the last 19 games - doubled their lead through Murphy on 21 minutes. The Republic of Ireland striker latched onto a long ball from Jonathan Parr and shrugged off the challenge of Tony Craig before rounding Button and slotting the ball into an empty net. It was three on the half hour when Murphy played the ball out to Jay Tabb who crossed for Paul Anderson who was able to bundle the ball over the line from close range. Ipswich manager Mick McCarthy can afford a smile as his team showed they are real promotion candidates . Brentford have been one of the surprise packages in the Championship this season, but they were caught cold by Ipswich’s clinical finishing. But the home side did not give up and did get on the scoresheet with 10 minutes remaining when substitute Sam Saunders’ deflected shot looped over Bartosz Bialkowski and into the far corner. But Ipswich centre back Tommy Smith replied straight away when he bent the ball into the top corner from 10 yards. The late flurry of goals was completed when Saunders bundled the ball over the line for a second for Brentford but it was too late to stop the points heading back to East Anglia. McCarthy added: ‘The league is so tough and we have to be ruthless and relentless as the league is. ‘Bournemouth are the best team in the league in my view. But there are plenty of other sides in contention, but results don’t lie, we have the points and we have to keep that going.’ For Brentford it was only their third home defeat this calendar year and boss Mark Warburton rued his side’s defending. He said: ‘You can’t go three down to teams of that quality and give yourself a mountain to climb. ‘We weren’t muscled out of it but we were uncharacteristically sloppy. We were a little bit tentative and maybe that first minute goal unnerved a couple of our players.’","Daryl Murphy fires visitors ahead after just 19 seconds .

"Despite its very limited release,The Interview is making plenty of money at the box office. Opening in just 331 theaters, the Kim Jong-un assassination film was able to bring in $1million on Thursday alone.

'The audience reaction was fantastic - the limited release, in under 10% of the amount of theaters originally planned, featured numerous sell-outs and a first-day gross over $1 million.'

"A 21-year-old schoolteacher has gone from Amish to stylish thanks to a dramatic makeover courtesy of a women's magazine. Theodore Leaf, a celebrity stylist and Glamour Magazine’s beauty editor-at-large, has traveled to the tiny Amish enclave of Jamesport, Pennsylvania, to glam up a young woman named Sarah by giving her a brand new hairdo. The 21-year-old teacher and housekeeper grew up in a small Amish community and has never colored or styled her hair, leaving her locks looking drab and permanently tucked underneath a small white bonnet for modesty. Scroll down for video . Breaking Amish: Sarah, a 21-year-old Amish schoolteacher and housekeeper, pictured here before her dramatic hair makeover (left) and after (right) on an episode of Glamour Magazine's Bad Hair Day . 'I’m definitely up for adventure... and doing my hair is definitely exciting,' Sarah says before her transformation gets under way. In the video of Sarah's dramatic makeover released by Glamour Magazine on YouTube earlier this month as part of its series Bad Hair Day, Sarah explains to the stylist that most of the time she wears her tresses hidden from view, as dictated by her faith. The only exception was when she did her rumpsringa - a rite of passage for Amish teenagers during which they are allowed to temporarily leave their community and experience the outside culture. Bee in her bonnet: Sarah explains that her never has never been colored, and she usually wears it pinned up and tucked underneath a small bonnet for modesty . Extreme makeover: Amish Edition: Celebrity stylist Theodore Leaf decided to turn Sarah blonde . Cutting edge look: To give her lackluster tresses some movement and texture, Leaf gave Sarah a layered look . Amish blow dryer: Sarah lamented that she cannot blow-dry her hair because there is not electricity in her home . Theodore Leaf, who also hosts a style show on LOGO-TV, tells Sarah he plans to color her hair - 'because blondes have more fun' - and add layers to give movement to her long-neglected locks. While getting her hair dyed, Sarah confides in Leaf that not having electricity in her home is a major challenge because she is unable to use a blow-dryer. Leaf advises Sarah to use foam to add wave and braid her hair before bedtime for texture. ‘Do you think there is a way to have an Amish blow dryer?' Sarah inquires. In response, Leaf jokingly blows on her newly highlighted tresses while combing them out. 'I'll be done next year,' he quips. Big reveal: Both Sarah and her Amish friend Laura (right) were left speechless by the schoolteacher's dramatic transformation . All smiles: Sarah appeared to be very pleased with her beachy blonde, wavy tresses and ruby red lips . She's impressed: Laura pronounced her friend's new, flirty look to be 'hot' The video of Sarah's makeover concludes with the big reveal when the new and improved Amish schoolmarm unveils her new look to her friend and co-worker, Laura, a fellow member of the Amish community. When Sarah looks at herself in the mirror for the first time since the transformation, she appears stunned and overjoyed, exclaiming in delight: 'Oh, my stars!' Gone is the bonnet and Sarah's flat, mousy wisps of hair. Instead, the 21-year-old is now sporting a mane of beachy blonde, layered hair, with ruby red lips and a light touch of makeup completing the picture. 'This look right here is hot!' concludes her Amish pal in admiration.","Celebrity stylist Theodore Leaf traveled to tiny Amish enclave of Jamesport, Pennsylvania, to glam up Amish woman named Sarah .

"Silviniaco Conti handed trainer Paul Nicholls a remarkable ninth win in the King George VI Chase at Kempton as he dismantled the opposition with a display of clinical and ruthless steeplechasing. The 15-8 favourite’s former stablemate Kauto Star, a five-time winner of this race and honoured with the unveiling of a statue before racing, produced some brilliant Boxing Day displays. This was a performance of utter control by Silviniaco Conti which would have been worthy of Kauto Star. Noel Fehily celebrates his victory on Silviniaco Conti in the  King George VI Chase . Trainer Paul Nicholls celebrates his victory with Silviniaco Conti in the  King George VI Chase . Silviniaco Conti secured victory in the King George XI Chase at Kempton on Boxing Day . Noel Fehily’s mount jumped with fluency and galloped relentlessly as he drew four-and-a-half lengths clear of Dynaste and a further five from stablemate Al Ferof to win the race for a second year running. That duo, along with Champagne Fever (fourth), Cue Card (fifth) and Johns Spirit (sixth), were all queuing up on Conti’s tail as the field turned into the home straight. But they had nothing left to give. The dual Betfair Chase winner had drawn the sting out of them all, like a boxer who pummels his opponent with a repetitive jab on the chin. The performance made a mockery of the promoter’s not unreasonable efforts to build up this £200,000 contest watched by a crowd of almost 22,000 as one of the most open King George’s ever run. The victory also enabled the eight-year-old to join an illustrious list of horses to have won back-to-back King George’s, including Pendil, Captain Christy, Silver Buck, The Fellow, Kicking King and Wayward Lad. Silviniaco Conti followed up last year’s win with a fourth place in the Cheltenham Gold Cup and Nicholls’ aim is now to win that race — a feat he feels would truly place the gelding’s name up with the chasing glitterati. Trainer Paul Nicholls horse raced to a second consecutive victory at the race . Silviniaco Conti ridden by Noel Fehily on their way to victory in the William Hill King George VI Chase . He also has confidence he can achieve the feat having identified, and cured, the attack of chronic gastric ulcers which he feels were hampering Silviniaco Conti, jointly owned by Chris Giles and Jared Sullivan, last season. Nicholls, who up until the King George had endured a frustrating day with Saphir Du Rheu falling in the Kauto Star Novices’ Chase and Irving pulling up in the Christmas Hurdle, said: ‘I think this was a career-best effort. I think he is a better horse than he was a year ago. He is a bit stronger. ‘The Cheltenham Gold Cup is now our No 1 target with him. I know why he didn’t perform last year — a few little things that we have put right. We found out he was suffering from gastric ulcers and the cheek-pieces have helped him concentrate a bit more. ‘If we can get him therein this form we have a big chance.’ Fehily added: ‘I think he’s proved what a very good horse he is, whatever the ground. He did it the hard way, he went a real good gallop and picked it up from the bend. He’s just a hell of a good horse.’ On his own record, Nicholls added: ‘I’ll have to go for 10 and make it a round number. I am astounded — it is incredible. It shows we have a good team at home. We are good with these staying chasers. Our set-up suits well. Hopefully, Conti will come back next year.’ King George sponsors William Hill make Silviniaco Conti 7-2 favourite for the Gold Cup, having halved his odds. The next two in the betting, Bobs Worth (10-1) and reigning champion Lord Windermere (12-1), run in tomorrow’s Lexus Chase at Leopardstown. Conti is 5-1 to win the King George for a third time next year. The two-mile Champion Chase seems the more likely target for Al Ferof after he finished third for a second year running under Sam Twiston-Davies. Nicholls added: ‘I would love to run Al Ferof in the Champion Chase. I think he has all the speed in the world. It amazed me he stayed on to be third because he looked beat turning in. His class gets him there.’ And it seems likely Dynaste will try to win a second Ryanair Chase over two miles and five furlongs rather than go for the three and a quarter mile Gold Cup. Trainer David Pipe said: ‘He’s run his heart out. I’m sure he’ll have entries in both races at Cheltenham (Ryanair and Gold Cup), but I’d rather win a Ryanair than be placed in a Gold Cup.’ One wonders if the Ryanair will also be the target of Champagne Fever after his stamina also looked to be running on empty in the final furlong.","Trainer Paul Nicholls lands ninth King George VI Chase victory .

"Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain is already developing into a genuine star at Arsenal, and the England midfielder is now looking to legends of the game to improve his play. Oxlade-Chamberlain, the only Gunners player to feature in all of the club's 25 games this season, has been a shining light in a disappointing start for Arsene Wenger's side. And the 21-year-old attributes his improvement to the experience of watching some of the great players, including club legend Thierry Henry. Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain has played all of Arsenal's 25 first-team fixtures this season, largely in midfield . The 21-year-old is beginning to adapt his game to a central role, learning from legends in the process . Thierry Henry returned to Arsenal in 2012 when Oxlade-Chamberlain had just joined from Southampton . Arsenal's record goalscorer played alongside Oxlade-Chamberlain during his return to the club in 2012, and the Englishman believes he learned a lot about the game from working with the World Cup winner. Henry gave the young man 'endless amounts of advice', but it was by watching him train the Oxlade-Chamberlain picked up the most. 'You know when you see typical Henry, coming in from the left and you think ""He is just going to open up here and curl it in the bottom corner and score like he always does"",' he told The Telegraph. The 21-year-old says training with Henry taught him a lot as a young player looking to improve his game . Oxlade-Chamberlain celebrates with Olivier Giroud and Danny Welbeck after Arsenal score at Anfield . 'What I remember is when he missed one of those chances in training. I've never seen anyone be so angry with himself and disappointed. 'The first thing he would says was ""Titi, come on!"" It was just to himself out loud. It made you realise why he used to score them constantly.' With Henry having retired, and set for a possible coaching role at Arsenal, Oxlade-Chamberlain has been watching other stars of European football to improve his game. As the England international moves inside into a central midfield role he has been studying the likes of Andres Iniesta, Steven Gerrard and Blaise Matuidi, but it is Holland legend Wesley Sneijder who seems to have particularly caught his eye. Wesley Sneijder is among the midfield stars of European football that Oxlade-Chamberlain has been watching . The Arsenal star described Sneijder as 'one of the best', and says he would love to have a similar career . 'I think he is one of the world's best,' said Oxlade-Chabmerlain. 'He doesn't play as deep but he finds really good pockets in midfield, he turns and, whether he is going to shoot, pass or run with the ball, he causes problems. 'I would love to get to there, to have the career that he has had. Players like that you watch.'","Arsenal star trained alongside Thierry Henry for short spell in 2012 .

"It is like running into a brick wall, right now, playing this Chelsea team. A beautifully constructed brick wall, obviously. Not one slung up by a couple of navvies looking to take an early cut over Christmas. This is a wall of great precision and craftsmanship, of sound foundations and excellent structure. West Ham came here in good form, with half an eye on an upset, and bounced straight off Chelsea. They hit a post through Morgan Amalfitano in the 87th minute, but barely threatened before that. Leaders Chelsea recorded their third straight 2-0 Premier League victory on Boxing Day against London rivals West Ham . Chelsea were in complete control from start to finish as they eased past West Ham at Stamford Bridge . Diego Costa feels right at home at Stamford Bridge. The Spaniard has scored nine goals and had one assist in his eight home league games this season. Not starting two of your best players does not help — but it is hard to imagine even Alex Song and Diafra Sakho would have made an enormous difference, so tight is this Chelsea unit. West Ham manager Sam Allardyce elected to introduce them in the 59th minute and in the 62nd Chelsea scored their second. They could have had many, many more. Chelsea had 28 shots, of which nine were on target and Adrian, West Ham’s goalkeeper, was arguably the man of the match. Jose Mourinho is getting huge performances out of his players and even the goals were events, of a sort. John Terry scored in consecutive games for the first time since August 2006 — against Greece for England and Manchester City for Chelsea — while Diego Costa marked a return to form with an absolute peach to confirm victory in the second half. John Terry gave his side the lead in the first half at Stamford Bridge when he converted from close range on the half hour mark . The Chelsea captain prodded home from two yards out after a corner was flicked on into his direction at the near post . Terry turns away to celebrate his second goal in as many games after setting Chelsea on their way to a win at Stoke on Monday . Terry celebrates his goal in the 31st minute at Stamford Bridge with Spanish duo Diego Costa and Cesc Fabregas . Chelsea: Courtois 6.5, Ivanovic 7, Cahill 7, Terry 7.5, Azpilicueta 7, Fabregas 7, Matic 7.5, Willian 6.5 (Ramires 86), Oscar 6.5 (Mikel 83), Hazard 6.5, Costa 7 (Drogba 83).

Subs not used: Jarvis, O'Brien, Jaaskelainen, Cole. Booked: Collins, Cresswell, Reid. Referee: Michael Oliver (Northumberland). Attendance: 41,589. Ratings by NEIL ASHTON at Stamford Bridge . Cesc Fabregas, whose heat map is displayed above, produced another dominant performance in central midfield for Chelsea - CLICK HERE FOR MATCH ZONE . Costa’s form has dipped of late and he had scored one goal in his last six appearances going into this match. As strikers feed off confidence, the sight of him taking three West Ham defenders out of the game in one swift goalscoring movement will not make comfortable viewing at Southampton, where Chelsea are due next. Yet this was not just about the matchwinners. The usual suspects in the supporting cast — Nemanja Matic, Cesc Fabregas, Eden Hazard — maintained their extremely high standards, while Willian was tireless, perhaps the hardest worker on the field. Last to play at the weekend, first out this Boxing Day, Chelsea showed no signs of festive fatigue. Mourinho said he does not have a grand plan for this holiday season, and takes each game on merit. Maybe this optimism will catch up with his players come January 1 at White Hart Lane, but this was another display that had the mark of champions. Allardyce needs to beat Arsenal on Sunday for his own strategy to be deemed successful. Leaving out Song and Sakho weakened West Ham and the first half confirmed that. For a team in fourth place who had outplayed Manchester City in October, they were never in contention and lucky not to be out of the game at half-time. Branislav Ivanovic was involved in a flashpoint towards the end of the first half after taking a tumble in the West Ham penalty area . The Serbian defender went down in the penalty area in first-half injury time and that sparked a furious reaction from West Ham's players . Chelsea defender Ivanovic goes to ground after a challenge from West Ham striker Andy Carroll . The goals came a distance apart, after 31 and 62 minutes, illustrating Chelsea’s control, but it was the sheer weight of opportunity that should impress. Allardyce prides himself on constructing robust defensive units, but a conservative estimate suggests Chelsea had 15 chances that could have produced goals, including long-range free-kicks and a series of stunning saves by Adrian. David de Gea is not the only Spanish goalkeeper in top form in the Premier League right now. Cesc Fabregas made 103 passes against West Ham on Saturday, almost double any other player on the pitch. This was the eighth most in Premier League history. So, yes, Chelsea should have had more, but that is the only quibble. It was certainly not for want of trying. One day they will catch a team when it all goes right and will run up a rugby score. As it was, two were enough. Terry must really like this time of year. His last three Premier League goals for Chelsea have all come in December — spread across more than a year — although there were just four days between his last two. On both occasions, they were the all-important deadlock breakers, and particularly vital on Friday after so many misses. How he must have enjoyed scoring it in front of those mocking him in the away enclosure, too. West Ham players felt Ivanovic tried to trick referee Michael Oliver into awarding Chelsea a penalty while the Serbian thought he was caught . Carroll and Ivanovic exchange words as a number of players from both sides join in the debate . West Ham's Adrian, Aaron Cresswell and Kevin Nolan join Chelsea striker Costa in trying to separate the arguing pair . West Ham players help Ivanovic to his feet after they felt he dived in an attempt to win a penalty . Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho (left) and West Ham boss Sam Allardyce (right) issue instructions to their teams . It was a typical Chelsea move — brains and brawn. An intricate build-up climaxed with Hazard surging into the area and winning a corner from a frenzied scramble. Fabregas curled it in, Costa flicked it on and Terry popped up, two yards from goal, to tap the ball past Adrian — powerless, for once. The second came shortly after Allardyce had made his big changes, rather negating their impact. Cheikhou Kouyate lost the ball in midfield, Hazard pounced, played it through to Costa and he took a trio of West Ham defenders out of the equation before finishing with a shot low across his body. He has been missing a few of late, and he did here as well, but that was a goal of the highest quality, in tune with Chelsea’s performance. The last time West Ham came to Stamford Bridge, the match finished goalless and Mourinho accused Allardyce of taking football back two centuries. He says he regrets such harshness now but, despite West Ham’s lofty position, the present was still an awkward place to be for Allardyce’s men. They spent most of it chasing Chelsea, often with limited success. Sharper finishing and a lesser display from Adrian could have ended in a horrid humiliation, and the opportunities are truly too numerous to record in detail. Let’s just say there were chances for Oscar (fourth minute), Gary Cahill (10), Oscar (16), Cahill (21), Oscar (27), Willian (29), Matic (34), Costa (39), Costa (42), Hazard (52), Willian (55), Costa (65), Oscar (67), Matic (68), Fabregas (69), Oscar (71, twice) and Hazard (81).

Chelsea supporters, including one dressed like Santa, watch the Boxing Day action at Stamford Bridge . Former Arsenal team-mates Cesc Fabregas and Alex Song embrace after the final whistle at Stamford Bridge . Of those, at least six were kept out by the magnificent Adrian. He charged down a close-range shot from Cahill, a low effort after a forward run from Willian, tipped round from Matic 20 yards out, frustrated Hazard cutting inside, flicked over an Oscar free-kick and cleared off the line after Matic tried to replicate Terry’s opener. West Ham had the odd attempt, but their only scoring chance came with three minutes remaining. Mourinho is rare among managers in stating he loves the festive fixture pile-up, and lists it as one of the elements of the English game he most missed while abroad. One can see why. There was no question of him resting players, even after the battering Hazard received at Stoke, and no sign of fatigue as Chelsea left the pitch. Frank Lampard, recalling his time under Mourinho, said there were occasions when the players felt so confident, they could have gone out again a few hours after the final whistle. This looked like one of those days. The brick wall stood unmoved at the end, as West Ham wondered what had hit them.","Chelsea secure their third straight Premier League victory on Boxing Day at Stamford Bridge .

"The international search for a 19-year-old Oklahoma City student who vanished while vacationing Ecuador nearly a year ago has been reignited after authorities reported two possible sightings of the teen. August Reiger, who graduated in May 2013 as a valedictorian from Classen School of Advanced Studies, disappeared from the resort town of Banos last June, with fears he was kidnapped. His father, Chris Reiger, has now confirmed there have been at least two possible sightings reported in the past week, but that there is no way to be sure whether the person seen was his son. 'We certainly haven’t given up hope that he’s going to be found, no doubt about that,' Chris Reiger told News OK. 'We still think he will be.' Still missing: August Reiger, 19, has been sighted twice in the past week, according to Ecuadorian authorities, after going missing June 16 in Banos . Alternative looks: Reiger's family and friends posted photos on the Facebook page 'Find August Reiger' showing how the teen might look with closely cropped hair (left) and with a shorter haircut (right) Reigerwas on a trek in the Banos mountains on June 16 when he walked ahead of the group and vanished. More than 150 police officers and volunteers have searched the area - . a popular tourist spot not reportedly known for kidnappings or disappearance - as well as friends and family. President Barack Obama officially declared Reiger a 'missing patriot', and the Ecuadoran government is offering a reward for Reiger's safe return. ‘Obviously he’s gone and we can’t find out where he is,’ cousin Laura Laporte told the television station NewsChannel4. ‘It’s very nice to hear that the U.S. government is giving us attention and getting involved.’ Warnings were issued in provinces spanning the entire country after local police announced that a credible source reported seeing the 18-year-old in the back of a vehicle headed towards the Amazon region. 'It's a little scary to know that August could be in the hands of somebody that's a dangerous person or persons,' Reiger's aunt, Cristi Reiger, told the station KOCO. 'On the other hand, the family is elated because we know he's alive.' Reiger’s loved ones say the possibility that the graduate had disappeared of his own accord is out of the question. 'He’s sweet,' Laporte said. 'People love him. He has big plans.' Laporte and the rest of the family fear that the well-traveled 18-year-old has been kidnapped. 'If that’s the case, we want to plead for mercy,' she said. 'We want to plead to the people who may have him keep him safe and bring him home.' The teen's relatives and friends are urging people to put pressure on their local congressional representatives to reach out to the American Embassy in the Ecuadorian capital of Quito. Authorities in Ecuador were initially treating the disappearance of valedictorian August Reiger, 18, as a kidnapping . 'Bright future': Oklahoma's August Reiger, 18, graduated as a valedictorian from Classen School of Advanced Studies just one month before going missing . August Reiger walked ahead of his family during a trek in Banos, Ecuador, when he vanished .

The social media page includes altered photos of the missing 18-year-old showing how Reiger might look with closely cropped hair and with a shorter haircut. Reiger's father said his son was 'only a few minutes ahead of us in the trail' and he hoped to see him at a popular landmark. He believes his son could have fallen off a steep ledge of the mountain, in an area he described as an Ecuadorean version of Aspen, Colorado. 'We assumed that he'd be sitting there waiting for us,' he told News9. 'In fact, the second son had gotten there before . us, and he was sitting there waiting...but he hadn't seen his brother.' Reiger was not carrying any money at the time. 'Everybody . is both shocked and baffled, because they say nothing like this has . happened in this town,' Mr Reiger said last week. He told The Oklahoman that the . entire trail is visible from his hotel, so it's unlikely his son - fluent in Spanish - got . lost. He also added that no one has asked for a ransom. Popular tourist spot Banos, in Ecuador, is not known for kidnappings or disappearances . The Reiger family traveled to Banos, Ecuador, because August spoke Spanish fluently and loved anthropology . The U.S. Embassy says it is in close contact with the Reiger family while investigators in Ecuador search for the missing man, according to News9. Reiger loves anthropology and was offered a University of Oklahoma Fulbright scholarship. He is a National Merit Scholar, an Oklahoma Academic Scholar and a member of the National Honor Society. His mom, Randa Reiger, is an art teacher at Heronville Elementary. Candace Lockett, the mother of Reiger's girlfriend Kaylee Sue Lockett, said she didn't believe Reiger ran away.

"A stunning late, long-range strike by Johann Gudmundsson earned 10-man Charlton a 1-1 draw against Cardiff in a pulsating clash at The Valley. Tom Adeyemi gave the visitors an early lead before Callum Harriott was shown a red card for a high tackle on Craig Noone. Charlton felt the visitors should also have been reduced for 10 men, but Sean Morrison was shown just a yellow after he pulled down George Tucudean when through on goal. However Charlton kept fighting and Gudmundsson levelled two minutes before full-time. Johann Gudmundsson celebrates in front of the Charlton fans after scoring a late equaliser . It was a slow start from Charlton as Cardiff snapped into the early tackles and denied them any time on the ball. The pressure soon told and home goalkeeper Neil Etheridge had to act swiftly to gather a Peter Whittingham corner just as Kenwyne Jones was about to pounce. The opening goal arrived on 11 minutes. Aron Gunnarsson launched a long throw into the box and Sean Morrison rose well and flicked on at the near post before Adeyemi placed his header expertly beyond Etheridge. Just two minutes later and the same tactic almost worked again. Gunnarsson's throw into the danger zone was half-cleared and Adeyemi fizzed a right-footed half-volley narrowly over from 20-yards. The Addicks pressed forward but rarely troubled David Marshall in the Cardiff goal. Harriott, Charlton's pacey winger, had some joy down the right against Declan John but when he wriggled free and powered towards the box his cross was well intercepted by Ben Turner. Callum Harriott protests his innocence after being shown a red card for his tackle on Craig Noone . Charlton: Etheridge, Solly, Ben Haim, Bikey, Gomez, Gudmundsson, Buyens, Jackson, Harriott, Cousins, Tucudean. Subs: Wilson, Bulot, Vetokele, Onyewu, Fox, Pope, Ahearne-Grant. Cardiff: Marshall, Brayford, Sean Morrison, Turner, John, Gunnarsson, Adeyemi, Whittingham, Noone, Le Fondre, Jones. Subs: Da Silva, Connolly, Ralls, Moore, Harris, Ecuele Manga, Macheda. Referee: Mick Russell (Hertfordshire) It was Harriott's final contribution. On 32 minutes his ill-timed tackle on Noone was late and high. Noone crumpled to the floor in agony and referee Mick Russell quickly flashed his red card. Charlton responded well and created their best chance of the game on 38 minutes. Yoni Buyens played a clever ball into the box and Charlton's Romanian striker George Tucudean fired in a powerful near post volley that Marshall was forced to beat away for a corner. The hosts created the first opening of the second half on 52 minutes. Buyens picked-out Gudmundsson in the box who turned well but shot straight at Marshall. Charlton, playing with 10-men, continued to press. The impressive Gudmundsson whipped in a corner and Tucudean's near post flick rattled the outside of Marshall's post. Peter Whittingham holds off Charlton's Jordan Cousins during a strong first half for Cardiff . Then came the controversy. On 63 minutes Morrison, the Cardiff defender, hauled down Tucudean who was through on goal. This crowd chanted for a red but the referee issued a relieved looking Morrison a yellow. To add to the agony, Gudmundsson cracked the post from the resultant free kick. Marshall then denied Gudmundsson with a fine save on 70 minutes before Morrison cleared off the line after Tucudean's close-range flick from Jordan Cousin's shot had beaten Marshall. However Charlton gave it one last push and with two minutes left were rewarded. Gudmundsson picked up the ball 30-yards out and for once Cardiff's defence failed to get tight. The Icelander took aim and lashed home a superb left-footed effort into the top corner. And it could have been even worse for Cardiff had Igor Vetokele not skied an effort way over the bar when he was clean through on goal with the very last kick of the game.

Israel claimed it was targeting Iranian weapons bound for Hezbollah in Lebanon. But Syrian officials accused Israel of carrying out 'terrorist acts' on behalf of jihadi groups trying to overthrow President Bashar al-Assad. Israel's second raid on Syria in 48 hours signalled a massive escalation of its involvement in the two-year civil war. Video footage showed dramatic orange-flamed blasts over Damascus's skyline after weapons dumps were hit in the raids, which also killed several people.

The Syrian regime was yesterday accused of massacring Sunni families in a campaign of 'sectarian cleansing'. Horrific images emerged of more than 100 bodies found in the town of Banias and nearby village of Bayda, which are in the heartlands of President Bashar al-Assad's rival Shia sect. A baby and a young girl were piled among a dozen members of one family, while other pictures show the mutilated and burned bodies of Sunnis. The US State Department reported that pro-government forces destroyed Bayda with mortars then executed surviving families. Local opposition groups accused the government of launching a campaign of sectarian cleansing. The Syrian Observatory For Human Rights said about 4,000 Sunnis had fled Banias amid fears of further massacres. The Syrian government claimed that  it had fought 'terrorist groups' and restored security to the area. Uzi Rubin, a missile expert and . former Israeli defence ministry official, said: 'If fired from southern . Lebanon [the Conqueror missiles] can reach Tel Aviv.

"West Ham took a swipe at Jose Mourinho ahead of their Boxing Day clash with Chelsea, mocking the Chelsea bosses' comments from last season. After watching his side draw 0-0 at Stamford Bridgelast season, Mourinho described Sam Allardyce's playing style as '19th-century football'. And although the Chelsea manager has since apologised for the remark, the Hammers could not resist a jibe ahead of Friday's fixture. West Ham's 'team coach' with Sam Allardyce driving it, as imagined by the club's Twitter account . Jose Mourinho (right) accused Allardyce's team of playing '19th century football' when the two met in January . The official West Ham Twitter account posted a picture of an old-fashioned horse-drawn coach, with Allardyce holding the reigns. The image was captioned with the message 'The West Ham United team coach (and horse) has arrived at @chesleasfc for today's game #19thcenturyfootball' In the build-up to the game Mourinho admitted that he was unwise to use the 'silly' phrase about West Ham, who have played much better football this season. 'Last season they were in big trouble,' said Mourinho. 'When you are fighting against relegation, you have to do everything to get points. Allardyce and Mourinho shake hands after Chelsea's 0-0 draw with West Ham at the Bridge earlier this year . Read our exclusive interview with Allardyce ahead of West Ham's Boxing Day trip to Chelsea . 'Yes it was a turning point for them because it gave them the confidence they needed and after that they kept in the division. This team is different. 'You see the way they play every game, they are a better team, they have better players and I think also Big Sam is showing now he is not what people sometimes say - a defensive coach, only knows how to play defensively and direct with long balls. 'He is giving a completely different image about himself, which can make the game more difficult for us but at the same time more attractive for everyone. 'He has my respect. Last season I had a couple of words about the fact they started winning time after two minutes of the game, which I don't like.'

"These are the horrific images that hammer home the very real dangers of crystal meth. But they are not the familiar compare-and-contrast images of junkies who have lost their looks. Instead, they show the huge risks involved with making methamphetamine either at home or on the road. The photos, which include a car in flames and an exploded house, have been released as researchers warn of a crude new method of manufacturing meth that poses a risk even to those who stay away from the drug. In flames: A car lies on the side or a Tennessee road after an explosion occurred due to a passenger making 'shake-and-bake' methamphetamine. The crude new method of making meth is posing a risk even to those who never smoke the drug . Charred remains: The accident took place outside Clarksville. So-called shake-and-bake meth is produced by combining raw, unstable ingredients in a two-litre bottle . It is filling hospitals with thousands . of uninsured burn patients requiring millions of dollars in advanced . treatment - a burden so costly that it is contributing to the closure of . some burns units. So-called 'shake-and-bake' meth is produced by combining raw, unstable ingredients in a two-litre bottle. But if the person mixing the noxious . brew makes the slightest error, such as removing the cap too soon or . accidentally perforating the plastic, the concoction can explode, . searing flesh and causing permanent disfigurement, blindness or even . death. A survey of key hospitals in . America's most-active meth states showed that up to a third of patients . in some burns units were hurt while making meth, and most were . uninsured. The average treatment costs $6,000 per . day, but the average meth patient's hospital stay costs $130,000 - 60 . per cent more than other burns patients, according to a study by doctors . in Kalamazoo, Michigan. The influx of patients is . overwhelming hospitals and becoming a major factor in the closure of . some burns wards, according to the Associated Press report. Highly explosive: Firemen tackle a blaze from a shake-and-bake meth lab explosion in Union, Missouri, in 2010 . Tell-tale signs: Police found these shake-and-bake meth ingredients inside the house in Union . At least seven burns units across the . U.S. have shut down over the past six years, partly due to consolidation . but also because of the cost of treating uninsured patients, many of . whom are connected to methamphetamine. Burns experts agree that the annual . cost to taxpayers is well into the tens if not hundreds of millions of . dollars, although it is impossible to determine a more accurate number . because so many meth users lie about the cause of their burns. Larger meth labs have been bursting into flames for years, usually in basements, backyard sheds or other private spaces. But those were fires that people . could usually escape. Using the shake-and-bake method, drug-makers . typically hold the flammable concoction up close, causing burns from the . waist to the face. Jason Grellner of the Franklin County, Missouri, Sheriff's Department, said: 'You're holding a flame-thrower in your hands.' Also known as the 'one-pot' approach, . the method is popular because it uses less pseudoephedrine - a common . component in some cold and allergy pills. It also yields meth in minutes rather . than hours, and is cheaper and easier to conceal. Meth cooks can carry . all the ingredients in a ruck sack and mix them in a bathroom stall or . the seat of a car. The improvised system first emerged . several years ago, partly in response to attempts by many states to . limit or forbid over-the-counter access to pseudoephedrine. Since then, the shake-and-bake recipe has spread to become the method of choice. The interior of a home in Clarksville, Tennessee, damaged by a shake-and-bake meth lab explosion last month . A danger to neighbours: The damaged exterior of the same home . By 2010, about 80 per cent of labs . busted by the federal Drug Enforcement Administration were using . shake-and-bake recipes, said Pat Johnakin, a DEA agent specialising in . meth. So instead of a large lab that . supplies many users, there are now more people making meth for their . personal use. The consequences are showing up in emergency rooms and . burns wards. Dr Michael Smock, director of the . burns unit at Mercy Hospital St Louis, said: 'From what we see on the . medical side, that's the primary reason the numbers seem to be going up - . greater numbers of producers making smaller batches.' It is impossible to know precisely . how many people are burned while making shake-and-bake meth. Some avoid . medical treatment, and no one keeps exact track of those who go to the . hospital. But many burns centres in the most . active meth-producing states report sharp spikes in the number of . patients linked to meth. And experts say the trend goes well beyond . those facilities. In Indiana, about three-quarters of . meth busts now involve shake-and-bake. And injuries are rising sharply, . mostly because of burns, said Niki Crawford of the Indiana State Police . Meth Suppression Team. Highly addictive: Known as 'ice', methamphetamine crystals are smoked through a pipe . Indiana had 89 meth-related injuries . during the ten-year period ending in 2009. The state has had 70 in the . last 23 months, mostly from shake-and-bake labs, Ms Crawford said. What's more, meth-related burns often sear some of the body's most sensitive areas - the face and hands. Dr Lucy Wibbenmeyer, of the burns centre at the University of Iowa, said: . 'I don't think a lot of these patients will be able to re-enter . society. They'll need rehab therapy, occupational therapy, which is very . expensive.' Researchers at the University of Iowa . found that people burned while making meth typically have longer . hospital stays and more expensive bills than other burn patients - bills . that are frequently absorbed by the hospital since a vast majority of . the meth-makers lack insurance. Doctors at Bronson Methodist Hospital . in Kalamazoo, Michigan, performed a five-year study of meth patients in . the early 2000s, then a follow-up study in 2009-2010. Their investigation concurred with . the Iowa findings. The Kalamazoo study also found that meth burn victims . were more likely to suffer damage to the lungs and windpipe, spent more . time on ventilators and needed surgery more often. That report also found that only about . 10 per cent of meth patients had private insurance coverage, compared . with 59 percent of other patients. And in many cases, their injuries . leave them unable to work.","Crude manufacturing method is filling hospitals with uninsured burns victims .

"Hundreds of bankers across three continents are embroiled in the interest-rate fixing scandal that has left Barclays chief executive Bob Diamond fighting to save his job. As pressure intensified on Britain’s highest paid banking boss to quit, MPs heard a string of other financial institutions across the world were under investigation. At least 20 banks are believed to be under suspicion, with growing demands for a criminal investigation. Barclays Bank Tower at Churchill Place, . Docklands: The bank has been fined £290million over attempts to rig . money market interest rates. HSBC is one of the twenty other banks also under investigation, it . emerged today . Barclays’ shares crashed by 15.5 per cent in a day as the implications sank in, wiping £3.7billion from its value, with other banks also hit. Barclays has been fined £290million after devastating emails revealed that its traders manipulated the London Interbank Rate (Libor) – the rate at which banks lend money to each other. Chancellor George Osborne told the Commons the exchanges ‘read like an epitaph to an age of irresponsibility’. On the blackest day for Britain’s finance industry since the 2008 economic crisis: . 'Epitaph to an age of irresponsibility': George Osborne today briefed MPs in the Commons about the unfolding bank trading scandal . David Cameron, who is at an EU summit in Brussels, described the situation as an ‘extremely serious scandal’. Mr Diamond, who was in charge of Barclays Capital at the time traders are now known to have been rigging the market, has offered to forgo his short-term bonus for this year. But he is still entitled to millions of pounds in salary and long-term share incentives. Asked how much wider the rate-fixing scandal might go, the Chancellor told MPs: ‘HSBC and RBS are two of the banks under investigation, but international banks such as UBS and Citigroup are under investigation too, partly for activities conducted in this country.’ Mr Osborne said the total impact on the economy and on individuals was ‘extremely difficult to work out, because the Libor rate was manipulated up as well as down’. ‘Sometimes the rate was too low for the true market price, and sometimes it was too high,’ he said. ‘The Financial Services Authority has made it clear, however, that that contributed to a risk to the country’s financial stability, and the cost of that is enormous.’ Tracey McDermott, director of enforcement at the FSA, said: ‘The initial indications are that Barclays was not the only firm that was involved in this.’ As well as RBS and HSBC, others under scrutiny include Lloyds, JPMorgan Chase, Germany’s Deutsche Bank and Bank of Tokyo Mitsubishi. A number of employees have already . been fired, suspended or put on gardening leave at various banks . including state-backed RBS, which has sacked and suspended ‘several’ staff, though the bank declined to comment. The alleged behaviour at RBS started when Fred Goodwin was chief executive . Royal Bank of Scotland managers are accused of colluding to rig the financial markets in court papers filed by a former employee. Tan Chi Min, a former head of delta trading for RBS’s global banking and markets division in Singapore, alleges that managers condoned collusion between its staff to set the Libor rate artificially high or low to maximise profits. He names five staff members he claims made requests for the Libor rate to be altered and three senior managers who he said knew what was going on. He also says the practice ‘was known to other members of [RBS]’s senior management’. Mr Tan, who was eventually sacked for gross misconduct, worked for RBS from August 2006 to November 2011 and it is believed the alleged behaviour started when Fred Goodwin, pictured, was chief executive. He claims that he was made a ‘scapegoat’ for malpractice condoned by managers and is suing for wrongful dismissal. In the court papers filed in New York as part of a class action, Mr Lin also implicates hedge fund bosses who have given thousands of pounds to the Conservative Party. It is claimed that hedge fund Brevan Howard asked RBS to fix financial data by making false submissions. The fund donated £10,000 to the Tories and spent £3,542 on flights for George Osborne to attend a conference in 2008. RBS said it was confident of mounting a successful defence against Mr Tan’s claims.Last night there were reports the bank is to be fined £150million for similar offences to those committed by Barclays. Lloyds . said it had suspended two traders. ICAP, the leading City broking firm . headed by Tory donor Michael Spencer, has also been dragged into the . scandal. It has suspended one employee and placed two on ‘administrative . leave’. A senior manager . at U.S. giant Citigroup’s Japanese operation left the firm late last . year after his division was temporarily banned from trading linked to . Libor and its Tokyo equivalent, Tibor, by the authorities. Giant Swiss bank UBS said it had approached regulators with information over abuses of the rate-setting system. The Libor rate is crucial, since it is a key benchmark for trillions of pounds’ worth of financial products. The . £290million fine on Barclays from the UK and U.S. authorities, issued . on Wednesday, is likely to be only the beginning of a wave of . punishments and civil suits for damages against other banks caught up in . the global web of deceit. Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds are two other UK-based banks under scrutiny as part of the probe . Experts said banks might have to set aside billions of pounds in damages to cover their liabilities resulting from the conspiracy. Former Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesman Lord Oakeshott said that once any criminal probe was underway, a public inquiry – like the one being conducted by Lord Leveson into media ethics – would have to be held. 'Clearly, the worms that are now crawling out from under the stones at the banking industry are even worse than any of us thought,’ he added. Speech: Bob Diamond alongside George Osborne at the Davos World Economic Forum . On 3 November 2011, Bob Diamond, . chief executive of Barclays, delivered the BBC Today programme’s . inaugural business lecture. Today, his words have come back to haunt . him. ‘Rebuilding trust requires banks  to be better citizens. I believe  in this passionately.’ Within a few months of making this statement, Barclays was found guilty . of a tax avoidance plot to rob taxpayers of around £500million. Earlier in 2011, it had been found guilty of enticing elderly customers . to gamble their life savings on the stock market. Around 12,000 . customers lost half their savings. And this week it was found guilty of a . ‘serious and widespread’ attempt to manipulate the Libor interest rates . and ordered to pay a fine of £290million. ‘I know how angry customers are about issues such as payment protection . insurance. That’s why we are working hard to clear claims as quickly as . possible. We want to put things right.’ When a person takes out a credit card or personal loan, they buy the . insurance to pay out if they lose their job, or have to stop working due . to poor health. But banks, including Barclays, were selling the . policies to people who did not need them. Barclays said the PPI scandal . would cost them £1billion. Four months after making this speech, he . admitted the bill had increased to £1.3billion. ‘But for me the evidence of culture is how people behave when no one is . watching them. Our culture must be one where the interests of customers . and clients are at the very heart of every decision we make, where we . all act with trust and integrity.’ The Financial Services Authority this week found Barclays guilty of . misconduct ‘extended over number of years’. The US Department of Justice . said simply that the bank was guilty of ‘illegal conduct’ on its . attempts to manipulate the Libor rate. The culture of Barclays allowed . traders to manipulate Libor in a bid to make sure they scooped millions . in bonuses, and to pretend the bank was in a healthier state than it . was.","Barclays shares drop 15 per cent as pressure on Diamond grows .

"It’s been a torrid three years for most people since the world economy began to go into meltdown. But not everyone has suffered. Investor Kyle Bass has already made millions from the credit crunch and he is set to increase . his money by almost 650 times from a Greek default. He founded hedge fund Hayman Capital in Dallas, Texas, in 2006 in his late 30s after saving $10million from selling bonds for Wall Street firms. In the money: Kyle Bass founded hedge fund Hayman Capital in Dallas, Texas, in 2006 after saving $10million from selling bonds for Wall Street firms . He made millions gambling against the . sub-prime mortgage bond market - and now he’s betting on the collapse of . whole countries in Europe. Mr Bass’s story so far has been documented in Michael Lewis’s new book 'Boomerang: The Meltdown Tour' - serialised in The Sunday Times. Mr Lewis charts how Mr Bass was one of only 15 people who placed ‘enormous bets that vast tracts of American finance would go up in flames’. Mr Bass believed as the sub-prime market collapsed that the financial crisis was being hidden by rich western governments. Clever man: Mr Bass made millions by gambling against sub-prime mortgage bond market - and now he's betting on the collapse of whole countries . He . said these nations had taken on ‘dodgy securities worth trillions’, as . worldwide debts doubled over just a few years to $195trillion. 'It may not be the end of the world. But a lot of people are going to lose a lot of money. Our . goal is not to be one of them' Kyle Bass . A big issue he identified was large banks being treated as ‘extensions of their governments, sure to be bailed out in a crisis’. Mr Bass spoke to Harvard economics . expert Kenneth Rogoff about sovereign balance sheets and finally . realised the scale of the problem when he presented him with some research. Professor Rogoff told Mr Bass: 'I can hardly believe it is this bad' after he had looked at their figures. Mr Bass replied: 'If you don’t know this, who does?’ and thought: 'Holy s**t, who is paying attention?' Falling prices: Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange in Manhattan last week, as the Dow Jones suffered another bad month . ‘The sub-prime mortgage crisis was more . symptom than cause,’ Mr Lewis wrote. ‘Deeper social and economic . problems that gave rise to it remained.’ 'I thought: ""Holy s**t, who is paying attention?""' Kyle Bass on sovereign troubles . This made Mr Bass believe another bigger economic crisis was brewing - and he started to buy ‘credit default swaps’ on European countries, according to the book serialisation in The Sunday Times. These let him bet against a bond’s price without owning it - like ‘default insurance on another person’s investments’. He believes Greece, Portugal, Ireland, Switzerland, Italy and Spain are the countries least likely to be . able to pay off their debts. New Book: Michael Lewis's Boomerang: The Meltdown Tour - which features Mr Bass, left - is out this week . He bought Greek default insurance for 11 basis points - meaning insuring $1m of bonds would cost $1,100 dollars a year. 'We’ve bought a lot of this stuff' Kyle Bass on his gold collection . A Greek default would make it pay down its debt by around 70 per cent, meaning every $1,100 bet would net him an astonishing $700,000, Mr Bass said. He said his mother tells him to put his money in 'guns and gold'. Mr Lewis recalled him pulling out a huge gold brick from his desk drawer and saying: 'We’ve bought a lot of this stuff.' Mr Bass, who lives in a 40,000 sq ft house, has also bought 20 million nickels for $1million. He said the metal inside each coin is worth 6.8 cents. ‘It may not be the end of the world,’ Mr Bass added. ‘But a lot of people are going to lose a lot of money. Our goal is not to be one of them.'","Kyle Bass founded hedge fund after saving $10million from Wall Street stint .

"A Ukrainian military base employee has made the sensational claim that a one his country's own air force planes shot down  Malaysian flight MH17 killing all 298 on board. The unnamed employee claimed to a Moscow newspaper that a Ukrainian air force Su-25 combat jet took off from an airbase in eastern Dnipropetrovsk carrying air-to-air missiles - and returned without them - on the day the Boeing 777 was shot out of the sky. The pilot on his return emerged from his cockpit looking frightened, said the source, according to Komsomolskaya Pravda. Scroll down for video . The unidentified official sits with his back to the camera and his face obscured during an interview with three men from Komsomolskaya Pravda, a Russian media outlet . The pilot, named as Captain Vladislav Voloshin, said 'the plane was in the wrong place at the wrong time' evidently having confused the Boeing for a military target, said the source. 'In the second half of the day, roughly an hour before the Boeing was shot down, three fighters took off,' said the source. 'I don't remember the exact hour. One of the jets was equipped with air-to-air missiles. It was a Sukhoi-25.' Only one plane returned to this air base, he said, and it was the one that previously had the missiles suspended below. Russia has repeatedly argued that MH17 was downed not by pro-Moscow rebels using a BUK missile system but by a Ukrainian warplane. The planes were normally deployed to strike at rebel targets in eastern Ukraine, he said, but this time the aircraft had air-to-air missiles fitted. 'They are suspended to a fighter jet only on a special order,' he said. 'Most typically, the commanders didn't order this because such missiles can't be carried in the air for no particular reason.' Emergency services workers sift through the debris of MH17 in Ukraine the day after it crashed . Wreckage of the downed aircraft smolders in the hours after it crashed in eastern Ukraine . He explained that these missiles had been decommissioned long before but their combat employment was urgently authorized again literally a week before the MH17 accident. He claimed that the missile would be capable of hitting a plane's fuselage, whether directly or from a distance of 500 meters. The man said he had gone to the Russian media despite threats from the Ukrainian secret service. He was against the war in eastern Ukraine, blaming the Kiev authorities for their use of force. A spokesman for Russia's powerful Investigative Committee later said the official's claims were truthful, following an interview and lie detector test administered by the committee itself. He said: 'According to his account, he personally saw the plane piloted by  Voloshin armed with R-60 air-to-air missiles. 'He added there was no need for such weapons during regular air missions of the Ukrainian Air Forces because the rebel forces had no military aircraft,' RT reported. Two members of the Ukrainian emergency services collect the body of a victim of MH17 . Soon after the horror on 17 July, the Russian Ministry of Defense claimed a Ukrainian Su-25 fighter plane was in the sky close to MH17. The version is starkly at odds with Ukrainian and Western theories on the downing of the plane. They have pointed to a ground-fired BUK missile as being responsible. Russia has also claimed its evidence has not been given due weight by a Dutch-led probe into disaster due to report in 2015. According to the preliminary information of the DSB, the Boeing was hit by a large number of high-energy objects penetrating the aircraft from outside, but the source of the objects was not found.

"Release: Charlie Gilmour leaving prison . Student rioter Charlie Gilmour has claimed prison officers tried to have him murdered by a psychopathic contract killer in jail. The adopted son of Pink Floyd’s David Gilmour claimed three ‘screws’ locked him in a cell with the assassin, whom they had ordered: ‘Do him in.’ Gilmour was jailed for 16 months after tuition fees protests in London spiralled into rioting in December 2010. He caused outrage by swinging from a flag on the Cenotaph while high on LSD, valium and whisky, before joining a mob which attacked a convoy carrying Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall. Gilmour, who is reading history at Girton College, Cambridge, was freed after serving just four months of his sentence for violent disorder. His remarks were denounced by sources close to Justice Secretary Chris Grayling as ‘patently, utterly absurd’. The student, in his mid-20s, does not appear to have mentioned the alleged incident in columns and interviews he has done since his release in November 2011, leading critics to suggest it might not be true. Gilmour also attacked the Ministry of Justice for seeking to ‘paint prisoners as the violent architects of their own doing’. In a self-pitying rant, he said threats to his life during his time in HMP Wandsworth – a Category B prison housing some of the most dangerous convicts – had come not ‘from my fellow inmates [but] people in positions of power and responsibility’. He described talking to an inmate, ‘Mack’, who was serving a life sentence for killing people for money. Gilmour told a Howard League For Penal Reform conference in London last month: ‘There was no doubt he was a contract killer. He was also an incredibly engaging storyteller. So … I didn’t notice the prison officer come into the cell until it was too late. ‘“You’re staying in here, Gilmour,” he said … as he locked us both in. Mack had a history of extreme violence, so was not supposed to share a cell with anyone.’ Rampage: Gilmour was jailed for 16 months after tuition fees protests in London spiralled into rioting in December 2010.He caused outrage by swinging from a flag on the Cenotaph . He added: ‘Mack looked me dead in the eye. “I’ve been asked to do you in … Three screws came to me asking if I’ll do it. Ex-military. Queen and country types. They don’t like what you did and they know what I can do.”’ Gilmour said ‘Mack’ had added: ‘I told them to f*** off. You’re one of us now.’ But the student said that during his time in jail ‘prison officers deliberately placed me in life-threatening situations on several occasions’. He accused the Ministry of Justice of a ‘deeply cynical propaganda campaign’ blaming inmates for prison violence – even though National Offender Management Service figures show serious assaults on prison officers rose 45 per cent in the two years to 2012. A Ministry of Justice source said: ‘Claiming that we run some kind of third-world despotic prison system staffed by corrupt thugs who try to get inmates to kill each other is patently, utterly absurd.’ Mr Grayling said: ‘Our staff … are highly professional … they do an incredibly good job in difficult and challenging environments.’ David Gilmour, left, pictured with son Charlie and wife Polly Samson at Kingston Crown Court in July 2011 .","Rioter Charlie Gilmour claims prison officers tried to have him murdered .

"America is in the grip of a pornography pandemic that has become so serious it should be treated the same way as teenage smoking or drink driving, activists have warned.

Speaking ahead of a two-day conference on sexual exploitation, she said, if left untreated, addiction to pornography can leave users with psychological damage. Dangers: Speaking ahead of a two-day conference on sexual exploitation, campaigners said, if left untreated, addiction to pornography can leave users with psychological damage . 'There’s a lot of science now proving that pornography is harmful,' Hawkins said at the National Press Club in Washington. 'We know now that almost every family in America has been touched by the harm of pornography.' The Coalition to End Sexual Exploitation summit - beginning today - aims to look at pornography as a complex social problem that needs to be framed as a public health issue. Empowering? Miriam Weeks - a 19-year-old women's studies student at elite Duke University caused a national stir recently when she came out as moonlighting Internet porn star Belle Knox . Participants include health professionals, social workers, academics, feminists, faith leaders, campaigners against human trafficking and former members of the multibillion-dollar adult entertainment industry. 'This is a business with considerable political clout,' said Gail Dines, a sociology and women’s studies professor at Wheelock College in Boston and author of 'Pornland: How Porn Has Hijacked Our Sexuality.' Porn sites get more visitors per month than Netflix, Amazon and Twitter combined, a third of all downloads contain porn and the Internet now hosts 4.2 million porn websites, said Dines, who is also president of the international feminist group Stop Porn Culture. 'Porn is without doubt the most . powerful form of sex education today, with studies showing that the . average age of first viewing porn is between 11 and 14 — and let me tell . you, this is not your father’s Playboy,' she said. 'These . degrading misogynist images have become the wallpaper of our lives and . they are robbing young people of an authentic healthy sexuality that is a . basic right of every human being.' Donny Pauling, a former adult film . producer for Playboy and others who also ran a network of adult websites . before quitting the business in 2006, said he has personally seen the . ill effects of the porn business on the women who appear in front of the . camera. He doubted that Miriam Weeks — a . 19-year-old women’s studies student at elite Duke University who caused a . national stir recently when she came out as moonlighting Internet porn . star Belle Knox — feels as 'empowered' as she has claimed. 'I . don’t buy her story,' Pauling said. 'I recruited more than 500 . first-timers into the business and there’s never been one that came back . and thanked me.' 'These degrading misogynist images . have become the wallpaper of our lives and they are robbing young people . of an authentic healthy sexuality that is a basic right of every human . being' - Gail Dines, author of 'Pornland: . How Porn Has Hijacked Our Sexuality' Mary Anne Layden of the University of Pennsylvania, who specializes in sexual trauma, said pornography has been a factor in every case of sexual violence that she has treated as a psychotherapist. 'The earlier males are exposed to pornography, the more likely they are to engage in non-consensual sex — and for females, the more pornography they use, the more likely they are to be victims of non-consensual sex,' she said. In an interview with Rolling Stone earlier this month, Weeks revealed that she started watching pornography at the age of 12 — and that she was once raped at a high school house party. 'There is going to have to be programs out there that get kids to understand how porn is manipulating them,' Dines said. And Layden suggested that if the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention got 'interested in this as a public health issue, we can have success in the way that we had success with the issue of cigarette smoking.'","Campaigners say porn use should be viewed as major public health crisis .

"A couple found dead at their home had a Christmas dinner with their disabled children before killing themselves, friends said. Julia and Jan Tshabalala had their family meal a day early on Christmas Eve, then sent their two young children to stay with relatives. The next morning they were found dead in an apparent suicide pact. Jan Tshabalala, left, died along with his wife Julia, right, at their home in Billingshurst, West Sussex in an apparent suicide pact . Neighbours said they had seemed to be a ‘nice happy family’. The couple’s daughter, Serena, had cerebral palsy, although she did not need a wheelchair, while their son, Junior, had learning difficulties. ‘They were very nice people,’ said their next-door neighbour, who asked not to be named. ‘We used to receive Christmas cards from them. They were a very private couple, but we would always speak to them over the fence. They always seemed like a happy couple, but you never really know do you?’ Police visited the rented £150,000 home in Billingshurst, West Sussex, on Christmas Day after a relative went to the house just after 9am. He apparently looked through a window and saw Jan, 33, who worked as a carer, hanging in a room. His wife Julia, in her 30s, was also dead inside. Yesterday, the couple’s white Kia 4x4 was outside their home, and a police officer was seen feeding the family’s pet rabbits. Their children, thought to be aged between four and seven, go to a local school specialising in learning difficulties. Police outside the West Sussex home where the parents of two young children were found dead yesterday . Residents said that the situation was ‘absolutely awful’. There were rumours the couple had been in financial trouble, although friends dismissed the idea. One neighbour said: ‘I’d see the man in his front garden sometimes and he would wave. She was a good mother, I would see her at the swings in the park with her kids. They were completely normal and pleasant.’ Another said: ‘I last saw Julia on Christmas Eve and she seemed happy. Julia didn’t work and just looked after the kids. The little girl has cerebral palsy – she’s a lovely little girl, very quiet. And the boy has learning difficulties too. But she never said she was struggling.’ A third said: ‘I was the one who got in and found them. It’s been a real shock.’ Another said: ‘I heard from other neighbours that they had financial worries. I am in absolute shock and how tragic for the children.’ The couple were both declared dead at the scene. Sussex Police said post-mortem examinations will be carried out and it was not clear whether Mrs Tshabalala suffered injuries or was suffocated. Police sealed off the house but declined to reveal if suicide notes had been found, saying: ‘Officers are working to establish the circumstances of the death but are not looking for anyone else in connection with this incident.’","Police called to home of Jan and Julia Tshabalala on Christmas morning .

"A woman was found guilty on Friday of stealing her cancer-stricken neighbor's dog and having it euthanized. Gisele Paris, is facing jail after she stole Mark Boheler's Siberian husky called Thor from his back yard in Spring Hill, Pennsylvania on Thanksgiving Day last year. The 58-year-old, who owns a cocker spaniel, then asked a licensed veterinarian to come to her home where she had the animal put down. Scroll down for videos . Gisele Paris (pictured leaving court today), is facing jail after she stole her neighbor's Siberian husky called Thor from his back yard in Spring Hill, Pennsylvania on Thanksgiving Day last year . Her attorney claimed that she believed the dog was sick and neglected so had it euthanized in her home by a licensed veterinarian . Initially the dog was thought to be missing, but when the owner was going through treatment for cancer, he found out it had been killed . Mr Boheler was going through treatment for stage three cancer at the time and pleaded for the dog's safe return because he initially thought it was just missing. But he was left devastated when he found out his beloved pet was dead. Paris' lawyer maintained throughout that she had taken the dog for a walk but then took it in to care for it because she believed he was being neglected. She told the jury that he was 'tired and thirsty' and eating out of a garbage can. Paris then testified that she took the dog into her home, cleaned it and took it to the Animal Rescue League where nobody claimed it. However prosecutors said that she had taken it to Penn Animal Hospital and when she learned it would cost $600 for an operation, she had it put down instead. Mr Boheler  told WPXI: 'I was thrilled to death she got convicted. If somebody did that to her dog, she would be crying like a baby. She knew what she did. She took that dog. 'I hope she does time for it so she can sit in jail and think about what she did.' Mr Boehler posted on Facebook at the beginning of Paris's trial. He testified against her during the case . Mark Boheler was going through treatment for stage three cancer at the time and pleaded for the dog's safe return because he initially thought his beloved pet was just missing . A police officer said that every time she spoke with Mr Boheler about the case, he cried . After the guilty verdict was passed, Mr Boheler said he was thrilled with the outcome and hopes she is given jail time as a result. The most severe sentence would be 10 years in prison . He added that he believes Paris buried Thor's remains and wants them returned to her. Pittsburgh police Officer Christine Luffey arrested Paris in February and said she agreed with the jury's decision. She said: 'The jury got it right. I have spoken to Mark Boehler throughout this whole ordeal. Every time we talked, he cried.' Following the guilty verdict, Paris was placed under house arrest and will only be allowed out of the house to walk her own dog. The sentence varies from probation to 10 years in prison. She is also facing trial for minor assault and resisting arrest following an incident in February. She is scheduled be in court for that hearing in April. The district attorney said the vet who put Thor down acted responsibly. Following the guilty verdict, Paris was placed under house arrest and will only be allowed out of the house to walk her own dog .

"A woman is celebrating this Christmas after being reunited with her engagement ring which she had feared was lost forever. Hayley Plack, 27, only realized her precious ring was missing after she had boarded a train leaving Washington D.C. on Friday. The 1.1-carat oval diamond ring, a family heirloom, had been given to her on Thanksgiving Day by her now-fiance Andrew Frank. After failing to find the ring on the train, Hayley panicked that she might never see it again. Hayley Plack, 27, is celebrating this Christmas after being reunited with her 1.1-carat oval diamond engagement ring which she had feared was lost forever when it went missing on Friday . The 1.1-carat oval diamond ring, a family heirloom, had been given to her on Thanksgiving Day by her now-fiance Andrew Frank . The ring had belonged to her 32-year-old fiance’s grandmother and she had even insisted on being given the heirloom instead of a new ring, reports The Washington Post. Despite her fiance's grave doubts that they would ever see the ring again, he tried to offer his future wife some encourage that  someone might find the ring and return it to them. 'Not everyone in the world is a criminal,' he told her. Hayley quickly started a campaign to track down the ring using Craiglist ads, local blogs. She also inquired at local pawn shops in case someone had tried to sell it. Fortunately for her, a 55-year-old man who lived just four doors down from the couple had found the diamond ring on the sidewalk in front of his apartment building. Siranjan Kulatilake initially thought the ring belonged to a child because of the small size of the band. The ring had belonged to Hayley's 32-year-old fiance’s grandmother and she had even insisted on being given the heirloom instead of a new ring . He picked it up and hooked it onto his keys to keep it safe while he went about his work as a dog walker. Back at his apartment he wondered what to do with the ring. ‘It’s obviously precious to someone,’ he said. The next morning, his wife was out walking when she discovered one of the fliers Hayley had posted that read ‘Lost Engagement Ring. Reward Will Be Offered.’ The flier also included Hayley's phone number and so Kulatilake’s left her a voice mail message  delivering the good news that he may have found her lost ring. Hayley was so overjoyed to get her ring back that when Kulatilake said he would prefer his reward to go to the Washington Humane Society, she gave them a check for $400 rather than the $50 he had requested.

"Shocking figures revealed today that one in 15 people in America is now living in poverty. The number - a record high - is spread widely across metropolitan areas as the country's economic troubles continue to bite. And almost 15 per cent of the population are also now on food . stamps, it emerged yesterday. The ranks of the poor applying for . food stamps increased by a worrying 8.1 per cent over the past year to . make a total of 45.8 million. Hand out nation: America's economic troubles are continuing to bite with almost 15% of the US population now on food stamps . The increase in poverty is believed to have been caused . due to the housing bust pushing many inner-city poor into suburbs and . other outlying places and shriveled jobs and income. 'There now really is no unaffected . group, except maybe the very top income earners,' said Robert Moffitt, a . professor of economics at Johns Hopkins University. 'Recessions are . supposed to be temporary, and when it's over, everything returns to . where it was before. But the worry now is that the downturn — which will . end eventually — will have long-lasting effects on families who lose . jobs, become worse off and can't recover.' Reliant: The ranks of the poor applying for food stamps increased by a worrying 8.1% over the past year to make a total of 45.8 million (stock photo) Split societies: The top ten cities where there is the greatest divide between rich and poor . Once-booming Sun Belt metro areas are now seeing some of the biggest jumps in concentrated poverty. 1 Mississippi 21.5%2 New Mexico 20.7%3 Oregon 20.6%4 Tennessee 20.2%5 Louisiana 19.9% . About 20.5 million Americans, or 6.7 . per cent of the U.S. population, make up the poorest poor, defined as . those at 50 per cent or less of the official poverty level. Those living in deep poverty represent . nearly half of the 46.2 million people scraping by below the poverty . line. In 2010, the poorest poor meant an income of $5,570 or less for an . individual and $11,157 for a family of four. That 6.7 percent . share is the highest in the 35 years that the Census Bureau has . maintained such records, surpassing previous highs in 2009 and 1993 of . just over 6 percent. After declining during the 1990s . economic boom, the proportion of poor people in large metropolitan areas . who lived in high-poverty neighborhoods jumped from 11.2 per cent in . 2000 to 15.1 per cent last year, according to a Brookings Institution . analysis released on Thursday. As a whole, the number of poor in the . suburbs who lived in high-poverty neighborhoods rose by 41 per cent . since 2000, more than double the growth of such city neighborhoods. Graph: Suburban households are less likely to receive SNAP benefits, but usage is on the rise with about nine per cent of households . Poverty for Americans 65 and older is . on track to nearly double after factoring in rising out-of-pocket . medical expenses, from nine per cent to more than 15 per cent. Poverty increases are also anticipated . for the working-age population because of commuting and child-care . costs, while child poverty will dip partly due to the positive effect of . food stamps. The number of people seeking unemployment benefits fell to the lowest in five weeks, government data showed on Thursday, in a hopeful sign for the struggling job market. Initial jobless claims totalled 397,000 in the week ending October 29, down from a revised 406,000 claims the previous week, the Labor Department reported. The claims number was lower than the average analyst estimate of 401,000, and provided a positive reading on the depressed job market ahead of Friday's October jobs data. It was the third time in six months that weekly initial jobless claims have fallen below 400,000. Last week's reading was the lowest since September 24, when claims stood at 395,000. But applications need to fall consistently below 375,000 to signal sustainable job growth. They haven't been below that level since February. Applications have been above 400,000 for all but two weeks since March. The figures come a day before the government releases its October jobs report. Analysts expect employers added 100,000 net jobs, nearly the same as the 103,000 added in September. The unemployment rate is expected to stay at 9.1 per cent for a fourth straight month. Employers have added an average of only 72,000 jobs per month in the past five months. That's far below the 100,000 per month needed to keep up with population growth. And it's down from an average of 180,000 in the first four months of this year. And with one in 15 in poverty, more than one in four of working age are now tapping food stamps. According to Department of . Agriculture figures, worst hit were people in Mississippi, where more . than 21 per cent were recipients. One . in five residents in Tennessee, Oregon, New Mexico and Louisiana also . depended on the hand outs - formally known as the Supplemental Nutrition . Assistance Program (SNAP) - to eat. Officials fear the numbers may swell even more in the coming months as people battle financial hardship and record unemployment. But . one reason for the rising number of recipients was that many states . have waived requirements limiting the assets food stamp applicants could . own, said the Wall Street Journal. The number of food stamp users . exploded after the recession hit in late 2007 and has continued growing . even though the downtown is officially supposed to be over. Researchers . from the Carsey Institute at the University of New Hampshire estimated . that the percentage of Americans receiving food stamps increased by 61.2 . per cent  between 2007 and 2010. Reliance on the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Programme was very high among single parents, rising ten per cent. In . 2010, 42 per cent of single mothers and 25 per cent of single fathers . relied on the stamps. In rural areas it was ever higher at one in two . single mothers. States also . made changes to make it easier for residents to tap into the program, . such as waiving requirements that limited the value of assets food stamp . recipients could own. This is believed to have been caused . due to the housing bust pushing many inner-city poor into suburbs and . other outlying places and shriveled jobs and income. 'There now really is no unaffected . group, except maybe the very top income earners,' said Robert Moffitt, a . professor of economics at Johns Hopkins University. 'Recessions are . supposed to be temporary, and when it's over, everything returns to . where it was before. But the worry now is that the downturn — which will . end eventually — will have long-lasting effects on families who lose . jobs, become worse off and can't recover.' The institute also found that 14.6 per cent of rural households were relying on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Programme in 2010. Suburban households are less likely to receive SNAP benefits, but usage is on the rise. About nine per cent of suburban households received SNAP in 2010, up from 5.4 pe rcent in 2007. Jessica Bean, a vulnerable families research associate with the Carsey Institute, said she thinks rural residents have traditionally been less likely to collect SNAP benefits because they live in remote areas where it’s hard to access social services and are more concerned with the social stigma. In a rural area, she said: 'When you go into the grocery store and you pull out your food stamps card, everybody knows you.' Just one in ten married couples with children are using the government-funded food benefit.","Worst hit states are Mississippi, Tennessee, Oregon, New Mexico and Louisiana .

"An Ohio couple was robbed of their four puppies on Christmas morning because they had no cash to offer their burglars. Three men slipped through an unlocked sliding door at the northeast Ohio home at around 6 a.m. Thursday, a Wayne County sheriff's captain said. The suspects confronted a 32-year-old man in semi-rural Chippewa Township, authorities say. This poster has been issued since the burglary to help find the stolen puppies . The man was struck in the face with a handgun, and a 21-year-old woman was held up at gunpoint. When the suspects' demands for cash weren't met, the men scooped up the three-week-old Cane Corso puppies and fled. Cane Corsos are an Italian mastiff-type dog that can serve as watchdogs and hunters. Capt. Doug Hunter says the puppies' chances of survival are slim because they're not yet weaned. The puppies' mother wasn't taken.","The male victim, 32, was struck in the face with a handgun and woman, 21, was held up at gunpoint .

The hospital wedding made the occasion more about their family and the people who have been caring for Billy, she said. Plus, Sarah said after the ceremony: 'It shows we’re going to be together for the long haul.” Lewis and Cramer live in Mogadore, in suburban Akron. Hospital workers prepared quickly for the wedding, which took just over a week.

"These  pictures show the moment a Ukrainian mother embraced her son after he was released by pro-Russian rebels. The man was among at least three prisoners of war handed over to relatives without any conditions by rebels in the Luhansk People's Republic. But a larger exchange of hundreds of prisoners between Ukrainian forces and the pro-Russians was embroiled in controversy, with reports suggesting the swap has been pushed back a day.

The man was among three prisoners of war handed over to relatives without any conditions by rebels in the Luhansk People's Republic . The rebels had been set to release 150 Ukrainian prisoners in exchange for Kiev handing over 222 captives, government and rebel officials confirmed. Russian state television today showed Ukrainian prisoners of war boarding buses in the main rebel stronghold of Donetsk before being driven to a location north of the city where the exchange was set to take place. But a news agency in Russia quoted an official in the eastern city, who said the exchange was pushed back to tomorrow. The conflicting reports could not be independently confirmed. Discussions leading up to the planned prisoner swap led up to scheduled peace talks between Russian and Ukraine in Minsk, Belarus, which have since been called off. Previous rounds of talks in September led to a cease-fire and an agreement to pull back heavy weapons, but fighting has continued between the two sides.

"Just 96,000 American jobs were added in August in a bleak monthly jobs report as 368,000 left the workforce, bringing labour market participation down to its lowest level for 31 years and dealing a blow to President Barack Obama’s re-election chances. The national unemployment rate dropped to 8.1 per cent, down from 8.2 per cent, but this was only because so many people gave up looking for work. If the participation rate had not dropped so precipitously, unemployment would have risen to 8.4 per cent. Factory employment fell by the most in two years and temporary-help companies eliminated positions for the first time in five months. The 69.9 per cent labor force participation rate for men is at lowest level recorded since the US government began tracking it in 1948. According to James Pethokoukis of the American Enterprise Institute, the unemployment rate would be 11.2 per cent if the labour force participation rate had remained what it was when Obama took office in January 2009. The U.S. Labour Department also said that 41,000 fewer jobs were created in June and July than previously reported. President Barack Obama was made aware of the figures before he took the stage to deliver his prime-time address at the Democratic convention on Thursday night, which could account for his sometimes grim demeanour as he spoke. Scroll down for video . Bleak: Barack Obama spoke without the exuberance that marked his earlier campaigns at the DNC speech last night . In a biting statement, Romney said: 'If last night was the party, this morning is the hangover. For every net new job created, nearly four Americans gave up looking for work . entirely. This is more of the same for middle class families who are suffering . through the worst economic recovery since the Great Depression. 'After 43 . straight months of unemployment above eight per cent, it is clear that President Obama just . hasn't lived up to his promises and his policies haven't worked. We aren’t . better off than they were four years ago. My plan for a stronger middle class . will create 12 million new jobs by the end of my first term. America deserves new . leadership that will get our economy moving again.' On Thursday night, Obama laid out his case for being re-elected to a second term by comparing himself to Franklin D. Roosevelt, who won an unprecedented four presidential elections and led America to recovery after the Great Depression. Stalling: The growth of new jobs has taken a significant dip compared to the beginning of the year . The grim economic data came as Obama and Romney were deadlocked in the national opinion polls in a race that has been too close to call for many months. It was the last opportunity for either man to use a defined 'moment' to change the trajectory of the race before the three presidential debates in October. 'And the truth is, it will take more than a few years for us to solve challenges that have built up over decades. It will require common effort, shared responsibility, and the kind of bold, persistent experimentation that Franklin Roosevelt pursued during the only crisis worse than this one.' Early in the speech, he lit into his opponents, saying all the Republicans have 'to offer is the same prescription they’ve had for the last 30 years: ""Have a surplus? Try a tax cut. Deficit too high? Try another. Feel a cold coming on? Take two tax cuts, roll back some regulations, and call us in the morning!""' All smiles: Obama and his family were optimistic about the future at the convention last night . Where's my hope? The 69.9 per cent labor force participation rate for men is at lowest level ever recorded . Can Obama save America's economy as Roosevelt did during the Great Depression? Can Obama save America's economy as Roosevelt did during the Great Depression? Now share your opinion . Obama's address, switched from a 74,000-seater stadium to a 20,000-seater arena ostensibly because of the weather but amid indications there were problems filling seats, brought the three-day democratic convention to a close. Judging by the reaction of the crowd, . Obama's speech paled into insignificance compared to the rollicking . address by former President Bill Clinton on Wednesday night and the . emotional, affecting speech by his wife Michelle on Tuesday. It was also . not as rousing as Vice President Joe Biden's speech just beforehand. Obama is attempting to frame the election not as a referendum on his four-year term, during which unemployment has risen to 8.3 per cent, leaving more than 23 million Americans out of work, but as a choice between him and Mitt Romney, the Republican nominee. 'On every issue, the choice you face won’t be just between two candidates or two parties,' he said. 'It will be a choice between two different paths for America. A choice between two fundamentally different visions for the future.' Not so good: The unemployment rate dropped to 8.1 per cent but this was only because so many people gave up looking for work . Recalling his speech at the 2004 convention, he said: 'Eight years later, that hope has been tested - by the cost of war; by one of the worst economic crises in history; and by political gridlock that’s left us wondering whether it’s still possible to tackle the challenges of our time.' He needed more time, he insisted, to fix things. 'I won’t pretend the path I’m offering is quick or easy. I never have. You didn’t elect me to tell you what you wanted to hear,' the president said. 'You elected me to tell you the truth. And the truth is, it will take more than a few years for us to solve challenges that have built up over decades.' Although his demeanour hardly showed it, Obama tried to strike an optimistic note by saying: 'But know this, America: Our problems can be solved. Our challenges can be met. The path we offer may be harder, but it leads to a better place. I’m asking you to chose that future.' Comparison: Barack Obama invoked the spirit of President Franklin D. Roosevelt who led America out of the Great Depression . In . an earnest request for four more years, he said: 'But know this, . America: Our problems can be solved. Our challenges can be met. The path . we offer may be harder, but it leads to a better place. 'And . I’m asking you to choose that future. I’m asking you to rally around a . set of goals for your country – goals in manufacturing, energy, . education, national security, and the deficit; a real, achievable plan . that will lead to new jobs, more opportunity, and rebuild this economy . on a stronger foundation. 'That’s what we can do in the next four years, and that’s why I’m running for a second term as President of the United States.' This November's election, he argued, will represent 'the clearest choice of any time in a generation' between two different visions. 'Over the next few years, big decisions will be made in Washington, on jobs and the economy; taxes and deficits; energy and education; war and peace – decisions that will have a huge impact on our lives and our children’s lives for decades to come. Roosevelt . dominated American politics for the 12 years of his presidency and . beyond. He is commonly recognised as the greatest Democratic president . and, along with George Washington and Abraham Lincoln, one of the three . greatest American presidents. Not . only did he bring America out of the depression, he oversaw the . introduction of the New Deal social programmes, laid the foundations for . the United Nations and led the country in the Second World War after . the Japanese bombing of Pearl Harbor, dying just when victory was in . sight. Obama . also laid out a series of 'goals for America' in a second term. These . will include creating a million new manufacturing jobs by the end of . 2016, doubling exports by the end of 2014 and cutting net oil imports in . half by 2020.","Lowest workforce participation rate since September 1981 .

"The true number of jobs in danger from the collapse of parcel delivery firm City Link could top 3,700 – 1,000 more than previously feared. Bosses at the troubled firm were branded ‘cowards’ after workers only discovered their jobs were at risk via news reports on Christmas Day revealing the business had gone into administration. The company employs 2,727 people and said they had been paid until the end of this month. Substantial redundancies are imminent. The true number in jobs in danger of being lost after the collapse of parcel delivery firm City Link could top 3,700 . However, it emerged yesterday that the livelihoods of a further 1,000 contractors not directly employed by City Link, but who work for the firm as self-employed drivers or agency support staff, are also under threat. They will be treated as ‘unsecured creditors’ by administrators and are unlikely to receive any further salaries owed until all creditor claims have been assessed. One creditor claimed that he was owed almost £300,000, but administrators said he would be ‘lucky’ to get a penny for every pound owed. City Link went into administration on Christmas Eve and customers waiting for deliveries must now collect orders from depots next week. Its online parcel tracking system remains available, and a phone helpline will be open today and on Monday. Customers have been asked to pick up their parcels as soon as possible after depots re-open on Monday. The firm had been delivering 60million parcels a year for several High Street chains. John Lewis has transferred all its business to other carriers following its collapse. Unions demanded an urgent meeting with Business Secretary Vince Cable and said it was an ‘absolute disgrace’ staff had learned their jobs were in jeopardy on Christmas Day. Worker Mark Critchley discovered via his union, not from his managers, he faced redundancy. Staff who had discussed rumours the firm was in trouble were threatened with disciplinary action by managers, he said. Outside the firm’s main base in Coventry, he told Sky News: ‘We would like them to come down here and man up and tell us what’s going on and why they have done it… They’re all very cowardly men who will not face the music.’ City Link went into administration on Christmas Eve and customers waiting for deliveries must now collect orders from depots next week . Mr Cable said the firm’s collapse was a bitter blow to the workforce, adding he would happily meet the union in the New Year.’ RMT general secretary Mick Cash said employees ‘worked their socks off’ for Christmas, only to learn a day later that their jobs were in danger. He questioned whether the firm had fallen prey to ‘classic asset stripping’ after it was sold to venture capitalists Better Capital, owned by Tory donor Jon Moulton, for just £1 last year by Rentokil. Administrators EY were appointed after close of business on Christmas Eve. Responding to the RMT’s claim of ‘asset stripping’, an EY spokesman said Better Capital invested £40million in City Link and had not received any return on its investment. The private equity group is one of the firm’s ‘secured creditors’, meaning it will get a priority ranking in any distribution from the realisation of City Link’s asset, EY said. In a leaked internal email from City Link’s chief executive Dave Smith, he told staff: ‘With the business still incurring losses the company was faced with the situation of imminently running out of cash.’ The firm had made a loss since 2007, and Rentokil had written off millions when it owned the company. Better Capital said it could not comment further while the stock market remains closed.","True number of jobs at risk due to collapse of City Link could top 3,700 .

"President Obama woke up the day after Christmas for a session in the gym and a trip to the beach with his family. He exercised at the Marine Corps Base Hawaii before joining wife Michelle, and daughters Malia and Sasha under the sunny skies at the Bellows Air Force Station in Waimanalo. Later in the day, after a week of golfing, the president hit the links again with friends Greg Orme, Bobby Titcomb and Mike Ramos, the White House said. This time, they played at the Royal Hawaiian Golf Club in Kailua, a lush course with views of the Koolau Mountains. The club is currently under renovation and only has nine holes open, according to its website. Scroll down for video . A police Jet Ski patrols a beach near where President Barack Obama and the first family are spending time at Bellows Air Force Station, Hawaii . President Barack Obama, left, and first lady Michelle Obama, with ponytail, are seen in silhouetted profiles as the motorcade carrying the first family leaves their rental home  in Kailua, Hawaii, on Friday . On the way back to the Kailua vacation home on Friday, a child sat on a shirtless man's shoulders watching the passing motorcade and children jumped on a trampoline. After waking up on Christmas morning the family gathered in their home to open Christmas gifts and sing carols, the White House said. After a few cloudy and rainy days, a sun-soaked Christmas meant that they could return to the beach. In the late afternoon, he spoke to a few hundred troops in a mess hall at Marine Corps Base Hawaii, where troops and their families had just wrapped up a Christmas dinner including turkey, ham, lobster, candied yams and green beans. After brief remarks, Obama was taking photos in private with the troops and their families. During his Christmas Address, which aired on Thursday he paid tribute to servicemen as the 10-year mission in Afghanistan drew to a close. 'Because of the extraordinary service of the men and women in the American armed forces, Afghanistan has a chance to rebuild its own country,' Obama said to applause from Marines and their families. 'We are safer. It's not going to be a source of terrorist attacks again.' In wishing all Americans a Merry Christmas as part of their annual address, President Barack Obama and first lady Michelle turned the focus to the sacrifice of U.S. troops and their families, and how the combat mission in Afghanistan would soon be over. 'We're able to gather with family and friends because our troops are willing to hug theirs goodbye and step forward to serve,' Obama said in the speech. 'After a long day, we can come home because they're willing to leave their families and deploy. 'We can celebrate the holidays because they're willing to miss their own,' Obama said. 'And so, as our troops continue to transition back home - back to our businesses, our schools, our congregations, and our communities - it's up to all of us to serve them as well as they have served us.'

President Barack Obama, with first lady Michelle Obama, speaks to troops and their families on Christmas Day, at a Marine Corps Base Hawaii in Kaneohe Bay, Hawaii during the Obama family vacation . Thirteen years and $1 trillion later, the U.S. is preparing to pull the vast majority of its combat troops out of Afghanistan by year's end, as the U.S. and its partners seek to turn the page on a bloody chapter that started the day that al-Qaida militants struck American soil on Sept. 11, 2011. From a peak 140,000 troops in 2010, the U.S. and NATO plan to leave just 13,500 behind for training and battlefield support. Although there are reasons for cautious optimism, including a new Afghan president whose seriousness of effort has inspired U.S. confidence, the broader picture still looks glim. The U.S. is shifting to a supporting role after the bloodiest year in Afghanistan since the 2001 U.S.-led invasion. Civilian casualties this year are on track to hit 10,000, and some 5,000 Afghan forces were also killed in 2014, a figure that has escalated as the country took on a greater role in its own security. Insurgents have seized territory across the country, raising fears that Islamic militants will successfully exploit the security vacuum formed as the U.S. pulls out. Roughly 2,200 U.S. troops were killed in Afghanistan over the last 13 years in a war that cost the U.S. $1 trillion, plus another $100 billion for reconstruction. A celebratory cheer of 'hooah' rang out from the hundreds of troops here when Obama affirmed that the combat mission was finally ending. The motorcade carrying President Barack Obama from the gym is seen as it passes a large tree decorated for Christmas . 'We still have some very difficult missions around the world — including in Iraq,' Obama said. But, he added, 'the world is better, it's safer, it's more peaceful, it's more prosperous and our homeland protected because of you.' On the U.S. mainland and across the globe, other prominent leaders were fanning out, echoing the president's message with their own Christmas visits and phone calls to American troops. Vice President Joe Biden and his wife, Jill, visited Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland, to spend time with wounded troops and their families and express gratitude for their service. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel called military members on deployment, the Pentagon said, including those in Afghanistan and others assigned to U.S. Central Command, which is running the U.S. mission to fight the Islamic State group in Iraq and Syria. Senator. John McCain, was spending Christmas in Kabul, Afghanistan, where the former Navy pilot met Thursday with Afghan President Ashraf Ghani and his chief executive officer, Abdullah Abdullah. A chief critic of Obama's foreign policy, McCain is set to lead the Senate Armed Services Committee next year.","Obama woke up and went to the gym at the Marine Corps Base .

"The nephew of a couple killed in the Glasgow bin lorry crash has said he does not blame the driver for their deaths and hopes he 'makes a speedy recovery'. In a series of online messages, Marc Gardiner thanked the emergency services for doing everything possible for 68-year-old Jack and 69-year-old Lorraine Sweeney and their granddaughter Erin McQuade, 18, who died in the accident. He also urged people not to criticise the driver of the lorry that  ploughed in to pedestrians in the city centre and said the messages of support received by the family had meant a lot. Erin's mother Jacqueline, 43, is thought to have survived because she had gone to withdraw money from a cash machine during the family's Christmas shopping trip. The nephew of 68-year-old Jack Sweeney (pictured) killed in the Glasgow bin lorry crash has urged people not to blame the driver of the lorry that killed six people . 69-year-old Lorraine Sweeney (left) and her granddaughter Erin McQuade, 18, were also killed in the accident . Gillian Ewing (left), from Edinburgh, and primary school teacher Stephenie Tait (right) were also killed . Jacqueline Morton, 51, (pictured) a tax worker from the city, also died when the council truck mounted the pavement before crashing in to the side of the Millennium Hotel in George Square . Mr Gardiner tweeted: 'Been a really emotional and overwhelming day and on behalf of my family I just want to say thank you to everyone around Scotland sending in their condolences and best wishes! 'I hope that the other families that are going through what me and my family are get all the support possible and I hope that the driver of the lorry makes a speedy recovery and understands that it wasn't his fault. 'And a big thanks to all emergency services yesterday for doing everything possible. 'RIP Uncle Jackie, Aunt Lorraine and Erin, love you loads and can't believe you're gone, you'll be truly missed.' He added: 'It means a lot, that the people of Glasgow are coming together for my family and the other families affected.' This picture shows the truck, still moving, seconds before it crashed into the Millennium Hotel in Glasgow . Stephenie Tait, a 29-year-old primary teacher in Glasgow, Jacqueline Morton, 51, a tax worker from the city, and Gillian Ewing, 52, from Edinburgh, also died when the council truck mounted the pavement before crashing in to the side of the Millennium Hotel in George Square. Four people, including two teenage girls, are still being treated in hospital following the accident. Three females - a 14-year old girl, an 18-year-old and a woman aged 64 - are all being cared for at Glasgow Royal Infirmary. The 14-year-old girl had been in a serious condition but all three are now said to be stable. A 57-year-old man thought to be the driver is being treated in the Western Infirmary in the west of Glasgow and is also stable. A statement released by NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde said: 'Four patients remain in two Glasgow hospitals following Monday's tragic incident in George Square. 'Three patients remain in Glasgow Royal Infirmary: a 14-year-old girl, an 18-year-old female and a 64-year-old woman. All are stable. 'A 57-year-old man is being treated at the Western Infirmary and remains stable.' More than 600 people packed into the city's St Andrew's Cathedral for a service to remember those who died . The service was for relatives of the victims, as well as for those who witnessed the crash . The accident has led to a huge outpouring of emotion in the city, with  flowers placed near the scene . The victims of the crash were yesterday remembered at Christmas services across the city, with candles lit and prayers said for all those affected by the tragedy. Meanwhile, the festive fairground and ice rink attractions in George Square reopened yesterday as the city tried to return to normal. A spokesman for Glasgow City Council, said: 'Glasgow City Council, in co-operation with partner agencies, took the decision to reopen George Square in a phased approach which began by providing access to the nativity scene and Christmas Tree. 'It was felt right to reflect on the tragic events that unfolded and close other attractions and activities until Boxing Day, providing a chance for people to pause and pay their respects in their own way over the Christmas period.'","Nephew of Jack and Lorraine Sweeney does not blame driver for deaths .

"A man rolling a joint next to a police motorcycle and a woman taking a selfie behind the wheel are among those being shamed by authorities on social media.

In another picture, a woman can be seen taking a photo of herself as she pulls up to a roundabout. 'Top tip - Your selfie looks fab when @WAPoliceTraffic bike is filming you,' the police tweeted. In WA, the infringement if you are caught taking a selfie while driving is a $400 fine and six demerit points over the Christmas period. The photos were taken by officers wearing helmet cameras in the week leading up to Christmas, WA Today reported. WA Police have issued 324 driver distraction infringements and 19 cautions. Low visibility driving: Two chairs attached to the head of this motorcycle rider while he drives in the centre lane . Fruit packs illegally tied to the back of this ute make it impossible for this driver to see through his rear vision mirror . Roll out the brown carpet! Open double doors at the back of this van allows the load to stick out the back . The majority of notices issued were given out by unmarked motorcycles. This is not the first time police have taken to social media to shame negligent drivers. Highway Patrol in NSW regularly post photographs on their Facebook page of law-breakers taken by officers from NSW and around the world. Pictured are drivers with over-sized packages hanging from open boots, carpets rolling from the back of vans and mattresses loosely strapped to car roofs. There's even a motorcyclist wearing a chair over his helmet. Crazy photographs include trucks taking roundabouts and blocking lanes, ladders in the back of flat-bed utes that aren't tied down and back-seat passengers doubling up as safety restraints, holding on to beds attached to a car roof. The page has gone viral with more than 120,000 'fans' either send images or simply viewing the latest compilation of reckless acts. Do not overtake truck while turning: Impossible - this driver blocked a whole street when he tried to turn right, left ... who knows? Two cars transported illegally towed to the back of this truck landed the driver in hot water with police . Police have said while some of the examples are viewed as 'light-hearted fun', they can also lead to serious injury and sometimes death. Inspector Mick Timms, of NSW Police, said a motorist was killed last year when a load fell from the back of a truck at Liverpool, south west of Sydney, and crushed the driver travelling behind. He said the images are evidence that these acts are not just happening in foreign countries with lax road laws, but back home in Australia as well. 'We get sent pictures from time to time and it just shows that these acts are not just happening in other countries but here as well,' Inspector Timms said. Wide load: Piping laid across the top of this ute may have created some problems for passing motorists . Strange bedfellows: Not one, but two mattresses stacked on one another while they stick out the back of this car's boot . Mr Timms said where there is enough evidence to investigate a tip-off, police will usually take steps to prosecute drivers. But in most cases - such as the booted-up barbecue - identifying drivers can sometimes be difficult. 'The barbecue driver had no number plates, and there was no date, time or place on the image.' 'It makes it hard to track down.' He said most of the images that filter through are of trucks and large heavy vehicles with illegally stacked or restrained loads. They're potentially deadly death traps for cars, pedestrians and passing motorcycles travelling behind or past the culprits.","Police in Western Australia posted photos of driving offences to Twitter .

Cover star: Dylan Penn, 23, appears on the front cover of this month's L'Officiel Italia . Rising star: It is the second time in as many months that Dylan has appeared on the cover of a high profile fashion magazine, having featured on the front of Spanish Glamour just last month . Busy bee: The budding model revealed earlier this year that she is 'too busy' focusing on her career to look for a relationship . Since then, she has gone on to feature in several big name fashion publications, including GQ, W and Elle, as well as appearing in a risqué shoot for trendy magazine Treats, which saw her pose nude on the front cover, with just a Fendi bag to protect her modesty. At the time, the model, who reportedly turned down the chance to pose naked for Playboy revealed that, while she had some reservations about the shoot, she was 'honored' to have been asked to take part. 'I never would have guessed getting naked  would be so challenging,' Dylan told the magazine. 'It feels pretty strange. I'm honored to be on a cover of a magazine like Treats and was so excited to work with Tony Duran, that was definitely an experience I will never forget.' For her latest cover, Dylan modeled a slightly more modest look, however still managed to show off her undeniable beauty and striking features.

Earlier this month, Dylan revealed to Vogue Italia that she has inherited very different traits from both of her parents - but it is her father, two-time Oscar winner Sean, who taught her the 'passion and hunger' that have helped to make her so successful in the fashion industry. 'As a child I was very attached to my mother,' she said. 'She was always with us, and dad instead was often away on business. I started to get close to him later, when I left home. We are very similar, and I saw reflected in him everything that I hated in myself. 'Today I can recognize the values that he gave me: strong will, curiosity, passion and hunger.'

Happy families: Dylan admits that she was much closer with her mother throughout her childhood, but has recently begun bonding with her famous father . And while her determination and drive have certainly helped her to succeed in the fashion industry, she admits that she has had to sacrifice aspects of her personal life in return for her career. 'I have gone from one relationship to another because I didn't want to be alone, but now that I'm single I'm fine,' she explained. 'There is no time for love.' Ironically, it was 'love' that first catapulted Dylan into the spotlight, after she was reported to have enjoyed a brief romance with Twilight star Robert Pattinson in September 2013. However, Dylan later insisted that pair are just friends, telling Italian Vanity Fair of photographs published showing the duo together: 'They photographed us in a place where there were other people and cropped the picture. 'Silly. I laughed about it... We're just friends.'","The 23-year-old is Sean's eldest child with his ex-wife, actress Robin Wright .

"Huntsmen, horses and hounds paraded through towns and villages across the country this morning as the traditional Boxing Day hunt got underway. They were joined by huge crowds - both mounted and on foot - who were keen to show their backing for the annual event. Roughly a quarter of a million people were expected to attend the 300 hunts held today. It comes after it emerged yesterday that hunt supporters are planning to use the drive to introduce English votes for English laws to push through a repeal of the foxhunting ban after the next election.

Thousands of supporters were expected to ride out today in defiance of the ban, which was pushed through reluctantly by Tony Blair as a piece of 'red meat' to keep his backbenchers on side. In Chipping Norton, Oxfordshire, which lies in David Cameron's Witney constituency, riders of the Heythrop Hunt were greeted by hundreds of excited supporters in the town square.  Among the crowd were horse trainer Charlie Brooks, husband of former News International chief executive Rebekah. The Hunt, which has hunted four days a week since 1835, rode through land belonging to Top Gear presenter Jeremy Clarkson, just outside the village of Chadlington, Oxfordhsire.

These young riders, understood to be the next generation of the Heythrop Hunt, were among those meeting supporters in Chipping Norton . The presenter was seen standing and watching the hunt from the farm, which is just a few miles away from his family home. Around 50 huntsmen braved the cold to gather for the Zetland Hunt in North Yorkshire. Hundreds of people lined the streets of the village of Alborough St John, to see the horses and hounds as they set off on the trail around the surrounding farmland. Elsewhere, in Ledbury, Herefordshire, the Ledbury Hunt welcomed some 150 mounted followers and 5,000 well-wishers as they set off on their annual meet. David Redvers, joint-master of the  hunt, said there was 'absolute commitment' to keeping the hunt going.

'There is absolute commitment to keep the Ledbury going until repeal and support from young and old has never waned, indeed it may have increased. We are very fortunate.' The hunts took place a day after it was revealed that pro-hunting supporters are planning to use the drive to introduce English votes for English laws to push through a repeal of the 2004 Hunting Act after the next election. A Conservative pledge to hold a free vote in the Commons on scrapping the decade-old ban was quietly shelved after ministers realised it would be lost.

But campaigners claim the result will be very different if Scottish MPs, dominated by Labour, are barred from voting on the issue after next year's election. A well-placed source in the pro-hunting campaign said: 'Hunting is a classic example of the anomaly which allows Scottish MPs to dictate the law in England and Wales on an issue over which they themselves have no say in Scotland because it is a matter that has been devolved to the Scottish Parliament. 'Any move to stop MPs from Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland from voting on devolved issues in the next parliament would, therefore, make repeal or amendment of the Hunting Act in England and Wales much more likely.'

Hounds are known to have hunted the area nearby for at least 300 years . A strong showing by the SNP – whose MPs do not vote on English-only matters on principle – could have a similar effect. Research by the pro-hunting Countryside Alliance suggests that English and Welsh MPs would vote by a majority of 22 to scrap the ban if a vote were held now. The research, based on MPs' public and private indications, suggests that 292 MPs in England and Wales are in favour of repealing the law, with only 270 against. But the slim majority south of the border is heavily outweighed by overwhelming support for the ban among MPs in Scotland, where hunting was banned separately by the Scottish Parliament. The Countryside Alliance believes that Scottish MPs would vote to keep the ban by 47 votes to six. Northern Ireland's MPs are said to support repeal of the ban by eight votes to five. Supporters clamoured to snap a photograph of members of the Ledbury Hunt as they rode down Ledbury High Street earlier today . Thousands of people crowded into the centre of the market town of Ledbury today. Above, well-wishers photograph mounted huntsmen . Hounds of the Heythrop Hunt proved popular with children who had gathered in the town square of Chipping Norton, Oxfordshire . Children at the Beaufort Boxing Day hunt at Worcester Lodge in Gloucestershire lean over a fence to pet the dogs taking part in the event . The hunts took place a day after it was revealed that pro-hunting supporters are planning to use the drive to introduce English votes for English laws to push through a repeal of the 2004 Hunting Act after the next election . The figures suggest that if Scottish MPs were allowed to vote then a bid to repeal the ban would fail by a majority of 16. But, following cross-party agreement that Scotland should be handed sweeping new powers, party leaders are now under intense pressure to bar Scottish MPs from voting on purely English matters at Westminster. Labour's 2004 Hunting Act does not apply in Scotland, where hunting was banned two years earlier. A Countryside Alliance spokesman said: 'The promised vote on repeal has not materialised in this Parliament, largely because of uncertainty about the outcome, with 41 Scottish Labour MPs effectively vetoing any change in the law in England and Wales. Scotland has its own hunting legislation and there can be no justification for continuing to allow Scottish Labour MPs to perpetuate the prejudice of the Hunting Act.' The Tories are expected to repeat their pledge to hold a free vote on hunting if they win the election. But anti-hunting groups are stepping up pressure on Labour to tighten the law, amid concern at the low level of prosecutions.","Huntsmen, horses and hounds paraded through villages as 300 Boxing Day hunts got underway across the country .

"A Detroit teenager was taken off life support and died due to a gunshot wound caused by a friend playing with a handgun, police said. WJBK reports that Bernard Walker, 16, was in a home in the neighborhood of Petosky-Otsego on Christmas Day, when two friends arrived, one carrying a loaded weapon. Police say the friends started playing around with the gun in the basement, when the 19-year-old pulled the trigger, firing a shot that struck Bernard in the head. Killed: Bernard Walker, 16, was taken off life support after being struck in the head by a bullet fired by a 19-year-old friend while the two were playing around . The teen was rushed to nearby Henry Ford Hospital, where he was put on a ventilator. He was removed from life support and died Friday afternoon. The station reports that a neighbor called Bernard a 'good kid,' and his mother, Theresa Culbert, described having to watch her son slip away. 'He wasn't really doing good at all,' Culbert said. 'Just basically had to watch his brain die.' Both of Bernard's friends were taken into custody by police. Detroit Police Department spokesperson Jennifer Moreno told Detroit News police are holding the 19-year-old and will seek charges in connection to Bernard's death. Though the decision is up to the Wayne County Prosecutor’s Office, Officer Moreno said the charge would likely be manslaughter or second-degree murder. Memorialized: Friends on Twitter said that a candlelight vigil for Bernard, pictured with a classmate, will be held on Monday .

"A widow aged 83 died after the microwaveable wheat bag she was using to heat her bed set her home alight. Great-grandmother Norma Hickey was asleep when the warmer – described as the ‘modern-day water bottle’ – overheated and started smouldering under her bed linen. Fire crews called to the blaze in Wallasey Village, on the Wirral, found her dead in her first-floor bedroom. Norma Hickey, 83, died after the wheat bag she was using to warm her bed caught fire while she slept . She is believed to be the first person to die after using one of the bags in bed while sleeping. But five other people are known to have lost their lives as a result of fires caused by the warmers, which are made of cloth and filled with grains of wheat, flaxseed or corn. Last night her distraught daughter, Suzanne Healey, 59, told the Daily Mail she had no idea wheat bags could be a fire hazard. ‘I can’t believe something this small has caused such devastation,’ she said. ‘My mother had memory problems, so I did everything I could to keep her safe. I used to take all her meals round to the house as I was afraid that if she used the gas oven she’d forget to turn it off. 'I left notes on the cooker to remind her how to turn it on and off. ‘I really thought I’d covered all bases. I just wish I’d known these wheat bags could be so dangerous.’ The bags, which can be used hot or cold, are popular among the elderly who find they ease arthritis and muscular ailments. Paul Murphy, group manager  at Merseyside Fire and Rescue Service, said it appeared Mrs Hickey accidentally microwaved the bag for too long, causing it to smoulder when she took it to bed last Sunday. Neighbours called 999 after hearing smoke alarms at around 4.30am. Firemen with breathing apparatus were sent into the property. Mr Murphy added: ‘We think that the wheat bag has possibly been overheated and left within a bed, and this has caused a smouldering, smothering effect as the quilt on top of the wheat bag has caused it to continue to generate heat. The great-grandmother, who suffered from memory loss, is thought to be the first person to be killed by one of the bags while sleeping . Norma's daughter, Suzanne Healey, said she had no idea the bags could be a fire hazard . ‘It’s an awful situation and our condolences go out to the family.’ He said wheat bags must be handled with care, adding: ‘A product that absorbs and stores heat in this way is a potential fire risk if not used properly.’ Mrs Hickey was an administrator at a hospital until her retirement. Her husband John, a technician who suffered from Alzheimer’s, died 13 years ago, aged 79. The couple had two children. Mrs Healey, a mother of two who runs a tiling business, said: ‘My mother was a world traveller and was very active right up until her health began to falter. ‘She was such a gregarious and outgoing woman who was loved by so many people. She was particularly close to my sons and adored her three great-grandchildren.’ She added: ‘I hope people realise just how dangerous these microwaveable bags can be. ‘Anyone can buy them from a shop and even if they overheat just a little they can cause such devastation.’ Burned: Fire damage can be seen on the outside of Norma's bedroom windows where the blaze started . Norma's daughter says she took every precaution with her frail mother, but did not know the bags were a hazard . Fire crews have visited more than 260 properties and carried out 78 home fire safety checks around Wallasey this week following the blaze. ‘We are urging people to check on elderly neighbours in their area,’ Mr Murphy added. ‘We also ask relatives to help check the smoke alarms in older people’s homes and to make sure they have smoke alarms on each level.’ In 2010, Josephine Lloyd died after a wheat bag caught fire in her microwave in Manchester. It was thought the 79-year-old widow, who suffered from Alzheimer’s, may have added an extra zero to the heating time. West Yorkshire fire service also warned people to be careful with the bags after 82-year-old Doreen Ghiloni died when one overheated and caused a fire in her Leeds home in May 2008.","Great-grandmother Norma Hickey, 83, burned to death in her bedroom .

"Goats are known to eat just about anything, but it didn't dawn on Vince Thomas until recently that the menu might include Christmas trees. 'They'll eat the pine needles and leave the skeleton of the tree,' said Thomas, a longtime volunteer firefighter who has come up with a new use for his family-owned goat herding business, 'Goat Grazers.' 'It basically looks like Charlie Brown's Christmas with a scrawny tree that has nothing but the branches,' he told the Reno Gazette-Journal. Yummy snack: These several goats owned by Vince Thomas, founder of Goat Grazers, who along with his 40 goats are teaming up with the Truckee Meadows Fire Protection District to help recycle Christmas trees . Thomas is launching a new program with the Truckee Meadows Fire Protection District on Friday to use his 40 goats to help recycle Christmas trees. He says he got tired of watching people discard the trees in landfills or dump them on public property, where they became a fire danger. 'It was amazing to me to see how many Christmas trees people would just toss out there,' he said. Thomas said his goats have been used in the past to help graze in areas with fire-prone weeds along the Sierra's eastern front.

(AP Photo/Reno Gazette-Journal, Marcella Corona) 'We thought, ""What a great way to get rid of the weeds,""' he said. 'We had the idea of doing just that with the recycling program and we thought about the trees. 'And the goats are great employees, they love their job and they don't complain.' Thomas said he noticed not long ago that no weeds were growing at his daughter's home in Spanish Springs northeast of Reno where she raises rabbits, pigs and goats. 'It was my daughter's goats. They ate every single weed in our yard,' he said. He became curious and tossed a piece of pine tree to the goats, and they devoured it — pine needles and all. 'I did a lot of research on that, and it's OK for the goats,' Thomas said. 'With cattle and some of the other animals, it can cause miscarriages. But for goats, it's a natural dewormer, and pine is very high in vitamin C, so it's healthy for them.' Keep Truckee Meadows Beautiful is among a number of groups in the area that recycle trees and are glad to have the help from the goats. 'A lot of people dump it out on the desert and that's really a problem because people think it's a natural thing and it will decompose,' said J Merriman, communications manager for the group that has been chopping recycled trees into mulch for 24 years. 'But because we're out in the desert, they don't decompose, it will just get drier and drier and it really becomes a serious fire hazard.'

"Cleaning up fallen needles from Christmas trees is one of the most common reasons consumers don't buy real trees, the National Christmas Tree Association has said, but now scientists are on the case. Scientists in the U.S. are trying to find ways to make trees less messy and keep them fresh through the holidays. Keeping a tree well-watered goes a long way toward minimizing the needle problem. But beyond that, genetic differences of each tree can also influence how many needles it loses. Scroll down for video . Gary Chastagner, a Washington State University plant pathology professor, stands among trimmed Douglas fir trees before Christmas . Some kinds of trees, like the noble fir or Fraser fir, are better than others at maintaining moisture and keeping their needles once they're in your house, says Gary Chastagner of Washington State University. But even within a given species, some trees are better than others, he said. Needle retention is an inherited trait:  if a tree does well, so will the offspring that grow from the seeds in its cones. At a research station in Puyallup, Washington, Chastagner works to identify individual trees that hold onto their needles best. Cuttings from Douglas fir trees are suspended in water at a Washington State University research facility in Puyallup, Washington . Needles on a Canaan fir tree hold drops of water at a Washington State University research facility . He tests branches cut early in the fall, which encourages needle loss because they haven't experienced cold weather. He lets them dry out and his team evaluates them after about 10 days, looking for branches that do not shed any needles. Needles start to fall off branches from some trees within three to five days when the branch is gently rubbed, even if they aren't dry and brittle. A poor performer may lose all of them within a week. If a branch does well, it means the tree has good genetics for keeping needles. Needles cover the floor under a Douglas fir tree suspended in a temperature and humidity-controlled room at a Washington State University research facility . A needle pops off a Douglas fir tree after a researcher brushed past it in a temperature and humidity-controlled room at a Washington State University research facility . So growers can seek out seeds from those trees to produce seedlings for future planting. These progeny should do well, too. With a federal grant, Chastagner is also working with others to identify genetic markers that indicate whether a tree will resist needle shedding. That would make the tree-screening process much faster and perhaps lead to breeding experiments to produce superior trees. Trees that experience warm fall months tend to have more needle loss later, Chastagner said. So if global warming leads to warmer falls in the future, it could be bad news for Christmas trees, he said. But since his studies focus on tree branches harvested before cold fall weather sets in, they may identify trees that will do well in a warming world, he said. Chastagner emphasizes that homeowners can minimize needle shedding by keeping their displayed trees well-supplied with water. In fact, when he has set up trees for research in early December and kept them watered, some species, like noble and Nordmann fir, have gone even three months with only minimal shedding.  'The potential is phenomenal,' he said.

"Money worries and a 'Hollywood ideal' of relationships are among the reasons counselling service Relate expects a spike in calls in the new year. Some couples and families will have had a 'really difficult time' over the festive period, with so much expectation to have a great Christmas, and for some people issues 'add up and become this big pressure cooker that just explodes'. Calls to Relate's national phone line rose by 53 per cent on the first Monday of January 2014 compared with the first Monday of December 2013, with appointment bookings increasing by 86 per cent. Couples feel pressured by 'perfect' relationships depicted by Hollywood, says counsellor Priscilla Sim . Priscilla Sim, a relationships counsellor at Relate, said January is 'a time of reflection' which many see as an opportunity for a new start. 'People are thinking about their lives, their relationships, and they kind of want to go into the new year fresh and they don't want to bring in all the burdens of the past year and the past few years if the relationship hasn't been going that well. 'So I think we see quite a high volume of calls in January due to that. It's kind of like, you have three choices: You either stay as things are, you leave the relationship or you try and change. And a lot of people do opt to try and change and work things out,' she said. Ms Sim said that along with other occasions such as Valentine's Day and anniversaries, Christmas can bring a lot of expectation and pressure. 'People want to have this great family time and sometimes it's just not like that. So it can be quite difficult, with particularly money worries. 'That's like the highest concern at the moment for people that have been surveyed in Relate surveys. I think 40 per cent of people are worried about money and not being able to buy the right presents, having big arguments within families on Christmas Day. Relate received 53 per cent more  calls than the previous month from unhappy couples in January 2014 . 'The pressure on couples to provide for children, if they want to get them the latest toy that's out or the latest computer games - things are expensive. 'And inviting people round and making big dinners, all of that costs money. And that's just an extra pressure on the relationship when there's maybe stuff that's going on already for them.' Meanwhile, following the fortunes of happy celebrity couples can have a detrimental effect on our own relationships. Ms Sim said she believes the 'Hollywood ideal' of having a perfect relationship, a perfect family, and a perfect Christmas, is 'really damaging' as it causes people to question their own situations. 'I think in society, in glossy magazines and on TV, we're kind of expected to have this Hollywood ideal of relationships. 'So when they have an argument it's the end of the world, when actually research shows that arguments are healthy.  Obviously if you're arguing all the time that's difficult, but I think the ratio is one in five. 'If you're having five positive interactions to one difficult interaction you've got a healthy relationship. It's important to have arguments because that shows that you're still two individual people,' she said. Ms Sim said sometimes people think that they 'should be having sex all the time', adding: 'Unfortunately, sometimes we're just too busy, we're just tired, it does fall off the agenda. But that doesn't mean that your relationship is doomed.' The counsellor said people should recognise a healthy relationship. 'Sometimes people do panic a little bit because they're given all of these messages, from the media and  from society, that their relationship should be a certain way, when actually what they've got is really normal and actually really healthy,' she said. For 40 per cent, fears about financial insecurity and money worries are enough to destroy a marriage . Ms Sim added: 'So I think the whole idea of never arguing, never fighting, having this perfect idea of Christmas, perfect idea of a relationship, perfect idea of a family, is really damaging, because then whenever anything goes wrong, it's like, 'Well this isn't how it's supposed to be'.' Ruth Sutherland, chief executive of Relate, said: 'January is always very busy for Relate. Sadly many couples and families face a tough time over Christmas as people spend concentrated time together and that can bring any underlying issues bubbling to the surface. 'Also New Year is a time when many of us naturally assess how life is going and this can make people think about how their relationships are faring. 'The high number of calls we receive in January suggests that many people are considering what they want from their relationships and what their next steps will be. Contacting Relate is a positive step - it can be the first stage in working out what's best for your relationships.' Earlier this year, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said the number of divorces in England and Wales in 2012 was 118,140, an increase of 0.5 per cent since 2011, when there were 117,558 divorces. The number of divorces in 2012 was highest among men and women aged 40 to 44. For those married in 1972, 22 per cent of marriages had ended in divorce by their 15th wedding anniversary, whereas for those married in 1997, almost a third of marriages had ended by this time, according to the ONS. In 2012, 10.8 people divorced per thousand married population, a decrease of 19 per cent compared with 13.3 per cent in 2002. Caroline Watson, a divorce lawyer at Slater & Gordon, said: 'Any tensions or issues in a relationship are likely to come to the forefront in the lead up to New Year. 'There is a lot of pressure on families over the festive season to ensure that everything is perfect so if there are weaknesses in a relationship they can become apparent very quickly, despite the best intentions of everyone involved. 'We are often contacted by clients both as the New Year approaches and particularly after who decide that the tension and the arguing has just gone on for too long. 'The New Year is a natural time for people to assess their lives and relationships can come under more scrutiny. Especially if one has been putting in a lot more effort that the other to fix the problems in the relationship.'","January is a 'time of reflection' and an opportunity for a new start .

"A four-year-old boy with autism from New York who went missing while visiting family in South Carolina has been found dead this morning, authorities say. Coroner Robert Edge told local media outlets that Jayden Morrison was found in a pond in Little River. Emergency workers in Little River on the South Carolina coast searched for the child who went missing on Christmas Eve and was last seen wearing red footie pajamas. Area media outlets report rescue workers and volunteers searched for Jayden Morrison after he went missing from his grandmother's house at about 6 p.m. on Wednesday. Found dead: Jayden Morrison, 4, went missing from his grandmother's home in South Carolina on Christmas Eve and was found dead in a pond this morning . Mourning: The family of missing Jayden Morrison, from left, his grandmother, Carolyn Sumpter, father, Andre Morrisob and mother Tabatha Morrison pictured yesterday before Jayden was found dead . An Horry County Police dispatcher says the search resumed about 7 a.m. Thursday. The child's mother, Tabatha Morrison, tells reporters the family arrived at her mother's house on Christmas Eve day just hours earlier from New York. She said her son was autistic and wouldn't respond if his name was called. Before he was found dead, Jayden's mother said he likely would not be able to find his way home because he is not familiar with his grandmother's neighborhood. 'He’s never done anything like this before,' Morrison told the Sun News during the frantic search. 'He’s 4 years old. He’s never been out of my eyesight.' Morrison  left earlier on Christmas Eve day to go Walmart to buy toys for Christmas gifts. She decided not to bring gifts from New York because they wouldn't fit in the car. 'Mom called me at the store and said she couldn't find him,' Morrison said. Morrison said she frantically rushed back home and when she got there some emergency workers already were there. She searched the neighborhood but never found her son Jayden, she said. 'The houses here all look the same,' she said. 'At home he would be able to point out his house,' she said. Authorities previously narrowed the search to the Little River area near Highway 111 and Horseshoe Road, north of U.S. 17.

"Sixth-formers at a highly-rated secondary school were asked to discuss myths about Hitler, pictured, using a Lego kit . A fresh row over ‘dumbing down’ in the classroom has broken out after A-level students were taught about Hitler using Lego people. Sixth-formers at a highly-rated secondary school were asked to discuss myths about Hitler using a Lego kit containing figures and building blocks. The exercise involved pupils being asked questions such as ‘why is Hitler wearing a witch’s hat?’, which prompted the response ‘to show the spell that Hitler put on Germany’. The teacher responsible for the lesson at Rossett School in Harrogate posted details on his blog as an example for others to follow, leading to it being circulated widely on Twitter. An online backlash ensued on student and teacher forums, with critics branding the exercise ‘unacceptable dumbing down’. The row follows the revelation in 2013 by former Education Secretary Michael Gove that GCSE pupils were being encouraged to learn about the Nazis using Mr Men characters. He highlighted a teaching resources website – ActiveHistory - which suggested ‘depicting Hitler’s rise as a Mr Men story’. He told teachers ‘it reduces the history of Germany’s darkest years to a falling out between Mr Tickle and Mr Topsy-Turvy’. Mr Gove insisted reforms to the curriculum and exams being phased in from 2014 onwards would improve lessons. But critics claimed little had been learned from the Mr Men debacle after details emerged of the Lego lesson for A-level students. David West, the teacher who delivered the lesson, insisted it was ‘creative’ and ‘memorable’ while not compromising on ‘depth and detail’. He said it had produced ‘high quality’ work that was ‘better than it would have been’ had the lesson followed its usual course. The lesson, which took place during the autumn term, used a StoryStarter kit produced by Lego Education for pupils in key stages one and two – ages four to 11. It contained assorted characters, animals accessories and basic bricks. Pupils were required to investigate the personality cult created around Hitler by Nazi propagandist Joseph Goebbels using Lego scenes. The lesson, which took place during the autumn term, used a StoryStarter kit produced by Lego Education for pupils in key stages one and two – ages four to 11 . On his blog, Mr West recalled: ‘The students were really engaged on the task and produced very creative solutions. ‘“Why is Hitler wearing a witches hat?” “To show the spell that Hitler put on Germany.” ‘“Why is Hitler waving to a cat?” “He is giving up his personal happiness to devote himself to the nation.” ‘“Why is the spider laid like that?” “He is giving the Nazis salute showing how devoted all his people were”.’ But one critic on the Student Room website said they were ‘most concerned by the embarrassingly low demand of the task’ and the ‘laughably shallow’ level of analysis required. Another wrote: ‘I think creative teaching methods are great but if this – “Why is Hitler wearing a witch’s hat?” “To show the spell that Hitler put on Germany” - is the quality of analysis your AS students are producing then I’d say that’s a problem.’ There was further criticism from fellow teachers on the TES forum, with one dismissing the lesson as ‘anti-intellectual nonsense’. One said: ‘I don’t believe such a lightweight exercise delivered through such as trivial, jokey medium would prompt any serious thought or insight into Hitler or propaganda.’ Another mocked Mr West’s ‘fancy’ title - Leadership Secondment for Learning Experience – and said it was ‘worrying’ that he believed ‘getting 6th formers to play with lego is a valid teaching strategy’. The teacher responsible for the lesson at Rossett School in Harrogate, pictured, posted details on his blog as an example for others to follow . And they said: ‘I encounter a lot of younger colleagues who appear to believe that a productive lesson somehow involves entertainment. It’s an attitude usually accompanied by the almost constant use of the words guys and bud.’ Following the backlash, Mr West wrote a follow-up blog describing his experience of being ‘panned’ on the internet and complaining about ‘incredibly negative and offensive posts’. ‘Having discussed this with my colleagues, and with several of my sixth form students, I have been struck by support I have received,’ he said. ‘Several students have spoken to me about how much they got out of the lesson and how it has helped them think about the topic of propaganda. ‘I realise how lucky I am to work where I do. ‘In the face of this abuse I have had to be resilient, it would have been easy to delete my blog, it would be easy to stop sharing my work, it would be easy to stop innovating, it would be easy to keep my head down and let the bullies win.’ But he said ‘there is absolutely no way that I will stop trying to innovate’. The school where he works has been rated ‘outstanding’ by Ofsted. There is debate in some quarters, however, over the extent to which the watchdog is dismissive of traditional teaching and welcoming of practices such as ‘independent learning’, group work and bite-size activities. Sir Michael Wilshaw, the chief inspector, said he was ‘enraged’ by claims made in a report in March 2014 that some inspectors prefer certain teaching styles. However he insisted it was incorrect to suggest that Ofsted was ‘full of lefty, hippy types’.","Sixth-formers at highly-rated school discussed Hitler using Lego kit .

"A man who allegedly sparked a Christmas Day siege on the Gold Coast has appeared in court on charges of attempted murder and keeping a rabbit. Anthony Shane Randall, 36, was arrested on Christmas morning after a lengthy stand-off with police during which he allegedly fired gunshots in Southport. Randall came to the attention of police on Christmas Eve when he was involved in a dispute and allegedly ordered another man into a car against his will. During the argument, a first gunshot was allegedly fired. He then fled to a nearby unit complex on White Street and allegedly fired another shot when police negotiators and specialist officers surrounded the building. The siege came to a head about 11am local time on Thursday when Randall surrendered. Scroll down for video . Anthony Shane Randall, 36, was arrested on Christmas morning after a lengthy stand-off with police . Weapon: This is the shotgun the Gold Coast gunman used during today's siege . He appeared in the Southport Magistrates Court on Friday morning, charged with attempted murder, assault occasioning bodily harm, unlawful possession of a weapon and deprivation of liberty. Randall also had more charges added to his list prior to the appearance, including going armed so as to cause fear, possessing explosives, and keeping a declared pest (a rabbit). He did not seek bail and his case was adjourned until January 9. Camouflaged specialist police officers have been pictured near the siege site . Anthony Shane Randall, 36, was charged with attempted murder, assault occasioning bodily harm, and unlawful possession of a weapon . The dramatic events began when officers were called to a disturbance on Anne St, Southport, around 11pm last night. He then retreated to the unit where he remained for 12 hours. Authorities initially feared other people were inside the unit, although they now believe he was alone. Police deployed a black Bearcat armoured police vehicle and a squad of camouflaged troopers. The man's surrender followed tense telephone negotiations with officers. Inspector Bruce Kuhn told reporters earlier that police were concerned by the man's gunshots. A large Bearcat armoured police vehicle is present at the unit complex . Train and light rail services were also suspended and traffic diverted from the area. In a statement, Queensland police said they were aware the incident might disrupt some people's festivities. 'While police understand that many people will soon be wishing to leave their homes and make their way to Christmas festivities, for their own safety, they are requested to stay inside until advised otherwise,' a spokesman said.

"Igor Baksht planned to give his 13-year-old niece a PlayStation 4 for Christmas, so he went to a Stapleton Walmart last Friday to buy one. The employee who assisted him at the store took the gaming console out of a locked cabinet and told him it was previously returned, Baksht told WPTV. The associate mentioned to him the box felt heavy, but at the time Baksht felt there was nothing strange about that since he'd never bought one before and wouldn't know how much it weighs. Scroll down for video . Scammed: Instead of a PlayStation 4, Igor Baksht told KMGH he found two bags filled with small rocks that had been duct taped closed in a gift he planned to give his niece . It wasn't until he was getting ready to wrap the gift when he opened the box. 'Just to make sure everything was inside, that all the contents were inside, all the games were inside,' he said. 'When I opened it, I said, ""Oh my God.""' Instead of the console, inside the box were two bags filled with small rocks that had been duct taped closed. The original store was closed by then, and Baksht was also turned away at a 24-hour Walmart. He returned to the store he purchased the rock-filled box from Saturday morning. 'He said they cannot do anything about it because they don't have proof, how it came in, nothing,' Baksht said about trying to return the console, which starts at $399 at the retail chain. 'I never stole anything in my life. The most criminal thing that I've did, I got a driving ticket,' he added. Stuck: Baksht says he tried to return the console for an exchange or a refund, but was told Walmart couldn't verify they had sold him the rocks . Deceptive: The sales associate that retrieved the PlayStation bundle for Baksht said it felt heavy, but the man didn't question what he thought was the console's normal weight . He tried to call the story and Walmart's corporate office, to no avail. Then on Christmas Eve, he caught a break when a store manager phoned him, saying he could bring the box back to the store and refunded the money Baksht paid. A spokesperson for Walmart told 7NEWS there was no way to verify the man's story, but they wanted to give him the benefit of the doubt. Baksht joked that if he hadn't checked the box before wrapping it, there would have been some tears, from both himself and his niece. Technology-related Christmas scams happen nearly every year, with criminals exhibiting varying degrees of creativity. In 2005, one boy who thought he was getting an iPod video instead unwrapped a sealed piece of mystery meat in an Apple box, ABC reported.","Igor Baksht was giving his 13-year-old niece a PlayStation 4 bybdke for Christmas .

"At the height of the Cold War, former Labour cabinet minister Tony Benn was considered by the Soviet Union an 'unnecessary simpleton' who was too stupid to recruit as an agent,  a KGB defector has claimed. Oleg Gordievsky, who was tasked with spying for the KGB while posted in London as a resident designate in the 1980s, warned his colleagues that if elected deputy-leader of the Labour party, Benn would ruin the Cold War political balance. Although tasked with running a Soviet intelligence operation from London, Mr Gordievsky had in fact worked for MI6 since 1974. Scroll down for video . Soviet defector Oleg Gordievsky (pictured) claims the Russians considered Benn too 'simple' to recruit . This led to him being named a Companion of the Most Distinguished Order in the 2007 Queen's Birthday Honours for his assistance to British national security. But in an interview with The Telegraph, Mr Gordievsky has now claimed Benn was ignored by Soviet diplomats as a potential source because he was unreliable and made false claims. During a 1983 meeting with Soviet ambassador Viktor Popov, Mr Gordievsky was told to be aware of Benn who was considered 'not truthful'. Mr Gordievsky said: 'He was an unnecessary simpleton, who told left-wing fairytales and falsified stories.' He added that two years earlier he had prevented Soviet intelligence officials from supporting Benn in the Labour leadership contest and sent memos to Moscow warning it would be 'catastrophic' for Europe's political balance if Benn was elected. Tony Benn (right) poses for a photo with Soviet Union leader Alexei Kosygin, during the Russian leader's 1967 visit to Britain . Benn's guest appearance at the 1984 Militant Tendency rally (pictured) was considered a blunder that severely damaged his chances of a place on the shadow cabinet . Benn died in March at the age of 88. He was described as the 'most dangerous man in Britain' in the 1980s, but was voted the UK's 'political hero' by viewers of the BBC's Daily Politics programme in 2007. He joined the Labour Party in 1943, and became an MP seven years later, winning the Bristol South-East by-election after the death of Sir Stafford Cripps in 1950. Fairly moderate at the start, Benn's political views became more extreme to the left as his career progressed, until, by the time he retired in 2001 'to devote more time to politics', he was one of the most radical politicians in his party. He put forward the Commonwealth of Britain Bill to abolish the monarchy in 1992. In later life, Benn was appointed President of Stop the War Coalition and campaigned vigorously against the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.

"After a month of threats from hackers that nearly derailed its release and almost brought Sony Pictures to its knees, the long-awaiting opening of The Interview on Christmas Day became a major event with packed crowds flocking to not only see the movie but also champion freedom of expression. Sold out crowds turned out around the country, helping the movie earn a staggering $1million on opening day, and making it now on track to earn $4million this holiday weekend. And for some theatergoers seeing the film became a very patriotic moment, like the crowd at The Plaza Theater in Atlanta, Georgia who got to their feet to sing God Bless America before the picture started. The 1942 rendition of the classic song  as performed by Kate Smith will be played before each screening at that theater. 'This is way more fun than it would have been,' said Jim Kelley of Atlanta, who waited outside with his daughter, Shannon. The elder Kelley added, with mocking sarcasm, 'This is almost dangerous, like we're living life on the edge.' Scroll down for videos .

People wait in line on Christmas day to watch the first screening of the controversial movie The Interview at the Plaza Theatre in Atlanta, Georgia . A movie goer heads to her seat at West End Cinema, one of just a few theaters showing The Interview  in Washington, DC . Sony Pictures had initially called off the release after major theater chains dropped the movie that was to have opened on as many as 3,000 screens. But with President Obama among others criticizing the decision, Sony officials changed their minds and independent theaters agreed to release it in over 300 venues on Christmas Day. 'We are taking a stand for freedom,' said theater manager Lee Peterson of the Cinema Village East in Manhattan, where most of Thursday's seven screenings had sold out by early afternoon. 'We want to show the world that Americans will not be told what we can or cannot watch. Personally, I am not afraid.' 'It was more serious, the satire, than I was expecting,' said Simone Reynolds, who saw the film while visiting from London. 'There's a message for America in there too about America's foreign policy.' Ken Jacowitz, a 54-year-old librarian from the New York borough of Queens, called it 'a funny film made by funny people.' He had a message for North Korea and the hackers: 'You have given this movie whole new lives.' In Little Rock, members of an Arkansas family who say they otherwise would have never seen The Interview were among the first patrons at the Riverdale 10 theater. Kay Trice and her husband drove an hour from Stuttgart, Arkansas, to see the movie with their daughter and appreciated 'the freedom to see it.' 'It should be shown in this country and somebody in North Korea should not have the right to scare us out of seeing this,' Trice said.

Co-directors Evan Goldberg and Seth Rogen, who also co-stars in the low-brow comedy with James Franco, surprised moviegoers by appearing at the sold-out 12:30 a.m. PT (0330 ET) screening of the movie at a theater in Los Angeles, where they briefly thanked fans for their support. A few dozen people lined up early outside Tempe, Arizona's Valley Art theater, where tickets for all five showings on Thursday had sold out. 'There are a lot of people going crazy over (the controversy). It's bigger than the movie,' said Omar Khiel, 20. At the Cinema Village theater in Manhattan, the 10 a.m. screening was near capacity. Derek Karpel, a 34-year-old attorney, said that 'as many people as possible should go see it. In fact, the government should subsidize tickets to make that possible.' But he wasn't about to call The Interview a national treasure. 'No one should go into expecting it to be a serious commentary on politics,' he said. 'But it's fun. People should go.' The Interview also made history by becoming made available on a variety of digital platforms on Wednesday afternoon, including Google Play, YouTube Movies, Microsoft's Xbox Video and a separate Sony website. A Sony spokeswoman on Thursday said she had no figures on the number of downloads so far, and the studio was not expected to have box office numbers from theaters before Friday morning.

'The Interview,' the comedy starring Seth Rogen and James Franco, was listed under an American flag on the marquee of the Cinefamily at Silent Movie Theater in Los Angeles . The back story of The Interview has itself played out like a Hollywood satire, in which a cartoonish farce distracts from some of the holiday season's most prestigious films: Selma, the drama about the 1965 civil rights march; Angelina Jolie's adaptation of the best-selling World War II story Unbroken; and the all-star, big-screen version of Stephen Sondheim's Into the Woods. Security was light at many theaters, with the occasional police officer on hand. The possibility of violence was taken more seriously by the movie industry than by government officials. Last week, the Department of Homeland Security released a statement saying that there were no credible threats. Meanwhile, Darrell Foxworth, a special agent for the FBI in San Diego, said on Wednesday the agency was sharing information with independent movie theater owners showing The Interview out of 'an abundance of caution' and to educate them about cyber threats and what help the FBI can offer. Kim Song, a North Korean diplomat to the United Nations, condemned the release on Wednesday, calling the movie an 'unpardonable mockery of our sovereignty and dignity of our supreme leader.' But Kim said North Korea will likely limit its response to condemnation, with no 'physical reaction.' Decisions to show the movie through the internet could open up companies to hacking. Xbox and PlayStation's online gaming services were down on Thursday afternoon but the cause was unclear. A hacking group called the Lizard Squad claimed it was behind disruptions at both Xbox and Sony Corp's PlayStation Networks, which was not carrying 'The Interview.' Neither Microsoft nor Sony offered explanations for the connectivity problems, though both services expected heavy use as consumers who received the devices for Christmas tried to log on all at once. Extra network traffic on Xbox from users downloading The Interview may also have exacerbated connectivity problems for Microsoft. Meanwhile, YouTube and other Google products were not having any disruptions.

"A Pennsylvania couple have had a Christmas they will never forget. Mother-of-two Courtney Stash, 25, was not due until February, but had been in the hospital since December 20 experiencing labor pains. But at 10.30am Thursday, her babies were ready to come into the world. Identical twin girls Claire and Avaree were born via cesarean, along with brother Eoin. Welcome to the world: Little Eoin and his two twin sisters were born on Christmas Day at Hershey Medical Center. Eoin needed a breathing apparatus for the first 24 hours because of some fluid in his lungs . Intensive care: The babies - pictured here is Claire - remain in the neonatal intensive care unit . Precious: The triplets will be released from the unit once they can regulate their own blood sugars and body temperatures . They weighed 3 pounds 8 ounces, 3 pounds 10 ounces and 4 pounds 4 ounces, respectively, Penn Live reported. The twins were born without any real issues, however Eoin had some fluid in his lungs. Doctors removed the machine that was helping him breath on Friday, allowing the boy's father, Justin Dwyer, 26, to see his son for the first time. 'I was about to cry,' Dwyer told Penn Live. 'It was the first time I saw his face without the mask and all the tubes. He was so cute.' Happy parents: Justin Dwyer said he fell in love with his partner, Courtney Stash, because of her calmness . Big family: The couple are now raising five children, with Stash already having two from a previous relationship . The babies remain in the the neonatal intensive care unit at Hershey Medical Center, but will be released once they can regulate their own blood sugars and body temperatures. Dwyer, a dairy farmer, admitted to being somewhat worried when the ultrasound showed they were having three children. However he said Stash was fine with the news, adding that her calmness in the face of anything is why he fell in love with her.

"The future of the BBC licence fee has been thrown into doubt as it emerged that less than half of Britons think that it is good value for money. New figures reveal that just 44 per cent of viewers think that the £145.50 annual charge is the best way to fund the public broadcaster, with others supporting advertising or voluntary subscriptions. The findings come after it was found that a dwindling number of television sets in Britain and a growing number of online-TV viewers could also threatening the future of the licence fee. Dwindling support: New figures reveal that just 44 per cent of viewers think that the £145.50 annual charge is the best way to fund offerings such as Strictly Come Dancing, above, from the public broadcaster . The latest poll, conducted by YouGov for the Times, found that there had been a 4 per cent drop in the number of viewers who thought the licence fee was good value for money. Though the licence fee is the favoured single method as a means to support the Corporation, 45 per cent would prefer an alternative means of funding. Of those, 25 per cent would support the introduction of advertising as a form of revenue, while 13 per cent thought voluntary subscriptions would be effective. A combination of the two alternative methods garnered just 7 per cent of the votes. And 11 per cent of respondents said that they did not know how the Corporation should be funded. It comes after it emerged last month that children watch half the amount of TV as their parents. Youngsters between the age of 11 and 15 spend six times longer watching internet video clips as older viewers, but spend much less time in front of traditional sets, an Ofcom survey found. Threat to the future: Children spend less time watching TV than older viewers. (File image) Because the licence fee only applies to those who watch or record TV and not to those who watch up catch-up shows or other internet content, many future adults may be exempt. The problem is compounded by the fact that there are also fewer television sets in the UK for the first time ever. In the report published this month, Ofcom highlighted BBC figures revealing that in July this year, 47 per cent of people accessing iPlayer were doing so through tablets or mobiles, an increase from just 25 per cent in October 2012. The report said there are now approximately 900,000 households with access to the internet but no television set and so rely on internet services to watch programmes. On average, people in the UK watch four hours of television a day, with ‘linear viewing’ – meaning watching show at the time when it is broadcast – still being the most popular way of consuming television. Although the level of television viewing dropped by 4 per cent in 2013, Ofcom has said it is ‘not yet clear whether this was the beginning of a longer-term trend or merely a temporary variation.’ The BBC told MailOnline: 'At just £2.80 a week per household the BBC provides excellent value for money. It means that programmes like EastEnders, Strictly, Sherlock, Doctor Who and Match of the Day can be watched by everyone, not a select few, along with our radio stations, news, iPlayer and our website. 'Public support for the licence fee has risen since 2004 and remains the most popular way of funding the BBC - indeed, another YouGov poll for The Times earlier in December showed 51% support for the licence fee.'","Just 44 per cent of poll respondents agreed licence fee was good value .

"As countries in the Indo-Pacific prepare to commemorate the 10th anniversary of the devastating Boxing Day tsunami, survivors are gathering all over the region to remember the tragedy that a decade ago left an estimated 230,000 people dead. When the disaster struck Australia pledged $1 billion in humanitarian funds and played a key role helping with the overwhelming task of identifying thousands of victims. The tsunami was triggered by a 9.1-magnitude earthquake, which struck off the west coast of Sumatra, Indonesia, and hit coastal communities across the Indian Ocean. The main commemoration ceremonies are planned in Thailand and Indonesia where the worst death and destruction took place. Twenty-six Australians were among the more than 5,000 people killed when the tsunami hit Thailand. Thais and foreigners place flowers and personal items on the memorial tiles with the victims names, to remember their lost loved ones, at the wave shaped tunnel that forms the Tsunami Memorial Park .

Seconds later, he is dead, and the wave destroys everything in its path. 'I saw people walk down to the water and start filming,' he said. 'I saw the line of [the] wave and it was coming to the beach. I still had time to warn people to come up. I was trying to shout – I shouted, 'Get out, get out'.'

"Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush is resigning from the board of a health care company that has profited from Obamacare following his decision to 'actively explore' a presidential campaign. Effective Dec. 31, Bush will no longer be employed by Tenet Healthcare or multinational financial services firm Barclays as disentangles himself from business interests that could cause conflicts if he declares his candidacy, as expected, for the 2016 competition. He has also stopped booking paid speeches, though he will follow through on previous commitments through early next year. Bush's spokeswoman Kristy Campbell told the Los Angeles Times that the former chief executive of Florida is 'reviewing all his engagements and his business commitments' as he makes the transition from businessman to politician, again. 'That’s a natural next step,' she said, referring to his 2016 considerations. Scroll down for video . Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush is pictured here earlier this month speaking at the U.S. Cuba Democracy PAC's 11th Annual Luncheon in Coral Gables, Florida. Bush, who announced plans in mid-December to 'actively explore' running for president, will book no new paid speaking engagements until he's made a decision a spokesperson has said . Bush made official last week his interest in holding the office once held by both his father, George H.W. Bush, and brother, George W. Bush, a former governor himself. While he's maintained that he's merely considering a foray into the Republican presidential primary, his divestment of Tenet and Barclays suggests otherwise. The 61-year-old remains a partner in three private equity funds, including one offshore investment fund that is located in the United Kingdom and benefits an aviation services firm based in Hong Kong, that have raised a combined $127 million, according to the LA Times. Another supports a Denver-based firm that invests in hydraulic fracking in Pennsylvania and New York, while the other props up a Marshall Islands business that transports propane. Bush's work in the business world dates back to '80s when he moved to Miami, Florida, and worked his way up to partner in a real estate development firm. He then served as Commerce Secretary in the Sunshine State for two years before resigning to join his father's re-election campaign. After his father's loss Bush decided to stay in politics, first as a campaign manager for Republican Ileana Ros-Lehtinen and later as a candidate himself. He failed at his first attempt to be elected to public office but succeeded at winning the governor's mansion on his second try in 1998. Two consecutive terms as governor later, Bush reentered the private sector in 2007 and joined the boards of Lehman Brothers, which was later absorbed in part by Barclays after the 2008 financial crash, Swisher Hygiene, InnoVida, Rayonier and Tenet. Building materials manufacturing company InnoVida went bankrupt in 2011 after the business' president defrauded investors, pocketing millions. He was found guilty of $40 million in investment fraud and sentenced to 121 1/2 years in prison. For his work with InnoVida, which he left in 2010, Bush received $468,901, but he paid $270,000 to a bankruptcy court as part of the company's settlement, the LA Times reports. Bush has since parted ways with Swisher Hygiene, as well. A once profitable sanitation company, its stocks took a dive in 2011 after an acquisitions spree and it never fully recovered. On Rayonier's website Bush is still listed as a member of its board of directors - a gig that pays $200,000. At the time of his resignation from Barclays Bush's compensation reportedly topped $1 million. Between direct payments and stock sales Bush also made close to $1.4 million in 2013 off of Tenet. Tenet was a major proponent of Obamacare and the hospital chain reaped significant profits from the individual mandate portion of the law that requires all Americans to sign up for health care, regardless of whether their employer provides it or not. The company's chief operating officer, Trevor Fetter, said in August that its second quarter performance this year is 'the best' he can remember since joining the company nearly two decades ago, per a report from Forbes, and credited a third of the growth to the Obamacare-fueled health care sign ups. Earlier this year he predicted that Obamacare would put the company up $100 million in earnings in 2014. Bush has said that Obamacare is 'flawed to its core' and 'doesn't work' while calling on Republicans to allow it to implode 'a little more organically.' He added, 'I think the best way to repeal ObamaCare is to have an alternative. We never hear the alternative. 'We could do this in a much lower cost with improved quality based on our principles, free market principles,' he said in an interview on ABC's This Week that aired last year. Tenet's chief executive, Fetter, told the New York Times in April that Bush had been vocal in his opposition to the Affordable Care Act while advising the company but suggested that he did not let his political views get in the way of his duties. He was able to separate his 'personal views and what is best for the company,' Fetter said. Bush's spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment on the nature of Bush's work with the company. In this November 1998 photo then Florida Governor-Elect Jeb Bush, left, laughs during a joint news conference in New Orleans with his brother, then-Texas Gov. George W. Bush. Since leaving office in 2007, Jeb has made millions by giving paid speeches and advising buisinesses . As Bush distances himself from Tenet, it has already cozied up to another likely 2016 presidential candidate that takes a more favorable approach to the health care reform law: Hillary Clinton. Two weeks ago the health care organization announced its sponsorship of an Indian Wells, California, meeting of the Bill, Hillary and Chelsea Clinton Foundation near Palm Springs. The company's president will even introduce Bill Clinton at a plenary session of the Jan. 26 Clinton Health Matters Activation Summit, reports Forbes. Despite her rumored candidacy for president, Hillary Clinton will continue her work with her family's non-profit and is slated to make paid appearances until at least February of next year. In the nearly two years since leaving the Obama administration Clinton is known to have racked up a nest egg of more than $5 million from speaking fees, a large chunk of which has come from the financial services industry. For his speeches, of which he has given on more than 100 occasions in the last eight years, Bush received roughly $50,00 an appearance, earning him undisclosed millions. An unknown number of those appearances were unpaid, however. As of last spring, Bush had also earned at least $3.2 million in board payments and stock grants, per an analysis by the New York Times, since leaving public office. Bush's previous business dealings will certainly come up in the presidential race should he proceed with his candidacy, and his relationship with Tenet is already being called his 'Obamacare problem.' But Al Cardenas, the former chairman of the American Conservative Union who headed the Florida GOP at the time that Bush was in office, told the LA Times this week that he didn't think Bush's business associations would ultimately blemish his candidacy. 'I think he’s always been an honest man in business and in politics,' Cardenas said. 'He’s comfortable with his actions and what he’s done. All the public wants to know is that you behaved honorably and that you care for them.' In 2016 polling Bush has consistently stayed at the front of a pack of presumed Republican candidates along with Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, as well as 2012 presidential nominee Mitt Romney, who has said repeatedly that he's not running. The four men received 14 percent (Romney), 12 percent (Bush), 10 percent (Paul) and eight percent (Christie) of the vote in a Zogby poll released on Wednesday, beating out 11 other potential candidates.","Effective Dec. 31, Bush will no longer be employed by Tenet Healthcare or multinational financial services firm Barclays .

"For more than half a century, D-Day and the military invasion known as Operation Overlord have been synonymous with the Allied victory in the Second World War. But new never-before-seen documents have revealed the codenames for these campaigns were changed almost three weeks before the invasion of Nazi-occupied France. The top secret documents - discovered among the possessions of a late Army officer involved in the planning of D-Day - were discovered when the officer's son presented his father's belongings to an expert on Antiques Roadshow. The urgent memo was sent to senior officers on May 19, 1944, 18 days before the June 6 raid, stating: 'Overlord should be swapped for Hornpipe and D-Day should be referred to as Halcyon.' The documents (pictured) show senior officers were briefed to use three replacement code names of 'Hornpipe', 'Halcyon' and 'Ripcord' The documents were discovered by Richard Wheeler when he cleaned out his parents' home in 1999 and found his father Sam 'Moses' Wheeler (left) had kept the secret documents. Pictured on the right is an illustration of Major Wheeler taken from a book about men who served in the Second World War . The memo also said the codename 'Ripcord' should be used to signal a 24-delay to the operation. The last-minute change came following concerns the original codenames had been compromised when many of them, including Overlord, appeared in crosswords in a national newspaper. The Allied high command had referred to the the planned mass invasion of occupied France by the codename Overlord ever since it was conceived in 1943. The remarkable development was discovered when Richard Wheeler was clearing out his late father Major Sam Wheeler's house and stumbled upon the documents. Major Wheeler had helped plan the logistics for D-Day, which was masterminded by Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery, and had somehow ended up keeping the papers, stamped 'top secret'. Mr Wheeler took them to show experts at the BBC's Antiques Roadshow at Durham Cathedral - and they were left stunned when he explained what they were. Mr Wheeler, 67, from Durham, said: 'My father joined the army at the outbreak of war and worked his way up through the ranks, eventually joining the 21st Army Group in 1944. 'They were based at the army's headquarters in London and was responsible for the planning of the D-Day invasions. 'My father was involved in the logistics of the invasion and so would have been close to these messages being passed back and forward. Labelled 'top secret', the files (pictured) were kept by Major Sam Wheeler, who was involved in planning the logistics of D-Day, or as it was later called, Halcyon . The documents (pictured) also stated the term 'Ripcord' should be used for a 24-hour delay to the invasion . 'It was only when I was clearing out my parents' house following the death of my mother in 1999 that I found these documents. 'I showed a few of my friends but no-one thought much of them. 'When I heard the Antiques Roadshow was coming to Durham I thought I would take them along and that's when people started getting excited about them. 'It's amazing to think I have had them for all these years and my father had them before me.' Paul Atterbury, an expert on Antiques Roadshow, said: 'D-Day is such a well-documented moment in time that I was amazed that something new could come out of it. 'I was very intrigued when these documents were brought onto the Antiques Roadshow. They seem to suggest there was a different set of codewords used briefly in the run-up to D-Day. 'Our interpretation of what happened is that because of security fears a new layer of codewords were introduced. 'There was a risk that the Overlord codename had been compromised. There's a well-known story of how Overlord and many other codenames appeared in a newspaper crosswords which aroused suspicion. Expert Paul Atterbury (left) and Richard Wheeler (right) discuss the remarkable discovery during the filming of Antiques Roadshow . 'The documents make it very clear these are replacement codewords for the established ones in use. 'They say Overlord would have to be replaced with Hornpipe and D-Day replaced by Halcyon. There was also a new codeword for 'delay', which was Ripcord. 'The documents were issued on May 19 1944 and we think they went into use very quickly. Because D-Day was a success the replacement codenames were then abandoned and everyone went back to Overlord and D-Day. 'The new codenames would only have been used by the very high echelons of officers. They were afraid the Germans might have picked up the existing codewords and know that something was about to happen. 'New codewords were quickly conceived and circulated on a need-to-know basis. The documents we saw definitely had signals sent that incorporated these words. 'These documents may exist in the national archives but no-one has ever drawn attention to them. 'They are completely genuine and come from a very clear source with links to Montgomery's office. 'None of the many books published about D-Day mention these codewords and as far as we know this story has never been told before. These documents could change history.' The story will feature on the Antiques Roadshow on December 28.","Officers ordered D-Day and Overlord to be renamed Halcyon and Hornpipe .

"Four new possible suspects in the brutal killings of three boy scouts in Arkansas in 1993 have been named by attorneys in the case - and the stepfather of one of the boys is among them. Terry Hobbs, the stepfather of eight-year-old victim Stevie Branch, has been named in documents released in Marian, Arkansas by the attorneys for Pam Hobbs, Stevie's mother. The new documents claim that Hobbs and three other men killed Stevie and two of his friends after they caught the boys spying on them while they were taking drugs. The bodies of Stevie, Michael Moore and Christopher Byers, all eight years old, were found naked, tied with their shoelaces and mutilated in a ditch in West Memphis, Arkansas in May 1993. Scroll down for video . Murdered: New possible suspects have been named in the killings of Christopher Byers, left, James Michael Moore, centre, and Steven Branch, right, who were found tied up and mutilated in 1993 . Three local teenagers who became known as the 'West Memphis Three', Damien Echols, Jessie Misskelley Jr. and . Jason Baldwin, were convicted of the murders and sentenced to death but staunchly maintained their innocence. After the case garnered national and celebrity attention, the three were freed in 2011 after agreeing . to an Alford plea, allowing them to maintain their innocence while . pleading guilty. Pam Hobbs has said she does not believe the three men who were originally convicted for the crimes were guilty of murdering her son and his friends. On Wednesday, a hearing was held to allow her and the other parents of the victims to see the evidence of the case; during this hearing, attorneys filed a motion to name four further suspects. Accused: A witness now claims that Stevie's stepfather Terry Hobbs, left, and his friend David Jacoby, right, killed them along with two teenagers after they caught the boys spying on them taking drugs . 'Killers': The witness said that Buddy Lucas, left, told a witness he was at the scene with Hobbs, Jacoby and another teenager LG Hollingsworth, right. He said he saw Hobbs stab the boys . On the list were Terry Hobbs and his friend David Jacoby as well as two men who would have been teenagers at the time: LG Hollingsworth and Buddy Lucas, WREG reported. Their names have emerged after a witness stepped forward to claim that Buddy Lucas told him he had been part of the murders, years after they had taken place. The witness said he learned that Hobbs and Jacoby invited the two teenagers to meet with them to buy drugs. When the men were smoking pot, they saw the three boys spying on them, he said. Jacoby grabbed one of the boys and . beat him while Hobbs ordered Lucas and Hollingsworth to grab . and hold the other two boys, according to the affidavit. Anger: Mark Byers, step-father of murder victim Christopher Byers talks to media following the hearing on Wednesday into whether family members can see the evidence in the case .

"A partially blind dog has survived a fall from the balcony outside his owner's downtown Sacramento condominium by landing in a hot tub 15 stories below. The Sacramento Bee reported Wednesday that the 13-year-old Boston terrier, named Sammy, was dog-paddling in the hot tub when workers went to investigate the cause of a giant splash they heard this. His owner's mother watches Sam during the day and tells The Bee that at first she assumed the dog had taken the stairs down, but then realized he couldn't have gotten out of the condo without slipping through the balcony's railing. The fall occurred at the Bridgeway Towers apartment block, which is one of the tallest buildings in Sacramento.

"Free: Jon Venables, one of James Bulger's killers, has been secretly released from prison . Jon Venables - one of the child killers of James Bulger - has been secretly freed from prison, it was revealed today. The 31-year-old, who was released from his life sentence for the brutal murder of the toddler in 2001, was locked up again three years ago after being caught with child porn on his computer. But it has been claimed today that he was released last week and given a fourth new identity - with the cost of protecting Venables believed to have passed £1million. The Sun reports that James's family was only informed of Venables' release yesterday. Mother Denise Fergus, who has campaigned widely since the death of her son, was said to be 'shocked'. She told the paper: 'I have been told that the terms of his parole mean that he must not enter Merseyside. But the probation service didn't monitor him properly last time so I have no faith in their ability to do that now. 'They should've kept him locked up for a long time.' James's father Ralph is convinced that Venables will re-offend, a fried of his told The Sun, adding that the family had not been given updates on the plans to release the killer. 'As ever they are kept in the dark,' the friend said. 'They don't explain the terms of his release, I don't know whether they are going to.' Scroll down for video . Anger: Mother Denise Fergus, who has campaigned widely since the death of her son, was said to be 'shocked' after only learning of the release yesterday . Killers: Venables and classmate Robert Thompson, right, . were ten when they abducted two-year-old James, left, from a shopping centre in . Bootle, Merseyside . This year marks the 20th anniversary of James’s murder. Venables . and classmate Robert Thompson were 10 when they abducted the . two-year-old from a shopping centre in Bootle, Merseyside, in February . 1993, and tortured and murdered him. They were given life sentences for the crime, but released on licence in 2001 with new identities, despite public opposition. The terms of Venables’s parole banned . him from entering Merseyside, but it emerged that he had flouted the . terms by attending soccer matches and nightclubs in Liverpool. Chilling: CCTV footage showed Venebles and Robert Thompson leading young Jamie away by the hand in a Bootle shopping centre . Jon Venables was first released from prison in 2001, at the age of 18, and given a new identity to protect him from the risk of vigilante attacks. At the time, a psychiatrist ruled that he did not pose a danger to the public and was extremely unlikely to commit any further offences. However, he developed drinking and drugs problems, and he compromised his identity at least twice by telling friends he was a convicted murderer. When a probation officer visited his home in Cheshire to discuss his fears that he could be in danger, he was attempting to destroy the hard drive of his computer. The hard drive was later examined by police, who discovered that it contained dozens of indecent images of children. Venables admitted that he had posed online as a 35-year-old woman who had abused her eight-year-old daughter, and was returned to prison. During his latest imprisonment he was given yet another new identity because of the risk posed by a previous security breach. He . was also arrested over a drunken brawl and cocaine offences, but the . then Justice Secretary Jack Straw allowed him to remain at large. Following his arrest for child porn . offences, it was revealed that Venables had fallen into a spiral of . drink and drug addiction because he struggled with the psychological . pressure of living under an assumed name. It is said to have taken officials two months to prepare his new identity. Venables was first given a new identity when he and Thompson were sent to a young offenders' institution for murdering the toddler. A second new identity was created for him when he was released in 2001, and he was given a third identity after he was sent back to jail in 2010 for possessing child abuse images. Each change of identity is believed to cost taxpayers around £250,000, with the total bill for Venables therefore reaching £1million with his latest release. A Ministry of Justice spokesman said: 'We do not comment on individual offenders. 'The re-release of life licensed offenders is directed by the independent Parole Board once they are satisfied they can be safely managed in the community.'","Venables, 31, left prison last week without the knowledge of victim's family .

"The stunning view from his waterside home inspired some of Dylan Thomas's greatest works. But the Welsh poet's beloved landscape is under threat after officials granted permission for a 147ft wind turbine to be built right in the middle of it. His family are embroiled in a fight to stop the development, following celebrations to mark 100 years since Thomas's birth. The view from Dylan Thomas's home is under threat after planning officials granted permission for a 147ft turbine (red dot in picture above) Dylan Thomas, who died at the age of 39, work included poem Do Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night . They say the turbine would ruin the picturesque countryside if it is built at Mwche farm in Llansteffan, Carmarthenshire – a short distance from the poet's Boathouse in Laugharne, on the other side of the Taf estuary. The view across the water inspired works such as Do Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night. The house is now a tea room and art gallery attracting thousands of visitors every year, and opponents say the turbine will destroy the setting. There are fears the development could even drive away tourists who visit the area that inspired Thomas, who was born 100 years ago. This map shows the proposed area for the wind turbine (small black dot, centre) and the distance between the development at Thomas's house across the Taf estuary . The view from the boathouse, where he said to have been inspired by wildlife and nature that surrounds area . Planning officers recommended refusing permission for the turbine over fears it would ruin the view from the Boathouse, but Carmarthenshire Council approved it. The author wrote poems including Over Sir John's Hill and some of Under Milk Wood at the boat house. Much of his work is said to be inspired by the wildlife and nature which surrounds the property. Dylan's Boathouse boasts wonderful views of the estuary, with egrets, lapwings, herons, oystercatchers, seals and otters all living in the area. Fans of the hell-raising poet, whose centenary is being celebrated this year, have been fighting a planner decision to give the 147ft-high turbine the go ahead. The poet's granddaughter Hannah Ellis, 36, said it was 'completely absurd' to grant planning permission for the wind turbine in Laugharne, West Wales. She said: 'To imagine a wind turbine there is very upsetting. His family has become embroiled in a fight to stop the development, following celebrations to mark 100 years since Thomas's birth this year . An aerial view of Laugharne - residents of the village challenged the council's decision to build the turbine . 'From a personal point of view I scattered mum's ashes at the Boathouse. We put a bench there, we sit there and it's my peaceful time.' Planning officers recommended refusing permission for the turbine over fears it would blight the view from the house. The National Trust said it would be a mistake to blight the view. Laugharne residents challenged the council's decision on a number of grounds, including that the planning committee acted 'irrationally' in departing from their officer's advice on landscape and cultural heritage harm. The committee had been advised that the turbine would be a 'discordant element and an alien intrusion within an historic landscape of exceptional sensitivity'. A High Court judge in Cardiff has now given permission for a judicial review of Carmarthenshire Council's planning decision. His Honour Judge Milwyn Jarman QC said the claim for a judicial review was 'arguable' and that it would get a full hearing in the New Year. Hannah Ellis, granddaughter of Dylan Thomas, inside a shed like the one where he wrote much of his work . She said it was 'completely absurd' to grant planning permission for the wind turbine and finds it 'upsetting' Annabel Graham Paul, representing the campaigners, said: 'This is a great step forward for the claim as it means that the council's decision-making process will be given full scrutiny by the High Court at an oral hearing. 'The residents behind the legal action are to be congratulated on getting things off the ground and seeking to take the council to task over this highly controversial decision.' Shadow Welsh Heritage, Culture and Tourism Minister Suzy Davies was among almost 500 people to lodge objections to the plans within sight of Laugharne Castle and the celebrated boathouse where Dylan wrote much of his work. She described the decision to grant planning permission as 'daft' and said allowing the turbine at such a celebrated site would 'stoke resentment against renewable energy'.

It was one of the issues identified by council officers in a report to the planning committee, which said: 'Tourism within the county is a key economic driver, therefore the impact on tourism is said to be significant.' It added that due to the centenary celebrations, Laugharne is the focus of 'intensive promotion and publicity'. Carmarthenshire Council said they are considering appealing the decision to grant a judicial review.

Huw Davie, of the Dylan Thomas Society of Great Britain, said erecting the wind turbine would 'desecrate' a celebrated view. The judicial review into the wind turbine plan will be heard in Cardiff on 21st of January.","Planning permission given for turbine at Mwche farm, across Taf estuary .

"Three African Union soldiers and a civilian contractor were killed when al-Shabab militants raided a Somali military base which also houses the British Embassy. The gunmen, some disguised in Somali National Army uniforms, stormed the African Union (AU) camp near Mogadishu Airport, opening fire during the Christmas Day lunch hour. Five of the extremists were also killed during the raid, around a mile from the British Embassy, while four were captured, officials said. Four al-Shabab militants were captured during the raid on an African Union military compound which also houses the British Embassy . The gunmen, some disguised in Somali National Army uniforms, stormed the African Union (AU) camp near Mogadishu airport, opening fire during the Christmas Day lunch hour . The AU compound also houses the British and Italian embassies as well as United Nations offices . Terrorist group al-Shabab claimed responsibility for the attack and said it was targeting a Christmas party at the compound, which also houses the Italian embassy and United Nations offices. The men entered the AU base near Mogadishu's airport, spokesman Colonel Ali Aden Houmed said. 'Our forces shot dead three of them, two detonated themselves near a fuel depot,' he added. 'An investigation is under way on how they entered the base.' In an audio posting on the militants' website, al-Shabab spokesman Sheikh Ali Mohamud Rage said the attack was carried out in retaliation for the killing of the group's leader Ahmed Abdi Godane in a US air strike this year. In the attack, Rage claimed the gunmen killed 14 AU soldiers and four foreigners, but the group often exaggerates the number of people it kills.

'The attack took place 1.6km (one mile) from the Embassy. Staff are on high alert for this kind of attack.' Ali Abdullahi, who lives near the airport, said all roads leading to the airport were closed off following the shoot-out and journalists were also kept away. AU troops are bolstering Somalia's weak government against an uprising from the al Qaeda-linked al-Shabab extremist group. A suicide bomber rammed his vehicle into a UN convoy near Mogadishu's airport earlier this month, killing three people just moments after Somalia's president entered the airport. No UN staff were injured. Al-Shabab controlled much of Mogadishu from 2007 to 2011, but were pushed out of Somalia's capital city by AU forces.","Al-Shabab militants raided an African Union base near Mogadishu Airport .

"Police are investigating whether the hostages injured in the shootout that ended the Sydney cafe siege were accidentally shot by armed officers as they stormed the Lindt Café. Three women – a 75 year old, a 52 year old and a 43 year old - received gunshot wounds to the shoulder, the foot and the leg respectively. NSW Police Homicide Squad detectives are looking at the possibility that at least one of the women were hit by bullets which ricocheted off the cafe walls, according to The Australian. Scroll down for video . Heavily armed police stormed the Sydney Lindt Cafe after gunman Man Haron Monis held 18 people hostage . A NSW spokeswoman told Daily Mail Australia they cannot comment on the case as it is an ongoing operation. Following the Martin Place siege, the hostages were taken to different hospitals and urged by police not to reveal what had happened inside the café due to a ‘critical incident investigation’. Three people died - including gunman Man Haron Monis - and four others - the women and a police officer who suffered a minor facial injury from gunshot pellets - were taken to hospital. During the stand-off, police armed with automatic rifles surrounded the premesis, with senior commanders saying they were prepared to take a patient approach to the siege, hoping to end it through negotiation with the gunman. But 17 hours later, shots were fired inside the café, prompting heavily armed police to shatter the glass doors and storm the building, throwing stun grenades. Hostages run towards armed tactical response police for safety right after the police stormed into the cafe . Self-proclaimed Sheik and gunman Man Haron Monis was among the three who died during the Sydney siege . The self-proclaimed sheik initiated the bloody ordeal which claimed the lives of Lindt Café manager Tori Johnson, 34, and barrister Katrina Dawson, 38. The Australian reports only one officer from the highly trained police squad was designated to target the gunman, rather than the dozen who were initially reported. The critical incident investigation led by detectives’ inspectors Angelo Memmolo and Grant Taylor will investigate how many bullets were fired and examine where it travelled in the café when shot by police. Police will also examine the type of shotgun Monis pulled from his bag, his ability to load and reload at speed and if he had any additional firearm. Heavily armed police have stormed the Sydney Lindt cafe where a gunman has been holding hostages for nearly 16 hours . One women who was held hostage, escaped after more than five hours under siege at Martin Place . The NSW Homicide Squad are investigating the sequence of events leading up to the deaths and all information will be provided to the NSW Coroner who will determine the cause of death and make any findings about the incident. Early details of the police investigation reveal Johnson was fatally shot in the head when the other hostages made a break by smashing down the café’s door shortly after 2am. Other reports suggested he had attempted to grab the gun from Monis. For 17 hours, three female hostages were also forced to stand in front of a black Islamic flag and relay demands by the gunman in separate videos and posted online, while others were ordered to contact media organisations. Just hours before the siege took place, it’s reported the gunman walked around Martin Place before entering the Lindt Café and sitting for up to an hour before he took staff and customers hostage.","Police are investigating whether the hostages who suffered gunshot wounds were shot by police when the Sydney siege ended in gunfire .

"Dressed-down: Zara with Commodore of the Cruising Yacht Club of Australia, John Cameron . They were notable absences from the royal gathering at Sandringham on Christmas Day. In fact, Zara Phillips and Mike Tindall were on the other side of the world – for the pair had business to attend to. The couple, along with their 11-month-old daughter Mia Grace, flew to Australia in mid-December to fulfil a series of lucrative commitments. Zara’s grandparents – the Queen and Prince Philip – and her mother, Princess Anne, spent Christmas Day at church before their traditional lunch at Sandringham House. Meanwhile, Zara was launching a yacht race in her role as a global ambassador for Rolex. The 33-year-old Olympic equestrian was all smiles in dressed-down attire, clad in shorts and a polo shirt, as she officially started the Sydney to Hobart race at the Cruising Yacht Club of Australia. According to sources, the family flew to Australia earlier this month to attend a friend’s wedding. They then enjoyed a brief holiday before Zara began work as the official starter of the Rolex-sponsored race, one of the toughest in the world. Clutching a toy seal as a gift for her daughter, Zara stood alongside fellow sporting celebrities to wave off the 144 yachts taking part. A spokesman for the former world-champion eventer, who hopes to represent Team GB again in Rio in 2016, said Zara will stay in Australia until late January to complete another of her work commitments, Magic Millions. Although it sounds like a quiz show, this is, in fact, one of the country’s most popular thoroughbred horse sales and race meets. According to informed sources, Zara was offered a ‘small fortune’ to become an ambassador for the event, which is held in Queensland over two weeks every January. Her trip is being bankrolled by Magic Millions co-owner Gerry Harvey, Australia’s 13th-richest man, who made his estimated £550million fortune from a chain of clothing stores. Zara was in Sydney to wave off competitors taking part in the Sydney to Hobart 2014 race in Australia . Zara and her husband Mike Tindall missed the royal gathering at Sandringham on Christmas Day . Tindall will join his wife and daughter for part of the trip to the Gold Coast, but will return to the UK early to prepare for his own new role – as a contestant in the Channel 4 reality series The Jump. He will be among 12 celebrities flying to Austria to take on a series of challenging winter sports for the TV show, which begins at the end of next month. A friend told the Mail: ‘Zara and Mike are in Australia as a mixture of holiday and work. ‘They were at a friend’s wedding earlier this month before Zara, in her role as [a Rolex ambassador], started the Rolex Sydney to Hobart race. She will also attend the Magic Millions at the beginning of January. They are there as a family but Mike will return early in the New Year for The Jump. Zara is pictured clutching a toy seal for her 11-month-old daughter Mia Grace, who she brought on the trip . ‘He will leave a few days earlier than Zara but she and Mia will stay on in Australia due to her commitments.’ The source added: ‘Zara is with friends of the family so she has no babysitting problems. She and Mia will travel back to the UK together.’ It is likely that the family will be back together before January 17 – Mia’s first birthday.","Zara Phillips and Mike Tindall were absent from Sandringham yesterday .

"Traditionally for cats, it's always been about getting the cream - so the old saying goes. But it appears the bar has been raised a tad higher - with champagne, wads of cash and even handguns now  the desired possession of choice. As this bizarre gallery shows, the world's richest cats are so well-off that they spend their time rolling around in piles of $100 notes, complete with a serving of Cognac on the side. Are you fur real? This 'cashcat' strikes a pose for the camera while surrounded by hundreds - and two guns . Aristocat: A bow-tie wearing ginger cat sits in front of $100 notes - and a bottle of cognac . Fatcat: This serious-looking puss stares threateningly as he guards his wads of £20 notes . Land of wad: This fluffy feline curls up for an afternoon nap amid a scattered piles of $20 notes . Not a pawper: This cat poses among $100 notes, three passports, a large knife - and a refreshing drink . The images feature on a website called cashcats.biz, a site set up to celebrate the 'top one purrcent' of rich moggies. Featuring pets from the U.S to the Maldives, this gallery of cats has become such an online sensation that only five per cent of submissions are ever used. Creator Will Zweigart, 35, said: 'One of the most fun aspects of the project is how varied the submissions are from a geographic perspective - every continent except Antarctica is represented. 'I can't even count all of the countries and types of currencies featured.' The website invites wealthy pet owners to post photos of their smug-looking cats surrounded by the trappings of their wealth. The 'cashcats' started out posing among wads of cash, but champagne, Cognac and other luxurious good soon started appearing in the background. Now Mr Zweigart is inundated with images showing the cats set up among  loaded guns and illegal drugs.

Al Catpone: This 'cashcat' lies among $20 notes - and an obligatory handgun . Cat that got the cream: This moggy is so chuffed with its collection of bank notes, it even stuck his toungue out at the photographer . He said: 'I've received a lot of submissions with cats surrounded by huge piles of drugs, because some folks who have $10,000 in cash lying around also have those things handy. 'I don't publish pictures like that for several reasons, mainly to ensure we don't set a bad example or create an unsafe environment for cats. 'We do occasionally publish pictures of cats who own guns, and evidently a lot of cats own guns around the world, which is surprising. 'The site is really just mirroring our culture - particularly rap culture - and how we think about power and status. For some people power is a passport and a bottle of Dom, for others it's a Glock.' The digital marketer says he was inspired to start the site by his fiancé's cat Fugazi, who has starred on the site several times. Keeping it capital: This smug-looking duo pose among piles of £20, £10 and £5 notes . Working from home: This pair of adorable kittens show off their loot in a fan of £20 notes .

Despite modest beginnings, Cashcats now has accounts on Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr and Instagram, thanks to submissions flowing in from around the globe. Mr Zweigart said: 'It's very diverse. I definitely get a lot of submissions from people who work in ""cash only industries"", if you will. 'Only about five per cent of several thousand submitted photos end up making the site. Consider the site like an exclusive VIP room for high net worth felines. 'To make it even harder - cats will not model for you, hold still, or bend to your will. Any photo shoot must be on their terms.' Extra cover: This cute-looking kitten puts on a second coat of crisp £10 notes . Pawsing for thought: This black and white beauty stops to reflect as it works it way through its wad of £20 notes . Champagne lifestyle: This wealthy duo spread themselves out among a pile of £100 notes and a bottle of bubbly . Money in the kitty: Two cute ginger and white cats peek out from their money-laden cubby hole . Despite the owners' desire to flash the cash, Mr Zweigart is clear that the cats are the real stars of the website. 'We all know that cats are slowly taking over the internet, partly because we don't really understand them,' he said. 'Cats are the only species who have managed to domesticate us, and they love how we haven't really figured that out yet. 'The site helps us to see cats how they see themselves - their facial expressions, which can convey power, status, mystery and an air of confidence that we can't exactly place. That 'one purrrcent' look.' Richer than mew: This feline sprawls across a bundle of $100 notes . Puss in loots: These two cats star each other out as they pose with their weapons and money . Living it up: This cat has so much cash in front of him, he can barely stand to look at it . He also said the feedback on the site has been overwhelmingly positive. He said: 'People send thank you notes on Tumblr saying it helped them get through a tough time, which is completely unexpected but awesome to hear. 'On social media, there is also a lot of self-identification, and I think that's why people share it on their own personal channels so much. 'It's a way of saying ""this is me when I get paid next week"" or ""I need to get my cat on this site, my cat needs to ball as hard as these cats"".' Rolling in it: This grey cat writhes happily in a scattered pile of $100 bills . Tucked away: A grey cat sits regally on rolls of US dollars -while his paw rests on a handgun .

"Dapper Laughs, the controversial persona supposedly 'killed off' by disgraced comedian Daniel O'Reilly, has been resurrected with the ominous message that his work 'isn't finished' yet. In a YouTube video called 'Merry Christmas', the 'sexist' and 'offensive' character is depicted in 'heaven' before being summoned back to earth by God who said he was 'needed down there'. He then confronts his creator, O'Reilly, who appears to be a simpering mess after his appearance on BBC2 current affairs show Newsnight last month when he declared 'Dapper Laughs is gone'. O'Reilly asks: 'What are you doing here? You're supposed to be dead? I killed you off.' Scroll down for video . Dapper Laughs, the controversial persona supposedly 'killed off' by disgraced comedian Daniel O'Reilly, has been resurrected in a new video . He then confronts his creator, O'Reilly, and says his work down here on earth 'ain't finished' yet . And his belligerent alter-ego responds saying: 'What killed me off was you coming on Newsnight, c***blocking yourself wearing that turtleneck, looking like a French poet. 'What's wrong, you can't take it? Go on, you might as well go up there (to heaven) because my work down here (on earth) ain't finished.' More than 60,000 people signed a petition called for his ITV show Dapper Laughs: On The Pull to be cancelled after telling a female audience member she was 'gagging for a rape' at a show. The TV watchdog launched an investigation into his show which promoted dubious dating 'advice’ to men including: “Remember, it’s only sexual harassment if she’s more attractive than you”. In the new video released on Christmas Day, O'Reilly says: 'You ended up taking over my life. You're going to ruffle some feathers. Why don't you tone it down a bit? More than 60,000 people signed a petition called for his ITV show Dapper Laughs: On The Pull to be cancelled after telling a female audience member she was 'gagging for a rape' at a show . His controversial character then responds: 'Don't worry I'll keep it calm.' He was seen at the start of the video apparently in heaven, lounging as he is fed grapes by a buxom angel as another strums a harp. A voice presumed to belong to ‘God’ booms: “I’m sending you back to earth. You’re needed down there. O’Reilly has been crying his little b***s off.” Dapper replies saying: “Leave it out, I’m having a quality time, I’ve got everything I need. Couple of Britney Spears, a few sweethearts, the occasional b****.' When he appeared on Newsnight he admitted he had allowed himself to get 'carried away' with his own success after finding fame on social media. 'It's completely ruined everything that's going on with me as a comedian. The bad press and everything that's happened - it's wrecked my life to a certain extent,' he said. Wearing a black turtleneck and jacket, he mocked his  grovelling appearance on BBC Newsnight . When he appeared on Newsnight (pictured) in November he said he had allowed himself to get 'carried away' and declared that 'Dapper Laughs is gone' 'I am not going to allow Dapper Laughs to represent me. I want the people out there to know that not only am I going to stop it, I am going to help it not being promoted.' In a live performance at Scala, London in October he was seen joking about rape, right after making an apology for his 'sexist' and 'offensive' comments about homeless people. Referring to his ITV show and the controversy it had attracted, he was heard saying: 'If it was a guide to rape, I would have done one five-minute episode, come on and go 'Oi oi, I'm Dapper Laughs, go down the shops, get some rope, bit of duct tape, rape the b***h, well done, see you later'.' In the same show, he also told a female audience member that she was 'gagging for a rape'.

"The annual battle to be top of the Christmas TV came down to a fight between the bawdy Mrs Brown’s Boys and the traditional Queen’s Speech. And Her Majesty came out on top – with her message to the Commonwealth the only top-ten show to win more viewers than last year. The pre-recorded broadcast, shown on BBC1 and ITV1, secured a combined audience of 7.8million, an increase of 90,000 from last Christmas. The Queen's speech (pictured) has been the surprise hit of Christmas Day after it won the TV ratings way to become the most watched television programme yesterday . It was the one bright spot for broadcasters as more and more viewers either shunned a lacklustre array of programmes or decided to watch online, on iPlayer or on delayed channels, according to the Broadcasters Audience Research Board. The Queen chose reconciliation as her theme for the 15-minute broadcast, mentioning her Ulster visit, the Scottish referendum and the centenary of the First World War. Speculation that she would abdicate during the broadcast had led bookmakers to stop taking bets on the issue. Mrs Brown’s Boys, a raucous sitcom about an Irish family that was last year’s most-watched Christmas Day programme, won 7.6million viewers this time around – a fall of 1.8million. Last year's Christmas Day ratings winner, Mrs Brown's Boys came in second place with 7.61 million viewers . Of the big Christmas specials, BBC drama Doctor Who suffered the biggest decline in year-on-year viewing, with 6.34million tuning in, or 24 per cent fewer than last year, when former Doctor Matt Smith was seen regenerating into Peter Capaldi, who has replaced him in the role. Downton Abbey also suffered badly, managing the ninth spot with 5.8million viewers, down 800,000 from last year’s 6.6million. The once-popular series has seen figures slump since 2011, when it secured 8.1million on Christmas Day, suggesting fans are growing tired of its slow-moving storylines. Many have branded the programme dull, raising speculation it may be time for ITV to bring it to an end. EastEnders was top of the soaps with figures of 7.55 million, compared to Coronation Street's 6.62 million and Emmerdale's 5.71 million . Doctor Who pulled in 6.34 million to be named the eighth most watched programme of the day - a disappointing 24 per cent drop on last year's Christmas special . Some predict this year’s Christmas Day audience figures will be among the lowest on record, reflecting changing viewing behaviour. The rise of online streaming services such as Netflix, on-demand viewing and catch-up iPlayer services provided by the BBC and ITV mean many no longer watch a programme when it is initially broadcast. Critics will also see the decline in ratings as evidence that festive programming is not as good as it once was. EastEnders, the BBC1 soap which once dominated Christmas Day ratings, came third with 7.5million, ahead of the Strictly Come Dancing Christmas special, with just under 7million viewers, and Call the Midwife, with 6.8million. ITV soap Coronation Street attracted 6.4million viewers. A BBC spokesman said: ‘It’s fantastic to see millions of viewers choosing BBC1, with the top five most popular shows on Christmas Day.’ There were also less viewers watching the Crawley family celebrate Christmas in Downton Abbey, with 5.84 million watching ITV from 9pm yesterday .","An average of 7.8m watched this year's royal message on reconciliation .

"A woman with a penchant for tattoos has covered her body in 17 different inkings - including over her mastectomy scars - to depict each chapter of her life. Joanne Jackson, 43, from Dewsbury, West Yorks., was diagnosed with breast cancer in June 2011 and later underwent a mastectomy. But rather than let it affect her confidence and self-esteem, Joanne - in her words - 'kicked cancer in the ass'. Breast cancer survivor Joanne Jackson  has turned her body into a canvas to erase her cancer ordeal . The mother-of-two had a breast reconstruction and to erase her cancer ordeal, she has turned her body into a canvas. Joanne, from Thornhill, Dewsbury, said: 'It's a statement of intent and a show of strength for what I've been through. 'I don't drink and I don't smoke but ink is my thing. I am a collector of fine art, which just happens to be on my body and not on my walls.' Joanne, who is married to Andrew, 47, and has two sons Evan, seven, and Connah, 22, had her first tattoo - a small bird on her thigh - aged 21. Now she has a 'full sleeve' on her left arm depicting strong women, Geisha girls and Samurai warriors. The sleeve, created by tattoo artist Matt Evans, of Slawit Ink in Slaithwaite, took 20 hours and five sessions to complete. This brightly coloured peacock has taken 14 hours and is yet to be completed. The blue tail fathers across Joanne's stomach hide the scars from surgery to remove fat needed for the breast reconstruction. Joanne was diagnosed with breast cancer in June 2011 and later underwent a mastectomy. She posed for these pictures in 2012 to prove that women could still be sexy and confident after the dramatic surgery. A  brightly coloured peacock, the work of Kim Walsh, of Ink Station in Heckmondwike, sweeps  around her body. It has taken 14 hours so far and will be finished in the next couple of weeks. Surgeons took fat from her stomach for the breast reconstruction leaving scarring from hip to hip. Those scars are now hidden beneath the blue tail feathers of the peacock. 'It's a stunning piece,' said Joanne. 'It marks an end to what I have been through.' Joanne's other tattoos include a cancer ribbon on her back and a breastfeeding mother with four lilies to signify the four miscarriages she suffered. She also has famous quotations from Eleanor Roosevelt, First Lady of the United States and wife to President Franklin D. Roosevelt, on her left thigh. One of the quotes reads: 'You gained strength and courage by every experience in which you really stop to look fear in the face. You are able to say to yourself I have lived through this horror and I can the next thing that comes along. You must do the thing you think you cannot do.' Joanne has a 'full sleeve' on her left arm depicting strong women, Geisha girls and Samurai warriors. The sleeve took 20 hours and five sessions to complete . In 2012 Joanne commissioned a photographer to take pictures of her posing topless after her mastectomy. She wanted to prove that women could still be sexy and confident, she says. She posted the pictures on Facebook and was furious when the social network removed them and threatened to close her account. Joanne admits she is running out of bare skin but has planned a few more tattoos - including one on her thighs and ribs. She added: 'I know tattoos aren't everyone's cup of tea but they have come a long way from the days when they were associated with yobs and thugs. 'It's such an art form and there are some amazing tattoo artists out there and I have found two of them. This is what I do and I am growing old disgracefully!'","Joanne Jackson, 43,  was diagnosed with breast cancer in June 2011 .

"Researchers have uncovered a protein they say controls how the body produces fat cells. Called Thy1 it has a fundamental role in controlling whether a primitive cell decides to become a fat cell. Experts say it could be harnessed in obesity treatments. Scroll down for video . Called Thy1, the protein has a fundamental role in controlling whether a primitive cell decides to become a fat cell. Experts say it could be harnessed in obesity treatments. An estimated 60 million people are defined as clinically obese in the United States. Diseases associated with obesity include Type 2 diabetes, various heart conditions and some cancers. Worldwide obesity has nearly doubled since 1980, according to the World Health Organization. Researchers say the obesity epidemic is growing fastest in well-developed regions such as Asia, Latin America, and parts of the Middle East. 'We believe that weight gain is not necessarily just a result of eating more and exercising less,' said lead author Richard Phipps of the University of Rochester. 'Our focus is on the intricate network involved in fat cell development.' The Rochester teram discovered that a protein, Thy1, has a fundamental role in controlling whether a primitive cell decides to become a fat cell, making Thy1 a possible therapeutic target, according to a study published online this month by the FASEB Journal. Although Thy1 was discovered 40 years ago and has been studied in other contexts, its true molecular function has never been known. Phipps' laboratory reported for the first time that expression of Thy1 is lost during the development of fat cells, suggesting obesity could be treated by restoring Thy1. They're also working towards developing an anti-obesity drug, a Thy1-peptide, and have applied for an international patent to protect the invention. Phipps has been investigating Thy1 since 1989; The UR is trying to identify a company to help with commercializing the patent asset and bring a new obesity treatment to the marketplace. 'Our goal is to prevent or reduce obesity and in this paper we've shown how to do this in principle,' said Phipps. Researchers studied mice and human cell lines to confirm that a loss of Thy1 function promotes more fat cells. Mice lacking the Thy1 protein and fed a high-fat diet gained more weight and faster, compared to normal mice in a control group that also ate the same high-fat diet. In addition, the fatter mice without Thy1 had greater than twice the levels of resistin in their blood, a biomarker for severe obesity and insulin-resistance or diabetes. 'Our goal is to prevent or reduce obesity and in this paper we've shown how to do this in principle,' said Phipps. Experiments using human fatty tissue from the abdomen and eyes showed similar results. Phipps and colleagues, including key researcher Collynn Woeller, Ph.D., research assistant professor of Environmental Medicine, are continuing to investigate why cells with the potential to turn into fat cells lose the Thy1 protein, and why fat accumulates faster when Thy1 shuts off. It's not clear whether Thy1 levels are different in people at birth, or whether they change with time and exposure to various environmental agents. To address the latter question, Phipps' laboratory is separately studying whether chemicals known as obesogens – such as bisphenol A (BPA), flame retardants, and phthalates – reduce Thy1 expression in human cells and promote obesity.","Called Thy1, protein controls whether a primitive cell becomes a fat cell .

"The consumer version of the much anticipated Oculus Rift virtual reality headset is just months away - and experts have started to speculate on what it could look like. Facebook purchased the company earlier this year in a $2bn (£1.2bn) deal. However, one expert says its success could depend on its design - and has created his own. Scroll down for video . The sleek design has been made to resemble a set of hi-tech goggles - and its creator says he hopes people could mistake wearer's for simply having 'the world's fanciest goggles'. CEO Brendan Iribe told the audience at Web Summit 2014 in Dublin earlier this year, that a consumer-version of the company's VR headset is 'close'. MailOnline has been using the latest version of the headset, the $350 (£215) DK2 version aimed at developers wanting to write VR apps. At first we were skeptical - the headset looks bulky, although it is surprisingly light when attached via straps. However, once you are immersed in a virtual world, doubts were quickly forgotten. The technology, still just a developer's version, is breathtakingly good. While the resolution still doesn't give the feeling of quite being in the real world, it does make you think you are actually in a virtual world. The number of demos and games is already growing by the day, and feature everything from virtual rollercoaster rides to being lost in space, all made more immersive with head tracking meaning the images moved perfectly as your head moves. It's not quite ready for primetime yet, but is almost there - and the Oculus Rift headset finally delivers on the long awaited promise of virtual reality. Syed Rahman says he was inspired by the project - but not its design. However, Rahman believes the firm still has a major task ahead - making it look attractive. 'From a functionality standpoint, the Oculus Rift is spectacular, he said. 'I had the opportunity to visit their headquarters this past summer and was swept away by my incredible experience there. Virtual Reality is our future. But in order for widespread adoption they've got to overcome one last obstacle. Design.' Rahamn says the technology must be made to look attractive. 'As great as the Rift might be, how are we going to start sitting around with big black boxes strapped to our faces? Picture walking into a room, only to see your friends and family sitting around with boxes on their faces. I don't see that being a common scene anytime soon.' 'Ultimately I settled for a clean, sleek look,' he explains on his web site. 'The headset resembles ski goggles, a familiar object, finished with a reflective front. 'To a passerby, you'd appear to be wearing the world's fanciest goggles on your face. Currently Oculus only sells its headset to developers. CEO Brendan Iribe told the audience at Web Summit 2014 in Dublin earlier this year, that a consumer-version of the company's VR headset is 'close'. He admitted the latest prototype, codenamed Crescent Bay, is 'largely finalized for a consumer product.' 'We're all hungry for it to happen,' he told the audience. 'We're getting very close. It's months, not years away, but many months.' He also revealed one area holding back the product was the lack of a controller. He said keyboards, mice and gamepads aren't up to the job and neither is gesture-control. 'You want to feel it when you touch a button,' he said. Oculus acquired Carbon Design, the designers of the Xbox 360 controller in March. Iribe also revealed that although the technology is currently similar to ski goggles, future versions will look like sunglasses. Iribe also revealed the company has changed significantly since it was acquired by Facebook in March. The current design: The Crescent Bay virtual reality headset (pictured) was unveiled at the Oculus Connect conference in Hollywood. It is lighter than its predecessor and features 360-degree tracking, but Oculus VR is yet to release the full list of specifications for the device. Operating as an independent subsidiary, Oculus has grown from 75 people to over 200 employees and now operates a separate R&D division. Asked about the threat of rival VR products, Iribe said his main concern is shoddy implementation. In recent months dozens of firms have revealed low cost headsets using a movbile phone as the display. 'We're a little worried about bigger companies putting out products that aren't ready. 'Disorientation and motion sickness is the elephant in the room. 'We're encouraging big companies not to put out a product before it's ready. 'We want to get it right, we don't want it to be four or five years. We're eager for this to happen.' Rahman's 'ski goggle' design is far sleeker . Earlier this year the Facebook-owned firm has unveiled its Crescent Bay model of the virtual reality technology that is lighter than its predecessor, and now features 360-degree tracking. Reports claimed the consumer version of the device will launch in 2015 and could cost as little as $200 (£122). Iribe says it is too early to say what the 'killer app' is - but said it could even be face to face talking. 'One that resonates with us internally is that this will have a big aspect of gaming, where you feel like you're in the game or movie. 'But when we can have face to face conversations, that's a big change'If in the future you can throw in a pair on sunglasses and have the same conversation we are having, that's really transformative.' The 360-degree tracking means the headset will be able to more accurately monitor a wearer's head movements, which in turn will make games more immersive and true-to-life. Elsewhere, the headset has a higher resolution, per eye, than the current second-generation development kit – DK2 - and these displays are powered by Samsung devices. Rahman even design the headset's internals, showing how each part fits together . The headset resembles ski goggles, a familiar object, finished with a reflective front. A teardown of the DK2 revealed that the headset uses Samsung Galaxy Note 3 displays, and experts claim the latest generation device will feature screens from the flagship Note 4. By comparison, the DK2 has a resolution of 960 x 1080 per eye, and the Note 4 screens would give the latest model 1280 x 1440 resolution. Aside from these specifications, Oculus VR is yet to release the rest of Crescent Bay's features. 'There are plenty of technical challenges left to solve for the consumer Rift, but Crescent Bay is truly the best virtual reality headset we've ever built,' said Mr Iribe. The price of the Oculus Rift consumer model, which does not have a release date yet, was revealed by Oculus VR co-founder Nate Mitchell. Speaking with Eurogamer, Mr Mitchell said the price could go up to $400 (£240), but that the price range was an estimate. He also cautioned that nothing is set in stone. 'That could slide in either direction depending on scale, pre-orders, the components we end up using, [or] business negotiations,' he said. Previously, Oculus VR said it was aiming to launch the consumer model for around $300 (£185). Developers can currently buy protoype versions of the headset for $350 (£215). The firm also revealed earlier this month it has been working with Samsung on a mobile version of the headset, which will go on sale this year, but will not feature the advanced head tracking or high resolution display the Oculus version is expected to have. Facebook purchased the company earlier this year when its $2bn (£1.2bn) deal to buy VR headset firm Oculus was approved. It will first be used for immersive games, but Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg promised the headset will 'change the way we work, play and communicate' - although virtual worlds could include advertising admitted Zuckerberg. A commercial version is rumoured to launch in 2015. The purchase of Oculus put Facebook in a battle with Sony, which has already unveiled its own version of a VR headset, destined for the PS4 next year.","Oculus VR is yet to release the full list of specifications for the device .

"Trevor Shonk, who represents Ukip on Kent County Council and Ramsgate Town Council, blamed Labour and the Conservatives for allowing in more immigrants than the country could cope with . The Ukip leadership has moved to distance the party from remarks made by one of its councillors who claimed an 'overload' of immigrants had turned Britain into a racist country. Trevor Shonk, who represents Ukip on Kent County Council and Ramsgate Town Council, blamed Labour and the Conservatives for allowing in more immigrants than the country could cope with. But Ukip deputy chairman Suzanne Evans later rejected the suggestion, saying that Mr Shonk didn't express himself 'as well as he could'. Speaking to BBC Radio 4's The World at One, Mr Shonk said: 'The two main parties that have been running this country have made the country racist because of the influx that we have had. 'When I've done leaflets every shopkeeper, whether they are Asian or English born, they're concerned about the influx. 'It hasn't been staggered, it's just overload. We haven't got the care homes, we haven't got the houses for our own.' However Ukip deputy chairman Suzanne Evans rejected the suggestion that Britain was racist and said that Mr Shonk 'didn't express it as well as he could'. 'I think Britain is actually a very accommodating country and I don't think by any stretch of the imagination can be termed racist,' she told The World at One. 'I know what councillor Shonk meant. Perhaps he didn't express it as well as he could. There has of course been a massive increase in immigration which people find incredibly difficult to deal with.' The incident comes after Ukip parliamentary candidate Kerry Smith was forced to stand down over racist and homophobic comments he made. And earlier this week, Ukip expelled a prominent local councillor who is understood to have links with a far-Right group. It comes after parliamentary candidate Kerry Smith (left) was forced to stand down over racist comments.

"The world's biggest fan of comedy duo The Chuckle Brothers has spent more than £25,000 collecting rare memorabilia associated with the pair. Shaun Hope, 43, has spent the past 15 years collecting more than 500 autographs, posters, leaflets and rare merchandise featuring Barry and Paul Elliott. Mr Hope, from Willington, Co Durham, began his Chuckle Brothers obsession after seeing them play live at the Darlington Civic Theatre in 2001. Shaun Hope, centre, spent £25,000 collecting the world's largest collection of Chuckle Brothers memorabilia . Mr Hope, became a fan of Paul Elliott, left and his brother Barry, right, after seeing their live show in 2001 . Such is his devotion to the Chuckle Brothers, Mr Hope has turned his spare room into a shrine to the duo . Such is the extent of his devotion to the brothers, Paul, 67, and Barry, 69, he has converted the spare room of his house in Willington, Co Durham as a shrine to display his unique collection. The Chuckle Brothers were major figures in children's entertainment during the 1990s with their own hit-rated television show. Mr Hope said: 'I first started collecting after I got up on stage with them. I took my family to see a show and they got me up to take part. 'I was dressed up as the daddy bear, from Goldilocks and the three bears. Since then I've met them a few hundred times. 'After the show, we got a few bits and pieces, a shirt and a cap and things, and it has just gone from there really. I've got stuff they've never even seen.' Since his first meeting with the Rotherham-born brothers, stars of the hit 90s TV show 'Chucklevision,' Shaun has dedicated his time to run a string of fans sites. He runs the official Chuckle Brothers Facebook page and is even in charge of a petition to get them back on TV. He said: 'So far, we've got over 6,000 signatures in a couple of months.' Mr Hope has also passed his obsession on to sons Ben, 19, and Jack, 13. Even Mr Hope's two sons Ben, back middle, and Jack, front middle, are massive Chuckle Brothers fans . Mr Hope has even managed to track down incredibly rare memorabilia featuring the comedy legends . He added: 'My two sons are big fans as well. Ben is in the army now and when the lads all found out about it, he was quite popular.' Among the items Mr Hope has collected are videos, DVDs and even part of the Chuckle Mobile, but he thinks his most valuable piece of memorabilia is a signed copy of the video Chuckle Brothers: Live and In Trouble. He said: 'The video was never properly released. It was supposed to be but there was some trouble with the producers and they stopped it. Only four copies were let out in the end. 'I bought it for £50 and when I took it to them they signed it and promised that would be the only one they would ever sign.' Over the years, the super-fan has become good friends with Paul, 67, and Barry, 69, whom he describes as 'the world's funniest performers.' Barry said: 'When Shaun comes to see us we always invite him backstage and he has a cup of tea with us. He is more like a mate.'","Shaun Hope from Co Durham has spent £25,000 on the Chuckle Brothers .

'Some of the others who made their way home later called triple zero,' paramedic team leader Brendan Keane said on Friday. A 30-year-old man was taken to Frankston Hospital in a stable condition . Paramedics say only a few of the 44 party guests at Percy Cerutty Oval (pictured), which included six children, were unaffected . 'With lots of barbecues and parties over the holidays it's important for people to take some simple food handling precautions and reduce the chances of food poisoning.' A 30-year-old man was taken to Frankston Hospital in a stable condition. Victoria's Health Department recommends the following 10 tips to prevent food poisoning from spoiling your summer fun . 1. Set your thermostat. Make sure the fridge temperature is below 5 °C and keep your freezer at minus 15 °C to minus 18 °C. Stock your cooler well with ice packs or clean ice. Keep salads fresh and meat safe in the cooler or fridge at 5 °C or less until cooking or serving. 2. Get food home quickly. Take chilled, frozen or hot food straight home in insulated containers. 3. Keep hot food hot. If you don't want to cool food straight away, keep hot food at 60 °C or hotter. Reheat foods thoroughly so they're steaming (above 75 °C) or boiling. 4. Don't leave hot foods to completely cool before refrigerating. Put hot food in the fridge or freezer as soon as the steam stops rising. Cool it rapidly first by dipping the container in ice or a cold-water bath. Divide food into smaller, shallower containers so it cools more quickly in the fridge. 5. Keep raw meat, chicken and seafood chilled and away from cooked food. When bacteria from raw meat gets onto cooked food, this can cause food poisoning. Keep raw meat below other foods in the fridge and don't let raw meat juices drip onto other food. Use different chopping boards for raw and cooked food, or wash them between uses. Wash your hands thoroughly after touching raw meat. 6. Thaw frozen food thoroughly. Unless food is manufactured to be cooked from frozen (check pack instructions), make sure it's thawed right through before cooking. 7. Don't overfill your fridge. Having enough room for air circulation inside the fridge is important for effective cooling. A good tip if you're catering for a crowd is to keep drinks on ice or in an insulated cooler and reserve the space in your fridge for food. 8. Store leftovers safely. Store any leftovers in the fridge and eat within three to five days. If you don't plan to eat them within this time, freeze them straight away. 9. Know when to throw away. Don't eat food that's been left out of the fridge for more than fourhours – especially poultry, meat, seafood, cooked rice and cooked pasta. 10. Avoid handling food when you're not feeling well. If you have diarrhoea, vomiting, sore throat with fever, fever or jaundice, or infectious skin conditions, avoid handling food and see a doctor if symptoms persist.

"Parking charges and fines reached record levels last year, as councils continued to use motorists as cash cows. Local authorities collected almost £4million every day in 2013/14, according to responses to Freedom of Information requests. The amount handed out in penalty notices and parking meter charges added up to £1.38billion in England, compared with £1.32billion the year before. Cash cow: Parking charges and fines reached record levels last year with local authorities making almost £4million every day . Westminster Council – which is run by the Conservatives and covers Central London – made the most, at £81million. In 2012, Eric Pickles, the Communities Secretary, vowed to expose the ‘great council cash cow cover-up’ over parking. He described the charges as a ‘shopping tax’ and accused councils of waging a ‘local war against motorists’. Mr Pickles has imposed a series of freezes on council tax, and has called on councils to cut waste and reduce the salaries of highly paid staff. The latest figures suggest that, rather than making cuts, local authorities may be using motorists to raise revenue. Shopkeepers say heavy parking charges harm town centres, encouraging people to drive to out-of-town shopping malls or to use the internet. Labour, which collated the figures, says they show that people in Conservative council areas in the south of England fare the worst. Tory authorities took in £31.69 per resident in charges and fines, 41 per cent more than the £22.50 per resident for Labour councils. Eric Pickles, the Communities Secretary, said the figures show how town halls are 'committing daylight robbery by ripping off drivers' A representative sample of 214 of the 326 councils in England responded to Labour’s survey, which found that in 2013/14, the total amount of charges and fines across those 214 councils was £891million. This suggests that the total across England was £1.38billion, or £3.78million every day. In London, the revenue was £65.01 per resident – more than five times the £12.06 in the West Midlands and the North West. Councils in the South West raised £27.32 per resident, compared with the South East (£24.69), East of England (£18.71) and Yorkshire and Humber (£12.95). Conservative authorities raised an average of £31.69 per resident, compared with £22.50 for Labour. Hilary Benn, Labour’s local government spokesman, said: ‘David Cameron and Eric Pickles claimed they would bring parking charges and fines down but they have completely failed. Tory councils are making most money from charges and fines.’ Last year Mr Pickles told town halls to reduce parking charges that ‘undermine the vitality of town centres’. He issued guidance urging councils to make high streets more car-friendly, saying ‘anti-car policies’ were ‘driving motorists into the arms of internet retailers and out-of-town superstores’. Last night, Mr Pickles said: ‘These figures show how town halls are committing daylight robbery by ripping off drivers.’","Amount handed out in penalty notices and parking meter charges added up to £1.38bn England in 2013/14 .

"For Christmas 1914, Alice Bailey, a seven-year-old from Kent, England, got a pair of stockings and a toy farm animal. Daisy Andrews, her two-year-old neighbor, was given a length of ribbon. It may not seem much, but, with their fathers hundreds of miles away, fighting the bloody battles that would come to be known as the First World War, it was more than either of them had hoped for. Their humble presents, listed alongside the names in hundred-year-old records and letters of thanks, were gifts from the United States, which had sailed thousands of miles from New York on a vessel dubbed The Santa Claus Ship. Scroll down for video . Sailing to town: The USS Jason, dubbed The Santa Claus ship, was stacked up with 5million presents and sailed from New York City to England, carrying festive cheer to the victims of war. It is pictured docking in Plymouth in 1914 . Charity drive: Thousands around the country donated to the cause - spurred on by such contributions as this song in honor of the Christmas Ship - which shows an idealized version of the mission on the front. The blurb explained to children how an iron warship would actually be used . The cargo – a far cry from the coal it usually carried to fire the dreadnoughts of the U.S. Navy – included gloves, stockings, petticoats, sweets and nuts among its total of 5million presents, which together weighed 12,000 tons. The ship, properly called the USS Jason, made its first transatlantic stop in Plymouth, Devon, where it unloaded its trove of gifts for children around Great Britain. The presents were distributed by officials from charities including the Soldiers' and Sailors' Families Association (now know as SSAFA), who handed out the gifts starting with children whose father had been killed in battle or was missing, and refugee families from Belgium. A 1914 SSAFA report from Lowestoft, Suffolk, said: 'The Town Hall steps and landing were quite crowded with eager youngsters, among whom some 900 gifts, usually a garment and a toy, were distributed.' Charity drive: This picture shows crowds of volunteers - including one, right, dressed as an elf - crammed the presents into crates for their journey across the Atlantic . The ship then continued its voyage on to brighten the Christmases of children in Belgium and other parts of Europe touched by the conflict, the magnitude of which was only starting to become clear. The humanitarian mission was the result of a huge charity drive in the United States, which began with Chicago but inspired families all over the country to give some of what they had. News of the ship reached Britain well in advance. A report in the September 22, 1914, edition of the Daily Mail read recounted how the plan 'spread in a few days throughout the Western and Eastern States, and is approved by the great officials in Washington. Spreading the news: This September 1914 report in the UK's Daily Mail newspaper proclaimed the project . 'They ask the children of America to be Santa Claus next Christmas for all those little boys and girls whose daddies died fighting for their country. '""You can stretch out your hands,"" says the appeal, ""across the sea bearing messages of love and hope and sympathy to the children of a war-ridden Continent - messages from fortunate America to unfortunate Europe.' An advert for the scheme, from the McKinley Music Company in New York, which published a song promoting the scheme, was addressed directly to American children. It said: 'Isn't this a glorious opportunity for you to help make some of these poor little children happy? 'Just think what it means when our good President Wilson, and his Secretary of the Navy Daniels, have arranged to let one of our own country's great warships be the Christmas Ship. 'It means that our government considers it very important for this great shipload of presents to cross the ocean in perfect safety, so that every present may be promptly delivered. 'There never was a Christmas Ship before! There may never be a Christmas Ship again! Here is a chance for you to be one of the givers and help make next Christmas the best that was ever known on earth!' Jo Gunnell, a chairman for the Kent branch of SSAFA, said: 'It was a very striking gesture'. 'It was the moral support, as well as as the actual value of the gifts – though that shouldn't be underestimated, paltry as it may seem in this day and age.' 'There was a real bond between the countries then, as there continues to be today.'","In winter 1914, Britain was suffering in the war - but America had not joined .

"They could be the ultimate gadget for the post Christmas lull - glasses than can tell when you're about to nod off. Japanese firm Jins says its Meme smart spectacles are able to determine levels of mental and physical tiredness by monitoring eye movements. They can also keep an eye on health, and even improve posture as sensors check you the wearer is sitting. Scroll down for video . The glasses use sensors in the arms and nose bridge to detect tiny changes in eye and body movements so you can monitor your body for better safety, wellness and health. The glasses use bio-sensing technology to detect tiny changes in eye and body movements so you can monitor your body for better safety, wellness and health. The sensors sit on the nose and near the ears of the user, measuring the electrical potential in eye movements. The voltage differences between the cornea and retina can be translated into data for parameters such as alertness, the firm says. The glasses use bio-sensing technology to detect tiny changes in eye and body movements so you can monitor your body for better safety, wellness and health. Three electrooculography  electrodes installed where the frame touches the face and six-axis sensors along the earpiece constantly capture information about the wearer. The sensors sit on the nose and near the ears of the user, measuring the electrical potential in eye movements. The voltage differences between the cornea and retina can be translated into data for parameters such as alertness, the firm says. 'Recovery rates from tiredness in humans drop dramatically once a certain threshold is crossed. JINS MEME can detect and alert you to those levels before reaching that point, providing a new kind of management tool for preventing tiredness from accumulating and for improving work efficiency,' the firm says. In plans to launch the glasses  for the first time in the U.S. at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas from January 6-9. 'Developed following nearly five years of research with leading academics and doctors in Japan, sensors in JINS MEME capture information from your body to encourage better health, safety and wellness actions via the companion JINS MEME app for iOS and Android.' it says. An app analyses data from the sensors to work out exactly how we are standing, sitting and how alert or tired the wearer is. The firm is working with  doctors and researchers to explore additional features, such as measuring interest levels, providing biofeedback for focus-training exercises and possible diagnostic applications for cognitive and neurodegenerative diseases. 'Since launching JINS in 2001, we have encouraged people to change the way they view the world, to enrich their lives and unlock new experiences through eyewear,' said said CEO Hitoshi Tanaka. 'With JINS MEME, we are changing the game for digital eyewear with a focus on both function and fashion.' The $199 glasses are available in three styles . The frames were designed by world renowned industrial designer Satoshi Wada of SWdesign, who is responsible for other groundbreaking designs including the Audi A6 and ISSEY MIYAKE W watch. 'JINS MEME measures how our eyes and body move,' said Dr. Ryuta Kawashima, Professor of Tohoku University's Institute of Development, Ageing and Cancer, who has worked closely with JINS in the development of the glasses. 'From these movements, we can gather a huge amount of biological information. And we're just starting to see the possibilities.

"Relatives of two Britons murdered on a Thai beach  have today come face-to-face for the first time with those accused of killing their loved ones. Court proceedings began today for the case of two Burmese men charged with the murder of David Miller, 24, and Hannah Witheridge, 23, whose  badly mutilated bodies were found on a picturesque Thai beach in September. Family members of the British pair today sat through the proceedings, held on the island of Koh Samui, where defence and prosecution lawyers submitted plans for the evidence and witnesses involved in the case. The bodies of Ms Witheridge and Mr Miller were found on a Koh Tao beach the morning after a party . Court proceedings for the case against Burmese migrant workers Win Zaw Htun (left) and Zaw Lin (right) began today. The two have been charged with the murder of tourists David Miller and Hannah Witheridge . A judge set a trial date for July 8, when the case is expected to resume with evidence from prosecution witnesses. Win Zaw Htun and Zaw Lin, both 21, deny killing Mr Miller, from Jersey, and Ms Witheridge, from Great Yarmouth, Norfolk. The judge also rejected a plea from the defence to delay proceedings until they could further prepare their case. Before today's unexpected hearing, the trial had been expected to start in February. The victims' bodies were found with severe head wounds on a beach on the holiday island of Koh Tao on September 15. Police claimed that Ms Witheridge was raped during the attack and that two semen samples had been found on her body. The two suspects retracted confessions initially made to police in October, claiming that they had only confessed after being beaten and threatened by officers. Thai police have been criticised for their failure to secure the crime scene and releasing the names and pictures of suspects who were not subsequently charged. At a hearing earlier this month the pair's lawyer, Nakorn Chompoochart, said they had pleaded not guilty to several charges relating to the deaths. They are accused of conspiracy to commit murder, rape, criminal cover-up, illegally entering Thailand and staying in the country without permission, according to previous court papers seen by the BBC. The backpackers bodies were found on Sairee Beach (pictured), on the island of Ko Tao, in September. File image used . A Foreign Office spokesman said: 'We continue to monitor the case closely and expect the trial to be conducted in a fair and transparent way in line with international standards. 'The British government cannot interfere with Thailand's judicial processes just as other government's are unable to interfere in UK judicial processes.

"Household incomes will continue to rise next year - but will not return to their pre-crash levels until early 2016, a think tank warned last night. The forecast from the Resolution Foundation is much more pessimistic than the official Treasury estimate that incomes will return to these levels in the middle of next year. The economic think tank said that while it expects real household incomes to grow steadily during the course of 2015, they will still not match the pace of growth seen in the early 2000s. Household incomes will not return to their pre-crash levels until early 2016, a think tank warned. File photo . According to its analysis, incomes can be expected to rise by 1.7 per cent over the course of the year, meaning that they are unlikely to regain the level they were before the crash of 2008 until the early months of 2016. That contrasts with official estimates in the national accounts - based on figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) - which suggest a return to pre-crisis income levels by the middle of next year. Matthew Whittaker, chief economist at the Resolution Foundation, said: ‘After years of stagnation it’s encouraging that household incomes are set to rise again through 2015. ‘But household income per capita is still almost £600 lower than it was at the start of 2008 – and this shortfall doesn’t look like being made up until early 2016. ‘Household incomes are arguably the best measure of living standards. Timely and accurate data is therefore vital for making informed judgements on an issue that will feature heavily in the upcoming election. The official Treasury estimate is that incomes will return to these levels in the middle of next year. Pictured, Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne . ‘We will hear a lot of claim and counter-claim about living standards over the next five months. In the absence of better statistics, we will have no way of knowing how much of it is true.’ The new analysis found that in 2014, incomes have risen very slightly - up £130 on a low of £16,940 per capita in late 2013. But this is still £600 - or 3.3 per cent - below their pre-downturn peak. The independent think tank found that household incomes are expected to grow by 1.7 per cent in 2015. It said this would be a welcome return to the levels of steady income growth seen in the mid-2000s - but was well short of the strong growth seen at the start of that decade. The foundation warned that it will take some time to make up for the ground lost over recent years. A return to pre-downturn household incomes is unlikely to occur until early 2016. Similarly, the Resolution Foundation does not expect household incomes to have returned to the level seen at the time of last election until early 2016. It means that incomes will end the Parliament slightly lower than they started it, despite the recent recovery and expected growth in early 2015. The think tank challenged the way the ONS measures real household disposable income - in part because it includes the incomes of several non-household organisations, such as universities, charities and trade unions. It has also questioned the way that the ONS calculates the impact of inflation on household incomes.","Household incomes will continue to rise next year, but the Resolution Foundation warns they match growth seen in early 2000s until 2016 .

"A great-grandmother was left lying on her living room floor for more than seven hours waiting for an ambulance after she fell. Beth Sheppard, who is 19 stone and suffers from heart problems, was unable to get up after falling in her own home. Her daughter Joy, 38, dialled the ambulance trust's non-emergency line to ask for a lifting team to assist her 78-year-old mother. But when the family was told that no one from the community health team was available to attend their home in Bristol  and they would have to wait for a first responder to be dispatched from 999. More than five hours later, no one had arrived. A great-grandmother was left lying on her living room floor for more than seven hours waiting for a South Western Ambulance (pictured) to arrive . Joy said: 'I told the caller I thought this was appalling service and that my mother was now in pain. 'They kept telling me not to feed her or give her a drink, only a sip of water, which was impossible as she was on floor.'

Joy said: 'At 11.09pm I called 999 again and stated how disgusted I was and three minutes later a single paramedic arrived in a car.' The responder did not have lifting equipment so he had to call for another ambulance to attend as well.

"A baby gorilla raised by human keepers wearing hairy vests is ready to be placed with other gorillas and will move to the Columbus Zoo, the Cincinnati Zoo said Friday. Kamina, a young, female Western lowland gorilla, was born in August at the zoo in Oklahoma City but was shunned by her mother, so she was sent to Cincinnati in September. The human surrogates taught her to act like a gorilla and then placed her with two female gorillas. When they didn't bond with her, keepers decided Kamina's best option was moving to Columbus.

'Unfortunately, neither of the adult females that we hoped would bond with her did.' Officials are working out details of her transfer to the Columbus Zoo, which has previous experience with surrogacy placements. Adorable: Kamina is now awaiting her transfer to Columbus Zoo . Family: This team of team of human surrogates at Cincinnati Zoo & Botanical Garden have been raising her . Despite being raised by humans, Kamina's minders say she was been 'gorillafied' After Kamina arrived at the Cincinnati Zoo in September, 17 volunteers, nearly all zoo workers, took turns holding the baby around the clock, teaching her how to be a gorilla. Volunteers wore hairy vests to give Kamina something to cling too, bottle-fed her and crawled on their hands and knees so Kamina could practice abdominal and back riding. They used low grunting sounds to soothe her and coughing sounds to discourage behaviors. A previous surrogacy at Cincinnati worked out a little better, with keepers successfully raising 'Gladys,' a gorilla baby that came to Cincinnati in February 2013 from Brownsville, Texas, and was eventually incorporated into the zoo's gorilla troop. Shunned: Kamina's mother Ndjole did not demonstrate any signs of maternal care toward her baby . Columbus also has a long history of caring for gorillas. The first gorilla born in captivity, Colo, was born at the Columbus Zoo and celebrated her 58th birthday earlier this week.","Kamina was born at Oklahoma City zoo in August .
Her mother shunned her, so she was moved to Cincinnati, where she was raised by human surrogates .
Gorilla's there also failed to bond with her .
Her minders have decided to best place for her now is Columbus Zoo, which has previous experience with surrogacy placements ."
"Gamers have slammed hackers who knocked out Playstation and Xbox networks on the  day millions received consoles for Christmas. The online networks which allow game players to get the most out of their new machines went down yesterday, leaving many youngsters frustrated and parents furious. Notorious hacking group Lizard Squad, who had previously brought down both networks earlier this month, claimed responsibility for the sustained distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. As the disruption dragged on into a second day today, many desperate gamers sent messages to the group on Twitter, urging them to return service to normal. And while Microsoft XBL is back up, PlayStation remains down for many. This as the hackers revealed in an interview with WinBeta 'that the task simply began for the laughs,' also adding that they felt 'it would anger and reach the largest amount of people – more people angry calls for a greater response from the companies.' Theyv also claim to have stopped the attacks on the PlayStation Network, though it remains down. Scroll down for video . Gamers around the world were left disappointed on Christmas Day after hacking group Lizard Squad carried through with its threat to bring down both Sony's PlayStation Network and Microsoft's Xbox Live service . Reasoning: Kim Dotcom (above) said he would provide them with with free, lifetime vouchers for his new MegaPrivacy website designed to provide encrypted cloud-storage if they stopped the attack . All over: The group said on Friday they had stopped the attack . Many had thought the systems would be restored when the hackers made a deal with the very eccentric millionaire entrepreneur and gamer Kim Dotcom, who told them he would provide them with with free, lifetime vouchers for his new MegaPrivacy website designed to provide encrypted cloud-storage. And while Microsoft XBox was soon restored, PlayStation is not. Dotcom also made it clear he would cancel the vouchers if they shut down the network again, which it is unclear if they did or if it is still having difficulty getting back up following the attack. Lizard Squad claimed they could take down the NASDAQ if they wanted and that they ‘jokingly refer to themselves as terrorists’. They said that Microsoft was the easier of the two companies to take down as Sony had recently upgraded their systems. Asked about what protections the Xbox network had, Lizard Squad said: ‘Almost nothing.' In one of hundreds of similar messages, Andrew Quintero wrote: 'Could you guys please let PSN back on?' Others, such as London's Luca Rizzo, turned their anger on the companies, calling on them to improve security. He wrote: '@XboxSupport when is online going to be back on? This is a joke were missing out on xmas gaming because of a hack! We want answers!' Microsoft and Sony both used Twitter to acknowledge the issues and to assure users that they were doing everything they could to restore their services. At 2:30pm this afternoon, the Playstation's network was offline and, while many Xbox Live services were up and running, the service's status was described as 'limited'. On Boxing Day morning, Xbox support tweeted: 'Some Xbox One users may currently be experiencing issues signing into Xbox Live.' Around the same time, Playstation's support team posted: 'Our engineers are continuing to work hard to resolve the network issues users have experienced today. Thanks for your continued patience!' Lizard Squad first announced that it planned to take down the PlayStation Network and Xbox Live on Christmas Day in early December, describing itself as the 'next generation Grinch' Rival hacker group, The Finest Squad, claimed via Twitter on Christmas Day that they had restored Xbox Live . The hack left gamers unable to play online and also impacted online components of hugely popular games such as Call of Duty, Madden, FIFA and The Sims 4. Occasional downtime is par for the course for both services, but Christmas Day is a particularly bad time to be hacked, just as hundreds of thousands of PlayStation 4s and Xbox Ones were being unwrapped and set up for the first time. Lizard Squad had first announced earlier this month plans to take down the PlayStation Network and Xbox Live on Christmas Day. It described itself as the 'next generation Grinch.' Another hacker group, The Finest Squad, then emerged, saying that it would stop the group and bring its members to justice. The Finest Squad tweeted at about 5pm ET that they had Xbox 'pretty much restored.' The problems may have been exacerbated by Sony's decision to let consumers download the controversial movie The Interview through Xbox Video as well as other online sources. The hack left gamers unable to play online and also impacted online components of hugely popular games such as Call of Duty, Madden, FIFA and The Sims 4 . Microsoft used Twitter on Christmas Day to keep gamers updated about the issues impacting on Xbox Live . There was anger on Twitter today as parents and youngsters expressed fury at not being able to use their expensive Christmas presents properly. Wigan's Christine tweeted: 'Why hack Xbox & Playstation on Xmas day to stop kids playing with there presents....modern day Scrooge' Another website user added: 'Can't believe people have nothing better to do on Xmas than to hack into Xbox Live and play station network and shut them down' And IT tecnicial Jon Massey wrote: 'Cant figure out why they would hack Xbox + PSN. Way to spoil the Christmas for the kids who were lucky enough to get consoles...' Three Xbox platforms were affected by the service problem: Xbox One, Xbox 360 and Xbox on other devices, Microsoft's status website said. 'I have the nation on strings,' Lizard Squad wrote on its Twitter site. It also said it would put the sites back online if enough people retweeted its messages. Sony also used Twitter to keep PlayStation Network users abreast of the issues it was facing . Lizard Squad told WinBeta website it had taken down the PlayStation Network and Xbox Live 'for the laughs' but eventually found a cause to rally behind - forcing those companies to upgrade the security on their networks. Lizard Squad chose Christmas Eve and Christmas Day because it believed 'it would anger and reach the largest amount of people.' When asked if the group would consider addressing other targets, Lizard Squad said it 'could take down NASDAQ if they wanted to damage the economy,' but said that was not its goal. Lizard Squad said they would continue until the companies 'learned from their security issues.' In the past, Lizard Squad have overloaded both Microsoft and Sony's gameplay services, as well as Blizzard's online gaming network. Distributed denial-of-service attacks or DDoSing - occurs when massive numbers of people or automated machines flood servers with external data requests, crippling the computers to the point where they grind to a halt and are effectively frozen. This is what happened when Lizard Squad attacked the Blizzard and PlayStation Network servers in August. It is unclear exactly who or what Lizard Squad are or what they are demanding. The group communicates through Twitter - usually posting messages warning of upcoming attacks or flagging up current ones. Various reports suggest that the group is based in Russia - although this has not been proved. A link on the Lizard Squad Twitter page, leading to a chat room login - was originally Russian-based domain.","Gamers around the world were left disappointed on Christmas Day after Sony's PlayStation Network and Microsoft's Xbox Live service were hacked .

'It's remarkable that two different types of animal like a frog and snail can become great friends like this.' Wallace's flying frogs, also known as Abah River flying frog, are found from the Malay Peninsula into western Indonesia and are named after the biologist, Alfred R.

He said: 'Amazingly the snail wasn't phased by the frog trying to get on its back. They both wanted to play together it was really cute' As a type of moss frog, they can grow to between 80-100 mm and have long limbs, large eyes and eardrums. Its fingers and toes are webbed right to the tips and together with a fringe of skin stretching between the limbs, flying frogs can parachute to the forest floor from high in the trees where they are normally found. They have bright shiny green backs and their undersides are usually white to pale yellow with bright yellow on the outer parts of the toe and finger webbing. The species of giant African land snail, achatina fulica, is native to east Africa but it has been widely introduced to other parts of the world through the pet trade as a food resource and by accidental introduction. They feed voraciously and act as a vector for plant pathogens, causing severe damage to agricultural crops and native plants.

"Margaret Thatcher secretly feared that giving concessions to Irish republicans could trigger separatist demands from Asians in Britain . Margaret Thatcher secretly feared that giving concessions to Irish republicans could trigger separatist demands from Asians in Britain, official files reveal today. They show she fretted about the effect that appeasing nationalists in Northern Ireland – for example, relaxing the rules on flying flags – would have on other minorities in the UK. Speaking at an Irish peace-building summit 30 years ago, she said: ‘If these things were done, the next question would be what comes next? ‘Were the Sikhs in Southall to be allowed to fly their own flag?’ Southall, an Asian enclave in West London, became a hotbed of racial tensions in the 1970s. It was there that Blair Peach, an anti-racist campaigner, was killed after police knocked him unconscious during a protest against the National Front in 1979. It was also the scene of a notorious race riot in 1981. The late Baroness Thatcher told of her fears behind closed doors during her meeting with then Irish prime minister Garret FitzGerald for talks at Chequers in November 1984. She could not understand why Catholics in Northern Ireland were looking for certain rights and demanding reforms in policing, justice, equality and power-sharing. And she said there were minorities all over Europe who were not making the same sort of claims. The newly declassified files released by Dublin’s National Archives contain an official note of the two-hour Chequers summit that reveals Mrs Thatcher’s ‘incomprehension’ as to what exactly Irish nationalists wanted. The meeting was described as rapid and vigorous by those there. Mr FitzGerald, then leader of the Fine Gael party, explained that the minority felt they were Irish and a part of the majority of the island of Ireland ‘from which they had been cut off by an arbitrary act’. The British had drawn a line around the six counties, creating a Protestant majority, cutting off the minority from the nation and people were ‘set against each other within a narrow space,’ he said. He added there was ‘hard evidence’ of bias in the justice, security and policing systems in Northern Ireland while the guns of the British Army’s Ulster Defence Regiment were being used to ‘bully’ Catholics. The late Baroness Thatcher told of her fears behind closed doors during a meeting with Irish prime minister Garret FitzGerald . Mr FitzGerald warned Mrs Thatcher that she needed to deal with the alienation of northern nationalists. ‘They cannot fly the flag of their own nation in their own country,’ he said. But Mrs Thatcher insisted she could not understand why a minority would seek ‘particular prerogatives as of right’. Turning to Europe, she said Macedonians, Croats, Serbs and Sudeten Germans were minorities who had no special rights in their countries. But Mr FitzGerald rejected the comparisons. He asked his British counterpart where else in the world could one sixth of the population say they had relatives imprisoned. Mrs Thatcher mistakenly said there had been 2,500 deaths in the security forces, with Mr Fitz-Gerald correcting her that the majority were civilians, most of them Catholics.","Thatcher feared a deal with the Irish could lead to demands from Asians .

"The wills of more than 41million people, some dating back 156 years, are being published on the internet for the first time in a huge online archive. The database will allow households across the country to view the detailed legacies of past generations, and request copies of many documents that could previously only be accessed by a face-to-face request. As well as being able to find out about their own relatives’ histories, they will also be able to look up the wills of famous and influential people of the 19th and 20th centuries, including Sir Winston Churchill and Charles Dickens. The wills of more than 41million people are set to be published on the internet for the first time in a huge online archive (file picture) The wills, covering England and Wales and owned by Her Majesty’s Courts and Tribunals Service (HMCTS), were painstakingly scanned in by hand. Last year the handwritten wills of 280,000 First World War soldiers, many of whom died on the frontline, were made available online ahead of the centenary commemorations of the 1914-18 conflict. These generated two million searches as people sought to find clues to what roles their relatives played in the war. People will be able to access the last legacies of famous people including Charles Dickens and Sir Winston Churchill, pictured . The Government has already published wills and other probate materials dating from 1996 on the internet. Log on to www.gov.uk/search-will-probate and create an account. Choose the section you wish to search – Wills and Probate 1996 to present; Wills and Probate 1858 to 1996; or Soldiers’ Wills. There are two search fields – the surname of the deceased and year of death. Both must be filled in. You can also carry out an advanced search, which requires more information. In the 1996 to present section, a list of results will appear, giving the names, date of probate, probate number, date of death and registry of each person with that name. For instance, for a person called Stanley Wood who died in 2005, there are 12 results. To order a document, click ‘Add to basket’. Under the 1858 to 1996 section, a page from the probate calendar for that year is returned in search results, providing summaries of names, birthplace and other details. These must be typed into an online ordering form on the right of the screen. Click on ‘Proceed to checkout’ to pay. Some documents take up to ten days to be sent as electronic copies. The files can be accessed for 31 days. Now ministers have expanded the database to cover the years from 1858 – the year Probate Service records begin – to 1996. Including indexes and source documents, it is one of the country’s largest online resources, and will complement the public’s growing interest in genealogy. Despite a will being intensely personal, many people do not realise that it is, barring a few exceptions, a public document. Although they will not be able to read the wills at their computers for free, users of search the database at home and then buy copies for £10 each. Among the wills to be made available is that of Churchill, who left a fortune worth £304,004 – or more than £5.3million in today’s money. Alan Turing, the cryptologist who cracked the Enigma code to help bring the war to a close, committed suicide by cyanide poisoning in 1954. The brilliant mathematician left a short will with instructions to share his possessions between his colleagues and his mother. And Winnie the Pooh creator AA Milne gave shares of his future royalties and copyright to the Garrick Club, his favourite club, and Westminster School when he died in 1956. Courts Minister Shailesh Vara said: ‘This fascinating project provides insights into the ordinary and extraordinary people who helped shape this country, and the rest of the world. ‘It is a fantastic resource not only for family historians but also for anyone with an interest in social history.’ The original wills, many of them handwritten, are held in a secure facility on the outskirts of Birmingham, and the digital copies in a data centre in Milton Keynes.

"Surgery delay: Janine Gower lost her baby . When Janine Gower starred as an NHS nurse in the London Olympics opening ceremony, she took pride in representing what she regarded as a great national institution. Two years on, her pride has been replaced by embitterment. She is suing the Health Service, claiming that she nearly died when her ectopic pregnancy was misdiagnosed. Miss Gower, 29, was admitted to A&E after waking up in excruciating pain. She lost her baby – and says she almost died as well, after doctors failed to spot she was bleeding internally. She says the mistake meant she needed a transfusion after losing four pints of blood, and may have left her unable to have children. Miss Gower, an IT analyst for the Royal Free London NHS Trust, is suing for clinical neglect. ‘I work for the NHS. I know what good treatment is and what bad treatment is,’ she said. ‘It was terrifying. I don’t want anyone to go through what I have been through. The NHS faltered at every hurdle. They were completely negligent.’ Miss Gower was one of 600 NHS workers cast for the London Olympics’ tribute to the Health Service. She described the opening ceremony, in which she wore a nurse’s uniform, as ‘by far the most amazing experience of my life’. Earlier this year, she discovered she was pregnant but was told it was ectopic, meaning the child was developing outside the womb. Miss Gower, from Bushey, Hertfordshire, was given injections to stop the foetus growing and was told she would probably lose her baby, although she still had hopes it would survive. Scroll down for video . Tribute: Miss Gower, pictured second from left, representing the NHS at the Olympic opening ceremony . In May, six weeks after the initial diagnosis, she woke up in excruciating pain and returned to Northwick Park hospital in Harrow, North-West London. Miss Gower spent more than eight hours drifting in and out of consciousness and lost her baby. She was initially told the foetus was in her cervix rather than one of her fallopian tubes – a misdiagnosis which led to crucial delays in her treatment. One of her fallopian tubes had in fact ruptured, and needed to be removed. Miss Gower says the operation was only performed after midnight, ten hours after she arrived. She adds that her chances of becoming pregnant again have been reduced as a result. Miss Gower, who recently split from her partner, has hired solicitors to sue the NHS for a payout which would fund IVF treatment, in case she needs help to conceive again. ‘I lost half the blood in my body ... I was in shock for weeks after,’ she said. ‘I started to get better and then I started to have emotional problems. I felt very low.’ A hospital investigation has conceded there was a critical delay between 7pm and 10.30pm, when she should have been operated on following her re-admission to hospital. Miss Gower, who was admitted to Northwick Park hospital, pictured, in Harrow, North-West London, says she almost died after doctors failed to spot she was bleeding internally . Carole Flowers, Northwick Park’s director of nursing, has apologised for the ‘anxiety and trauma’ Miss Gower suffered. She said the doctor who treated her ‘would like to offer profuse apologies’. David Weston, of London North West Healthcare NHS Trust, said: ‘We have responded in full and apologised for the upset caused to the patient.’","Janine Gower, 29, is suing the health service for clinical neglect .

"One of the country’s biggest rail terminals will be ‘effectively closed’ today because of over-running engineering works. There will be no trains in or out of King’s Cross in London due to delays to Network Rail works north of the station. The disruption comes on one of the busiest travel days of the year, as thousands of people try to return home after visiting family for Christmas. Scroll down for video . Services in and out of London Kings Cross station have been cancelled today, it has been announced . Frustration: Travellers at the London station, one of the busiest in the country, where services are cancelled . The disruptions at the station, which is managed by Network Rail, will affect those planning to travel on East Coast, First Hull Trains, Grand Central and Great Northern services. East Coast Trains made the announcement on its website yesterday evening, where it advised passengers to delay their travel if possible. It also said that a revised timetable is currently being developed and will be made available as soon as possible. Customers have been advised they need to start or finish their journey at Finsbury Park in north London, with at least one change of train because of the overrun works in the Holloway area. A reduced service to and from the station will go ahead as planned on Sunday, with trains  leaving up to 20 minutes earlier than normal from King's Cross. Last night Passenger Focus, the independent watchdog, described the delays as ‘frustrating’. East Coast made the announcement on their website and apologised for disruption on what is 'an already very busy travel day immediately following the Christmas break' They follow years of complaints from passengers that Britain’s railways effectively ‘shut down’ over the Christmas and New Year holiday. The chaos is heightened by the fact that the West Coast Main Line is already closed for engineering works over the Christmas period. The route is shut between London Euston and Hemel Hempstead in Hertfordshire until Monday, and also closed between Stafford and Crewe until Sunday. Last night travellers vented their frustration with the King’s Cross closure on social media, saying Network Rail had ‘explaining to do’. The station is the southern terminus of the East Coast Main Line, which provides services to major cities including Leeds, Newcastle and Edinburgh. East Coast spokesman, Paul Emberley, said: 'Network Rail has apologised to passengers for the inevitable delays to their travel plans on Saturday as a result of the overrunning engineering works. 'East Coast is particularly sorry too for the inconvenience to its customers as a result, on what we know is an already very busy travel day immediately following the Christmas break. Sources said that the station would effectively be closed  due to delays to works north of the station . 'For customers intending to start or finish their journey at King's Cross, consideration should be given to deferring travel plans to either Sunday or Monday. 'We're working hard over the holiday period to make the necessary adjustments to our timetable as a consequence, and to provide as much information as we can.' National Rail said on its website that services to and from King's Cross would be 'significantly disrupted' tomorrow. It said there will be no trains before 10am tomorrow and over the weekend, many trains will start or terminate at Doncaster, Peterborough, Stevenage or Finsbury Park. Meanwhile, First Hull Trains will run two trains in each direction each day to and from London St Pancras International instead of London Kings Cross. Great Northern are diverting some trains to and from Moorgate between 8.30am and 7.30pm. It said:  'A revised timetable is currently being developed and will be made available as soon as possible. Please check our website regularly for updates. 'Passengers travelling to and from central London may use London Underground services between Finsbury Park and central London. Customers will need to start or finish their journey at Finsbury Park in north London, with at least one change of train, according to East Coast Trains . 'Buses will run between London Kings Cross and Finsbury Park when there is no train or London Underground service.' The rail company said that the work was part of a £200 million Christmas investment programme. It is one of 300 projects being undertaken over the holidays across 2,000 sites up and down the country by some 11,000 railway engineers. A spokesman said: 'What has happened is really regrettable and unfortunate, but it is a small part of a massive amount of engineering investment taking place over Christmas.' The spokesman added that 4.5 million passengers use the railways on average every day, compared with two million a day over the holidays. The company confirmed the disruption at around 8.30pm on its Twitter page - hours after it was first announced by East Coast Trains, which said: 'No service between Kings Cross & Finsbury Park tom due to track work in the Holloway area which has taken longer then expected. Apologies.' Hundreds were forced to take to the roads yesterday after rail services were virtually non-existent today . A reduced service will also operate to and from the terminal on Sunday as planned, with journeys possibly being re-timed or taking longer than expected, according to Network Rail. David Sidebottom, passenger director at the independent watchdog Passenger Focus, said: 'Investment in maintenance and improvement is necessary, and we passengers understand that. 'But overrunning works that disrupt already-limited festive travel are frustrating. 'Our research is clear: passengers want to be kept on the train wherever possible, they want to know before buying a ticket if part of the journey will be by bus, and they want plenty of staff on hand to signpost where to go and what to do. 'We will be looking to see that operators and Network Rail are doing all in their power to alert passengers, to help them make alternative arrangements and to make it easy for them to claim refunds or compensation.' Several frustrated passengers have taken to Twitter to vent their anger. Liam Gladdy said: 'Something must have gone very, very wrong for @networkrail at Kings Cross if they're looking at overrunning by 2 days for 2 days work.' While Amelie Soleil wrote: 'Ahhh what's that? All trains are cancelled coming though Kings Cross tomorrow. Brilliant. Nice to see that £200 train ticket was worth it.' Emily Clifton said: 'Trains all cancelled from King's Cross tomorrow literally what am i supposed to do,' while another user said 'The UK are so unprepared. Today it's just like 'Oh, by the way, we're closing King's Cross for a few days.' It comes after a day of travel disruption on the railways as every single major artery in Britain was closed on Boxing Day. Trains between England and Scotland or Wales on the East Coast, West Coast or Great Western mainlines - and the Midland, Cross Country and East Anglia lines remained shut yesterday. The near-non-existent Boxing Day service has returned this year despite a fierce political battle over the shutdown dating back to at least 2007. Labour and Tories have repeatedly traded accusations over the lack of service, which affects football fans, families without cars and shop workers in the Boxing Day sales. Apart from airport shuttles and Eurostar, only Chiltern, Scotrail, Southeastern and Southern ran trains yesterday. A Department for Transport spokesman said: ‘Network Rail and train companies have ensured that a large part of the railway will remain open during the Christmas/New Year period and alternative routes are provided where lines are closed.’","East Coast, First Hull Trains, Grand Central and Great Northern lines hit .

"Robert F. Kennedy Jr. will admit to a relationship with a Connecticut socialite if forced to testify in court, DailyMail.com has learned. Legal papers disclose that he is to be questioned over whether he played a part in the breakdown of the marriage of Chelsea Kirwan and her last plastic surgeon husband, Laurence. The papers Mrs Kirwan says that he will deny an affair during the marriage. But DailyMail.com has learned that if he is questioned over whether they subsequently became lovers, he will admit to it. The Kennedy scion, who married actress Cheryl Hines in August, is to be questioned under oath as part of the bitter divorce between the couple. Scroll down for video . Mr & Mrs Kennedy: RFK Jr. and his wife Cheryl Hines at the RFK Ripple of Hope gala in NYC on Tuesday, December 16 . Close friendship: Chelsea Kirwan, pictured in June outside her local gym in Bedford, New York, is believed to have had a friendship with Bobby Kennedy Jr. that spanned two years . He and Mrs Kirwan became friends before the collapse of her marriage but there have been persistent claims the relationship was intimate. Neither has publicly confirmed or denied whether she was cheating on her husband. Dr Kirwan’s lawyers have filed a motion to depose Kennedy, 60, in California. However, Mrs Kirwan's lawyers argued at Stamford Superior court in Connecticut on Monday that Kennedy should NOT be deposed, saying it is merely a measure to 'harass, embarrass, oppress and annoy' her. And, they added, Kennedy's testimony is 'immaterial to the issues before this court'. Court papers for Mrs Kirwan obtained by DailyMail.com - and which she is legally compelled to treat as a statement of truth - go on to reveal: 'The actions of Dr Kirwan which led up to his wife's filing for divorce are well known by him and have nothing to do with any alleged affair by the wife with anyone, much less the proposed deponent.' Separately a source with knowledge of the case said that Kennedy would admit to a sexual relationship after the end of the Kirwans' marriage if questioned under oath - as Dr Kirwan's lawyers are expected to. As part of the legal argument to get Kennedy's deposition banned, the court papers state it is an attempt to subject anyone 'directly or indirectly connected' with her, by 'subjecting such persons to examination about their personal lives under oath and speculating about such details in the media'. As previously reported, Dr Kirwan, 62, was aware that his former wife had enjoyed a close friendship with Kennedy. A source told DailyMail.com: ‘Laurence was well aware that his wife and Bobby had a friendship before their split and that they have had ongoing telephone calls.’ Estranged: Surgeon to the stars Laurence Kirwan and his soon to be ex wife Chelsea at a party. Sources close to Prof Kirwan claimed the mother of three of his children had an 'inappropriate' relationship with Robert F Kennedy Jr. Compelling: Chelsea Kirwan's lawyers are making a legal bid to challenge Robert F. Kennedy Jr's. deposition in her divorce case. They state if called to testify, he will say a relationship started only AFTER Mrs Kirwan filed for divorce . Kennedy, who this month was seen hobnobbing with his wife Cheryl Hines, potential 2016 Presidential candidate Hillary Clinton and his mother Ethel Kennedy at the RFK Ripple Of Hope Gala at the Hilton Hotel in Manhattan, allegedly had a two-year 'affair' with Mrs Kirwan, 42, which was reported earlier this year. Soon after the news became public, a source said Kennedy was set to be questioned under oath as part of the Kirwans' divorce case, saying: 'Chelsea fears Laurence’s lawyers want to discredit her as a wife and a mom.' The pair were also pictured together at an event in Seattle in April 2013, where Bobby feted mountaineer Jim Whittaker. And she is believed to have accompanied him around the country. Mrs Kirwan filed for divorce in 2012. Dr Kirwan's lawyers want to ascertain whether the friendship started during the Kirwans' marriage - and what the exact nature of the friendship was.

He was married to Emily Black between 1982 until 1994 and they had two children. His second wife, Mary Richardson Kennedy - the mother of four of his children - killed herself in May 2012. And asked about their relationship, Cheryl said: 'We share the same values. Family first. We like to have a good time and work hard. It’s fun to have a partner...It’s a good match-up.'

"Long before the rise of Google, people seeking information on various subjects looked to the New York Public Library for answers. The formidable institution, founded in 1895 and boasting a collection of nearly 53million items, had accumulated a substantial archive of reference questions dating from 1940s to 1980s. The library has been sharing some of the most amusing and curious items in their files on NYPL's Instagram account. Ask, and you shall receive: Long before the rise of Google, people seeking information on various subjects looked to the New York Public Library for answers . Two-part question: On New Year's Day in 1967, a woman with a 'somewhat uncertain voice’ called the library asking how to locate a multi-millionaire she had met, and whether or not she should write someone  a thank-you note . Some of the yellowed, neatly typed or handwritten cards contain answers to the queries, dates and even names. For people who grew up with Google, it is nearly impossible to imagine a time when in order to find out the lifespan of an eyelash, or whether mice can throw up, one would have had to pick up the phone and call their library. The questions in the reference cards the NYPL shared in advance with Gothamist run the gamut from the utilitarian to the hilarious and the downright absurd. In 1946, NYPL staffers were asked whether it was acceptable to use DDT on a mouse roaming the kitchen. In a note penned in 1963, a person inquired where one could rent a beagle for hunting. One person wanted to know if an octopus can be kept as a pet, while another asked the library to recommend a good forger. Inquisitive minds: The library accumulated a substantial archive of reference questions dating from 1940s to 1980s running the gamut from the utilitarian to the absurd . On the web: The library has been sharing some of the most amusing and curious items in their files on NYPL's Instagram account . A particularly enigmatic note written by one 'Max Nodifference' stated that its author is stuck 'trying to solve the riddle of existence.' But most of the questions in the archive are more prosaic in nature: ‘how do you put up wallpaper?’ or ‘are black widow spiders more harmful dead or alive?’ One person approached the library asking what is the best glass to use in his greenhouse in Cuba; another caller was curious about the difference between pig and pork. Among the piles of reference cards scrawled with questions and replies are a few real gems, like the one about whether Plato, Aristotle and Socrates were the same person, or the whether Jules Verne wrote Alice in Wonderland. Old-timey search engine: For people who grew up with Google, it is hard to imagine a time when in order to find out a piece of information one would have to head off to the library . Slipping into the murky realm of psychoanalysis, one inquisitive New Yorker asked librarians to explain what does it mean when you dream of being chased by an elephant. A couple of the queries were of historical nature, one of them inquiring after the fate of Lee Harvey Oswald's infamous rifle, and the other asking to clarify Bible’s copyright status.

The first query pertained to rules of etiquette: whether or not she needs to send a thank-you note to the hosts of a New Year's Eve party where she’d ended up spending the night. The second part of the question touched upon the matters of the heart. 'When you meet a fellow and you know he’s worth twenty-seven million dollars... and you know his nationality, how do you find out his name?'

"With tins of formula milk filling the cupboards, bottles galore and a sterilising unit permanently in use, this nursery is no different from thousands of others across the country. Jars of Sudocrem for nappy rash are dotted about, there’s a changing mat and plenty of fresh nappies. But as new mum Kate Diver nurses her little charge, gently winding him after a meal and rubbing Bonjela into his aching gums as he teethes, it’s clear this is no ordinary baby. Instead, Bulu Mata is an orphaned 12-week-old orangutan, brought into Monkey World in Dorset earlier this month after his mother suddenly died from intestine problems a week after his birth in Budapest Zoo. Scroll down for video . Baby love: Bulu Mata snuggles into his favourite blue blanket at Monkey World where staff hope he will be adopted by another orangutan . Head of Apes, Kate, 32, is one of a team of four staff currently nursing the little lad, whose name means ‘long eyelashes’ in Indonesian, round the clock. But looking through the window with interest at this quaint scene is a far more important woman. It’s Hsaio-qua, an 18-year-old orangutan who’s been at the rescue centre since she was abandoned outside a Taiwan amusement park aged five. Staff hope she will soon take over their duties and become the baby ape’s mum. She’s been chosen because her maternal instinct is so strong: she’s had two sons of her own and, three years ago, adopted a tiny female called Awan, who had been abandoned by her mother. As soon as she saw the baby’s plight, she stepped in and swept the little one up into her arms. But now Awan is three-and-a-half and staff feel her adoptive mum is ready for another challenge. They’ve introduced them and Hsaio-qua showed some interest, touching and sniffing the new baby, but she’s yet to pick him up and take him as her own like she did with Awan. ‘We’re really confident she will love Bulu Mata,’ says Alison Cronin, director of Monkey World. ‘He’s got everything he needs to bring out the nurturing instinct in her — huge eyes, cute little wriggles.’ Swinging in: Bulu Mata is given a helping hand as he takes his first baby steps (left) and chewing on a teething ring to help soothe sore gums . Indeed he has. As I watch him — I can’t get too close because I’ve got a cold and his small lungs make him vulnerable to infection — I, too, fall in love with this special little creature with his soft ginger fur, long arms and huge, gummy smile. Now seven pounds, he’s already trying to push himself up to stand. To encourage him, staff regularly hold his fingers and help him ‘walk’ a few baby steps. It’s vital he builds up his strength so that, when he is finally adopted, he can hold on tight to his new mum as she whirls around the trees, high above the ground, in her enclosure. When he’s not trying to stand up or sleep (like most babies this is his major occupation), he plays with the teething ring above the baby mat he lies on, eyes darting round his little nursery. Monkey business: The 12-week-old orangutan snuggles up close to carer Kate Diver, who wears a specially-made orange jacket with tassels that mimic orangutan fur so he learns how to hold on to his new mother tightly . But Bulu Mata’s eyes can’t yet focus properly and the experts at Monkey World believe this is why he hasn’t yet bonded with Hsaio-qua. In the next few weeks, as he develops, this will happen naturally. Then, says Alison, it’s a ‘done deal’. ‘All he needs to do is look at Hsaio-qua and reach out his hand,’ she explains. ‘She’s so maternal, she won’t be able to resist. ‘It will make all the difference to his life. He’s missing out on so much. The only long-term relationship orangutans ever have is between a mother and her baby. It’s vital he grows up with primates of his own kind, otherwise he will find it hard to fit in.’ Normally, orangutan babies stay with mum for seven years — the longest childhood of any ape — picking up the skills they need to survive and get on with other primates. In their first year, they never leave their mother’s side. Staff worry that if Bulu Mata isn’t adopted, he’ll fixate on one of his carers, not learn how to socialise with his own kind and never be accepted by the other 17 orangutans in the centre. It’s why he has four people looking after him, not just one — to lessen the risk. And if anyone knows what’s best for him, it’s Monkey World. It looks after 250 orphaned, abandoned and rescued primates and has Europe’s only monkey crèche, which currently contains six baby orangutans. Set up in Wareham in 1987 by Jim Cronin — Alison’s husband who died in 2007 of liver cancer — it receives no Government grants, instead relying on donations and entrance fees. The baby orangutans and their mothers live in a building with a playroom kitted out with climbing frames, hammocks and ropes to encourage and teach them how to swing through trees. There’s also a half-acre outdoor enclosure filled with trees and climbing frames. Bulu Mata is too small to go in this gym, but he can watch the goings-on, and learn orangutan behaviour through a window. Once he’s bonded with Hsaio-qua — the name means ‘good little girl’ in Chinese — it’s where they’ll spend the next few months. They met on his second day at Monkey World. Bulu Mata was laid in a small tunnel next to his potential mum’s bedroom then she was let in. She went straight over and touched him but, much to the keepers’ disappointment, didn’t immediately sweep him up to her breast. ‘We hoped Hsaio-qua would just stroll in and say: “Baby,” ’ Alison admits. Instead they let her visit him every day in the same way — keeping the visits ‘short and sweet’ so she doesn’t get bored. Until he’s adopted, Bulu Mata’s days start at 8.15am when he leaves the on-site house where he’s spent the night with whichever carer is on duty and is carried to the nursery. There, he is fed formula milk by bottle every four hours, although he’s expected to be weaned onto baby rice then pureed fruit and vegetables in the next few weeks. Bulu Mata, one of the ‘critically endangered’ Sumatran orangutans of whom there are only 7,000 left in the wild, gets around by clinging to his carers. They wear a specially-made orange jacket with tassels that mimic orangutan fur so he learns how to hold on to mum tightly — nobody wants him falling when she’s swinging from tree to tree. ‘He clings on so tight that peeling him off is really hard work,’ says Kate Diver. ‘I tie my hair back but he still sometimes manages to grab some and when he does, it really hurts. He’s got a vice-like grip. ‘But he’s such a cheerful little chap — he’s got the most gorgeous temperament, very laid back and gentle. He never whinges and only cries when he’s seriously hungry. Potential parent: Hsiao-quai cuddles up to three-year-old female orangutan, Awan, who she adopted after she was abandoned by her mother . ‘After feeding, I have to wind him. I change his nappies, too — he’s so tiny he’s in premature baby nappies. They’re necessary because he doesn’t have a mum to keep him clean and away from any mess. ‘Then I put on the nappy cream — just like with a human baby. He’s starting to teethe so I put Bonjela on his gums to try and ease any pain. The only thing I can’t do is shin up trees the way his mum would have done.’ Even so, Kate knows human care is second best and can’t wait for Hsaio-qua to step up to the mark. ‘We all adore him but he doesn’t need us — he needs a mum,’ she says. ‘If we can achieve that, we will have given him the best gift in the world.’","Bulu Mata, whose name means 'long eyelashes' in Indonesian, is currently being nursed at Monkey World in Dorset .

"Islamic State fighters who have returned from the conflict in Iraq and Syria are living in Queensland, but are being 'closely monitored' by officials. Australia is currently facing a 'high' threat of terrorism according to the government, with a number of Islamic State extremists currently on the ASIO anti-terrorism radar.

Scroll down for video . Fighters from the Islamic State  during a parade in Raqqa. It is believed fighters from the Islamic State are now living in Australia . A senior Police Commissioner has warned that the experience these fighters have gained from the conflict in makes them a major concern for Australian authorities . When asked about the number of extremists living in Australia, Queensland Police Commissioner Ian Stewart said 'I can't confirm the number because it can change in a heartbeat – and the risk can change in a heartbeat. Today it (the number) might be five. Tomorrow it might be 10,'. 'Obviously you don't go off fighting in foreign lands – not as a member of the Australian Defence Force – and come back and think you are not going to be on our radar,' Mr Stewart said. 'And that's because of the experiences that they have, and the skill set that they pick up by being involved in fighting elsewhere.' Mr Stewart said while the Police strive for the utmost safety of Australians, there is always a risk of acts of terror. Queensland Police Commissioner Ian Stewart would not confirm the number of extremists living in Australia . It is believed that 12 Queenslanders are among the 70 identified Australians fighting in Iraq and Syria. Some of them are hiding in Syria, fearing if they come back to Australia they will be prosecuted by severe new anti-terror laws that could see them jailed for up to 25 years. Among the Australians who have flown to Syria are brothers Taha, Hamza, Bilal and Omar from Yagoona in Western Sydney.

"A man shed a quarter of his body weight after he was jokingly nicknamed 'Fatboy' by friends during a trip up one of Britain's highest mountains. Dave Burn, from Essex, who weighed 18st, was attempting to scale Mount Snowdon in Wales with friends to celebrate his 45th birthday but he had to give up just a third of the way up the 3,500 peak - and took the train to the top instead. Despite his early cop out, Dave, now 49, was so exhausted he slept through his birthday night out and was unable to drive home the next day due to aches and pains in his legs - and on his return had to take four days off work. Dave Burn, pictured, left, now, and, right, at his heaviest attempting to climb Mount Snowdon, has shed four stone after overhauling his lifestyle . Dave recalled: 'We took a photo of me at the top and the lads called me Fatboy Snowdon. That night all I could do was sleep, I missed my birthday night out, and the next day my friend had to drive the car home as my legs were killing me.' As a result of the incident, he vowed to get fit, cut out the takeaways and he enrolled on an annual week-long boot camp in Marbella. Since then he has completed 10k races in England, Ireland, Scotland and Wales, the London to Paris bike ride and even trekked to the base camp of Mount Everest. He has shed four stone, dropped from a XXXL clothes size to a large and lost ten inches from his waistline - and vowed never to get overweight again. Dave, from Barking in Essex, who has three children and one grandchild, said: 'When I look back I really hated who I was before. But now, I'm happy in my skin. I had to declare war on Fatboy Snowdon and that I was going to win.'

Dave, who is married to Wendy, 45, and father to Ronnie, 26, Mikayla, 22, and Leigh, 20, and has a two-year-old granddaughter called Maycee, overhauled his diet too. He said: 'Before I went to boot camp I didn't have a clue about nutrition and I was a mess. I remember looking at the trainer, Iain Reitze, who is the same age as me and just wanting to feel good. 'As well as the sessions, he educated us about the right foods to fuel our body and make us feel better physically and emotionally too.' Before his lifestyle overhaul, Dave would have a fry-up for breakfast, followed by a chocolate bar as a snack, then a sandwich and crisps for lunch. 'He would then have a Mars bar or a French stick to keep him going in the afternoon and either a Chinese or Indian takeaway or a kebab for dinner. Now, he has porridge for breakfast, an apple mid-morning, chicken salad for lunch, a banana mid-afternoon then chicken, tofu or even just vegetables for dinner. Dave said: 'I learned to eat well every two hours or so rather than having rubbish. A few years back, if you'd said I'd be eating tofu, I'd have fallen over laughing. But now I like it and some nights we have just steamed veg for dinner and I still feel satisfied.

"Thousands of older people are stuck in large family homes and unable to downsize because of a ‘chronic shortage’ of retirement housing, experts claim. The idea that they are adding to a housing shortage for younger generations by stubbornly refusing to move out is a myth, according to Saga. The firm, which provides services for the over-50s, said many retirees wanted to buy more practical accommodation but were prevented by a lack of choice. Saga, which provides services for the over-50s, said many retirees wanted to buy more practical accommodation rather than stay in the family home but were prevented by a lack of choice . The news comes as a report by Knight Frank urged house builders to focus on providing attractive accommodation for pensioners to offset a potential care home crisis. The estate agent warned that the ageing population could be forced into care homes unnecessarily if more flexible retirement housing was not built. It said this should include ‘aspirational’ accommodation resembling ‘five-star hotels’ with spas, pools, gyms, manicured gardens and several restaurants. Meanwhile, a Saga survey of 10,000 over-50s found almost half would consider moving into more appropriate housing in retirement, rather than stay in their large family house. A fifth said they would move to provide money for a retirement free of financial worries, while one in 14 said they wanted to release money to help their families. Saga said more people would consider ‘rightsizing’ – moving into a home that suited their retirement needs better – if appropriate housing was available. The survey found that almost three-quarters of these wanted something more practical rather than simply smaller. Of those who would consider a move, half would look into buying a bungalow and a quarter would consider a purpose-built retirement apartment. Only one in ten said that being close to relatives was important when looking for a home in retirement. Estate agent Knight Frank has warned that the ageing population could be forced into care homes unnecessarily if more flexible retirement housing was not built (file picture) Lisa Harris, head of communications for Saga, said: ‘Older homeowners are more than willing to consider rightsizing as they approach retirement and have thrown down the gauntlet to developers to build housing with them in mind.’ Knight Frank found Britain was failing to encourage people to downsize because of a lack of retirement housing. Tens of thousands of older people would be able to maintain their independence for longer if there was more ‘supported housing’ in attractive retirement villages which they ‘aspired’ to move to, it said. This would free up larger homes for younger families. The firm found that less than 1 per cent of private housing being built was for the elderly, warning this was not enough for an ageing population. The number of over-65s in the UK is set to double to 20million in 30 years. Just 1 per cent of Britain’s over-60s live in retirement communities, compared to 17 per cent in the US and 13 per cent in Australia and New Zealand. Emma Cleugh, head of institutional consultancy at Knight Frank, said: ‘The Government should be urged to support far more progressively the needs of older people in terms of high quality housing, care and an aspirational lifestyle.’ Official figures show three-quarters of people aged 60 and over own their own home, compared with less than a third of those aged 25 to 34.","Saga said many retirees would like to buy more practical accommodation .

"This shocking video shows the moment a volunteer fireman tied a stray dog to his car by a rope and dragged it through the city to 'teach the animal a lesson for biting his son'. Paco, five, was left with four broken legs and ripped holes in the bottom of his paws after struggling to stay on his feet as the car sped through the streets of Salamanca de Monterrico in Central Peru. He also suffered internal injuries because the man kicked him several times before setting off and dragging him under several cars. Scroll down for video .

When questioned by police, driver Jose Percy Chiroque Chacon, 45, allegedly claimed that the dog had bitten his son and said he wanted to punish him. He said he had grabbed the dog and tied it by a rope to his SUV before heading off round the town at high speed, according to media reports. Paco was saved when local residents spotted the abuse and blockaded Chacon's car, forcing him to stop.

Driver Jose Percy Chiroque Chacon, 45, (pictured) allegedly claimed that the dog had bitten his son and said he wanted to punish him . Chacon said he had grabbed the dog and tied it by a rope to his SUV before heading off round the town at high speed . Outraged neighbours in Salamanca de Monterrico have protested against Chacon's actions, saying the dog is loved in the community and has never bitten anyone else in the past. One neighbour said: 'Everybody around here knows Paco, he is really friendly and that's why he gets fed a lot and hangs around. Nobody has ever heard of him biting anybody and we very much doubt he bit the man's son.' The Volunteer Fire Department of Peru revealed that Chacon joined the volunteer unit in 2001 and passed the exam in 2003. General Commander Gonzalo Lostaunau Silva said the man's actions do not represent the oath firemen take and contradict the values the service men stand for.

"Dressed from head to toe in a Father Christmas outfit, a Palestinian man is shown throwing a tear gas capsule at Israeli security forces today. The violence was part of a protest against the separation barrier and Jewish settlement construction at Bil'in Village, in Ramallah, in the West Bank of Jerusalem. Elsewhere, a knife-wielding Palestinian man wounded two Israeli border police officers at the entrance to Jerusalem's Old City. The attacker stabbed an officer in the neck and wounded the other at the Lion's Gate in east Jerusalem, before fleeing. The stabbing is the latest in a string of Palestinian attacks in recent months against Israelis that have included deadly assaults with guns, knives and vehicles. The Palestinian man in the Father Christmas costume was pictured throwing a tear gas capsule . The violence was part of a protest against the separation barrier and Jewish settlement construction at Bil'in Village, in Ramallah, in the West Bank of Jerusalem . The violence on Boxing Day was part of a string of Palestinian attacks in recent months against Israelis . The violence is largely down to the dispute over the holy site in Jerusalem revered by Jews as the Temple Mount and by Muslims as the Noble Sanctuary and the site of Al Aqsa Mosque. Israeli security officials have suggested the attacks are not carried out on the orders of any group or organisation. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel has accused President Mahmoud Abbas of the Palestinian Authority of encouraging violence after he urged Muslims to defend the Jerusalem holy site 'by all means.' Yesterday, a fire bomb left an 11-year old Israeli girl is fighting for her life after it was thrown at her parents' car. Ayala Shapira, from the settlement of Matan, was hit in the face and suffered third-degree burns on her body after the car was set ablaze, the Israeli daily newspaper Haaretz reported. 'Ayala screamed that her seat belt was stuck,' said her father, Avner Shapira, who was also injured in the attack. 'I yelled at her to get out, and she finally managed. I don't know if she extracted herself, or if the seat belt burned. With the help of God, we were saved.' Doctors said the girl's recovery will take months, and that she will need facial reconstruction.

"Arrested: Edward Venteroso, 46, held a 55-year-old woman prisoner in her own home while he assaulted her with a cast-iron pan and prevented her from seeking medical assistance, police said . A Colorado man kept a 55-year-old woman prisoner in her own rural home while he assaulted her with a cast-iron pan and prevented her from seeking medical assistance, police said. Edward Venteroso, 46, was arrested after deputies discovered he had imprisoned Kathy Harris for two days in her home on the outskirts of Durango. The Durango Herald reports that La Plata County Sheriff's deputies responded to an emergency call around 7 a.m. Wednesday. When the door to the house was opened, Harris fell to the ground bloody and nearly unconscious, begging for help from police. The deputies arrested Venteroso, who had allegedly entered Harris's home on Tuesday and kept her locked in the house and unable to seek medical care while he assaulted her. Police say he also damaged Harris's phone in order to keep the woman from calling 911. La Plata County Sheriff's spokesperson Lt Dan Bender said she was transported to Mercy Regional Medical Center with head and ear injuries, including some caused by a cast-iron frying pan. Venteroso had reportedly been living on Harris's property, but had a protection order against him stemming from a previous assault against Harris. Venteroso was charged with first-degree assault, violation of a protection order, false imprisonment and obstructing telephone service and he remains in custody Friday on $25,000 bond.","Edward Venteroso, 46, imprisoned 55-year-old Kathy Harris in her home .

"As people across Australia relaxed after a day of festive over indulgence, one man was enduring perhaps the most miserable Christmas Day ever after becoming stranded on his jetski in the middle of a lake. The 28-year-old experienced jetskier had set off for a simple 4.5km ride on Lake Hume on the Victorian/New South Wales border, near his hometown of Albury, when his Christmas day went drastically wrong. The man’s friends become worried and reported him missing to police after he failed to return from the 15-minute ride by 8.00pm after setting off at 6.30pm. Lake Hume Coast Guard set out to rescue the man on Boxing Day after he was located after spending 12 hours on the lake overnight .

"Camden, New Jersey, has long been one of the most dangerous places in America, but recent police cuts combined with the highest unemployment rate in New Jersey have made the city even deadlier. This year there have been 39 murders in the city of 77,000 -- on pace to break the all-time record set in 1995. In 2011, the murder rate was ten times than that of New York City and 30 percent higher than New Orleans, Louisiana, the most dangerous large city in the nation. Squalor: The crumbling residential buildings of Camden have become a war zone of drug dealers and pimps . Streets of terror: A Camden police officer pats down a suspect. There were 13 homicides in the New Jersey city last month . Run down: Crack houses have sprung up amid the boarded-up factories and burned out houses . Camden was once a bustling industrial . town but drugs and alcohol abuse now run rife in an area that is . economically deprived. More than half of all children live below the poverty line. The city finds itself in the midst of . a drug war as unemployed young men with nothing to lose battle for . territory across the city. Large gang networks are competing with local drug deals and the results of always violent. Last month, 27-year-old Robert . Carstarphen was shot dead in an alley during a fight over drug dealing . territory between members of the Bloods street gang. The following day, . two more men were dead after a retaliation hit. The deaths brought the total number . of homicides for July to 13 - making the month the city's worst since . September 1949 when mass murderer Howard Unruh left the same number dead . in a shooting spree. One resident said: 'We don't have any real policing in Camden. They're just out here to pick up the bodies' Abject poverty: The unemployment rate in Camden skyrocketed from less than 9 percent to more than 20 percent during the recession. It has only fallen less than two percentage points doing the recovery . Abandoned: These homes are a health and safety risk, with many of them simply uninhabitable . Last year, there were 50 murders in . Camden, eight short of the record of 58 homicides in 1995. Most of the . murder victims this year were male, with the youngest a 16-year-old boy . and the eldest a 42-year-old woman. The . murder rate has been spurred on by massive cuts to a police force that . had already been dogged by corruption and too few resources. Thanks to massive state budget cuts . to poor cities like Camden, Newark and Trenton, the Camden Police . Department was forced to fire 168 officers in 2011 -- more than one . third of its police force. 'Many organizations had layoffs. In one day, we had a decimation,' Police Chief Scott Thomson told the Newark Star-Ledger. Depressing: Camden in New Jersey is now a sad shadow of its former self . Neighbourhood: People are scarcely seen on the city's streets which have become the second most dangerous in the U.S. Drop: The population has plummeted by more than 40 per cent from its 1950 level of 120,000 . As a result, arrests fell to less . than half what they were in 2009 -- when the city looked like it was . bringing the crime epidemic under control. According to the AroundPhilly blog on Yahoo, one . resident said: 'We don't have any real policing in Camden. They're just . out here to pick up the bodies.' Camden was once a major hub of manufacturing, with large plants from General Electric and RCA employing tens of thousands of workers. As those factories left, nothing replaced them and the city fell into ruin. Devastated: Many houses have simply been left to rack and ruin . Former glories: Echoes of a previous time are evident everywhere you go in Camden . Filthy: The stench of sewage permeates the run-down streets . In the last decade, crack houses have . sprung up amid the boarded-up factories and burned out houses. People . live in fear of being robbed or shot as addicts roam the streets looking . to fund their habit. Most of the killings were gang members . involved in drugs although there were innocent victims including a . 39-year-old father of six who attempted to break up a fight. In the . 39 murder cases, charges had been filed in 17, according to police. There were 103 shootings in total from January to July this year. Camden has long been the poorest city in New Jersey, but the recession has made things worse -- and the situation is not improving. The unemployment rate was less than 9 percent in 2007. In may, it stood at 18 percent, leaving thousands of young men out of work and with few alternatives. Members of the local clergy have been . taking part in anti-violence walks on the streets to try to build . relationships and ease tension among the disenfranchised and the . vulnerable. Young people were becoming swept up . in the booming drug trade after being targeted by dealers as they face . lighter sentences if caught. Revered Heyward Wiggins III of Camden Bible Tabernacle told Philly.com: 'Right now, we are going to funerals of a . lot of victims of the violence in the city, but we would love to bring . about an atmosphere where we don't have to attend funerals.'

"The tension between New York police and Mayor Bill de Blasio was sky high on Friday as a plane was seen waving a message reading: 'Our backs have turned to you.' The message, which flew above the Hudson River around 9am, was a reference to officers' reactions to de Blasio as he attended the hospital where the bodies of officers Rafael Ramos and Wenjian Liu were taken after they were shot on Saturday. As the mayor walked past the officers, many were seen turning their backs to him. A photo of the plane banner was shared by former cop John Cardillo on Twitter on Friday as family members gathered to remember Ramos at his wake and memorial service in Queens. Harsh words: This banner was seen flying across New York City on Friday morning. It refers to the moment police officers turned their backs on Mayor Bill de Blasio following the deaths of two cops last weekend . It is not clear who paid for the banner. Jersey Shore Aerial Advertising, which displayed the message, told the New York Daily News that the buyers wanted to stay anonymous. But on his website, Cardillo wrote that a 'large and unified group of current and retired NYC Police Officers, Detectives, & Supervisors' had asked him to post a message after seeing the plane. 'We are outraged by the mayor's incendiary rhetoric, and for facilitating the current hostile climate towards the NYPD,' he wrote on the blog. 'It is our opinion that Mayor de Blasio's dangerous and irresponsible comments about his and his wife's concern for their son's safety at the hands of the NYPD fueled the flames that led to civil unrest, and potentially to the deaths of PO Wenjian Liu and PO Rafael Ramos, as well as the continued threats against NYPD personnel.' The Mayor shows us no respect, and encourages the public to follow his lead.' The comments refer to how de Blasio revealed that he has warned his son Dante, who is mixed race, to be careful how he acts around police officers. Embattled: Some have blamed de Blasio, pictured Monday, for the deaths of the two officers last weekend after he apparently gave his support to people protesting against police violence . Cold shoulder: He can be seen walking past officers with their backs turned to him in Brooklyn last weekend . He made the comments in the aftermath of the deaths of black men, including Eric Garner and Michael Brown, at the hands of white police officers. Neither of the officers involved were charged. After a grand jury failed to indict the officer who held Garner in a chokehold, de Blasio expressed his shock. Some police officers believe he should have supported them more strongly. Instead, he supported protesters who police union leaders had accused of stirring up a loathing for police. 'We no longer have confidence in Mayor de Blasio, nor in his ability to lead New York City and promote the values that both the NYPD and the good law abiding citizens of the city hold dear,' Cardillo wrote. 'Mayor de Blasio turned his back on us long before we turned our backs on him.' Also on Friday, hundreds of mourners gathered at a church to pay their . respects to officer Ramos, who was shot by a man who claimed he wanted to avenge the death of Garner. Crowds of uniformed police officers greeted the hearse as it drove through the streets of Glendale. An NYPD flag was draped over Ramos' casket as officers carried it inside the church. Police officers from departments around the country were then expected to join U.S. Vice President Joe Biden and city and state officials for Ramos's funeral service on Saturday. Honored: The casket of New York City police officer Rafael Ramos is carried into Christ Tabernacle Church prior to his wake onFriday  in the Glendale neighborhood of the Queens borough . Victims: Ramos, left, was killed alongside fellow NYPD officer, Wenjian Liu, right, on Saturday. The gunman said he wanted to kill police officers to avenge the deaths of Michael Brown and Eric Garner . Tribute: People pay their respects to the slain police officers as the casket drives past in Glendale . Police had yet to announce details for the funeral of Liu, . 32, while federal officials helped some of his relatives in . China travel to the United States. The execution-style killing was so swift, according to the . city's police commissioner, that the officers may never have . seen their assailant, Ismaaiyl Brinsley, 28, who soon after shot . himself and died in a nearby subway station. Brinsley wrote online before the attack that he wanted tokill a couple of police officers to avenge the deaths of EricGarner and Michael Brown, unarmed black men killed by whitepolicemen in New York and Missouri.","The banner was seen flying across the sky on Friday morning .

Bollerman, who teaches at UP Academy Dorchester in Boston, said that she wished for every one of her students to be able to take home a book so that they could experience the joys of reading. As well as giving her the money, Capital One also granted her wish, and every child was given three books: Diary of a Wimpy Kid: The Long Haul, My Father's Dragon and Where the Wild Things Are. Scroll down for video .

She was honored this week by Boston Mayor Marty Walsh after donating her prize back to the school, which is only a year old. Governor Deval Patrick also sent her a letter. 'I want to thank Nikki for your kindness and your humility, and you are certainly a shining example of great things to the city of Boston,' Walsh said at the press conference. 'We are grateful for your hard work and generosity. You have inspired lots of people with your selfless act.' Bollerman told ABC News that it giving away the money seemed like the natural choice. 'I really made the wish for my students and I was blessed, lucky and thankful that Capital One gave me the opportunity,' she said. 'Since I made the wish for my students I thought I would do something to make their lives better rather than spend it on myself.' In her winning entry, she wrote: 'My #wishforothers is that my voracious, adorable, hardworking, loving scholars all leave for their December break with a book in their hand.' Joy: For her entry for the competition, she made a wish that all of her students would go home with a book over Christmas and in a video made by Capital One, she can be seen handing them out to the children . Emotional: Bollerman, 26, became emotional as she handed out the books to her third-grade class . Considerate: She said she had made the wish for the children so it seemed right they would get the money . Capital One also shared a video of the moment her children were presented with the books. 'I tried not to cry,' she said in the video as she was seen giving out the packages to her excited students. 'I really just wanted them to have books of their own.' Bollerman said she wants the money to be used on better computer access and coding lessons for the children. She told ABC that because she wanted every child in the school to go home with a book - not just her class - she and her mother bought each child in other classes a book as well. 'We are so proud of Nikki, her fellow teachers, and all of our scholars,' the school wrote on its website. 'Thank you for all that you do!'

"Three boys who spent the night with their grandmother so she wouldn't be alone on Christmas died with her Friday morning as a fire engulfed her home, authorities said. Terry Harris, 60, was thought to be trying to rush her three grandchildren, aged 9 to 14, out of her front door in Fayette County, Ohio, when they succumbed to the devastating fire which destroyed the house and left their bodies badly burned. The boys, named as Braylon Harris, nine, Broderick Harris, 11, and Kenyon Harris, 14, lived just two houses away but wanted to stay overnight to keep their grandmother company. Wreckage and death: The four badly burned bodies were pulled from the wreckage of this house in Fayette County, Ohio, on the morning of December 26. The boys stayed with their grandmother overnight so she wouldn't be alone on Christmas . The deadly blaze was reported at around 4am on December 26. By the time the fire was extinguished, most of the single-story, ranch-style home had been destroyed. Fayette County coroner Dr. Dennis Mesker said the badly burned bodies were turned over to the Montgomery County coroner's office for autopsies and confirmation. 'They didn't want their grandma to be by herself on Christmas night; that's why they spent the night there,' Fayette County Sheriff Vernon Stanforth said. 'The children just adored their grandmother.' State Fire Marshal's spokesman William Krugh said state investigators are still trying to determine what caused the blaze. Early blaze: The fire was reported to rescuers at 4am. They found the grandmother's body near the door, and believe she was trying to help the children escape . 'Devastating': Local officials spoke of the grief experienced by the boys' parents - who live just two houses away - and the wider community . Stanforth said the grandmother's body was found near the front door, with the children near, so authorities think she was trying to help them get out. Firefighters sifting through the smoldering debris found the bodies hours after the blaze erupted because the site was too unstable and hot before then. 'To lose three children and a grandparent, it's devastating to the family,' Stanforth said by telephone from the Washington Court House area some 40 miles southwest of Columbus. 'The fact that it's the holidays makes it even worse for the community.' He said that he had known the family for years and that the oldest boy had wrestled competitively. 'They're a very close-knit family,' he said. 'They were good boys.' Wrecked: Authorities scoured the site after the fire had gone out - and eventually found the four corpses among the ashes .","House set alight around 4am in Fayette County, Ohio, after Christmas night .

"Chancellor George Osborne spent more than £43,000 of taxpayers' money in a bid to prevent the European Union from introducing a cap on bankers' bonuses. Mr Osborne paid the money to a team of outside legal advisers while he considered taking an action to the European Court of Justice. However, the chancellor announced last month that he was abandoning his court challenge after he admitted that his case was 'unlikely to succeed'. Chancellor George Osborne spent £43,000 on legal fees in a bid to overturn an EU cap on bankers' bonuses . This comes as four of Britain's high street banks have awarded their senior executives shares worth more than £30 million on top of their basic pay. Shadow treasury minister Cathy Jamieson used the Freedom of Information Act to uncover the total cost of outside legal advice used by the Treasury. Ms Jamieson criticised the chancellor's use of external legal advisers to prevent a cap on the bonus payments to senior bankers. She said: 'While working families face a cost-of-living crisis, it is astounding George Osborne chose to waste taxpayers' money fighting a bank bonus cap. 'His decision revealed his true priorities and showed just how out of touch he is.' The Government complained that the planned cap, which restricts bonuses to 100 per cent of a banker's pay - or 200 per cent with the approval of shareholders - would encourage banks to increase basic pay. They also feared any cap could force talented bankers to flee Europe to areas of the world where they will be better remunerated. A Treasury spokeman said: 'As we have already said, the Government incurred some costs for external legal advice as part of its legal challenge to the EU bonus cap. These figures have already been fully disclosed.' Meanwhile, it has emerged four of Britian's high street banks have paid out more than £30 million in shares to their senior management despite EU efforts to restrict bonuses. Cathy Jamieson, shado . The Guardian reported that the money was paid to 'a dozen or so individuals' working for HSBC, Barclays, Lloyds and the Royal Bank of Scotland. The last two banks have received substantial taxpayer bail-outs. HSBC  paid its chief executive Stuart Gulliver £1.7 million in share awards. He was one of 13 people at the bank who received £13 million between them. Barclays gave £8 million people to its top dozen people while RBS - which is almost 80 per cent taxpayer owned - shared £5.5 million between ten people. Lloyds Banking Group, which is 24 per cent owned by the taxpayer gave its chief executive approximately £1 million while ten of his most senior colleagues shared a further £4 million. The European Banking Authority believes that the bonus awards breach the EU caps, but the Bank of England, which is opposed to the new EU rules, allowed the payments.","Chancellor George Osborne hired outside legal advice for EU court bid .

"Police are on the hunt for the twisted culprit who stole the baby Jesus from a Nativity in Haverhill, Massachusetts and replaced it with severed pigs head on Christmas morning. The figure of a baby Jesus was taken from a Nativity scene outside the Scared Hearts Church during the early hours on Christmas morning. It was replaced by a hairy pig's head, and not the kind that one would find at the butcher store. WARNING: GRAPHIC IMAGES . SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Sick theft: The figure of a baby Jesus was taken from a Nativity scene outside the Scared Hearts Church during the early hours on Christmas morning . Replaced: 'This particular pig is not the kind of pig that would be sold at a butcher shop,' Lieutenant Robert P. Pistone, a spokesman for the Haverhill Police Department said of the sick baby Jesus replacement . Fresh: The pig appears to have been freshly decapitated, said police who still don't know who could have committed the act of theft and vandalism on Christmas . Haverhill Police held a press conference this morning to discuss the offensive theft. 'This particular pig is not the kind of pig that would be sold at a butcher shop,' Lieutenant Robert P. Pistone, a spokesman for the Haverhill Police Department said. 'Usually they would remove all the hair,' he added. Pistone also said that the pig was likely 'freshly decapitated,' and that it may have come from a local farm. 'It's just a really hurtful commentary on society,' Pastor John Delaney told Fox today. 'And for someone to do this sad deed is really shocking.' This act of vandalism resembles one that happened at another church in Haverhill a few years ago in which a mysterious suspect left a few decapitated pig heads. Members of the church were hurt deeply by the incident this holiday season. 'They're heartbroken, they're horrified, they're outraged by this act that really speaks to us on this most solemn day of hurt,' Delaney said. Despite being hurt, residents gathered in support of the church, one even bringing a new baby Jesus to decorate the Nativity.

"Three South Koreans died yesterday after apparently inhaling toxic gas while constructing a nuclear power plant for a firm targeted by computer hackers. The tragedy came days after the hackers bragged that the control systems of the state-run Korea Hydro and Nuclear Power Company’s plants could be disabled. The trio were working in the city of Ulsan when they fell unconscious. They later died in hospital. Three South Koreans died after apparently inhaling toxic gas while constructing a nuclear power plant in Ulsan, pictured . Their employer said there was no reason to link the deaths to the hackers’ threats, which followed the publication online of documents on nuclear facilities and information on staff. The workers are believed to have been killed by a nitrogen leak. The element is used in power plants to reduce oxygen levels in cooling water, to slow oxidation of equipment or to control pressure levels in tanks. The company has yet to determine the cause of the accident, although the leaking of nitrogen was suspected, a company spokeswoman said. Construction of the plant is scheduled to be completed in June. Earlier this week, South Korean employees conducted a simulated drill to ensure the safety of nuclear power plants under cyber attacks, at a training center of the Wolseong Nuclear Power Plant . Last week, documents including layouts of nuclear facilities and personal information of nuclear workers were published online. Local media said the unidentified people who posted images of the stolen nuclear documents imprinted with “WHO AM I?” on a South Korean blog were hackers. The accident came as the plant was on high alert over the threats by hackers who claim they can disable the control systems of its plants, but the company said that the safety of the country’s nuclear power plants was not affected. Korea Hydro ran drills on Monday and Tuesday to prepare workers in the event of hacking attacks. The tragedy came days after the hackers bragged that the control systems of the state-run Korea Hydro and Nuclear Power Company’s plants could be disabled .","Trio working in Ulsan when they fell unconscious and later died in hospital .

"Just ten foreign property developers are behind plans for tens of thousands of new homes across London, fuelling fears that Britons will continue to be priced out of the capital’s housing market. The investors from Hong Kong, China, Malaysia, Australia Singapore and Sweden own sites earmarked to create more than 30,000 properties. Overseas buyers regard London property as a stable investment. The increase in sales has led critics to label the homes ‘safety deposit boxes’, with many of the owners never actually living in the properties – or even visiting them. Iconic: How Battersea's famous power station could be developed by a Malaysian consortium . In April, the Mail reported how Chinese investors were creating a national housing shortage. Developments in St John’s Wood in North London, the Greenwich Peninsula and the Olympic Park are reportedly being sold to overseas investors – with many of the homes offered to foreigners first. Swedish furniture retailer Ikea is developing 1,200 homes next to the Olympic Park in East London, while a Malaysian consortium is redeveloping Battersea Power station in South London, which will include thousands of new homes. A company run by Malaysian billionaire Ananda Krishnan plans 104 luxury homes on the site of the former St John’s Wood barracks in North West London, where homes could sell for more than £5million each, while a subsidiary controlled by Hong Kong billionaire Henry Cheng Kar-shun plans 10,000 homes in Greenwich, East London, including three-bedroom apartments costing more than £800,000. There is interest from Middle and Far Eastern investors for Hyde Park barracks in West London, which the Ministry of Defence is selling for £650million before its conversion to homes, and Singapore developer Oxley Holdings is planning 3,400 homes in Royal Wharf, East London. Nicky Gavron, the former deputy mayor of London and chairman of the London Assembly’s planning committee, told The Guardian: ‘There is a perception these major residential developments backed by international money, particularly in super-high towers, only serve a market for overseas investors who want to buy a luxury flat in a skyscraper to treat as a safety deposit box. From the Mail on April 5: The Mail told a how a huge property grab by Chinese investors was pricing Britons out of the market . 'Such properties often become buy-to-leave investments and don’t meet the needs of Londoners. ‘London is in the midst of a housing crisis – what we need is mixed-income housing where people actually live.’ Other developers are selling large numbers of flats to overseas buyers at Canary Wharf, King’s Cross and Earls Court. London property prices have soared, driven by demand from oligarchs and billionaires looking for a safe place to put their money. The average homeowner saw their property rise in value by £81,000 in London in a year, according to the Zoopla website – a rise of 15.6 per cent, compared with 6 per cent for the country as a whole. The average London home is worth £603,724, compared to £268,895 for the rest of Britain. But experts at the estate agent Savills claim that in a city where 37 per cent of residents were born abroad, most international buyers actually live and work in London, with those from overseas buying homes for investment accounting for just 7 per cent of all Greater London residential transactions.","Ten developments in London reportedly being sold to overseas investors .

"Nas has released a stunning new image of a mysterious galaxy that could help reveal how the universe formed - and looks like a still for a sci-fi classic. Called IC 335, this new NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope image shows the galaxy in front of a backdrop of distant galaxies. IC 335 is part of a galaxy group containing three other galaxies, and located in the Fornax Galaxy Cluster 60 million light-years away. Called IC 335, this new NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope image shows the galaxy in front of a backdrop of distant galaxies. A lenticular galaxy is a type of galaxy which is intermediate between an elliptical galaxy and a spiral galaxy in galaxy morphological classification schemes. They are disc galaxies (like spiral galaxies) which have used up or lost most of their interstellar matter and therefore have very little ongoing star formation. They consist mainly of aging stars (like elliptical galaxies). As S0 galaxies have only ill-defined spiral arms they are easily mistaken for elliptical galaxies if they are seen inclined face-on or edge-on as IC 335 here. Experts say it is a type of galaxy known as a S0. As seen in this image, the disk of IC 335 appears edge-on from the vantage point of Earth. This makes it harder for astronomers to classify it, as most of the characteristics of a galaxy’s characteristics -the arms of a spiral or the bar across the center - are only visible on its face. S0 types are lenticular galaxies are an intermediate state in galaxy morphological classification schemes between true spiral and elliptical galaxies. They have a thin stellar disk and a bulge, like spiral galaxies, but in contrast to typical spiral galaxies they have used up most of the interstellar medium. Only a few new stars can be created out of the material that is left and the star formation rate is very low. Hence, the population of stars in S0 galaxies consists mainly of aging stars, very similar to the star population in elliptical galaxies. As S0 galaxies have only ill-defined spiral arms they are easily mistaken for elliptical galaxies if they are seen inclined face-on or edge-on as IC 335 here. And indeed, despite the morphological differences between S0 and elliptical class galaxies, they share some common characteristics, like typical sizes and spectral features. Both classes are also deemed ""early-type"" galaxies, because they are evolving passively. However, while elliptical galaxies may be passively evolving when we observe them, they have usually had violent interactions with other galaxies in their past. The Spindle Galaxy (NGC 5866), a lenticular galaxy in the Draco constellation. In contrast, S0 galaxies are either aging and fading spiral galaxies, which never had any interactions with other galaxies, or they are the aging result of a single merger between two spiral galaxies in the past. The exact nature of these galaxies is still a matter of debate.","IC335  located in the Fornax Galaxy Cluster 60 million light-years away .

"Thousands of children across the country were left devastated after hackers took down the PlayStation and Xbox online networks on Christmas Day. While children were reduced to tears during the 'worst Christmas ever', parents fumed about paying hundreds of pounds for games consoles that could not be used. In furious internet posts they demanded that console manufacturers Sony and Microsoft pay compensation for the worldwide fault and asked why it took so long for the problems to be corrected. Mark Haynes said there had been 'tantrums, tears and everything else' after attempts to set up the Xbox One console he had bought for his children Archie (pictured), 13, and Olivia, 11, kept failing . A notorious group of hackers called Lizard Squad said it carried out the hack 'for the laughs' and to expose poor online security. The consoles rely on an internet connection for many of their functions. Parents were so angered by the issues with the machines, which cost up to £349, that they wrote hundreds of messages to both companies on Twitter accompanied by the message '#christmasruined'. Ros Bruce said her ten-year-old son had spent weeks planning what games he and his friend would play together ahead of receiving an Xbox One for Christmas. The boy was sorely disappointed when he tried to download a game and was still unable to play it more than 15 hours later. Miss Bruce, from Essex, said: 'He has spent most of the day in tears. He says it's been his worst Christmas ever. I think Xbox should compensate us all.' A Twitter user from Scotland also called for a refund and said: '£450 later and the kids have an expensive plastic paperweight.' Mark Haynes told the Daily Mail there had been 'tantrums, tears and everything else' after attempts to set up the Xbox One console he had bought for his children Archie, 13, and Olivia, 11, kept failing. Mr Haynes, 50, from Ely, Cambridgeshire, criticised Microsoft's response to the problem after calling technical support four times only to be told by one staff member that the company 'had no idea what was going on'. Gamers around the world were left disappointed on Christmas Day after hacking group Lizard Squad carried through with its threat to bring down both Sony's PlayStation Network and Microsoft's Xbox Live service . Lizard Squad first announced that it planned to take down the PlayStation Network and Xbox Live on Christmas Day in early December, describing itself as the 'next generation Grinch' The hack took down Microsoft's Xbox Live and Sony's PlayStation Network. Popular games such as Call Of Duty and The Sims 4 were all but useless for frustrated gamers. Analysts said that the attack was a DDOS, or distributed denial of service attack, in which online networks are overwhelmed by traffic, leaving normal users unable to gain access. One of the most popular features of the consoles is the ability to play against friends and other users who are in different locations. This feature, however, requires an internet connection and many children were left disappointed at their inability to use it. While an internet connection is not required to play all games, new Xbox One consoles need to be online to be successfully set-up. Many of those who received the consoles as Christmas presents are thought to have experienced problems getting started. Furthermore, games on both consoles often require an internet connection to be installed fully, which was ruled out by the hack. A message on the Xbox status page yesterday said that its core services were 'up and running' but PlayStation said engineers were continuing to work on 'network issues'. There has been no official link between the incident and the infiltration of Sony's computers by hackers said to be working for North Korea. However, Sony and Microsoft were heavily involved in the release of The Interview, the comedy film about the communist nation which has angered its tyrannical leader Kim Jong-Un; the film centres on a plot by two American journalists to assassinate him. Sony's entertainment division produced the movie, and Microsoft made it available to stream on its Xbox film service. There are 48million worldwide subscribers to the Xbox's internet features, and more than double that for the PlayStation, which has some 110million. Last month Sony announced that it had sold one million consoles in the UK just eight months after launching, with a sales boost expected before Christmas. In an interview on tech website Winbeta, Lizard Squad said that it had carried out the attack on Christmas Day to 'anger and reach the largest amount of people'. It claimed that the attack was to highlight poor online security and that Microsoft had barely any protection at all for its Xbox online network.","Hackers took down PlayStation and Xbox networks on Christmas Day .

"The stunning photographs capture a natural wonder that is hidden deep in the Arizona desert. The breathtaking rock formation, known as The Wave, is made from sand that has been hardened over 190million years. Its remarkable undulating appearance, streaked with layers of autumnal hues, captures the way that the geological landscape has changed. It is made formed of Navajo Sandstone dunes that have calcified vertically and horizontally - turning into hardened compacted rock over time - with wind and rain erosion creating its sheer rock faces. The breathtaking scene lies some 5,225ft above sea level, somewhere in the Vermillion Cliffs Wilderness Area. Largely unknown until it was advertised to tourists in the 1990s, visitors must now obtain a special permit to find its exact location. And even then they need to navigate a three-mile hike through the wilderness to find the beauty spot. Photographer Justin Reznick, 36, captured  the unique landscape on a trip this spring.

"This year has been testing for John Bercow. Alongside a taxing day-job as Speaker of the House, the 51-year-old has been faced with the scandal of his wife kissing another man in public and her gallivanting around London hot-spots. But the politician was afforded one treat to see out the year - an interview with his 'hero', tennis champion Roger Federer. Taking a spot as a guest-editor of BBC Radio 4's Today Programme, Mr Bercow was given a whole five minutes to pick the athlete's brain during its Boxing Day broadcast. Between serious questions about the tennis player's sporting success, the Speaker slipped in the fact that he had watched him 65 times this year, more than Federer's own mother, as pointed out by a BBC presenter. Scroll down for video . John Bercow interviewed his 'hero' Roger Federer for the Boxing Day BBC Radio 4 Today Programme . Referring to Federer's comment that travelling the world is 'a lot of fun', Mr Bercow gushed: 'Maybe that concept demonstrates one of the differences between you and other great players, you don't see it as a burden to be borne. 'I've watched 65 of your matches this year and I always have the impression that you absolutely love it.' Later in the interview he casually rolls off the champion's achievements, ('302 weeks as number one,  25 grand slams singles, 36, semi finals and and 43 quarter finals), before pleading: 'What explains that consistency of performance?' Modestly, Federer says his achievements were inspired by the greats before him, namely Michael Jordan and Tiger Woods. John Bercow MP sleeps in the Royal Box of Centre Court  Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic compete in the Wimbledon men's singles final on July 1 this year . Later, when asked by BBC presenter Mishal Husain when he believes his sporting idol will hang up his racquet, he protests: 'I don't see him declining.' Sporting a Roger Federer hat, Mr Bercow, a former child tennis star himself, continues: 'I think the magnificent movement, the extraordinary stroicism and calm under pressure are something special and I think that for as long as Roger wants to play, lets's enjoy him. 'He's the greatest tennis player I've ever seen in my life.' Despite his elation, listeners were quick to question how the politician had time throughout the year to attend 65 matches, missing only 20 played by the star this year. 'If John Bercow had time on his hands to attend 65 Federer matches in 2014 why do we need a commons speaker?' asked one Twitter user, while another observed: 'Busy speaker!'.

Daniel Caban and Officer Darrell James responded to a call around 5.50pm on Thursday and when they climbed on the train, they could already see the baby's head, they said. A group of riders had formed a circle around the mother to give her some privacy as she went into labor on the Market-Frankford Line, the Philadelphia Inquirer reported. The officers, who both have children of their own, donned their gloves and Caban knelt down to catch the baby boy as he was born at the 15th Street station. Scroll down for video .

The newborn's parents, an Asian couple in their late 20s or early 30s, spoke very little English but the officers were able to ask the father for a sweater to wrap the baby. They then placed the little boy into his mother's arms. 'The mother was at peace with the baby,' Caban told the Inquirer. The youngster's umbilical cord was slightly tangled around his neck, but he looked healthy and was taken to Hahnemann University Hospital.

"An 'inspirational' mother lost her two-year battle to cancer on Christmas morning, minutes before her five-year-old boys woke up to open their presents. Charity founder and blogger Kate Gross, who worked under two Prime Ministers early in her career, died peacefully at home in Cambridge yesterday. Her mother, Jean, announced the 36-year-old had died at 6.29am, with enough time to say goodbye to husband Billy. But it was just ten minutes before her sons, twins Oscar and Isaac, woke up and asked 'is it morning?', ready to open their Christmas stockings. Scroll down for video . Kate Gross, pictured with her husband Billy, died aged 36, on Christmas Day, minutes before her sons Oscar and Isaac woke up . Former prime minister Tony Blair, who is a patron of the charity she founded, led tributes to the mother-of-two, calling her a 'fabulous colleague' and a 'dear friend'. Ms Gross was the founding CEO of charity Africa Governance Initiative (AGI), which has helped bring a change to the continent. More recently, it has been involved in the fight against Ebola in Liberia and Sierra Leone. When she was diagnosed with colon cancer two years ago, Ms Gross documented her battle on her blog - where she dubbed the disease 'The Nuisance'. After reading English at Oxford University, Ms Gross joined the civil service and worked in Downing Street for four years as a private secretary for Tony Blair and Gordon Brown. Ms Gross was the founding charity Africa Governance Initiative and was an aide to former Prime Ministers Tony Blair and Gordon Brown . And this year, she was awarded an OBE for her services to the public and charitable sectors. Ton Blair paid tribute to Kate Gross, calling her death 'utterly tragic' and described her as a 'dear friend' Mr Blair said: 'Kate's death at such a young age is utterly tragic. My thoughts and prayers are with Billy, the boys, Kate's parents and her many friends. 'But the tragedy of her death only illuminates the magnificence of her life. Her work and her achievement will endure. 'She created and built AGI as an organisation that took a new and innovative approach to development and today is making change happen in many different African countries. 'She gave it an ethos and spirit that is a unique combination of public service and enterprise. She took the small band of staff at the beginning and helped put together the flourishing and strong team of professionals which represent AGI today. Mr Blair added: 'She was a fabulous colleague, a wonderful leader and a dear friend. Her illness saw her reach new heights as a writer and sage, giving everyone around her hope and purpose in their lives even as her own drew to a close. 'Kate was an inspiration when she was with us. She will remain an inspiration now and for the future. She was a life changer and a life giver. 'I feel privileged and proud to have worked with her and been part of her life.' Her mother wrote on the blog yesterday: 'Kate’s last two weeks were characterised by the same qualities that marked her life. 'There was care for others: were we all OK, would we be OK, how could she make it OK for us? 'There was a decision not to complain.' Kate's mother wrote a 'Last Post' on her blog to announce her passing at 6.29am on Christmas Day . And earlier this month, Ms Gross wrote her poignant final blog post, entitled 'May Your Days Be Merry And Bright', in which she urged people to enjoy every moment as she prepared to enjoy her last Christmas with her family. She wrote: 'The ghost of Christmas Future will hang around our table this year. 'As we decorate the tree, open our presents and sit down for lunch, I will not be the only one imagining what these same rituals will be like next December when I am no longer there. 'This is my last Christmas; 2015 is the last New Year I will see in. I am 36, my twin boys are not-yet-six, and I am dying from advanced colon cancer. 'I have had this disease for over two years, but now I am drawing in like the December nights, knocking on the door of what Philip Gould called the death zone – the great winding down we all will face when we have weeks, not more, left to live.' And she concluded: 'My promise this year is to enjoy all of it. These days that lead up to it, not just the main event. The grumpiness, anger and frustration with my best beloveds that are a reminder that I am alive and red blood still pumps through my veins. 'I am pale imitation of the energetic parent I once was, but there is still pleasure to be gained from Christmas as a spectator sport. Her memoir, Late Fragments: Everything I Want to Tell You (About This Magnificent Life), comes out on January 15 . 'Though my Christmases past are blissful memories, I do not need to live there. The present is no idyll, but it’s what we have. And I intend to enjoy it. May you all do the same.' Liz Lloyd, chair of the AGI Board added: 'Kate was the first leader of AGI, taking it from a an idea to a fully formed organisation with a growing reputation and credibility amongst our partners and those we work with. 'She was funny, chic and had a sharp eye for detail. She will always be remembered as the founding CEO who established AGI and prepared it for success in the future.' She added: 'On a personal level she has been my friend over these many years and I treasure especially the moments and experiences we have shared over the last year or so.' The charity's CEO Nick Thompson added:  'We are all heartbroken by the news of Kate's death. 'If life is to be measured in achievements rather than years, then Kate set the standard to which we will always aspire. 'She stood apart in so many ways, and through her combination of optimism and steel inspired and challenged us always. We are proud to be a part of her legacy. 'In the last two years she demonstrated also that she was an incredible writer, with an ability to see life and to tell it as it is. No tribute can capture the essence of Kate as well as she did herself in her book and her blog. 'That people around the world have drawn comfort and strength from her extraordinary words, written in her final weeks and months, is itself a remarkable gift and achievement. 'Our thoughts and prayers are with Billy and her family, who will always be a part of our family too.'

"A man who shed half of his body weight after being diagnosed with a severe food addiction was at risk of eating himself 'to death' before his mother staged an intervention to try and tackle his eating issues. When he was at his heaviest in September 2011, Jason Brown, 45, from Los Angeles, weighed more than 530 pounds but has since managed to lose almost half of that thanks to an intensive rehabilitation program and subsequent diet and fitness regime. 'I have been battling food addiction since the day I was born I think,' Jason, who features in this month's 'Half Their Size' special issue of People Magazine, told MailOnline. Healthy and happy: Jason Brown, 45, now weighs 239 pounds, having lost almost half of his body weight . In the past: At his heaviest, Jason weighed more than 530 pounds and wore a size XXXXXXXXL shirt . 'But my weight loss journey started in September 2011, when I was at my heaviest. I weighed just over 530 pounds at that point. 'Things in my life were bad, both professionally and personally, and when I was stressed I would just eat. 'I was eating myself to death basically.' But when Jason, who previously wore shirt size XXXXXXXXL, first sought help from his doctors, the only advice he received was to 'get on a treadmill'. 'I felt awful and I knew that I had some serious issues with my eating,' he explained. 'But a lot of people don't understand food addiction. 'Doctors just told me to get on a treadmill for 30 minutes a day, like that would solve all of my problems. I was asking for antidepressants and that's all they could say to me.' Jason admits that he quickly spiraled into a dangerous cycle of isolated binge eating, shutting himself off from the world completely and hiding away from people. 'I was completely isolated for 14 hours a day,' he said. 'I kept myself away from everyone.' Moving on: The weight loss guru hopes that his experiences will help others to tackle their eating issues . Battling addiction: Jason admits that it took him a long time to find anyone who could help him understand what his food addiction really meant - and claims that his doctors told him to 'get on a treadmill' It was only when his mother stepped in that Jason really began receiving the help that he needed - in the form of interventionist Brad Lamm. 'My mother contacted Brad, who runs a group of Breathe Life Healing Centers and has a program to treat food addiction and binge eating,' Jason revealed. 'He was the key man who basically saved my life. He helped me get into rehab and then afterwards I went and stayed at one of his Breathe Life Healing Centers, where I kept on working on my diet and my fitness routine. 'Without him I would be dead.' Now, Jason works alongside Brad helping other food addiction sufferers to work towards overcoming their illness, a struggle which Jason continues to face every day. 'I share my experience with people because I want to give them hope,' he explained. 'I think that if they can see what I have been through and what I have achieved, then they will know that they can do it too. 'The big thing in addiction is that you can't face it alone. You need people there to help you and support you along the way. 'There were days when I felt like saying 'f*** it', but I never gave up. I was so regimented in my plan and in what I was doing. 'I wake up at 5.30am and work out, six days a week. Working out helps me to stay clean and stay focused.' And while Jason is now 'incredibly happy' with his life, he is still determined to lose a few more pounds - although he refuses to focus on his weight as a number, choosing instead to concentrate on what makes him feel healthy and happy. 'I still want to lose more weight, but the number isn't something that I want to focus on,' he added. 'But I am so happy now. I'm social, I have friends, I go out. My life has completely changed for the better.' Breakfast . One omelette made with three egg whites, one egg yolk and a cup of fresh vegetables . Half a cup of mixed berries .

"Jeremy Clarkson was one of the thousands of people who turned out to watch the traditional Boxing Day hunt as it rode through his farmland in Oxfordshire earlier today. The Heythrop Hunt, which makes its way through Chipping Norton, also takes in land belonging to the Top Gear presenter, which he has renamed Diddly Squat farm. Earlier today, Mr Clarkson could be seen wrapped up in a scarf and heavy coat and wearing boots as he and two friends awaited the arrival of the horses, their riders and the dogs on his farm. Top Gear presenter Jeremy Clarkson (centre) watches the Heythrop Hunt as it rides through Oxfordshire farmland that belongs to him . The BBC host has been a keen supporter of the hunt, which is said to be popular among members of the Chipping Norton set - an influential group of MPs and media professionals who live close to the Oxfordshire market town. Earlier this year, Mr Clarkson submitted a planning application to redevelop the main house into a mansion on the farmland, where the hunt rode by earlier today. The farm is just a few miles away from his country home on the outskirts of Chipping Norton. Mr Clarkson bought the farmhouse in Chipping Norton in 2009 with plans to own quad bikes and grow his own food . The 54-year-old had plans to demolish the property which is set within a 70-hectare plate approved, and intends to replace it with a larger house complete with a swimming pool and tennis court. The luxury home will also boast its own orchard and croquet lawn, as well as renovating a derelict barn to feature a snooker room and two more bedrooms. The new property will boast plenty of space for animals with existing stables in place and plans for a kennel and dog.

Hundreds of people gathered in Chipping Norton town square for the traditional Boxing Day Hunt . In an blog post written on the Top Gear website in early 2009, Mr Clarkson said he had bought the farm in Chipping Norton and planned to whizz around on quad bikes with his children. Other prominent supporters of the Heythrop Hunt include Rebekah Brooks, the former chief executive of News International, and her husband Charlie Brooks, who is a racehorse trainer. Mr Brooks was also in the town square in Chipping Norton today where hundreds of people turned out to greet the horses and their riders. He was seen holding up a sign advertising the next hunt meeting and mingling with the crowds. Other prominent supporters of the Heythrop Hunt include Rebekah Brooks, the former chief executive of News International, and her husband Charlie Brooks . It emerged yesterday that hunt supporters are planning to use the drive to introduce English votes for English laws to push through a repeal of the foxhunting ban after the next election . The Prime Minister David Cameron has also ridden with the hunt six times, which is close to his constituency home in Oxfordshire. In 2003, he described the then proposed ban on hunting as ‘illiberal and bossy’. The Heythrop Hunt was one of 300 taking place up and down the country today, which comes 10 years after the Hunting Act was passed banning fox hunting. However, it emerged yesterday that hunt supporters are planning to use the drive to introduce English votes for English laws to push through a repeal of the foxhunting ban after the next election. Thousands of supporters are expected to have took part today in defiance of the ban, which was pushed through reluctantly by Tony Blair as a piece of 'red meat' to keep his backbenchers on side.","Top Gear presenter turned out to watch the traditional Boxing Day hunt .

"Dutch scientists are recreating the deaths of some of the world's most famous personalities by reconstructing their last moments using scents and sounds. From the sweet smell of Jacqueline Kennedy's perfume, mingled with the scent of John F. Kennedy's blood to Whitney Houston's last drug-fuelled moments in a Beverly Hills bathtub, scientists at Breda university say they offer visitors a unique, if somewhat macabre, historical snapshot. The controversial museum exhibit is currently on display at the Museum of the Image in the Netherlands, with plans to send it across Europe. Not your normal museum exhibit: Visitors are invited to lie in a series of four silver metal boxes similar to those found in a morgue, where smells and sounds of famous deaths are piped in . Visitors are invited to lie in a series of four silver metal boxes similar to those found in a morgue. The boxes, which are pitch-dark inside, are rigged with pipes leading to bottles containing pressurised smells. A soundtrack is played and different scents are released into the box to recreate a specific 'final moment'. For about five minutes, visitors can relive the smells and sounds believed to have surrounded four people whose deaths are etched into the world's collective memory: Kennedy, Diana, Princess of Wales, Muammar Gaddafi and Houston. 'We all have seen the images of JFK's assassination, but what did it smell like?' asks Frederik Duerinck, of the communication and multimedia design faculty of Breda's Avans university of applied sciences. To find out, visitors to the Museum of the Image in the Netherlands with a sense of the morbid are invited to lie in a series of four silver metal boxes similar to those found in a morgue. The boxes, which are pitch-dark inside, are rigged with pipes leading to bottles containing pressurised smells. A soundtrack is played and different scents are released into the box to recreate a specific 'final moment'. For about five minutes, visitors can relive the smells and sounds believed to have surrounded four people whose deaths are etched into the world's collective memory: Kennedy (1963); Diana, Princess of Wales (1997); Muammar Gaddafi (2011) and Houston (2012). For instance, those wanting to experience Houston's final moments are transported to a bathtub at the upmarket Beverly Hills hotel where the diva died in February 2012 at age 48. A coroner ruled the singer died of accidental drowning, with cocaine and heart disease listed as contributing factors. To the sounds of splashing water and Houston's voice, a visitor first gets a whiff of generic cleaner, used in hotels around the world, followed by the olive oil the singer used in her tub. Then a strong chemical odour, similar to that of cocaine, fills the box, grabbing its occupant by the throat, followed by the sound of rushing water and then silence. 'Smell is rarely used in communication and we wanted to explore its uses,' said Mr Duerinck. 'It's a very powerful means of communication.' visitors say the experience is 'quite surprising and spectacular,' A soundtrack is played and different scents are released into the box to recreate a specific 'final moment' during the five minute experience. Scientists have proved smells are linked to the part of the brain that regulates emotion and memory. Odours are often used in the retail industry to trigger a buying mood in customers. 'Who doesn't want to buy a loaf after catching a whiff of fresh bread?' said Mr Duerinck, who together with other lecturers and students has put together an inventory of odours and is devising new ways of using smell: for instance in storytelling. 'It's quite surprising and spectacular,' said Riks Soepenberg, 31, who experienced a recreation of Gaddafi's last moments as the former Libyan strongman was hunted and killed by rebels in October 2011. Those wanting to experience Houston's final moments are transported to a bathtub at the upmarket Beverly Hills hotel where the diva died in February 2012 at age 48. A coroner ruled the singer died of accidental drowning, with cocaine and heart disease listed as contributing factors. To the sounds of splashing water and Houston's voice, a visitor first gets a whiff of generic cleaner, used in hotels around the world, followed by the olive oil the singer used in her tub. Then a strong chemical odour, similar to that of cocaine, fills the box, grabbing its occupant by the throat, followed by the sound of rushing water and then silence. 'You can watch the pictures as many times as you want - it's just not the same thing,' he said of the attack on Gaddafi's convoy, forcing the long-serving leader to hide in a drainage pipe before being murdered. 'I almost felt myself being hunted,' said Mr Soepenberg. In coming months, the installation will be taken across Europe. 'We've conducted extensive research,' said Wander Eikenboom, another lecturer at Avans about the authenticity of the experience. 'There's already a lot of information available on the internet, such as what perfume Jackie Kennedy or JFK were wearing,' said Mr Eikenboom. 'Whitney Houston's autopsy report, for instance, is also available,' he said. In coming months, the installation will be taken across Europe. But the scientists admit battling to recreate the right scent for Jackie's perfume, which is no longer made. 'We had to rebuild something that resembled it as closely as possible,' said scientist Mark Meeuwenoord. The inventors of the 'final moments' smells said in any case, exact historical accuracy was not their aim. Rather, they wanted to explore new ways of 'smelling' old stories.","Museum of the Image in the Netherlands created exhibit with scientists .

"The Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby has been diagnosed with pneumonia after he was forced to abandon his traditional Christmas Day sermon due to illness. Dr Welby travelled to Sierra Leone last week where he visited children affected by Ebola at a church-run facility. Lambeth Palace confirmed today that his 'heavy cold' has now been diagnosed as pneumonia. Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby, pictured, has been diagnosed with pneumonia . He had earlier been given the all-clear from Ebola after his flying visit to the crisis hit region last week. But Lambeth Palace tweeted today: 'Just to confirm the Archbishop of Canterbury @JustinWelby has pneumonia & is resting at home. Thanks for all your prayers & good wishes.' Sierra Leone has so far reported more than 9,000 cases of the highly contagious disease claiming the lives of almost 2,600 people. A spokeswoman for the Archbishop said he was in Sierra Leone for just three hours and has been fully assessed by Public Health England. 'He has been fully checked out. He was suffering for a head cold before going to Sierra Leone. He's been trying to shake it off for a couple of weeks.' The spokeswoman stated 'categorically' that Archbishop Welby was not suffering from Ebola. Last week, Archbishop Welby visited a church-run centre in Tintafor Sierra Leone  for children affected by Ebola where he sang with some of the children before delivering a sermon in the capital Freetown . Dr Welby was due to give his sermon yesterday at Canterbury Cathedral, where he planned to address the centenary of the truce between British and German troops. He wanted to remind worshippers that while the truce in 1914 provided a brief respite from the war, that the killing resumed shortly afterwards. Dr Welby was due to tell worshipers that the Christmas message should not be reduced to 'fictional stories' of of people 'swapping photos, shaking hands and sharing chocolate'. His planned sermon advised: 'At Christmas 1914, soldiers took the risk, crossed a battleline and kindled an evening of friendship and football. 'It is the moment all have picked on this year, whether in adverts or sermons. 'The truce illustrates something of the heart of Christmas, whereby God sends his Son, that vulnerable sign of peace, to a weary war-torn world. 'The problem is that the way it is told now it seems to end with a ""happy ever after"". 'Of course we like Christmas stories with happy endings: singing carols, swapping photos, shaking hands, sharing chocolate, but the following day the war continued with the same severity.' 'Nothing had changed; it was a one-day wonder. That is not the world in which we live, truces are rare.' Dr Welby wanted to warn worshipers that the Christmas story should not be reduced to something 'fictional, naive and tidy'. He was due to say: 'Jesus came to the reality of this world to transform that reality - not to take us into some fantasy kind of ""happy ever after"" but to ""Good News of great joy for all people"" He was due to add: 'Jesus did not come for one day. Jesus changed things for ever.' A Lambeth Palace spokesman said: 'The Archbishop of Canterbury, the Most Rev Justin Welby, is suffering from a severe cold and will, with great regret, no longer be preaching the sermon at Canterbury Cathedral this morning. 'The Dean of Canterbury, the Very Rev Robert Willis, will deliver a homily.' Earlier, Archbishop Welby said 'the deceit and cruelty of governments and rulers as not changed in the 2,000 years since King Herod'.","Archbishop Justin Welby has been diagnosed with pneumonia .

"Scot Young, pictured with former girlfriend Noelle Reno, left an NHS mental health facility hours before he fell to his death from a flat . Doctors face an inquiry into the death of tycoon Scot Young after it emerged he left an NHS mental health facility just hours before he fell 60ft from a flat. Mr Young, 52, who was involved in one of Britain’s most notorious divorce cases, landed on metal railings outside a £3million apartment earlier this month. It has emerged that he had admitted himself to the NHS Gordon Hospital in central London on December 5. The facility specialises in treating the most severe mental health problems and its website says it only admits patients who are ‘in an acute phase of a serious mental illness’. But Mr Young walked out on December 8 and was dead hours later, after showing up at his ex-girlfriend’s apartment and warning he was going to jump. Health workers were obliged to contact him within 24 hours for a check-up, but he was dead by the time they called. Doctors were accused of failing Mr Young, who had twice previously been sectioned under the Mental Health Act and was taking prescription medication for bipolar disorder. His family is furious that he was allowed to leave the facility when he was apparently acting ‘manic’ and ‘crazy’. But as Mr Young had not been sectioned, hospital staff could not force him to stay. The NHS has begun an investigation to find out why he was discharged. James Creed, one of Mr Young’s closest friends, said: ‘He was in a mental home. He was in the same place two years ago, it’s a horrible place. He called me when he was there, every day. Then he called me on the Monday and said he was coming out. I don’t know why.’ Mr Young, a former fixer to the super rich, was found impaled on railings outside a flat in Montagu Square, Marylebone. He was one of Britain’s wealthiest men, with a fortune of up to £2billion, luxury properties in Surrey, Mayfair, Knightsbridge and Miami, a collection of supercars and a private jet. But he became embroiled in one of the most high profile divorces ever seen in the UK, with former wife Michelle, 50, accusing him of hiding millions from her and their two daughters. He claimed he had lost all his money in a Russian property deal but she demanded £300million, saying he was worth ‘a few billion’. Scroll down for video . The tycoon was killed after falling 60ft from his multi-million pound apartment onto metal railings (pictured) Doctors were accused of failing Mr Young, who had twice previously been sectioned under the Mental Health Act and was taking prescription medication for bipolar disorder . The businessman, a friend of Topshop mogul Sir Philip Green and late Russian oligarch Boris Berezovsky, was last November ordered to pay her £20million, plus £6million in legal costs. He was also jailed for refusing to reveal how much money he was worth. After his release, Mr Young became engaged to 31-year-old American fashion designer and TV presenter Noelle Reno. She was a star of the Bravo reality show Ladies of London. But he was apparently drinking heavily and using cocaine, and she split up with him a few months ago. When Miss Reno arrived home on December 8, she found him inside apparently ‘manic, crazy and probably high’ and she demanded he leave, friends said. She allegedly walked out and called the police to remove him, while he phoned her, saying he was going to jump out of the window. By the time police arrived, he was dead. Mr Young previously claimed he had been followed by private detectives hired by his ex-wife. ‘In the condition I am in, paranoia can manifest in many ways, especially when you have eight people following you,’ he said. ‘I spent 14 days in hospital under the Mental Health Act … It was not a nice experience.’ Young had admitted himself to the NHS Gordon Hospital (pictured) in central London, but walked out on the day of his death . Police insist Mr Young’s death is not being treated as suspicious but there has been much speculation, including claims he was linked to the notorious Adams crime family. Friends also claimed he was targeted by Russian mafia who had previously dangled him out of a window at the Dorchester Hotel, Park Lane. One said he was the fifth member of a ‘ring of death’ – five friends who have died in unusual circumstances in recent years – including TV star Trinny Woodall’s ex-husband Johnny Elichaoff, millionaire property tycoon Robert Curtis, who dated model Caprice, entrepreneur Paul Castle and Mr Berezovsky. An inquest into Mr Young’s death was adjourned on Tuesday and will resume next month. A spokesman for Central and North West London NHS Foundation Trust said: ‘We are also investigating his care and his mutually agreed discharge from the ward to home.’ The Russian exile who fled for Britain fearing for his life . Oligarch Boris Berezovsky was found dead in the bathroom of his Berkshire home in March last year – after fleeing Russia fearing for his life. The 67-year-old businessman amassed a huge fortune after the Soviet Union collapsed and state assets were privatised. But after a high profile falling out with Russian President Vladimir Putin, he was granted political asylum in the UK in 2003. During his life, Mr Berezovsky survived many assassination attempts, including a bomb which decapitated his chauffeur. In 2012, he lost a £3 billion damages claim against Chelsea Football Club owner Roman Abramovich in 2012, after which he told family members he feared he had been poisoned. Mr Berezovsky was also one of the investors who, alongside Scot Young, lost a lot of money in a mysterious property deal in Russia named ‘Project Moscow’. In March, he was found hanged by a scarf and police investigated possible foul play. It was later declared that there had been no sign of a struggle – even though an expert speaking at the inquest into his death said he could not have killed himself. Professor Bernd Brinkmann, who deals with hanging and asphyxiation cases, claimed the marks on the oligarch’s neck indicated he had been killed. Mr Berezovsky was more likely to have been strangled by someone else and then hanged from the shower rail in the bathroom, he said. His daughter Elizaveta Berezovskaya told the inquest she feared he was assassinated for warning that Mr Putin was a ‘danger to the world’. Trinny’s Woodall's ex who friends 'cannot comprehend' would kill himself . Financial adviser Johnny Elichaoff, who used to be married to TV presenter Trinny Woodall, died last month after falling from the roof of a London shopping centre. The 55-year-old was a drummer and managed rock bands such as Fairground Attraction before getting involved in business. He became friendly with Scot Young through his work as a financial advisor but had also hit hard times – first divorcing his TV presenter wife in 2009, before more recently being forced to sell his businesses. Just weeks before his death at Whiteleys shopping centre in west London, he had been talked down from the same roof. Friends said they were devastated, but could not comprehend that he would have wanted to take his own life. The tycoon who dated Caprice but lost it all and fell under Tube train . Millionaire property tycoon Robert Curtis is another friend of Young’s who was killed in recent years. The 47-year-old businessman, who used to date model Caprice, died after being hit by a train in North West London two years ago. He had made his money in the 2000s alongside Mr Young in the London property market and was known for his lavish lifestyle, expensive cars and designer wardrobe. At the height of his success, he was the director of 15 firms and worked from an office in upmarket St John’s Wood, near Lord’s cricket ground, while being chauffeured in a Rolls Royce with a personalised number plate. The money suddenly dried up in recent years, though, and he faced huge debts. All but one of his companies folded. Before his death, the father-of-one had moved out of home and was living in a Travelodge hotel in Whetstone, North London. He had £25 cash in his pocket when he was killed by a southbound Jubilee Line train at Kingsbury station in North West London. The polo fan who played with Prince Charles and died near his London office . Entrepreneur Paul Castle also died after being hit by a Tube train. The tycoon, 54, had come from little money and had few qualifications but managed to make a fortune in property and flew between homes in the UK, France and Switzerland in his private plane. Mixing with elite crowds, he boasted of playing polo with Prince Charles and was photographed shaking hands with the Queen after the match. The father-of-two had been married three times and was due to marry his fourth wife but was apparently hit badly by the recession. Mr Castle, who is said to have socialised with Mr Young at London’s exclusive Cipriani restaurant, was killed in 2010. He was found under a carriage at Bond Street, near his London office. The lawyer who foresaw his death days before fatal helicopter crash . High-flying lawyer Stephen Curtis was killed in a mysterious helicopter crash near Bournemouth in 2004. Mr Curtis, said to have been worth £100million, told a friend just a week before he died: 'If anything happens to me in the next few weeks, it will not be an accident.' Scotland Yard said there were no suspicious circumstances at the time and referred the deaths of Mr Curtis and pilot Max Radford, 34, to a coroner, who ruled he lost his bearings in torrid weather. But the family of Mr Radford say Russian oligarchs were behind the crash which killed the pair. Mr Radford's mother, Gloria, 72, said: 'It was no pilot error - that is balderdash.' Father-of-one Mr Curtis, 45, is said to have lost much of his fortune after investing in Project Moscow.","Scot Young left a mental hospital hours before he fell 60ft from a flat .

"A priest has been found dead of a gunshot wound to the head in Mexico's southern Guerrero state, his diocese said Friday. Rev. Gregorio Lopez Gorostieta's death marks the latest in a series of abductions, attacks and highway robberies against Roman Catholic clerics in the state which is dominated by drug cartels. He is the third Catholic priest to have been killed in the region this year, and the first to die since the federal government launched a special, stepped-up security operation in the area following the disappearance of 43 teachers' college students three months ago. Scroll down for video . Rev. Gregorio Lopez Gorostieta (pictured) was found dead of a gunshot would to the head . The motive in Lopez Gorostieta's killing remains unclear; Bishop Maximino Martinez said a group had been seen lurking around the seminary where the priest taught on the outskirts of Ciudad Altamirano, Guerrero, on Sunday and Monday. Lopez Gorostieta was apparently kidnapped by the gang early Monday; his truck was found abandoned two days later. 'This is another priest added to those who have died for their love of Christ,' Bishop Martinez said. 'Enough already of so much pain, of so many murders. Enough already of so much crime. Enough extortions.' That was an apparent reference to the 'protection payments' that the local drug gang, the Knights Templar, demand from business owners in Ciudad Altamirano. A monument in honor of Mexico's former President Lazaro Cardenas stands along a highway between Arcelia and Ciudad Altamirano on the state border of Guerrero and Michoacan, Mexico . One business owner, who did not want to be named for fear of reprisals, said his family had been forced to pay thousands of pesos  each year to the gang for the right to operate a pharmacy. While the Rev. Jesus Mendoza Zaragoza said gangs have also demanded protection payments from parish priests in the nearby resort city of Acapulco, Lopez Gorostieta didn't have a parish or collect tithes. But Bishop Martinez said there could be other motives: Priests have received threats when they refuse to perform quickie marriages or baptisms for drug gang members.  The church normally requires extensive paperwork before performing such ceremonies. 'At times, if they ask for a baptism and you don't do it, they start to threaten you,' Martinez said. 'They want a marriage, or a blessing' for a car or a home, he said, and won't take 'no' for an answer. The Mexican Council of Bishops issued a statement saying 'we demand authorities clear up this and so many other crimes that have caused pain in so many homes, and ensure that it is punished.' But Mendoza Zaragoza said there appears to be little likelihood authorities will find the killers, because they haven't done so in past cases. 'The government offers to investigate, but nothing is ever known,' he said referring to the other recent killing of a priest in the Altamirano diocese. A view of the seminary in Ciudad Altamirano, Mexico, - Rev. Gregorio Lopez Gorostieta disappeared after he was apparently kidnapped from this local seminary on Monday . In September, the battered body of the Rev. Ascension Acuna Osorio was found floating in the Balsas river near his parish of San Miguel Totolapan, near Ciudad Altamirano. Guerrero state prosecutors said the priest's body had head wounds, but it was unclear whether they were caused by the body being dragged by the current, or whether he had been killed before being dumped in the river. Martinez said authorities never offered more information on the investigation into his death. Residents of San Miguel Totolapan told reporters that Acuna Osorio was well liked in the town, but they were afraid to speak more about his death, or the gang that operates in the area. The town is an area dominated by the Guerreros Unidos drug cartel, which has been implicated in the mass killing of 43 students in September in the nearby city of Iguala. The area is so dangerous that Martinez said one priest had been briefly kidnapped in the mountains above San Miguel Totolapan by cartel gunmen who complained the priest had been speaking in favor of 'La Familia' — the name of a rival drug cartel. The priest had to quickly explain he had been preaching in favor of family values, not the rival cartel. Nor have authorities cleared up the killing of a Ugandan priest whose body was found in a clandestine grave in a nearby Guerrero diocese in November. Father John Ssenyondo, 55, had been kidnapped about six months earlier. His body was later identified as one of 13 found in a clandestine grave discovered Nov. 2 in the town of Ocotitlan.

"Russian schoolboy Ilya Gavrichenko thought he was meant to be playing Joseph Stalin - not Joseph of Nazareth - in his school's Christmas play . When Russian schoolboy Ilya Gavrichenko told his parents he was playing Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin in his school production, they put together the perfect costume - moustache and all. It was only when he arrived on the night of the performance that they realised he was meant to be playing a very different role - Joseph of Nazareth. Ilya, who is 12, was dressed in a white shirt, jacket, military trousers and army boots when he arrived at the school in St Petersburg. With no time to change before the start of the nativity, he was left with no choice but to accompany the Virgin Mary to Bethlehem while dressed as the murderous tyrant. His father Fedor, who made the costume, said: 'We even got him a perfect moustache. 'We were all ready for him to be a success.' Despite the misunderstanding over the boy's part in the play, Ilya still kept the audience entertained with his performance. 'He was supposed to accompany the Virgin Mary but there was no time to change the outfit,' his father said. 'Each time he went out on stage, the mothers were in hysterics, crying and yowling from somewhere under their chairs. 'My son was lost because of mixing up the part he was playing, and feeling guilty for having done so.' Stalin ruled the USSR with an iron fist from 1922 to 1952 and was responsible for the deaths of millions of people. After the end of the Soviet Union, previously unseen official records revealed almost 800,000 people were executed under Stalin. A further 1.7 million people were killed in Gulag labour camps.

"Money worries and a ‘Hollywood ideal’ of relationships could lead to a rise in break-ups in the New Year, according to Relate. The counselling service says the stress and expense of trying to have a perfect Christmas can ‘add up and become this big pressure cooker that just explodes’. Calls to the service’s national phone line rose by 53 per cent on the first Monday of January 2014 compared with the first Monday of December 2013, with appointment bookings increasing by 86 per cent. Priscilla Sim, a relationships counsellor at Relate, said January is a time of reflection which many see as an opportunity for a new start. Money worries and a ‘Hollywood ideal’ of relationships could lead to a rise in break-ups in the New Year. File photo . She said: 'People are thinking about their lives, their relationships, and they kind of want to go into the new year fresh and they don't want to bring in all the burdens of the past year and the past few years if the relationship hasn't been going that well. 'So I think we see quite a high volume of calls in January due to that. It's kind of like, you have three choices: You either stay as things are, you leave the relationship or you try and change. And a lot of people do opt to try and change and work things out,' she said. Ms Sim said that along with other occasions such as Valentine's Day and anniversaries, Christmas can bring a lot of expectation and pressure. 'People want to have this great family time and sometimes it's just not like that. So it can be quite difficult, with particularly money worries. 'That's like the highest concern at the moment for people that have been surveyed in Relate surveys. I think 40% of people are worried about money and not being able to buy the right presents, having big arguments within families on Christmas Day. 'The pressure on couples to provide for children, if they want to get them the latest toy that's out or the latest computer games - things are expensive. Counselling service Relate says the stress and expense of trying to have a perfect Christmas can ‘add up and become this big pressure cooker that just explodes’. File photo . 'And inviting people round and making big dinners, all of that costs money. And that's just an extra pressure on the relationship when there's maybe stuff that's going on already for them. 'I think in society, in glossy magazines, and on TV, we're kind of expected to have this Hollywood ideal of relationships. 'So when they have an argument it's the end of the world, when actually research shows that arguments are healthy. Obviously if you're arguing all the time that's difficult, but I think the ratio is one in five. 'If you're having five positive interactions to one difficult interaction you've got a healthy relationship. It's important to have arguments because that shows that you're still two individual people,' she said. Ms Sim said sometimes people think that they 'should be having sex all the time', adding: 'Unfortunately, sometimes we're just too busy, we're just tired, it does fall off the agenda. But that doesn't mean that your relationship is doomed.' The counsellor said people should recognise a healthy relationship. 'Sometimes people do panic a little bit because they're given all of these messages - these messages from the media - and from society, that their relationship should be a certain way, when actually what they've got is really normal and actually really healthy,' she said. Ms Sim added: 'So I think the whole idea of never arguing, never fighting, having this perfect idea of Christmas, perfect idea of a relationship, perfect idea of a family, is really damaging, because then whenever anything goes wrong, it's like 'Well this isn't how it's supposed to be'.' Ruth Sutherland, chief executive of Relate, said: 'January is always very busy for Relate. Sadly many couples and families face a tough time over Christmas as people spend concentrated time together and that can bring any underlying issues bubbling to the surface. 'Also New Year is a time when many of us naturally assess how life is going and this can make people think about how their relationships are faring.' Earlier this year, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said the number of divorces in England and Wales in 2012 was 118,140, an increase of 0.5% since 2011, when there were 117,558 divorces. The number of divorces in 2012 was highest among men and women aged 40 to 44. For those married in 1972, 22% of marriages had ended in divorce by their 15th wedding anniversary, whereas for those married in 1997, almost a third of marriages had ended by this time, according to the ONS.

"It has been claimed that Sydney siege gunman Man Haron Monis had a long-running personal vendetta against Channel 7 and in particular their Sunrise program. Monis spent six years lobbying the Australian media watchdog over what he perceived were breaches of broadcasting regulations involving Sunrise news segments. The hostage-taker died along with two of the 17 hostages he took in the Lindt Cafe in Martin Place just metres from Channel 7's Sunrise studio last week. The attack took place so near 7's offices it prompted speculation the Sunrise studio was his target from the very beginning, but that his initial plans went awry. Fairfax revealed that the 50-year-old first complained in mid-2007 to the ACMA about a Sunrise program broadcast on July 4 of that year. Scroll down for video . Sunrise's David Koch consoles fellow presenter Natalie Barr after she breaksdown live on television during the Sydney siege . Monis' dispute with the ACMA and Seven back then apparently was not triggered by 7's current affairs expose of his anti-Afghan soldier letter-writing campaign and online videos in 2008, the Sydney Morning Herald reported. Rather his perceived hatred for the channel and Sunrise was that he alleged a guest on the program had commented about the Glasgow terror attacks and had indirectly provided instructions for terrorism and had therefore breached terrorism laws. Over the next six years he was obsessed with Sunrise and the area it was located in. During this time correspondence associated with the dispute about Seven and the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) that Monis sent to other authorities, contain numerous references to ‘Martin Place’ and ‘acts of terrorism’. Man Haron Monis had a personal vendetta with the Sunrise program since July 2007 . The Sunrise team have proven to be very popular with viewers . Lindt Cafe in Martin Place where the Sydney siege took place is just metres from Channel 7's Sunrise studio . For years afterwards Monis made reference to the Sunrise program. Throughout 2012, he maintained a website on which he posted just one statement which said: ‘That from 2001 I was silent, I was dead. ‘Until 4th July 2007 I was in a deep sleep. Sunrise woke me up! God can awaken a person by many different means even by a terrorist broadcast from the program Sunrise on Channel Seven from the Australian TV! I thank God and I won't give up until the Australian government condemns that broadcast which was instructing terrorism.’ Sunrise's regular hosts Samantha Armytage and David Koch . Monis sent numerous ranting letters to authorities complaining about Sunrise's coverage . In later ranting letters to other authorities about the Channel 7 program he bemoaned the failure’ of it to investigate ‘terrorist acts at Martin Place, Sydney, Australia’. A spokesman for Channel 7 said the station was making no comment on Monis while the siege investigation was ongoing. Sunrise in its current format began in 2002. It’s presented by David Koch and Samantha Armytage and follows Seven Early News. Runing from 6am to 9am, it’s followed by The Morning Show.

"A woman who admitting building makeshift pipe bombs said she did it because it was her 'passion'. Celia Savage, 24, who said she built explosive devices at her home as a 'hobby', pleaded guilty to making and possessing two pipe bombs yesterday. When federal agents asked Savage what there was to do where she lived in north Georgia, she replied: 'Blow things up', court documents showed. 'Passion': Celia Savage, 24, pleaded guilty to making and possessing two pipe bombs in Georgia . Pipe bombs: Savage, second from right, is seen leaving federal court after pleading guilty to the two firearms charges in Georgia . Savage entered the plea after reaching an agreement with prosecutors, and will be sentenced at a later date. A police raid on Savage's home in May last year discovered . a number of guns along with the two pipe bombs, as well as illegal drug . paraphernalia, numerous pills, and substances believed to be . methamphetamine and marijuana, court documents said. Savage said she had used marijuana the day before the raid, and methamphetamine around two months before, according to a statement from a federal agent. The statement said she told police she had made between five and seven pipe bombs of different sizes, and a 'cherry bomb' - a tennis ball filled with gun powder. 'Hobby': When asked by federal agents what there is to do in her home town in Georgia, Savage replied 'blow things up' Savage said she knew it was wrong or against the law to make the devices, but that it was her hobby and that she was passionate about it, a report on ajc.com said. During the hearing yesterday, Savage attempted to tell the judge she had no malicious intent towards anybody. District Judge Richard Story said she would have the opportunity to speak at her sentencing hearing. Savage declined to comment after the hearing. Attorney Sally Quillian Yates said in a statement: 'Making bombs out of . heavy metal pipe, explosive powder, and fuses is a serious crime, not a . hobby, that carries significant penalties.' Savage is understood to have been out on bond for around a year. The conditions of her release demanded that she reside with her grandparents and be confined to their home at all times with the exception of work, medical appointments or court appearances. A judge last week amended the condition, imposing a curfew from 1am to 8am. Prosecutor William McKinnon told the judge the charges against Savage carry a penalty of up to 10 years in prison and a maximum $250,000 fine. The prosecutor said after the hearing that the plea agreement indicates Savage should serve between 57 and 71 months in jail. The judge is not bound by the agreement.","Celia Savage, from north Georgia, pleaded guilty to making two pipe bombs .

"A 15-year-old girl who miraculously survived a bear attack has credited her dog Ralph with saving her life by lunging at the animal while she played dead. Leah Reeder sustained deep bites and gouges to her legs, back, neck and face, after the attack on Sunday in Eastpoint, Franklin County, on Florida's panhandle. She was out walking Ralph, a springer spaniel, at 6pm when the bear suddenly appeared and tackled her. Speaking to the Apalach Times from her hospital bed, she said the bear pushed her down, and she rolled on to her front side and started screaming. Scroll down for video . Injured: Leah Reeder, pictured, said her dog Ralph managed to scare away a bear that attacked her as they took a walk. After pretending to play dead, her dog started yapping and lunging at the bear, she said . Heroic: After coming face-to-face with the 25-pound springer spaniel, the bear took off into the woods, she said . 'I guess nobody heard me,' she said. 'After I realized nobody was coming, I stopped screaming, and it started dragging me to the ditch.' Then she remembered something she had been taught at school. 'In school they teach you to play dead. I just did that, and it worked,' she told ABC News. 'It stopped biting me as soon as I stopped screaming.' Then it was up to Ralph to finish off the job. The 25-pound dog started yapping and lunching at the bear, which Leah believes scared the bear away. The creature walked backwards, fell into a ditch and then walked off. Unsure whether or not it was coming back, she continued to play dead but eventually managed to make her way to her father's house. Her parents called 911. Recovering: Leah, pictured before the attack, sustained deep bites and gouges to her legs, back, neck and face and needed hundreds of stitches after the incident, but she is now back home with her family . Scene: Investigators can be seen the scene of the attack. The Wildlife Commission went on to kill the bear . Her mother Sheri Mann told the Apalach Times: 'It bit her face open, and beside her ear on her scalp. It was very, very bad. Even as I sit here now, I can't believe it happened.' Leah has undergone hours of surgery and has hundreds of stitches for the wounds to her neck, head, back and arms - but she was back home for Christmas. 'She managed to crack a few smiles at me before she went in for surgery,' Mann told WMBB.

The other woman was taken to a hospital, where authorities say she was in critical condition Friday. The CHP is investigating the cause of the crash. 'Everything was just tossed around. It's very difficult for us to investigate,' CHP spokesman Officer Chad Hertzell said.

"A Russian photographer who was accused of murdering his glamour model wife before dumping her body in a woodland has been freed. Dmitry Loshagin was the only suspect after the naked body of 28-year-old Yulia Loshagina was found in the Ural mountains in Russia, her neck broken and face burnt beyond recognition. Her wounds were so severe that her body could only be identified by DNA. Arrested: Dmitry Loshagin was the only suspect after the naked body of his wife Yulia Loshagina, 28, was found in the Ural mountains in Russia . Mr Loshagin was arrested in Yekaterinburg, Russia's fourth largest city, in September last year and held in custody while police investigated the death and the case was brought to trial . Mr Loshagin was arrested in Yekaterinburg, Russia's fourth largest city, in September last year and held in custody while police investigated the death and the case was brought to trial. But yesterday, Mr Loshagin, 39, was dramatically freed by judge Eduard Izmaylov, who decided that there was not enough evidence to convict the man of murder. He has always maintained his innocence and denied any part in his wife's brutal murder. Speaking outside court today, Mr Loshagin claimed that he was framed for murder, adding that he wants to get back to 'normal life', according to The Siberian Times. He said: 'I endured my wife's death, horrific accusations, betrayal and humiliation. I have spent 15 and a half months in prison. I simply want to get back to my normal life. I loved my wife.' The couple were seen quarreling at a rooftop party at the £1million loft penthouse they shared in August last year. Brutal: Miss Loshagin's neck was broken and face was burnt beyond recognition when police found her body in the woods . Suspect: Mr Loshagin pictured with his late wife. The model's wounds were so severe that her body could only be identified by DNA . Prosecutors alleged that Mr Loshagin killed his wife in a drunken rage after finding out that she was unfaithful. They claimed that he dumped her body some 30 miles away in the woodlands near Pervouralsk the following day. His mobile phone was found to have been used in the area close to where her body was later found by police. An hour before she was killed, she was violently raped, according to medical evidence heard at his trial. Her face and hands was so badly disfigured that her body could only be identified by DNA. Loshagin, who frequently photographed his wife for Russian glamour magazines, was the only murder suspect, and claimed that he was framed for the murder. Mr Loshagin, pictured in the dock during the court case, frequently photographed his wife for Russian glamour magazines . He has now been dramatically freed by judge Eduard Izmaylov (left and right) who decided that there was not enough evidence to convict the man of murder . During the trial (pictured),the defendant had always maintained his innocence and denied any part in his wife's brutal murder . He insisted that he had told investigators his suspicions over who murdered his wife and hid her body. He claimed that at the party he overheard his wife take a call from a mystery man who he assumed to be her lover. He said the pair had agreed to meet at Moscovsky Trakt, near the forest where he body was later found. Loshagin said that he decided to speak to his wife later rather than speak to her at the party, but that she left without talking to him. He alleged he searched her suitcase and found some white powder which, he claims, he emptied into the toilet, leaving no traces. Suffered: An hour before she was killed, Miss Loshagin, above, was violently raped, according to medical evidence heard at his trial . Prosecutors alleged that Mr Loshagin killed his wife in a drunken rage after finding out that she was unfaithful . One of the allegations leaked was an extraordinary claim that Mr Loshagin had killed his lover because she had infected him with AIDS. It was later discovered that both were uninfected when she died . Another was that she died during a bizarre sex session with Loshagin, but again there was no evidence presented in court to support this allegation . According to his version, his wife was carrying cocaine for a gang but 'something went wrong, and Yulia was killed'. He claimed that the reason his phone signal was located in the area was because he went looking for her. Mrs Loshagina's mother and brother Mikhail claimed that Mr Loshagin was 'constantly changing his story' after she disappeared. They were frantically looking for her, but claimed he declined to help. When her corpse was found, he said he could not attend the identification because he was at a 'presentation' of his photographs. The case attracted lurid attention in Russia with allegations leaked by investigators to newspapers, among them an extraordinary claim that he had killed her because she had infected him with AIDS. Allegations: Mr Loshagin, pictured with his wife (right) and at their wedding (left) claimed that at the party he overheard his wife take a call from a mystery man who he assumed to be her lover . Now Loshagin's mother-in-law, Svetlana Ryabova, intends to formally challenge the verdict, alleging a taped confession made by Loshagin was not used as evidence in the trial . Loshagin's smiling mother pictured after the verdict. Her son had spent 15 months in prison . It was later discovered that both were uninfected when she died. Another was that she died during a bizarre sex session with Loshagin, but again there was no evidence presented in court other than the discovery of two sex toys in the flat the couple shared. Yet another claim was that Mrs Loshagina was killed by a professional assassin hired by an alleged lover, an unnamed 'elderly' local. Investigators previously discounted claims she had a secret boyfriend but will now be forced to examine if she was sexually involved with another man. Prosecutors had demanded 13 years in jail for Loshagin. In around 98 per cent of cases in Russia, the courts follow the demands of state prosecutors. Now Loshagin's mother-in-law, Svetlana Ryabova, intends to formally challenge the verdict, alleging a taped confession made by Loshagin was not used as evidence in the trial. 'I will appeal,' she said. Prosecutors are also expected to press for a retrial, said reliable sources.

"The parents of a gay son whose death they feel responsible for and who have dedicated their lives to helping members of the LGBTQ community and their parents are being attacked by people who say they killed their son. Rob and Linda Robertson of Redmond, Washington, learned their son Ryan was gay when he came out to them at just 12-years-old, but the devout Christians lived by the Bible, and as a result did everything they could to tech their son that he could fight his urges. In the end he could not, and Ryan died of a drug overdose when he was just 20-years-old, something they frequently write and speak about, expressing how ashamed they are and how much they wished they had done everything differently. After sharing their story however, Linda writes that she and her husband have been called 'f-king murderers, child abusers, people who should never have been parents, and self-obsessed narcissists, who demanded apologies from our son, without ever realizing that we were the ones who had wronged him.' They have also been told 'that we might as well have shot our son, point blank, before he came out, because that would have been more merciful than what we did do.' Linda responded to these attacks by saying she was shocked by the comments, but feels wretched and full of guilt and every single day realizes and has to live with the knowledge of how wrong she and her husband were in their treatment of their son. Gone to soon: Ryan Robertson (above) died of a drug overdose when he was 20 . Guilt: His parents, Linda and Rob Robertson (above), feel partially responsible as they thought Ryan should fight his homosexuality after coming out to them at just 12-year-old . Fighting the urge: Ryan would meet weekly with his pastor and attend reparative therapy in a bid to stop being gay . The Roberstons now travel around the country and are dedicated to helping other evangelical parents accept their gay children. While they make it clear they never stopped loving their son, they do regret not accepting him for who he was. They encouraged him to fight his feelings while attending reparative therapy and meetings with his pastor weekly as a teenager. 'Basically, we told our son that he had to choose between Jesus and his sexuality,' said Linda. And while this worked for some time, in the end Ryan could not deny his sexuality. This led to him running off and using drugs when he was just a teenager they say, and going over a year without speaking to either of his parents. 'Suddenly our fear of Ryan someday having a boyfriend (a possibility that honestly terrified me) seemed trivial in contrast to our fear of Ryan’s death, especially in light of his recent rejection of Christianity, and his mounting anger at God,' wrote Linda on her Facebook page. When Ryan came back though after 18 long months, the family did accept him, and his boyfriends, but sadly their time together was short lived. Just 10 months after returning Ryan overdosed after a night out with his old friends. He died after 17 days in the hospital. Memories: Now Linda and Rob travel around the country and are dedicated to helping other evangelical parents accept their gay children . Wise words: 'I grieve, not only for my oldest son, who I will miss every day for the rest of my life, but for the mistakes I made,' wrote Linda on her Facebook . 'Now, when I think back on the fear that governed all my reactions during those first six years after Ryan told us he was gay, I cringe as I realize how foolish I was. I was afraid of all the wrong things,' wrote Linda. 'And I grieve, not only for my oldest son, who I will miss every day for the rest of my life, but for the mistakes I made. I grieve for what could have been, had we been walking by FAITH instead of by FEAR.' Rob and Linda are now leaders of an HIV/AIDS Local Outreach Team, contributors to the website Biola Queer Underground, have started an LGBTQ group at their church, and speak out on behalf of the LGBTQ community around the country.","Rob and Linda Robertson  have devoted their lives to helping Christian parents accept their gay children after losing their gay son to an overdose .

"When Christina Beckett learned that her husband had accidentally misplaced an SD card containing irreplaceable pictures of their newborn son, she was certain she would never see them again. 'I was heartbroken,' the young mother from Virginia tearfully said, recalling the moment a few weeks ago when her husband, Chris, told her he had inadvertently slipped the SD card into a videogame case and later traded the game in. Mrs Beckett, of Newport News, was devastated by the loss because the memory card contained photos documenting the first two months of their son Peyton's life, including him on the scales immediately after delivery and photos of Christina cradling him in her arms for the first time. Scroll down for video . Fail: Chris and Christina Beckett were certain they would never see their son's first photos after the husband accidentally misplaced them . Oops: Chris Beckett, of Virginia, inadvertently slipped an SD card containing photos of his newborn son inside an Xbox videogame case . Irreplaceable: The memory card contained photos covering the first two months of Peyton Beckett's life . Slip-up: Beckett has traded in the videogame at this Gamestop store in Newport News, not realizing the camera chip was still inside . Chris Beckett explained that he had purchased the Xbox game Destiny and unthinkingly tucked the memory card from the couple's camera behind a tab inside the case. Earlier this month, Beckett took the videogame down to the Gamestop store at the Jefferson Commons mall and traded it on, unaware that the memory card with the precious baby pictures was still inside. ‘I just kept saying, “I can’t believe you did this, I can’t believe you did this,”’ Christina told NewsChannel3 last week. The new mother raced to the game store in her pajamas that night to try and track down the Xbox game while her husband was busy tearing apart their home in search of the SD card. But all of their efforts were in vain: the illusive chip was nowhere to be found. After exhausting all possible avenues of locating the card, the Becketts offered a $200 reward to the person who returns their misplaced SD card. And just in time for Christmas, the Becketts received the good news: their precious photos have been recovered. Reunited: Two days before Christmas, Christina Beckett was contacted by Zach Zimmerman (right) telling him he was the one who had purchased the traded-in game with their SD card . Happy end: Mrs BEckett handed the Good Samaritan a $200 reward for coming forward . New life: Among the photos found on the recovered card was this image of newborn Peyton immediately after delivery . Christmas miracle: Christina Beckett said having the photos of her son back in her possession is the perfect Christmas gift . The couple were contacted this week by Zach Zimmerman, a gamer who had purchased Chris Beckett’s traded-in Xbox game. Zimmerman said he noticed at once the memory card tucked behind a tab, but then completely forgot about it until he saw NewsChannel 3's report about the Becketts’ lost pictures. On Tuesday, an overjoyed Christina Beckett met with Zimmerman at the Gamestop store and was at last reunited with the illusive card. ‘I could not have asked for a better Christmas gift.’ Beckett gushed. A grateful Zach Zimmerman claimed his $200 reward, telling Mrs Beckett that she has just doubled his income, and that now he will be able to buy Christmas presents.","Chris Beckett, of Virginia, inadvertently slipped SD card containing photos of son Peyton inside videogame case .

"Islamic militants have fired rockets from speedboats at Libya's largest port in an attempt to seize control of the fiercely contested resource amid warnings the country is descending into chaos like that in Syria. Last night a rocket set three storage tanks ablaze at the eastern Libyan oil port of Al-Sidra as armed factions allied to competing governments fought over control of the country's biggest export terminal. Rebels from a group called Libya Dawn, which helped to topple Muammar Gaddafi in 2011, seized control of the capital Tripoli in August - exiling the internationally recognised government east. Scroll down for video . The massive storage tank at the exporting port of Al-Sidra burns after it was struck by rocket fire . Only one tank was struck by rockets, but the intense fire led to two other tanks (pictured) bursting into flames . Firefighters stand by as the flames continue to rage. The tank was struck after militants tried to seize control of the port in a speedboat attack . Firefighters try to contain parts of the fire after the intense blaze spread to two other storage tanks . The group, which is responsible for the attack which left the tanks ablaze, are now engaged in a bitter power struggle with the incumbent government fought primarily over the country's resources. Ali Hassi, spokesman for a security service allied to the country's east-based internationally-recognised government, said the rival force tried taking the Al-Sidra with speedboats, opening fire on an oil tank. Ismail al-Shukri, a spokesman for the rival force, said it had launched a new push to take the ports but denied it had sent boats or shot at any storage tanks. He blamed the other side, saying aircraft had attacked the tank. 'A tank was hit but the damage is limited,' Hassi said, adding that the advance had been stopped with aircraft and ground troops. Clashes were also reported from Sirte, a city west of Al-Sidra, killing up to 19, among them 14 guards at a power plant, residents said. Meanwhile Libya, torn by the growing political divide that threatens to engulf its oilfields, could become the next Syria if it does not patch its divided government and get help battling Islamic militants, the country's foreign minister said this week. A Libyan soldier looks at the body bag of a fellow soldier killed during clashes with militant forces in Benghazi . Doctors, nurses and other emergency services personnel tend to an injured Libyan soldier . 'If we don't do the right thing now, in two years' time we could have - hopefully not - a repeat of what happened in Syria in 2014 because the international community didn't react adequately,' Foreign Minister Mohamed Dayri said. In an ominous turn of events, a force allied to the self-declared Libya Dawn government earlier this month moved to seize Libya's two biggest oil export ports, Al-Sidra and Ras Lanuf. Fighting has since spread to a third oil port. Dayri repeated his government's charge that forces attacking the oil facilities included elements of Ansar al-Sharia - a group the U.S. has designated as terrorists suspected of being involved in the deadly September 2012 attack on the U.S. diplomatic compound in Benghazi. The fighting has reduced Libya's crude output to 352,000 barrels a day, a spokesman for state National Oil Corp said, adding that only the Brega, Sarir, Messla and offshore operations were still producing. Al-Sidra and Ras Lanuf ports - now closed due to the conflict - had previously been processing an estimated 300,000 barrels per day. Commanders of armed groups operating in Libya have been warned they could face prosecution for possible war crimes including execution and torture. The United Nations claims hundreds of civilians have been killed in fighting since late August, when Libya Dawn seized control of the capital Tripoli. The North African country is struggling with fighting on several fronts as brigades of former rebels who battled side by side to oust Muammar Gaddafi in 2011 now clash for political power and a share of oil revenues. The conflict has driven at least 120,000 people from their homes and caused a humanitarian crisis, said a joint report by the U.N. human rights office and U.N. Support Mission in Libya  that also documents shelling of civilian areas. The toll includes an estimated 100 people killed and 500 wounded in fighting between rival armed groups in Warshefana, an area near Tripoli 'perceived to be harbouring many Gaddafi supporters as well as common criminals', between late August and early October. A further 170 were killed and hundreds injured in fighting in the Nafusa mountains to the southwest, it said. Some 450 people have been killed in Benghazi since fighting escalated in mid-October. Hospitals there have been shelled or occupied by armed groups. And since mid-October, the Libyan army and forces loyal to former general Khalifa Haftar have been waging a war to retake the eastern coastal city, held by Islamist groups.","Islamic militants launch coastal rocket attacks on oil port from speedboats .

"Confessed: Dustin Lee Klopp, 36, confessed to murdering his wife with an ax on Christmas Eve . A man allegedly axed his wife to death on Christmas Eve then took their children to his parents house to celebrate the holiday before calling the police to confess his crime a day later. Dustin Lee Klopp, 36, reportedly punched his wife Stephanie Kilhefner in the face then used an ax to cut her throat and slice open her head at around 10 p.m. during an argument on Wednesday evening. Lancaster County District Attorney Craig Stedman said the two children, ages five and two, didn't see heir mother die a horrific death. Stedman wouldn't say what Klopp and Kilhhefner were arguing about. 'I know what he said ... What difference does it make? There's nothing that justifies it,' he said. According to Pennsylvania State Police, Klopp attempted to clean his wife's splattered blood from their home at 623 Georgetown Road. Klopp then allegedly moved his wife's body into a shed and placed it in a car-carrier bag, reports Lancaster Online. Klopp called police to confess to- his wife's murder on Thursday at around 5:20 p.m. and arrived at the station at 6:30 p.m. It's unknown as to whether he confessed his crime to his parents or anyone else before turning himself into the police. 'I can't think of another one like this where (nearly a day goes by) and we get a phone call before we even know there's a crime,' said District Attorney Craig Stedman. Stedman said that people usually call in self-defense following a homicide which was not the case in this instance. Klopp has been charged with homicide and tampering with evidence, reports Wgal.com. This isn’t Klopp's first brush with the law. In 2009 Klopp was arrested on drug charges and served a 2-4 year prison term before being released in 2011, the same year he married his wife of three years. Murdered: Dustin Lee Klopp, 36, reportedly punched his wife Stephanie Kilhefner (pictured) in the face then used an ax to cut her throat and slice open her head at around 10 p.m. on Wednesday evening .

Klopp's criminal record also includes two guilty pleas to DUI in 2007 along with one plea to resisting arrest. He pleaded guilty in 1997 to burglary and simple assault and in 2001 he pleaded guilty to burglary and resisting arrest. Klopp's lawyer said he was surprised to hear about the alleged murder based on Klopp's character. 'They both seemed to be very level-headed individuals,' he said. '... He never struck me as a violent individual.' Each Klopp and Kilhefner's Facebook accounts are filled with seemingly happy family images just days before the gruesome killing.

"The severity of California's current drought has been realized by the release of two NASA pictures of Folsom Lake and the desolation it has suffered in just two and a half years. The reservoir, located northeast of Sacremento, California, can be seen almost full on July 20, 2011, measuring a capacity of 97 percent. But in a shot taken just last month, the lake had a capacity of just 17 percent. The devastating images have added to the need for the west coast to better manage its water resources, with the record drought forcing a state of emergency and NASA now working to help the crisis. Scroll down for video . Before: In 2011, the Californian dam was almost full, sitting at a capacity of 97 percent . After: The capacity of Folsom Lake in January was just 17 percent, a whopping 80 percent lower than what it was 2.5 years ago . Record drought: These satellite images show the . parched California landscape this year compared to a normal year with . plenty of foliage and snow coverage last year . California's drought continues to worsen, with ten rural communities identified as having fewer than 60 days' supply of water . According to the Christian Science Monitor, ten rural communities have fewer than 60 days' water supply. Water deliveries to 750,000 acres of farmland and 25 million people have been halted, with the carryover water from last year that is in reservoirs to be channeled to the farmers and . several towns that get their water from the State Water Project. Furthermore homeowners are drilling thousands of wells to pump water from aquifers that are historically depleted. Last week Gov. Jerry Brown unveiled a proposed $687.4-million drought-relief package to free up water supplies and aid Californians facing financial ruin because of the prolonged dry spell. The proposal would provide millions of dollars to clean up drinking water, improve conservation and make irrigation systems more efficient. It would also increase penalties for those who illegally divert water and provide emergency food and housing. But the package plan came after farmers faced the driest year in more than a century. Farmers in California’s Central Valley, the world’s most productive agricultural region, will get none of the water they requested this year from a federally controlled system because of the drought. The U.S. Interior Department’s Bureau of Reclamation said last week it won’t be able to deliver any of the more than 2.4 million acre-feet of water sought by farmers, according to AG Web. A state-controlled system last month said it, too, wouldn’t be able to deliver any of the 4 million acre-feet of water sought by local agencies . The result will hundreds of thousands of acres of farmland die, boosting food prices across the U.S. and leaving farm workers jobless.

California's relationship with NASA began shortly after the dry year of 2009, when officials sought answers to problems exacerbated by the lack of rain and snow, such as the sinking land. year's drought has made that research all more important, Jones said, adding that the preliminary findings proved that there's plenty more to learn. NASA geologist Tom Farr said that bringing together all types of research and modern technology like pieces of a puzzle may help those in charge of managing the state's water supply avoid deficit water years like this.

Lawrence Friedl, director of NASA's Applied Sciences Program, said that 13 of the agency's satellites are focused on water. Three more water research projects are scheduled by NASA, including a satellite to be launched Feb. 27 with the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency. Projects NASA is advancing include measuring so-called ""atmospheric rivers"" to better predict global storm systems farther in advance so rain can be captured in California reservoirs. Satellite images that show the amount of land farmers have chosen not to plant in a drought will arm officials in Sacramento with information about where to open food banks for farm workers. Satellites technology will help officials identify levees that are prone to break with high volumes of water, scientists said. As Ed Osan, senior policy analyst with the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC), explains, metropolitan cities like Los Angeles, San Francisco and San Diego have been largely unnafectted because they started developing ways to catch and retain water following the drought from 1987 to 1992. In 2003, California signed onto a new water-sharing agreement that included 'the largest transfer of water from agricultural use to urban use in US history,' according to the Association of California Water Agencies. 'California cities really got their act together and began coming up with formal drought plans two decades ago,' says Timothy Quinn, ACWA executive director. 'Now, they’re reaping the benefits of that planning.' California is under the influence of a persistent upper-level ridge of high pressure anchored off its north coast that has kept the region generally warm, dry and clear.Nearly four miles high and 2,000 miles long, is to blame for the emerging drought as the mass of high air pressure has been blocking Pacific winter storms from coming ashore and bringing much needed to bring rain to the parched West Coast.The mass of high air pressure has been blocking Pacific winter storms from coming ashore in California, pushing them into Alaska and British Columbia - it is even responsible for rain and cold weather to the East Coast.Similar high-pressure zones pop up all the time during most winters, but they usually break down, allowing rain to get through to California.The duration of its presence - 13 months - is unprecedented in modern weather records and puzzling researchers - it has been named the 'ridiculously resilient ridge.'Source: Sci-Tech Today .

"A Russian university is planning to create a 'Noah's Ark' consisting of the frozen DNA of every creature that has ever lived. Moscow State University has received the country's largest-ever scientific grant to embark on the project, which is scheduled to be completed by 2018 and will be based in a 430sq km site on campus. The institute, which has received 1billion rubles (£12.6million) to help get it off the ground, aims to cryogenically freeze and store cells which are capable of reproducing. The 'Noah's Ark' project aims to collect cellular materials from every creature to have ever lived . Viktor Sadivnichy, the university's rector, likened the gigantic project to a modern-day 'Noah's Ark', RT reported. He explained: 'It will involve the creation of a depository - a databank for the storing of every living thing on Earth, including not only living, but disappearing and distinct organisms. 'It will also contain information systems. If it's realised, this will be a leap in Russian history as the first nation to create an actual Noah's Ark of sorts.' The announcement marks the latest, and most ambitious, of the world's DNA banks which have increased in numbers in the past decade following breakthroughs in technology and growing concern about species extinction. These are known as frozen zoos - the most well known of which is that at San Diego Zoo. Staff at the research centre have sperm, DNA and other animal matter frozen in liquid nitrogen since 1976. It currently holds about 8,400 samples from over 800 species. Britain also maintains the Frozen Ark Project, which is run by a consortium of biological societies, zoos, museums and research facilities. Its website states preserved viable cells will enable biologists to 'reverse the dangerous loss of genetic variation that can cause infertility and early death in breeding programmes'. The enormous DNA database will be held in a building at Moscow University Campus (pictured) It holds a remarkable 28,604 frozen DNA samples, of which more than 7,000 are from species on the 'red list' of endangered animals. This includes the Spiny Lobster, the Channel Islands Fox, the Bonefish, the Indiana Bat and Cat's Paw Coral. But Russia's historic Noah's Ark project is not the first of its kind for the country - a storage facility in the remote Siberian wilderness aims to use the natural cold of Siberia's thick permafrost to preserve seed and plant samples for up to 100 years. At least 1.5million seeds from plants and vegetables will be housed in the cryostorage unit in Yakutsk, protecting many of the world's important foods and endangered plant life against climate change, war, and disaster. There is already a small unit containing 100,000 samples (pictured) on the site, but a new extension will mean many more seeds can be stored .","The world's most ambitious DNA bank will be created at Russian University .

"Clayton Lockett was killed in a botched execution in April this year . It was the horrific execution which  opponents thought would spell the end to capital punishments across three conservative states in the U.S. As Clayton Lockett lay writhing under the influence of the lethal drugs, the execution turned into such a 'bloody mess' that the state tried to stop it before it was over. But despite the harrowing scenes of the botched execution in Oklahoma - and other troubling ones this year across Ohio and Arizona - there appears to have been no change of heart in the feeling towards capital punishment in the three states. Although Gov. Mary Fallin suspended further executions while Lockett's death and Oklahoma's methods were reviewed, the state is scheduled to resume killing inmates in mid-January. It came after officials hosted a ribbon-cutting ceremony for the media, in which they gave a tour of the renovated execution unit at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary, just six months after Lockett's death. Rather than sparking debate over capital punishment, the issues have actually led the states to explore new, old and more efficient ways of killing, including gassing inmates. Lydia Polley, a longtime member of the Oklahoma Coalition to Abolish the Death Penalty, said: . 'I think we had a little flash of hope that it would help our cause, but all it did was generate a lot of conversation about it. It just led to people thinking of better ways to kill them.' In Oklahoma, which is deeply conservative, Lockett's execution did little or nothing to dampen support for the death penalty. The state has killed more inmates than any other state except Texas since the 1976 reinstatement of the death penalty. In October, six months after Lockett's death, the execution unit was given a $104,000 overhaul. It now stands in sharp contrast to the rest of the shabby, 106-year-old facility. Even after the upgrades, Oklahoma's Republican-led House conducted a study on the use of nitrogen gas to execute inmates. It is expected to consider a piece of legislation early next year that would make Oklahoma the first state to adopt hypoxia by gas — the forced deprivation of oxygen — as a legal execution method. Other conservative states also are exploring alternatives to lethal injection because of the problems securing the drugs. U.S. states have had to buy made-to-order execution drugs from compounding pharmacies in recent years because the pharmaceutical companies they used to buy their drugs from refuse to sell them for use in lethal injections. The execution chamber at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary in McAlester, Okla after its renovation (file picture) Tennessee passed a law this year to reinstate the electric chair if it can't get lethal injection drugs and Utah is considering bringing back the firing squad. Oklahoma has executed 194 inmates since achieving statehood in 1907, including one by hanging, 82 by electrocution and 111 by lethal injection, according to state prison records. But the use of the death penalty was common in the territory long before that. U.S. District Judge Isaac Parker, who operated out of nearby Fort Smith, earned a reputation as the 'Hanging Judge' of the old West and presided over certain crimes committed in Indian territory. 'To me it's a reflection of our frontier culture,' said Oklahoma historian Bob Blackburn. 'Violence is a part of frontier culture, and vigilante justice has always been a strong element of our history.' Ralph Shortey, a Republican state senator from Oklahoma City who is pushing for Oklahoma to adopt alternative execution methods to lethal injection, estimates that 90 percent of his constituents strongly support the death penalty, despite what happened to Lockett. 'The average Oklahoman is saying he got exactly what he deserves,' Shortey said. 'A lot of people think they should suffer even more than they do. They think the lethal injection is too easy for them.' Oklahoma prison officials say they've secured the drugs they need to execute the next four inmates — the first is scheduled for Jan. 15 — unless a federal appeals court stands in their way. The inmates are trying to stop their executions, arguing that the state would essentially be experimenting on them by injecting them with unproven and untested drugs, as well as violating the constitutional ban on cruel and unusual punishment. Richard Dieter is the director of the Death Penalty Information Center, a Washington-based advocacy group that opposes capital punishment. He said: 'Just because you say you've renovated the execution chamber, doesn't mean a judge will be satisfied that you've identified the problems and have a strong guarantee they won't happen again. 'They may be optimistic about being able to go forward, but I think there are still a lot of questions out there.'

"Missouri Democratic Gov. Jay Nixon forcefully pushed back Tuesday against his Republican Lieutenant Governor Peter Kinder, saying it's 'false and absurd' to suggest he failed to deploy National Guard troops Monday in downtown Ferguson, Missouri because the Obama administration intervened. 'Politics has nothing to do with what anyone up here is doing,' Nixon insisted, referring to police commanders standing behind hi, during a mid-afternoon press conference. 'Politics has not one bit to do with the tasks at hand ... with the seriousness of this mission,' he said. Kinder had accused the Obama administration on Monday night of pressuring Nixon into keeping militarized guardsmen out of the riot zone as buildings in Ferguson burned, police cars were set alight and gunfire pierced the night's chaos. Nixon also dodged a question on Tuesday about whether or not guardsmen were positioned in downtown Ferguson before chaos erupted. 'Politics has not one bit to do with the tasks at hand,' Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon insisted when confronted with questions about whether the federal government had leaned on him to keep National Guard troops out of downtown Ferguson . Missouri Lt. Gov. Peter Kinder said Monday night that the only reason National Guard troops were kept out of Ferguson was pressure from the Obama administration . OUT OF DANGER: National Guard troops were stationed everywhere but Ferguson's central business district on Monday . Nixon officially mobilized the Missouri National Guard a week ago but their duties on Monday were restricted to keeping the peace at a courthouse, patrolling the outskirts of town and preventing disturbances in other suburbs. Only Tuesday morning did the guard's camouflaged humvees roll down West Florissant Avenue where rioters had looted, torched and smashed countless businesses – and fired weapons in the direction of first responders. Nixon sidestepped a reporter's request to comment on whether Guard troops were present on West Florissant Avenue, Ferguson's main commercial street, before the grand jury decision was announced Monday night. He said, however, that 700 guardsmen were deployed Monday to 100 locations – mostly command posts – so that other law enforcement personnel were freed up to manage riots. Nixon added that Tuesday night's deployment had been upped to 2,200. Kinder, however, was apoplectic on Monday. Nixon 'declared a State of Emergency almost a week ago and mobilized the National Guard,' he told a Fox News Channel audience. 'Then they were kept away at the crucial time while Ferguson burned.' 'We know they were kept away because they did not come in and stop that from the get-go. They were deployed in other parts of the St. Louis region,' he said. 'Why were they not in there at the first sign of an overturned police car or a smashed police car window with a show of force that would have stopped this?' The lawlessness began after a grand jury declined after a grand jury declined to indict a white police officer in the shooting death of a black teen who attacked him. OUT OF SIGHT: This National Guard humvee was photographed in Clayton, Missouri on Tuesday – 13 miles away from Ferguson – near the county courthouse where grad jurors made their decision . OUT OF FERGUSON: These guardsmen were posted in nearby Dellwood, Missouri on Tuesday but never ventured into the urban war zone . 'A NATION OF COWARDS': Attorney General Eric Holder (left) visited Ferguson's city center in late August but reportedly pressured Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon to keep the National Guard from following suit . Rioters burned buildings, fired guns at police officers and firefighters, looted and set police cars ablaze. 'Here's my question that the governor must answer,' Kinder demanded: 'Is the reason that the national guard was not in there because the Obama administration and the Holder Justice Department leaned on you to keep them out?' 'I cannot imagine any other reason why the governor who mobilized the National Guard would not have them in [downtown Ferguson] to stop this before it started.' Kinder is a Republican. Nixon is a Democrat. In Missouri the two offices are elected separately. The Obama Department of Justice, led by outgoing Attorney General Eric Holder, expressed frustration a week ago after Nixon held a press conference to announce that he had called the guard up to active duty. A top Holder aide called Nixon's office to relay the message, according to The Washington Post. 'Instead of de-escalating the situation, the governor escalated it,' a DOJ official told the Post. 'He sent the wrong message. The tone of the press conference was counterproductive.' WRONG NEIGHBORHOOD? Guardsmen kept watch outside a shopping mall on Tuesday . PROTECTING THE SYSTEM: Members of Missouri National Guard patrolled outside the Buzz Westfall Justice Center before the announcement of the grand jury decision . Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon buckled to pressure from Washington and kept his state's National Guard unit on the sidelines, according to the lieutenant governor . As his town descended into burning chaos, Ferguson Mayor James Knowles grew angry at the absence of National Guard troops. He told reporters that he could not reach state government officials to get help. 'I've called every number that I've got ... All I've been able to do is leave messages,' he told KTVI-TV2 in St. Louis. 'They were deployed at other parts of the St. Louis region ... Why were they not in [Ferguson] at the first sign of an overturned police car or a smashed police car window with a show of force that would have stopped this?' 'I’ve requested the National Guard troops to come out from the command post to help restore order along the business district,' he insisted. 'We have not seen that.' 'It’s my understanding that the commanders out on the street have requested this, and those calls have gone unheeded at this point. ... We need to have the governor step up, give us the resources that he’s promised from the beginning.'","Democratic Gov. Jay Nixon drew fire from Republican Lt. Gov. Peter Kinder for calling in the guard but then never deploying them into the riot zone .
Nixon fired back Tuesday, calling the accusation 'false and absurd'
Kinder had pointed fingers at Attorney General Eric Holder and the Obama administration, saying they pressured Nixon to show restraint .
'I cannot imagine any other reason why the governor who mobilized the National Guard would not have them in [Ferguson] to stop this'
Guardsmen were deployed to other St. Louis suburbs Monday night but only arrived in Ferguson on Tuesday morning to survey the wreckage .
Nixon dodged a question about whether or not guard troops were on Ferguson's main streets before the chaos erupted ."
"The issue of how best to balance a film's accuracy with its entertainment value has long vexed Hollywood executives. And  it now appears to have ruffled feathers at the British Museum after the latest Ben Stiller film shot on site featured a number of scenes curators are concerned could mislead  visitors. British Museum staff treated to an advanced screening of Night at the Museum 3: The Secret of the Tomb were aghast when a scene showed its characters fleeing from lava during the eruption of Pompeii. Actor Ben Stiller pictured in a scene from the film. Staff from the museum have been forced to clarify that some of the exhibits featured in the movie are not actually held at the museum . The film is about a museum security guard (Ben Stiller, pictured) who goes on adventures inside the museum with a group of exhibits who have come to life . Staff at the British Museum (pictured) have forced to clarify what exhibits the museum does and does not hold after several major liberties were taken by the filmmakers . The audience let out an audible gasp, with one woman screeching: 'There was no lava at Pompeii - Vesuvius erupted with a pyroclastic flow', The Times reported. The ancient Roman town was buried in the deadly explosion not by lava, but ash and pumice. British Museum staff have now provided an information guide to rectify some points the film portrays for the purposes of entertainment, but which have little basis in reality. Sian Toogood, the musesum's broadcast manager, told The Times curators instinctively disliked inaccuracies, but she was hoping the film would draw in new visitors despite a few liberties being taken. She said: 'We don't have a model of Pompeii at all, so it's kind of moot what kind of eruption it has. We're really hoping that it will encourage people who might not normally come to the museum. 'But if they want dinosaurs they should go to the Natural History Museum.' While much of the film does portray real exhibits - albeit ones which come to life - other inaccuracies include an impressive but entirely fictional triceratops skeleton. Filmmakers were obviously building on the popularity of the previous films' tyrannosaurus rex character when they added it into the script. In reality, the British Museum holds no dinosaur skeletons - they are all located at the Natural History Museum. An artists' illustration of the eruption of Pompeii, which buried the city under a layer of ash and pumice - not lava, as depicted in The Night at the Museum 3 . Not planning to adhere to the strict rules of accuracy like that of its subject matter, Night at the Museum 3: Secret of the Tomb has taken a few liberties which may mislead those planning a visit to the British Museum. The museum doesn't hold a triceratops skeleton. In fact, it contains no dinosaur skeletons as complete or impressive as the foreboding monster Ben Stiller's character faces. In the film, two beautifully glazed porcelain ornaments, known as the Kakiemon elephants from 17th Century Japan, are portrayed as the size of real elephants. In reality, they are only 14inches tall. Although the museum boasts an incredible 120 human mummies, it does not hold the Egyptian pharaoh Ahkmenrah's tomb  as scenes from the film would suggest. British Museum directors have also been forced to remind visitors that it does not hold a 'nine-headed demon snake cast in bronze'. The monster was a feature of Chinese mythology but the museum hold such object. Medieval period enthusiasts will be disappointed to hear that the museum holds nothing that could be attributed to Sir Lancelot - who the curators gently remind is a fictional character - after he makes an appearance in the film. Nor does it have a 'medieval gallery' through which Ben Stiller's character is chased by the museum's fictional triceratops.","Latest Night at the Museum film contains numerous historical inaccuracies .
It also features exhibits which are not actually held at the British Museum .
Staff have released a  guide for visitors clarifying what the museum  holds ."
"Ferguson was still smoldering this morning after a night of rage that left large part of the city in flames or ruins. At least two dozen businesses were torched during the night of chaos leaving one entire block looking like a warzone. At the corner of West Florissant Avenue and Chambers street a strip of seven shops had been ransacked or burned down. Prime Beauty on the corner had completely collapsed on itself and fires were still burning inside the building. Scroll down for video . Trail of destruction: Just some of the destruction on West Florissant Avenue today . From above: An aerial view of the destruction shows just what a scale it was on. Burned shops can be seen at the right of the picture, while a police roadblock in the front closes access to the 'crime scene'. Still smoldering: The remains of a series of burned-out shops were still smoking on West Florissant Avenue today . Razed: One of the worst sites of destruction was at the intersection of West Florissant Avenue, Ferguson's main thoroughfare, and Chambers Road, where an entire strip of seven shops was attacked, with Prime Beauty destroyed completely . Aftermath: A firefighter at work at Prime Beauty in the early hours of this morning immediately after it was set ablaze . After - and before: Prime Beauty this morning (left) and as it was as before Ferguson was engulfed in violence . Smashed: The rest of the seven-shop strip on West Florissant and Chambers, which was systematically torn apart . Devastated: The distraught owner of Queen's Royal Touch hair salon arrived at work to find his business destroyed . The roof sagged to the ground in the middle and at the front the wall had given way and fallen in on itself. Eerily the sign 'Prime Beauty' lay intact on the floor at the front of the heap of steaming, smoking rubble. Next door at the Clean World Laundromat the windows had been smashed and the front door had been broken. Inside glass was all over the floor and water covered the floor. The smell of smoke hung in the air and the looters had mindlessly torn off the front of one of the washing machines. The On On Chop Suey Chinese restaurant had also been broken into and the glass front door ripped open but with nothing to steal the rioters had just destroyed it and left. A tax office next to that had been completely cleared out of furniture with just a few chairs left inside. The owner of Queen's Royal Touch beauty salon was too upset to comment. His windows had been smashed and many of the products on the shelves had been stolen. With tears in his eyes, he said: 'There's a time for talking and it isn't now. We just have to rebuild'. Residents stood and wept as they walked out of their homes and made their way across the street to look at the wreckage on their doorstep. Teacher Annie Chalk, 55, said: 'Prime Beauty had been here for about 20 years and I used to go there all the time. 'That Chinese restaurant had the best fries around here. 'The laundromat was always busy. These were good community stores. You had to wait two hours to go to the nail salon it was that popular. 'There was always something going on. Where are people going to go now?' Further down West Florissant Avenue the entire block between Chambers Street and Solway Avenue looked like a scene from an urban nightmare - or a warzone. All the shops that were not boarded up had broken windows. Laughing: Local Kode Palmer poses with a bottle of wine and the cans of beer left in a cart outside the shops which had been looted, to have his picture taken by Chivas Johnson. Both men said they had not been involved in the looting last night . Remains: This looted alcohol (left) was left behind by the mob outside the burned out JC Wireless building (right) The JC Wireless and Beauty Town building on West Florissant Avenue this morning: the entire block was burned out . The Public Storage facility had been badly burned and was still smoking. The McDonald's restaurant - which had sheltered many protesters during the unrest in August - had its windows smashed and glass was all over the tables and chairs. Two shops in the same building - JC Wireless and Beauty Town - were completely gutted by fire and the roof had collapsed, leaving the air conditioning unit laying on top of the remains. White singed bricks were strewn into the street and the back room had become a mass of mangled, charred metal. Flames were still licking the top of the remaining walls and a trolley full of beers stood out the back which looters had been stealing but left behind. Chivas Johnson chuckled as he took a picture of his friend Kode Palmer as he held up a beer from the trolley. Destruction: :A rioter uses a stick to break a window at the Hunan Chop Suey Chinese Restaurant along West Florissant Ave last night . Nothing left: This was all that was left of the Hunan Chop Suey Chinese restaurant this morning after the fire wrecked it . Picture: 'I don't condone this but I can understand it. I have been racially profiled myself,' said Jason Westbrook of Ferguson as he took video of the burning of the Title Max Loans business on West Florissant . As they were: The Hunan Chop Suey and TitleMax loans were both intact before last night's orgy of violence . Burning: Cars parked outside one row of shops on West Florissant were targeted in the destruction spree . Burned out: Cars parked outside one row of shops on West Florissant were targeted in the destruction spree . Inspection: The scale of destruction became clear today after a night which saw fires raised across the St Louis suburb of Ferguson . Attacked: McDonald's on West Florissant was smashed up although not set on fire. It had previously (right) avoided damage . Devastated: A gas station was among the targets of the violence. Today property manager Terri Willits witnessed the destruction . Crime scene: Much of West Florissant was under police guard today and described by officers as an active crime scene . Both men, in their 20s, denied having been out during the riot the night before but said they had been out in August during the protests then. Johnson said that the violence but 'good for the pictures but bad for us'. He accused the police of being 'neo Nazis'. But he also joked about the trolley of beers and said: 'It's like, do you want a beer?' before laughing again. Police refused to let reporters walk along West Florissant Avenue and told them: 'This is still an active crime scene'. Across Ferguson the community struggled to make sense of what had happened. Interviewed on a local TV station a woman called Gayle, said: 'These places have been here for a long time - to tear up where you live, it doesn't make sense'. A caller into a local radio station said: 'There was no peace last night. No peace'. Residents on the streets told MailOnline that the wreckage to Ferguson was so bad that it looked like ‘Ferganistan’. Another said that it ‘looked like Iraq’. Almost every building along South Florissant Street, where the Ferguson police station is located, had been ransacked or vandalised. Tony Koenig and his brother Ray, 38 and 40, had taken the day off from working as school groundskeepers to help rebuild a Mexican restaurant run by a friend. Tony said: ‘I have lived in Ferguson for 38 years and I have never seen anything like this. They just want street justice and they don’t care about how they get it. ‘This young generation. I cannot understand why they do what they do. The parents are to blame. When me and my brother grew up both our parents worked and we were raised knowing how to show respect, and that doesn’t happen these days. ‘We’ve had a hard enough time paying our mortgages after the economy went down. We don’t need this’. Their friend Drew Canaday, who was also helping them, lives in the street next to South Florissant and said that it was ‘like a war’ the night before. More destruction: The arson frenzy also hit South Florissant Street, about a mile away. This branch of Little Casear's was burned out . Ashes: The Little Caesar's was left almost entirely destroyed today after the arsonists struck last night . Distraught: The manager of the Little Caesar's said he understood the protesters were angry but added: 'Speaking your mind - that’s America. You are supposed to be able to protest peacefully and make your point. But this...' Et tu: The neighboring antique shop to the Little Caesar's was also destroyed in the orgy of violence which hit Ferguson . Overwhelmed: The antique shops was well alight before firefighters were able to finally bring it under control . He said: ‘These young people are so used to instant gratification, they want stuff now. They are too immature to understand that stuff takes time. ‘Especially something this big. It takes dialogue and not everyone will be happy but that’s compromise. ‘These people don’t want to wait. That what today’s society has come to, not just here in Ferguson - this is America, this is the world.’ Further up South Florissant a Little Caesar’s pizza restaurant had been burned to the ground, as had the antiques store next to it. The manager of the restaurant, who declined to give his name for fear of reprisals, said that 12 people had now been put out of work and did not know if the owners would rebuild. The manager said that the store was destroyed by a tornado three years earlier and they did build it back but it cost ‘a lot of money’. He said: ‘Most of the people here have families and they are very worried about what will come next for them. ‘I’m proud to work here and started as the dishwasher and worked my way up. I had a motorcycle accident and had my foot amputated and they were good enough to give me a job, . The manger, a widower with two children in their 20s, said that he was in principle on the side of the protesters but that this was ‘too far’. He said: ‘I believe in their right to protest and what they’re doing is a just case. ‘Speaking your mind - that’s America. You are supposed to be able to protest peacefully and make your point. But this...’ So close: While fires burns in Ferguson, the rest of St Louis is also on edge. The center of the city is in the background .","At least two dozen businesses torched and strips of shops razed to the ground or ransacked .

"The two Philadelphia transit officers who delivered a baby boy in a train carriage on Christmas day have gone to visit the mother in hospital and the little boy they brought into the world. SEPTA Police Sgt. Daniel Caban and Officer Darrell James responded to a call around 5.50pm on Thursday and when they climbed on the train, they could already see the baby's head, they said. A group of riders had formed a circle around the mother to give her some privacy as she went into labor on the Market-Frankford Line, the Philadelphia Inquirer reported. The officers, who both have children of their own, donned their gloves and Caban knelt down to catch the baby boy as he was born at the 15th Street station. Scroll down for video . Happy reunion: SEPTA officer Darrell James (left) and police Sgt. Daniel Caban (right) visit Yanjin Li at Hahnemann Hospital on Friday and her son, Chris, who they helped deliver on Christmas . Response: SEPTA Sgt. Daniel Caban rushes aboard the train after reports of a woman's water breaking . Incredible: This is the moment the officers catch the baby during the birth on the train, as passengers rally around Yanjin Li to give her privacy. Some started filming and taking photos . Delivery: Cell phone footage captured the moment the officers checked the baby after he was born . The officers, who both have children of their own, went to visit the mother and baby - who are both healthy - at Hahnemann Hospital on Friday morning. During the visit, the mom, Yanjin Li, told the officers she had decided to call the little boy Chris, considering he was born on Christmas, according to NBC Philadelphia. It was a happy reunion for all involved, considering the last time they had seen each other, the officers were scrambling for a sweater to wrap little Chris in following the impromptu birth. They found a generous passenger, wrapped up the baby, and then put him into his mother's arms for the first time. 'The mother was at peace with the baby,' Caban told the Inquirer. The youngster's umbilical cord was slightly tangled around his neck, but they were able to free him. Apart from that it was a healthy birth. An ambulance took the two to hospital. Surveillance footage taken inside the carriage showed a medic smiling as he held the healthy newborn. 'It was such a joy to see a baby born on a train, you're not expecting that,' passenger Loreta McNeil told ABC6. At the ready: Another surveillance footage image shows the two Philadelphia transit police officers, center and right, as they help deliver the boy at the 15th and Market streets station in Philadelphia . Relief: A medic can be seen carrying the baby boy, who was wrapped in his father's sweater . Healthy: The tot was taken to Hahnemann University Hospital and he and his mother are doing well . The officers said they had been looking forward to a quiet shift before heading home to their families but they were more than happy to help the couple. 'It was the best Christmas gift that I would ever be able to ask for,' said James, who has three kids with another on the way. 'Having a kid born on Christmas but also being able to help a family.' 'I was hoping for a quiet day, but this is worth it,' Caban told CBS. 'This is what our job about.' He added: 'I had already opened all my presents I didn't know I had another one waiting for me around 5:53 this afternoon.' Joy: SEPTA Police Officer Darrell James (left) and Sgt. Daniel Caban (right) delivered the baby boy . SEPTA Police Chief Thomas Nestel III later tweeted his congratulations. 'Transit Police SGT and PO deliver baby on Market Frankford El train!!!! WOOHOO!!! Now that's a Christmas gift!!!' he wrote. In a later tweet, he added: 'For those that have asked, I have waived today's fare for our newest rider.' Many passengers on the train started filming and taking photos of the scene, such as local musician Sunny Ali, who posted a detailed photo of the birth to his Instagram.","WARNING: DETAILED BIRTH PHOTOS .

"A Miami-based businessman and aviation enthusiast has become the first person to fly in a private three-room cabin that has been dubbed the world’s most exclusive – and expensive – airline seat. After months of anticipation and fanfare, Etihad Airways’ Airbus A380 superjumbo jet made its inaugural commercial flight from London Heathrow Airport to Abu Dhabi on Saturday. Gino Bertuccio and a guest were seated comfortably in The Residence, a ‘penthouse in the sky’ that costs £14,000 for a one-way flight for one or two people. Scroll down for video . Passenger Gino Bertuccio accepts a drink from Georgina Henderson, the world's first in-flight butler . The Residence boasts three rooms - a bedroom with a double bed, ensuite shower room and living room . Etihad’s VIP concierge team took care of all of Mr Bertuccio’s needs, including limousine transfers and custom menu planning. He said: ‘There were many firsts on this inaugural flight – new amenities, services and other innovations to try. ‘Flying in The Residence by Etihad was a truly unique adventure, the top of luxury. My only wish was that the flight was longer.’ Mr Bertuccio runs Ligi Import Corp, an Italian cosmetic retailer, and has been passionate about flying since he was a child. He is an avid collector of airline memorabilia with nearly 2,000 model aircraft and albums filled with boarding passes and photos from past flights, and he has travelled on 22 inaugural and final flights in premium class cabins in the last 25 years. Flight EY12 departs London Heathrow Airport with a full complement of nearly 500 passengers . Mr Bertuccio has travelled on 22 inaugural and final flights in premium class cabins in the last 25 years . On this occasion, Flight EY12 departed Heathrow with a full complement of 498 passengers (two in The Residence, nine in first class, 70 in business and 417 in economy) at 9:15am. It was the first time the double-decker aircraft carried paying customers on the seven-hour journey between the UK and United Arab Emirates capitals. Etihad, the national carrier of United Arab Emirates, will operate daily flights on the London-Abu Dhabi route and by August 2015 on all of its three services. In June it will add the A380 to its Abu Dhabi-Sydney route. In addition to a bedroom, The Residence boasts a private ensuite bathroom (pictured) and living room . Located on the A380’s forward upper deck, The Residence is an ultra-luxurious suite that boasts a living room, separate ensuite shower room and bedroom with a double bed. It is the first of its kind and it is the only private cabin to come with a dedicated Savoy-trained butler. On Saturday’s flight Georgina Henderson, from Merseyside, became the world’s first in-flight butler. She has been working for Etihad for four years and was part of a group of 13 employees who were selected to train for three weeks at the Savoy Academy. The Residence is the first of its kind and it is the only private cabin to come with a Savoy-trained butler . The 28-year-old, who has a degree in broadcast journalism, was previously a food and beverage manager on Etihad’s long-haul fleet and once worked at BBC Radio Merseyside in Liverpool. Etihad is using The Residence to try to lure wealthy travellers, especially those who would normally opt for a private jet. The airline says the 125-square-foot penthouse has many of the amenities associated with a private plane at ‘barely a tenth of the cost’ for the same journey. Etihad’s A380 also boasts private first-class compartments with a reclining lounge seat and full-length bed, chilled mini-bar, personal vanity and wardrobe.","Gino Bertuccio is an aviation enthusiast who owns Ligi Import Corp .

"A yellow Labrador that got spooked on a Christmas Day hike in the C snapping her leash and plunging 150 feet down a cliff, was rescued in the dark by a climber who rappelled to a narrow ledge where the dog was trapped. David Schelske of West Linn told the Oregon Humane Society that when thee-year-old Sandy bounded around a bend and disappeared he figured her for a goner. He hiked to the bottom of the cliff and saw her stranded on a narrow ledge 70 feet above. At around 7 pm, an eight-person crew helped Humane Society volunteer John Thoeni descend. He fitted a rescue harness on the frightened dog, and the two were hoisted to safety. Sandy suffered minor injuries but walked out to the trailhead.

"Children as young as 13 are being given lessons in combating cyber terrorism amid concerns over the UK’s vulnerability to attacks similar to the hacking of entertainment giant Sony. Those behind the scheme include experts at the Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ), the top-secret organisation that provides electronic surveillance of the nation’s enemies. The Government is taking the scheme so seriously that next summer’s GCSE computer science exam will contain questions about cyber security for the first time. Children as young as 13 are being given lessons in combating cyber terrorism, backed by experts at the Government Communications Headquarters, GCHQ (pictured) Target: A scene from The Interview, the film at the centre of recent hacking . Experts say there is a dire shortage of specialists able to defend Britain’s computer systems from increasingly sophisticated assaults by hostile states and terrorists. Sony was recently the victim of hackers, who released large numbers of confidential emails in an attempt to stop the release of The Interview, a comedy mocking North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. The fear is that a similar online assault on Britain would dangerously compromise parts of the Government. Security expert Professor Anthony Glees, from Buckingham University, said: ‘The next conflict may not just be about bombs and bullets – it will almost certainly involve massive cyber attacks.’ Under the Government-funded initiative, GCHQ and other organisations including the National Crime Agency (NCA), are creating lesson plans that can be incorporated in computer classes for 14- to 16-year-olds. Those students aged 13 who show a real aptitude for maths will also be taught the skills. GCHQ has created an app for children that explains encryption techniques, and allows children to create their own encoded messages. The Cryptoy app also details the history of codes, including the decrypting of the Nazi Enigma machine that helped to end the Second World War. Gamers around the world were left disappointed on Christmas Day after hacking group Lizard Squad carried through with its threat to bring down both Sony's PlayStation Network and Microsoft's Xbox Live service . As part of the lesson plans being rolled out in schools, the NCA has produced case studies on the risks in a number of technically complex areas. Another plan designed by telecoms giant BT teaches children the basics of computer firewalls, while a third warns of the dangers of computer viruses such as ‘trojans’ and ‘worms’. Nearly 800 schools have signed up for the new package, from the exclusive Cheltenham Ladies’ College to top state school King Edward VI grammar in Chelmsford, Essex. One exam board has already provided a sample question for next summer’s computer science GCSEs. It asks pupils to design a system to prevent a thief who steals their mobile phone from using credits on it to take free rides on a bus. GCHQ has also set up several university degree courses to train students in computer security. Chris Ensor, of GCHQ, said: ‘It is vital that we tap into, enthuse and encourage the flourishing talent in our schools. We need gifted teenagers like these coming into the cyber security profession.’ For more information about the Cyber Security Challenge UK, click here.","Children as young as 13 given lessons in combating cyber terrorism .

"Meet Britain's biggest bull who tips the scales at almost two tonnes in weight, the same size as an adult hippopotamus. Barnsford Ferny is double the weight of most other bulls and has enough meat on him to make 45,000 Big Macs. Standing at an impressive 7ft in height, the bulky bovine, who is used for stud, has sired 150 calves in the last year. Scroll down for video . Holy cow: Barnsford Ferny pictured with his owner Charlie Boden, has been named Britain's biggest bovine after tipping the scales at nearly two tonnes . Farmer Charlie Boden, from Stockport, Greater Manchester, insists that despite his prize beasts hefty build, the four-year-old is a big softie. 'Barnsford's got 50 calves on our farm and then people have come all over the country to breed from him,' said the farmer, 51. 'He has sired at least another 100 calves just through artificial insemination in he last twelve months alone. 'We only start breeding our bulls when they reach three years old, so it's taken just over a year for him to have that many children. 'Because he's such a massive specimen, coupled with the fact he's a record breaker, people come from far and wide to get some of his genes. 'People are always amazed when they see him - no other farmer that's met him knows of a bigger bull.' In the last year Barnsford, pictured with his owner Charlie Boden, has fathered 150 calves . Barnsford cost Mr Boden around £3,500 in 2011, a then record fee for a Charolais breed. Then in 2013 the huge white bull won two awards at the Royal Welsh, including the individual supreme award in the interbreed beef awards. He lives alongside 20 other bulls, but despite living off the same diet, Barnsford absolutely dwarves them. 'He doesn't get anything special to eat,' said Mr Boden. 'He's got all the grass he can eat in the fields and about 10-15lb of concentrate per day which is the same as the other bulls. 'He's always been a big lad, and he's just getting bigger - he's a monster. 'Barnsford's a real ladies man. 'As long as he's got his cows around him he's chuffed. 'Having said that though, you get him round any of the other bulls and he puffs out his chest and asserts his macho dominance. Charolais cattle originate from France and normally weigh between 900 and 1100kg.","Bulky bull Barnsford Ferny weighs almost two tonnes and stands at 7ft tall .

Strange circumstance: Johnson was found dead inside a rolled-up gym mat (above) in January of 2013 . CNN reports that the student, who has not been named, confronted Johnson and told him 'it ain't over' after an incident between Johnson and the younger brother of the former student. While he was said to have been at a wrestling match at another school at the time of Johnson's death, lawyers are now saying the bus had not left yet at the time of Johnson's death. An attorney for the sheriff's office confirmed the recent interviews and released a statement saying; 'The Lowndes County Sheriff's Office initiated the interviews of the Lowndes High School wrestling team coach, the bus driver and wrestling team members in response to claims made known to the sheriff's office that the wrestling team was still on the school's campus when Kendrick Johnson was last known to have been alive.' He then added; 'The information gathered thus far indicates that the bus carrying the wrestling team had left the school's campus prior to the time that Kendrick Johnson was last known to have been alive.' Students have reported seeing the questioned teen on the bus at the time making the time of departure the crucial element in the investigation. Authorities had initially said that Johnson died while trying to retrieve a sneaker from inside the mat . Johnson was found a day after being reported missing in his high school gym . Accounts on when exactly the bus left are remarkably varied, with some saying 10am, some saying noon, the bus driver saying 12:30pm and the actual request put into the school by the coach saying 4pm. Johnson is believed to have died around 1:30pm of positional asphyxia, a death authorities said they believed happened when he crawled inside the gym mat to retrieve a sneaker. The parents of the 17-year-old hired a forensic pathologist to look into the case believing that the story was cover up, who stated that he found evidence of 'unexplained, apparent nonaccidental blunt force trauma' to the neck. The former student in question, who is not a suspect and has been charged with no crime, and his younger brother who had been in a fight with Johnson were both advised not to speak to investigators by their attorney.","Investigators are still looking into the mysterious death of a teenager who died two years ago .

"The family of one-punch victim Daniel Christie, who died after being hit to the head, have spoken out against the relaxed drinking laws for this year's New Years Eve. Daniel Christie, 18, was allegedly knocked unconscious with a single blow to the head by martial arts fighter Shaun McNeil in Sydney's Kings Cross on New Year's Eve last year. 'I am disappointed that in spite of all these good things that have happened, the government is now saying, 'because it's improved, relax it',' said Daniel's father, Michael Christie. The family of one-punch victim Daniel Christie (above) have slammed the relaxed laws for New Years . 'Because we aren't all getting killed on the roads are we going to up the speed limit? It just doesn't make common sense,' he told The Sun Herald. The teenager died after 11 days on life support, contributing towards the introduction of stricter lockout laws in NSW, preventing entry to venues after 1.30am and no alcohol served after 3am. On New Year's Eve the laws will be relaxed in Sydney's CBD to 3am, a ruling which Mr Christie says sends the wrong message. Despite Mr Christie's concerns, Deputy Premier Troy Grant said that the relaxed drinking rules had the support of the family of teenager Thomas Kelly, who died in 2012 from a punch to the head. 'I am disappointed that in spite of all these good things that have happened, the government is now saying, 'because it's improved, relax it',' said Daniel's father, Michael Christie (second from right) The teenager died after 11 days on life support, contributing towards the introduction of stricter lockout laws in NSW, preventing entry to venues after 1.30am and no alcohol served after 3am . Daniel Christie, 18, was allegedly knocked unconscious with a single blow to the head by martial arts fighter Shaun McNeil (above) in Sydney's Kings Cross on New Year's Eve last year . Mr Grant said that safety was the priority of the NSW Police, and the City of Sydney, who also backed the decision. 'We recognise people want to celebrate the start of the new year but we also want to maintain there will be no change to the last drinks at 3am or the tough measures we have implemented to protect the community,' said Mr Grant. The laws have been introduced to reduce street congestion and public transport pressure following the fireworks display at midnight, but only apply for the night. People will be able to enter venues until 3am, though the no-take-away law still applies after 10pm. Former premier Barry O'Farrell said the new laws, which included a curfew on trading hours to 3am across the city, sent out 'the possible strongest message' that drug and alcohol-fuelled violence will no longer be tolerated. The laws have been introduced to reduce street congestion and public transport pressure following the fireworks display at midnight, but only apply for the night . On New Year's Eve the laws will be relaxed in Sydney's CBD to 3am, a ruling which Mr Christie says sends the wrong message . Mr Christie's death was one of several attacks that sparked new laws introduced to help curb alcohol-fueled attacks . Under the new laws anyone convicted of reckless grievous bodily harm or wounding a member of the public or a police officer while intoxicated can expect a minimum sentence of three to five years and a maximum penalty of up to 16 years. There has been a drop in alcohol-related assaults in licensed venues by 40% since the introduction of the laws, reported The Sun Herald. Mr Christie said that the objections to the ruling did not come from a place of bitterness, and that the family did not 'hate' Ms McNeil for allegedly causing the death of Daniel. Around the CBD there will also be heightened security following the spate of terror threats, with counter-terrorism agents working around the city. Assistant Police Commissioner Michael Fuller said it was not uncommon for authorities to be involved in New Year's Eve celebrations.","Daniel Christie, 18, died after being punched in the head by MMA fighter Shaun McNeil, 26, on New Years Eve last year .

"A Mauritania court has condemned a man to be shot to death for insulting the Islamic prophet of Mohammad, a human rights group claims. Mohamed Cheikh Ould Mkhaitir, 28, was arrested a year ago for writing an article about the Prophet Mohammad and the caste system, an extremely sensitive subject in a country with deep social and racial divisions. It comes as the country's president Mohamed Ould Abdel Aziz continues to deny the practice of slavery still exists, despite widespread evidence of it and other human rights abuses occurring within the West African nation. Mauritania president Mohamed Ould Abdel Aziz (pictured) has continued to deny there are human rights abuses prevalent within his country . The prosecution asked for the death penalty to be carried out in accordance with Islamic sharia law and recommended he be shot. He claims his article has been misinterpreted and was reported to have fainted in court when the verdict was handed down. Mauritania, a poor country straddling Arab and black Africa, last applied the death penalty in 1987. Separately, a court in the southern town of Rosso began proceedings on Wednesday against anti-slavery campaigner Biram Ould Dah Ould Abeiday and six members of his organisation for 'inciting violence, disrupting public order, contempt for authorities and membership of a non-recognised organisation'. Mauritania became the last country worldwide to legally abolish slavery in 1981 and still has the highest prevalence worldwide of slavery per head of population, according to the Global Slavery Index 2013. Perceived slights against the Prophet have a history of causing offence among Muslim populations, and can carry with them harsh and brutal punishments. British writer Salman Rushdie's 1988 book The Satanic Verses caused such anger among some Muslim populations a fatwa calling for his death was issued by Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. The award-winning author, pictured with the book, was forced into hiding after Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini vowed to kill him, anyone involved in the book's publication, and anyone close to him . The outrage and widespread chaos over the book has lasted 25 years. Here Pakistani Muslims are pictured protesting against Salman Rushdie and Britain in 2007. Five years later, the bounty was raised . It led to several failed attempts to assassinate Rushdie and forced the award-winning writer into hiding. Hitoshi Igarashi, the Japanese translator, was stabbed to death in the face at work, a Norwegian publisher shot and an Italian publisher knifed. In late 2005 and early 2006, protests were across the globe in outrage over a series of cartoons in a Danish newspaper depicting the Prophet. Several Western embassies were attacked and people killed in demonstrations which turned violent, while plots to attack or even kill editor Flemming Rose and cartoonist Kurt Westergaard were subsequently unearthed.","Mohamed Cheikh Ould Mkhaitir was arrested last year for his writing .

"The UK has overtaken France to become the fifth largest economy in the world after the money made from prostitution and drugs was counted in the GDP figure for the first time. Britain's economy is expected to be worth a total £1.86trillion in 2014 - up from £1.63trillion the previous year - compared to £1.82trillion in France, new calculations reveal. Government figures show that prostitution added about £4.3billion to the economy while illegal drugs provided a roughly £6.7billion boost. Boost: The darker corners of the economy are now being counted - alongside traditional sectors such as farming and financial services - as part of an overhaul in the way economic activity is measured . This year is the first time that the GDP - an economic estimate produced every three months by the Office For National Statistics (ONS) - has included the money made from illegal drugs and sex work. The darker corners of the economy are now being measured - alongside traditional sectors such as farming and financial services - as part of an overhaul in the way  economic activity is calculated. The change, which was introduced as part of EU rules implemented earlier this year, means that a booming sex trade or an expansion in the market for illegal drugs can boost the Chancellor's outlook. And when these more inclusive figures edged the nation ahead of France in world rankings when they were used in calculations of the size of the UK's economy. Source: Centre for Economics and Business Research . But experts at the Centre for Economics and Business Research, who produced the World Economic League Table, noted that France did not include the sex work and illegal drugs in its estimations. It added that, if it did, there was a possibility that it might retake its fifth place position - and that the UK might drop down to sixth. France does not include prostitution and illegal drugs in calculations as it does not believe they constitute 'voluntary commercial activity', adding that they are often tied to criminal networks. The GDP covers every sector - from manufacturing and construction to agriculture, public services and tourism. It now also covers the import, production and sale of illegal drugs and the ‘provision of prostitution services’. The data classes growing drugs or importing them as ‘production’, buying them for home use as ‘expenditure’ and selling them as ‘income’. It covers crack cocaine, powder cocaine, heroin, cannabis, ecstasy and amphetamines. While some EU countries give a detailed breakdown of prostitution types such as ‘street’ and ‘escorts’, the UK is not able to do this with the data available. Overhaul: The change, which was introduced as part of EU rules implemented earlier this year, means that a booming sex trade or an expansion in the market for illegal drugs can boost the Chancellor's outlook . Illegal drugs and sex work were worth £12.3bn, or 0.7 per cent of our GDP, making them as economically significant as agriculture,  according to ONS figures released this year. The CEBR expects Britain to pull further ahead of France in the coming years. The data also showed that China is expected to overtake the US as the world's largest economy in 2025. Meanwhile, the figures also showed the impact of the economic crisis in Russia, which slipped two places in the 2014 league table to tenth, back below India and Italy.","Britain's economy is expected to be worth total £1.86trillion in 2014 .

"'Christmas thief': Sean Ashelman, 24, allegedly stole the toy on December 19 to make $30 . A babysitter allegedly stole a two-year-old's Christmas toy from under the tree then took it back to the store so he could pocket a $30 refund. Police say Sean Ashelman, 24, stole a Mickey Mouse-themed table and chair set meant for young Conner Parsons while he was looking after him. He is accused of sneaking upstairs while Conner's mother was away, finding the receipt for the gift, then returning it to a Family Dollar store near their home in Watsontown, Pennsylvania. According to local news channel WNEP-16, Ashelman has been charged with theft, and also forgery after giving a fake signature for the refund. The man, a former family friend, is now jailed in Snyder County jail on a $25,000 bail after being arrested over the December 19 theft. Ashelman, who gave no fixed address, was reportedly living with friends when tracked down by police, and had left fake contact information elsewhere. The Family Dollar store donated a new table so Conner could still have his Christmas present. A preliminary hearing is scheduled for December 31.

"These are the first photos of three boys died along with their grandmother in a house fire after spending the night with her so wouldn't be alone on Christmas. Terry Harris, 60, died alongside her grandsons, Kenyon, 14, Broderick, 11 and Braylon, 9. The grandmother was thought to be trying to rush her three grandchildren out of her front door in Fayette County, Ohio, when they succumbed to the devastating fire which destroyed the house and left their bodies badly burned. These are the first photos of three boys died along with their grandmother in a house fire after spending the night with her so wouldn't be alone on Christmas. Pictured: Broderick, 11 (left) and Braylon (right), aged 9 . Pictured: Kenyon, 14. The boys lived just two houses away but wanted to stay overnight to keep their grandmother company . The boys lived just two houses away but wanted to stay overnight to keep their grandmother company. The deadly blaze was reported at around 4am on December 26. By the time the fire was extinguished, most of the single-story, ranch-style home had been destroyed. Fayette County coroner Dr. Dennis Mesker said the badly burned bodies were turned over to the Montgomery County coroner's office for autopsies and confirmation. 'They didn't want their grandma to be by herself on Christmas night; that's why they spent the night there,' Fayette County Sheriff Vernon Stanforth said. 'The children just adored their grandmother.' State Fire Marshal's spokesman William Krugh said state investigators are still trying to determine what caused the blaze. Stanforth said the grandmother's body was found near the front door, with the children near, so authorities think she was trying to help them get out. Firefighters sifting through the smoldering debris found the bodies hours after the blaze erupted because the site was too unstable and hot before then. Wreckage and death: The four badly burned bodies were pulled from the wreckage of this house in Fayette County, Ohio, on the morning of December 26. The boys stayed with their grandmother overnight so she wouldn't be alone on Christmas . Early blaze: The fire was reported to rescuers at 4am.

'To lose three children and a grandparent, it's devastating to the family,' Stanforth said by telephone from the Washington Court House area some 40 miles southwest of Columbus. 'The fact that it's the holidays makes it even worse for the community.' He said that he had known the family for years and that the oldest boy had wrestled competitively. 'They're a very close-knit family,' he said. 'They were good boys.'

"It turns out spiders are just as scared of us as we are of them. This video shows a small spider which has built a web in a sink recoiling or twitching every time a man makes a loud noise to frighten it. The startled spider curls up in a ball and spasms while the man apparently does his best impression of a shrieking Homer Simpson.

According to the study, led by Clemens F Schaber of the University of Vienna’s department of neurobiology, spiders have more than 3,000 sensors in their body. Most are found on the legs and in vibration receptors near the leg joints.","Small spider, discovered by man with a camera, built a web in a sink .

"For the adventure seekers among us, going on specialised tours can really make it a holiday to remember. But some experiences around the world are more extreme than others, even putting holidaymakers at risk of arrest. From Bolivia's so-called Death Road - a mountain-side route that tourists tackle on bikes - to the experience of being 'arrested' by Soviet secret police in Lithuania, here are some of the most extreme tours that holidaymakers pay for around the world. Memories of the horrific nuclear blast remain for tourists to see on the Fukushima tour . Contamination levels are now low enough for coach tours to visit the Fukushima power plant . The Fukushima Nuclear Reactor Tour - Japan . The Fukushima site, the scene of the worst nuclear disaster since Chernobyl, has become a tourist attraction. Local government tour guides are now escorting buses of people through the area, explaining what has become of the disaster zone. Back in 2011, three of the Fukushima Nuclear Plant's six reactors blew up following a tsunami, releasing radioactive gases that meant the whole area had to be evacuated. However, with contamination levels said to be 'low', people are being permitted on whistle-stop tours to view the desolate and abandoned place. Tourists who visit Lithuania get the chance to experience the terrors of a Soviet bunker . Holidaymakers must sign a waiver before agreeing to sign up for the Soviet Bunker Tour . The Soviet Bunker Experience - Lithuania . Lithuania offers a chance for holidaymakers to experience what life was like under the control of the USSR - using real dogs and former KGB officers, and taking place in a former Soviet bunker. The terrifying experience starts with visitors being 'ambushed' by the Red Army in the middle of the forest, 15 miles from the capital Vilnius, before being transported down into the bunker for a three-hour Soviet experience. Before taking part in the experience, which is called 1984: The Survival Drama, holidaymakers are asked to sign a waiver, which includes a clause stating: 'In case of disobedience participants may receive psychological or physical punishments.' Mexicans are led to the border with the US all for show in the Illegal Border Crossing Experience . The Illegal Border Crossing Experience - Mexico . A small town in Mexico has set up a quasi-theme park that offers visitors the chance to experience what Mexican immigrants go through when they illegally cross the U.S. border. For approximately $20 (£13), tourists visiting El Alberto can spend their Saturday night getting a three-hour simulated experience of what it is like to be a migrant attempting to cross the border. Participants in the Caminata Nocturna, which translates as 'night walk', go on a challenging trek where they must evade 'immigration officials' and 'border patrol agents' as they flee through rough terrain. Of course, unlike the millions of migrants who illegally cross into the U.S, the tourists’ lives are in no real danger. A worst case scenario here would be a nasty fall. Make Your Own Cocaine Tour - Colombia . The South American country has cocaine 'factory' tours high up in the mountains of the Sierra Nevada. Holidaymakers willing to take extreme risks can work with local guides to visit poverty-stricken farmers who gamble with their lives in a desperate bid to provide for their families. Tours of the illegal farms can cost as little as $9 (£6), but tourists put themselves at risk from paramilitaries operating in the area - who have been known to kidnap foreigners and hold them years at a time - or arrest by local police. Both experiences are highly illegal and even seeking them out can put foreign travellers at risk of arrest or attack by drug traffickers or paramilitaries. Those who take part in the underground tours can be arrested even if they are just caught on the property of the drug-makers. Many people like taking on a bungee jump, but would you fancy doing one over a crocodile-infested river? Bungee Jumping Over Crocodile-infested Waters - Zambia/Zimbabwe border . Tourists can leap head first from the Victoria Bridge over the crocodile-infested Zambezi River. However, back in 2012, then 22-year-old Australian Erin Langworth took on the bungee challenge, with almost fatal consequences. After flying off the bridge, her rope snapped and she plunged into the water, feet still bound. Her rope got caught on rocks, but that was the least of her trouble with crocodiles swarming. Miraculously, she managed to untangle the rope, and swim to safety with just cuts, bruises and a broken collarbone. Tourists get the chance to explore the Bolivian mines of Potosi, with dynamite strapped to their backs . Mining With Dynamite - Bolivia . In the Silver Mines of Potosi, Bolivia, you can crawl around in the gravel with dynamite strapped to your back. Not only that, but you are handed 95 per cent proof alcohol to give you the Dutch courage to continue on your quest. But once you've polished off the tipple, be prepared to put your mask on, as the dynamite show begins - the walls of the mines shake and disintegrate around you. Not one for the faint-hearted. Silver Lining Tours allow visitors to get up close and personal to Tornados in America's Midwest . Tornado Tours - America's Midwest . Silver Lining Tours will take guests to within a quarter of a mile of some of the swirling 300mph vertical wind funnels. Storm-chasers Roger and Caryn Hill are now taking British punters on the hunt of their lives following deadly and destructive tornados. Ploughing their way through 'Tornado Alley', the couple drive groups of up to 18 people in three buses and charge up to £230 a day for a ten-day chase. At 15,400ft, The Death Road in Bolivia is a favourite spot for thrill-seeking cyclists . The Death Road Tour - Bolivia . At 15,400f, Bolivia's North Yungus Road - better known as 'The Death Road' - is among the nation's biggest draw cards for thrill-seeking tourists, even though it is estimated that 300 people die here every year. Dubbed 'El Camino de la Muerte' (The Death Road) by locals, for obvious reasons, and considered by many the most dangerous stretch of road in the world, the 40-mile journey from its summit entices in excess of 25,000 mountain bike riders annually. The ride takes in the stunning views among the rolling hills of the Amazon rainforest, but come with the somewhat distracting - and for some terrifying -sheer drop into the canopy as two rubber tyres separate the rider from a narrow single-lane road with very little in the way of railings. For the locals, the 'Death Road' is an important transport route which they brave in cars and trucks, teetering on the edge and risking their lives with every trip. For companies such as Gravity Bolivia, a cycling tour company that offers riders the opportunity to experience the once in a lifetime journey through clouds and waterfalls, it's big business.","Japan offers tourists a tour of the obliterated Fukushima power plant .

"It has the glitz of a state-of-the-art superyacht for the ultra-rich but this £50m ferry will soon be transporting passengers between mainland England and the Channel Islands. Condor Ferries welcomed its newest boat on Boxing Day after the high-speed vessel sailed more than 10,000 nautical miles over 22 days on its maiden voyage from Cebu, Philippines to its base in Poole, Dorset. The Austal-built Condor 102 ferry is scheduled to officially enter service in March, when it will transport customers between Poole Harbour to the islands of Guernsey and Jersey. Scroll down for video . It took three weeks days for Condor 102 to complete its maiden voyage from Cebu, Philippines to Poole, Dorset, where it is based . When it enters service in late March the 335-ft vessel will operate between Poole and the islands of Guernsey and Jersey . At 335ft in length, it is the first high-speed trimaran (three-hulled vessel) to operate in Northern Europe and will eventually be given an official name. The ferry has three seat classes, an increased capacity of nearly 900 passengers and 245 cars, and a service speed of 35 knots (approximately 40mph), although its passage time will remain unchanged. But Condor expects this ferry to sail in considerably higher seas, meaning fewer cancellations are expected. The Guernsey-based company said 90 per cent of all weather-related cancellations in 2013 would have been avoided with the Condor 102. With an increased capacity of nearly 900 passengers it is the first high-speed trimaran to operate in Northern Europe, says Condor . Condor expects its state-of-the-art ferry to sail in considerably higher seas, meaning fewer cancellations are anticipated once service begins . During its maiden voyage the ferry sailed across the Indian Ocean and along the Gulf of Aden and Red Sea. From there it sailed through the Suez Canal, crossed the Mediterranean Sea and travelled up the Atlantic Ocean into UK waters. Along the way its crew polished off 1,200 rounds of toast, 1,800 mugs of tea, 150 pints of milk, 300 pots of instant noodles and 150 tins of baked beans, in addition to 250 cartons of orange juice and 120 packs of chocolate biscuits, said Condor Ferries. The ferry can hold nearly 250 cars as it travels at a top service speed of 35 knots (approximately 40mph) in the English Channel . Condor 102 will now undergo a period of customisation and sea trials before it goes into service in time for spring . Captain Fran Collins, executive director at Condor Ferries, told the Dorset Echo: ‘It was exciting to see her sail into the port - the crew were in great spirits. ‘They have done a fantastic job of bringing her home on schedule - everyone at Condor is very thankful for all their hard work and commitment over the last 24 days, and we hope they get home to their families soon to enjoy the rest of the festive period and to see in the New Year.’ Now that it has finally arrived at its home port the Condor 102 will undergo a period of customisation in Poole, with a full internal fit out completed by Trimline. A series of sea trials will take place in the English Channel before the three-engine vessel enters service in late March. Of its current fleet, Condor’s most recent addition before the 102 was the MV Commodore Clipper, which entered service in 1999 and currently sails between Portsmouth and the Channel Islands.","It took three weeks for the 335-ft vessel to sail from Cebu, Philippines to Poole, Dorset, where it is based .
Condor 102 will be given an official name before it enters service in late March .
The state-of-the-art ferry will transport passengers between Poole and the islands of Guernsey and Jersey .
It has a capacity of nearly 900 passengers, 245 cars and a top service speed of 35 knots .
Condor says fewer cancellations are expected as the vessel can sail in higher seas ."
"A mom who 'burned from the inside out' following an allergic reaction to her friend's medication has finally been reunited with her baby after spending a month apart as she battled to survive. Yaasmeen Castanada, 19, suffered a life-threatening allergic reaction called Stevens-Johnson Syndrome after taking antibiotics on Thanksgiving Day because she was feeling sick. Less than 24 hours later, she was hospitalized and on a ventilator with her body breaking out in massive blisters as if she had been burned from head to toe.

"Of all the rumours that dogged Princess Diana’s life, it was surely the one that hurt her the most: that James Hewitt – not Prince Charles – was the father of her second child. Now that painful insinuation has been reignited after Hewitt gave his backing to a controversial new West End play suggesting that he could indeed be Prince Harry’s father. The Mail on Sunday can reveal the former cavalry officer has allowed himself to be portrayed in the production Truth, Lies, Diana, which contains explosive revelations about his relationship with the Princess. Fond looks: James Hewitt and Diana (left) watch Prince Harry (far right) during a visit to an Army base in 1989 . The author of the play, which makes its debut at London’s Charing Cross Theatre on January 9, says it is based on extensive interviews with figures who knew Diana ‘in their own words’, including Hewitt and Paul Burrell, her former butler. In one sensational scene Hewitt tells a journalist: ‘Diana and I started our relationship more than a year before Harry was born. Now that doesn’t prove that I am his father. It’s just the... inconvenient truth.’ Hewitt, 56, last night confirmed that he knows author Jon Conway and spoke to him about his relationship with Diana, and said he had no doubt the play would be ‘accurate’. He said he had not seen the play or read specific scenes even though Conway claimed he had sent him 15 pages of the script for his approval. Conway said: ‘I have been talking to James over a period of two years. I met him and he told me some quite remarkable things that have never been said in the public domain, particularly about when his relationship with Diana started. ‘There is a startling revelation that James Hewitt makes and he has allowed me to make it in the play. This is the fact that his relationship with Diana started 18 months before Prince Harry was born.’ He added: ‘We are not saying he is Prince Harry’s father although the audience may take their own view on that. Hewitt gave his backing to the West End play - which suggests he could indeed be Harry’s father . ‘I don’t know if James Hewitt is Prince Harry’s father and James Hewitt has always denied it either because it isn’t true or out of some sense of loyalty.’ The play, about a journalist trying to find out the truth about Diana’s death in 1997, does not feature a depiction of the Princess herself, but it does include claims about her life, including the unfounded suggestion she was pregnant with Dodi Fayed’s baby when she died. But it is the references to Prince Harry’s paternity which are likely to be the most shocking. In the play, the character of Hewitt insists that he has always denied being Prince Harry’s father, but the play still includes several references to the issue. When the journalist, who is played by Conway, asks Hewitt if he knows who Prince Harry’s father is, he pauses before answering: ‘Of course I do.’ The subject is touched upon again when Hewitt discusses his decision to pursue a military career like his father. He is asked if he would like his own son to follow family tradition before two pictures of him and Harry in near identical military uniform appear on screen. Royal commentators last night branded the play as ‘a nonsense’. But Conway, previously a producer who wrote the successful 2010 musical All The Fun Of The Fair which starred David Essex, said all the revelations in the play were either taken from official documents or were based on interviews with key figures from Diana’s life. Conway said he had shown Hewitt the scenes in advance and that the former officer had approved them. Rumours about Prince Harry’s paternity first began to circulate in 1994 when revelations about his mother’s affair with Hewitt became public. For more than a decade Hewitt denied the claims and insisted that his affair with Diana did not start until 1986 when the Prince was already two years old. Princess Diana pictured with Harry. The rumour that Hewitt is Prince Harry's father - and not Prince Charles - dogged Diana's life . But in 2005 the disgraced publicist Max Clifford claimed in a biography that Hewitt had confided to him that the relationship predated Prince Harry’s birth. Royal commentators last night rubbished the new claims and insisted there was no way Hewitt was the Prince’s father. Penny Junor, who has just published an acclaimed biography of Prince Harry, said: ‘I have spoken to people around at the time and they all say that James Hewitt wasn’t in the picture before 1986. Diana didn’t hide Hewitt when the relationship began. She kept him in plain sight.’ Respected Royal author Margaret Holder said the claims in the play were a ‘nonsense’ and that Hewitt was simply trying to raise his profile. She said: ‘I think this will put him back in the spotlight and it tells producers of reality TV programmes, “Hello, I’m here.” It’s a nonsense but it’s all a game.’ Biographer Hugo Vickers said the play’s claims were not surprising given the people who had been interviewed by Conway. He said: ‘If you talk to certain people you will get a version of events these people are keen to peddle. They have an agenda of their own.’ The controversial play is to be staged at Charing Cross Theatre in London. It makes its debut on January 9 . Hewitt last night confirmed he knew Conway but he declined to be drawn on the play’s contents. He said: ‘I do know Jon. I am aware that he has done a play and I am sure that it is accurate. I obviously have not seen it yet.’ When pushed on the specific line in the play about the timing of his affair with Diana, he said: ‘That is not my quote.’ He also insisted that he had not seen the script for the play. He said: ‘I have not seen the script. Neither have I seen the play. It would be foolish to comment on it before doing so.’ Hewitt last night refused to say when his relationship with Diana began and declined to be drawn on the issue of Prince Harry’s parentage. He said: ‘I wish this subject would go away. It’s never going to and that’s just the way of life.’ A spokesman for Clarence House last night declined to comment.","Rumour that James Hewitt was Prince Harry's father dogged Diana's life .

"A growing rift between Ed Miliband and his Election chief has sparked new fears that the Labour campaign is in crisis. Labour insiders say relations between Mr Miliband and chief strategist Douglas Alexander are so bad, they are barely on speaking terms. Miliband's allies have accused Mr Alexander of 'sulking' after Miliband put Lucy Powell in charge of day-to-day campaigning in the Election. Alexander's friends have hit back, claiming he is 'frustrated' by Miliband's 'inability to act decisively'. Labour insiders say relations between Mr Miliband and chief strategist Douglas Alexander (pictured right) are so bad, they are barely on speaking terms . With just over five months to go before the General Election on May 7, Shadow Cabinet Ministers fear the fallout could rob them of victory. A well-placed source said: 'The tension is palpable when Miliband and Alexander are together. Alexander talks down to Ed and Ed bristles at it. 'Alexander doesn't think Ed pays enough attention to his ideas. It is madness when the polls suggest that the next Election will be such a close- run thing.' The source added: 'They need to put egos and past squabbles to one side and work together for the sake of the party.' When Miliband gave the Election post to Alexander it was seen as a way of healing the rift caused by Alexander's role in running David Miliband's failed bid to beat his brother to the Labour leadership in 2010. But party sources say that, if anything, relations between the two men are even worse now. Although Alexander and Ed Miliband worked closely together for Gordon Brown, Alexander is seen as a 'Blairite' compared to Left-winger Miliband. Alexander, Mr Brown's former speech writer, held several Cabinet positions in the Blair and Brown governments. More recently, he came under fire for Labour's lacklustre campaign during the Scottish referendum – which was rescued by Brown's 11th-hour intervention. Alexander's General Election plan has also been challenged by Labour MPs. Some say his '35 per cent' strategy, whereby Labour sets out to win its 'core vote' but does not woo Middle England, is 'too defensive.' Similarly, his claim that Labour has little to fear from Ukip has been challenged by new evidence that Nigel Farage is eating into the party's support. With just over five months to go before the General Election on May 7, Shadow Cabinet Ministers fear the fallout between the pair could rob them of victory . Mr Alexander, seated next to Ed Miliband, during a meeting in the West Wing of the White House in June 2014 . Miliband's decision last month to put Ms Powell in charge of day-to-day campaigning, with Alexander still in overall control, was seen as an attempt to sideline Alexander. But Powell herself has been accused of 'naïve' gaffes, including advising Labour MPs not to discuss immigration on the doorstep with voters. It is not the first time Alexander has been involved in rows with senior Labour figures. The Mail on Sunday revealed in January how he and Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls had to be 'dragged apart' when they almost came to blows during a blazing row. Former Cabinet Minister Tessa Jowell was forced to intervene, saying she feared the pair were about to get into 'fisticuffs' when they clashed in a private Commons room. In March, this newspaper revealed how another of Miliband's Election aides, Michael Dugher, told the Labour leader he wanted to resign, saying he could no longer work with 'bloody impossible' Alexander. Mr Dugher was moved to the transport portfolio, avoiding further clashes with Alexander. And in April, Deputy Labour Leader Harriet Harman and Mr Balls were caught plotting against Alexander outside Balls's Commons office. Ms Harman told Balls: 'The trouble with Douglas is that he just isn't engaged at the moment.' The Shadow Chancellor reportedly nodded in reply.","Insiders say Ed Miliband and Douglas Alexander are barely speaking .

"Nigel Farage was at the centre of controversy last night after Ukip’s second most powerful politician said the party must stop making racist remarks about immigrants. Douglas Carswell, Ukip’s first elected MP said: ‘Dislike of foreigners is not merely offensive, but absurd.’ The party must be ‘inclusive’ and have no truck with candidates who insult people’s ‘heritage or background’, he says in an article in today’s Mail on Sunday. Scroll down for video . Douglas Carswell, Ukip's first elected MP, with the party's leader Nigel Farage campaigning for the Clacton-on-Sea by election . His comments come after a series of Ukip race rows which have been blamed by some for a drop in the party’s popularity. Clacton MP Mr Carswell is the first senior Ukip politician to admit, in effect, that some of the party’s members are racist. His comments will be seen by some as criticism of Mr Farage, who defended Ukip parliamentary candidate Kerry Smith after he was sacked earlier this month for referring to a ‘Chinky bird’ and ‘pooftahs’ in abusive and obscene phone calls. Mr Farage said he felt sorry for ‘rough diamond’ Mr Smith. The Ukip leader also blamed immigration for causing traffic jams on the M4. Friends of the MP last night stressed he had no criticism of Mr Farage and that he ‘wholeheartedly supports’ the party leader. But the difference in tone between rabble-rouser Mr Farage and intellectual Mr Carswell, who spent his childhood in Africa, will not go unnoticed. Mr Carswell says: ‘No Ukip candidate should ever make the mistake of blaming outsiders for the failings of political insiders in Westminster. Friends of the MP last night stressed he had no criticism of Mr Farage and that he ‘wholeheartedly supports’ the party leader . ‘Far from being a party that tolerates pejorative comments about people’s heritage and background, Ukip has to show that we have serious internationalist agenda.’ It must offer a ‘cheery, welcoming Yes to doctors from Singapore or scientists from south Asia’ while rejecting foreign criminals and benefit scroungers. But Mr Carswell warns: ‘Angry nativism must have no part in it.’ Ukip has made great strides, but must change its attitude to break through in the General Election, he says, adding: ‘We have to show the whole country that we have what it takes to win big. That means an optimistic and inclusive agenda.’ It's not only offensive to dislike foreigners... it's absurd says DOUGLAS CARSWELL . Mr Carswell, arriving at the Houses of Parliament in October, defected from the Conservatives to Ukip . For all the problems in the modern world, most people living in most parts of the planet are better off in 2014 than they were in 2013. People today generally live longer, healthier, more prosperous lives than their parents or grandparents. And 2015 is likely to be even better. Why is life getting better for most people? Because we have become ever more interdependent. Instead of each family, village or country trying to do everything for itself, we have learnt how to do things for each other. As a consequence, there is more for everyone. Far from being Merrie Olde England, life in pre-industrial Britain was grim. Infant mortality was staggeringly high, hunger a constant feature of childhood. Life for the average farm labourer in my part of Essex meant more than 80 hours of unrelenting slog each week. For as long as folk in Essex depended only on other Essex folk for what they had, they did not have very much of it; books, cloth and candles were luxuries. What was true for Essex was true for most communities throughout the world. But then England discovered a remarkable trick; how to depend on others – those outside our counties, then our country and even continent – to provide us voluntarily with the things we needed. There has never been anything splendid about isolation. It was our interdependence that put the Great into Great Britain – and it is what sustains our living standards today. In such a world, a dislike of foreigners is not merely offensive, but absurd. Instead of having to produce most of what we eat within a few miles of where we live, our supermarket shelves are crammed with produce from every country under the sun. Over-consumption is now a bigger public health problem than under-consumption. Our homes are filled with washing machines, iPhones and other modern gizmos from all around the world. Each of those gadgets is itself a product of human interdependence; the microchips made in Japan or South Korea, moulded plastic via Gulf oil, software written by coders in Hoxton or Mumbai. Human interdependence has not only raised living standards here in our country. It is the motor of human progress that has lifted human kind from the swamps to the stars. Globalisation is drawing almost all of humanity into a vast, sprawling network of innovation and exchange. The fundamental challenge for any government – including a Ukip-backed administration – is how we might manage and enhance our interdependence in the decades ahead. Thus far, the established parties in Westminster have done a terrible job of preparing us for the future. Vital, if Britain is to thrive, is the ability of Britons to trade freely and openly with the world. Not only are we trapped inside the only declining trade bloc in the world, being in the EU prevents us from having the open trade relationships with the parts of the world that are growing. Mr Carswell says ahead of May's general election, Ukip 'have to show the whole country that we have what it takes to win big' The EU, beholden to various lobby interests, refuses to sign a free trade deal with India. While Switzerland has concluded a trade agreement with China, the EU has failed to. Rather than enhancing commercial interdependence, Brussels recently fined the UK because we failed to charge high enough protectionist trade tariffs on certain Chinese imports. Far from being a party that tolerates pejorative comments about people’s heritage and background, Ukip in 2015 has to show that we have a serious internationalist agenda. We stand to realign our trade relations precisely because we wish to join in with the rest of the world. Increased interdependence is going to mean ever greater labour mobility – not just between countries but between continents. Voters, in my view, will only accept the labour mobility required if we first control our borders. Preparing for the future means putting in place an immigration system capable of saying a cheery, welcoming ‘Yes’ to doctors from Singapore or scientists from south Asia, and a polite ‘No, thank you’ to someone with a criminal record, or an inclination towards welfare dependence. Angry nativism must have no part in it. Technology already exists that allows hundreds of thousands to log in and out of the London Underground each week. So why has no government managed to devise a system capable of logging folk in and out when they cross our borders? No Ukip candidate should ever make the mistake of blaming outsiders for the failings of political insiders in Westminster. In previous centuries, wealth was created by growing things. Then, during the industrial revolution, by making things. Increasingly, wealth is a matter of intellectual property – or of thinking things. In this world, many British school leavers remain woefully ill-equipped for the skills that they are going to need. Education reform – first under Tony Blair, then David Cameron – has been watered down by vested interests. If Britain is to flourish in the future, we need a government prepared to take on the vested interests, not only in education, but throughout the wider economy. Instead we seem to have governments beholden to different corporate interests. Banks have been endlessly bailed out. Far from competing to attract funds from depositors with generous interest payments, many banks depend on cheap credit handouts from government. The energy market is fixed against the householder. Rather than competing to supply customers with energy at a price they might be willing to pay, energy is generated to comply with quotas. It’s not just the economy that is rigged in the interests of a few. Our political system has become a cosy cartel run in the interests of career politicians looking to get into Parliament. Britain desperately needs political reform to inject a large dose of choice and competition back into politics. Only then can we be certain that the full spectrum of policy options will be considered by policy makers to meet the challenges that lie ahead. Ukip has had a remarkable year. No longer a mere protest party, we won the European elections and showed that we have what it takes to win seats in Parliament. Ahead of May’s General Election, we now have to show the whole country that we have what it takes to win big. That means an optimistic, internationalist and inclusive agenda for the whole country.","Douglas Carswell has said it is offensive and absurd to dislike foreigners .

"An off-duty FBI agent shot and killed a dog as a woman walked it in a park with her four-year-old grandson so he could protect his own pet. Carol Feldhaus was crossing a small bridge in Glen Burnie, Maryland, with her daughter's five-year-old great Dane called Flynn when the undercover officer approached the other side. The two animals then got angry and growled at each, so Mrs Feldhaus asked for him to wait. Scroll down for video . The great Dane called Flynn (pictured) was shot and killed by an undercover an off-duty FBI agent while he was being walked by a woman and her grandson in Glen Burnie, Maryland . Carol Feldhaus, who was knocked off her feet when the animal broke from its leash, still had blood on her hands from where she tried to save the beloved animal . Despite the plea, he carried on, and Flynn broke free from his leash and ran at the other dog. The great Dane attacked, so the undercover officer drew his gun and shot him dead. A devastated Mrs Feldhaus was pulled off her feet and she still had blood on her hands when she spoke to WMAR as the dog approached her covered in blood. She told the station: 'I turned around this guy just kept coming and Fynn the great Dane jerked and pulled me down. 'I heard the dogs barking at each other and growl. Next thing I heard was ""bam bam"". 'And I'm half way up and the dog just walks to me and drops and there's blood everywhere. I was in shock and I said ""you shot the dog?"" And he said he was an undercover cop and he was protecting his dog.' Mrs Feldhaus admitted that Flynn did injure the other dog, but questioned the officers need to use his weapon. The dog's owner and Mrs Feldhaus' daughter Amanda Ericson said Flynn was a gentle giant, but admitted she has been dragged away from other dogs before . Blankets covered in blood remained at the scene from where the owners tried to treat the dogs . She added: 'Pulling a gun and shooting another dog in a park -- what is wrong with this man?' The dog's owner Amanda Ericson said Flynn was normally a gentle giant, but admitted he had been separated by dogs before. However she said that her mother and her young son may need therapy as a result of the tragic incident. FBI spokesman Amy Thoreson told the station: 'There was an FBI Agent involved in an incident in Glen Burnie this morning. Initial information is that an approximately 180 pound dog broke free from the woman walking it along a footpath near Hopkins Corner and attacked a much smaller dog. 'An Agent shot and killed the larger dog. No one else was hurt. We are working jointly with Anne Arundel County PD, as well as the Inspection Division from FBI Headquarters to investigate. 'This is an ongoing matter, and will have more information as soon as we gather more details.' An investigation into the dog's death has been started.","Carol Feldhaus was in a park in Glen Burnie, Maryland, with a great Dane .

"Just before 11am on a crisp March morning, 30 men and women from one of England’s most fashionable hunts gathered near Dorchester. Resplendent in their distinctive ‘True Blue’ livery, Dorset’s Cattistock Hunt members passed around the stirrup cup for the traditional toast before the huntsman blew his horn and the riders cantered off, following their yelping hounds. At the fore was the hunt’s joint master, the Honourable Mrs Charlotte Townshend. Known affectionately to her friends as Blot, Mrs Townshend is rightly proud of the hunt’s 254-year history. In the past both Viscountess Galway and Lady Teresa Agnew have been masters, and today its 250 members include entrepreneur Johnnie Boden, who is vice-president of its pony club. The Cattistock Hunt, one of the richest in the country, has long been a target for anti-hunt protesters determined to prove it flouts hunting laws . On that damp morning of March 11, huntsman Will Bryer decided to take the hunt through picturesque Hardy country on to land west of Weymouth, above the famous Jurassic Coast, where – in keeping with hunting laws – a scented trail had been laid earlier for the hounds to follow. But what none of those riding that morning could have known was that the day’s events would threaten to become a cause celebre, which is now the subject of a court battle. The Cattistock Hunt, one of the richest in the country, has long been a target for anti-hunt protesters determined to prove it flouts hunting laws and that, instead of ensuring the hounds follow the trail, the Cattistock willingly allows them to chase foxes whose scent they pick up. And in this pursuit, the anti-hunt campaigners have a willing partner: the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. Many in the hunting fraternity believe that the court case, in which a member of the Cattistock is accused of a single count of breaching the hunting ban by pursuing a wild mammal with hounds, is the result of collusion between the activists and a partisan RSPCA. They are convinced that the charity has become an increasingly politicised lobby, bent on pursuing an obsessive and costly vendetta against England’s hunting elite. As one insider observed: ‘The lunatics are running the asylum. The RSPCA has become indoctrinated in an animal-rights philosophy, and that is its downfall. ‘The charity is a massive institution with 1,400 employees and an income of more than £120 million, and yet it is run by a board of 21 trustees, few with experience of running a business, and some who are, frankly, staunch animal-rights activists.’ It has even been suggested that, abetted by animal-rights activists, the RSPCA has been targeting well-heeled hunting communities in a cynical bid to raise its profile. Tthe Honourable Mrs Charlotte Townshend has been singled out as someone who represents everything the activists despise about Britain’s hunting history . Many, too, are concerned that the charity is ‘wasting’ too much of its fortune – made up mostly from donations and legacies – chasing minor misdemeanours. The Mail on Sunday reported in October that the RSPCA had spent £22.5 million on prosecutions in two years, and today we can reveal that the charity has been forced to take out an overdraft facility with its bank, Coutts, for the first time in its 190-year history. The Cattistock case epitomises the battle for the soul of the British countryside. So far as the hunters are concerned, they have today become the hunted – followed and filmed by a battery of anti-hunt activists including Dorset hunt saboteurs, the anti-hunt group Protect Our Wild Animals, and monitors for the International Fund for Animal Welfare (IFAW). They hand over yards of footage to the RSPCA in the hope that it will provide evidence upon which the charity can press charges. In the dock is Will Bryer, Mrs Townshend’s fellow huntmaster. Mr Bryer has pleaded not guilty at Weymouth Magistrates’ Court to breaching the hunting ban and will mount a vigorous defence when the case comes to trial in the spring. His solicitor, Jamie Foster, insists Mr Bryer is innocent. ‘He will vigorously contest what appears to be an extremely weak case,’ he says. ‘I am very surprised it has made it this far.’ The prosecution’s case will hinge on footage filmed as the hunt passed the picturesque village of Langton Herring. Taken with a hand-held camera by Kevin Hill, from the IFAW, it was subsequently passed to the RSPCA rather than to the police or the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS). It is said to depict Mr Bryer allowing two hounds to chase a fox, allegedly in breach of the Hunting Act 2004. The IFAW has been delighted by the prosecution. Its members and fellow activists have long disliked the Cattistock Hunt, seeing it as symbolic of hunting’s aristocratic past. As one anti-hunt activist explains: ‘It is run along feudal lines. Landowners and farmers are encouraged to give permission for the hunt to make use of their land – there might, for example, be the offer of the loan of some farm equipment you especially need.’ Mrs Townshend has been singled out as someone who represents everything the activists despise about Britain’s hunting history. A committed wildlife conservationist, Mrs Townshend has already been targeted by animal-rights activists, who mistakenly believed she supported trials for the Government’s badger cull and would allow one to take place on her Dorset estate. She was forced to make a ‘painful decision’ to step down as patron of the Dorset Wildlife Trust, fearing that the work of the charity, founded by her grandfather more than half a century ago, would be compromised by her continued presence. Activists inundated the DWT’s Facebook and Twitter pages with abusive messages. It became a systematic campaign eventually linked to the discovery of ‘suspicious figures’ hanging around Mrs Townshend’s home. Security had to be stepped up after a picture of the house was published on Stop The Cull’s website with the words ‘Badger killer Charlotte Townshend’ written, graffiti-style, in bright red. As for the court case, it is understood that even Kevin Hill, who shot the footage, is privately doubtful that Mr Bryer will be convicted. He has admitted to friends that the film was taken from some distance and identification will be disputed. Whatever the outcome, the case will once again turn the spotlight on the close relationship between the RSPCA and the animal- rights movements. During the autumn, an independent report by Stephen Wooler, a former chief inspector of the Crown Prosecution Service Inspectorate, recommended that the charity should pass on any evidence of law-breaking to either the police or CPS. Since then, the charity has indicated that in future it will abide by the Wooler recommendations. The case, however, calls that commitment into question. Why, for example, is the RSPCA mounting this prosecution and not the police? Tim Bonner, director of campaigns for the Countryside Alliance, said: ‘It clearly cannot make an objective decision. We believe this decision involving Cattistock has a blatant political element to it. ‘The Cattistock has been harassed by employees of animal-rights organisations carrying out covert surveillance for almost ten years and, until now, there has not been a single prosecution, let alone a conviction.’ He believes the Cattistock has no case to answer. ‘We have every confidence that Cattistock was operating entirely legally on the day in question and we don’t believe the evidence justifies the prosecution,’ he says. Even Graham Forsyth, an anti-hunt supporter who regularly monitors hunts and reports his finding to the charity, admits that the Cattistock Hunt is well organised. ‘I would say it is one of the better managed and more disciplined hunts, despite some of the incidents recorded against it in the past,’ he says. ‘Generally speaking, if Charlotte and her husband are out riding, things tend to be calmer because they tolerate us – although they ignore us – and try to ensure none of the others gets involved either.’ So why is the RSPCA so keen to prosecute Mr Bryer? Its official explanation is that ‘there is a public interest in bringing such a prosecution’. A charity spokesman added: ‘We look closely at whether the quality of the evidence meets the usual tests too. We take our enforcement role seriously.’ Protest: An anti-hunt campaigner holds up his banner in 2005 after The Hunting Act was passed . But one animal-rights supporter with knowledge of the case believes much of it is a face-saving exercise. ‘The RSPCA was very keen to run this one up the flagpole in the wake of the Wooler report to prove it was still a force to be reckoned with,’ he said. ‘But we’re not confident it will go the distance and if it does, we don’t think it will result in a conviction. ‘Proving identification is incredibly difficult at the best of times. And this isn’t the best evidence. They know that. But they think there is a chance.’ Certainly, as a charity the RSPCA is under pressure to explain its prosecutions policy. And internally it is riven with disagreements between the old guard, who fear donations will dry up if it becomes too political, and hardline activists. Although the charity, whose patron is the Queen, remains one of the wealthiest in the UK, with investment assets of £82 million, much of this cash is thought to be tied up in long-term deals. One person involved in animal rescue said: ‘I have been told the past three months have been like a white-knuckle ride in making payments and that the RSPCA has had to go to the bank and agree an overdraft for the first time.’ In a statement, the RSPCA confirmed it had made ‘contingency plans to ensure efficient cash flow’ and had negotiated an overdraft, but insisted: ‘We have not used this facility and do not foresee any reason to use it at this present time.’ For the Cattistock Hunt it was business as usual for the Boxing Day meet. ‘They are quietly confident that Mr Bryer will be acquitted eventually,’ says one local landowner. ‘If the court has any sense, the case will be thrown out. That is the thinking around here.’ Additional reporting: Valerie Elliott .","Honourable Mrs Charlotte Townshend is master of Dorset’s Cattistock Hunt .

"Ever felt like getting away from it all? Well one Kansas couple took that adage really to heart and departed on an incredible adventure across the U.S. with their young son - quitting their jobs and selling everything they owned to do it. Joshua and Jessa Works decided to ditch their nine-to-five routine in order to travel the U.S. almost four years ago and have spent since 2011 living out of the 27-foot airbus they bought to replace their five-bedroom house and everything inside it. Sharing images on their blog Tomorrow Somewhere New, the family has visited locations from Hawaii to New York and Yellowstone to Niagara Falls - a whopping 47 U.S states in total.

New horizons: They have spent since 2011 living out of the 27-foot airbus they bought to replace their five-bedroom house and everything inside it . Quite the change from their old lives which they described as a ‘loop-de-loop routine of commutes, cooking, cleaning and being couch potatoes’. ‘I think we just get caught up in chasing some sort of version of success. We had excellent jobs that would allow us to do that except for the time that we wanted to be spending outdoors,’ Joshua said in a Dark Rye film about the trip. ‘So we decided to sell all of our stuff, sell our cars, put our house on the market, buy an Airstream and hit the road.’ ‘Once he started pointing out that we were set in this routine that may in fact be the same routine that we would be living for the rest of our lives, we started looking at it much more closely,’ Jessa adds on the film. ‘How many of those choices, were choices we had made? Really none of it was.’ The couple invested in improving a basic Airstream travel trailer to include mod-cons like an Apple computer and memory foam mattresses. They made-over the sleeping arrangements (a pair of bunk beds) and the kitchen and bathroom until the bus more closely resembled a modern and chic - if a little compact - family home. 47 states: The family have been traveling since 2011 and have visited numerous sights and beautiful landscapes across the U.S. Sights: The Works family were tired of routine and their normal nine to five lives when they decided to trade them in for a U.S. adventure .

New challenges: Quite the change from their old lives which they described as a ‘loop-de-loop routine of commutes, cooking, cleaning and being couch potatoes’ As a web developer and graphic designer, Joshua and Jessa, respectively, left their jobs behind but were able to work freelance while on the move so they could afford to keep funding their travelling existence. Belongings were kept to a handful of goods and even Jack’s toys were ditched in the clearout however the couple say the adventure alone was more than enough to keep him entertained. On the latest set of family photos Jack can be seen enjoying July 4 in the Grand Canyon and flashes a huge smile as he collects sticks and rambles across the great american outdoors. ‘It’s become this amazing tool for Jack. We knew when we started it would be a great opportunity for him but we had no idea how powerful it would be for his creativity and imagination,’ Jessa explained. ‘We’ve traded our small back yard for this expansive world,’ Joshua added. 'Amazing tool': Jessa Works said the adventure was an amazing experience for the couple's young son and boosted his creativity and imagination .

Wisdom: ‘The hardest part of doing something interested is getting started. If we can convince ourselves to get on our coats and get on our backpacks something great can happen,’ Josh concludes . That’s not to say the entire trip has been smooth sailing.

"A  Scrooge got his comeuppance this Christmas when he allegedly tried to grab an elderly woman's purse and got a beat down by her senior friends instead. Armed robber Larry Kent Jr., 45, attempting to nab the purse of a 68-year-old woman outside of a Chinese Food restaurant in Winter Haven, Florida got tackled to the ground by the woman's geriatric friends aged 73 and 66. 'Mr. Kent is spending his Christmas, and we can only hope many, many, more behind bars,' Jamie Brown with the Winter Haven Police Department told Fox. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . No match for the seniors: Armed alleged robber Larry Kent Jr., 45, attempting to nab the purse of a 68-year-old woman got tackled to the ground by the woman's geriatric friends aged 73 and 66 . Pinned: Larry Kent Jr., 45, is no match for this group of riled up senior citizens in Florida on Christmas  day . Defeat: Larry Kent Jr., 45, may have assumed that a 68-year-old woman would be an easy target to steal from but the alleged thief was proven wrong and taken into custody . The old woman, who has not been named, refused to let the robber take advantage of her and steal her purse. Two of the woman's friends helped pin Kent to the ground before the police arrived to put the alleged thief in the slammer. A witness Pat Cameron heard the commotion and jumped into the fight to ensure that none of the seniors got hurt. 'His legs were kicking this that and the other, so I grabbed his legs so he wouldn't kick the others,' said Pat Cameron. 'I didn't care that he had a gun, I just wanted to help them out,' he added. Pat's wife Glenda also witnessed the fight but she opted out of getting too involved. In custody: The alleged thief is a convicted felon who's been arrested 17 times in Polk County . Witness: 'His legs were kicking this that and the other, so I grabbed his legs so he wouldn't kick the others,' said witness Pat Cameron who stepped in to help stave off the alleged bandit . 'I was a little concerned,' said Pat's wife Glenda. 'I said just don't get involved but I'm glad he did go over because it could've been me.' None of the people involved in the fight were injured and police discovered Kent's gun was merely a BB gun. 'I even said to the police officers don't mess with the seniors they fight back,' said Glenda Cameron.

"Rail passengers told last night how they feared a Hillsborough-style disaster when thousands were trapped inside a station as travel chaos hit Britain – and the severe weather added to the Christmas misery for millions. The mayhem across the rail network was caused by overrunning engineering works at some of the country's busiest stations – to the fury of Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin who last night read the riot act to Network Rail's chief executive. The most chaotic scenes were at the Finsbury Park station in North London yesterday, which had to be closed by police for two hours from 11am because so many travellers had been diverted there from the much larger King's Cross. Scroll down for video . Passengers were left stranded outside Finsbury Park, which shut when it was overwhelmed by crowds . There was also chaos at London Waterloo on the day there was mayhem across the rail network . Passengers faced long queues at Finsbury Park in North London - the station later closed amid safety fears . The announcement that King's Cross services were being affected only came late on Boxing Day and gave passengers little time to change their travel plans. Margaret Sims, 67, who was caught up in the crush as she tried to travel home to Leeds, told The Mail on Sunday: 'The platform was jammed with people trying to get off the train. It was a Hillsborough situation.' Susan Delgado, 57, from North London, who abandoned plans to visit friends in Cambridge, said: 'It was really unpleasant and jam-packed – some platforms were completely full of people right to the edge. I called the police at 10am but it took them so long to take any action. 'Finsbury Park is a small station on a suburban line. Sending everyone there from King's Cross – a major transport hub – was absolutely ludicrous and quite dangerous. Heads should roll.' Train passengers are braced for a second day of travel misery as it is announced workers at King's Cross will toil through the night in an attempt to open the station tomorrow . King's Cross was closed due to the overrunning works, with thousands of commuters directed to Finsbury Park station instead . Hundreds of travellers reported being left outside the station for up to 90 minutes in freezing wind and rain as a dozen station staff were overwhelmed by the crowds . Outraged Mr McLoughlin last night said the situation was 'totally unacceptable' in a frank phone call to Mark Carne, the £675,000-a-year chief executive of Network Rail. The company receives £3.2 billion of taxpayers' money each year to maintain the tracks. Mr McLoughlin said: 'The situation on the railways this weekend has been totally unacceptable. Passengers must be able to trust that vital engineering works will be completed on time.' An investigation was launched by the rail watchdog, the Office of the Rail Regulator, to establish why the planned maintenance works failed to be completed on time despite thousands of engineers toiling around the clock on Christmas Day and Boxing Day. In the worst day of disruption this winter, ice and snow in the north of England and the Midlands caused havoc on the roads, left 100,000 homes without power and led to the cancellation of scores of flights. However, rail passengers suffered the most with hours of delays. Speaking to Mail Online, passenger Dean Pugh, who was travelling from Darlington, said: 'Our train was packed. When it arrived there were around a thousand or so people trying to get on it to head north, using the same stairs we were using to get off. 'Everything came to a standstill for 45 minutes before anyone took charge. At first they tried to push us to the back of the platform to get people on to the train, then held boarding passengers back and let us go. 'There were around a dozen East Coast staff and a dozen police officers there, but they were both asking one another what to do and nobody was taking charge.' Network Rail, who are responsible for the engineering works, said labourers will stay on site overnight and hope to have a reduced service running tomorrow . No more snow is forecast for Britain next week, but there was relief yesterday for thousands of UK skiers who went abroad desperate to find it – the biggest falls of the season so far have transformed barren slopes in the Alps. Andrew Frawley, of chalet company Nomadic Ski in Chamonix in the French Alps, said: 'Christmas was tough with the lack of snow but New Year guests are going to have a wonderful time.' Jim Ewing, who was trying to travel to Edinburgh from London, said: 'I got off at Finsbury Park tube station and waited in a queue for half an hour with no information, before one staff member appeared and asked everyone to move back. 'There wasn't much room so that raised a few grumbles but everyone was generally in good spirits, however after an hour stuck in a tunnel and moving just 20ft the police appeared. 'We were told we had to wait for a platform to be cleared, and had to stand for another 20 minutes in the tunnels. 'Eventually we made it on to the platform and I was very relieved to be back in the fresh air.' George Hallam, a semi-retired economics lecturer from Lewisham, was among the crowds waiting to get on a train at Finsbury Park. He said: 'Any civil engineering contractor would have realised probably weeks ago that they were going to overrun and they must have realised they would be fined. 'They could have solved that by putting on more resources, more people, more machines - but if the cost of that is more than the fine then they would choose to pay the fine. 'The staff are telling people the problem, but not the extent of it. People are still arriving and waiting in the cold. 'There are a lot of vulnerable people here. My mother-in-law is 94, we managed to get her into a taxi some time ago. But the train companies ought to be arranging coaches, not taxis.' Sources said that the station would effectively be closed  due to delays to works north of the station . Lindesay Irvine, 45, a journalist, said he was stuck on a 'dangerously overcrowded' train after two train-loads of people, one from Bristol and one from Cornwall, were merged into one. Mr Irvine, who was travelling to Paddington after spending Christmas with family in Bristol, said: 'They have decided to run two trains worth of people on one train. It is dangerously overcrowded. 'In health and safety terms this must be well against the law. There is not an inch of room. At the last station people tried to get on but couldn't. One person has been taken ill on the train. 'There is no room, no information and no apology. It is unacceptable. The engineering works have over-run from Christmas but they have had plenty of time to prepare. 'My Christmas in Bristol was close to perfect. And now thanks to Great Western I've been left very angry at the end of my Christmas break.' Fellow passenger Lynda Pollard, 62, said: 'It is packed. You have got to fight your way through to the bathroom. It is so crowded you can barely move. Why have they not laid coaches on? 'The overcrowding is horrendous. There is no way of getting any food or water. It is dreadful.' Passengers with large suitcases at Finsbury Park station this morning, where trains were moved to different platforms at short notice . Customers will need to start or finish their journey at Finsbury Park in north London, with at least one change of train, according to East Coast Trains . Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin says he will be asking Network Rail what went wrong and what lessons can be learnt . Network Rail apologised for the chaos and pledged to fix the problem by tomorrow when millions of commuters return to work. The mayhem – which affected trains to and from Scotland, the north of England, the Midlands and the West Country – started after engineers failed to lay new tracks on time at King's Cross. Meanwhile, overrunning works west of Reading and a signalling fault at Paddington meant there was a 'very limited' service there – forcing thousands to head to London's Waterloo station to catch trains to the West. Robin Gisby, managing director of network operations at Network Rail, said last night: 'I'm deeply sorry for the upheaval caused today. We've had an army of 11,000 engineers out over Christmas Day and Boxing Day at 2,000 locations nationwide. More than 90 per cent have been completed and handed back in time. 'Extra resources have been brought in to ensure the work is completed for the morning and we will then spend some time to better understand what went wrong.' Bad timing: Claire Perry (pictured) claimed there was light at the end of the tunnel for passengers . Outspoken Rail Minister Claire Perry had egg on her face after boasting about rail repairs in her Christmas message. At last there was light at the end of the tunnel for passengers, said Ms Perry in a message to her constituents in Devizes. Two days later the railways were plunged into chaos. Ms Perry's message said: '10,000 Network Rail employees will be working over the holiday period on thousands of projects, carrying the biggest upgrade of the network since Victorian times. 'Someone said politicians are people who, when they see the light at the end of the tunnel, order more tunnel. Well not any more as big rail projects come to fruition.'","Rail passengers said how they feared Hillsborough-style disaster .

"This is the man who allegedly ruined Christmas for thousands of children after bringing down the Xbox and Playstation networks. In a brazen television interview, the man, who went by the name 'Ryan' said he and a small group launched the Christmas Day cyber attack on computer games consoles. He claimed that the group he was part of carried out the hack partly for amusement - and to expose poor security. December 25 was ruined for children across the country who were forced to abandon plans to spend the holidays in a virtual world playing on their new Playstation or Xbox games systems due to internet hackers. Scroll down for video . In a brazen television interview, the man (pictured), who went by the name 'Ryan' said he and a small group launched the Christmas Day cyber attack on computer games consoles. Children were reduced to tears during the 'worst Christmas ever' and parents fumed about paying hundreds of pounds for games consoles that could not be used. A notorious group of hackers called Lizard Squad said it carried out the hack 'for the laughs' and to expose poor online security. Now the man known as Ryan - who is thought to be a member of the group - has given an interview on Sky News saying a small team had masterminded the attack, adding that he understood 'it's a bit unethical'. Speaking from Finland, he said: 'This attack was basically done by three people. We had a couple of people from outside the group helping with the attacks, helping us a little bit, but most of the traffic was coming from one or two people. Mark Haynes said there had been 'tantrums, tears and everything else' after attempts to set up the Xbox One console he had bought for his children Archie (pictured), 13, and Olivia, 11, kept failing . Gamers around the world were left disappointed on Christmas Day after hacking group Lizard Squad carried through with its threat to bring down both Sony's PlayStation Network and Microsoft's Xbox Live service . When asked why the group carried out the attack he said: 'Mostly to raise awareness - to amuse ourselves. 'Also one of the big aspects here was raising awareness regarding the low state of computer security at these companies.' He added that he would be 'worried' if children 'didn't have anything better to do than play games on their consoles on Christmas Eve and Christmas Day.' Meanwhile, a British man was last night named as one of the hackers who carried out the devastating attack. Vincent Omari was said by a rival group to be a member of Lizard Squad. Last night Mr Omari, 22, denied the accusation. Speaking outside his parents’ home in Twickenham, South-West London, he said: ‘I am not a member of Lizard Squad. I am not one of the hackers. It is a case of mistaken identity.’ However, in messages believed to have been posted by Omari, a Twitter user with the tag @VinnSec admitted he was the ‘spokesperson for the group’, adding that police knew about cyber attack ‘and they have all my info if needed’. Earlier, Mr Omari spoke to Sky News and presented himself as ‘an independent security analyst’, without any suggestion of him being a member of the hacking group. Lizard Squad first announced that it planned to take down the PlayStation Network and Xbox Live on Christmas Day in early December, describing itself as the 'next generation Grinch' However, on BBC Radio 5 Live, an unnamed man with an identical voice who said he had just turned 22 admitted being part of the attack. Mr Omari turned 22 on Christmas Eve. A second Lizard Squad member has been identified online as a 16-year-old grammar schoolboy in Kent. The consoles rely on an internet connection for many of their functions. Parents were so angered by the issues with the machines, which cost up to £349, that they wrote hundreds of messages to both companies on Twitter accompanied by the message '#christmasruined'. Ros Bruce said her ten-year-old son had spent weeks planning what games he and his friend would play together ahead of receiving an Xbox One for Christmas. The boy was sorely disappointed when he tried to download a game and was still unable to play it more than 15 hours later. Miss Bruce, from Essex, said: 'He has spent most of the day in tears. He says it's been his worst Christmas ever. I think Xbox should compensate us all.' A Twitter user from Scotland also called for a refund and said: '£450 later and the kids have an expensive plastic paperweight.' Mark Haynes told the Daily Mail there had been 'tantrums, tears and everything else' after attempts to set up the Xbox One console he had bought for his children Archie, 13, and Olivia, 11, kept failing. Mr Haynes, 50, from Ely, Cambridgeshire, criticised Microsoft's response to the problem after calling technical support four times only to be told by one staff member that the company 'had no idea what was going on'. The hack took down Microsoft's Xbox Live and Sony's PlayStation Network. Popular games such as Call Of Duty and The Sims 4 were all but useless for frustrated gamers. Analysts said that the attack was a DDOS, or distributed denial of service attack, in which online networks are overwhelmed by traffic, leaving normal users unable to gain access. One of the most popular features of the consoles is the ability to play against friends and other users who are in different locations. This feature, however, requires an internet connection and many children were left disappointed at their inability to use it. While an internet connection is not required to play all games, new Xbox One consoles need to be online to be successfully set-up. Many of those who received the consoles as Christmas presents are thought to have experienced problems getting started. Furthermore, games on both consoles often require an internet connection to be installed fully, which was ruled out by the hack. A message on the Xbox status page yesterday said that its core services were 'up and running' but PlayStation said engineers were continuing to work on 'network issues'. There has been no official link between the incident and the infiltration of Sony's computers by hackers said to be working for North Korea. However, Sony and Microsoft were heavily involved in the release of The Interview, the comedy film about the communist nation which has angered its tyrannical leader Kim Jong-Un; the film centres on a plot by two American journalists to assassinate him. Sony's entertainment division produced the movie, and Microsoft made it available to stream on its Xbox film service. There are 48million worldwide subscribers to the Xbox's internet features, and more than double that for the PlayStation, which has some 110million. Last month Sony announced that it had sold one million consoles in the UK just eight months after launching, with a sales boost expected before Christmas. In an interview on tech website Winbeta, Lizard Squad said that it had carried out the attack on Christmas Day to 'anger and reach the largest amount of people'. It claimed that the attack was to highlight poor online security and that Microsoft had barely any protection at all for its Xbox online network. Earlier today, it was revealed how a gang of internet hackers claiming an affiliation with shadowy anarchist group Anonymous claimed it had leaked the details of more than 13,000 users of Playstation, Xbox and online stores including Amazon. The hackers posted a document online containing username and password combinations. They also added credit card numbers as well as expiry dates. The group told their followers that they hacked the account details 'for the Lulz'. According to Dailydot.com , the hackers released account information from users of Xbox Live, Sony Playstation Network and Twitch.tv. The hackers also released details they claimed came from retailers such as Walmart and Amazon. They also released details from a host of pornography websites. In addition they ripped Sony's controversial movie The Interview and uploaded it to a file-sharing website where it could be downloaded illegally. It is understood that thousands of gamers have already complained to both Sony and Microsoft who have been hit by the network problems. The hackers are believed to have used a denial of service attack, where they bombard the targets servers with internet traffic forcing it to shut down and preventing legitimate access. The hackers claimed on Twitter to have released customer information of some 13,000 account holders . They also claimed to have ripped a copy of The Interview which could then be downloaded illegally .","Hackers took down PlayStation and Xbox networks on Christmas Day .

"Furious Aussie travellers have had their holiday plans ruined when they were sent what they say was the 'the worst text' on Christmas Day – cancelling their flights with just a day's notice. The Indonesian 'AirAsia' airline had been promoting their new route for months, promising to fly passengers directly from Melbourne to Bali after a December 26 launch. Instead, they sent out frantic texts on Christmas Day to passengers, informing them that flights from Boxing Day onwards were not only cancelled, but their expected travel time on their new flights was now doubled from five-and-a-half hours to a lengthy 13 hours. Weddings and travel plans went out the window when the commuters were informed they would now stop over at Kuala Lumpur, meaning many travellers would arrive a day later than they had planned. Scroll down for video . AirAsia X have cancelled their planned Melbourne to Bali flights until further notice after 'unforseen' administration and approval issues . Julie Chumbley (left) is devastated that her daughter's Bali wedding has been 'wrecked' because her immediate family has been stranded by the flight change . Julie Chumbley took to Facebook to express her anger and disappointment at the change and the way the airline conducted themselves . 'Thank you for wrecking our family Christmas and my daughters wedding!! My daughter is due to be married on the 28th dec 2014 in bali and my daughter in law is a bridsemade(sic) and my son is walking her down the isle (sic). 'This was until you changed my daughter in laws and sons direct flight from the 27th dec 2014 to leave on the 28th dec with a stop over in kuala lumpur in which they will miss the whole wedding!!' wrote Julie Chumbley. It all occurred due to an 'administration issue' according to Air Asia. Rumours are flying, unlike the airline, that AirAsia is not authorised by air controllers to fly from Melbourne to Denpasar. An AirAsia X spokesman confirmed that 'an unforseen delay in the approval process for necessary documentation,' was the reason for the delay. 'Indonesia AirAsia X is working closely with all relevant authorities including the Directorate General of Civil Aviation and CASA (Civil Aviation Safety Authority) to ensure that the administration process can be completed as soon as possible,' an AirAsia X spokesman told Daily Mail Australia. 'Indonesia AirAsia X will commence the direct return flight from Denpasar to Melbourne as scheduled as soon as this process has been completed. Passengers have been put on new flights and will now have to change over at Kuala Lumpur airport (pictured) Nick Brown (left) and Angela Menz (right) are furious that their flights have been cancelled and that they have received 'appalling customer service' by writing messages on Facebook . Travellers are enraged that the airline has been selling tickets for the flights since October, pledging to carry 377 passengers five times a week. The AirAsia Facebook page has been flooded with angry messages from jilted customers, complaining about the major gaffe. 'You shouldn't have advertised/sold flights under the guise of them being available when they weren't. If you weren't allowed to fly direct from Melbourne – Bali then why advertise that you can?' wrote Dean Schultz. 'I am keen to investigate under ACCC as this surely is false advertising,' added Ann Thorpe. 'This morning (Christmas morning) we got a phonecall from Airasia saying that our flight to Bali which was scheduled to leave at 10:40 am on the 26th of Dec (tomorrow) has been delayed to 05:00 pm and will fly thru KL instead of being a direct flight. We were supposed to reach Bali at 01:00 pm but now we will reach 14 hours later at 03:00 am,' explained Nisha Tahiliani. Ms Menz is furious that her 'transfers and accommodation' are now going to waste and is concerned that she does not know what will happen with her return flight, which had promised to fly her straight from Bali to Melbourne with AirAsia . Nick Brown was concerned that he had not been contacted about whether or not his December 28 flight would be affected, despite the news that flights were indefinitely grounded . Ms Chumbley is devastated about the impact this decision has had on her daughter's wedding, which was further exacerbated by the 'poor service' they received from AirAsia. She explained in her Facebook page that that they were 'hung up on fifteen times' while trying to change their flights, and then transferred to a call centre where they encountered a serious language barrier. 'This service is beyond unacceptable and due to this my two kids will miss this very special day and they cannot afford another $1700 each to change their flights!' 'The biggest issue is that it's such short notice that all the other direct flights are more than $1000 direct,' affected traveller Ognjen Zec told Daily Mail Australia. Other customers are livid that AirAsia will not compensate the travellers for the prepaid accommodation, transfers and other activities which will be missed due to the last-minute change in their flights. An AirAsia X spokesman confirmed that 'an unforseen delay in the approval process for necessary documentation,' was the reason for the delay . Traveller Ann Thorpe wrote a bitter message on Facebook, sarcastically posting 'thanks for the Merry Xmas text' On their Facebook page, AirAsia sent messages to furious customers to apologise for the fiasco. 'The re-route via KL (Kuala Lumpur) is a temporary solution as we work with authorities in the coming days to overcome the issue,' wrote AirAsia on Facebook, not explaining to customers what exactly the 'issue' is which has caused all flights to be cancelled. Customers were not satisfied by AirAsia's response when they demanded to know how they would be compensated for the lost funds. 'For any extra costs, we recommend you contact your travel insurance provider. This is a temporary issue, and we're working with government agencies to be able to commence our direct services as soon as possible in the near future.' Nick Brown was pro-active, asking AirAsia on Facebook if they could give him slightly more notice if his December 28 flight was set to be re-routed. 'Any idea if the direct flight from Melbourne to Bali on the 28th departing at 10:40 will be re-routed as well? Thought I'd be proactive and ask here first rather than wait for the news to be delivered by carrier pigeon 7 days after my flight.' Michelle Sharp will also miss a friend's wedding and is angry that the airline doesn't seem to care, because they already have her 'hard earned money' Some travellers will arrive at Denpasar Airport more than 24 hours than they had originally planned .","AirAsia have cancelled all direct flights from Melbourne to Bali .

"This is the dramatic moment a  Syrian boy escaped from Isis  - by volunteering as a suicide bomber and then handing himself in at the mosque he was meant to blow up. Usaid Barho had a bomb vest strapped to his body before travelling to a Shi'ite mosque in Baghdad, Iraq where he was supposed to detonate the explosive device. But rather than killing himself and countless others, he took the brave decision to defy his orders by unzipping his jacket and handing himself in to guards standing nearby. Syrian teenager Usaid Barho, pictured left, approached guards at a mosque in Baghdad to turn himself in. Video footage showed officers removing the bomb vest he was wearing (right) Video footage shows the tense moment an officer gently removes part of the deadly equipment strapped to his body in front of stunned onlookers. He had reportedly walked up to the gates of the mosque in the Bayaa district of Baghdad before telling guards he did not want to blow himself up. The New York Times reports how Usaid had dreamed of becoming a doctor before he said he was recruited by Isis extremists in his hometown of Manbij, Syria. He joined because he 'believed in Islam' but soon became disillusioned and was told that if he did not fight, Shi'ites would rape his mother. The New York Times quotes him as saying: 'They seduced us to join the caliphate. 'They planted the idea that Shi'ites are infidels and we had to kill them.' Video footage shows the tense moment an officer gently removes the deadly equipment strapped to Usaid's in front of stunned onlookers . The newspaper describes how he was taken to a training camp before being given a choice of becoming a fighter or a suicide bomber. He chose the latter hoping he could immediately surrender. The teenager reportedly said: 'I raised my hand to be a suicide bomber. 'If I were a fighter and tried to surrender to security forces they might kill me, with my gun in my hand.' Usaid was reportedly transferred from one Isis operative to another as he made his journey towards the mosque before he was finally given his target and informed of his target. It is believed that the teenager is currently being held at an Iraqi intelligence site. Earlier this month, experts revealed how Islamic State sees children as central to its plans for a caliphate in the Middle East and encouraged fighters to indoctrinate them to a life of violence from an early age. There was also evidence that young boys were routinely fighting in battles alongside their parents. He had reportedly walked up to the gates of the mosque in the Bayaa district of Baghdad before telling guards he did not want to blow himself up . If they are killed images of their bodies are circulated online, where they are praised as martyrs. Terror soldiers from ISIS will often post images of their youngest fighters online, some barely five or six years old, posing alongside guns, dead bodies, and the group's black and white flag. Images have also been posted on Twitter of children carrying out mock-beheadings using dolls and action figures, which are then posed to resemble captives murdered by 'Jihadi John'. In a report on children and ISIS, a spokesman for the Middle Eastern Media Research institute (MEMRI) said: 'Children are central to ISIS; they are the future generation of the defenders of the caliphate and they will continue its legacy. 'ISIS children receive military training, both in camps conducted by the organisation and individually, with ISIS fighters. 'There is little discussion, in the organization and among its supporters, over whether children should be undergoing military training, or even fighting in actual battles.'","Usaid Barho was recruited by extremists in home town of Manbij in Syria .

"It was Christmas and it was time for the Uttar Pradesh top babu to relax. But it had to be amid the tigers, in the loving company of his wife, son and daughter. So Uttar Pradesh chief secretary Alok Ranjan chose to play Santa Claus for his family and go on an ‘all-expenses-paid’ pleasure trip to the Pilibhit Tiger Reserve on December 25. And it put the entire district administration and machinery into a tizzy. Everyone scurried to ensure that the babu and his family were kept in good humour; their ‘pleasure’ was the top priority for the Pilibhit district magistrate Om Narayan Singh, the SSP and the rest of the officials who scrambled to satisfy Ranjan. Pleasure trip: Uttar Pradesh chief secretary Alok Ranjan chose to play Santa Claus for his family and go on an ‘all-expenses-paid’ pleasure trip to the Pilibhit Tiger Reserve on December 25 . VIP travel: It was around 1pm on December 25 that the state government’s helicopter carried Ranjan and his family members to the Pilibhit Tiger Reserve . Chief Secratary Alok Ranjan pictured with his wife Surabhi Ranjan (right). The entire trip was kept as a closely-guarded secret, away from the eyes of the media . Administrative sources informed Mail Today that the government spent about Rs 25 lakh for Ranjan’s pleasure trip. About 23 air conditioners and 20 silent generators were installed to ensure that the chief secretary and his family members feel comfortable at the government’s guest house. Sources informed Mail Today that the air conditioners kept Ranjan and his family warm at about 22 degrees Celsius inside the guest house, away from the freezing cold outside. Additionally, a Bhojpuri artiste — Junior Baleshwar Yadav — and his troupe of six performers were reportedly paid Rs 70,000 to entertain Ranjan and his family on December 25. However, the ruling Samajwadi Party is claiming ignorance. Samajwadi Party spokesperson Rajendra Chaudhary told Mail Today: “He was on a three-day official visit to inspect various government schemes. ""I have no knowledge whether his family accompanied him. If any such thing has happened we will probe the matter.” Public money . But, the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party is mincing no words. “Whether the ministers or the bureaucrats in this state… they all are using public money on such lavish activities. If Ranjan was on an ‘official’ visit then why did he take his family along with him to celebrate Christmas holidays?” state BJP spokesperson Vijay Bahadur Pathak told Mail Today. It was around 1pm on December 25 that the state government’s helicopter carried Ranjan and his family members to the Pilibhit Tiger Reserve. Confirming this fact forest ranger K.P. Singh told Mail Today: “His chopper arrived here on December 25 afternoon. He was accompanied by his family members.” Ideally, the helicopter should not have landed there at all. But flouting all norms about wildlife protection, a helipad was hurriedly set up at the Chuka spot within the Reserve. The entire police machinery did whatever they could to ensure that the ‘illegal’ helipad becomes operational to ensure Ranjan and family’s safe landing inside the tiger turf. Both the district magistrate and the SSP were present at the helipad to welcome the chief secretary and his family. Government officials unloaded their baggage and spared no effort so that the chief secretary and his family feel comfortable. The group was then escorted to the VVIP guest house of the Reserve as the staffers and the government officials got ready to “look after the special guests for the next three days”. Ranjan did not answer questions as to why his family accompanied him or about the expenses incurred by the government for this ‘private’ trip . The holidaying group stayed there till Saturday afternoon and then left the Reserve for Lakhimpur. From Lakhimpur they took a flight to state Capital Lucknow the same day. “Ranjan and his family stayed here for three days and left for Kishanpur Sanctuary in the adjoining Lakhimpur district by road,” an administrative official of Pilibhit confirmed to Mail Today, preferring anonymity. It’s not that Ranjan, a senior IAS officer, was unaware of the implications of using the government machinery and spending government’s money for this ‘private’ trip on Christmas. So, the entire trip was kept as a closely-guarded secret, away from the eyes of the media. In fact, to avoid spreading of the news of his visit, the government helicopter was sent back to Lucknow on December 26 morning. However, the ‘secret’ visit did not remain a secret, thanks to a sanctuary staff who captured the babu’s grand welcome in a video. This video has now reached journalists who are now raising uncomfortable questions with Ranjan. However, the chief secretary appeared unperturbed with the questions. He claimed that the visit to the Tiger Reserve was “official”. He also did not answer questions as to why his family accompanied him or about the expenses incurred by the government for this ‘private’ trip; Ranjan preferred to duck the posers with a smile. Talking to reporters in Lakhimpur, before leaving for Lucknow, Ranjan said: “We are in talks with the BSNL for ensuring a mobile network in this region as we have received various complaints about lack of communication network in this region. ""The government is also working on connecting the Katarniya Ghat, Dudhwa National Park, Lakhimpur Sanctuary and the Pilibhit Tiger Reserve with two-lane roads. ""Currently, these national parks have single-road connectivity and we are in the process of providing a two-lane road.” Indeed, the area doesn’t have functional mobile phone connectivity. And so, sources told Mail Today, the SSP and other police officials were tasked to communicate “important information” about the chief secretary’s “personal needs” using the walkie-talkies — which are official resources. The whims and fancies of the top bureaucrat and his family members were put across to the concerned people outside the Reserve so that the ‘demands’ were met with alacrity. The chief secretary and his family members, administrative sources told Mail Today, had a relaxed time at the VVIP guest house. But even as he “admired the beauty and biodiversity of the Reserve”, Ranjan took some time off on Friday to distribute the ‘Samajwadi Party Pension Scheme’ pass books and 1,593 cycles to labourers at a programme organised by the district administration. It was Christmas after all and all-powerful Ranjan wanted to share a dash of happiness with the subaltern.","Chief secretary Alok Ranjan and family visit Pilibhit Tiger Reserve .

"He was a brutal tyrant whose regime of terror horrified the world. But when the Queen wrote to Ugandan dictator Idi Amin – just weeks before his atrocities began to be exposed – she signed off her letter with the line ‘Your Good Friend’. The extraordinary letter is revealed for the first time in previously unpublished papers from the National Archives. They also reveal how the Queen quickly changed her view of Amin, but maintained the semblance of diplomatic decorum because of fears for the lives of British citizens in the African country. Scroll down for video . Amin, a former British Colonial Army officer who seized power in a 1971 coup, was left giddy with excitement after receiving a Christmas card from the Foreign Office. He sent a gushing letter in January 1972 inviting the Queen to the tenth anniversary of Ugandan independence that October, writing: ‘It would do my government a great honour if Your Majesty could grace these celebrations with your presence in the company of your husband and the rest of your family.’ The Queen politely declined, stating: ‘I am most disappointed that my commitments at that time will prevent my accepting your invitation.’ She concluded with her customary sign-off to heads of state: ‘I am your good friend, Elizabeth R.’ Later that year Amin expelled Uganda’s large community of Asians, including many thousands of British passport-holders, and news of widespread atrocities under his rule began to circulate. As a result, the Queen was reluctant to send a proposed message to Uganda for Independence Day. During his nine-year rule of Uganda, Idi Amin murdered an estimated 500,000 people and expelled thousands of Asians from the African nation . Dear Mr President, . Thank you for your message of 10th January, delivered by your Minister of Defence. I reciprocate your good wishes and read with pleasure what you said about relations between our countries. I am very grateful for you asking me to attend the celebrations of the Tenth Anniversary of Ugandan Independence on 9th October, 1972. I am most disappointed that my commitments at that time will prevent my accepting your invitation. I take this opportunity of wishing all success to your celebrations and to Uganda and its people throughout 1972. I am your good friend, . Elizabeth R. She relented only when Foreign Office staff warned Buckingham Palace that British lives could be at risk if Amin felt he was being snubbed. Following the advice, a very short message was sent expressing the Queen’s good wishes to the people of Uganda – with no mention of Amin. During his nine-year rule, the tyrant murdered an estimated 500,000 people. He was finally ousted in April 1979 and fled to Libya. He died in 2003.","The Queen signed off a letter to Idi Amin with the line 'Your Good Friend'

"Esther Rantzen, who is set to be made a Dame in the New Year's Honours List for her charity and campaigning work . She’s the legendary star of That’s Life! who went on to found ChildLine for abused children and The Silver Line charity for lonely pensioners. And now The Mail on Sunday can reveal that Esther Rantzen is to achieve the ultimate recognition for her tireless campaigning – by being made a Dame in the New Year Honours. Among the other honours is a knighthood for veteran actor John Hurt, 74, marking a glittering stage and film career that has spanned more than 50 years. ChildLine was established after Ms Rantzen, 74, highlighted the problems of child abuse in 1986 on her BBC show That’s Life! The programme was swamped with calls from the public who said they had been treated cruelly as children. It led to the creation of the charity which was deluged with 50,000 calls on its first day. The charity, of which Ms Rantzen is president, is now merged with the NSPCC and has 11 bases in the UK. The idea has been copied in 150 countries. Her work led to her being raised to Commander of the British Empire (CBE) for services to children in 2006. She had already been awarded the OBE in 1991. In 2012, Ms Rantzen spoke of her regret at not paying more attention to rumours about the paedophile crimes of DJ Jimmy Savile. She admitted: ‘We all blocked our ears to the gossip. I felt to blame. I felt Jim had persuaded us all, audiences, fans, television professionals, even the Pope, to create a myth around Saintly Jim so that he became untouchable. He deceived all of us.’ Two years ago, Ms Rantzen set up The Silver Line, a ‘ChildLine for older people’, after describing her own loneliness following the death of her husband, film-maker Desmond Wilcox. For the first time she found herself living on her own and was not prepared for how hard it would be. Two Pints of Lager actress: Sheridan Smith, star of ITV series Cilla, will reportedly receive an OBE . Actor John Hurt, who has had a career spanning more than 50 years, is also set to receive a knighthood . She wrote of her dread of coming back to an empty flat, of spending evenings alone on the sofa and waking at midnight, still on the sofa, with the TV blaring and ‘my head heavy and aching, and having to force myself to my empty bed’. Also said to be among those set for an honour is Sheridan Smith, star of ITV series Cilla - and Two Pints of Lager and a Packet of Crisps. The Sun On Sunday reports she will receive an OBE. The knighthood for John Hurt is in recognition of his work in more than 150 films. Hurt – also known for his hellraising antics in the 1970s as a drinking pal of fellow actors Peter O’Toole, Oliver Reed and Richard Harris – has played a wide range of roles from Harry Potter’s wandmaker Mr Ollivander to gay civil servant Quentin Crisp in The Naked Civil Servant, and John Merrick in The Elephant Man, which involved spending up to 12 hours a day in the make-up department. Joan Collins, left, is also set to be made a Dame, while James Corden, right, is set to receive an OBE . He has won two Oscars, a Golden Globe and four Baftas, but often downplays his talent, saying he is ‘just a character actor really’. Comic actor James Corden, 36, who played Smithy in Gavin & Stacey, is to receive an OBE. The honour is in recognition of his services to entertainment and charity. And Joan Collins, 81, who played Alexis Carrington in 1980s soap Dynasty, is expected to become a Dame. She made her stage debut aged nine and went to Hollywood in her 20s, later starring in raunchy movies based on her sister Jackie’s novels The Stud and The Bitch. Five-times-married Collins, 81, is now settled with theatre producer Percy Gibson, 49. Asked about their age gap, she once joked: ‘If he dies, he dies!’","Esther Rantzen is to be made a Dame in the New Year's Honours List .

"The world's first hybrid plane that can recharged itself mid flight has been successfully tested, it has been reported. The aircraft has been created by a team at Cambridge University, working with Boeing, who carried out the maiden flight at Sywell Aerodrome, in Northampton. But passengers won't be boarding a hybrid plane any time soon, as a jetline would only be able to stay airborne for a matter of minutes. The demonstration aircraft is powered by parallel hybrid-electric propulsion system and is said to use 30 per cent less fuel than petrol only planes, Cambridge University said. The world's first hybrid plane, created by a team at Cambridge University, working with Boeing, has successfully been tested . The hybrid plane is said to use 30 per cent less fuel than petrol only planes . The aircraft, which is based on a commercially available singe seater, is also able to recharge its batteries in flight. Based on a commercially available single seater, the aircraft is also able to recharge its batteries in flight. During the tests the plane performed a series of 'hops' along the runway, before a flight at over 1,500 feet. The plane, whose hybrid engine was designed and built by engineers at Cambridge with Boeing funding support, works by the same principle as a hybrid car. During take off, when it needs most power, it uses both the petrol engine and the electric motor, but once cruising height is reached the electric motor can be switched onto generator mode. This will then recharge the batteries or it can be switched to motor assist mode to save fuel. 'Although hybrid cars have been available for more than a decade, what's been holding back the development of hybrid or fully-electric aircraft until now is battery technology,' said Dr Paul Robertson of Cambridge's Department of Engineering, who led the project. 'Until recently, they have been too heavy and didn't have enough energy capacity. But with the advent of improved lithium-polymer batteries, similar to what you'd find in a laptop computer, hybrid aircraft – albeit at a small scale – are now starting to become viable.' Dr Robertson said that while this is an is an important step in the development of hybrid or fully-electric aircraft, more research is required before commercial airliners will be powered entirely with electric motors. Currently if all the engines and all the fuel in a modern aircraft were replaced by batteries, it would have a total flying time of roughly ten minutes.","Cambridge University has tested the world's first hybrid plane in the UK .

"Domestic abusers are using secret apps hidden on their partner's phones and computers to keep track of what they are doing. The technology turns a smart phone into a high-tech spying device allowing remote access to the handset. The attackers are able to keep track of the phone owner's current location. The abuser is also able to remotely switch on the phone's microphone and listen in to anything within earshot of the handset. A Danish citizen was last month fined  $500,000 by federal judges in the United States after he admitted advertising and selling his StealthGenie spyware app. Scroll down for video . Spyware users can easily  log onto the internet and monitor the victim's phone without their knowledge . However, a British company is currently marketing its own spyware app for £30 which works on Android phones. The software, which cannot be detected by the casual user, turns the average smartphone into a powerful surveillance platform. A survey by Women's Aid discovered that 41 per cent of domestic violence victims had been subjected to some form of illicit electronic surveillance. Some abusive spouses will even install spyware software on Christmas presents for their children to find out what was happening inside their victim's phone. Polly Neate, chief executive of Women's Aid told The Independent: 'Domestic abuse is about control and perpetrators will use any means available to maintain and increase their control. 'We increasingly hear stories of abusers adding tracking software to phones, placing spyware on personal computers and using the internet to gather information on their partner. 'However, in many cases the police are not trained to recognise and understand the impact of online abuse, including tracking, and action is rarely taken against the abusers.' The FBI busted one of the biggest spyware operators following a raid in Los Angeles in September. The bureau arrested Hammad Akbar, chief executive of InvoCode Pvt, who developed and sold the StealthGenie app. Assistant Attorney General Leslie Caldwell of the US Justice Department said: 'Spyware is an electronic eavesdropping tool that secretly and illegally invades individual privacy.' Hammad Akbar, pictured, was fined $500,000 after he admitted selling a spyware software application . StealthGenie was available across the globe and claimed people could spy on a phone in just five minutes . Leslie Caldwell, assistant attorney general of the Justice Department's Criminal Division said: 'Selling spyware is not just reprehensible, it's a crime. 'Apps like StealthGenie are expressly designed for use by stalkers and domestic abusers who want to know every detail of a victim's personal life – all without the victim's knowledge. The Criminal Division is committed to cracking down on those who seek to profit from technology designed and used to commit brazen invasions of individual privacy.' 'StealthGenie has little use beyond invading a victim's privacy' said U.S. Attorney Boente. 'Advertising and selling spyware technology is a criminal offense, and such conduct will be aggressively pursued by this office and our law enforcement partners.' According to the Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3): ' The purchaser can review information transferred from the target mobile phone via an online portal. These intercepted communications are stored on the StealthGenie website. For example, a purchaser can log-in to the online portal to access information pulled from the user's phone such as messages, e-mail, photos, and phone calls. 'Mobile device spyware apps are developed and advertised as being invisible to targets and act in an undetectable manner. For example, an app can be installed to look like another type of app or file, such as a digital photo application.

"Two fire chiefs and two poultry farm bosses have been convicted and sentenced to prison terms of up to nine years for a fire at a plant in northeastern China last year that killed 121 people. The June 2013 fire in Jilin province was China's deadliest industrial accident in five years and highlighted continuing violations of safety regulations despite recent improvements in the country's work safety record. Survivors at the time described workers, mostly women, struggling through smoke and flames in the poultry processing plant to reach doors that turned out to be locked or blocked after an electrical short ignited flammable goods. Firefighters pictured carrying body bags, one after another, from the charred wreckage of the factory . About 100 workers managed to escape the deadly smoke and flames. Those who survived said all the lights went out, the plant went dark and people started to panic . Rescue services were pulling bodies from the remains of the charred building (pictured) six hours after the fire broke out. Two fire chiefs have now been jailed for abuse of power after they falsified information . On Friday, two district courts in Changchun city sentenced two bosses of the plant and two fire officials, the official Xinhua News Agency said. The chairman of Jilin Baoyuanfeng Poultry Company, Jia Yushan, was sentenced to nine years in prison and fined 1 million yuan (£102,000) for not ensuring the working environment was safe, and former general manager Zhang Yushen was sentenced to four years for installing substandard equipment, Xinhua said. Lyu Yandong, the former chief of the local fire department, and his deputy Liu Guicai were convicted of abuse of power and sentenced to prison terms of up to 5 and a half years. Prosecutors previously said they had failed to carry out any serious inspections of the plant and falsified information after the fire to try and cover that up. While 121 people were killed in the deadly blaze, another 76 were badly injured. At the time the company was producing 67,000 tonnes of processed chicken per year and employed about 1,200 people.

Alarmingly, there were numerous reports of survivors saying they struggled to get out of the building because exits were 'blocked'. They said because of the 'complicated' design of the building, including narrow corridors, blocked exits and lights cutting out, many were unable to escape. Reports at the time claimed workers heard a loud explosion and then dark smoke and flames quickly engulfed the factory. Speaking to Chinese state media CCTV, one woman said: 'I heard a huge blast, I thought it was an earthquake, everyone started running. I fell and and had to crawl out of the building.' Relatives are overcome with grief as the poultry plant smoulders in the background . Survivors and relatives watch on in horror at the scene of the fire, praying their loved ones are safe . Another escaped by climbing out of the window. She said: 'A huge cloud of black smoke came down the corridor. It was burning hot; it engulfed me.' She collapsed unconscious as soon as she was outside. Wang Fenya, a 44-year-old female worker said: 'Soon after (the fire started) someone shouted ""run away!"" and we quickly ran to the exit, which is about 40metres away from my seat. Suddenly the lights went out and the plant got quite dark.' She said when she finally got outside and looked back, she could see big flames coming out of the building.","The Chinese factory fire killed 121 workers and badly injured another 76 .

"A leader of the notorious Islamic extremist group al-Shabab has given himself up in Somalia, according to intelligence officials. Zakariya Ismail Ahmed Hersi, who had a $3million bounty attached to him by the U.S. in 2012 for his capture, surrendered to Somali police in the Gedo region. A Somali intelligence officer, who insisted on remaining anonymous, said Hersi may have surrendered because he fell out with those loyal to Ahmed Abdi Godane, al-Shabab's top leader. Zakariya Ismail Ahmed Hersi, a leader with the Islamic extremist group al-Shabab who has a $3 million bounty on his head, has surrendered to police in Somalia. File picture of al-Shabab militants in training . Godane was killed in a U.S. airstrike earlier this year, the officer said, and Hersi has been on the run ever since. Hersi was one of seven top al-Shabab officials whom the Obama administration offered a total $33 million in rewards for information leading to their capture in 2012. It is not clear if the reward will be paid out for Hersi because he surrendered. Regional military official, Jama Muse, told Al Jazeera: 'Zakariya Ahmed was a very senior person who worked with Godane. 'He was in charge of intelligence and finances. He was one of the senior al-Shabab commanders who the Americans put a lot of money on their head,' he added. But, a spokesman from al-Shabab told the broadcaster that Hersi left the group two years ago and surrendered to the Somali government. The spokesman also said that when he was a mid-level commander within the group and not an intelligence chief, as claimed by Somali officials.. Meanwhile another Somali military official, Mohamed Osmail, said Hersi was hiding in a house in a border town and made contact with government officials in order to hand himself in. Four al-Shabab militants were captured during a raid on an African Union military compound, which also houses the British Embassy, on Christmas Day . Despite major setbacks in 2014, al-Shabab remains a threat in Somalia and the East African region. The group has carried out many terror attacks in Somalia and some in neighboring countries including Kenya, whose armies are part of the African Union troops bolstering Somalia's weak U.N.- backed government. On Christmas Day, al-Shabab launched an attack at the African Union base in Mogadishu. Nine people died, including three African Union soldiers, in the attack on the complex, which also houses U.N. offices and western embassies. Al-Shabab said the attack was aimed at a Christmas party and was in retaliation for the killing of the group's leader Godane. The extremist group also claimed that 14 soldiers were killed but it is thought the militants often exaggerates the number of people they kill.

Al-Shabab is waging an Islamic insurgency against Somalia's government that is attempting to rebuild the country after decades of conflict. The group controlled much of Mogadishu during the years 2007 to 2011, but was pushed out of Somalia's capital and other major cities by African Union forces. The United States and the U.N. warn that political infighting in Somalia is putting at risk the security gains. The federal government remains weak and wields little power outside the capital Mogadishu.","Zakariya Ismail Ahmed Hersi reportedly surrendered to police in Somalia .

"The woman who was raped by footballer Ched Evans has been forced to change her name and move for a fifth time after being hunted down by vile internet trolls. Speaking on condition that The Mail on Sunday does not reveal her location, the victim’s father said malicious individuals continue to hunt down his daughter, and she was forced to relocate before Christmas. The father spoke out after complaining to the Attorney General Jeremy Wright that CCTV footage on Evans’s official website showing his daughter entering a hotel shortly before the rape could be in contempt of court. Fury: Victim's father watches Ched Evans protest his innocence sat alongside girlfriend Natasha Massey . However, he did not receive a reply to his original complaint last month. It was only when The Mail on Sunday intervened and contacted the Attorney General that his office said it was now ‘seriously considering’ the issues. The 23-year-old woman, who has a lifelong right to anonymity as the victim of a sexual assault, has been living in hiding at locations around Britain since her identity was revealed on the internet three years ago. Separated from her family and friends, she has been able to meet her father only once in that time and communicates mainly by phone. She was not even able to exchange Christmas presents with him. The Mail on Sunday can reveal that she was working over the Christmas period to take her mind off the ordeal as she continues to live in fear of Evans’s supporters, who are determined to discredit her and reveal her changes of name and address. Last night, the father said: ‘It’s the fifth time she’s had to move in under three years, she is just living her life on the run. ‘I couldn’t even see her over Christmas because it’s too risky for her to visit me. I don’t even know where she is living at the moment, so I haven’t been able to give her the Christmas presents I bought her.’ Former Sheffield United footballer Evans, 26, was jailed for five years in April 2012 for raping the then 19-year-old waitress, who was judged to be too drunk to have given her consent to sex. Despite having the right to anonymity following the jury’s unanimous verdict, her name was tweeted by Evans’s supporters and then re-tweeted 6,000 times. Evans’s official website continues to protest his innocence despite his conviction. In a poignant statement, the victim’s father said: ‘The last time I saw her was almost a year ago, and it’s been hard not having her at home over Christmas. I just want her near me so I can protect her. ‘I don’t think the police are doing their job if she’s having to move five times in under three years. ‘Ched Evans is able to lead a normal life. He has never apologised to my daughter. Instead, his website proclaims his innocence and draws attention to my daughter every day that it remains posted on the net. I think it should be taken down.’ Evans, 26, has never shown any remorse and has referred to the rape in a hotel bedroom as ‘an act of infidelity’ against his fiancee Natasha Massey, 26. The attack in May 2011 came after Evans and another footballer, Clayton McDonald, also 26, had been out in Rhyl, North Wales. McDonald, who was cleared of rape, had sex with the girl in a Premier Inn. When he left the hotel, Evans had sex with her and claimed it was consensual. He was released in October having served half his sentence. The victim’s father added: ‘It’s a disgrace. I heard nothing from the Attorney General’s office until they were contacted by The Mail on Sunday. ‘She is on trial every day thanks to Evans’s website. It shows her entering the Premier Inn with the headline “Judge for yourself”. Only her face is blurred and, in my view, she is easily recognisable. Neither the Crown Prosecution Service nor Premier Inn gave permission for the footage to be used. ‘It can’t be right for a rape victim, after having endured the horrendous ordeal of a trial, to be subjected to “trial by website”.’ Yesterday, a spokeswoman for the Attorney General’s office said: ‘One of our senior lawyers has been seriously considering the number of issues raised in the letter since we received it on November 12 and we hope to reach a conclusion shortly. ‘We apologise that the victim’s father has not been kept updated and we will be in touch with him as soon as possible.’ Shamed: Ched Evans in action for Sheffield United in 2012 .","Victim's father said she was forced to relocate before Christmas .

"He's still best known to millions as the anarchic punk Vyvyan in the hit 1980s sitcom The Young Ones. But actor Ade Edmondson’s latest choice of role couldn’t be further from a student with spiky hair and a string of metal stars stuck across his forehead – he’s about to play an aristocrat in a new BBC adaptation of Tolstoy’s epic War And Peace. The 1869 story of love and betrayal is set against the backdrop of Napoleon’s invasion of Russia, and follows the fortunes of five aristocratic families over the course of the conflict that ravages Europe. Edmondson, 56, will play tragic Count Ilya Rostov, who squanders the inheritance of his four children. Lily James – Downton Abbey’s Lady Rose – has landed the part of Rostov’s beautiful daughter Natasha, a role played by Audrey Hepburn in a 1956 Hollywood version. Ade Edmondson, who played a spiky-haired student in The Young Ones, will take the role of an aristocrat in a BBC adaptation of War and Peace. His daughter will be played by Lily James - Lady Rose in Downton Abbey . White Mischief star Greta Scacchi will play Rostov’s imperious wife Natalya, and rising star James Norton, who portrayed a rapist in the BBC1 drama Happy Valley, is dashing Prince Andrei Bolkonsky, one of the two principal male characters in the novel. American star Paul Dano, recently seen as a brutal plantation carpenter in Oscar-winning film 12 Years A Slave, will take on the pivotal male role of Pierre Bezhukov, a misfit whose social and economic prospects are transformed when he inherits a family fortune. The adaptation is by Bafta-winning scriptwriter Andrew Davies, whose previous acclaimed work for the Corporation includes Pride And Prejudice and Bleak House. Last night Davies admitted that he had read the novel for the first time only relatively recently. He said: ‘I was struck by how fresh and modern the characters and relationships felt. It’s a story of the hopes and dreams of youth. We get love, friendship, huge swings of fortune, betrayals, tragedy and a surprising amount of comedy.’ Lily James, pictured as Lady Rose in Downton Abbey, will play the role of Natasha, the daughter of Count Ilya Rostov, in War and Peace . The drama is one of the most ambitious projects mounted by the BBC in recent years. Filming begins next month and scenes are to be shot on location in Russia, Lithuania and Latvia. War And Peace will be screened in six one-hour episodes on BBC1 at the end of next year. Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein, who is producing the series with the BBC, said: ‘Putting an epic, iconic story like War And Peace on screen is an incredible thrill. Lily, Paul and James are all amazing actors.’ Davies’s adaptation is not the only forthcoming production of War And Peace. On New Year’s Day, Radio 4 is presenting a ten-hour version with a cast including John Hurt Lesley Manville and Simon Russell Beale.","Ex-Young Ones star Ade Edmondson will play aristocrat in War and Peace .

"Steve Ross claims that when his father shot his mother in the neck this Christmas season, it was a 'blessing on two fronts.' That's because when his mom, 75-year-old Charlene Ross, arrived at an Akron hospital following the accidental shooting, she discovered she had an undiagnosed heart condition. Steve's 77-year-old father, Boyd Ross, told police a shotgun went off Sunday in his son's home in York Township as the man was checking to see if it was loaded. Birdshot: Steve Ross, pictured, holds up a pellet of birdshot that accidentally hit his 75-year-old mother Charlene Ross in the neck, which led doctors to discover an undiagnosed heart condition . The Medina Gazette reports that the Stevens Model 320 12-gauge was loaded with 'birdshot' and fired through a closet wall into the back of the chair where his wife was sitting. Boyd was planning to take the shotgun out from the closet to scare geese away from a pond on the property. One pellet ripped through the armchair and grazed the woman on the neck, leaving a 4-inch cut, Steve said. The other pellets stayed lodged in the chair. After she was airlifted to Akron City Hospital, medical staff found she suffered from arrhythmia, or irregular heartbeat, that had gone unnoticed because she hadn't seen a doctor for several years. 'My father had said she hasn’t been feeling well and it turns out that she has been having arrhythmia attacks,' Steve said. A pacemaker was implanted Friday afternoon and Steve said later that his mother was 'up and running around.' 'Had this accident not happened, my mom could have been gone at any time,' he said. 'You hate to use cliches, but this is a Christmas miracle.' Still, Steve said he nurses a slight twinge of guilt over the accident, since he was the last to use the gun and his father normally keeps it unloaded. 'I’ve been battling with this aspect because in a way it is my fault,' he said. “I should have unloaded it before he arrived at the house.' The Medina County Sheriff's Office said it was investigating the shooting as an accident.","Charlene Ross, 75, was shot in the neck by her 77-year-old husband Boyd .

"Star attraction: In the autumn, Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt completed filming their romantic drama By The Sea on the nine-by-four-mile island of Gozo . Now that Christmas is over, the annual assault from the holiday companies has begun, with firms urging us to book our summer vacations. One of the destinations being advertised is Gozo, Malta’s picturesque smaller sister. But Gozo is not just good for a holiday rental – it is worth buying there too, especially because of the limelight that will shine upon it in the coming year. In the autumn, Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt completed filming their romantic drama By The Sea on the nine-by-four-mile island. It is scheduled for release in 2015. The couple, who married on August 23, seemed to treat filming as a mix of a belated honeymoon and work. Much of this filming took place on one of Gozo’s favourite secluded beaches – Mgarr ix-Xini, which was closed to the public for three months while the production team took it over. They also filmed in the square in the village of Gharb. ‘It’s been very good for Gozo having Brad and Angelina here,’ says Marie Grech, manager of estate agent Frank Salt’s Gozo office. ‘It has raised the island’s profile and increased the number of people visiting while they were filming. Hopefully, some of these people will return.’ Although small – the island has only 37,000 residents, known as Gozitans – Gozo has 13 villages and two seaside holiday areas. The capital, Victoria, has two opera houses and a magnificent citadel built on raised ground. There is no airstrip on the island so visitors arrive by ferry from Malta. Homes there are remarkably good value. ‘Properties on Gozo are ten per cent to 20 per cent cheaper than on Malta, with some enjoying marvellous views of the Gozitan countryside and the Mediterranean blue seas,’ says John Abela of Gozo Prime (gozoprime.com). ‘It is much greener – and life is so much more laid-back – than in Malta. Gozo is also much safer.’ Jane Purvis, 61, bought a new farmhouse in 2009. Her late husband, Malcolm, discovered and fell in love with Gozo when he was sailing in the Mediterranean as a 21-year-old. ‘When we married 33 years ago, he promised me he’d take me there, although it was a while before he did,’ says Jane. ‘I loved it too and for 11 years we went there regularly, staying in the same hotel every time. Picturesque: Gozo has lots of fantastic restaurants, amazing food and wine, and it’s not expensive . 'We decided we were going so often that it would make more sense to buy a house and nine years ago bought a “shell” in the village of Xaghra. The builder finished the house for us in under six months and after January 2005 we used it often.’ Sadly, Malcolm died earlier this year, which is why Jane is very reluctantly selling up. ‘The more you go, the more you love it,’ she says. ‘Gozo has the most fantastic charm. It’s so tranquil, although some parts, such as Marsalforn, are pretty buzzy in the summer. There are lots of fantastic restaurants, amazing food and wine, and it’s not expensive.’ Her three-bedroom house, which has been built in rustic style, is fully furnished, with air-conditioning, a pool, lovely views of country and sea, and is for sale for €645,000 (£506,000) through Frank Salt. Relatively cheap: Homes there are remarkably good value. Most property is built from local limestone. Ceilings are high and the older properties have traditional arches, wooden beams, beautifully patterned tiled floors and interior courtyards . Most property is built from local limestone. Ceilings are high and the older properties have traditional arches, wooden beams, beautifully patterned tiled floors and interior courtyards. You can buy a furnished two-bedroom apartment in the village of Xlendi for €105,000 (£82,000, franksalt.com.mt) or a new two-bedroom apartment in the village of Qala for €151,400 (£119,000, gozohomes.com). A furnished two-bedroom farmhouse with garden and terraces in Mgarr ix-Xini will cost you €215,000 (£169,000, gozoprime.com) or, at the top end of the scale, a farmhouse in Gharb with two bedrooms, a large living and dining room and a landscaped terraced, garden and pool could be yours for €1.175 million (£923,000, franksalt.com.mt). There are also many old properties, ripe for conversion. Set to boom: Gozo is not just good for a holiday rental – it is worth buying there too, especially because of the limelight that will shine upon it in the coming year . One feature of Gozo is its 46 churches, with the largest in the oldest village, Xewkija. Its dome is the third-largest unsupported one in Europe, after St Peter’s in Rome and St Paul’s in London. There’s only one large sandy beach, Ramla, on the island, with the majority being small, rocky coves tucked away down long, winding paths – some with cafes, most without. All have crystal-clear sea, which is warm from May to Christmas. ‘People like Gozo because it has a healthy lifestyle, it takes only a maximum of 15 minutes to get to a beach or Victoria, and it’s easy to integrate into village community,’ says Marie. ‘The government has been putting a lot of money into improving the roads, restoring all the old churches and citadel and enlarging the hospital, which is good for both residents and visitors.’","Island, north of Malta, is just nine-by-four-miles with a population of 37,000 .
