"(CNN) -- It took more than 20 years to get an answer for the injustices I suffered as an unfairly paid worker, so I know what it's like to wait. But the six seconds of silence from Mitt Romney's campaign recently seemed like forever. Romney's advisers held a conference call inviting reporters to ask questions. One was simple and straightforward: ""Does Gov. Romney support the Lilly Ledbetter Act?"" In other words, when a woman is paid less than a man for doing the same work, does the presumptive Republican nominee support her right to fight for the equal pay she's guaranteed under the law? That's exactly what the bill that bears my name ensures -- it simply gives workers a fair shot to make their case in court. It's not a hypothetical question. Women get paid just 77 cents for every dollar a man gets. That means a woman would have had to work from January 1, 2011, until this Tuesday to match what men earned in 2011 alone. Romney's team has certainly had enough time to think about its candidate's positions -- he's been running for president for six years -- and about the law in question, which was the very first one that Barack Obama signed as president more than three years ago. But Romney's team drew a blank. The line went silent. Crickets. When an adviser finally piped up, it wasn't to answer the question. It was to tell the reporter, ""We'll get back to you on that."" The Republican nominee for president doesn't know whether he supports the principle of equal pay for an equal day's work? He needs some time to think about it? What an insult. Romney then went on national television, where Diane Sawyer asked him if he would have signed the bill into law. He still wouldn't give a straight answer, saying that he had no ""intention of changing that law."" In other words, he ducked the question. For all we know, had the Ledbetter bill crossed Romney's desk instead of President Obama's, Romney would have vetoed womens' right to fight back. And if a future Republican Congress tries to repeal the Ledbetter law, we don't know whether Romney would let it. If the Paycheck Fairness Act, which goes even further to outlaw gender discrimination in the workplace, reached his desk, we don't know whether he would stop it. While Romney decides whether he opposes gender discrimination, here is an important reality he should consider: This isn't just about women. It's about all families and their economic security. The consequences of unequal pay reach far beyond the paychecks women take home every week. My pension and Social Security were based on an unfair salary, so over the course of my career, I was cheated out of hundreds of thousands of dollars that could have gone to my kids' education or my family's medical bills or to support the shops and small businesses in my community. I also worked countless hours of overtime, but the extra pay I earned was based on the same uneven scale. The question Romney's campaign couldn't answer is a question of fairness and whether American workers have a level playing field on which everyone has the same opportunity to get ahead. I know Obama believes in those values. As the grandson of a woman who worked in a bank long after she hit the glass ceiling -- and who was paid less than the men she trained -- he believes equal pay is an essential right. As the father of two girls, he cares deeply about making sure the work force they'll join one day isn't slanted against them. But I have no idea where Romney stands -- and from the sound of it, neither do those closest to him. What we do know about whom and what Romney supports is even more unsettling than his silence on this issue. Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker recently took away citizens' rights to fight workplace discrimination. Romney called him a ""hero"" and a ""man of courage."" He'd also repeal Obama's health reforms and bring back the discriminatory days when being a woman was considered a pre-existing condition, which means insurance companies could charge us more than men for the same coverage or deny it to us altogether. When combined with pay inequality, Romney's promises would mean women would earn less income and then be forced to pay more for basic health care. That's devastating for our families and the economic security of the middle class. Anyone who wants to be president of the United States shouldn't have to think about whether hardworking, responsible middle-class families deserve the opportunity to succeed. We know all too well what it's like to hear silence when we fight for fairness -- and we've heard enough. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Lilly Ledbetter.","Mitt Romney's campaign drew a blank when asked if it supports the Lilly Ledbetter Act .

She says pay equality is not just about fairness, it's about economic security for all families .

"MIAMI, Florida (CNN) -- A federal judge on Tuesday approved the extradition of former Panamanian dictator Manuel Noriega to France, where he faces a 10-year sentence on a conviction in absentia on money-laundering charges. Manuel Noriega, in a 1989 file photo, leaves his headquarters in Panama City, Panama. Magistrate William Turnoff agreed with the government's case for extraditing Noriega to France and issued a ""certificate of extradability."" Noriega's lawyer, Frank Rubino, said he would continue to fight the extradition. He had said Noriega hoped to return to Panama to be closer to his family. The issue has emerged because Noriega is scheduled to complete his Florida prison term on September 9. The former Panamanian strongman was captured in the 1989 U.S. military invasion of Panama and was convicted in 1992 of racketeering for accepting bribes to allow drugs to be shipped through Panama destined for the United States. His attorneys had argued that his status as a prisoner of war meant he should be returned to Panama, but a separate court ruling last Friday rejected that argument. ""This court never intended for the proclamation of defendant as a POW to shield him from all future prosecutions for serious crimes he is alleged to have committed,"" Senior U.S. District Judge William Hoeveler wrote in Friday's 12-page opinion. ""It appears that the extradition proceedings should proceed uninterrupted."" Hoeveler noted that Noriega ""has not always sought repatriation,"" and had, at one time, asked to be allowed to go to a third country. Noriega also faces possible prison time in Panama, where he is accused of kidnapping, extortion and the murder of political opponents. Though the charges are more serious, if the 69-year-old Noriega is convicted of murder, he would likely serve much of his sentence under home detention in Panama. Panamanian law provides home detention for anyone 74 years old or older. The Panamanian constitution would also forbid his extradition to France. Next month, Noriega will have served nearly 17Â½ years of an original 40-year sentence in the United States. The sentence was later reduced to 30 years, and further shortened for good behavior.

"(CNN) -- At first glance, Sergei Baltacha doesn't exactly look like a man of international sporting history. Tall, slim and stylishly dressed, the 56-year-old appears to have more in common with a graphic designer or university professor than a globally renowned footballer. But make no mistake -- this is a man who has represented the USSR at a World Cup and a European Championships before breaking through football's Iron Curtain to become the first player from the Soviet Union to play for an English club. Baltacha, who hails from Ukraine (then part of the USSR and currently a country in political and social turmoil), was a cultured, yet physically tough defender and sweeper who made 300 appearances for Dynamo Kiev and earned 49 caps for the Soviet Union. He eventually brought his steely Soviet style to English league side Ipswich Town, blazing a trail for the likes of Georgi Kinkladze, Dmitri Kharine and Andrei Arshavin in the process. ""It was interesting because it was 1988 and at that time it started to be the history of Gorbachov,"" of glasnost and perestroika, Baltacha said of the circumstances that surrounded his signing for The Tractor Boys in 1988. There was interest from ""some Italian clubs, some from Switzerland (but) first time when I heard about Ipswich I wouldn't choose any other team because for me English football is everything."" ""I left everything that we have over there (in the USSR). When we got all the papers, passports, we flew and we started for two years to live here."" Pitching up near the Norfolk coast was a far cry from the regimented footballing education Baltacha received back home, however. Strategy and attitudes to sport were far more sophisticated in his homeland than in England where a hard-drinking culture was still prevalent amongst players at many leading football clubs. Early days . Baltacha had learned at the feet of Valeriy Lobanovskyi after all, a Dynamo Kiev hero and one of the most vaunted footballing coaches of the 20th century. Lobanovskyi was famed for his scientific focus on conditioning and no little tactical nous. He was also one of the first coaches to harness the power of computer technology to track performance levels and simulate game scenarios. Athletic and intelligent, the young Baltacha had the raw materials to succeed in the rigorous Lobanovskyi program. He was spotted by the Dynamo boss while still a teenager at the Kharkiv academy of footballing excellence which he had left home to attend at the age of 13. By 1976 an offer to turn professional was on the table from Kiev. Dynamo had won the European Cup Winners' Cup one year previously, becoming the first club side from the USSR to lift a major continental trophy. The decision to accept was not a difficult one. ""I joined Dynamo Kiev and it was huge club, huge competition, and you play each game in front of 100,000 people. It's something special,"" Baltacha said of his time in the Ukrainian capital. ""Kiev was one of the best in Europe from the content of coaching, from facilities, its a premier ground, the analysis, the background of teams."" ""Even when I came (to England) after I played for Dynamo twelve years (later), the clubs did not do that kind of work that we had at Kiev."" This meticulous approach was something that would filter its way into the USSR national team after Lobonovskyi took charge for two spells during the 1980s. ""Dynamo Kiev was the best side in Russia at the time. (We had) maybe 12, 14 or 15 or sometimes even 17 people who represented national team,"" Baltacha said. ""But (we would) still be very friendly with other players from other clubs. We had unity which I think maybe was a strength of ours. (We were) like brothers and it really helped us."" International stage . This promising group of players would go on to star at the 1980 Olympics in Moscow, the 1982 World Cup in Spain and the European Championships in Germany six years later. The Soviets would reach the final of Euro 88 where they would lose to a Marco van Basten inspired Holland. For football geeks, the game played at Munich's Olympic Stadium represented a heavyweight clash of footballing philosophies -- the scientific approach of Lobanovskyi against the ""total football"" ideals of Dutch manager Rinus Michels. Lobanovskyi's Soviet side had beaten Holland 1-0 in the group stages earlier in the tournament, but Michels would get his revenge in the final thanks to a goal from Ruud Gullit and a wonder volley from van Basten. Baltacha was injured for much of the tournament, however, and only managed to make an appearance in the final as a substitute after his side had gone 2-0 down. It is for this reason he holds fonder memories of the 1982 World Cup in Spain. Although the Soviets were knocked out in the second stage, Baltacha was a key player at the heart of the USSR defense. ""(The) World Cup in Spain was like dream come true for me,"" Baltacha said. ""I could not wait. I remember each game, like I could not sleep before game because you want to step up on football pitch."" ""You're going to bed like maybe ten o'clock in evening and you're thinking about game. You're focusing. You're thinking about what can be happening. You're thinking and you're so excited you look at clock and it's (already) three o'clock morning,"" he laughingly adds. Despite the Soviet's early exit, Baltacha regards the '82 World Cup as one of his proudest moments. He even scored a rare goal in the group stages against New Zealand. ""A lot of players will play in World Cup as forwards who never score and I was (a) center defender and I scored this goal. It's like a dream you know. This is the most memorable memory of all, it was fantastic."" Other favored memories of this tournament include playing against Brazilian legends of the game such as Socrates, Ãâ°der and Zico. ""I will never forget (that) game against Brazil when we played in against Ãâ°der and Zico. The two of them (scored) in the last ten minutes and we lost 2-1,"" he said. Foreign travels . Baltacha began his British sojourn following his final international appearance in 1988. After two seasons at Ipswich, he headed north of the border to Scotland, spending three years at St Johnstone before going on to manage Inverness Caledonian Thistle. Today, Baltacha spends his time coaching promising youngsters at English Championship side Charlton Athletic. Pitching up at such comparative footballing outposts was a far cry from his days at the pinnacle of European football but his family had settled in the UK. ""After ten years you realize kids grow up ... you realize you have your house here, your home here, your land here ... you are more than 15 years here and its how it happened?"" His son, Sergei Junior, was a promising footballer before injury curtailed his career. Daughter Elena, meanwhile, became a professional tennis player, reaching the number No. 1 ranking in Britain and breaking into the world's top 50. But tragedy struck earlier this year when she was diagnosed with liver cancer. Like her father, however, aggression in the face of adversity is a trait the now 30-year-old Elena has in spades. ""She was fighter during her days in sport and she is a fighter now,"" he said. ""I would like to say thanks to everyone who is support(ing) us, sending message, emails, calling us to give us support or offer any advice or you know."" ""Most importantly we are all together, fighting all together."" Sage words from a man who made a sporting career out of just such a philosophy. See also: Super Eagle who flew to the top .

"(CNN) -- It's been a while since we've heard anything concrete on Apple's rumored ""iWatch"" device, but Bloomberg now reports that Apple has filed on June 3 to trademark that name in Japan. This doesn't necessarily mean anything -- companies file for protective trademarks all the time -- but it's one more indication that Apple is dabbling in wearable computing. iWatch rumors have been flying for most of the year, but we still don't have a clear idea of what the gadget might look like (or what it would do) if it ever comes to market. One report said that the watch would run a version of iOS but suggested that battery life issues could be holding it back. The watch might also include a pedometer and other sensors to help it compete with fitness gadgets like Nike's FuelBand and the Fitbit. Apple CEO Tim Cook has previously said that ""amazing new hardware"" would be coming out this fall and throughout 2014, but whether he meant new product categories like an iWatch or simply refreshes of Apple's existing products (like the new Mac Pro) is anyone's guess. Either way, there's no need to worry if the iWatch doesn't pan out -- you can always rely on the Pebble watch or the rumored devices from Samsung, Google, or Microsoft to cover your unsightly naked wrists.

"Rome (CNN) -- A day before American Amanda Knox's appeal of her murder conviction resumes in an Italian appeals court, the sister of slaying victim Meredith Kercher vowed to keep fighting for justice on her behalf. ""Anyone reading this or following this case, please remember our beautiful Meredith,"" Stephanie Kercher said in a statement distributed Sunday by attorney Francesco Maresca. ""... Amongst the media frenzy that has developed throughout, Meredith has been forgotten because she is no longer with us, yet this should be about her and what really happened on that tragic evening."" Knox and her ex-boyfriend, Raffaele Sollecito, were convicted in the 2007 death of Kercher, 21. Kercher, a British exchange student, was found dead in the villa she and Knox rented in the central Italian university town of Perugia, seminaked and with her throat slashed. Knox was sentenced to 26 years in prison, Sollecito to 25. In July, the Italian appeals court heard testimony about new DNA analysis that may call Knox's conviction into question. The proceeding will resume Monday. At trial, authorities testified that a knife found in Sollecito's home had traces of Knox's genetic material on the handle and Kercher's in a tiny groove on the blade. DNA on Kercher's bra was also traced to Sollecito. Those results have been contested by two court-appointed forensic experts, professors Carla Vecchiotti and Stefano Conti. Vecchiotti testified in July that the knife tested negative for blood and the amount of DNA said to be Kercher's was so low, it could not be examined again with any conclusions. Vecchiotti and Conti also said there was no evidence the knife had been ""thoroughly washed,"" as prosecutors argued during the trial. Prosecutor Manuela Comodi questioned Vecchiotti regarding the standard sufficient quantity of DNA for valid testing, suggesting experts differ on the amount. Meanwhile, they said, the clasp from Kercher's bloodied bra, which allegedly contained Sollecito's DNA, was ""dirty"" and had been allowed to rust, making further testing futile. The evidence, the two argued, should be ""inadmissible."" ""Over the last week, we have waited anxiously and with great concern as the rumours surrounding the original DNA evidence findings are spreading,"" Stephanie Kercher said in the statement. It's difficult for Kercher's family to understand how the evidence, so carefully developed and presented at trial, could be deemed irrelevant, she said, and also to understand how a small amount could be useless when there is no determination of how much should be present. Knox's defense seems ""to focus and rely heavily on these two pieces of DNA evidence, but can we just remember for a moment what this case is actually about: my sister, a daughter brutally and selfishly taken from us nearing four years ago ... not a single day goes by that we can grasp any peace or closure."" She urged the public to remember the blood-splattered crime scene as well as 10,000 pages of evidence presented in the case. ""We still have confidence in the Perugia police and every faith in all those involved in court and the investigation,"" Stephanie Kercher said. Her family is asking that the appeals court assess each piece of evidence, ""both scientific and circumstantial, as well as any witnesses who have taken the stand independently of any other information or media."" The Kercher family has not forgotten Meredith, she said, ""and we will continue our fight for justice with the continued support of our lawyer Francesco Maresca and his team, the police and prosecution and all those involved in Italy as well as everyone all over the world who still thinks of us and Mez."" She said the family would like to work with the University in Perugia to offer a yearly place to a student in Meredith's name. ""Meredith loved Italy and its people and she wanted to immerse herself in the culture,"" her sister said. ""We are well aware of the impact this has had on the city and feel it would be an appropriate way of remembering Meredith in the beautiful place she left us to study. ""Please do not let Meredith die in vain,"" Stephanie Kercher said. ""Her courage and strength fight on and we will seek justice so she can rest in peace."" Her sister, she said, put up a fight for her life and did not give up, ""and we will not give up now."" A third defendant, small-time drug dealer Rudy Guede, an immigrant from the Ivory Coast, was also jailed in connection with Kercher's death. He was sentenced to 30 years for murder and sexual violence following a fast-track trial in 2008, but his sentence was later cut to 16 years.

"(CNN) -- While most college students are hooking up on the dance floor or checking each other out by scrolling through Facebook profile pictures, a small number of students are doing something really counter-cultural -- they're getting married before they graduate. Marrying as an undergrad is like putting a ""scarlet M on your forehead,"" said Bradford Wilcox, director of The Marriage Project, which studies marriages in America at the University of Virginia. ""In the 19th century, to commit adultery or premarital sex was sort of a big deal, whereas in college circles today, getting married is kind of the ultimate rebellion,"" he said. Peter Nesbitt, 20, proposed to Lane Ritchie, 19, in a park earlier this month. The third-year University of Michigan students have decided to get married in less than two months. The couple, who have dated since freshman year of high school, is more excited to spend the rest of their college days -- and lives -- together than worried about planning a backyard wedding that will be held after the first week of classes in September. As Nesbitt explained, there are many ""benefits"" to getting married while still in school. ""You're with your best friend all the time, so it's not like, oh my gosh, it's a ball and chain now,"" he joked. ""Yeah, college is stressful, but now you're getting to share it officially with someone else."" The average national age of marriage is 28, according to the National Center for Educational Statistics, and experts say planning a wedding while still taking finals and cheering at football games is going against the norm. Out of 20,928 undergraduates surveyed by the National Center for Education Statistics in 2008, about 18% reported they were married. While there are various reasons why college sweethearts decide to tie the knot, one thing is for sure: Married students face more challenges than they did in the past. It's financially more difficult for married students today than just five years ago, said Kelly Roberts, a marriage and family therapist and clinical instructor at Oklahoma State University. She cited the decreasing number of student loans available and married students taking on more jobs to cover expenses. ""Students are not just juggling one job to try to make ends meet, but they're juggling two,"" she said. The high cost of being a bridesmaid . Nesbitt and Ritchie are responsible for paying their own tuition. To cut down education costs, both are cramming in courses so they can graduate in less than four years. ""We're both excited just to have one job that we can focus on, rather than school and work,"" Ritchie said. For any couple, Roberts recommends waiting at least six months from the engagement announcement to the wedding, just so couples are certain they're making the right move. Andy and Brittany Hudson were engaged for 14 months, but Andy Hudson said he would have married his wife sooner if she wasn't finishing her master's at Southern Illinois University. ""You just find the person you love and want to spend the rest of your life with them,"" he said. But promising to take care of someone for better or worse might get in the way of a typical college experience. At Oklahoma State University, approximately 7% of the 18,541 undergraduates were married in 2010. Kami Schwerdtfeger, an OSU assistant professor of marriage and family therapy who counsels married students, said some of these students find adulthood, which can mean paying bills and keeping up a home, can ""butt heads"" with adolescence -- attending parties, staying out late with friends. Mark Regnerus, an associate professor of sociology at the University of Texas at Austin and author of ""Premarital Sex in America,"" explained that married college students are forced to ""grow up pretty quickly."" ""You have to mature and take on a new role,"" he said. ""It's not only your schoolwork that you're tending to, but it's also tending to your marriage."" New dating site helps college students find love . Harvard University senior Chris Jackson married Leah Cogan, a senior at Brown University, on July 1. Before getting married, Jackson said he found it difficult to balance school and his relationship with Cogan, who was about an hourlong train ride away. ""Ideally, you'd have all your work done during the week so we could hang out during the weekend, but it didn't usually work out that way,"" he said. Both have one more semester to complete. They plan to divide the year in two, starting at Cambridge in the fall and ending at Providence in the spring, so they're not separated again. Though all marriages are vulnerable in the first few years, experts say people who marry at age 21 or younger are more susceptible to divorce. ""The longer you can wait to get married up to approximately age 30, the greater your chances are at having a successful and stable committed relationship stay intact,"" Roberts said . Kate and Paul Bowers got married before their senior year at the University of South Carolina and celebrated their first anniversary last month. Kate Bowers said she appreciates the ""smaller moments"" of married life -- like grocery shopping together -- which they didn't experience when dating. Paul Bowers, who started a blog called Married in College, said he didn't miss out on anything by becoming a husband as an undergrad. ""There's this idea that the college experience is based on watching 'Animal House' too many times, but we didn't go to a lot of parties ... we lived a pretty simple lifestyle,"" he said. Though the Bowers are confident they'll be together forever, the average divorce or separation rate for a couple marrying for the first time is 40% to 50%, according to the 2010 State of Our Unions report by the National Marriage Project. Wilcox said financial trouble is a leading cause of marital distress and divorce, which could pose problems for married college students accruing debt from student loans. ""Once they've graduated from college and are in the process of paying off that debt, that's something that would be a drag on their marriage and would hang like a cloud over them,"" he said. Despite dealing with the stress of student debt, educated couples have better chances for a happy marriage. Americans with at least a bachelor's degree are more likely than those with only a high school diploma to have a stable, high-quality marriage, according to the State of Our Unions report. Religious couples are also less likely to divorce than nonreligious couples. Arwa Abdelhadi, a 19-year-old student at the University of Missouri, signed the Islamic marriage contract with her 27-year-old fiancÃÂ© last month. Though she's a devout Muslim, Abdelhadi said her religion played no part in her decision to marry at a young age. ""I've had several older ladies come up to me from the community and tell me, 'Oh, you're so young. You have so much time,' but I think if I've found the right person -- he's the one -- then why should I wait?"" Abdelhadi said. As Wilcox put it, married students often get pestered because they are ""breaking the norm."" ""You get a lot of raised eyebrows and questions directed to you when you marry in college,"" he said. Society expects people to go to college, get a job and then get married, he said. Research also supports the position that the best age to wed is in the mid- to upper-20s, he added. ""It's at that point when you can really form a common life together,"" Wilcox said. ""You're not set in your ways, you can build traditions, you can build hobbies -- things you do together as a couple that will really shape your entire adult life."" Balancing books and babies . Regnerus added that parents and peers ""suspect there's no way you could possibly know what you want at age 20 or 21."" Ritchie's mother, Doris Ritchie, is one exception. She's thrilled about her daughter's marriage and said she will chip in financially and help plan the wedding as much as possible. She's also not ashamed to admit, ""I'm anxious and eager for them to bring me grandchildren.""","Tying the knot in college is considered counter-cultural today .

"(CNN) -- If there's any truth in the old saw that London's streets are paved with gold, it's probably because they've been gilded by cash stripped from the pockets of tourists. It won't surprise anyone who's seen their budget evaporate seconds after exiting their over-priced hotel, but the English metropolis has been named the world's priciest city break destination. Review site TripAdvisor compared prices in 48 leading tourist destinations to conclude that London has overtaken Oslo as the world capital of the inadvertent splurge. According to the site's annual TripIndex Cities study, seven of the world's 10 most expensive destinations are in Europe. Asia fields the majority of the list's most affordable cities for a holiday. The list says an evening out and overnight stay in a four-star hotel in London will relieve visitors of $523 -- more than three times the cost of the same break in Hanoi, which is named as best value. Travelers to Paris should be warned against working up too much of thirst while pounding its boulevards -- the city is identified as the priciest place for pre-dinner cocktails. Two dry martinis there set drinkers back an average $52. Even then the cocktails will probably be watered down by the salty tears of whoever's footing the bill. New York still the place for expensive hotels . TripAdvisor's research reveals Stockholm is the costliest place for an evening meal. For the same money in Hanoi visitors can can pay for a four-star hotel, cab fare, cocktails, dinner for two and still have enough change to call Sweden and gloat. New York tops the list for expensive hotels for the second year running, with a night in a four-star hotel costing an average of $365 -- four times the price of the same deal in Bangkok. While Oslo may have lost out to London in the overall list, the Norwegian city still rules when it comes to taxi fares. There, a three-kilometer (1.9 mile) journey will set customers back $57. In Jakarta, the cheapest city, the same journey can be made for less than $3. Here's TripAdvisor's top 10 of most expensive cities: London, Paris, New York, Stockholm, Oslo, Zurich, Copenhagen, Helsinki, Toronto, Sydney. Here are the site's best value destinations: Hanoi, Jakarta, Sharm el Sheikh, Bangkok, Sofia, Cape Town, Mumbai, Kuala Lumpur, Prague, Budapest.","London named most expensive city destination in TripAdvisor survey .

"(CNN) -- The Veterans Affairs health care system needs to be overhauled because of unresponsive leadership and a ""corrosive culture"" that affects the delivery of medical care, said a report delivered Friday to President Barack Obama. ""It is clear that there are significant and chronic systemic failures that must be addressed by the leadership at VA,"" said the report prepared by Rob Nabors, who is Obama's deputy chief of staff and who the President dispatched to assess the situation at the troubled agency. The VA, a massive bureaucracy with more than 300,000 full-time employees, is under fire over allegations of alarming shortcomings at its medical facilities. The controversy, as CNN first reported, involves delayed care with potentially fatal consequences in possibly dozens of cases. Nabors and acting VA Secretary Sloan Gibson met with Obama to discuss the findings. Excessive waiting periods . At the Veterans Affairs medical center in Phoenix, for example, a preliminary report made public last month indicated that at least 1,700 military veterans waiting to see a doctor were never scheduled for an appointment and were never placed on a wait list. CNN has reported that in Phoenix, the VA used fraudulent record-keeping -- including an alleged secret list -- that covered up excessive waiting periods for veterans, some of whom died in the process. But the problems go well beyond Phoenix. Dozens of others of VA centers, all around the country, also face a host of allegations like possible abuse of scheduling practices. Indeed. The report mentioned the Inspector General is now investigating 77 VA facilities, more than were previously reported. 'Corrosive culture' hurts morale . The report issued Friday stressed that the vast majority of employees are dedicated and hard-working. Yet, it cited a ""corrosive culture"" that created personnel problems across the department and hurt morale and, by extension, timeliness of medical care. When problems occur, they are transferred to other departments minimized or not acknowledged at all, the report said, and the culture ""encourages discontent and backlash against employees."" ""The department must take swift and appropriate accountability actions,"" the report said. ""There must be a recognition of how true accountability works."" Lack of transparency cited . The report called for an overhaul of leadership at the Veterans Medical Administration. ""It currently acts with little transparency or accountability with regard to its management of the VA medical structure,"" the report said. The VA central office could solve this problem with more transparency and by taking a more hands-on approach with regional leaders, the report said. Other key findings of the report: . -- The 14-day scheduling standard for a medical appointment is ""arbitrary, ill-defined, and misunderstood."" The goal was deemed unrealistic and ""is a poor indicator of either patient satisfaction or quality of care"" and should be replaced. -- The technology behind the basic scheduling system is ""cumbersome and outdated."" -- Additional resources, including doctors, nurses, trained support staff and other health professionals, are needed. -- Many of the resource issues facing the VA are similar to what exists in the private sector. But the VA has not clearly articulated its funding needs. The VA health system is the nation's largest, with more than 1,700 sites serving 8.76 million people annually. The scandal has already created political waves. Eric Shinseki resigned in May as the head of the Department of Veterans Affairs. Obama has requested an appropriation of $163.9 billion for the department in the 2015 budget, a 6.5% increase over the 2014 budget. U.S. Rep. Jeff Miller of Florida, chairman of the House Committee on Veterans' Affairs, said, ""It appears the White House has finally come to terms with the serious and systemic VA health care problems we've been investigating and documenting for years.""","Report on VA medical system stems from allegations of shortcomings .

"(CNN) -- It was Wednesday morning when I noticed a popular post on reddit that shared an unbelievable photo of a $1,300 HDMI cable. Yes. One HDMI cable. Thirteen hundred dollars. Naturally, I ordered three on my corporate AmEX and expensed them as ""miscellaneous."" (Also recently expensed as miscellaneous: NFL Sunday Ticket, Pop Tarts and a pony keg of Schlitz. I think HR is on the ninth floor. I'll just head up there now.) At first, I thought it had to be a simple labeling mistake at whatever store the picture was taken. But it was real. A company called AudioQuest sells Diamond brand HDMI cables that cost more than my actual TV. And I fully support it. I mean, somebody must be buying them. Granted, I'm not sure how Diamond HDMI cables satisfy a rich man's narcissism, but surely these work better than, say, driving around in my Saturn. Or as all the sexy ladies in Atlanta call it ... my Saturn. I first entered the dirty world of HDMI cables a couple years ago when I finally purchased a new TV. Although, to be slightly more accurate, I finally purchased Netflix streaming, and then I had to buy a new TV. First month of Netflix streaming: $1,200. You see, since 2006, I had been enjoying an old, 65-inch Toshiba that a friend gave me. It was old in that he was more than happy to give it away. And it was large in that it was an actual hippopotamus that somehow aired Seinfeld reruns. Fast forward to November 2010 when, suddenly, my life wasn't complete without Netflix streaming. But there was one little problem: My hippopotamus didn't have the correct hardware in the back to properly connect my laptop. Clearly this meant it was time for a new TV. I can be rather impulsive. (I wonder how my Facebook stock is doing.) Next thing I know there's a 55-inch LED LCD in my shopping cart and a kid with pimples trying to tell me why I absolutely, positively needed $40 Monster-brand HDMI cables. I admit, his case was compelling. Apparently, if I didn't get the good cables, my new TV would grow up to be a serial killer. So I bought the stupid cables and boasted about my big purchase to a colleague at work the next day. ""Dude, this TV is great -- Netflix is actually built in! And I got these amazing HDMI cables that really bring out the high-def. They only cost like 40 bucks each."" To which he replied, ""Shouldn't you be wearing pants?"" He later advised me to buy cheap, $3 cables online, and so far the HD still seems to be coming in perfectly. I can pick out individual hairs in Wolf Blitzer's beard. Which brings us back to Diamond cables. The company's website says: . ""Diamond HDMI incorporates AudioQuest's highest-performance, lowest-distortion Perfect-Surface Silver conductors. Silver is known for its high conductivity and its 'colorless' sonic presentation."" I have no idea what this means, but it seems to suggest that, if I were to buy the Diamond cable, Wolf's beard actually would jump out of the TV and make me an omelet. I could be wrong. I don't generally get things. And reading through any HDMI discussion online will only further the confusion. Some people say quality cables matter. Some people say they don't. In the end, it's all ones and zeroes to me. If you look for an expert opinion from Consumer Reports, however, you'll find they say ""we've long been advocates of not paying for pricey cables, which often do little more than pad the pockets of the manufacturers that make them and the retailers that sell them."" The only reasons to buy anything but low-end cables, they say, is if you plan to unplug and replug the cables all the time or if the cable is longer than 30 feet. Otherwise, ""any high-speed cable should suffice,"" the group says, ""and don't let a package or retail associate tell you otherwise."" Still, you've got to hand it to them. AudioQuest cares about performance, and they seem to specialize in super-high-end everything. I actually found a $6,900 AC power cable on Amazon. AudioQuest calls it the NRG WEL Signature Series. I call it ""miscellaneous."" The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Jarrett Bellini.","AudioQuest sells Diamond brand HDMI cables for $1,300 .

"(CNN)  -- Some subjects are just plain hard to talk about. Religion, politics and money  -- maybe sex, too. But try talking about race and then add the emotional context of a death penalty trial, and no one will talk at all. If you try to broach the subject during jury selection, asking all the racists to please raise their hands is not an option. We, as a nation, have to find a way to face the dirty secret of criminal justice -- that prejudice often carries the day. The issue of racial disparity in the administration of the death penalty has been a part of modern law. Starting with Furman v. Georgia and continuing on to McCleskey v. Zant, courts have struggled to come to grips with this issue as have those of us defending the most despised amongst us. Jury selection is actually a process of elimination: Potential jurors are called for jury duty and are questioned and either seated, excused for a cause or excused by a peremptory challenge from either side.  Generally, a challenge for cause involves jurors who have a relationship with a party or witness, have a personal experience that would cause them to be unfair or are legally unable to sit. In capital cases, the number of potential jurors who can be excluded for cause is much larger because anyone who is against the death penalty can be turned away -- and minorities are more likely to find problems with the death penalty. Then there's the misuse of peremptory challenges -- each side gets a certain number of these that it can use to excuse a juror for any reason. The prosecution often uses this strategy to strike as many minorities from serving as jurors as it can. The problem this creates is obvious. A black or Hispanic defendant facing death is the most likely to have an all, or nearly all, white jury. To combat this, the U.S. Supreme Court in Batson v. Kentucky held that the defense could object if it believed the prosecution was using its peremptory challenges to limit the number of minority jurors. If the trial judge so ordered, the prosecution would then be obliged to give ""race-neutral"" reasons for the exclusions. If the trial court accepted these explanations, the trial would continue. If not, a mistrial would be declared. This procedure was supposed to fix the problem. It hasn't had that effect. Almost any excuse will do -- a prosecutor can call the juror ""arrogant"" for example, and that is enough. In one case I tried, the prosecution excused a black woman who was married, a homeowner, had two children and taught elementary school. They kept a white woman who was married, a homeowner, had three children and taught elementary school.  His ""race-neutral"" explanation? The black woman wore her dress too tight. No kidding. And the judge accepted that explanation. Obviously, prosecutors know that this form of discrimination increases their odds of winning, and the desire to win is hard to resist. But a prosecutor is supposed to represent the people of his or her state or the federal government, and that includes not only the victim and his or her family, and public safety, but the accused and the community. Systematic exclusion of a race from jury selection sends an ugly message -- African Americans and Hispanics need not apply. In an analysis of Jefferson Parish, the Louisiana Capital Assistance Center found that from 1999 to 2007, blacks were struck from juries at more than three times the rate of whites. The Equal Justice Initiative of Alabama has just issued a report, ""Illegal Racial Discrimination Jury Selection: A Continuing Legacy,"" that details racial discrimination in jury selection in eight Southern states. ""Key decision makers in death-penalty cases across the country are almost exclusively white,"" the Equal Justice Initiative said. Then there is the case of Curtis Flowers, as reported by CNN. He is about to be tried for the sixth time for the same crime in a case marred by racial discrimination in jury selection. We might think in this supposed ""post-racial"" world we are past discrimination, but we aren't. Not by a long shot. Confronting racial attitudes in the courtroom is often necessary. The problem is fear.  When a lawyer speaks up about these issues, he or she is inviting anger from the prosecution, potentially the judge and maybe even the jury. But we have to talk about this -- and by ""we"" I mean not only defense lawyers, but all of us -- and openly. The courts have to stop glossing over the problem by pretending that ""race-neutral"" reasons really exist or are even close to satisfactory. And courts should name the offending parties. The prosecutor who said he didn't want the teacher on the jury because of her so-called tight dress might have hesitated if he knew his name could be published. In one case I tried, the complaining witness was white, the defendant black, and race was all over the case. I was afraid to talk about it, but I believed it was a motivating force behind the choice to prosecute at all. So I took a deep breath and spoke. The jurors acquitted and thanked me for giving them permission to speak about race -- so they could talk about it and then move on and be able to ""get to the case."" It's time we all did the same. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Andrea Lyon.","Andrea Lyon: Racial discrimination in jury selection frequent in death penalty cases .

"(CNN) -- The beating of a gay man during a gay pride festival in Detroit over the weekend was caught on camera. Christin Howard, a 20-year-old hair dresser, was attacked by a group of men on Detroit's Riverwalk during the Motor City Pride event on Sunday. A video shot by a bystander shows the group kicking and punching Howard. Christin told CNN affiliate WXYZ he was taking a picture with a friend when things suddenly turned violent. A group of men began to ""gay bash"" him, he said, hurling anti-gay slurs his way. Then they started to physically attack him. ""I just thought I was going to die. At one point I thought they were going to kill me,"" Howard said. The attack left Howard bruised with a bloody eye, cuts and a broken finger, leaving him unable to sleep or work. David Wait, chair of Motor City Pride, called the incident troubling, adding that he'd noticed ""record attendance on Sunday and we took steps to increase security."" Wait praised police for their ""swift efforts"" at investigating the crime. Other advocates for the LGBT community in Michigan say this attack means there is more work to do. ""No one should have to endure an attack like Christin Howard did ... pride celebrations offer people in our communities an opportunity to feel safe in expressing our authentic selves,"" said Yvnoone Siferd, director of victim services for Equality Michigan. As for Howard, he is on the fence about returning to the festival next year. ""I'm kind of iffy about it now, because I don't want that same incident to happen again,"" he said. ""What if the same guys (are) down there?"" The Detroit Police Department is investigating and calls the attack a hate crime. ""We know about the video. We are seeking public assistance in identifying people in the video,"" said Nicole Kirkwood, a public information officer for the Detroit Police Department.","Video captures beating of 20-year-old man at Detroit gay pride festival .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- An online petition demanding a formal apology from the British government for its treatment of World War II code-breaker Alan Turing is gaining momentum. A portrait of Alan Turing is currently on display at the National Portrait Gallery's ""Gay Icons"" exhibition. Turing was subjected to chemical castration in 1952 after being found guilty of the charge of gross indecency for having a homosexual relationship, an illegal act at the time. He committed suicide two years later. More than 19,000 people have added their names to the petition on the UK Government Web site since it opened three weeks ago, urging the government to ""recognize the tragic consequences of prejudice that ended this man's life and career."" The petition was created by computer scientist John Graham-Cumming, who said he grew ""mad"" at the country's memory of a man he says should be considered one of its national heroes. ""I'm looking for an apology from the British government because that's where I think the wrong was done. But Turing is clearly someone of international stature,"" Graham-Cumming said. Turing was best known for inventing the Bombe, a code-breaking machine that deciphered messages encoded by German Enigma machines during World War II. The messages provided the Allies with crucial information from the British government's code-breaking headquarters in Bletchley Park where Turing worked full-time during the war. He was considered a mathematical genius and went on to develop the Turing machine, a theory that automatic computation cannot solve all mathematical problems, which is considered the basis of modern computing. However, to avoid a custodial sentence for gross indecency Turing agreed to undergo chemical castration. He was injected with estrogen, an experience that is widely believed to have led to his suicide just two years later. Turing was just 41 when he ended his life by eating an apple laced with cyanide. Graham-Cumming has not yet received a response from the British government to his request for an apology, nor has he received a reply from Queen Elizabeth II to whom he wrote last week asking that Turing be considered for a posthumous knighthood. ""There is no doubt in my mind,"" he wrote, ""that if Turing had lived past age 41 his international impact would have been great and that he likely would have received a knighthood while alive."" Graham-Cumming's efforts to draw attention to Turing's life has attracted an international response. ""This morning I woke up to an inbox stuffed full of e-mails and blog postings from around the world on Turing, and many people were saying 'it's a pity I can't sign the British petition,'"" he said. The main online petition is only open to British citizens. Supporters have set up a second international petition which has attracted more than 5,000 signatures. Graham-Cumming is not fazed. ""My focus is really on Britain at the moment because I think that is where the greatest need is, but I'm very happy for anyone in the world to know about Alan Turing."" High-profile signatories to the petition include author Ian McEwan, evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins, and gay rights campaigner Peter Tatchell. Graham-Cumming said  if the government would not extend an apology, ""the least it could do is to put Bletchley Park on a sound financial footing in Turing's name."" Earlier this year, the center's supporters created their own online petition urging the government to ""save Bletchley Park."" The site receives no external funding and has been turned down for funds by the UK National Lottery, and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. The government replied to the petition last week saying that, while it ""agrees that the buildings on the Bletchley Park site are of significant historic importance and, although recognizing the excellent work being carried out there, at present it has no plans, nor the resources, to extend its sponsorship of museums and galleries beyond the present number."" Simon Greenish, director of the Bletchley Park Trust, said: ""The work that Turing did during the war has never really been properly recognized and this is an opportunity [for the government] to do that."" He said the government had also failed to recognize the contribution of Bletchley Park to the war effort: ""What went on in those buildings was absolutely vital to the outcome of World War II."" The center receives more than 100,000 visitors a year and is staffed mainly by volunteers. A portrait of Turing is currently on display at the National Portrait Gallery in London, as part of its ""Gay Icons"" exhibition. He was one of the six personal icons selected by contributor Chris Smith, Britain's first openly gay Member of Parliament.","More than 19,000 people sign petition calling for apology for Alan Turing .

"(CNN) -- A new standard may about to be set for the most boring in-flight movie ever -- and it doesn't even star Keanu Reeves. Passengers flying British Airways will soon be able to zone out to a film that shows every inch of a slow-speed train journey to the Norwegian capital. The airline says the film, ""The Seven Hour Train Journey to Oslo,"" will appeal to people who enjoy ""wallpaper"" viewing experiences like the barely moving maps that chart flight progress. The airline will start screening the feature in July alongside its usual schedule of classics, blockbusters and those lame romantic comedies that shouldn't make passengers bawl their eyes out, but inevitably do. The film features no commentary to liven up the proceedings, but highlights are said to include going into tunnels and some children waving from a station. (CNN cannot independently confirm this, it doesn't have a spare seven hours to kill.) 'Hypnotic and calming' Though undeniably tedious, the train ride film could prove an unexpected hit -- as it did when it first screened to more than one million viewers on Norway's NRK state television. So-called ""slow TV"" has attracted a cult audience in Scandinavia, with other classics including a burning fireplace and a game of chess. It goes without saying: winter nights are long in Norway, but so is intercontinental air travel. ""There's definitely a hypnotic, calming and entertaining quality to 'Slow TV' that is perfect for in-flight entertainment,"" says Richard D'Cruze, who oversees onboard movie programming for BA.

"(CNN) -- Spain's football duopoly of Real Madrid and Barcelona has become so dominant that sponsors have lost interest in backing other Spanish clubs. ""Having two monsters like Real Madrid and FC Barcelona, the world's leading concert in football, overshadows the other clubs,"" financial expert Jose Maria Gay de Liebana told CNN. ""Sports sponsorship companies are more inclined to be the third or fourth sponsor of these two great clubs, Barcelona and Madrid, rather than be the first sponsor of a club without universal screening,"" he added. Gay de Liebana told CNN that the apparent advantage of having global brands in the top tier of Spanish football -- known as La Liga -- is in fact a serious detriment to many clubs. According to Forbes Magazine's 2012 rankings, Real Madrid is the richest club in the world by revenue -- $695 million -- and second only to Manchester United in market value. Burden . Meanwhile, Barcelona -- widely recognized as the best football team in the world with a pedigree of stars such as Lionel Messi and Andres Iniesta -- is the second richest club in the world by revenue. Gay de Liebana says the presence of these two football behemoths combined with billions of euros of debt - estimated at $4.5 billion for Primera Division teams -- and liabilities has meant Spanish football clubs can no longer cope with this burden. Traditionally local governments in Spain have had a role to play in the financial management of football clubs. In the past, teams such as Valencia and Madrid, as sporting institutions, have received subsidies from local authorities, according to Spanish football expert Sid Lowe. But in the current economic climate, state investment in football clubs is not a high priority for many politicians as the central government in Madrid grapples with a spiralling national debt and chronic unemployment of over 25%. Spain -- the eurozone's fourth largest economy -- is likely to be the next bailout casualty of the debt crisis in the 17-nation currency union. The government in Madrid has already requested a rescue package for its ailing banks, which require almost 60 billion euros ($76.4 million) in support following an audit in September. Real Oviedo's plea . Further down the feeding chain of Spanish football the financial situation is even more dire -- so much so that one Spanish club in the third division -- Real Oviedo -- has turned to football fans for help. Earlier this month the Asturias-based team launched a campaign, whereby fans could effectively buy shares at approximately 11 euros [$13] each in exchange for a token stake in the club. Word of Real Oviedo's plight went viral on Twitter and football fans across the globe responded by purchasing shares and raising more than one million euros ($1.2 million) in nine days. Gay de Liebana argued that the current state of Spanish football clubs is the result of poor financial regulation and supervision. When asked whether other teams might also stand on the precipice of extinction, he said: ""I absolutely know it will happen... The next few months -- and I hope I am wrong -- will be tragic for some clubs.""","Spanish football clubs struggle to find sponsorship and marketing deals in economic crisis .

"(CNN) -- You can still feel the heat from ""Do the Right Thing."" Though the Spike Lee Joint, about the angry events of a scorching hot day in Brooklyn, looks a bit dated these days -- gone are the boomboxes and fade haircuts of the late '80s -- there's no fighting the film's power. The issues raised by the film -- gentrification, ethnic clashes, police presence, the impact of violence -- remain topical. So does its thoughtfulness, something that was overlooked, both then and later. ""Do the Right Thing"" was released 25 years ago Monday. It had a reputation before it even opened. ""Do the Right Thing"" would doom race relations, said critics. Riots would engulf the multiplex. One can only imagine the fear that would have been stoked in the Internet age. Instead, what audiences found was a film more infused with sadness (and humor!) than anger, less black and white than shades of gray. Sal, the pizzeria owner played by Danny Aiello, was gruff but fatherly. Mookie, Lee's delivery man character, was immature but not mean. The rest of the characters -- the music-loving Radio Raheem (Bill Nunn), the drunken Mayor and Mother Sister (Ossie Davis and Ruby Dee), even the pot-stirring Buggin Out (Giancarlo Esposito) -- were humans, not props. New York has changed in 25 years. Today blacks and Italians both listen to hip-hop, the pop music of our times. The Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood, where the film takes place, was once considered rough -- now ""the people who once considered Bed-Stuy a jungle lazily walk their tiny dogs past me,"" wrote Jason Reynolds in Gawker. Even Lee, who can still get fired up about gentrification, acknowledged the barbed world of ""Do the Right Thing"" has lost some of its prickliness. ""When I wrote the script ... New York City was a very polarized city, racially,"" he told CNN in 2009. ""I wanted to do a film that would try to show what was happening at the time."" On the other hand, look at the vitriol on the Web. Look at the battles between red and blue states. Look at the ever-present conflict between violence and nonviolence. The movie still haunts our culture. As Lee said in 2009, ""We've got a lot of work to do."" Still, he can admire his handiwork. In an interview with Rolling Stone, he talked about ""Do the Right Thing"" with pleasure. ""It still holds up!"" he said.

"(CNN) -- Former U.S. Sen. Charles Percy, a prominent Illinois Republican who served in the Senate for nearly 20 years and became chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, died Saturday, said a spokesman for Sen. Jay Rockefeller, a relative. He was 91. Percy, a one-time rising star in the Republican Party who was once considered a potential presidential candidate, was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1966 and served until 1985. His daughter, Sharon, the wife of Rockefeller (D-West Virginia), spoke publicly in 2009 of her father experiencing Alzheimer's disease. She made those remarks before the National Alzheimer's Association. Born in Florida and raised in Chicago's far north neighborhood of Rogers Park and the well-to-do suburb of Winnetka, Percy was regarded a business wunderkind who rose to become the president, CEO and board chairman of Bell & Howell, a manufacturer of made home-movie cameras and electronic consumer products. He became president at age 29. He was appointed as President Dwight Eisenhower's personal representative to presidential inaugurations in Peru and Bolivia with the rank of special ambassador in 1956. After an unsuccessful run for governor of Illinois in 1964, he successfully ran for the U.S. Senate two years later. While campaigning in 1966, Percy's other daughter, Valerie, Sharon's twin, was murdered at age 21 in the family's Kenilworth, Illinois, home, a crime that shocked Illinois and the nation. The murder is unsolved, but remains a vivid memory for many residents of Chicago and Illinois who knew Percy. While in the Senate, Percy emerged as an antagonist to President Richard Nixon, also a Republican, when Percy called for a special prosecutor to investigate Watergate, the political scandal that eventually culminated in Nixon's resignation. Percy considered running for the 1976 presidential nomination, but he backed off after Nixon resigned in 1974 and after Vice President Gerald Ford became the new president and decided to seek the 1976 nomination himself.","NEW: Percy once considered running for president in 1976 .

"(CNN) -- Just weeks before U.S. Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl walked off base and into Taliban hands, a British filmmaker caught on video scenes that would come to define his unit as an unruly, undisciplined bunch. The video, published by the British newspaper The Guardian, showed some soldiers breaking Army rules by not wearing helmets while in the field. Filmmaker Sean Smith filmed Bergdahl and his platoon in 2009 as they built a fortified bunker near several villages in the Paktika province of Afghanistan. One of Bergdahl's fellow soldiers can be heard sympathizing with Afghan villagers in the video. ""They (Afghans) got (messed) with from the Russians for 17 years, and then now we're here. I'd gladly leave them alone,"" the soldier says. An Army source tells CNN discipline in the platoon was ""lax."" A sergeant was demoted and two other sergeants were re-assigned after the pictures became public, according to a 2012 Rolling Stone article. Bergdahl's former team leader, Sgt. Evan Buetow, said the footage was blown out of proportion. ""There were some people who were really angry that soldiers weren't wearing their protective equipment out in the field. It was something that got exaggerated way bigger than it should have,"" Buetow told CNN, adding that soldiers were disciplined. A U.S. official who has been briefed on the initial Army fact-finding investigation conducted in the months after Bergdahl disappeared told CNN that some of Bergdahl's teammates said he had expressed ""boredom"" and thought his unit was too passive and should have been ""kicking down doors,"" the official said. A former lieutenant colonel who advised officials investigating Bergdahl's disappearance said that while some of the unit's commanders did not have their act together, their behavior does not explain why Bergdahl left his platoon. ""There's nothing going on here that could justify in my mind or justify in anyone that I've talked to about this that would allow for or explain Bergdahl simply walking away and abandoning his post,"" retired Army Lt. Col. Tony Shaffer said. While investigators continue to speculate about motivations, one common theme has emerged -- Bergdahl walked away.

"Washington (CNN) -- The U.S. Supreme Court has rejected review of a closely watched religious liberty appeal over a business owner's right to deny services to gays and lesbians. Without comment Monday, justices denied the petition of a New Mexico photographer who was sanctioned under state law for refusing to document a lesbian couple's commitment ceremony. The court's refusal to intervene means those financial penalties stand. The case would have given the high court an opportunity to debate a pair of hot-button social issues: faith in the marketplace and same-sex marriage. The court has been tackling separate appeals on both fronts. At issue here was how to classify the owner's refusal to offer her services -- as constitutionally protected speech or ""commercial conduct"" subject to government regulation. Elaine and Jonathan Huguenin are co-owners of Elane Photography in Albuquerque. They were asked in 2006 to capture on film the commitment ceremony of Vanessa Willock and Misti Collinsworth. New Mexico at the time did not allow same-sex marriage but now is one of 17 states that have legalized it. Elaine Huguenin refused the e-mailed request, explaining later that her work is blended with her beliefs, where the artist and potential client must both feel comfortable collaborating to create a special lifetime memory. New Mexico high court rules same-sex couples have right to marry . She and her husband concluded they could not ""in good conscience"" do so, since they would be compelled to convey and ""celebrate"" someone else's contrary views. ""The message a same-sex commitment ceremony communicates is not one I believe,"" she said. Willock and Collinsworth found another photographer to shoot the ceremony in Taos but later filed a complaint with the state's Human Rights Commission. New Mexico's ""public accommodations"" law forbids businesses from discriminating on the basis of sexual orientation, among other things. The commission ruled against the Huguenins and fined them $6,637.94 in attorney fees. The New Mexico Supreme Court unanimously agreed, concluding that this was a ""neutral law of general applicability"" and that the ""First Amendment does not exempt creative or expressive businesses from anti-discrimination laws."" Elane Photography had raised only a compelled speech claim, but the religious liberty aspects formed a key part of the owners' appeal to the justices. ""The Huguenins will not create images that tell stories or convey messages contrary to their religious beliefs,"" their lawyers said in a legal brief. The U.S. Supreme Court's denial of this appeal comes a month after Arizona's governor vetoed SB 1062, a Republican-led measure that would have allowed businesses to deny services to gay and lesbian customers, as long as the owners asserted their faith-based beliefs. Supporters said the measure promoted religious freedom, but opponents said it discriminated against gays and lesbians. The state's Republican U.S. senators and a bipartisan coalition of business and advocacy groups urged that it be repealed. At least a dozen other states are considering similar legislation, including Florida, Idaho, Kansas, Mississippi, Ohio, Oklahoma, Mississippi and South Dakota. Arizona's anti-gay bill veto unlikely to end 'religious freedom' movement . An important aspect of the New Mexico case was whether artistic or communication-driven businesses should be exempt from the law, when as the Huguenins argued, ""compelled speech"" might be the result. Lawyers for the photographers told the high court in their legal brief that ""Ms. Huguenin, and not her customer, is the speaker communicating through her photographs and books. ... They believe that if they were to communicate a contrary message about marriage -- by, for example, telling the story of a polygamous wedding ceremony -- they would be disobeying God."" The had earlier pointed to New Mexico's Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which says the state may not unduly burden a person's free exercise of religion. It is one of 18 similar state measures around the U.S. A similar federal law was passed in 1993, and the high court is deciding whether it applies to for-profit businesses that refuse to provide certain contraception health coverage to their employees under Obamacare. Some companies say those health care mandates violate their religious convictions. The Huguenins' supporters also pointed to past U.S. Supreme Court cases, including one allowing privately groups in Boston to keep gay and lesbian activists from marching in the annual St. Patrick's Day parade on city streets. But Willock's attorneys framed the issue in stark terms. ""The law simply says: Whatever service you provide, you must not discriminate against customers when you engage in public commerce,"" they said in their legal brief. ""Moreover, when the company sells its goods and services to the general public, it is not a private actor engaged in the expression of its own message. Customers do not pay for the privilege of facilitating the company's message."" And they highlighted a body of high court precedent supporting their views, including a 2006 decision saying colleges must allow military recruiters on campus or risk the loss of federal funds, even if the schools disagreed with the Pentagon's policy at the time banning gays and lesbians from openly serving in the armed forces. Willock argued that by offering client services to the general public, the photography business could not then pick and choose based on sexual orientation. Such discrimination protection, her lawyers said, would also apply if Huguenin refused to sell her artistic creations in a gallery to gay and lesbian patrons. Other courts have agreed on the broader questions. A Colorado judge last year ruled against a suburban Denver baker who refused to custom-create a cake for a gay couple's wedding reception. That administrative law judge said the business owner had ""no free speech right to refuse because they were only asked to bake a cake, not make a speech."" The New Mexico case is Elane Photography LLC v. Willock (13-585).","Court won't review appeal of case about a business's right to deny services to gays, lesbians .

"(CNN) -- Mercedes domination of the Formula One season came to a shuddering halt in final qualifying for the Austrian Grand Prix Saturday as Brazilian veteran Felipe Massa took pole position. Massa held off Williams teammate Valtteri Bottas of Finland with championship leader Nico Rosberg only third for Mercedes. Rosberg's teammate Lewis Hamilton fared worse, having to settle for ninth fastest on an afternoon of upsets. Hamilton, 22 points behind Rosberg in the title race after failing to finish in the previous round in Montreal, had his first effort in the last session of qualifying ruled out for running wide on the circuit then spun on the second. It was the 33-year-old Massa who adapted best to the twisting circuit at Spielberg, which is being used to host the first Austrian Grand Prix since Michael Schumacher won in 2003. His time of one minute 8.579 seconds gave him his 16th career F1 pole and deprived Rosberg of his third straight pole. ""I'm so happy with what's happened today with us, our team. It's such a great moment. It's been a long time since I had my last pole position, which was in Brazil in 2008,"" Massa said. Mercedes, with Williams pressing them, had dominated the three practice sessions ahead of qualifying so Rosberg was surprised to trail when it mattered. ""I definitely didn't expect Williams to be ahead of me today but they did a good job,"" the German said. ""I will do my best. It was a strong performance (from Massa and Bottas) but I think I can be faster in the race. So we'll see... I think I have good chances,"" he added. It was a disappointing afternoon for Red Bull after Daniel Ricciardo's victory in Canada where both Rosberg and Hamilton suffered technical problems. Ricciardo eventually finished fifth -- just behind Ferrari's Fernando Alonso -- but four-time world champion Sebastian Vettel failed to even make the final session and had to settle for 13th fastest. The hiccup in Montreal aside, where Rosberg still managed second place, Mercedes had enjoyed a near perfect season heading into Austria with six victories and seven pole positions. Force India's Sergio Perez took 11th spot in qualifying, but will be penalized five places on the grid for his part in a late and high speed crash with Massa in Montreal two weeks ago. Massa had to receive medical treatment after the horrific incident but has rebounded back in some style.","Felipe Massa on pole for Austrian Grand Prix .

"(CNN) -- Every day millions of women apply lipstick without a second thought. What many don't know is that lipsticks may contain lead, the notorious metal that can cause learning, language and behavioral problems. Lead is a neurotoxin and can be dangerous even at small doses. So what's lead doing in lipsticks? Not all lipsticks contain lead, but a number of studies in recent years show that the metal is more prevalent than previously thought. In 2007, the Campaign for Safe Cosmetics conducted a study -- ""A Poison Kiss"" -- that detected lead in 61% of the 33 lipsticks tested, with levels ranging from 0.03 ppm to 0.65 ppm. Parts per million (ppm) is the measurement of lead in the environment. Medical experts say there is no safe level of lead in the blood. The FDA says it doesn't consider the lead levels it found in lipsticks to be a safety issue. No lipstick lists lead as an ingredient. The amounts are small, but the presence of lead in lipstick, which is ingested and absorbed through the skin, raises concerns about the safety of a cosmetic product that is wildly popular among women. Urged on by both consumers and the cosmetics industry, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration conducted its own testing in 2010. The FDA's results were even more astonishing: The agency detected lead in all 400 lipsticks tested, ranging from 0.9 to 3.06 ppm -- four times higher than the levels observed in the study done by Campaign for Safe Cosmetics. And lead isn't the only toxic metal you may be applying to your lips. In a recent study, University of California researchers tested eight lipsticks and 24 lip glosses and detected nine toxic heavy metals, including chromium, cadmium, manganese, aluminum and lead. The FDA said, ""We have assessed the potential for harm to consumers from use of lipstick containing lead at the levels found in both rounds of testing. Lipstick, as a product intended for topical use with limited absorption, is ingested only in very small quantities. We do not consider the lead levels we found in the lipsticks to be a safety concern."" Likewise, the cosmetics industry also doesn't see this as an issue, saying that the dose makes the poison -- in other words, the trace amounts of heavy metals in lipsticks are not harmful. But the FDA noted, ""Although we do not believe that the lead content found in our recent lipstick analyses poses a safety concern, we are evaluating whether there may be a need to recommend an upper limit for lead in lipstick in order to further protect the health and welfare of consumers. "" Indeed, what the FDA and the cosmetics industry have been ignoring is cumulative exposure and potential long-term adverse effects. It's true that a single lipstick application will not lead to harm. And the good news is that not all lipsticks contain detectable levels of lead or other heavy metals. (And by the way, cost doesn't seem to be a factor; a cheap or expensive lipstick isn't the determinant of how much lead is present.) The problem is when women who wear lipstick apply it two to 14 times a day, according to the University of California study. The result is that they are ingesting and absorbing through their lips as much as 87 milligrams of product a day, the study says. Women are not only applying their lipsticks several times a day, but they also are doing this in the span of a whole lifetime, which means that exposure to lead and other heavy metals adds up and can potentially affect their health. One challenge for people wanting to avoid exposure is that none of the metals, with the exception of aluminum, are deliberately added to lipsticks and lip glosses. The metals are contaminants that are present in the pigments and base materials used to make the products. Because the metals are not ingredients, cosmetics companies are not required to list them on products' ingredient labels. The law regulating cosmetics passed Congress in 1938 and has never been updated. The FDA possesses no legal authority to make sure products are safe before they are sold. Nor is the agency empowered to pull dangerous products from store shelves. It's the Wild West for cosmetics companies, which have very few rules restricting chemical ingredients used in everything from shampoos to lotions to lipsticks. As the contamination of lip products with heavy metals makes it clear, allowing the industry to police itself is not the best idea. We need the FDA to be empowered by Congress and to take action so women won't face any health risks when they put on makeup. Cosmetics companies should be required to adhere to a standard for best manufacturing processes to limit metal contamination. For now, consumers should take precautions to protect themselves from heavy metal exposure from lip products. First, use less. If you find yourself reapplying lipstick 14 times a day, consider cutting back. Second, don't let children use lipstick, as their young bodies are especially vulnerable to toxic metals. Then let's get to work to make sure that by the time they've grown up, we have solved the problem of toxic chemicals in cosmetics.","Sharima Rasanayagam: Studies found higher level of lead in some lipsticks .

"Washington (CNN) -- In the past few weeks, we've seen a British soldier hacked to death with a meat cleaver on the streets of London and bombers blowing up spectators at the Boston Marathon. On the surface, terrorism is alive and well. So how should the United States react to these continuing threats? For the first time on Thursday, President Obama laid out the full scope of his proposed counterterrorism strategy, and it boiled down to this: George W. Bush's endless war on terror is over. And that's appropriate, since the enemy Bush went to war with after September 11 has largely been defeated. Obama's speech at the National Defense University in Washington was designed to lay the political groundwork to wind down America's longest war, the war that began when al Qaeda destroyed the World Trade Center and a wing of the Pentagon 12 years ago. Thursday's speech was the first time Obama had delivered an overarching framework for how to conceptualize the conflict that has defined U.S. national security policy since 9/11. Other speeches by Obama have focused on aspects of that conflict, such as Guantanamo and the Afghan war. But no speech has made such an expansive examination of the war against al Qaeda and its allies in all its manifestations, from drone strikes to detention policies to a clear-eyed assessment of the scope of the threats posed by al Qaeda and its affiliates, as well as by those ""homegrown"" extremists who attacked the Boston Marathon in April. Much of the coverage of the speech has centered on the measures the president outlined to impose greater constraints on CIA drone strikes and to try to hasten the eventual closing of Guantanamo. But the most significant aspect of the speech was the president's case that the ""perpetual wartime footing"" and ""boundless war on terror"" that has permeated so much of American life since 9/11 should come to an end. Obama argued that the time has come to redefine the kind of conflict that the United States is engaged in: ""We must define the nature and scope of this struggle, or else it will define us."" This is why the president focused part of his speech on a discussion of the seemingly arcane Authorization for the Use of Military Force that Congress passed days after 9/11 and that gave Bush the authority to go to war in Afghanistan against al Qaeda and its Taliban allies. Few, if any, in Congress who voted for the authorization understood at the time that they were voting for a virtual blank check that has provided the legal basis for more than a decade of war. It is a war that has expanded in recent years to other countries in the Middle East and Africa, such as Yemen and Somalia, where the U.S. has engaged in covert military operations against al Qaeda-affiliated groups. Theoretically, when U.S. combat troops finally withdraw from Afghanistan in December 2014, the authorization should simply expire, and the nation will no longer be at war. After all, once combat operations are over in Afghanistan, why would you want to keep in place an authorization for a permanent war? However, there are now some in Congress who would like to expand the scope of the Authorization for the Use of Military Force beyond its present parameters to include military operations against terrorist groups that were not involved in the 9/11 attacks, which could prolong America's wars indefinitely and add additional terrorist groups to the United States' list of enemies it is at war with. U.S. Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tennessee, ranking member of the influential Senate Foreign Relations Committee, for instance, last month called for an expansion of the scope of the authorization. Obama made it quite clear in his Thursday speech that he would oppose such an expansion, saying he hopes instead to ""ultimately repeal the AUMF's mandate. And I will not sign laws designed to expand this mandate further."" In short, Obama intends to end a seemingly endless war. That's because, according to Obama, ""the core of al Qaeda in Afghanistan and Pakistan is on the path to defeat. Their remaining operatives spend more time thinking about their own safety than plotting against us."" On Thursday, Obama asserted (in my view, correctly) that what remains of the terrorist threat, while significant and persistent, is nothing on the scale of the al Qaeda organization that launched the 9/11 operation and instead consists of ""less capable al Qaeda affiliates, threats to diplomatic facilities and businesses abroad, homegrown extremists."" These threats, the president further asserted, can be managed by carefully targeted drone strikes overseas and efforts to counter extremist ideology at home and do not require some kind of broader war. Obama is also looking to his legacy and the presidents who will follow him and is trying to begin to create the public consensus and legal framework that will help to ensure that the United States isn't ""drawn into more wars we don't need to fight, or continue to grant presidents unbound powers more suited for traditional armed conflicts between nation states."" Obama clearly hopes to leave office in 2016 as the commander in chief who finally ended America's longest war.","Terrorism has been in the news with Boston bombing and killing of UK soldier in the street .

"(CNN) -- Hillary Clinton's book rollout hit some speed bumps last week. She took some partisan heat for a comment that she recently made to ABC's Diane Sawyer. Clinton explained that she and her husband were ""dead broke"" when they left the White House because of the legal fees they faced. Her critics instantly jumped on the statement, pointing to these words as evidence that she was out of touch with average Americans. It could be seen as the first major gaffe in a campaign for president in 2016 that has not even begun. Her opponents argued that the statement was disingenuous, given the kind of money the Clintons have earned, and showed that she lacked a kind of veracity. As Robin Abcarian wrote in the Los Angeles Times: ""Here is an iron-clad rule of American politics: If you are a millionaire with multiple houses, never, under any circumstances, discuss your financial struggles. You don't have any financial struggles."" Clinton clarified the comment, saying she and Bill Clinton were ""obviously blessed"" and that ""I fully appreciate how hard life is so for many Americans today."" In another exchange that drew notice, an NPR interview with Terry Gross, the popular host of ""Fresh Air,"" Clinton was clearly testy and sharp when the host asked her why it took so long for her to come out in favor of same-sex marriage. Gaffes are a major part of the political game. Gaffes are moments when a candidate slips, and the slip explodes into a major story that might harm a candidacy. They have been a central feature in the age of televised campaigns since the 1960s. Reporters cover campaigns like horse races, more interested in the apparent ups and downs of each candidate than they are in the broader economic and political forces shaping elections or in the big public policy questions of the day. Gergen: Republicans play into Hillary's hands . Gaffes play well in this kind of coverage because they offer instances when it seems as if there will be a dramatic shift in which horse has the lead. As Jonathan Chait wrote in New York magazine: ""(S)ince very little changes in the horse race from day to day, the main device they (reporters) have to drive the narrative is the gaffe. The gaffe is a candidate saying something unplanned and unwelcome. As campaign reporters define their job, the gaffe is the primary form of 'news.'"" Clinton joins a long line of candidates who have made these kinds of mistakes. There are different kinds of gaffes, which is probably what helps make them interesting to some. There are gaffes where candidates make statements that just sound wrong, raising questions about their intelligence and political acumen. In 1967, the charismatic and dashing Michigan Gov. George Romney justified his initial support of Vietnam to a reporter as a result of ""brainwashing"" by the military during a visit to Vietnam. The statement, meant to explain the propaganda that many Americans had been hearing, came across as someone who lived in the world of movies rather than the world of politics. During a 1976 debate with Democrat Jimmy Carter, Republican President Gerald Ford said, ""There is no Soviet domination of Eastern Europe."" The statement was meant to show that the president didn't agree with conservative critics who said his foreign policy detente -- easing relations with the Soviet Union -- indicated an acceptance of communism. But it came off as if he didn't know much about foreign policy. Vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin made an endless series of these kinds of gaffes in television interviews in 2008 with Katie Couric, when she seemed to have trouble explaining some very basic facts about foreign or domestic policy. When Couric asked her about statements that Alaska's proximity to Russia was evidence of her foreign policy expertise, Palin said, ""Our next-door neighbors are foreign countries, there in the state that I am in the executive of."" She added, ""As Putin rears his head and comes into the airspace of the United States of America, where do they go? It's Alaska."" Then there are those gaffes where a candidate says something that just falls flat, even if it is not necessarily inaccurate. In 1988, Democratic candidate Michael Dukakis responded to a question about whether he would want the death penalty if his wife was raped and murdered. He said, ""I think you know that I've opposed the death penalty all of my life."" Although the Massachusetts governor was trying to demonstrate his commitment to this policy position, his response seemed cold and distant. In 2000, Vice President Al Gore claimed responsibility for having helped to invent the Internet. Republicans went to town, using this as evidence that Gore was willing to say anything, though the vice president was referring to his involvement with legislation that was actually vital in the evolution of modern communications technology. Sometimes a statement plays into negative perceptions that voters have about a candidate. At a supermarket visit during the 1992 campaign, George H.W. Bush's words made him appear stunned by a electronic scanner, conveying the impression that he was out of touch with average Americans. (The White House claimed he was just impressed with a new kind of scanner.) He also admitted during a debate that he didn't know the price of milk. When events change, a statement that seems reasonable at one moment can appear devastating the next. In 1972, Democrat George McGovern said that he was ""one thousand percent"" behind his running mate Thomas Eagleton, after Eagleton revealed that he had received electric shock treatment. But McGovern's team soon felt it was necessary to drop Eagleton from the ticket, making the statement seem quite problematic. Democrats pounced on Sen. John McCain in 2008 for saying that the fundamentals of the economy were sound as the financial markets imploded in the middle of the campaign. There are also physical gaffes, which are less about what candidates say than about how they look. When Democrat Edwin Muskie appeared to be crying as he responded to unfavorable stories about his wife in 1972, the perception of weakness seemed to harm his front-runner status. When Ford, a former college football player, stumbled on the stairs of an airplane, the fall became the butt of a joke on ""Saturday Night Live"" that came to symbolize his clumsiness. (Lyndon Johnson had always joked that Ford, then in the House, could not ""fart and chew gum at the same time."") When Dukakis wore a military helmet in a photo op, sitting in a tank, to show his support for the military, Republicans used this awkward image to highlight his weakness on defense. When Bush glanced at his watch in the middle of a debate with Bill Clinton in 1992, it showed a president who was not engaged with the entire campaign. When Vermont Gov. Howard Dean yelled enthusiastically after a third place finish in Iowa in 2004, the clip was shown again and again and used as evidence that he was somehow unstable. When Massachusetts Democrat John Kerry went windsurfing off Nantucket, with his sailboard twisting and turning different ways with the wind, Republicans played the image as evidence that he goes back and forth on the issues. ""John Kerry, whichever way the wind blows,"" the narrator says. In a 2000 debate, Gore's entire physical demeanor -- the way he walked toward George W. Bush at one point in the debate and frequently sighed -- conveyed a kind of arrogance that played into perceptions of him as an aloof East Coast liberal. There are also the gaffes when candidates are caught saying something that was not meant to be public. When an iPhone user captured Mitt Romney at a 2012 fund-raiser talking about the ""47%"" of Americans who were dependent on government and don't pay taxes and wouldn't support him, it was used as an example of his elitism. When Sen. George Allen of Virginia in 2006 used the racial slur a ""macaca"" while someone was taping him, some said it instantly tanked his candidacy. But do these gaffes really matter? Do they turn a campaign? According to a recent book by the political scientists John Sides and Lynn Vavreck, ""The Gamble,"" journalists tend to greatly overstate how important gaffes are. The fundamentals of campaigns -- the state of the economy, fund-raising capacity, endorsements -- are in the end much more important than moments like these, which seem big at the time. ""Many a news cycle,"" Sides wrote in his blog, ""was built on a 'gaffe' with a remarkably short shelf life."" When Barack Obama was recorded in the middle of the 2008 primaries making a statement about Americans who cling to their guns and religion, it stimulated a feeding frenzy but didn't kill his candidacy. Given the fast-paced nature of the modern press, the odds are that stories will die very quickly. So if a candidate can hold on long enough, the frenzy around a gaffe will probably disappear. The way in which gaffes usually matter has less to do with make-or-break moments than with how they help to build a broader narrative about how voters view a candidate. Gaffes become devastating only when they play into deeper weaknesses in a candidate that were there regardless of the missteps themselves. The gaffe can also become damaging as a very small piece of a larger story that Americans develop about a specific candidate. The biggest risk from a statement like Hillary Clinton's has to do with concerns about how genuine she is and whether she is more a product of Washington than Main Street. This will certainly be a story that her opponents will repeat in months to come. But, at this point, she shouldn't worry too much that this gaffe will matter. Usually candidates survive these stumbles. Clinton brings a tremendous amount to the table, in terms of her support among core Democrats and female voters and her experience in the White House, Senate and at the State Department. If she can continue to build on those assets and meld them into a first-rate campaign, this statement will be quickly forgotten.","Julian Zelizer: Hillary Clinton's comment about being ""dead broke"" landed with a thud .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- With no new video game consoles announced during the Electronic Entertainment Expo, the talk this week has been about the myriad of gaming choices players are going to have. From titles with huge blockbuster potential to independent offerings, game designers have broadened their imaginations to bring exciting entertainment choices. Yet, some of the most interesting games from E3 this year have an air of familiarity about them, like seeing an old friend again in a new way. 'Destiny' From the makers of ""Halo: Combat Evolved,"" Bungie introduces a universe where mankind is on the precipice of extinction and the players are the last hope of fending off a menace determined to end the human race. Utilizing an open-world concept, ""Destiny"" gives players the chance to explore a broken-down Earth with other players in single and cooperative missions. The game has some MMO elements built in, but the idea of exploring and charting your own course in a beautiful but deadly world is enticing. ""Destiny"" is scheduled for release in September for the PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, Xbox 360 and Xbox One. 'Evolve' On its surface, ""Evolve"" looks like a four-player cooperative game where the team seeks out and defeats fantastical monsters. The twist, however, is that boss monsters are also controlled by another player. This ""4 versus 1"" game mechanic encourages teamwork, planning and execution by the hunter players who try to kill the big baddie before they become the hunted. The player-character monsters are able to grow and evolve as the game progresses, giving them the opportunity to turn the tables on the other four. ""Evolve"" is scheduled for release in October for the PS4, XB1 and PC. 'Assassin's Creed: Unity' Set in turbulent 18th-century France, players are once again thrust into the role of an assassin charged with stopping the Templars, an ancient order bent on controlling the world. The seventh main title in the franchise now offers cooperative play, enabling three others from the Brotherhood of Assassins to join in your fight. Abilities and missions appear similar to past games, but the element of cooperative play creates the need for teamwork, strategy and some really cool moments. The group is still likely to be outnumbered in many of the quests, yet their unique abilities should get them through to the goal. ""Assassin's Creed: Unity"" is scheduled for release in October for the PS4, XB1 and PC. 'Halo: The Master Chief Collection' In preparation for the release of a new ""Halo"" title next year, Microsoft is giving players a chance to relive or discover for the first time the genesis of one of the most iconic characters for the Xbox, the space marine known only as ""Master Chief."" ""Halo: The Master Chief Collection"" puts all four major ""Halo"" games together, remastered and playable in a seamless way to experience the franchise as one very long adventure. While the older games' graphics have been updated, there is also the option to enjoy theme the way they were originally designed. That includes some of the unintentional bugs that players found and used to their advantage. The collection is jammed with maps, multiplayer options and iconic weapons, all aimed toward the ""Halo 5: Guardians"" title coming in 2015. ""Halo: The Master Chief Collection"" is scheduled for release in November exclusively for the Xbox One. 'LittleBigPlanet 3' A universe full of whimsy and imagination. Fantastical creatures of all shapes, sizes and abilities. Levels created by the brain power of millions of people around the world. Oh, and now you have friends. Sackboy is back in ""LittleBigPlanet 3"" from a new developer, Sumo Digital, and he's brought some help to solve new challenging levels. Oddsock, Toggle and Swoop help as the well-known stuffed yarn boy makes his way through new multiplayer action spanning all 8.7 million user-generated levels in the Little Big Planet universe. ""LittleBigPlanet 3"" is scheduled for release this November exclusively for the PlayStation 4. 'No Man's Sky' This entry from independent game company Hello Games puts players in a vast universe that game designers themselves have described as infinite. Huge beautiful worlds, where dinosaurs exist alongside modern technology, are at the player's fingertips to explore. This science-fiction story is designed so that no two players will have the same experience even though they will be in the same universe. Every player starts on a different planet, making the potential unique gameplay nearly endless. ""No Man's Sky"" does not have an announced release date, but it is exclusive to the PS4 at launch, with Xbox and PC coming later.. 'Splatoon' From the fantastic to the hilarious, ""Splatoon"" lets you become a transformative squid, shooting ink and battling in 4 versus 4 territorial combat. The idea is to cover the battlefield in your team's color while the opposing team tries to do the same. Switching from an ink-shooting person to a squid creature, players can quickly travel in the ink of their team to reach destinations quickly. It is competitive, but in a friendly way, as players race the clock toward victory. ""Splatoon"" will be available in 2015 for the Nintendo Wii U. 'Super Smash Bros.' Pac-Man joins an all-star cast in the new competitive fighting game, ""Super Smash Bros."" Like others in the series, players can choose from iconic video game characters to do battle in 4 versus 4 action. Two versions of the game are planned for release, one for the Wii U and one for the handheld 3DS console. There are exclusive features for each, but the addition of new characters and Mii fighters (Nintendo avatars that represent the player themselves) should give fans and newcomers many hours of entertainment. The 3DS version is schedule for release in October, while the Wii U version will come out during the 2014 holiday season. 'Batman: Arkham Knight' The Dark Knight returns to gaming consoles and has a new tool in his war on crime in Gotham City. A revamped and upgraded Batmobile offers players new ways to take down bad guys, travel the city and generally strike a new kind of fear in the hearts of criminals. More than just a means of transportation, the Batmobile feels like a separate character helping Batman during hand-to-hand combat, taking on larger opponents or acting as a distraction to allow the Caped Crusader access to new areas. While still perpetually dark, Gotham looks more inviting this time around and opens up new gameplay choices and style options as the adventure progresses. ""Batman: Arkham Knight"" is scheduled for release in 2015 for the PS4, XB1 and PC. OK, gamers. We know we didn't include everything.

"(CNN) -- Ever since the Trayvon Martin case came to national attention, George Zimmerman has been described by some as having racially profiled the 17-year-old before he was shot and killed. There's a difference of opinion about whether racial profiling was actually involved, but a key question that is often overlooked is the distinction between profiling by a citizen and profiling by a member of law enforcement. That distinction is likely to be crucial in determining the direction the case may go. As a criminal defense attorney for more than 30 years, I can't even begin to recall how many cases my firm has handled that involved challenging law enforcement officers for the practice of stopping or searching an individual based on what is typically referred to as racial profiling. Essentially, racial profiling occurs when race, national origin or ethnicity is the primary or sole consideration used by an officer of the law when intervening in a law enforcement capacity. Racial profiling is a form of discrimination that is not only despicable, but also is an illegal and improper basis for any police officer to stop, search, arrest or investigate another person. The issue of racial profiling has been bandied about often in discussions of Martin's shooting. As with many things concerning the case, much misinformation has circulated. Zimmerman was not a law enforcement agent. He was a civilian, operating under different legal standards than those applied to the police. Merely because he was a neighborhood watch captain does not attach law enforcement status to him. Tape showed Zimmerman's anger over black man's beating . It has been reported that he acquired a concealed weapon permit, which legally allowed him to conceal the gun that was used to shoot and kill Martin. Hence, although Zimmerman was possibly negligent, irresponsible and exercised poor judgment, it was not illegal for him to follow Martin, carry a gun when doing so or even ignore the opinion of the civilian 911 dispatcher when advised, regarding his following Martin, ""OK, we don't need you to do that."" The only legal relevance as to whether race was the determining factor in the following and killing of Martin was whether it goes to establish if Zimmerman exercised a ""depraved mind"" regarding the killing. This requisite depravity is a necessary element for second-degree murder in Florida, the crime for which Zimmerman has been charged. If racism or bigotry can be established as the basis for killing Martin, then a second-degree murder charge could be appropriate. However, with the evidence that has emerged, especially that contained within the discovery documents released in recent days, proof of a racial motive concerning the shooting seems wholly lacking. Opinion: What to take away from the death of Trayvon Martin . Even if a racial aspect was among the factors that led Zimmerman to be suspicious of Martin and follow him, the law regarding what a civilian may do when following another person was not necessarily broken. Is it racial profiling for a black man to avoid going into a biker bar at night in a small rural town? Is it racial profiling for a white person to refuse to take a stroll through housing projects in a large urban city at midnight?. The biker bar and the projects both undoubtedly are filled with people who are racially colorblind, but most would assume that some might not be. Is it racial profiling or life's cumulative experiences and knowledge or simply common sense that would cause one to formulate an opinion? A civilian standard of profiling is much different legally than that applied to a law enforcement officer. A civilian, as offensive as it may be, is allowed to personally act on biases or prejudices, whereas a law enforcement officer is prohibited from doing so. From the first press reports, I believed the shooting was racially motivated. If so, life in prison would be wholly appropriate as a punishment upon conviction. However, research, investigation and learning the facts caused me to reverse this earlier opinion. The apparent absence of reported previous acts of bigotry, the statements from family and friends indicating Zimmerman wasn't prejudiced, being raised in a multiracial family and having many ethnically diverse friends (which standing alone would be irrelevant but relevant to me when taken in totality with these other indicators), his mentoring of two black youth over a couple of years at his own expense and doing so without fanfare or attention and a review of prior calls and the 911 call indicating race wasn't the basis of the call are some of the reasons for reassessing my original opinion. Moreover, documents released in the case indicate Zimmerman had previously expressed concern and was critical of the Sanford, Florida, police for the way they treated a case involving the beating of a homeless black man when they didn't arrest the white defendant immediately. (A lawyer in my firm represented the defendant in that case, who was the son of a Sanford police officer.) There is a question about whether George Zimmerman primarily called the police to report suspicious activity of young black men. If true, this is quite troubling. But before its relevance could be fully determined, an analysis would need to be made of each call to determine the ratio of calls made relative to blacks, whites and Hispanics, whether other strangers who weren't black were ever seen in the complex and not called on and whether unknown black men were ever seen in the complex and the police not called. It would also be relevant to determine whether the race of the suspects in the rash of burglaries that had previously occurred in the complex were ever identified. Too much speculation has surrounded this tragedy and I think it important to fully evaluate such matters before conclusions are reached. Barring new facts or possibly a more detailed analysis of Zimmerman's previous calls, there doesn't appear to be any evidence or support for the supposition that bigotry or prejudice played a role in Zimmerman's shooting of Martin . This doesn't mean Martin had to die. Would Zimmerman have been so bold if he wasn't carrying a gun? Likely not, and I've argued before that gun laws need to be reviewed in light of this case. This was the inevitable deadly consequence when an altercation occurred and a gun was legally allowed to be in a public place. Without establishing that the killing was racially motivated, any claim that Zimmerman committed second-degree murder in shooting Martin will not survive. Interestingly, the state in its charging affidavit simply claimed Zimmerman ""profiled"" Martin, not that he racially profiled him. This allows the state to keep such a claim open-ended, likely knowing early on that it couldn't sustain the burden of proving racial profiling. More and more, this case looks like it will be thrown out in criminal court and eventually be headed to civil court. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Mark NeJame.","Mark NeJame: Many have said George Zimmerman engaged in racial profiling .
He says civilians aren't subject to same restrictions as police officers face .
Evidence doesn't support the claim that his actions were racially motivated, NeJame says .

"(CNN) -- A year earlier than usual, the nation's largest teachers union on Monday endorsed President Barack Obama for re-election in 2012. The National Education Association, which represents 3.2 million teachers and administrators, approved the recommendation from its political action committee at its annual meeting in Chicago. Obama ""shares our vision for a stronger America,"" NEA President Dennis Van Roekel said in a statement issued by the group. ""He has never wavered from talking about the importance of education or his dedication to a vibrant middle class."" Since taking office in 2009, Obama has championed education reform and used stimulus money to help keep teachers employed. Now he is calling for maintaining or increasing spending on education despite negotiating federal budget cuts. However, not all of the Obama administration's education policies have pleased the union, particularly its support for charter schools and continued reliance on standardized testing to assess performance. The NEA statement said the organization usually waits until the summer of an election year to endorse a candidate. This year, it did so earlier than normal ""in order to provide early and strong support to help ensure the election of a candidate who is on the side of students and working families."" Calling a conservative swing in state legislatures and the November 2010 congressional elections ""eye-opening,"" Van Roekel said the nation ""cannot sacrifice our students' futures by shortchanging them now."" ""There are two very distinct visions for this country,"" Van Roekel said in the statement. ""One is about opportunities for all and one is not."" Vice President Joe Biden addressed the meeting on Sunday and pledged continued support for public education. Biden cited anti-union efforts by Republican governors in Wisconsin and other states who blamed benefits for school teachers as a cause of their budget deficits. ""We should working with you, not against you,"" Biden said to applause. ""We should be listening to you, not lecturing to you. We should be embracing you, not pushing you aside. You are not the problem."" He concluded by telling the NEA delegates that they ""should have no doubt about my affection for you and the president's commitment to you.""

"Jakarta, Indonesia (CNN) -- A restless volcano in northern Indonesia erupted Friday, spewing clouds of ash as high as 2 kilometers into the sky, the country's National Disaster Management Agency said. The authorities are warning residents to stay away from the volcano, Mt. Lokon, in North Sulawesi, said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the disaster management agency. A 2.5 kilometer exclusion zone had already been set up around Mt. Lokon, which had been showing signs of activity in recent days. A series of eruptions by Mt. Lokon in July prompted the evacuation of thousands of local residents. The volcano also erupted in October and December. Indonesia is located on the ""Ring of Fire,"" an arc of fault lines circling the Pacific Basin that is prone to frequent earthquakes and volcanic eruptions.","Indonesian authorities are warning people to stay away from Mt.

"(CNN) -- A volcanic eruption in Iceland forced flight cancellations and the closure of airspace over the country's four international airports, an official said Sunday. ""There are no international flights in or out of Iceland at this time,"" Keflavik International Airport spokeswoman Hjordis Gudmunsdottir said. Officials will reassess the situation at midnight Sunday (8 p.m. EDT), she added. There was ""no impact on European or transatlantic flights"" after the Grimsvotn volcano's eruption, and none was expected on Sunday, Europe's umbrella air traffic control association Eurocontrol said. Ash is expected to reach Scotland on Tuesday and could enter France and Spain on Thursday, Eurocontrol said. Last year, another Icelandic eruption, of the volcano Eyjafjallajokull, attracted worldwide attention after its ash cloud disrupted air travel across Europe. Weather patterns this weekend have been very different from the northerly winds that swept through the region after last year's eruption, a spokeswoman for the official United Kingdom weather agency said. But she said the ash cloud's movement is difficult to predict. Ash could reach the United Kingdom and northern continental Europe Wednesday, she said. The Grimsvotn volcano under the Vatnajokull glacier erupted Saturday, according to the Icelandic Meteorological Office. A dark cloud of smoke rose from the glacier, and scientists flew over the scene to evaluate the event, according to CNN affiliate TV2 Iceland. The last eruption of the volcano was in 2004, TV2 Iceland reported. ""It is important for people to know that not all of Iceland is covered in ash,"" Gudmunsdottir said. Sitrun Kapitola, manager of the Islandia Hotel Nupar, which is close to Saturday's eruption, said she could see a cloud of smoke over the mountains, and ash was falling around the hotel. Police were telling her and others that there was no need to evacuate and there was nothing to fear, Kapitola said. ""We see it very well,"" she said. Tourists at the hotel were excited to see the eruption, watching the events unfold while eating dinner, she said. ""It happens every 10 years,"" she said. ""It mostly produces water."" Grimsvotn is Iceland's most frequently active volcano. In 1783, a 16.7-mile fissure system from the volcano produced the world's largest known historical lava flow over a seven-month period, damaging crops and livestock, according to the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History. A resulting famine resulted in the loss of one-fifth of Iceland's population, according to the Smithsonian website. ""It's nothing compared to the other one,"" she added, referring to last year's dramatic eruption of the Eyjafjallajokull. CNN's Andreena Narayan, David Wilkinson, Brian Walker, Marilia Brocchetto, Aliza Kassim and Michael Martinez contributed to this report.","NEW: The ash will reach Scotland on Tuesday, Europe's umbrella air traffic control association says .

"(CNN) -- An ash cloud from a Chilean volcano is disrupting air travel in Australia and New Zealand once again, airlines said Wednesday. ""Volcanic ash from the eruption of the Puyehue Cordon Caulle volcano in Chile continues to cause flight disruptions to the Qantas network,"" the airline said in a statement. ""At Qantas safety is our first priority and a number of flights have been canceled or rerouted to avoid the volcanic ash cloud."" Qantas and Jetstar suspended Wednesday flights to and from Queenstown, Christchurch and Wellington. Qantas flights between Sydney and Buenos Aires are delayed. The June 4 eruption of the volcano in the Chilean Andes mountains sent plumes of smoke more than six miles into the air. The ash cloud forced the shutdown of flights in and out of several Australian cities last week. Chile is on the so-called ""Ring of Fire,"" an arc of volcanoes and fault lines circling the Pacific Basic that is prone to frequent earthquakes and volcanic eruptions.","Ash cloud from Chilean volcano is affecting parts of Pacific region .

"Berlin (CNN) -- The peak of a cloud of volcanic ash that forced the cancellation of hundreds of flights has passed, Iceland's prime minister said Wednesday. ""The worst is over,"" Prime Minister Johanna Siguroardottir said. ""And now the clean-up can begin. Our geoscientists say that the eruption is waning day by day and that the problems arising in our neighboring countries as a result of volcanic ash should be resolved quickly."" According to the Icelandic Meteorological Office, the eruption of the Grimsvotn volcano ""paused"" at 2:40 a.m. Wednesday (10:40 p.m. Tuesday ET), meaning it was not erupting at the moment. The agency warned, however, that it could begin again, and that only after three months with no eruptions will the volcano be considered dormant. Meanwhile, some German airports were reopened Wednesday after cancellations due to the cloud of volcanic ash. Bremen has reopened and Hamburg is allowing takeoffs and landings, according to Deutsche Flugsicherung, the German aviation safety agency. Airports in Berlin will resume flights at 2 p.m. local time ( 8 a.m. ET). The closures affected at least 600 flights in Germany, authorities said. Poland could be affected later in the day, the European air traffic control agency Eurocontrol said. PrzemysBaw Przybylski, the spokesman for the Chopin airport in Warsaw, said as of Wednesday afternoon flights into Warsaw were still being accepted. But the ash cloud is dissipating and much of the rest of European air travel is expected to be running normally Wednesday, the agency said. A portion of the ash from Saturday's eruption in Iceland had spread over Britain by Tuesday afternoon, with the cloud reaching London's Heathrow airport around lunchtime, a computer model indicated. Eurocontrol reported about 500 flights in British airspace were canceled Tuesday. Heathrow alone normally operates about 1,300 flights a day, and Europe as a whole has about 29,000 daily, according to Eurocontrol. The Grimsvotn eruption came about 13 months after Iceland's Eyjafjallajokull volcano belched smoke and ash into the skies over the continent, forcing the cancellation of thousands of flights per day at the peak of the problem. The ash can be a serious hazard to aircraft, reducing visibility, damaging flight controls and ultimately causing jet engines to fail. Grimsvotn's eruption was more than 10 times larger and put more ash into the air in 36 hours than last year's burst did in a month, University of Iceland geophysicist Magnus Tumi Gudmundsson told CNN Tuesday -- but the main eruption is now over, he said. Disruptions from the larger eruption are likely to be smaller than they were in 2010, said Gillian Foulger, a geophysicist at Britain's Durham University. Most of the ash is blowing northwest, toward sparsely populated Greenland, and the European aviation industry collected valuable safety data during last year's event. ""It's much better able to set the safety thresholds accurately, so I think things are probably going to turn out very well for us,"" Foulger said. Airlines have been making the case that it is safe to fly through ash clouds of medium density, Britain's Civil Aviation Authority said Tuesday. Carriers including British Airways, Virgin and EasyJet are now free to fly through clouds of up to 4,000 micrograms per cubic meter if they feel it is safe to do so, Richard Taylor of the CAA told CNN. Grimsvotn lies beneath Iceland's Vatnajokull glacier, a sheet of ice more than three times the size of the U.S. state of Rhode Island -- larger than any on mainland Europe. Grimsvotn is the country's most active volcano and last erupted in 2004, according to the Icelandic Meteorological Office. ""If history is any guide, we expect the next eruption to be in five to six years,"" said the agency's Jakobsdottir on Wednesday. In 1783, a 16.7-mile fissure system from the volcano produced the world's largest known historical lava flow over a seven-month period, damaging crops and livestock, according to the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History. A resulting famine led to the death of one-fifth of Iceland's population, according to the museum.

"(CNN) -- There is a striking contrast between the issues being discussed at the climate talks in Cancun, Mexico, this week, and news reports of the views voiced by some of the incoming freshmen to the House of Representatives. In Cancun, where the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change conference will be meeting until Friday, there are talks about targets for emissions cuts, the role of deforestation and the effect on climate if we continue with a business-as-usual approach on emissions. Meanwhile, in Washington, D.C., some new members the new congressional intake have expressed either disbelief or ignorance about how humans influence climate change. Both sets of discussions are mired in seemingly intractable political and economic issues. However, in both environments, science can play an important role in breaking the logjam. Policymakers are used to the complexity of  balancing different interests or shaping economic policy, but they aren't generally very familiar with the complexities of atmospheric science. These matter because actions that policymakers can take -- whether on raising vehicle mileage standards, promoting rural electrification in Asia or mandating renewable energy portfolios for power generation -- don't just have positive impacts for climate. They can also produce on-the-ground effects that citizens (and voters) can readily appreciate: reduced air pollution and smog, improved public health and strengthened ecosystems and water resources. These co-benefits occur through the actions of atmospheric chemistry and wind patterns and via the physics of such things as how clouds form and how soot falling on snow can change the way the sun's rays are reflected. But while these effects are complex, scientists can now more comprehensively assess the environmental effect for any specific policy that is suggested. Unfortunately, the agencies and organizations that bring the science of climate to the attention of policymakers (like the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change or the National Academies) have too often focused on science that is interesting to scientists, rather than the science that would be of most use to policymakers. This is beginning to change, and far more people in the scientific community are now on board with the idea that science can directly answer questions that policymakers are interested in. New initiatives from the American Geophysical Union or individual groups of scientists can help provide access to that information more efficiently than the multiyear assessment bodies. Indeed, since many scientists are publicly funded, part of our mission is to make our expertise available to the wider society. Many of those scientists even live in the same districts or states as the new representatives and can perhaps usefully communicate across a perceived partisan divide. Here are two examples of how more appropriate science can help make better policy: . â¢ Recent work from NASA has shown that reductions in tailpipe emissions from cars and trucks in the United States, resulting from a shift toward more plugin-hybrid vehicles, would help the climate by reducing emissions of carbon dioxide, ozone precursors and soot particles (three of the main drivers of global warming). But ozone and soot are also big contributors to smog and its noxious effect on health, and reductions can also have immediate benefits on local populations. â¢ In Asia, using coal and biomass in homes for heating or cooking are important factors in creating the ""atmospheric brown cloud"" that is damaging the health of Chinese and Indian populations, and causing changes in temperature and rainfall. Climate policy initiatives that tackle these issues provide incentives at both the large, regional scale of China and India and  the small scale affecting congressional districts. My point is not that if policymakers knew more science they would all agree on measures to deal with global warming. This would be naive. Rather, it is that by appreciating more of the nuances, they will be able to find paths forward that reflect their priorities and values and help improve the climate outlook, too. The freshman congressional caucus was elected on a promise to end business as usual in Washington. With help, they might be able to end business as usual on climate-changing emissions, too. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Gavin Schmidt.","Gavin Schmidt: There's a gulf between Cancun climate goals, views of some new to Congress .
It would help if scientists could show link between climate change, voters' lives, he says .
He says scientists are increasingly aware of need to explain this link to policymakers .

"(CNN) -- The number of states under heat advisories diminished to 15 Tuesday evening. Dangerous heat is expected across parts of northern Texas through Thursday evening, according to the National Weather Service.  Dallas, Fort Worth, Arlington and other areas will experience afternoon heat indices of 105 degrees or more through Thursday. Other states still sweltering under heat advisories include Oklahoma, Louisiana, Arkansas, Missouri, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Tennessee, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina and Virginia. Many Tennesseans should expect the heat index to be between 110 and 114 degrees for the rest of the week, according to the National Weather Service. ""I just had to stop once in a while and catch a breath, it was just that tough to breathe,"" said Marion, Illinois, resident Ceasar Maragni, who opted to stay inside Tuesday after a swampy Monday evening trip to the Williamson County Fair. Even the frozen lemonade vendor was lagging with few customers in the nearly 100-degree evening heat, he said. Other areas of the country not under heat advisories touted new record highs Tuesday. Newark, New Jersey, broke its previous record of 98, set in 1966, when it hit 99 degrees. JFK Airport and Islip, New York, did the same, reporting 97 and 93 degrees respectively, beating 1993 records of 94 degrees at JFK and 91 in Islip. In central Oklahoma, temperatures in some places shot past the 100 mark for the 14th consecutive day Tuesday. Highs in much of the state are likely to flirt with triple-digits for almost another week, according to the National Weather Service. High demand for water amid the heat wave and problems with soil shrinking as the ground warms has resulted in burst pipes and low water pressure in Oklahoma City, prompting officials to issue mandatory water-use restrictions for the first time in at least a decade, according to utilities department spokeswoman Debbie Ragan. More than 200 people have suffered from heat-related emergencies in Tulsa and Oklahoma City since June 17, when the agency issued its first heat alert, said Lara O'Leary, spokeswoman for the Emergency Medical Services Authority of Oklahoma. The heat has been so extreme that a portion of the Cimarron Turnpike in Pawnee County, Oklahoma, buckled on Sunday, creating a 2-foot ramp that sent a motorcyclist flying 150 feet through the air. In addition to the discomfort and potential danger, the heat could wreak havoc on crops, especially corn, said Chad Hart, assistant professor of agricultural economics at Iowa State University. The heat wave comes at a sensitive time for corn, he said. ""That's why markets are watching the heat wave. We're entering a period of time when corn pollinates, and so if you get a heat wave in the early- to mid-part of July across Iowa, Illinois and Indiana, it can have a big impact,"" he said. ""The last time we had a big heat wave and drought was in 1988, and that year we saw corn production fall off by over 30% ... so if we think of where we are today with already-high corn prices, a true drought scenario can push prices to highs we've never seen before."" Temperatures will return to nearly normal summertime levels by Wednesday throughout the Northeast, said Chris Vaccaro, a spokesman for the National Weather Service. High pressure over the Plains is keeping the weather pattern stable, allowing heat to build and expand up the Eastern Seaboard. A cooler, dryer weather system is nibbling at the northern edges of the heat wave, threatening to exchange high temperatures for potentially dangerous thunderstorms, according to forecasters. There's not quite so much relief in store for residents of the lower Midwest and South. ""This has been going on all weekend and will continue into this week,"" Vaccaro said. In Oklahoma City, forecasters are calling for nearly another full week of temperatures near or above 100 degrees, threatening to break a 1936 record for 22 consecutive days of such heat. Nighttime will bring little solace. While record- and near-record daytime highs are being set, many areas are also experiencing record warm lows at night. For instance, the low temperature of 83 recorded early Tuesday in North Little Rock, Arkansas, set a new record for the warmest low in July, Vaccaro said. Warm nights are a problem for people without air conditioning, he said. ""If you're exposed to the outside elements, your body can't cool down at night,"" he said. The heat has already claimed at least one victim, a 51-year-old man in Granite City, Illinois, who died Sunday because of the excessive heat, according to the Madison County coroner. Mitsunari Uechi was found unresponsive in his mobile home, where the air conditioning was not working. Police described the residence as ""extremely hot,"" Coroner Stephen Nonn said in a written statement. Several high-temperature records have been broken recently. Wichita, Kansas, hit 111 degrees Sunday. The National Weather Service says temperatures of 111 degrees have occurred there only 10 times since July 1888. Forecasters say people should limit outdoor activity during the hottest portions of the day, wear lightweight clothing, drink plenty of water and be watchful for signs of heat exhaustion, which include heavy sweating, pale and clammy skin, weak pulse, fainting and vomiting. CNN's Monica O'Connor, Meteorologist Jacqui Jeras, Ed Payne, Karen Smith and Chelsea Bailey contributed to this report.","The National Weather Service has taken down heat advisories in some states .

"Washington (CNN) -- The National Security Agency doesn't have access to servers run by Internet giants Google and Yahoo, its chief said in a pushback to a Washington Post report that the U.S. spy network taps into overseas data links to slurp up millions of text, video and audio records every day. But Gen. Keith Alexander's comments at a cybersecurity conference Wednesday don't appear to address the substance of the newspaper's allegations -- that the NSA has found a way to tap into the data as it moves between servers around the world without many of the restrictions imposed by U.S. law and court oversight. Asked about the report by a Bloomberg Television reporter who interviewed him on stage at the conference, Alexander denied breaking into servers or databases run by Internet companies. ""Not to my knowledge,"" he said in response to a question about tapping into company databases. ""It would be illegal for us to do that. So, I don't know what the report is,"" Alexander said. ""But I can tell you factually we do not have access to Google servers, Yahoo servers. We go through a court order."" However, the allegations published by The Post -- based on documents leaked by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden -- aren't that the NSA has hacked into data centers or databases owned by the companies. Instead, the newspaper -- citing the Snowden documents and unnamed ""knowledgeable officials"" -- reported that the NSA gets access to the data as it passes through vulnerable points overseas on its way to databases around the world. According to The Post, the NSA and the British Government Communications Headquarters found a way to exploit a weakness in Internet architecture to copy data as it moves from the public Internet into data centers maintained by the companies. The agency then uses custom-built software to decode the companies' internal data formats and filter the resulting data for information it wants to collect, the newspaper reported. The material collected under the program -- code-named MUSCULAR -- includes e-mail addressing information, as well as ""content such as text, audio and video,"" according to The Post. The agency's Fort Meade, Maryland, headquarters received 181,280,466 such records in the 30 days preceding the top-secret January 9, 2013, accounting on which The Post's report is based, according to the newspaper. In a statement, the NSA said ""the assertion that we collect vast quantities of U.S. persons' data from this type of collection is also not true."" ""NSA applies Attorney General-approved processes to protect the privacy of U.S. persons,"" the agency said. It's unclear how much of the material collected involves what the NSA calls ""U.S. persons,"" a category that includes U.S. citizens, permanent residents, groups predominantly made up of those groups and businesses incorporated in the United States. But unlike domestic programs that fall under restrictions imposed by law and the oversight of a secret court, surveillance conducted overseas falls under an executive order with less restrictive standards, The Post reported. The report raised concerns from Google and Yahoo, with the Internet behemoths saying they never gave the NSA permission to access communication links to their servers. ""We have strict controls in place to protect the security of our data centers, and we have not given access to our data centers to the NSA or to any other government agency,"" said Yahoo spokeswoman Sarah Meron. Google has ""long been concerned about the possibility of this kind of snooping, which is why we have continued to extend encryption across more and more Google services and links,"" said David Drummond, Google's chief legal officer. ""We do not provide any government, including the U.S. government, with access to our systems. We are outraged at the lengths to which the government seems to have gone to intercept data from our private fiber networks, and it underscores the need for urgent reform."" The newspaper report emerged a day after Alexander and James Clapper, the director of national intelligence, testified before a House committee reviewing the agency's surveillance activities. The hearing, billed as a discussion of potential changes to the 35-year-old Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, commonly known as FISA, came after a report by the German magazine Der Spiegel that the NSA monitored German Chancellor Angela Merkel's cell phone. Some reports also suggest the United States carried out surveillance on French and Spanish citizens. Jim Sciutto reported from Washington; Chelsea J. Carter reported and wrote from Atlanta. CNN's Jeremy Harlan contributed to this report.","Gen. Keith Alexander says the NSA doesn't break into Google, Yahoo databases .

"(CNN) -- You might expect Sunday to be a day of rest in a predominantly Roman Catholic country like Brazil. But the World Cup offers as good a reason as it gets to make an exception. There will be three contests -- in Brasilia, Porte Alegre and Rio de Janeiro -- on what will be the fourth day of the prestigious football tournament. Each of them pits a team from Europe against one from Latin America. Here's a look at a few things to watch for: . Spotlight on Lionel Messi . Lionel Messi is one of a kind. At 26 years old, all he's done is win four consecutive FIFA Ballons d'Or, given annually to football's best player. And he's done it on one of the best club teams, Barcelona, in the world. But on the sport's biggest stage, Messi has yet to deliver. On Sunday, when his Argentine team faces Bosnia and Herzegovina, Messi will get another chance at a World Cup title. Many see this tournament as his best opportunity yet, given that he is in his prime and the event is being held in his native South America. France copes without Franck . Going into this year's World Cup, many tapped France as a favorite. The biggest reason: Franck Ribery. He was the best player on the world's best club team, Bayern Munich in 2013 -- when it won the Bundesliga and even more prestigious Champions League. As such, there was good reason to think Ribery could help lead his native France to the promised land. Until, that is, the 31-year-old was ruled out of the World Cup due to back issues. So does that mean France is out of contention? We might get a good gauge on that answer Sunday, when Les Bleus open Group E play with a matchup against Honduras. Are you ready, Rio? Rio de Janiero is two years away from welcoming the world, as the host of the 2016 Summer Olympics. What better way to warm up than with the Olympics' closest competition for the world's biggest sporting event? World Cup play kicks off in Rio on Sunday, with the Messi-led Argentinian squad facing off with Bosnia and Herzegovina. That means thousands of Cariocas (a reference to Rio residents) will pack into the iconic Maracana stadium; the even luckier ones, someone might argue, could be on the city's world-famous beaches, like Ipanema and Copacabana. Whatever excitement there is Sunday, though, should pale in comparison to what unfolds on Sunday, July 13, in the same stadium. That's when the World Cup final takes place. And -- if Brazilians' prayers are answers -- the host team will be there, slugging it out for the championship. Latin American teams are rolling . Europe boasts being the birthplace of football. But this year, Latin America has not only hosted the World Cup, it's virtually owned it -- with Brazil, Mexico, Chile, Colombia and Costa Rica having won their tournament openers. The only Latin team that didn't win was Uruguay. That's because it got beat by Costa Rica. Plus, it can always take solace in the fact it won its last World Cup in Brazil, albeit 64 years ago. Latin American teams will get three more chances to continue their run Sunday: starting with Ecuador against Switzerland, then with Honduras taking on France, and, lastly, with the Argentina matchup. A new country, a real chance . Twenty-five years ago, Bosnia and Herzegovina didn't exist. In the years after its 1991 declaration of independence from Yugoslavia, it was more or less a war zone. Peace came later in the 1990s, paved by the Dayton Agreement. So did some normalcy. And, with that, so did football -- including a fledgling national team that seemed to get better as the years went by. Bosnia and Herzegovina narrowly missed out on a 2010 World Cup berth. This time, it will try to get out of a group that includes Argentina, Nigeria and Iran. Slated as 21st in the FIFA world rankings -- just behind Mexico and ahead of other World Cup contenders like Algeria, Ivory Coast and Ecuador -- Bosnia is looking to make history not just by showing up, but by advancing. As coach Safet Susic said -- according to the broadcaster B92, as reported by Bleacher Report: ""We are not going to Brazil simply as tourists or to take notes. We want to succeed.""","Argentina's Lionel Messi will take the field for the first time in Brazil .
Bosnia and Herzegovina will start play in its first World Cup .
Action starts in Rio de Janeiro -- host of the World Cup finals, the 2016 Olympics ."

Spin the globe, and you're bound to land by one of the top romantic islands. From the Mediterranean to the Indian Ocean, they share the powerful ingredient of fantasy. There's nothing like escaping to an island with your loved one to bring out starry eyes in the most jaded traveler. Discover the getaway escape that's right for you two castaways among these top islands for romance. 1. Bora-Bora, French Polynesia . What could be more seductive than an overwater bungalow above a turquoise lagoon? That's the essence of Bora-Bora, a geographically blessed sliver of French Polynesia. At its heart lies the jagged peak of Mount Otemanu; on its fringes, tiny motus (islets) and a coral reef with a swirl of colorful marine life. Travel + Leisure: World's Best Airlines . Room to Book: Villas 103 to 110 at the St. Regis Bora Bora Resort have private decks with whirlpools and outdoor showers. Table for Two: Order the poisson cru (a local take on ceviche) at the sand-floored Bora Kaina Hut. Don't Miss: A private snorkeling trip with Diveasy Bora Bora, whose divemasters get you up close and personal with moray eels and giant manta rays. 2. Capri, Italy . Known for its limestone cliffs and waterfront villas, this 4-square-mile speck in the Tyrrhenian Sea fully embraces the concept of la dolce vita. (For proof, look to the afternoon crowds stretched out on the rocks and sipping Prosecco at the glamorous La Fontelina beach club.) A funicular railway whisks visitors from the main port to the boutique-lined streets of Capri town; privacy-seekers keep heading upward by foot or bus to the quieter village of Anacapri. There, stroll through the gardens of the 19th-century Villa San Michele with only ivy-covered statues for company. Room to Book: No. 2 at J. K. Place Capri for a roomy terrace and dreamlike water views. Table for Two: Sign up for a cooking lesson at the agriturismo TerraMMare, where you'll make, and then dine on, traditional island recipes. Don't Miss: The nightly passeggiata, when well-heeled Italians glide through the streets at sunset before settling in at a bar on the piazza to watch the action unfold. 3. Santorini, Greece . If there were ever a place that could get by on its looks, it would be Santorini. Whitewashed cave houses framed by bougainvillea and backed by blue-domed churches spill down the rim of an ancient volcanic crater; at sunset, the Sea of Crete is bathed in a rosy glow. Yet as compelling as the scenery may be, Santorini's true appeal lies in its wealth of diversions: extraordinary wines, black (or red or white) beaches and archaeological sites from the prehistoric era. Travel + Leisure: Best Secret Beaches on Earth . Room to Book: The Perivolas Suite at Perivolas hotel, whose cliffside terrace seems to hover at the crater's edge. Table for Two: Order the flaky pastry-wrapped saganaki (traditional fried cheese) with fig jam at Assyrtico Wine Restaurant, a buzzy newcomer. Don't Miss: The richly preserved Bronze Age settlement of AkrotÃÂ­ri, sometimes referred to as the ""Minoan Pompeii,"" which reopened last spring. 4. Kauai, Hawaii . It's the oldest of Hawaii's eight main islands -- and arguably the most dramatic, with scenery that ranges from wind-eroded mountains and red-walled canyons to primeval rainforest and photo-ready waterfalls. Room to Book: No. 808 at the St. Regis Princeville Resort for unobstructed views of Hanalei Bay. Table for Two: Share a succession of small plates (slow-braised short ribs; honeycomb with goat cheese) at the laid-back, open-air Bar Acuda in Hanalei. Don't Miss: A six-hour hike with Chuck Blay of Kauai Nature Tours; you'll learn the myths of every fruit and flower along the way. 5. Boracay, Philippines . Once a backpacking haven with only the most basic accommodations, this 5-mile-long island now rivals better-known Asian destinations such as Phuket and Koh Samui, Thailand. A 45-minute flight from Manila brings you to either Kalibo or Caticlan, where boats connect directly to White Beach, whose powdery sand may just be the softest in the world. Room to Book: A short tuk-tuk ride from the southern end of White Beach, Mandala Spa & Villas feels like a true retreat, with daily yoga classes and massages included in room rates, along with all the mangoes you can eat. The cliffside Pool Villa has the best vantage point over the Sulu Sea. Table for Two: Feast on Mediterranean mezes at Kasbah (Station One, White Beach), where pillow-strewn sofas evoke North Africa on the sand. Don't Miss: Mandala Spa & Villas' Hilot Trilogy, which incorporates an ancient Filipino form of massage. 6. Maldives . This remote Indian Ocean archipelago greets travelers with white-sand beaches, atolls and secluded high-end resorts that lure honeymooners and celebrities. The world's lowest-lying nation has a close union with the sea: Where else would you find a hotel with a coral nursery and an underwater nightclub? That would be Niyama Maldives, a Per Aquum Resort. It has a restaurant reachable by boat only. 7. Maui . Peel back the tropical-paradise faÃÂ§ade of this Hawaiian island to reveal a rich variety of landscapes: the otherworldly summit of the volcanic crater Haleakala, the sugarcane fields and farms like O'o Farm, and the 1900s cowboy town of Makawao, with horses trotting down the back roads. For the ultimate tucked-away-ness, the eastern town of Hana at the edge of a rainforest is like falling back in time -- and after a day out exploring, you two can retreat to luxe Travaasa Hana Maui, a special place that emphasizes the culture and tradition of Hawaii, from the indigenous patterns used in textiles to ukulele and hula lessons. 8. Moorea,Tahiti . The less-visited sister island of Bora-Bora offers an intoxicating blend of rugged jungle interior, blue lagoons and scents of tiare, pamplemousse and vanilla that swirl in the air. It's believed that author James Michener's Bali Hai in Tales of the South Pacific was inspired by the island. To get the lay of the land, drive up Magic Mountain, and you'll see Opunohu and Cook's bays sparkle below. The Tahitians are typically friendly and open -- and can point you to the wild, coconut-strewn beach where Mutiny on the Bounty was filmed. 9. Vieques, Puerto Rico . The secret is definitely out about Vieques, which promises the key ingredients for romance, among them, a slew of pristine coves and beaches and a languid pace. Portions of the island are designated a National Wildlife refuge -- protecting sea turtles, lagoons and mangroves -- and the island's famous bioluminescent bay is filled with microscopic organisms that flash bright blue and illuminate the water. The eco mindset here carries through at the intimate Hix Island House, which opened its solar-powered six-room Casa Solaris in the past year, built by Canadian-born architect John Hix. 10. Bali . Bali's been at the apex of the romance circuit for decades, if not centuries, with couples drawn to the mist-shrouded temples, mountainous landscapes, Balinese art and world-famous friendliness of the locals. The island got a recent boost (as if it needed it) from the success of ""Eat, Pray, Love,"" whose film crew chose the white-sand Padang-Padang beach as backdrop. Just a short drive away from here is the new Le MÃÂ©ridien Bali Jimbaran, with a saltwater lagoon pool. See the rest of the world's most romantic islands.

"New York (CNN) -- Hundreds of people might have been exposed to hepatitis A while receiving communion on Christmas Day, Long Island officials said Monday. The Nassau County Department of Health is offering vaccines to those who attended two services at Our Lady of Lourdes Church in Massapequa Park in Long Island, New York, according to Nassau County Department of Health spokeswoman Mary Ellen Laurain. Individuals might be at risk if they received communion during the 10:30 am and noon Masses, according to a statement from the county health department. ""We know that there's a potential that (exposure) could have happened,"" she said. ""We think the risk is relatively low."" At least one member of the clergy involved in the communion process was infected with the disease, Laurain said. There have been no additional reports of illness. Some 1,300 people were in attendance between the two church services, she added. Symptoms of the disease include the onset of fever, fatigue, poor appetite, nausea, stomach pain, dark-colored urine and jaundice, according the statement. The disease is rarely fatal and most people recover within a few weeks without complications, it said. Individuals exposed to the disease should receive vaccination within two weeks of exposure, the statement said.","Hundreds of people might have been exposed to hepatitis A on Christmas Day .

"(CNN) -- Macau, the world's biggest casino hub, has overtaken Switzerland in the wealth stakes, being named the world's fourth richest territory by the World Bank. A new batch of data released by the World Bank showed the former Portuguese colony's GDP per person grew to $91,376 in 2013, compared to $77,196 in 2012. Only Luxembourg, Norway and Qatar are wealthier, according to the World Bank. Meanwhile, Swiss per capita GDP stayed nearly flat at $80,528 in 2013 compared to $78,929 the year before. That's the good business news from Macau. The bad news is that its casino industry's revenues have declined for the first time in nearly five years, as gamblers turn their attention to the World Cup. The former Portuguese colony made $3.4 billion from gambling in June, 3.7% less than in June last year and down 18% month-on-month. Macau is the world's top spot for the gambling industry, reporting a staggering $45 billion in gambling revenues last year -- nearly seven times the $6.5 billion that casinos in Las Vegas made during the same period. According to analysts, the sudden dip can be attributed to the month-long football World Cup prompting punters to swap casinos for online sports betting. The casino hub has been further hit by a large anti-corruption police investigation last month, which led to a crackdown on an international gambling ring that was operating an illegal $600 million World Cup betting operation out of a hotel in Macau.","Macau has overtaken Switzerland as the world's fourth richest territory by the World Bank .

"(CNN) -- The end is near and the credits are about to roll -- but we're not done with 2013 just yet. There's still time for you to get involved and tell us your top sporting moments over the past 12 months. While we've put our heads together and come out with our own top 10, we'd love to hear from you. So get in touch on Twitter by tweeting @Masters_JamesD with your thoughts on another stellar sporting year. Confession of the year -- Lance Armstrong . He was a hero and role model to millions across the globe but Lance Armstrong's world came crashing down in January after admitting to using testosterone and human growth hormone, as well as EPO -- a hormone naturally produced by human kidneys to stimulate red blood cell production. The confession, made to U.S. talk show host Oprah Winfrey in January, led to condemnation from millions and saw Armstrong stripped of his seven Tour de France titles. Shocking story of the year -- Oscar Pistorius . Heralded as an inspiration to athletes across the world just a year earlier, Oscar Pistorius' fall from grace was as rapid as it was shocking. A star of the London Olympic Games, Pistorius, nicknamed the ""Blade Runner"" for the special prostheses he uses for sprinting, was arrested by South African police after admitting to shooting girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp on Valentine's Day. He said it was an accident and will go on trial in March 2014 charged with murder. Winning moment of the year -- Andy Murray . A year after crying his eyes out on Wimbledon's Centre Court, Andy Murray finally ended Britain's 77-year wait for a men's singles champion in July. Murray defeated Novak Djokovic in a pulsating final to win his second grand slam and erase the pain of the defeat to Roger Federer 12 months earlier. After winning Olympic gold on the same tennis court at London 2012, Murray ensured his place in the nation's sporting history. Goodbye of the year -- Alex Ferguson . After 26 years, 13 domestic league titles, two European Champions League crowns, five FA Cups and four League Cups, Alex Ferguson brought down the curtain on his illustrious managerial career in May. Ferguson, who won 38 trophies during his tenure at Manchester United, led the club to the English Premier League title in his final season before stepping down. The Scot, the most successful British manager in the history of the game, bid farewell to Old Trafford following a period of unparalleled success. Team of the year -- Bayern Munich . It was the year that German football left the watching world in a trance as both Bayern Munich and Borussia Dortmund reached May's European Champions League final. Bayern, beaten in the 2012 final in its own stadium by Chelsea, triumphed 2-1 at Wembley and went on to win the treble after claiming the Bundesliga title and German domestic cup. The German team's form in the past few months has been nothing short of sensational, winning 14 of its 16 league games to sit top of the league going into the winter break as well as qualifying for the last 16 of the Champions League. Comeback of the year -- Oracle Team USA . Never before in the 162-year history of the America's Cup had any race captured the imagination quite like the contest between Oracle Team USA and Emirates Team New Zealand. Trailing 8-1, defending champion Oracle came back from the abyss to win 9-8 in the final race in San Francisco. It was the comebacks of all comebacks as the Americans, who were deducted two points before the opening race for placing lead pellets in their catamarans to gain extra weight, prevailed in dramatic fashion. Goodbye of the year -- Sachin Tendulkar . He was not just a cricket player -- he was a god. After 200 Test matches, 100 international centuries, Sachin Tendulkar waved goodbye to his adoring legion of fans in his home city of Mumbai in November. ""The Little Master,"" as he is affectionately known, is not just the highest run scorer in both the five-day and limited-overs formats of cricket, he is a global icon of the game. With a net worth of about $160 million from endorsements, property and cricket earnings, according to Singapore-based Wealth X, Tendulkar is cricket's richest player. Domination of the year -- Sebastian Vettel . Can anybody stop Sebastian Vettel? The 26-year-old German clinched a record-equaling fourth consecutive Formula One drivers' title in October, with three races to spare. By season's end he had won 13 races to equal the record of most victories in one campaign, set by compatriot Michael Schumacher in 2004. Vettel joined Schumacher, Juan Manuel Fangio and Alain Prost as a four-time champion and will be favorite to win a fifth in 2014. Heartwarming tale of the year -- Zahir Belounis . After a two-year struggle to leave Qatar following a pay dispute, French-Algerian footballer Zahir Belounis returned home to Paris. Belounis, who had endured a bitter struggle to secure an exit permit from the Gulf state, had previously threatened to go on hunger strike and spoken of suicide. The 33-year-old wrote an open letter to Bayern Munich manager Pep Guardiola and France legend Zinedine Zidane to help gain publicity for his cause. Not long after, he was granted his exit permit following a media campaign. History makers of the year -- European Solheim Cup team . For the very first time, Europe's women's golf team managed to do something which had always eluded them -- they won on American soil. Liselotte Neumann's Europeans, needing just three and a half points from the final day's play to retain the trophy they won in Ireland two years ago, won five and halved four of 12 singles matches to complete an 18-10 victory. It was 17-year-old Charley Hull who stole the show on the last day in Colorado in August -- recording an astonishing 5 & 4 win over 2010 U.S. Open champion and world No. 11 Paula Creamer. So what did we miss? Should we have included the Boston Red Sox winning the World Series? The Chicago Blackhawks triumphing in the Stanley Cup? Bosnia and Herzegovina qualifying for the World Cup? Or the British and Irish Lions securing a first Test series win in 16 years against Australia? Let us know your thoughts and what you're looking forward to in 2014. Join the debate with James Masters on Twitter.","Lance Armstrong's confession tops the year's sporting moments .

"London, England (CNN) -- An international team of climate scientists is calling on the public to help with a new initiative aimed at predicting how the climate will change during the 21st century. Using the collective power of ordinary home computers, scientists from the United Kingdom, United States and South Africa will run thousands of regional climate modeling tests which would otherwise take much longer to complete, even on the most up-to-date supercomputers. The regional modeling project builds on the global modeling work started in 2003 by UK climate scientist Myles Allen and his team at the Atmospheric, Oceanic and Planetary Physics department at the UK's Oxford University. Project coordinator Suzanne Rosier told CNN: ""Up to now, participants have run global models for us. What's new today is that the global model you download has a regional model embedded inside it which models in much more detail, and is capable of capturing weather features that the global model is too coarse to capture."" With the help of the public's PCs scientists will now start running regional climate models for the western United States, Europe and southern Africa. People interested in signing up to the project can visit http://climateprediction.net/weatherathome/ where they can download all the necessary tools to start running regional climate models from their own computers. ""There's a very neat graphics package that gives you rotational globe and a world view. The new experiment gives you the regional view so you can see various things -- temperature, clouds, pressure -- evolving as your model runs,"" Rosier said. Each regional model takes between five and seven days to complete. There is no limit on users and the program is designed to run when your computer is idle. Rosier says running the climate model will not affect the running speed of your computer. ""The more people who sign up, the more science we can do,"" she said. To date, the global modeling project has attracted over 300,000 participants -- of which 50,000 are dedicated users -- from 138 countries and has run over 90 million model years of climate data. For the regional modeling, Oxford University is being assisted by Oregon State University and South Africa's University of Cape Town. Oregon State will be examining data from models of extreme precipitations in the western United States. Philip Mote, director of the Oregon Climate Change Research Institute at the university, told CNN: ""There are early indications from modeling that we might see a big increase in extreme precipitation events. Based on that very immature science people are already making decisions about culvert size and bridge clearances and things like that. ""These have real costs associated with them and we hope that in the next couple of years we'll be able to provide much better scientific values for those decisions.""","Scientists in UK and U.S. call for public help to run climate prediction simulations .

"(CNN) -- Australia is emerging from the grip of its strongest La Nina weather pattern on record -- a meteorological event that brings either devastating floods or, in the case of its counterpart El Nino, scorching droughts. According to the Australian Bureau of Meteorology, the weather pattern that brought dramatic floods to southern Queensland a year ago -- one of the most intense on record -- is waning, but oceans around the eastern seaboard are still warm enough to cause high pressure systems that dump months of rainfall in a matter of a few days. ""There was a very slow moving trough over inland Australia that stretched from the far northwest, through the Northern Territory and on to the southeast including New South Wales and Victoria,"" said Jenny Sturrock, acting senior meteorologist at the National Metereological Centre. ""When it meets all that nice warm moisture from the Coral and Tasman Seas, we got several days of heavy rainfall that led to flooding,"" she said. ""This type of broad scale pattern is more conducive to rainfall but it's also exacerbated by short-term meteorological patterns too."" Scientists are blaming La Nina for the recent flooding in Australia and the Philippines. The weather pattern is part of a natural cycle called the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and occurs when cold water builds up on the west coast of the South American continent. Pulled by strong easterly winds, the cold water surges west across the Pacific, creating a ""cold tongue"" that pushes warm water and a consequent high pressure system ahead of it. The resulting weather system -- filled with warm, water-laden air -- dumps unusually heavy rain when it makes landfall. Its opposite effect, El Nino, is usually marked by wetter weather over South America. Currently, Argentina is in the grip of drought. La Nina occurs at intervals between a few years and a decade and generally lasts for a year or two. To what extent global warming has contributed to the intensity of the weather pattern is still not known, with records of the event only stretching back 60 years. Nevertheless, the bureau has said the pattern is similar in intensity to La Nina flooding in 1939 and 1950. Long-term weather patterns across the Australia are notoriously difficult to forecast and meteorologists are collecting oral evidence from Aboriginal people to get a handle on the continent's weather cycles. The Bureau of Meteorology's Indigenous Weather Knowledge project aims to build a weather map of Australia based on knowledge of weather patterns from indigenous communities. Under this system, a startlingly complex mosaic of weather patterns is being mapped. For example, studies have established that the Aboriginal people of the Sydney region recognized six distinct seasons, rather than the four given to the area by its white settlers.","Australia emerging from strongest La Nina on record .

"Durban, South Africa (CNN) -- An agreement reached Sunday in South Africa will help tackle the challenges of climate change for years to come, the United Nations' chief said. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon hailed the decision reached by parties of the Climate Change Convention in Durban, South Africa, which agreed to extend efforts set forth in the Kyoto Protocol. The Kyoto Protocol, ratified by 37 industrialized countries, was set to expire in 2012. It mandates that industrialized nations cut their greenhouse gas emissions. Ban ""welcomes the agreement to establish a second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol that will increase certainty for the carbon market and provides additional incentives for new investments in technology and the infrastructure necessary to fight climate change,"" according to a statement from his office. As part of a broad pact, nations will agree in some sort of a legal format to curb their carbon emissions. The talks also launched the Green Climate Fund, which would essentially channel about $100 billion by 2020 to vulnerable countries to help them deal with the effects of climate change. U.S. chief negotiator Todd Stern described the talks as ""tough"" but worthwhile. ""For the first time there is an agreement to negotiate a legal accord of some sort, a legal instrument that is applicable to all countries -- that is a new thing. That means China, India and Brazil -- and there is no hedging in it,"" Stern said. He added, ""We have been pushing for the last three years continually to change the paradigm of this negotiation so it did apply to all the big emitters because you can't solve this problem if you have 50-60% of world emissions not at the table. So an agreement to do this legal accord --that's applicable to of all the major parties, that's a big deal."" The British secretary for energy and climate change also said he was pleased. ""I think we have all come away from this now with a really credible package which will address the problems of global warming,"" Chris Huhne said. The agreement came after a marathon session of negotiations. ""It was an extraordinarily complex negotiation with a lot of moving parts,"" said Elliot Diringer, an executive vice president of the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions who was an adviser to former U.S. President Bill Clinton. ""Up until the last minute, there was every reason to think that it could well have fallen apart. So I think that the fact that it came together is in of itself a success, even if the outcome doesn't fully satisfy anyone,"" Diringer said. Critics who were not satisfied with the outcome include the international charity Oxfam, which said negotiators at the U.N. climate talks agreed to the ""bare minimum deal possible."" ""The plan gets the Green Climate Fund up and running without any sources of funding ... and gets a second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol without key members,"" Oxfam said in a statement Sunday. Without further action, Oxfam said, ""farmers in parts of Africa could face a drop in crop yields of more than 50% within this generation or that of their children. Food prices could more than double within the next two decades, up to half of which caused by climate change.""","NEW: Delegates agree to a Green Climate Fund, which would help countries deal with effects of climate change .

"Barcelona FC will travel to London on Tuesday evening ahead of Saturday's Champions League final because of fears Iceland's volcanic ash cloud could disrupt their travel plans later in the week.

Players and coaching staff had initially planned to travel on Thursday, 48 hours ahead of their clash against Manchester United at Wembley Stadium, but plumes of ash are already beginning to disrupt flights in Scotland and the north of England. Last year, Barcelona were forced to travel 1,000 kilometers by coach to play the first leg of their semi-final tie with Inter Milan -- a game they lost 3-1 -- when an ash cloud from Iceland's Eyjafjallajokull volcano caused widespread flight disruption across Europe in April 2010.","Volcanic ash cloud forces Spanish champions onto early flight to London .

"(CNN)  -- The militant fighters of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) have been engaged in a campaign of violence against the Turkish state for more than two decades with the goal of establishing an autonomous Kurdish homeland. PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan, pictured in 1992. Ocalan is currently serving a life sentence in a Turkish prison. The PKK accuses Turkey of oppressing Kurdish culture and suppressing Kurdish nationhood. More than half of the world's Kurds (10 to 12 million) are estimated to live in Turkey, making up a majority in the country's south-eastern region. Iraq, Iran and Syria also have sizeable Kurdish minorities. But the group is considered a terrorist organization by the U.S. and the European Union and is estimated to have been responsible for the deaths of more than 30,000 Turkish security force members and civilians, according to the U.S. State Department. In 1984 the PKK launched a guerrilla struggle in response to the wave of repression that followed Turkey's military coup in 1980 when the Kurdish language and Kurdish place names banned. By then the group's founder, Abdullah Ocalan, was living in exile in Syria where he organized PKK training camps. Since the 1980s the group has claimed responsibility for regular ambushes on military targets in the southeast but also bomb attacks across the country, notably in Turkish holiday resorts. During the 1990s the Turkish military launched a concerted campaign to eliminate the PKK threat, adopting commando tactics and targeting the group's mountain bases. The establishment of a ""no-fly zone"" over northern Iraq following the first Gulf War in 1991 also allowed Turkish troops to conduct frequent raids on PKK strongholds across the border. In 1998, under intensive Turkish pressure, Syria expelled Ocalan and shut down the PKK camps he had established there. Ocalan was snatched by Turkish commandos a few months later while seeking asylum in Kenya. Despite calling for a PKK cease-fire and peaceful negotiation following his capture, Ocalan was sentenced to death in 1999 following a trial condemned by the European Court of Human Rights. However his sentence was reduced to life imprisonment when Turkey abolished the death penalty in 2002. In the same year Ocalan's brother, Osman Ocalan, who had inherited leadership of the PKK, vowed to form a new group to campaign peacefully for Kurdish rights. But the frequency of PKK terror attacks has steadily risen since 2004 and Turkey claims the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq and the country's subsequent instability following the overthrow of the Saddam Hussein regime in 2003 has enabled the PKK to regroup. It accuses the PKK of launching attacks on Turkish targets from secret bases in the mountainous and semi-autonomous Kurdish region of northern Iraq. Earlier this year Turkey sent large contingents of soldiers, tanks, guns and armored personnel carriers to reinforce its frontier. But following the deaths of 27 soldiers and 12 civilians in recent attacks, Turkish military leaders have urged the government to give them the green light to strike at PKK bases inside Iraq.

"London (CNN) -- A second batch of e-mails thought to originate from the UK research unit involved in the ""Climategate"" controversy in 2009 has been posted on the Internet. A file containing approximately 5,000 private e-mails from the University of East Anglia's Climate Research Unit (CRU) was published online Tuesday, according to the university. The CRU said in a statement that there has been ""no evidence of a recent breach of our systems,"" and they suspect the latest leak may have come from the original theft two years ago. ""If genuine...these e-mails have the appearance of having been held back after the theft of data and e-mails in 2009 to be released at a time designed to cause maximum disruption to the imminent international climate talks,"" the CRU statement said. ""As in 2009, extracts from emails have been taken completely out of context."" The original theft and subsequent publication of around 1,000 CRU e-mails in November 2009 led to claims that climate scientists were manipulating or falsifying data to exaggerate the threat of global warming. 'Climategate' explained . But a seven-month UK review chaired by Muir Russell cleared the CRU and its director professor Phil Jones in July 2010. ""We went through this very carefully and we concluded that these behaviors did not damage our judgment of the integrity, the honesty, the rigor with which they had operated as scientists,"" Russell said when the report was published. A U.S. Environmental Protection Agency report published last year also cleared climate scientists saying that their critics ""routinely misunderstand or mis-characterize the scientific issues...and draw faulty conclusions on the state of the science."" More recently, a report published by the Berkeley Earth Surface Temperature project concluded that climate change is real. The leak comes just days before the latest round of United Nations climate talks which get underway in Durban, South Africa on November 28.","New email leak released six days before United Nations climate talks in Durban .

"Sochi, Russia (CNN) -- After several tumultuous days that included police detentions, interrogations and a public flogging from angry Cossacks, the dissident punk band Pussy Riot struck back. The controversial Russian musicians released an angry music video on Thursday slamming Russian President Vladimir Putin's crackdown on free speech and political expression. They also took aim at the Sochi Olympics' whopping $50 billion price tag. Titled ""Putin Will Teach You To Love Your Country,"" the music video included footage filmed Wednesday of Cossacks -- modern-day descendants of 19th-century horsemen who pushed the boundaries of the Russian empire -- flogging the women moments after they began lip-synching their song next to a large ""Sochi 2014"" sign in the Olympic city. ""The goal is to show what it's like to be a political activist in Olympic Sochi,"" Pussy Riot member Maria Tolokonnikova told CNN. Video shows Pussy Riot members beaten by Cossacks . The band invited foreign media to a news conference at a hotel in Sochi for the unveiling of the new video on Thursday. But upon arrival, a bizarre scene unfolded. An employee at the hotel informed journalists a conference room would not be available. Outside, uniformed police and security officers in civilian clothes awaited the arrival of the band, alongside several dozen journalists. Also waiting, at least five male university students accompanied by a man dressed in a giant chicken suit. When four women from the band walked up, arms locked, the university students pulled out raw chickens and began chanting ""We like sex with chicken"" in mangled English. The students and costumed chicken then attempted to disrupt the makeshift news conference given by the women in the park outside the hotel. ""We don't understand their behavior and that's why we're protesting,"" said 23-year old Sergei Barashov, one of the members of the anti-Pussy Riot demonstrators. Barashov said he was afraid the punk band would desecrate a Russian Orthodox cathedral that had been recently constructed on the outskirts of Sochi's Olympic Park. Pussy Riot rocketed to international fame after the provocative musicians stormed into a Moscow cathedral in 2012 and performed an expletive-ridden song denouncing Putin. Tolokonnikova and her band mate Maria Alekhina were sent to prison on charges of hooliganism and inciting religious hatred. Russian authorities released the pair shortly before the start of the Olympics in Sochi along with several other high-profile critics of the Russian government. Prison failed to silence the two young women. They immediately went back to denouncing the Kremlin, as well as conditions inmates endure in Russian prisons. In the new song, Pussy Riot sings about the ""constitution being lynched,"" government pressure against Russia's lone independent TV station and of last week's sentencing of environmentalist Evgeny Vitishko to a penal colony for three years. Vitishko, an outspoken critic who drew attention to environmental damage caused by the massive construction around the Sochi Olympics, has gone on hunger strike, according to his defense attorney. On Tuesday, police in Sochi detained members of Pussy Riot, along with at least seven human rights activists and journalists in connection with the investigation into an alleged theft at the band's hotel. Hours later, all charges were dropped and the detainees were released from the police station, located just a few minutes' drive from the Olympic Torch. The detention, as well as the televised attack by the Cossacks, have put the International Olympic Committee on the defensive. ""Personally I found the video and pictures very unsettling,"" said Mark Adams, a spokesman for the IOC. ""It happened in Sochi, but it was unrelated to an Olympic venue and was not, as far as I know, a demonstration against the Olympics,"" Adams said on Thursday. In its new song, Pussy Riot also takes aim at a quirk of bathroom interior designing in Sochi that became a social media joke in the Olympic Village and around the world. ""They took gay pride to the washroom,"" the band sings. ""And made a two-seat toilet a priority.""","At a bizarre news conference in Sochi, Pussy Riot unveils a video critical of Vladimir Putin .

"OXFORD, Mississippi (CNN)  -- Here, in what could be called the Fort Knox of dope, Mahmoud ElSohly waits patiently as an assistant unlocks the stainless steel door to a climate-controlled vault. Mahmoud ElSohly oversees the nation's largest legal marijuana garden at the University of Mississippi. Once inside, under the gaze of security cameras and a blinking motion sensor, another scientist pries open the lid of a large cardboard barrel, opens a large plastic bag and digs his hand into the vat of meticulously manicured marijuana. We are in the Coy W. Waller Laboratory Complex on the campus of the University of Mississippi, getting a look at the only legal marijuana farm and production facility in the United States. This is the government's ""cannabis drug repository."" This is the government's stash. Since 1968, the National Institute on Drug Abuse has contracted with the university lab to grow, harvest and process marijuana and to ship it to licensed facilities across the country for research purposes. The lab also collects samples of marijuana seized by police to determine its potency and to document national drug trends. Like a cask in a wine cellar, this barrel of marijuana is marked with the year of vintage. It is one of many in the room. ElSohly, the director of the lab, guesses that it holds 10 to 15 kilos, or about 22 to 33 pounds, of impeccably clean ""product.""  Watch what the government's growing Â» . How much would this be worth on the street? ""A lot,"" he answers. He's not being evasive. It's just that the value of the marijuana, like the gold at Fort Knox, fluctuates wildly. And like the government gold, it is not for sale. So the question is academic and of little concern. But the security of the operation is of obvious concern. Earlier, amid blazingly green plants in the facility's grow room, ElSohly gave us a Cliffs Notes rundown of the facility's security. ""Within this building right here,"" he said, ""we have seven different alarm systems. We have camera systems. We have cameras in this room."" Cameras, an aide tells us, that are monitored by the Drug Enforcement Agency in suburban Washington. The nearby fields, where the marijuana is grown, are double fenced, ElSohly said. The fields are empty now, awaiting the National Institute on Drug Abuse's next order. But when a crop is in growing, armed guards are posted around the clock in the low guard towers. And everywhere, there are locked doors. Keyed locks and push-button locks. Locks are as omnipresent as the skunk-like smell of raw marijuana. In the past few years, we have seen marijuana from an array of perspectives on the government's side of the war on drugs. On the northern border, we've flown with Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials in the Cascade Mountains, retracing the path of smugglers who flew helicopters dangerously weighed down with bundles of ""B.C. Bud"" through mountain gaps to avoid detection. On the southern border, we've been escorted into an old jail cell to see 3 tons of marijuana seized the previous night and talked to border agents about the seizure. They were nonchalant. And last year, far from either border, we accompanied drug czar John Walters on a trip to a national forest where a drug cartel had a 10,000-plant garden. So the sight of mega-quantities of marijuana is not new to us. But this is the first time we've seen a taxpayer-funded marijuana garden. And the incongruous feature isn't necessary the sight of government-sanction plants but rather the lengths taken to protect it from the world beyond the double fence, where, of course, marijuana is abundant. Inside the lab, scientists tend to about 500 plants. Outside the fence, police found 6,000 plants in 10 Napa County, California, homes in 2007. Inside the fence, the government processed 400 kilograms -- about 880 pounds -- of marijuana during its last harvest in 2007. Outside the fence, police eradicated more than 5.2 million plants on public and private lands in California alone last year. Of course, marijuana inside the fence has added value as a scientific tool. Researchers know the genetic makeup of the plants, and that is essential if you're studying the impact of a drug that, with 14.8 million users, is the most widely used illicit drug in the country. And that's what brought us to the lab in the first place. The government was announcing that the average potency of marijuana outside the fence has reached a landmark record level. Although street marijuana in the early 1980s had an average strength of 4 percent tetrahydrocannabinol -- the drug's primary psychoactive ingredient -- the average was 10.1 percent last year, the government announced. Mexican drug cartels now control about 90 percent of the marijuana smuggled into the United States, according to the Drug Enforcement Administration. The marijuana is of lower quality and is mostly sold in urban areas, a spokesman said. The marijuana coming across the southwest border, traditionally a source of low-potency drugs, has increased in strength from a median potency of 4.8 percent in 2003 to 7.3 percent in 2007. As a consequence, inexperienced or young marijuana users may be more prone to overdose, federal officials say. And users hoping to achieve a state of euphoria may experience dysphoria, a state of anxiety and irritability, and perhaps other ill effects. Legalization advocates argue that the government could require THC content labels on marijuana, much like alcohol is labeled, so users could regulate their intake. The government knows about the average THC levels of street drugs because of work done at the University of Mississippi lab. That work begins with Susan Foster, a lab employee. It is Foster's job to receive shipments of marijuana from crime labs across the country. Foster assigns each bag -- typically containing 25 grams -- a computer tracking number. It is spring, so the workload is increasing, Foster says. In April, the lab received between 300 and 400 samples. But 500 samples is not uncommon during summer months, she says. Other lab workers ""manicure"" the drug, removing seeds and stems, and put the clean drug in small beakers. A solution is added, and the liquid is gasified and analyzed by four machines. Ultimately, a computer screen displays the chemical composition of the samples. ""The highest [THC level] that I've ever seen was in excess of 30 percent,"" ElSohly said, adding that such high potency is rare. But potent dope is becoming more plentiful. ""I predict that the potency will continue to go up simply because there are still a lot of samples that are 3 percent and 4 percent and 5 percent,"" ElSohly says. ""What I expect in the future is that more and more will be 9 percent and higher, so the potency on the average will continue to get higher. ""But there's obviously a physical limit to how much THC the plant can produce,"" he said. So ElSohly predicts that potency will plateau at 15 to 16 percent, probably in the next five to 10 years. ElSohly said he personally opposes the legalization of marijuana for recreational use, believing that it would increase abuse of the drug. But he says that it has medical benefits for cancer patients and others but that smoking the drug is a poor means of medicating a person. His first effort to develop a pharmaceutically acceptable means of delivering the drug flopped, he says. His delivery device: a suppository. ""People really don't like suppositories, so it really didn't make it on the market,"" he said. He is now developing a delivery method that works like a skin patch but tucked into the mouth. In January, a DEA administrator turned down an application by a Massachusetts man to open a second facility to grow marijuana for research purposes. The DEA said professor Lyle Craker failed to show that the ""longstanding existing system in the United States of producing and distributing research-grade marijuana ... is inadequate."" It also objected to Craker's sponsor, saying the sponsor's ""past and ongoing"" use of marijuana ""is unacceptable for anyone seeking to have a prominent role in overseeing"" a marijuana farm. Craker is appealing the decision. So for now, the Mississippi farm remains the only legal marijuana farm in the U.S. And ElSohly has no plans to endanger that arrangement. ""I want to ask what your Christmas parties are like,"" he is told. He deadpans: ""No smoking.""","University of Mississippi lab is home to the nation's only legal pot farm .

"(CNN) -- Facebook has been quiet for the past six months, but only because it's been working on new products. No, one of them is not a Facebook Phone. ""The phone just doesn't make any sense,"" said a smiling but adamant Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg when asked whether he was working on the mythical Facebook smartphone. The rumor that the social network is working on a physical phone has been bouncing around for years. As recently as July, Bloomberg reported Facebook was working with HTC on a smartphone for 2013, citing sources with knowledge of the matter. Zuckerberg insisted that the number of users the company could reach with a hardware offering ""doesn't move the needle for us."" Zuckerberg made the comments during a rare press appearance on Tuesday at the TechCruch Disrupt conference in San Francisco. He was interviewed on stage by Silicon Valley blogger and investor Michael Arrington in front of a fully packed auditorium. The Facebook founder and chief executive has stayed out of the spotlight for the past four months since his company went public. In that time, Facebook's stock has plummeted from its opening day price of $38 a share to around half that. It closed at $19.43 on Tuesday. Analyze your Facebook data with new Wolfram Alpha tool . ""The performance of the stock has obviously been disappointing,"" said Zuckerberg. Throughout the 30-minute talk, Zuckerberg, wearing a brown T-shirt with the three small Facebook icons for notifications on it, remained calm and upbeat, rambling energetically a bit a times. He was optimistic because his company was focused on building value over a long period of time, he said. Many factors have been blamed for the stock's dismal performance, including Facebook choosing the wrong market, waiting too long to go public, overpricing shares and issuing too many shares. Analysts and investors have been waiting to hear from the young chief executive himself, looking for new products or at least more information on what, exactly, the company's plan is for the next year. This event gave Zuckerberg an opportunity to brush off the company's recent troubles and drop vague hints about future products. ""Over the coming weeks and months I think we can expect to see the cool stuff that people have been working on,"" he said. The recent dearth of new releases and silence from the company was apparently due to some internal restructuring in which the company moved people around to focus on product groups. One of first results of all that reshuffling was the rebuilt iPhone app, which is faster version of the last app, but lacking any major new features. ""It was not where we wanted it to be before,"" he said of the app. ""And to be honest, even what we have now is not as good as it can be."" Other teams have been working ""in parallel"" on new features for the native app, he said. While Zuckerberg didn't specify what those unreleased features were, he did touch on a few areas he's excited about, including search, a field dominated by Google and Bing. ""We do on the order of a billion queries a day already, and we're basically not even trying,"" said Zuckerberg. He claims people do search though Facebook, and not just for other people but for brands and other information. He sees a future where people can ask questions that only Facebook has the data to answer, such as what restaurants in a specific city are recommended by your friends. ""That's one kind of obvious thing that would be interesting for us to do in the future,"" he said. Facebook will continue to let Instagram be Instagram, helping it gain users without trying to integrate the photo app into the larger Facebook infrastructure. Facebook recently purchased the company for $1 billion. But the topic Zuckerberg hammered on the most was mobile. One of the biggest concerns investors have had is Facebook's ability to make money off of mobile users. The company makes money on the desktop version of its site by serving simple square ads on the right hand side of the site. When the company went public in May, there were no ads on the mobile version of its site or on the iPhone, iPad and Android apps. But Zuckerberg insisted the company is doing very well on mobile now. There are mobile ads, more mobile users and early signs point to those phone owners spending more time on the app and engaging more with ads than people who visit the desktop version of the site. In what seemed another attempt to sooth investors, he backpedaled a bit on the now famous statement from his letter to investors: ""We don't build services to make money; we make money to build better services."" ""From the beginning, we've had this healthy understanding that we need to do both,"" said Zuckerberg. Asked if he still codes, Zuckerberg said only for fun because if he wrote code for Facebook he would be in charge of fixing it. Does Mark Zuckerberg's code break, asked Arrington? ""Everything I do breaks, but we fix it quickly,"" replied Zuckerberg. Zuckerberg: Facebook's stock dive is 'disappointing,'","Mark Zuckerberg makes first public comments since Facebook went public .

"(CNN) -- My marriage ended in 1995 after 23 years. My two daughters were adults. I knew I would be required to pay alimony, split the assets and provide health insurance for a reasonable period of time. But a marriage that had been difficult for many years was finally over, or so I thought. I didn't know I was about to enter the twilight zone of alimony-without-end in Massachusetts. The trial took three days, and a judgment took 10 months. My legal bills were nearly $150,000. I was ordered to pay $865 a week -- forever. After 9/11, my business suffered, as many did, and I could not afford the payments. I racked up credit card debt that terrified me. I had to file for bankruptcy. When I went to court to modify the alimony payment, the judge recused herself from the case, saying her husband had once played cards with the bankruptcy trustee, and I would have to start over. Something was very wrong, and I had to fix it. I launched a website, MassAlimonyReform.org, and with my current wife, Jeanie, and several couples in similar situations, began what became the alimony reform movement. At that time, I didn't know it was common for ex-wives to go back to court when a former spouse got married and get an increase in alimony if the new wife added income to the marriage. I also discovered that the lower-earning spouse needed to be supported to the standard of the lifestyle of the marriage -- and that judges could not put an end date to alimony, even for short-term marriages. All alimony was for life. Payers did not have the right to retire. Jeanie, who was divorced in New York after a 23-year marriage, was told she would get only three years of maintenance. While married to me in Massachusetts, she was forced to contribute income to supplement my payments to my ex-wife, or I would go to jail. She took on a second job. Despite scant media attention, our organization began to grow. Horror stories like mine were coming in daily, and people from all over the country began to join MAR. A major turning point came when The Boston Globe ran an article that described Massachusetts' alimony law. That day, many women about to marry men who paid alimony called to say they were canceling their weddings. The Second Wives Club, headed by Deb Scanlan, was born. Massachusetts Rep. Steven Walsh advised me that legislators only acted during ""trouble in their village."" We spent many months teaching those villagers who were suffering under the law how to persuade legislators to support the cause. In 2009, after several attempts to pass reform, the Massachusetts judiciary chairmen created the Alimony Reform Task Force. Members included the Mass Bar, Boston Bar, Women's Bar, American Association of Matrimonial Lawyerse, the chief justice of probate and me, the only nonlawyer. I provided descriptions of the problems and the lawyers provided the solutions. The chairs of the task force, Sen. Gail Candaras and Rep. John Fernandes, approved the bill, and it was passed unanimously in the House and Senate. It was signed by Gov. Deval Patrick on September 26, 2011, and went into effect on March 1. Click here for the opposite view: Why the new law is bad for women . The new law provides guidelines and structure, consistency and predictability. It provides reasonable terms of alimony to help lower-earning former spouses adjust and return to the job market or live on their alimony, marital assets, Social Security and pensions from the marriage. It suspends, reduces or terminates alimony if a recipient spouse is co-habitating. Payers' alimony obligation ends when they reach full retirement age, as defined by the Social Security Act. This allows a payer and payee to plan for retirement because they know ahead of time that it will end. There are guidelines for how long alimony must be paid based on the length of the marriage. Since the law was signed, I have had calls about payers' ex-spouses getting married. Long-time alimony payers are finally free. Receiving spouses are going back to work. What was once an entitlement is now based on need and ability to pay. Judges have guidance they have been asking for and are happy to have. Attorneys can solve cases that went on forever, and Massachusetts residents are no longer afraid to get married for fear of unending litigation in case the marriage fails. No matter where you live in Massachusetts, the result will be the same. The mission I began is now spreading to many states all over the country. I have been consulting with divorce reform activists in Florida, Colorado, Oregon, Connecticut, New Jersey, Virginia and South Carolina. People need to be self-supporting after a term of alimony and not rely an ex-spouse. Alimony is support payment from a spouse, who has the ability to pay, to a spouse in need, for a reasonable length of time. That needs to be the rule, not the exception. In Massachusetts, it is the law. Now it is the duty of legislators in other states to listen to victims of ruinous alimony laws and do the same. Join us on Facebook/CNNOpinion.

"(CNN) -- It was intended as a piece of comedy, but it's turned into a drama. A young American living in the United Arab Emirates has been imprisoned since April, his family says, for posting what was intended to be a funny video on the Internet. Now, the family of Shezanne ""Shez"" Cassim wants to bring attention to his case ahead of a hearing December 16. The video in question is a 19-minute short that pokes fun at a clique of Dubai teens who are influenced by hip-hop culture. In the 1990s, the label ""Satwa G"" was coined for a group of suburban teens who were known to talk tougher than they really were. The video depicts a look at a ""combat school"" in the suburb of Satwa, where these ""gangsters"" are trained. The training includes how to throw sandals at targets, using clothing accessories as whips, and how to call on the phone for backup. ""It's like someone in the U.S. making a parody video of a Brooklyn hipster and getting thrown in jail for it and being held in jail for months without bail,"" Cassim's brother, Shervon Cassim, told CNN affiliate KARE. ""That's what's going on here."" Cassim's family says Shez, 29, has been charged with endangering national security, but they've not been told what about the video endangered security. UAE authorities did not respond to CNN requests for details about what charges Cassim may be facing and why. ""It's just a straightforward silly comedy video. And he's being treated like some sort of dangerous criminal, high security criminal that they need to keep under maximum security conditions,"" Shervon Cassim told KARE about his brother. Shez Cassim has lost a lot of weight, but is otherwise in good physical condition, his brother told CNN. Cassim, from Woodbury, Minnesota, moved to Dubai in 2006 after graduating college to work for PricewaterhouseCoopers. Dubai lands Middle East's first World Expo . He and some friends made and posted the video online in 2012. He was arrested in April 2013. According to the family, Cassim and eight friends have been charged under a cybercrimes law for endangering public order. This law, the family says, wasn't passed until after the video had been released. Two attempts by Cassim's lawyers to get him released on bail have been rejected. The U.S. State Department is providing consular services to Cassim, a department official said, and has attended all his court hearings. ""The U.S. Embassy and Consulate General have engaged with UAE counterparts to urge a fair and expedient trial and judgment,"" the official said. The Satwa G's, the family said in a statement, were known as wanna-be gangsters, and that's how Cassim portrayed them. ""These 'gangstas' were known for their decidedly mild behavior and were seen as the total opposite of actual criminals,"" the statement said. ""The fictional training depicted in the video teaches techniques that include the best way to throw a sandal at a newspaper (target) and, ultimately, how to use the mobile phone when in trouble."" At the last hearing, the judge in the case asked for an Arabic translation of the video, giving the family some hope that the authorities will realize that it was a parody. ""I just want my son home for Christmas,"" said Cassim's mother, Jean Cassim, in a statement. ""He's a good young man with a great career and has never been in trouble. Now he's being held for no reason. I've been praying, going to mass and lighting candles, and that's what I'm going to keep doing."" An average of about 2,500 Americans are jailed abroad every year, and about a third of those arrests are related to illegal drugs, the U.S. State Department says.

But they can perform many vital services such as providing a list of attorneys, assisting in contacting your family, helping your family to send money, and monitoring your health and welfare,"" the State Department says.","An American citizen is imprisoned in UAE .

"(CNN) -- Even though Hurricane Irene has been downgraded to a tropical storm, its powerful winds and drenching rain continue to pose danger to people who venture into it, the head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency said Sunday. People should ""stay inside, stay safe,"" FEMA Administrator Craig Fugate told CNN's ""State of the Union"" program. ""For a lot of folks, the danger still exists. We still will have trees coming down, heavy rain, strong winds."" Hundreds of thousands of people have lost electrical power, and it will take time to get it all restored, Fugate warned. ""I think some people will get power back rather quickly, but other people, it's going to be days,"" he said on the NBC program ""Meet the Press."" In addition, Fugate said anyone evacuated in the storm that made landfall twice -- first in North Carolina on Saturday and again in New Jersey on Sunday -- should avoid returning to their homes until floodwaters have receded and emergency crews have cleared fallen trees and downed power lines. ""Don't go back yet. Let local officials give you the all clear,"" Fugate said.","Fugate says the storm remains dangerous even when downgraded .

"(CNN) -- There are few people who can say their job saved them, but former gang member Rafael Jimenez says he's one of them. ""If I wasn't working here I'd be on the streets looking for problems or, even worse, selling drugs,"" Jimenez told CNN en EspaÃ±ol. ""Working here saved my life,"" said Jimenez, dressed in his blue uniform and cooking cap. The 44-year-old works as a baker at Homeboy Bakery, part of Homeboy Industries in East Los Angeles, the largest gang rehabilitation program in the country. The program was founded in 1992 by Father Greg Boyle, who has counseled and mentored thousands of gang members. This month marks Jimenez's one-year anniversary of getting off of drugs and out of the 4th Street Flats gang in East L.A. The youngest of six siblings, he says he joined the gang at age 11 and spent the next 30 years selling drugs, in and out of jail and gang banging. It wasn't until he started thinking about what his son's future would look like that he decided to leave the gang life. ""I knew if I kept going at it, I would be dead or in jail. I can't believe I wasted all that time,"" Jimenez said. ""And, now I'm baking pastries with rivals that I would've never spoken to just last year."" Homeboy Industries' program has been so successful that other gang rehabilitation programs around the country are now looking to them as a model. Boyle hopes to soon launch National Homeboy Network, a yearly conference that would connect programs around the world to share best practices and explore what works for different communities. ""About 46 programs, in different degrees of progress, have come to us for technical assistance, or we have gone to them to help them set up,"" Boyle told CNN. ""And that's when I thought, what if we were to start a network to help even more people?"" Known as the ""gang capital"" of the nation, Los Angeles has more than 450 active gangs with a combined membership of 45,000 people, according to the LAPD. Few organizations have lasted as long as Homeboy Industries, said Nane Alejandrez, director of Santa Cruz Barrios Unidos, a nonprofit organization helping former prisoners and gang members integrate back into society. Over the years, Alejandrez has partnered and worked closely with Homeboy Industries and Boyle. Alejandrez returned from the Vietnam War to find his neighborhood facing its own street war. He founded Barrios Unidos in 1977 to help struggling youth reclaim and restore their lives by providing them with life-enhancing alternatives. ""When you meet someone like Father Greg, a man of the church, you're able to sit one on one with him and share that pain with him, it makes you see that we all make mistakes and we can change,"" Alejandrez sabid. According to the study from the University of California Los Angeles, six out of 10 gang members who go to Homeboy Industries are able to integrate back into society successfully and stay away from violence and gang-related activity. ""Homeboys Industries has been so helpful and supportive,"" said Jimenez. ""If you want to change, this is the place to start."" Ex-gang member Mario Lundes, weary of being in and out of jail, decided to make a positive change and seek out a regular job. But extensive tattoo removal from his forehead, cheeks and neck -- a service Homeboy Industries offers -- would be a vital part of the process. ""I have so many tattoos on my face and hands, I can see why people don't want to give me a chance,"" Lundes said in an interview with CNN en EspaÃ±ol. ""Looking like this, they'll think I'm going to steal their money or things like that."" Homeboy Industries has helped thousands of high-risk youths with a variety of free programs: mental health counseling, GED classes, job training and legal services. The program's motto: ""Nothing stops a bullet like a job."" Boyle says one of the key components of Homeboy Industries is compassion. ""What if we were to invest in gang members, rather than just seek to incarcerate our way out of this problem?"" Boyle wrote in his book, ""Tattoos on the Heart: the Power of Boundless Compassion."" Besides Homeboy Bakery, other small businesses that serve as a transitional employers for those ready to leave the gang life include Homegirl CafÃ© & Catering, Homeboy Silkscreen & Embroidery, and the Homeboy Cafe & Bakery in the American Airlines terminal at Los Angeles International Airport. Gang membership in L.A. is still going up, said civil rights attorney and gang prevention expert Connie Rice, but many gang members also want out, and Boyle's connection to the Catholic Church has made an impact among Latinos. ""Latino gangs are very different from African-American gangs in that if you are allowed to leave it's only if you are going to go with God,"" she said. ""The influence of the Catholic Church in the Latino culture is so powerful."" FabiÃ¡n Debora, who started out as a baker at Homeboy Bakery after leaving an East L.A. gang, is now lead substance-abuse counselor for Homeboy Industries. He said most gang members ""really want to have a life that is better and more stable, but they just don't know how to get out of the gang life."" ""But when a person has a reason to wake up in the morning and come to work .... they're already on a path for change,"" said Debora, who went through the program six years ago.

"(CNN) -- Authenticity has become one of those buzzwords that we love to hate. Like many other words that have met a similar fate after being co-opted, misused, and overused, authenticity entered the popular lexicon because it tapped into something powerful in our culture. Having spent the past decade studying human behavior and the thoughts and emotions that drive it, I would guess that the concept of authenticity tapped into our yearning for more genuine and sincere connection and for less manipulation and pretending. It doesn't matter if we're talking about politics, work, school, family life, or our kids' soccer games -- we've grown tired of being hustled. Watch BrenÃ© Brown's TED Talk: Listening to shame . Unfortunately, hustling didn't fall out of favor the same way the word authenticity did, leading me to believe that a conversation about what it really means to be authentic could be helpful. I think the conversation is more important than the buzzword issue. And I don't buy the criticism that if you have to talk about authenticity, you're not being authentic. To me, that's a lot like saying, ""If you have to ask how much it costs, you can't afford it."" Well, the folks I know who have lots of money always ask how much something costs before they buy it. The fear of being perceived as unable to afford the new shoes is what gets us into trouble. The same is true with this conversation -- fear keeps us silent, but I don't see a lot of evidence that not talking about authenticity has given us much clarity about what it means to stop pretending, pleasing, and performing. TED.com: Thandie Newton on ""embracing otherness"" Before I started doing my research, I always thought of people as being either authentic or inauthentic. Authenticity was simply a quality that you had or that you were lacking. I think that's the way most of us use the term: ""He's a very authentic person."" But as I started immersing myself in the research, I realized that like many desirable ways of being, authenticity is not something we have or don't have. It's a practice -- a conscious choice of how we want to live. Authenticity is actually a collection of choices, choices that we make every day. It's the choice to show up and be real. The choice to be honest. The choice to let our true selves be seen. Some people consciously practice being authentic, and some people don't, and then there are the rest of us who are authentic on some days and not so authentic on other days. Trust me, even though I know plenty about authenticity and it's something I work toward, if I'm feeling too vulnerable or I've been trapped in a shame spiral of ""never good enough,"" I can sell myself out in a second and be anybody you need me to be. TED.com: BrenÃ© Brown on the power of vulnerability . Given the magnitude of the task at hand -- to be authentic in a culture that teaches us that being imperfect is synonymous with being inadequate -- I decided to use my research to better understand the anatomy of authenticity. What emerged from the data as the most powerful elements of building authenticity were understanding that authenticity is a choice and a practice -- having the courage to be vulnerable, and engaging with the world from a place of worthiness rather than a place of shame or ""never enough."" When I started thinking about what it really means to practice authenticity, I realized that choosing ""being real"" over ""being liked"" is all about playing it unsafe. It means stepping out of our comfort zone. And believe me, as someone who has stepped out on many occasions, you're likely to get knocked around when you're wandering through new territory. TED.com: The Web's secret stories . It's easy to attack and criticize someone while he or she is taking a risk -- voicing an unpopular opinion, or sharing a new creation with the world, or trying something new that he or she hasn't quite mastered. Cruelty is cheap and rampant -- especially when you attack and criticize anonymously, as technology and the Internet allow so many people to do these days. If you're like me, practicing authenticity can be a daunting choice -- there's risk involved in putting your true self out in the world. But I believe there's even more risk in hiding yourself and your gifts from the world. Our unexpressed ideas, opinions, and contributions don't just go away. They are likely to fester inside and eat away at our sense of worthiness. However afraid we are of change, the question that we must ultimately answer is this: What's the greater risk? Letting go of what people think, or letting go of how I feel and what I believe and who I am? e. e. cummings wrote, ""To be nobody but yourself in a world which is doing its best, night and day, to make you everybody but yourself means to fight the hardest battle which any human being can fight and never stop fighting."" I'm convinced that choosing authenticity is one of the most courageous battles that we'll ever fight.

"Princeton, New Jersey (CNN) -- The outcome of the election of 2012 is becoming even tougher to predict, since there are many political landmines facing both parties. President Barack Obama has enjoyed a resurgence in his political standing, with polls showing him ahead of the GOP rivals in hypothetical matchups for the general election. Recent statistics showing an improving economy have bolstered the president's position, while his budget proposal and increasingly populist rhetoric have generated some excitement within the base of the Democratic Party. On the Republican side, Mitt Romney remains the front-runner, though barely, still enjoying the kind of edge in campaign contributions that is essential to victory. Yet both candidates, and both parties, are confronting threats that could cause huge swings in the outcome of the election. The Democratic challenges come from outside the party. For Obama, the biggest threat is Europe. Even though leaders have put bailout plans in place and nations have started to grapple with their budget problems, the governments of Greece, Italy and other nations remain fiscally unstable. If any of these countries should default, they could trigger the kind of financial chaos in world markets that could doom Obama's re-election bid. The problem for the White House is that there are limits to what the U.S. can do other than watch as European governments struggle to resolve this collective problem. Another lurking problem is Iran. As tensions keep escalating with the Iranian government, and between the Israelis and Iranians, the potential for an international crisis is clear. If the situation deteriorates, the politics could move in ether direction. On the one hand, there could be a rally-around-the-leader effect, bolstering the case for keeping Obama in office. Or it could open the president up to attack from the right if his handling of the crisis is questionable. The administration must also wait to see what the Supreme Court decides on the president's health care plan. The court is expected to decide by early summer on the constitutionality of mandating that people must have health insurance. If it decides that the individual mandate is constitutional, the decision would greatly strengthen the president's political position. But if the Supreme Court says this key portion of the plan is unconstitutional, the decision would lend support to Republicans who have criticized the president for expanding the role of government. Even if a negative decision energized the base of the Democratic Party, dismantling Obama's key policy accomplishment would be devastating to the White House. Republicans face huge threats as well. Continued improvement in the economy would undercut Republican criticism about how the president has handled the marketplace. But the most difficult threat for the GOP comes from within the party. Republicans are now engaged in a brutal, fratricidal war. Few anticipated the effect that Newt Gingrich would have in this contest. For years, Democrats were known as the party unable to control its internal feuding. Republicans typically gave the nomination to the person who had waited patiently in line, while Democrats acted like a dysfunctional family that was just as eager to destroy itself as they were to take on their GOP opponents. This year, Gingrich and Rick Santorum have thrown a wrench into the Republican machine. Although some commentators focus on Gingrich's background as a professor, what is equally important is Gingrich the ruthless politician, who takes no prisoners and persists in battle until he no longer can. Despite all the warnings that he has faced about the impact of his take-no-prisoners campaign against Romney, Gingrich has continued to launch political attacks on the Republican front-runner. Santorum has joined him in further wounding the former Massachusetts governor. Romney, once seen as the most electable Republican, has seen his image transformed into a flip-flopping, liberal, vulture capitalist who might not even win in his own home state of Michigan. The outcome of South Carolina and Minnesota contradicted the claim that he is the candidate who inevitably wins. He didn't. Santorum and Gingrich have effectively painted Romney as the ""establishment Republican"" despite the fact that they have been central to the party's leadership since the 1990s. Given the current delegate count, and possible victories by Gingrich in Ohio and Santorum in Michigan, Republicans could be looking at a messy convention where these battles and tensions play out just before the fall campaign. The Republicans could face the kind of raucous convention that Democrats suffered through in 1968 when internal divisions brought down the party and gave Richard Nixon a commanding edge in the general election. The situation is so unstable that the notion of a new candidate such as Sarah Palin or Chris Christie entering the mix is no longer impossible -- a throwback to the smoke-filled-room era of party politics where decisions were made at the convention. Nor can we rule out the chance of a third-party run that would siphon off GOP votes. The uncertainty of the contest is likely to make for an extremely bruising campaign this fall, one that could leave both sides deeply wounded and generate even more bitter feelings within two parties whose members already detest each other. In short, we're likely to face a campaign where events will continue to create the possibility of huge swings, dramatic twists and turns and rapid changes in the fortunes of all the candidates.

"Near Flagstaff, Arizona (CNN) -- As one of hundreds of evacuees in Arizona's raging wildfire, Serena Chesmore valued family over home. She ensured the safety of the most precious things in the world: her family and pets. Her house in Kachina Village, after all, is replaceable, Chesmore said Friday. ""The kids, the pets, the photos -- they can't be replaced,"" Chesmore said. Chesmore is hoping, nonetheless, that 960 firefighters will be able to save her house and 300 other homes and businesses from an Arizona forest fire roaring through park land. She made an early jump on a pre-evacuation notice given to about 3,200 residents in Coconino County. The online Incident Information System reported Friday night that much of the fire burned with lower intensity throughout the day, allowing firefighters to make some progress. However, despite that progress, the total area scorched climbed to 8,500 acres that night, and the containment level held steady at 5%. The equivalent of a battalion of firefighters, including 15 hotshot crews and three air tankers, have been fighting the fire between Flagstaff and Sedona -- a tourist and retirement destination famed for its red rock formations -- since Tuesday afternoon. Firefighters face rough conditions . Tony Sciacca, a fire incident commander, says it's been an uphill battle for the firefighters battling the blaze. ""They're engaged in tough terrain, cutting vegetation, applying fire to the landscape as they need to in burnout operations,"" Sciacca said. Area residents took to Facebook on Friday to thank them. ""Thank you again for your tireless work on this monster,"" Mavis Kimball posted to the Slide Fire Information Facebook page. ""We who call this place home so appreciate you."" ""So thankful the best of the best are here on the Slide Fire,"" wrote Terry Schneider. Dust-dry pine needles, high winds and steep slopes have made for ideal conditions for the fire to spread rapidly, fire officials say. And it has. The flames that investigators fear were ignited by human hands appear to have consumed hundreds of acres in a few hours' time, according to officials. The wind has blasted vigorously and erratically through fiery gulches, with gusts up to 30 mph, but has not blown towards the populated Flagstaff area. Alaska wildfire . Meanwhile, in Alaska, a much larger fire that began burning Monday was 15% contained by Friday evening, Alaska's Interagency Incident Management Team said. The Funny River Fire had consumed nearly 67,084 acres of Alaska's Kenai National Wildlife Refuge by Friday night. It has so far posed less of a threat to humans than the one burning in Arizona: no evacuations or injuries have been reported. There were more than 370 firefighters battling the blaze. Officials say access to the fire is difficult. Investigators suspect human action was the cause, but this is still under investigation.

"New York (CNN) -- Prosecutors on Thursday dropped a drug possession with intent to sell charge against a musician who was arrested earlier this year in connection with the heroin overdose death of actor Philip Seymour Hoffman. In return, Robert Aaron Vineberg pleaded guilty to a lesser charge, according to the Manhattan District Attorney's office. He will serve no jail time. Vineberg will be sentenced October 14 to five years of probation, forfeiture of $1,284 confiscated from his apartment after his arrest and 25 days of community service, said Joan Vollero, director of communications for the Manhattan District Attorney's office. Vineberg also will attend an outpatient drug treatment program. Vineberg, who is from Canada, could face immigration consequences in light of his felony plea to criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fourth degree, Vollero said. He was originally also charged with third-degree criminal possession of a controlled substance, which included intent to sell. Vineberg was among four people arrested in Manhattan in the days after Hoffman's death. Prosecutors said Vineberg had just under 50 small bags of heroin as well as packaging paraphernalia in his apartment during a raid. Additionally, 250 small bags of heroin were found in another of Vineberg's apartments in the same building, prosecutors said. Vineberg, 58, was found to have the actor's phone number stored in his phone, a law enforcement official told CNN. Calls to Vineberg's lawyer were not immediately returned. The guilty plea comes the same day that the city's health department released 2013 data showing that heroin overdose deaths have doubled since 2010 in New York City. The city's health department said that 77% of drug overdose deaths in 2013 involved an opioid, including opioid analgesics (prescription painkillers), methadone or heroin.

"(CNN) -- A team of medical examiners has ruled that Oklahoma death row prisoner Clayton Lockett died from the state's lethal injection and not by heart attack. The report, which was released Thursday by the Oklahoma Department of Corrections, called the manner of death a ""judicially ordered execution."" The controversial April 29 execution of Lockett, who was convicted in 1999 of murder and rape, took 43 minutes from the time he was first injected. Witnesses described the man convulsing and writhing on the gurney, as well as struggling to speak, before officials blocked the witnesses' view. The execution was halted, but Lockett eventually died. The botched lethal injection catapulted the issue of U.S. capital punishment back into the international spotlight, raising new questions about the drugs being used and the constitutional protection against cruel and unusual punishment. Death penalty Fast Facts . Many needle marks . The report said there were numerous attempts to start an IV because it was difficult to find ""intravenous access sites."" There were at least 15 needle marks on Lockett's body, according to the autopsy, which was conducted by the Dallas-based Southwestern Institute of Forensic Sciences. An attorney who represents a group of Oklahoma death row prisoners who have commissioned an independent autopsy said the state-sponsored exam failed to answer one vital question. ""What this initial autopsy report does not appear to answer is what went wrong during Mr. Lockett's execution,"" Dale Baich said, adding that more information is needed. He thinks that will be discovered in an independent autopsy. Oklahoma Department of Corrections Director Robert Patton said in April that Lockett had died of a heart attack, but there was no support for that statement in the autopsy. The Oklahoma Department of Public Safety said Thursday it is wrapping up an investigation that was ordered by Oklahoma Gov. Mary Fallin. The findings will be revealed next week. Time: Every execution in U.S. history . New drug cocktails . Thirty-two U.S. states have the death penalty, as does the U.S. government and the U.S. military. Since 2009, three states -- New Mexico, Connecticut, and Maryland -- have voted to abolish it. States that have capital punishment have been forced to find new drugs to use since European-based manufacturers banned U.S. prisons from using theirs for executions. One of those manufacturers is the Danish company Lundbeck, maker of pentobarbital. Earlier this year, a convicted murderer and rapist in Ohio, Dennis McGuire, appeared to gasp and convulse for at least 10 minutes before dying from the drug cocktail used in his execution. Lockett's execution was the first time Oklahoma had used midazolam as the first element in its three-drug cocktail. The drug is generally used for children ""before medical procedures or before anesthesia for surgery to cause drowsiness, relieve anxiety and prevent any memory of the event,"" the U.S. National Library of Medicine said. ""It works by slowing activity in the brain to allow relaxation and sleep."" Lockett was convicted in 2000 of a bevy of crimes that left Stephanie Nieman dead and two people injured. The trouble with Lockett's execution prompted the state to delay the planned execution of Charles Warner from May to November. In a CNN/ORC poll earlier this year, 50% of Americans said the penalty for murder in general should be death, while 45% said it should be a life sentence. The survey's sampling error made that a statistical tie. Fifty-six percent of men supported the death penalty for murder in general, while 45% of women did. A Gallup poll last year found 62% of Americans believe the death penalty is morally acceptable, while half as many, 31%, consider it morally wrong.

"(CNN) -- The Environmental Protection Agency recently finalized a rule that for the first time requires U.S. coal and oil-fired power plant operators to limit emissions of mercury and other hazardous air pollutants. EPA rules in place under the 1990 Clean Air Act have targeted acid rain and smog-forming chemicals emitting from power plants. But perhaps surprising to many, those rules have never included limits on mercury, a neurotoxin known to damage developing fetuses and children. How this policy affects your health . The benefits of this new rule, in terms of dollars saved and death prevented, far outweigh the costs to companies and consumers, according to peer-reviewed EPA studies. U.S. power plants account for only about 1% of global mercury emissions. Even so, for each dollar spent reducing mercury and hazardous air pollutant emissions under the new rule, the EPA projects up to $9 in health benefit savings by preventing an estimated 11,000 premature deaths and 4,700 heart attacks each year. Among children, the new limits are projected to prevent 130,000 cases of asthma and 6,300 cases of acute bronchitis each year, the EPA estimates. ""These standards rank among the three or four most significant environmental achievements in the EPA's history,"" said John Walke, Clean Air director of the National Resources Defense Council, an environmental advocacy group. ""This rule making represents a generational achievement."" Despite federal limits on emissions of mercury from other sources, such as waste incinerators, there have been no limits on coal-fired power plants, which the EPA says constitute the single largest source of mercury emissions. ""As a mom, I'm especially excited to know that millions of mothers and babies will now be protected from mercury poisoning,"" said Mary Anne Hitt, director of Beyond Coal Campaign, a clean energy advocacy group. ""We all teach our kids the simple rule that if you make a mess you should clean it up - and now polluters will have to follow that same rule,"" she wrote in an e-mail conversation. ""Mothers around the country who have been worried about mercury pollution causing learning disabilities and other problems for their kids will be able to sleep easier tonight."" Health experts have known for a long time that mercury causes damage to developing fetuses, with long-term effects on the child. Methylmercury, found in fish and shellfish, can harm a child's thinking, language, fine motor skills, memory, attention, and visual spatial skills when exposed in the womb. One study estimates that for each part per million of mercury found in a mother's hair -- a common way of testing for mercury exposure -- her child loses approximately 0.18 IQ points. Outbreaks of methylmercury poisoning have resulted in some children being born with severe disabilities, even when their mothers did not show signs of nervous system damage. But adults are at risk for mercury poisoning too; symptoms can include impairment of vision, speech, hearing and walking. In addition to mercury, the new EPA rule also limits emissions of hazardous air pollutants like arsenic, benzene, chromium, formaldehyde, hydrochloric acid, and nickel. How to protect against mercury exposure . Once airborne, mercury enters bodies of water through precipitation, becomes methylmercury, and accumulates in the food chain. The EPA and the Food and Drug Administration recommend that pregnant women and young children limit their consumption of fish and shellfish to two meals a week, because the methylmercury contamination found in fish can cause harm to humans. The EPA and FDA say that some larger predatory fish, such as shark, swordfish, king mackerel, and tilefish, should be avoided entirely by pregnant women and children. Exposure can also occur from breathing in polluted air, for example near incinerators and coal-burning power plants. A lab test using blood or hair samples can determine the amount of methylmercury in the body. What's the controversy? The new rule requires that the vast majority of mercury contained in coal be captured and prevented from releasing into the air when burned for energy. It would require operators to shut down or upgrade the most environmentally dangerous power plants. Power plant operators have three years to comply with the new standards, but plant operators may be granted additional time to install the necessary emissions improvement technologies if they are able to demonstrate a valid need. Not everyone supports the new limits, in part because the new rules will increase costs for plant operators who need to make upgrades. The rule has been criticized by industry groups and some Republicans. ""Analyses predict EPA's rules will force the premature retirement of power plants that are needed to provide affordable, reliable power to consumers and our growing economy,"" said Fred Upton, the chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee. ""Other plants will require multi-million dollar retrofits that will result in higher electricity bills,"" said the Republican congressman from Michigan. The EPA states that its rule is cost-effective and ""ensures electric reliability,"" noting that the agency has received more than 900,000 comments from industry and the public to better inform the decision. Amid a divisive political climate and persistent unemployment, the EPA noted in its March 2011 rule proposal that it ""finds that more jobs will be created in the air pollution control technology production field than may be lost as the result of compliance with these proposed rules."" The final EPA rule regulating power plant mercury emissions has been decades in the making. The 1990 version of the Clean Air Act signed into law by President George H.W. Bush directed the EPA to conduct studies to determine whether regulating mercury and other hazardous air pollutants from power plants was ""appropriate and necessary."" In December 2000, having completed the required studies, the EPA formally announced its intention to regulate mercury emissions from power plants. Then in 2005, under the administration of President George W. Bush, the EPA reversed its determination that mercury regulations were ""appropriate and necessary,"" and removed power plants from the list of sources to be regulated. Instead the Bush-era EPA proposed the ""Clean Air Mercury Rule,"" a cap-and-trade system for mercury emissions. Under ""cap and trade,"" mercury emissions would not be restricted, but heavy polluters would pay a fee that could be pocketed by companies whose factories or power plants pollute less. In February 2009, the new EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson announced a return to the 2000 decision to put limits on mercury emissions. The rule proposed on March 2011 was made final in an announcement on December 21 at the Children's Medical Center in Washington. Altogether, the environmental regulations beginning with the 1970 Clean Air Act have saved millions of American lives, according to the EPA. The reductions in fine particle and ozone pollution emissions mandated under the 1990 Clean Air Act prevented more than 160,000 cases of premature mortality, 130,000 heart attacks, and 1.7 million asthma attacks in just the year 2010, according to EPA figures.","The new limits are projected to prevent 130,000 cases of asthma, 6,300 cases of bronchitis .

"(CNN) -- An armed group detained 43 U.N. peacekeepers in Syria near the country's only border crossing with the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights early Thursday, a day after militants took the crossing from the Syrian regime, the United Nations said. Those holding the peacekeepers are members of the al Qaeda-linked al-Nusra Front, one of the groups fighting the regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, an Israeli military official told CNN on condition of anonymity. ""The United Nations is making every effort to secure the release of the detained peacekeepers, and to restore the full freedom of movement of the force throughout its area of operation,"" the U.N. said in a news release. The 43 peacekeepers, all from Fiji, are part of a U.N. operation that has been in the Golan Heights area since 1974, charged with maintaining a ceasefire between Syrian and Israeli forces since a 1973 war, the United Nations said. They were detained Thursday morning near the Syrian town of Quneitra, the location of the border crossing that rebels had captured, according to the United Nations. In addition, 81 U.N. peacekeepers from the Philippines were being ""restricted to their positions"" Thursday near villages in the area, the U.N. said without elaborating. Al-Nusra Front fighters and other Syrian rebels seized control of the Syrian side of the Quneitra crossing Wednesday -- a capture that represents a new dynamic in a war long feared not only for its deadly effects inside Syria but for threatening to widen into a destabilizing regional conflict. Fighting appeared to continue Thursday. From the Israeli-occupied side of the Golan Heights, a CNN crew could hear intense small-arms fire coming from the old town of Quneitra around noon. The crew also could see gunmen -- apparently rebels -- at a checkpoint on the Syrian side of the crossing. A Syrian flag that had been at the checkpoint was no longer there. The Israeli military has closed the area it controls around the border crossing. Cross-border shelling . During the fighting Wednesday between Syrian forces and rebels, three errant mortar rounds and some small-arms fire crossed into Israeli-controlled territory, Israeli military spokesman Lt. Col. Peter Lerner said. An Israeli military officer was moderately injured, the military said on Twitter, and Israeli forces responded by striking two Syrian military positions. An activist in the Golan Heights, Shamil al-Jolani, said rebel fighters reached the crossing Wednesday despite bombardment by Syrian warplanes. Because of agreements with Israel, Syrian forces could not bomb the forces at the crossing, he said. The Islamist group Ahrar al-Sham al-Islamiya and other rebel groups, not all of them Islamist, also were involved in the fighting, Jolani said. The border crossing made headlines earlier this week, when the al-Nusra Front handed over American journalist Peter Theo Curtis to U.N. peacekeepers on the Syrian side of the checkpoint. The al-Nusra Front is a fierce rival to another Sunni Muslim extremist group in Syria, ISIS, which calls itself the ""Islamic State"" and has been fighting in Iraq to establish an Islamic caliphate across both countries. Both al-Nusra Front and ISIS have been fighting the Assad regime and each other in Syria, opposition groups have said, with ISIS gaining control of a large portion of northern and eastern Syria. Wednesday's fighting marked at least the second time rebels have attacked the crossing. In June 2013, rebels and Syrian forces battled for control of Quneitra. The violence prompted Austrian troops to pull out of a United Nations peacekeeping force in the Golan Heights. Israel sent tanks and troops to the border for a time, as well. Armed groups also detained U.N. peacekeepers in the area in March and May of 2013, but they eventually were released safely, the United Nations says. Israel seized control of the Golan Heights during the 1967 Six-Day War and fought off an attempt by Syria in 1973 to retake the rocky plateau. In 1981, Israel annexed the Golan Heights. It is considered to be occupied territory by the international community. Syria rebel group's dangerous ties to al Qaeda . Who is the ISIS?

"(EW.com) -- First the good news: Paramount's $5 million found footage horror sequel ""Paranormal Activity 4"" easily led the box office with $30.2 million in its first three days. Now for the bad news: That's 43 percent less (i.e. $22.4 million less) than ""Paranormal Activity 3"" earned in its debut frame, and 26 percent less ($10.5 million) than ""Paranormal Activity 2"" managed. Fortunately for Paramount, the tiny cost of the Paranormal films still make them highly profitable, but the sharp drop off from ""PA3"" to ""PA4"" could spell trouble for the franchise. ""Paranormal Activity 4,"" which received a ""C"" CinemaScore grade from polled audiences, has received the worst reviews of any entry in the series, yet Paramount chose to open it earlier than its predecessors. The film was released on Thursday night at 9 p.m. â ""PA2"" and ""PA3"" opened at midnight â and perhaps negative word-of-mouth spread faster and earlier, thus limiting its weekend prospects. Also making matters difficult was direct competition from Sinister, the similarly themed horror title that opened to $18 million last weekend. One thing is certain: ""Paranormal Activity 4"" is going to have a front-loaded run. The picture fell by a whopping 38 percent from Friday ($15.1 million) to Saturday ($9.4 million) â never a sign of box office longevity. Furthermore, horror movies â and especially horror sequels â are typically some of the most front-loaded films of any genre due to young audiences (60 percent of PA4's audience was below the age of 25), who rush to the theater on opening weekend. ""PA2"" and ""PA3"" each finished with about twice as much as they earned on opening weekend, grossing $84.8 and $104 million respectively, but ""PA4"" will be lucky to score $60 million total. Still, this isn't a shameful result â the film only cost $5 million, and its $8,851 per theater average was the best in the Top 20 â but it's certainly an underwhelming one. If ""Paranormal Activity 4's"" box office take felt less than impressive, ""Argo's"" sophomore frame seemed just the opposite. Warner Bros.' $45 million Ben Affleck-directed spy thriller dropped only 15 percent in its second weekend to $16.6 million, thereby lifting its total to $43.2 million after 10 days. The Oscar front-runner, which earned an amazing ""A+"" CinemaScore grade last weekend, has a decent shot at breaking $100 million at the domestic box office if it can keep scoring remarkable holds like this one. Third place went to ""Hotel Transylvania,"" which is demonstrating impressive staying power as Halloween approaches. Sony's $85 million kiddie flick dropped 22 percent this weekend to $13.5 million, giving the film a terrific $119 million total. In just a few days, ""Hotel"" will become the young Sony Pictures Animation's most successful film ever domestically, surpassing ""Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs'"" $124.9 million gross. In fourth, ""Taken 2"" dropped by 39 percent (a better hold than last weekend's 56 percent decline) to $13.4 million. After 17 days, Fox's Liam Neeson vehicle has grossed an impressive $106 million, and although it appears likely that Taken 2 will fall a bit short of the $145 million domestic finish that the original ""Taken"" earned domestically, Fox certainly isn't worried. The studio spent just $45 million on the film, and it is a hit around the world â it took two weeks to outgross its predecessor overseas and has now grossed $240.9 million globally â and talks have reportedly already begun for ""Taken 3."" Summit's Alex Cross fared badly in fifth place. The thriller, which stars the oft-cross-dressing Madea-director Tyler Perry in the title role, grossed $11.8 million, the worst debut ever for a film starring Perry and the worst debut ever in the Alex Cross series. Morgan Freeman formerly played the action star, based on a popular character in James Patterson's series of novels, in 1997â²s ""Kiss the Girls"" and 2001â²s ""Along Came A Spider,"" which opened with $13.2 million and $16.7 million, respectively. Alex Cross, which cost Summit and QED Entertainment about $23 million to make, played to a typical Tyler Perry crowd. Audiences were 60 percent female, 68 percent above the age of 35, and 74 percent African-American, and although relatively few people saw the film, those that did liked what they saw, issuing it an ""A"" CinemaScore grade. Maybe if the film had been called Tyler Perry's Alex Cross, it could have started a bit better. 1. Paranormal Activity 4 -- $30.2 million . 2. Argo -- $16.6 million . 3. Hotel Transylvania -- $13.5 million . 4. Taken 2 -- $13.4 million . 5. Alex Cross -- $11.8 million . Two more box office shout-outs. ""Looper"" has quietly grown into a solid mid-level hit. After four weekends, the TriStar sci-fi thriller has earned $57.8 million and it will pass $60 million this week. Meanwhile, Oscar contender ""The Sessions"" opened successfully in limited release in New York and Los Angeles this weekend, taking in $121,000 from four theaters, giving it an impressive $30,250 per theater average. The film will add nine theaters to its run next weekend.

"(CNN) -- And then there were two. One is identified with the ethnic Tajik group from northern Afghanistan and is a former foreign minister who later became a critic of Afghan President Hamid Karzai. The other is close to the president and belongs to his Pashtun ethnic group. Both are technocrats who campaigned on a message of change. And each hopes to lead their turbulent nation into a brighter future. Preliminary results from Afghanistan's landmark presidential elections show former Foreign Minister Abdullah Abdullah getting the most votes -- but not the majority needed to avoid a runoff with Ashraf Ghani Ahmadzai. The two men will face each other in a runoff slated for June 7, according to Afghanistan's Independent Election Commission. The preliminary results will be finalized May 14 after investigations into fraud complaints, according to commission. It's the third election since the fall of the Taliban in 2001, and marks the first democratic handover of power in the fragile country. Incumbent Hamid Karzai is constitutionally bound to step down. Karzai was once the darling of the West but has long since fallen out of favor amid cries of corruption and cronyism. With NATO troops scheduled to pull out of Afghanistan by the end of the year, and following the refusal of Karzai to sign a bilateral agreement -- the so-called Status of Forces Agreement -- with the United States to keep some troops in-country, Afghan security is in the hands of the next man to be sworn in. CNN takes a look at the two contenders to be Afghanistan's next leader. Abdullah Abdullah . An ophthalmologist and former Northern Alliance medic in a previous life, Abdullah was a vocal critic of the Taliban during their years in power, and although he was a previous Karzai ally, serving in his government as foreign minister, he has in later years been a thorn in the side of the man who has ruled Afghanistan since the fall of the Taliban in 2001. The urbane politician, known for his eloquence -- and his elegance -- took on Karzai in 2009's election but dropped out after the first round in protest to what he saw as large-scale voter fraud. His campaign this time around has been wracked with violence, with three separate attacks by militants on Abdullah campaigners in the weeks before the election, according to the Afghan news agency, Khaama. ""The environment is not risk-free, but when I look at the enthusiasm of the Afghan people to participate in the elections -- that is part of it is encouraging. It is highly encouraging,"" he told CNN's Christiane Amanpour earlier this year. As with many countries, both democratic and otherwise, loyalty along ethnic lines matters a great deal in Afghanistan. Pashtuns make up more than half of the population in this multi-ethnic country, with Tajiks the second-largest group, and a number of minor Turkic and other ethnic groups. Part Tajik and part Pashtun, Abdullah is considered a relative outsider given his background. He is generally associated with his Tajik side, giving him a possible advantage in reaching out to non-Pashtun voters, but which may work against him in a runoff if the other candidates back his Pashtun challenger. He is seen as a relatively liberal candidate and advocate of women's engagement in public life, telling Britain's Independent newspaper, ""If you want to see this country or any other country even being able to deal with the challenges and develop, it cannot happen without the role of half the population."" He has signaled his intention to sign the Status of Forces Agreement with President Barack Obama in an effort to offer his constituents some security following NATO''s planned withdrawal at the end of 2014. Ashraf Ghani Ahmadzai . A former academic who previously taught at Berkeley and Johns Hopkins University in the United States, Arshaf Ghani emerged as the dark horse candidate. A former U.S. citizen who gave up his passport to run for the Afghan presidency in 2009, he's known as having an impatient, fiery temper but also of being incredibly detail-oriented. Another ex-Karzai man, Ghani served as both an adviser to the current president and also as finance minister in his cabinet. He was working at the World Bank in Washington, D.C. during the September 11 attacks, and used the tragedy as a springboard for his re-engagement in Afghan politics, returning to his home country just months after the event. Considered a moderate, he says he has seen positive signs while campaigning around the country. ""(At) rally after rally people are responding to a message of moderation, to message of reform, to message of transformation, to peace, stability and cooperation,"" he told CNN's Anna Coren. WATCH: CNN's Christiane Amanpour interviews Ashraf Ghani . His experience in the development agency was invaluable during his time in Karzai's government, reconstructing the country, and he hopes voters will be convinced that it will stand him in equally good stead for the top job. A shrewd operator, Ghani, who is Pashtun, has enlisted the support of ex-warlord General Abdul Rashid Dostum, a native Uzbek, as his running mate. However, his many years in the United States -- especially while his countrymen were suffering, first under the yoke of Soviet imperialism and later the strictures of the Taliban -- may impede him as he is seen as an outsider with strong ties to the United States, which is seen by many as merely the latest foreign invaders of Afghan soil.","Abdullah Abdullah, Ashraf Ghani will be in a runoff slated for June 7 .

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- It was the music of rebellion and youth. Artists traded witty improvisations onstage chronicling the pain and the promise of being black in America, inspiring inner-city and rural Southern audiences alike in nightclubs and on street corners. Atlanta-based Jaspects fuses rap with jazz in hopes of preserving both genres and appealing to young people. That music was jazz. Today, Jaspects, an Atlanta-based group of young musicians who were born in the hip-hop era, fuse rap and jazz melodies to introduce younger audiences to jazz and the broader ideas regarding African-American society. For Jaspects, whose music has appeared in the movie ""Hustle & Flow"" and recently was featured in the CNN documentary series ""Black in America,"" the lessons of jazz go beyond its artistic merits to questions about the ownership and control of black music in general. Veteran saxophonist Jimmy Heath, who has performed with nearly all the jazz greats of the last 50 years, says that the music called jazz today began as a voice of the repressed. ""The history of jazz comes with the history of African-American people. Because whenever they were permitted, they always sang and played their music when they were in their own quarters, and eventually I think, when instruments were available, they started to play music on those instruments,"" Heath says. Jazz was born a raw and energetic rebuttal of what was musically acceptable at the time, and became the voice of a generation of African-American youth.  Watch as Jaspect fuses hip-hop and jazz Â» . Terrence Brown, pianist and musical director for Jaspects, says hip-hop shares the same roots. ""These people wanted to do more than just Bach and Beethoven. They didn't want to play history; they wanted to make history,"" Brown says. ""I guess when jazz [and] the Harlem Renaissance began to give birth people really felt the need to express themselves and that is similar to how hip-hop was created."" As jazz started to gain popularity outside of black America in the 1940s and gained an international following, many say the music became distanced from its cultural origins. In his exhaustive work on the African-American experience, ""Africana,"" Harvard University professor Henry Louis Gates Jr. writes that while black musicians were the principal innovators during this era, white musicians often reaped the fame and benefits and that ""the black musicians who found greatest favor with whites were those with a happy-go-lucky air and a ready grin."" With the exception of groups such as Jaspects, jazz today is considered by Brown and some others to be a ""museum piece"" that aged instead of evolving. Brown says hip-hop is following a similar route, and he says a major reason is a lack of ownership of the music. ""Hopefully, there will come a time where a lot of African-Americans who do have money and do have the resources ... take over some of these corporations ... and not just have the No. 1 hit record on the charts, because that in itself will allow the community to give back to itself,"" Brown says. Rapper Nas, whose real name is Nasir Jones, made a provocative declaration with the release of his 2006 album, ""Hip Hop Is Dead,"" that the genre ""is dead because we no longer have the power."" At the same time, there has been a rise of prominent black music executives such as Sean ""P. Diddy"" Combs, Jay-Z, Russell Simmons and Jermaine Dupri. Jay-Z and P. Diddy, who earned $34 million and $32 million, respectively, in 2007, were named hip-hop's cash kings by Forbes magazine. Dupri, owner of record label So So Def Records and producer of hits for recording artists TLC, Usher and Mariah Carey, disagrees that corporate ownership is affecting black music for the worse. ""They [corporations] have their input, but if you let the money guide you then, that's how you let them control you,"" says Dupri, who released his first book in 2007, ""Young, Rich and Dangerous: The Making of a Music Mogul."" ""If you are driven by money, then the backers that are giving you the money tell you what to do."" Dupri says that there are not enough African Americans who are in control of the music business, and that education has a lot to do with it. ""That's a lot of the problem. It's always been something that lot of people can get in quick without really doing anything, without learning, but you have to learn everything about it,"" Dupri says. Brown says he's hopeful that the rise of black leadership in music will have a positive impact on the community. ""We need to get to a place where we own our own things as African-Americans and a place that the things we do generate money for our own communities,"" Brown says. ""Not only that, but that we generate a sense of culture, style and substance for our community."" Jaspects and groups like them are hoping to change things a little. Using hip-hop, the music of rebellion and youth in 2008, they are introducing jazz to a new generation -- to tell its story, preserve its artistry and learn its lessons.","Atlanta-based group Jaspects fuses rap, jazz to attract younger audiences .

"Camden, Maine (CNN) -- Want to help save the humpback whale? Pick up a camera and start taking pictures, says Gale McCullough, a ""fluke matcher"" at Allied Whale, a research group. McCullough is a citizen scientist -- a do-goodery term for volunteers who help collect data about the natural world -- who uses the photo-sharing site Flickr to catalog photos of whales. Not just any photos, though. She's specifically interested in the humpback's fluke, or the tail. On humpbacks, the underside of the fluke carries unique identifying information in the form of a splotchy black and white pattern. This can be used to tell one whale from another, much the way fingerprints work for humans. McCullough spends time looking through these whale-tail photos and matching them to each other. Combining that data with dates, she and other scientists can track a particular whale's movement over time, giving each of these enormous marine mammals a story that otherwise would be unknown. To learn more about the whales, however, more photos are needed. ""If you go whale watching, take a camera,"" she said in an interview on a boat off the coast of Maine, where she was speaking to a group of people attending the annual PopTech conference. ""And then put it on Flickr. I'll find it."" The conclusions scientists draw from these amateur photos are not insignificant. Last year, for example, McCullough -- a spry, gray-haired woman who wears tinted glasses that nearly cover her face and an orange jacket bright enough to make onlookers wish they had tinted lenses of their own -- did a casual Flickr search and noticed that a particular humpback whale, No. 1363 in the official whale catalog, had been spotted by a man who was on vacation in Madagascar. Two years before that photo was taken, the same whale was seen off the coast of Brazil, some 6,000 miles away. That migration route was longer than any that had been recorded for a single humpback, according to a journal article that cited the finding. ""This observation is altogether unprecedented,"" Peter Stevick, a marine biologist at College of the Atlantic, and author of that article, told Wired Science. ""There are only a few humpback whales that have been seen in more than one breeding ground before this, and they moved to relatively nearby areas -- eastern to western Australia, eastern to western Africa, for example."" ""We have to rearrange the way we feel about the ocean now,"" McCullough said in 2010. With more photos to comb through, more discoveries could be made, she said. She encouraged anyone who goes on a whale-watching trip to try to take photographs of the whale's fluke. Wait much longer than you think you should to click the shutter, though, because the fluke becomes visible just before the whale dives back down into the ocean, she said. If you upload the photos to a public photo-sharing website -- Flickr is just one of many -- and tag them with a date and location, then scientists may be able to use that photo to track the whale on its journeys through the ocean. McCullough said photos of whales in South Africa and Madagascar are particularly needed. Taking a photo of a whale can be the start of a lifelong learning experience, she said. ""Whales are a great way to take people down into the ocean.""","Volunteers match and analyze whale photos on Flickr .

"(CNN) -- Goalkeeper Tim Howard says the explosion of interest in soccer in the United States is ""mind-blowing"" off the back of Team USA's surprise progression from the World Cup ""Group of Death"" to the last 16. Few gave the U.S. team much chance of finishing in the top two from the likes of Germany, Portugal and Ghana, but it has defied the pundits to reach the knockout stages. Howard, who plays for Everton in the English Premier League, has been a key figure, making a string of fine saves to restrict group winners Germany to a 1-0 win Thursday. It left Team USA tied on four points with Portugal, but qualifying for a match against Belgium next Tuesday because of a superior goal difference. The 35-year-old veteran of 103 internationals had also been in top form as the U.S. tied Portugal 2-2 in its second group match, building on its 2-1 win over Ghana to start the tournament. The huge support in Brazil, an estimated four times as many U.S. fans as followed England's under achieving team, plus unprecedented scenes across America with fans crowding to watch games on big screens, has come as something of a surprise to New Jersey-born Howard. ""The fact that it has really swept the nation is incredible for us as American players to see that,"" he told CNN. ""The interest has been mind-blowing and we've enjoyed watching every second of YouTube clips and Instagram and Twitter,"" ""We've come so far in a short period of time. You know, the sport in our country really isn't that old,"" he added. Howard also believes coach Jurgen Klinsmann has been vindicated for his selections after coming under fire before the start of the World Cup for leaving out fan favorite Landon Donovan and picking four German-born players in his squad. ""He's from day one made a lot of bold, powerful decisions. Some people call it cutthroat even,"" he said. ""But he's strong in his decision making, and that's what a leader has to be. You can never waver."" Klinsmann said Friday he was ""optimistic"" striker Jozy Altidore will return from injury to play against Belgium after sustaining a hamstring injury in the win over Ghana. Another key player, midfielder Jermaine Jones, has also been cleared to play despite breaking his nose in the narrow loss to Germany. Howard believes they can provide another upset to beat Belgium, which won all of its three group matches, building on the momentum of earlier performances. ""We have a lot of other things we want to do, starting with Belgium, but you know we're proud of ourselves. We worked hard. ""It was the Group of Death, and people didn't give us a lot of a chance. We have to believe we can do it,"" he added. Howard -- who spent four years with Manchester United before transferring to Everton -- has become something of a cult hero, sporting a thick black beard in direct contrast to his shaven head. He had first grown it during the last EPL season and has changed his mind once or twice about its merits. ""It was my strength. I loved it, and then I cut it. I just cut it because I was tired of it. ""But I just decided to grow it back. There's never a rhyme or reason when I decide to grow it. It just happened."" Howard will be hoping it brings his side luck again when it faces Belgium, looking to reach the quarterfinals of a World Cup for the first time since 2002.","Team USA celebrating passage to last 16 of World Cup .

"(CNN) -- Three anti-whaling activists were injured in a clash with Japanese whalers off the coast of Antarctica on Wednesday when the Japanese crew used grappling hooks against pursuit boats, the conservation group Sea Shepherd said in statement. The environmental group claims two of its crew from the anti-whaling ship Steve Irwin were struck in the shoulder with iron grappling hooks and one crewmember was struck twice in the face with a long bamboo pole. The group said the incident occurred at about 3am (Australian Eastern Daylight Time) in waters 300 miles north of Mawson Peninsula in Antarctica. Sea Shepherd claims the Japanese whaler Yushin Maru No. 2 continued to tail the Steve Irwin which is in Antarctic waters attempting to disrupt the Japanese whalers. ""Our small boats were attempting to slow down the Japanese harpoon vessel Yushin Maru No. 2, which is aggressively tailing the Steve Irwin,"" said Captain Paul Watson. The group said that American crewmember Brian Race, 25, from New York, was jabbed twice in the face with a bamboo pole receiving lacerations above his right eye and on his nose. South African cameraman Russell Bergh, 35, and French photographer Guillaume Collet, 27, received deep bruising when the hooks struck them. Sea Shepherd said two of the three harpoon ships had been assigned to tail the Steve Irwin and its pursuit boats, effectively putting two of the three killing boats out of action.","Conservation group claims crew were attacked with grappling hooks .

"London (CNN) -- Foreign Secretary William Hague announced plans Tuesday for the United Kingdom to reopen its embassy in Tehran, Iran, which has been closed since an attack by protesters in 2011 triggered a dramatic breakdown in relations. Hague's announcement to Parliament follows a series of steps taken by both nations in recent months to improve ties. In a written statement to lawmakers, he said that, given the progress made, ""I have therefore now decided the circumstances are right to reopen our embassy in Tehran. ""There are a range of practical issues that we will need to resolve first. However it is our intention to reopen the Embassy in Tehran with a small initial presence as soon as these practical arrangements have been made."" Hague said his two chief concerns in making the decision had been whether UK Embassy staff would be safe and secure, and whether they would be able to work ""without hindrance."" He added, ""There has never been any doubt in my mind that we should have an embassy in Tehran if the circumstances allowed. Iran is an important country in a volatile region, and maintaining embassies around the world, even under difficult conditions, is a central pillar of the UK's global diplomatic approach."" The assault by student protesters on the UK Embassy and a separate diplomatic compound in Tehran in November 2011 prompted outrage in the United Kingdom and led Britain to close the embassy's doors and withdraw all its staff from Iran. Britain also closed the Iranian Embassy in London and ordered all Iranian diplomats to leave. The protest in Tehran was sparked by anger at UK sanctions imposed against Iranian institutions over Iran's nuclear program. The embassy buildings should have been guarded by Iranian security officers. Since the election of Iranian President Hassan Rouhani last year, there's been a more positive tone to Iran's interactions with the West. That relationship has taken on a new significance in light of the current crisis in Iraq, where Sunni militants have seized vast swaths of territory. Iran, a majority Shiite nation, is an ally of Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki's Shia-led government and has said it would provide help if asked. The United States, whose formal relations with Iran ended after the 1979 takeover of its embassy there, now faces the politically unpalatable option of cooperating with Tehran to stop gains by the militant group, the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS). The United States and Iran held ""very brief discussions"" about Iraq and the threat posed by ISIS in Vienna, Austria, on Monday, State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf said. Deputy Secretary of State William Burns is in Vienna for nuclear talks with Iran. CNN's Carol Jordan and Elaine Ly contributed to this report.","Foreign Secretary William Hague: ""Iran is an important country in a volatile region""

"(CNN) -- A Sudanese Christian woman who had been sentenced to die for refusing to renounce her faith and her husband were released from custody late Thursday, the two told CNN. Mariam Yehya Ibrahim and her husband, Daniel Wani, said that they were freed on bail but are prohibited from leaving the country. The pair had been detained after they arrived at an airport in Khartoum with their children on Tuesday. She is accused of two criminal counts, traveling with falsified documents and giving false information, according to Ibrahim's legal team. Ibrahim was trying to leave the African country for the United States with her family, her legal team said Wednesday. Daniel Wani was being held as an accessory, the lawyers said. The family was stopped at the airport after what Ibrahim's lawyers described Tuesday as an alleged ""irregularity with her documentation."" The U.S. State Department said Tuesday that Ibrahim and her family had been ""temporarily detained at the airport"" for questioning over issues relating to their travel and documentation. ""She and her family are in a safe location, and the Government of Sudan has assured us of the family's continued safety,"" U.S. State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf said Thursday, confirming that Ibrahim had been released on bail. Harf said that the U.S. Embassy ""remains highly engaged"" in the woman's case, saying ""we will provide more information as it becomes available consistent with privacy laws."" Sudanese authorities said Ibrahim had been detained because of the documents she submitted. Sudan's National Intelligence and Security Services said that she had South Sudanese travel documents despite not being a citizen of South Sudan, and she was heading to the United States, which is not her native country. ""This was considered illegal by the Sudanese authorities, who have summoned both the U.S. and South Sudanese ambassadors,"" the agency said in a message posted on its media Facebook page early Wednesday. The airport detention came a day after Ibrahim's legal team announced the 27-year-old woman had been released from prison after weeks of international controversy over her conviction on apostasy and adultery charges. According to her lawyer, the case began when one of Ibrahim's relatives, a Muslim, filed a criminal complaint saying her family was shocked to find out she had married Wani, a Christian, after she was missing for several years. The Sudanese court considered Ibrahim a Muslim because her father was Muslim, but she said she was a Christian and never practiced Islam. She was charged with adultery, because a Muslim woman's marriage to a Christian man is illegal in Sudan, and with apostasy, accused of illegally renouncing what was alleged to be her original faith.

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- Yitzhak Shamir, a political hard-liner who served two terms as Israeli prime minster, died Saturday, the prime minister's office said. Shamir, 96, served as premier from 1983 to 1984, and from 1986 to 1992. He also was Israel's foreign minister from 1980 to 1986. Born in Poland, Shamir moved to Palestine and fought for Israeli independence. He joined the Likud movement, serving as a member of Israel's parliament, and also worked for the Mossad, Israel's intelligence service. Shamir succeeded Menachem Begin as prime minister in 1983. ""Yitzhak Shamir belonged to the generation of giants who established the State of Israel and fought for the freedom of the Jewish people on their land,"" said Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, a fellow Likud member. It was during Shamir's second term as prime minister that the Gulf War broke out, leaving him with the question of how to respond to Iraqi Scud missiles falling on Israeli soil. Israeli government and military officials pressed him to retaliate and the United States urged him not to, and Shamir ultimately assured Washington he would not strike back. Shamir also presided over negotiations with Egypt on the post-treaty normalization process, and started diplomatic relations with several African countries that had severed relations with Israel after the Yom Kippur War, according to a biography of Shamir on the prime minister's website. Shamir ordered Operation Solomon, the airlift rescue of thousands of Ethiopian Jews following a regime change in 1991. During the operation, which took less than 48 hours, 14,000 Jews boarded Israeli planes to emigrate to Israel, according to the Israeli government. In September 1991, Shamir represented Israel at the International Peace Conference in Madrid. Israeli President Shimon Peres called Shamir a ""brave warrior."" ""He fought with courage against the British mandate in the days of the underground and his incredible contribution to the State of Israel during his time in the Mossad will remain forever enshrined in the tales of bravery of our nation,"" Peres said in a statement. Shamir was a leader of the Jewish Zionist underground group that fought the mandate in the 1940s. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said Shamir dedicated his life to Israel. ""From his days working for Israel's independence to his service as prime minister, he strengthened Israel's security and advanced the partnership between the United States and Israel,"" she said in a statement.

"(CNN) -- Three Russian tanks and other military vehicles crossed the border into Ukraine on Thursday, prompting a skirmish between Ukrainian and Russian forces, acting Ukrainian Interior Minister Arsen Avakov said. The Russian Foreign Ministry told the BBC that the claim was ""another fake piece of information."" According to Avakov, tanks crossed the border at a checkpoint controlled by pro-Russian separatists in the Luhansk region of eastern Ukraine. Armored vehicles and artillery were part of the columns, Avakov said, citing Ukrainian intelligence. Two of the tanks split off and headed in the direction of Gorlovka, also known as Horlivka, and were attacked by Ukrainian military forces, Avakov said. Part of that column was destroyed, he said. CNN has not independently confirmed the incidents. The countries have been engaged in a tense stand-off since March, when Russia annexed Crimea and massed troops along its border with Ukraine. U.S. officials said in late May that thousands of Russian troops had withdrawn from the border. Thousands more who remained appeared to be preparing to depart, U.S. officials said at the time. Western leaders have accused Moscow of fomenting instability in eastern Ukraine. Russian leaders say Ukraine has failed to move to implement a framework for peace worked out in Geneva, Switzerland, in April. They say Ukrainian leaders have carried out a campaign of violence against people living in the largely pro-Russian east. Also on Thursday, Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko and Russian President Vladimir Putin ""held a substantial and long phone conversation,"" the Ukrainian President's media office said, but it was unclear if that conversation occurred before or after the reported tank incursion.

On its website, the facility bills itself as an outpatient rehabilitation center for patients with traumatic brain injuries and says it plans to open a long-term care facility. According to her online biography posted on the facility's website, Scerri worked as a hair stylist for 25 years and founded the facility after her father sustained a traumatic brain injury in a motorcycle accident. ""We are aware of Jahi McMath's dire situation, and we are willing to open our outpatient facility to provide 24-hour care as an inpatient, long-term facility for Jahi with the required and appropriate medical staff that she depends upon,"" Scerri said in a letter included in court documents last week. Omari Sealey, Jahi's uncle, declined to comment on Scerri's remarks to CNN Sunday. He told CNN affiliate KGO Saturday that the family is closer than ever to securing the teen's relocation. ""We're moving in the right direction,"" Sealey said. ""We've had small victory after small victory, and it's all leading to the right direction."" At a court hearing Friday, Jahi's family and hospital officials agreed on a protocol for the release of the girl to another facility, but didn't specify where or when she'd be transferred. By court order, Jahi will stay on a ventilator until 5 p.m. Tuesday. The teen was declared brain dead on December 12, three days after doctors removed her tonsils, adenoids and extra sinus tissue. As a fierce court battle unfolded between devastated family members fighting to keep her on the ventilator and doctors arguing she'd already died, the case has drawn national attention and fueled debate. Doctors and a judge have declared her brain dead and said there's no chance Jahi will come back to life. ""Overall, unfortunate circumstances in 13-year-old with known, irreversible brain injury and now complete absence of cerebral function and complete absence of brainstem function, child meets all criteria for brain death, by professional societies and state of California,"" Dr. Paul Fisher, chief of pediatric neurology at Stanford University, said in a medical report on the case. Medical ethicists, meanwhile, say the high-profile case fuels a misperception: that ""brain death"" is somehow not as final as cardiac death, even though, by definition, it is. But family members have said they're holding out hope and want to transfer Jahi to another facility. So far the family has raised more than $47,000 on GoFundMe.com to move her. According to the site, more than 1,300 people have donated money in nine days. Scerri told CNN Sunday that the girl just needs to be given a chance to recover. ""Her brain needs time to heal. It's a new injury,"" Scerri said. ""We believe in life after injury, all of us here at New Beginnings have first-hand experience because we have a loved one that was in the same situation as Jahi."" On Friday, the Alameda County coroner issued a death certificate for Jahi. The certificate, which still needed to be accepted by the health department to become official, listed December 12 as her date of death. Family attorney Christopher Dolan had accused the hospital of being ""hell-bent"" on ending Jahi's life. Jahi's family said last week that the hospital had ""refused to agree to allow us to proceed"" in transferring Jahi to a New York facility. The hospital denied the accusation. ""We have done everything to assist the family of Jahi McMath in their quest to take the deceased body of their daughter to another medical facility,"" hospital spokesman Sam Singer said. CNN's Martin Savidge, Janet DiGiacomo, Greg Botelho and Elizabeth Landau contributed to this report.","A New York facility says it's willing to accept Jahi McMath .

"Lebanon (CNN) -- The UNHCR has announced that we have reached the one millionth Syrian child refugee mark. It is a terrifying statistic if you really digest it and don't just read it as a sanitized account of a tragic war. I've been working with Mercy Corps responding to the Syrian refugee crisis for over a year and have met hundreds of refugees, many of them children. Recently I was at one of our activity centers in Baalbek, Lebanon, where we work with traumatized children. Most of the kids were participating in the organized games and activities, but on the sidelines I saw a little boy sitting alone and staring at nothing. I approached him to see if he was OK, but he didn't look at me. As I came closer I saw his hair had patches of grey at the temples. He was frail and his brows furrowed with worry. He was clearly a boy, but looked very old. He told me his name was Mustafa. When I first asked him to tell me what had happened in Syria he didn't answer me. He just looked away and pretended not to hear. His eyes were dark and unreadable. He seemed to be holding terrible secrets inside. I tried another tack and asked him if he had any brothers or sisters. Slowly Mustafa replied that he had six siblings. After some coaxing, Mustafa opened up and told me a little more. He was 12 years old and lived in Aleppo, Syria, before he came to Lebanon with his family six months ago. In Syria, Mustafa lived in a home on a large plot of land. He spent his days at school with his friends, and then came home and took care of his lambs. He was raising six lambs and caring for them was his favorite part of the day. The family home in Aleppo was near a weapons factory that was under the control of the government forces. For the first two years of the conflict, there wasn't any significant fighting in the area, so the family hadn't made plans to leave. But six months ago, the Free Syrian Army (FSA) began an attack to try to take over the weapons factory. Without any warning, the family found themselves in the middle of a war zone. Mustafa recalled how the bombs started falling near their house and the ground shook under his feet. He remembered his mother screaming and his sisters crying. Finally his parents told the children that they had to leave immediately. Mustafa tried to go out to the field to gather his lambs, but his father forbade him. At this point, Mustafa stopped speaking. He sat silently, holding back a flood of tears. His elder sister, Fatima, joined us and helped to complete his story. The family started to run from the house, toward the village. She pulled Mustafa away from the house as they fled. Every time she let go of his hand, he kept trying to run to get his lambs, even as the bombs were coming closer and closer. The family managed to flee the village and spent two days on a cramped bus to reach Lebanon. They had to cross many checkpoints along the route. Some were run by government troops, others by rebel militias or FSA. At each checkpoint the bus would stop and men with guns would force some of the passengers to get off the bus, and then the bus would go on without them. Fatima didn't remember anyone speaking during the long trip. It was as if everyone was holding their breath, but at night she could hear people crying in the dark. The family arrived in Baalbek with only the clothes they were wearing. They didn't have any friends or relatives in Lebanon and there are no official refugee camps, so they rented part of a house to live in. The family of nine members is crowded into two rooms that serve as their kitchen, living area, bathroom and sleeping quarters. During the winter it was cold and damp and the roof leaked. Now, in the blazing summer heat, the small space is like an oven. Since arriving in Lebanon, Mustafa and his siblings have not attended school. Like most refugee kids, they face language barriers as Syrian children are educated in Arabic, while in Lebanon education is provided primarily in French or English. The school is overcrowded and they don't have money for buses and school supplies. Mustafa spends most of his days helping his parents. He misses his lambs and says he is lonely and hasn't made any friends yet. Mustafa is not an isolated case. Mercy Corps has conducted regular assessments of the psychosocial health of refugee children in Lebanon and found that more than 55% of the youth assessed experience constant fear that something bad will happen and are unable to express their feelings about the conflict. Almost half (46%) feel disconnected from others and have trouble making friends, and more than two-thirds (70%) have trouble sleeping or wet the bed. As the number of refugees forced to flee Syria's civil war continues to grow rapidly, one number stays the same -- more than half of them are children. Every day, thousands more are ripped from their homes and schools, left with painful memories of violence and confusion over what they've lost. Many of them live in constant fear and uncertainty and have lost hope for the future. Mercy Corps has been focused on protecting these youngest refugees since the start of the crisis. We created safe spaces and developed constructive activities where they can heal from trauma, build friendships and develop critical life skills. We are helping meet their families' basic needs, while continually finding new ways to ensure their emotional health and development are not forgotten. The reality is that we don't know when this crisis will end. But when it does, these children will be the ones left to rebuild their lives and their country. Today, was Mustafa's first time attending a Mercy Corps youth program. He started the day out alone on the margins of the activities. But after some counseling and a lot of encouragement from our staff, he joined the other children. I watched him throughout the day and saw him start to relax, make friends and even laugh a few times. And as he was leaving, he promised me he'd be back for the next session. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Cassandra Nelson .","Thousands of Syrians have fled into neighboring Lebanon where they face hardship .

"(CNN) -- OK, go ahead and get the ""Where's my global warming?"" jokes out of your system. With the U.S. Midwest trudging through its second blizzard in a week, we understand. But while it may seem contradictory at first, scientists say bigger blizzards fit the pattern they expect to see from a changing climate. The immediate meteorological cause of the back-to-back snowstorms is a colder-than-normal mass of air that's been hovering over the central United States, combined with an amped-up jet stream that's been dipping south from Canada. That makes conditions ripe for major snowstorms after a warmer-than-normal January for most of the Lower 48. ""Once you get into a pattern that sets up these storms, they can repeat themselves,"" National Weather Service Director Louis Uccellini told CNN. The 21 inches that fell on Wichita, Kansas, in February just broke a monthly snowfall record set in 1913. Amarillo, Texas, saw 19 inches of snow on Monday alone, a total greater than its annual average and smashing a daily record of 12 inches that had stood since 1893. As researchers are quick to point out, weather is different than climate. Weather is what happens today, while climate involves trends in temperature and precipitation over decades. But global average temperatures are up about 1.5 degrees Fahrenheit (0.8 degrees Celsius) since the 1880s, according to NASA, and because warmer air holds more moisture, a cold snap is likely to leave more snow on the ground. ""We have to keep in mind that in any given winter, you're going to have some big snowstorms,"" said Marshall Shepherd, a research meteorologist at the University of Georgia. ""But we're loading the dice or stacking the deck toward more intense blizzards."" While the idea of long-term climate change is a controversial notion politically, it's accepted as fact by most researchers. The warming trend is expected to continue if heat-trapping carbon dioxide -- a byproduct of fossil fuels -- continues to build up in the atmosphere. Sarah Kapnick, who studies snowfall patterns and climate at Princeton University, said the overall trend for snowfall in the western United States is down. Kapnick said her recent research points to more snow at high elevations and the Arctic, but the rest of the country would see less. ""The seasonal cycle is changing, and less of it accumulating,"" Kapnick said. Shepherd said scientists can't attribute any one storm to the effects of climate change, any more than they can point to a single home run as evidence that a baseball player has been using steroids. ""But when we get blizzards, they'll be stronger,"" he said.","A warming climate will mean worse storms but less snow overall, scientists say .

"(CNN) -- Sarah Murnaghan, a 10-year-old Pennsylvania girl with cystic fibrosis whose family fought to have young children prioritized for adult organs, received new lungs Wednesday, her family told CNN. Her surgery took about six hours, and there were no complications resizing or transplanting the adult lungs, according to family spokeswoman Tracy Simon. A statement said the family was elated and that the doctors say Sarah's prognosis is good. ""We expect it will be a long road, but we're not going for easy, we're going for possible. And an organ donor has made this possible for her,"" the family said, calling the family of the deceased person who donated the lungs ""true heroes."" Sarah ""did extremely well"" and was in intensive care after the procedure, Simon said. The parents' push for an organ transplant policy change has thrust the issue of who gets donated organs into the national spotlight. Earlier this week, the Organ Procurement and Transplant Network's executive committee approved a one-year change that makes children younger than 12 eligible for priority on adult lung transplant lists. Sarah received lungs donated by an adult, according to Simon, meaning the lungs needed to be modified. An OPTN news release said Monday that since 2007 only one patient younger than 12 had received adult lungs. Sarah has been in and out of hospitals her entire life, but her condition worsened this year. Her lungs had been deteriorating rapidly over the past few months -- much faster than anyone in her family expected. In May, doctors told her mother, Janet Murnaghan, that Sarah had less than five weeks to live. With just weeks left, Sarah fights the system for life-saving pair of lungs . ""We knew at some point, she would need new lungs,"" her father, Fran Murnaghan, said in May. ""We had hoped it would be much further down the road, but the disease has progressed."" At that time, Sarah had been on the waiting list for new lungs for 18 months. The Murnaghans were under the impression that the transplant would happen any day, since she was the first candidate on the priority list for children in her region. But children's organs rarely become available. In 2012, there were just 10 transplants in Sarah's age group, according to the United Network for Organ Sharing. Comparatively, there were more than 1,700 adult transplants in the same year. Only people 12 years and older qualified for the adult lungs. Doctors previously have said they believe modified adult lungs could save Sarah's life. Last week, the Murnaghans contacted a lawyer, who petitioned Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius to change the rules that keep children under 12 from being prioritized for donated lungs. Sebelius had previously told the family that she didn't have the authority to intervene in a particular case, but she did also call for a policy review. Any change in the policy, though, could take up to two years -- time the Murnaghans didn't have. So in the letter last week they argued the rule was making it all but impossible for Sarah to receive a lung; every adult on the list would have to turn down the lung to let the little girl have it. ""The Under 12 Rule is unfair, arbitrary and capricious, inconsistent with the statute and regulations, and stands in the way of Sarah potentially receiving a set of lungs that she needs to live,"" wrote Stephen G. Harvey, the family's lawyer. Dying girl's plight sparks fight over organ transplants . ""We have never, ever asked that Sarah get special attention or be placed in front of anyone more severe than her,"" her father said at the time. ""So if there... is another adult who is more severe, who has a higher lung allocation score, they will still get their lungs first."" Several factors determine someone's place in line on the adult list: distance from donor to potential recipient, a lung allocation score determined by a patient's diagnosis and test results, and a patient's blood type. Sarah's parents said her score was a 78. It went up to a 91 this week, according to a family spokeswoman. Anything above 60 is considered a high score, according to the OPTN's ranking system, and means a transplant need is particularly urgent. Several lawmakers also got involved urging Sebelius to act. Rep. Patrick Meehan and Sen. Pat Toomey, two Pennsylvania Republicans, co-signed a letter sent to HHS. It read: ""You have the ability and authority to intervene to allow for Sarah and other children under the age of 12 to become eligible for adult organs."" On June 5, the Murnaghan family asked a federal judge to issue a restraining order to block Sebelius from having the agency that oversees transplants apply the policy. The judge granted the injunction and ordered Sebelius to direct the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network to waive the rule in Sarah's case. A letter from Sebelius was sent to the OPTN the following day directing them to comply with the judge's order. OPTN created a second candidate record for Murnaghan that fudged her birth date so the system would treat her as a 12-year-old allowing her to wait on the adult transplant list. Her original record as a 10-year-old also was kept, allowing her to remain first in line for a pediatric lung donation, as well. On the same day he granted the injunction in Sarah's case, Judge Michael Baylson also granted a similar injunction in the case of 11-year-old Javier Acosta, making him eligible for adult lung. Mother who lost one son fights for the other to get new lungs . On Monday, the OPTN took further action, with the group's executive committee approving the change for children under 12. CNN's Jen Christensen, Sarah Hoye and Zain Asher contributed to this report.","NEW: Sarah Murnaghan's family says there were no issues during her lung transplant .

"Editor's note: Malaak Compton-Rock is founder and director of The Angelrock Project, ""an online e-village promoting volunteerism, social responsibility, and sustainable change."" One of her initiatives, ""Journey for Change: Empowering Youth Through Global Service,"" will be seen as part of CNN's ""Black in America 2."" Her first book is being published by Broadway Books in May, 2010, titled, ""If It Takes a Village, Build One: How I Found Meaning Through a Life of Service to Others and 100+ Ways You Can Too."" Malaak Compton-Rock says focusing on problems facing African-Americans is difficult but necessary. (CNN) -- In the words of my mentor and America's foremost child advocate Marian Wright Edelman, founder and president of The Children's Defense Fund, it's time to ""raise a ruckus people, it is time to raise a ruckus!"" CNN's ""Black in America"" raised many critical issues facing African-American people in this great country of ours. It was not pretty, it was not flattering, but it was very, very frank. The show delved into the negative issues that have plagued the African-American community for generations, i.e., crime, education, single parent families, drug abuse and the like. People got mad. People sent many e-mails and letters to Soledad O'Brien and CNN and cried foul. People said ""Black in America"" was not consistent with the lives of many African-American people and was one-sided. Blogs and Web sites popped up all over the place where people ""raised a ruckus"" about the content of the show. I read a lot of these comments. As a matter of fact, I was obsessed with people's views for many weeks after the documentary aired. And the more I read, the more I got angry. The more I read, the more I wanted to ""raise my own ruckus."" But I was frustrated and upset for a very different reason than most. I was almost apoplectic with the amount of criticism for ""Black in America"" without critical, thought provoking commentary about how each person can do their part to make a difference to change the very startling and distressing issues facing most African-American children and adults in America. On a typical day in the lives of black American children: . And on a typical school day for black children in America: . And consider that in America, . [Statistics are from the Children's Defense Fund's Child Research Data.] . This is serious stuff people. And it is the cold-hearted truth. So, it is okay to comment that the documentary did not represent your life. It is okay to comment that it was upsetting to see images of black men in jail, children dropping out of school, and unwed mothers. It is okay because the truth hurts, especially when it is seen by 16 million people. In fact, most of the images shown in ""Black in America"" do not represent my personal life or the lives of my children. But because these issues face my brothers and sisters in my collective African-American family, they concern me, they hurt me, they belong to me, and I will own them. We know that as African-Americans we have come a long way. We know that we are doctors, lawyers, CEOs, philanthropists, politicians, and even the president of the United States of America. And yes, it would do our children a lot of good if these images were portrayed more frequently in the media. But this does not change the very real issues facing African-American people portrayed in ""Black in America."" And frankly, with so many of our people struggling, we can't just celebrate our achievements -- we must make it a priority to work on the most critical and urgent matters in our community. As I always say, ""The blessed and the best of us, must take care of the rest of us."" So why did the criticism make me so mad? Because so much of it was unaccompanied by real ideas, thought-provoking suggestions, plans of action, or inspiring initiatives or solutions. How can you complain if you are unwilling to join the fight? How can you get mad, if you are disinclined to make a difference in someone else's life? And why would you take the time to write an accusatory e-mail to Soledad O'Brien instead of writing a letter to your representative in Congress demanding health care for all children and pregnant women, increased funding for schools, or new initiatives to increase black-owned businesses in black neighborhoods? ""Black in America 2"" will offer many solutions to the ills facing African-American people. I think it will make the naysayers happy. But it will only make me happy if the naysayers ""raise a ruckus"" by joining the fight to better the lives of all black folks. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Malaak Compton-Rock.","Malaak Compton-Rock: Some critical of ""Black in America"" focus on problems .

"(CNN)  -- Venezuela announced Wednesday it is breaking diplomatic relations with Israel over the conflict in Gaza, joining Bolivia, which did the same thing earlier in the day. Bolivian President Evo Morales announces Wednesday that he is severing diplomatic ties with Israel. In the announcement issued by the Venezuelan Foreign Ministry, the government cited ""the gravity of the atrocities against the Palestinian people."" The statement accused the Israelis of having ""ignored, systematically, calls from the United Nations, violating in a repeated and shameless manner the resolutions approved by the overwhelming majority of their members and placing themselves ever more on the margin of international law."" It described ""19 days of continuous bombardment, the assassination of more than 1,000 people and the destruction of the infrastructure of the population of Gaza,"" calling it ""a human catastrophe that is unraveling before the eyes of the entire world."" It further accused Israel of participating in ""state terrorism"" against ""the most weak and innocent human beings: children, women and the aged."" The statement called for Israeli leaders be tried before an international court for crimes against humanity. The move is a ratcheting up of tensions between the two countries that have simmered since January 6, when Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez expelled the Israeli ambassador from Caracas. Venezuela's announcement came hours after Bolivian President Evo Morales announced that Bolivia was breaking diplomatic relations with Israel and urged that Israeli President Shimon Peres and Prime Minister Ehud Olmert be declared war criminals. More than 1,000 Palestinians have been killed and nearly 5,000 wounded in the Israeli military operation, which started December 27, Palestinian officials said Wednesday. Israel said Wednesday that 10 of its soldiers and three civilians have been killed and more than 100 soldiers have been wounded. Israel, which did not immediately respond to the diplomatic moves, has defended its actions in Gaza as a response to years of shelling into its territory from Hamas.

"(CNN) -- The Environmental Protection Agency finalized new federal standards on toxic pollutants and mercury emissions from coal power plants Wednesday, a move being praised by environmentalists but criticized by others, who predict lost jobs and a strain on the nation's power grid. EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson, at an event at the Children's National Medical Center in Washington, announced that for the first time U.S. coal and oil-fired power plant operators must limit their emissions of mercury and other hazardous air pollutants. ""I am glad to be here to mark the finalization of a clean air rule that has been 20 years in the making, and is now ready to start improving our health, protecting our children, and cleaning up our air,"" Jackson said. ""Under the Clean Air Act these standards will require American power plants to put in place proven and widely available pollution control technologies to cut harmful emissions of mercury, arsenic, chromium, nickel and acid gases. In and of itself, this is a great victory for public health, especially for the health of our children."" EPA rules in place since the 1990s target acid rain and smog-forming chemicals emitting from power plants, but not mercury, a neurotoxin known to damage developing fetuses and children. Senate panel examining how chemicals in daily life affect kids' health . Despite federal limits on emissions of mercury from other sources, such as waste incinerators, there have been no limits on coal-fired power plants, which the EPA says constitute the single largest source of mercury emissions. ""These standards rank among the three or four most significant environmental achievements in the EPA's history,"" said John Walke, clean air director of the National Resources Defense Council. ""This rule making represents a generational achievement."" The new regulations are among the most wide-reaching to come from the EPA during Barack Obama's administration. They include separate limits for mercury emissions, acid gasses, and other pollutants from several metals. Opinion: We must stop allowing mercury pollution . Specifically, the EPA will impose numerical emission limits for all existing and future coal plants and propose a range of ""widely available, technical and economically reasonable practices, technologies, and compliance strategies,"" to meet the new demands. According to an EPA analysis, the larger economic benefits of the reduced pollution will more than pay for the short-term clean-up costs. The EPA also predicts more jobs will be created than lost as power plants invest million of dollars in upgrades. It also estimates the new regulations, by reducing people's exposure to these toxins, will prevent 11,000 premature deaths each year and trim health costs. ""EPA estimates that for every dollar spent to reduce pollution from power plants, the American public will see up to $9 in health benefits. The total health and economic benefits of this standard are estimated to be as much as $90 billion annually,"" the agency said in a news release. But the EPA also acknowledges the regulations will result in increased power grid strain: by its estimate, 14.7 gigawatts of power supply will be eliminated from the U.S. power grid when the rules take effect by 2015. That figure -- enough to power well over 10 million U.S. households -- is overly optimistic, according to other industry analyses. Several industry groups and some Republicans also disagree about the economic impact the new regulations will have. Reps. Darrell Issa and Jim Jordan, chairmen of the House Oversight Committee and subcommittee on Regulatory affairs, respectively, sent a letter to the White House earlier this week claiming the ""EPA has failed to perform a proper analysis of the rule's impact on job creation"" and ""consider the rule's impact on grid reliability."" The new rules have also made their way to the Republican presidential campaign trail, with Jon Huntsman recently predicting increased brownouts during the summer and Rick Perry declaring the EPA is a ""job-killing"" agency. And the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, a group traditionally sympathetic to Republicans, has aired ads urging listeners not to ""let the EPA turn out the lights on the American economy."" But the Obama administration has found an ally in New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who argued in a recent op-ed for the Huffington Post that the new standards are gravely needed. ""We can stop this,"" Bloomberg wrote of mercury poisoning. ""We can spare children this tragic injustice and the pain it brings their families. We can spare adults from losing years off their lives. And we can spare taxpayers the enormous health care costs that come with mercury-related-illnesses."" Environmentalists, who earlier his fall were outraged with Obama over his refusal to push for ozone emission standards the EPA supported, are also strongly on board. ""This bold new announcement means less contaminated fish -- and more protections for kids who are at risk of developing learning disabilities and other problems that have been linked to mercury poisoning,"" the Sierra Club said in an e-mail to CNN. ""This is a big public health victory, 20 years in the making. It's one of the most important anti-pollution measures in recent memory."" Mary Anne Hitt, director of the Beyond Coal Campaign, said, ""As a mom, I'm especially excited to know that millions of mothers and babies will now be protected from mercury poisoning. We all teach our kids the simple rule that if you make a mess you should clean it up -- and now polluters will have to follow that same rule."" The new rule requires that the vast majority of mercury contained in coal be captured and prevented from releasing into the air when burned for energy, and would require operators to shut down or upgrade the least efficient power plants. Power plant operators have three years to comply with the new standards, but plant operators may be granted additional time to install the necessary emissions improvement technologies if they are able to demonstrated a valid need. Once airborne, mercury enters bodies of water through precipitation, becomes methylmercury, and accumulates in the food chain. The EPA and the Food and Drug Administration jointly recommend that pregnant women and young children limit their consumption of fish and shellfish to two meals a week because of the methylmercury contamination. CNN's William Hudson contributed to this report.","This is ""a clean air rule that has been 20 years in the making,"" EPA chief Jackson says .

"JERUSALEM (CNN) -- Israeli airstrikes on Gaza continued for a fifth day Wednesday, as the Jewish state's defense minister mulled a truce proposal to allow humanitarian aid into Gaza. A column of Israeli armored vehicles is deployed in a farmer's field Tuesday near the Gaza border. The air assault overnight into Wednesday struck the office of Hamas Prime Minister Ismail Haniya and the Hamas Interior Ministry, among other targets, the Israeli Defense Forces told CNN. The airstrikes followed a mission Tuesday that leveled at least three buildings in a Hamas government compound. The Israeli air force also blasted away at a series of tunnels linking Gaza to Egypt through the Rafah crossing. Meanwhile, Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak was considering the truce proposal -- originally raised by French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner -- and would bring it to Prime Minister Ehud Olmert for consideration, a Defense Ministry official said Tuesday. However, Israeli Defense Forces denied earlier media reports saying it would advise Olmert to adopt a two-day truce. Israeli daily newspaper Haaretz had reported ""the goal of the temporary calm would be to see if Hamas can abide by the truce and cease firing rockets at Israel."" Kouchner called Olmert Tuesday afternoon about the proposal, French Foreign Ministry sources said. France, which holds the rotating European Union presidency until Thursday, had brought together foreign ministers in Paris to address the situation in Gaza and in southern Israel. French President Nicolas Sarkozy's office said Israeli Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni will meet Sarkozy in Paris on Thursday. The Israeli military says it was targeting only Hamas militants, blaming them for rocket fire into southern Israel. Hamas has vowed to defend Gaza in the face of what it calls continued Israeli aggression. Each side blames the other for violating an Egyptian-brokered cease-fire, which formally expired December 19 but had been weakening for months.  Learn more about Gaza's political history Â» . Meanwhile, U.S. President George W. Bush called Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas and Prime Minister Salam Fayyad to discuss a ""sustainable cease-fire,"" White House spokesman Gordon Johndroe told reporters in Crawford, Texas. And the Middle East quartet -- comprised of the United States, the United Nations, Russia and the European Union -- conferred on a conference call about the situation. However, Gaza is controlled by Hamas -- considered a terrorist group by Israel and the United States. Neither will negotiate with Hamas leadership, which seeks an Islamic fundamentalist Palestinian state. A Hamas spokesman said he didn't consider a temporary truce feasible now. ""There is nowhere to talk about just the 48-hours cease-fire,"" Hamas spokesman Osama Hamdan told CNN's ""Situation Room"" on Tuesday. ""We have to talk about an end for this attack, Israeli attacks against the Palestinians and opening all of the borders for the Palestinians to have aid -- either medical aid or another other kind of support -- and then we can talk about the politics."" The United Nations has called for both sides to end the violence, and U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon has roundly condemned both sides: Hamas for the rocket fire and Israel for its ""excessive use of force"" in retaliating. Despite the rumblings on a potential truce, Olmert warned earlier Tuesday the airstrikes were only the beginning of a wider military operation, telling Peres, ""We are currently at the first stage of the operation,"" Israeli government officials said. Of the 375 Palestinians killed, most were Hamas militants, Palestinian medical sources said Tuesday. U.N. officials said at least 60 civilians were among the dead.  Watch why the U.N. is frustrated Â» . Among the dead were two girls, ages 4 and 11, who were killed early Tuesday, as they rode in a donkey-driven cart in Beit Hanoun, sources said. On the Israeli side, three civilians and a soldier have been killed in rocket attacks from Gaza on southern Israel since the campaign began Saturday, military officials and police said. ""They are committed to our destruction,"" Former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said of Hamas. ""They're firing missiles at our civilians. They're hiding behind their civilians. That's a double war crime right there."" Palestinian parliament member Mustafa Barghouti, however, has called the raids a ""war on the Palestinian people"" and said the incursion is politically motivated. The armed wing of Hamas, the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades, said it would continue launching rockets into Israel if ""the aggression continues,"" a masked spokesman said in televised comments. The spokesman said the group had ""so far"" launched 250 rockets into Israel. Israel also has moved tanks to the outskirts of Gaza and called up at least 2,000 army reservists -- sparking fears of a ground incursion into the Palestinian territory. On Tuesday, the Israeli Cabinet approved a Defense request for an additional 2,500 soldiers to be called up if needed.  Watch how Israel is sitting on Gaza's border Â» . The escalating violence in Gaza triggered worldwide demonstrations for both sides.

Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesman Yigal Palmor called allegations that the boat was deliberately rammed ""absurd"" and countered that the volunteer vessel was trying to outmaneuver the Israeli boat. Israel has allowed dozens of trucks carrying relief supplies into Gaza. Also, the Rafah border crossing to Egypt was opened temporarily Tuesday to allow aid workers and medical supplies into Gaza and to transport injured Palestinians to hospitals in Al Arish, about 19 miles from the border, Egyptian journalist Shahira Amin said. Doctors in Al Arish said they were treating 36 wounded Palestinians, at least six of whom were critically injured and being transferred to a hospital in Cairo, Egypt, for treatment.

"Nairobi, Kenya (CNN) -- It's a date etched in the minds of every Kenyan -- September 21, 2013. At the upscale Westgate shopping mall in Nairobi, a youth cooking competition was underway, friends laughed as they sipped coffee and families strolled idly through supermarket aisles. But the relaxing Saturday afternoon was shattered when gunmen descended upon the five-storey facility shooting shoppers indiscriminately. The siege would last four days and the carnage would leave at least 67 people dead. When the terror attack began, Abbas Gullet was one of the first people on the scene. As the head of Kenya Red Cross, he is on the front line of emergency response when disaster strikes in the country -- and this was no exception. ""It's something that we never expected,"" Gullet says. ""We always knew that something may happen, a terror attack -- I think there had been a heightened alert of terror possibility in the country in the last two, three years -- but what I can say is that when it did happen ... we acquitted ourselves very well from an emergency response point of view,"" he adds. ""It happened at about 12:30 and by about 1:15 we were there."" Gullet says that day changed his life forever. Taking lead on the scene, he coordinated teams of paramedics, life support ambulances and a psychosocial unit to offer support to families of those injured or killed during the terror attack. Community support is paramount in emergency situations, and during Westgate Gullet says that he couldn't have asked for a better response. After setting up mobile blood donation clinics, Kenyans banded together to help in whatever way they could. ""They gave blood; they gave money; anything that they could give they were out there to give,"" he says. ""Companies came on board, individuals came on board."" Six months on and the Red Cross secretary general is able to reflect on how the aid group can continue to improve following the Westgate attack. ""The lesson learned is that they need to be better prepared, better coordination with the security forces, with the government,"" says Gullet. ""Since then we've taken a backseat and now are working more closely with hospitals -- as the second-line providers ... we know which hospitals can get what type of person, so today if this were to happen, I know where to take the patients and we're going to do more drills with this hospital. ""But since then as Kenya Red Cross, even our own fast response emergency ambulance services and training, we have moved on another level up from then to now."" A life of dedication . Born in Kenya's north eastern province of Garissa, Gullet lost both his parents when he was just five years old. Raised by his adoptive parents in the coastal city of Mombasa, he says these early events instilled a need to give back, which is part of why he began volunteering with the Red Cross at 14 years old. Over 40 years have passed and the 55-year-old humanitarian is still working as hard as ever. On top of his leading role in Kenya Red Cross, he is also the vice president of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, a position he holds since his election in November last year. ""I would say what ticks me and what makes me continue doing this job is the ability and the opportunity it offers me to be able to make a difference in the lives of ordinary people who are vulnerable,"" he says. ""The ability to bring back hope to them, to give them back their dignity, to have a smile on their face, to have little kids who can have a basic normal life."" During Gullet's tenure in Kenya Red Cross, the disaster response organization has grown from an underfunded society to one which now operates with more than $23 million in assets. He has established response centers and increased the number of available emergency vehicles with specialized equipment for advanced life support -- run out of Nairobi, the organization controls 53 ambulances, with another 75 arriving in June, and also leases emergency vehicles to counties that can't afford to purchase their own. 'Out of the box' ideas . With so many life-saving initiatives to finance, and an increasing number of international, regional and local NGOs fighting also for the same pie, Gullet is often having to get creative when it comes to working out where to get the money his operations require. ""You have to think out of the box to see how you would take this to the next level,"" he says, citing the ""crazy idea"" of Red Cross opening three hotels, including The Boma, a luxurious hotel in Nairobi. ""It's the first in this country, the first in the region, the first in many parts of the world that today the Red Cross owns and runs a five-star hotel,"" he says. ""Any surpluses or profits that the hotel may make, every penny then is brought back into the humanitarian work of the Red Cross."" Despite his many successes, Gullet says there is still work to be done as he continues to strive for improvements in the emergency medicine field and for more locally-generated funding schemes. ""I want to see a day where there is less aid coming from outside and more being generated locally,"" he says. ""Where the African governments would see their national institutions as the first port of call or their preferred choice of partners that can do as good, if not a better, job than what international NGOs would do.""

"Donetsk, Ukraine (CNN) -- It was a confident and forthright address by the new Ukrainian President. With his wife, Maryna, and one of his four children looking on -- as well as U.S. Vice President Joe Biden -- Petro Poroshenko set a new course for Ukraine, one that was unabashedly European. But he also had a warning for anyone who threatened his country: ""Any aggressor at the border of Ukraine must recall the evangelical wisdom: He who comes with the sword will fall from the sword."" In an address to Parliament that lasted nearly 30 minutes, Poroshenko, 48, frequently returned to the theme of peace, security and independence for Ukraine, and vowed to preserve the territorial integrity of the country. That integrity has come under threat in the last two months by what amounts to a rebellion in the eastern regions of Luhansk and Donetsk, one that's led by groups of pro-Russia separatists who have declared ""people's republics"" in both areas. The speech appeared intended both to rally his supporters, with parliamentary elections imminent, and offer an olive branch to opponents. Poroshenko said he was ready to talk to Ukrainians of all viewpoints, and directed remarks in Russian to the 6 million people living in the eastern Donbass region. He promised recognition of minority rights and the Russian language, and support for previously announced decentralization reform, which was one of the earlier demands of protestors in the East. But there would be a limit, he suggested. ""New powers will be granted to local governments, but Ukraine was, is, and will be a unitary state,"" he said. The new President struck a resolute note in dealing with armed groups in the East. He promised amnesty for anyone who puts down their arms but repeated he would not negotiate with anyone who had blood on their hands -- people he described as ""gangsters and killers."" He accused former President Viktor Yanukovych -- who fled Kiev in February -- of financing terrorism in the East, which had been brought to the brink of disaster. Russians who had crossed the border with weapons would be granted safe passage home. The message to Russia and to President Vladimir Putin, whom Poroshenko met on the sidelines of the D-Day commemorations in France on Friday, was twofold. Ukraine could never be reconciled to the annexation of Crimea ""which is and always will be part of Ukraine,"" he said, drawing a standing ovation from parliamentarians. But at the same time, he acknowledged that ""citizens of Ukraine will never enjoy the beauty of peace unless we settle down our relations with Russia."" Poroshenko had said Friday that he hoped negotiations would begin with Russia as early as Sunday to defuse the confrontation in the East. Putin responded that the Ukrainian government should really be talking with its own people. How those relations can be settled while Ukraine steams ahead toward integration with Europe will be Poroshenko's greatest challenge. But of his ultimate vision for the country, he left no doubt. The association agreement and visa-free travel for Ukrainians to the EU were but the first steps ""towards fully-fledged membership of Ukraine in the European Union."" Again, there was prolonged applause from his audience. Whether the European Union is prepared for the cost and political risk involved in accepting Ukraine as its 28th member is very much open to doubt. But as an entrepreneur -- a billionaire who has made his fortune in the candy business -- Poroshenko made clear that he believed only massive investment and a sustained war against corruption could create a ""modern, high-tech and defensible"" Ukraine -- a plan that could only be accelerated by looking to Europe. He also promised a special program of investment aimed at eastern Ukraine, which suffers from high unemployment, a declining coal industry and decrepit manufacturing plants. But the immediate response from the self-declared leaders of the eastern regions was dismissive. A spokesman for Vasily Nikitin, Prime Minister of the Luhansk People's Republic, told CNN that there would only be negotiations with Poroshenko's government when the Ukrainian military left the region, a demand already expressed by his counterpart in Donetsk, Alexander Borodai. Poroshenko later went to St. Sophia Cathedral in Kiev to receive a multi-confessional blessing. At a military ceremony outside the cathedral, he seemed briefly overcome by the occasion -- and perhaps the weight of office -- with tears in his eyes.

"(CNN) -- ""The Voice's"" new winner has put Usher on the scoreboard. On Tuesday night's ""The Voice"" finale, the R&B singer's mentee, Josh Kaufman, was crowned the winner of Season 6. Kaufman's victory came in spite of a technical glitch that made it difficult for fans to show their support of him on iTunes, where his performance from Monday night's show was available for download. ""The Voice"" lets its viewers vote for their favorite singer through phone, e-mail, text and by downloading songs from the show on iTunes. However, as Kaufman warned his fans on Twitter, his cover of Adele's ""Set Fire to the Rain"" from Monday's show wasn't showing up where viewers expected. As a result, ""The Voice"" host Carson Daly said at the start of Tuesday's finale that all of the iTunes downloads from Monday night's show were being tossed out, but the glitch didn't impact the final results. Kaufman was up against Christina Grimmie, the Team Adam Levine singer who came in third, and Jake Worthington from Team Blake Shelton, who placed second. For the first time, neither Adam Levine nor Blake Shelton could boast coaching the season's winner, as Kaufman sealed the championship for Team Usher. (Although, to be fair, Kaufman was on Levine's team first.) Kaufman was at the top of his game during the finale, as he performed a duet with Robin Thicke. The pair of soulful crooners did a rendition of Thicke's new song, ""Get Her Back."" And with this being ""The Voice,"" that was (obviously) far from the only performance. The two-hour season closer was packed with guest stars, and featured sets from Ed Sheeran, Coldplay, Tim McGraw, OneRepublic and Alabama. In the fall, ""The Voice"" will be joined by two new coaches, Pharrell Williams and Gwen Stefani, who will sit alongside mainstays Adam Levine and Blake Shelton.","""The Voice"" crowned Josh Kaufman as the winner of Season 6 .

"Cannes, France (CNN) -- Their stunt-laden movies have put them among the biggest names in Hollywood -- and this was a stunt made to match the world's most famous film festival. A who's-who of action heroes stunned promenaders on the Croisette by arriving in Cannes on tanks! Sly, Arnie, Dolph - and then those other stars whose cause is helped by the addition of a surname -- Jason (Statham), Harrison (Ford), Mel (Gibson), Antonio (Banderas), Wesley (Snipes) and, er Kelsey (Grammar). The muscular military parade came to a halt outside the Carlton Hotel -- the grandest destination on Cannes' main boulevard -- where the assembled action force waved to hundreds of fans when they weren't posing for selfies. Read more: 5 most controversial film festival moments . The CNN team should have been 200 meters further west along the Croisette in the Palais de Festivals watching a screening of Tommy Lee Jones' much anticipated entry for the Palme D'Or, ""The Homesman."" But this was just too good to miss -- a cinematic guilty pleasure. It took two rows of seats to accommodate the cast members, with Sly and Arnie back row, center stage with the newcomers arranged before them, including the only female member of the cast, Ronda Rouse. The quip-fest began and while Arnie, Sly and Mel couldn't resist a few jokey punches and strangleholds, the Expendables crew mostly contented themselves with trading punchlines instead. Talking about the franchise Stallone said ""we finally got it right on the third one -- kinda like marriage."" Laughter accompanied his cheeky shrug. It continued when he was asked what makes the perfect action hero. ""Well you have to be incredibly intelligent, handsome, sexy, good teeth, high IQ, a lot of hair."" But then, like an action hero suddenly remembering a fallen favorite comrade, he became suddenly wistful. ""You know I'm gonna tell you the truth, I think it's the hardest thing in the world to find an action person because its an indefinable thing. What makes an audience like a person? Because it's not about muscles, because a lot of good action guys are not very muscular, they're not particularly good looking. There's something almost intangible and I don't know what it is, but I know it's very rare because there's only been about 15 action heroes -- I mean real serious ones -- in history."" Read more: Kidman's work as Grace Kelly causes stir . Although several of the action heroes he was talking about were there at the press conference, former ""Frasier"" star Kelsey Grammar admitted he wasn't one of them, as he acknowledged when answering a question directed to the newcomers. ""I would like to thank you for characterizing me as one of the younger actors. I'm new to action films and I feel my star is just rising."" Antonio Banderas entered the fray, matching Stallone's earlier wistfulness and raising the stakes with an earnest, poignant account of his early Hollywood career typecast as the baddy with the foreign accent, until 1998's The ""Mask of Zorro"" changed all that and suddenly he was here among the good guys. ""For a Spanish person like me to be invited to be part of this movie, which is kind of a hall of fame for action heroes, means a lot to my community and to me personally."" By the time he'd finished he had transformed into the cute sad-eyed animated cat he personifies in 2011 animation ""Puss in Boots"" and the room was transfixed. But then the ""elephant"" in the room was spotted and cautiously approached. For men of a certain age, what precautions do you take to protect yourselves? Mock indignation ensued. Once again it was Sergeant-Major Stallone who put himself in the line of fire: ""Precautions! I wish. Precautions are not in the budget. Seriously, everyone gets hurt. I've had two back operations, neck fused and both shoulders done. We're talking about hands-on action going all the way back to 'Indiana Jones.' You didn't have CGI then you just did it. And we take pride in actually taking the bumps and bruises."" Mel Gibson concurred: ""We have a battery of physicians like little elves who come in and fix us every night."" ""Yeah we have a whole wing in the hospital"" added Stallone. ""The Mel Gibson wing."" Arnie joined the fun: ""But I think that when you get older things do get easier. When Randy (Couture) picks me up and slams we into a wall it's a padded wall and when Sly was hitting me in the face he was taking it easy a little bit and when Harrison Ford was shooting me with a gun he didn't use live ammo."" ""You're ruining the magic now!"" chipped in Kelsey. The theme continued. When will you know when you're too old to be an action hero? Sly jumped straight in with an alertness which defied his years: ""I think when you wake up in the morning and your a** falls off it's time to go. Let me tell you something -- we are children with arthritis -- we are young forever.""","""The Expendables 3"" cast members arrive on tanks to promote upcoming blockbuster .

"(CNN) -- If you don't like mangoes, look away now. This article includes a ""mango"" word count well in excess of what is normally reasonable. It features mango culinary demonstrations, mango samplings, mango lectures, mango medics, a mango auction and even a mango summit. That's because I attended the International Mango Festival, held in the Fairchild Tropical Botanic Garden in Miami earlier this month. It's an annual event, one that draws enthusiasts, like myself, and also mango ""experts"" who gather to talk, taste and slurp their way around this sweetest, drippiest of fruits. I imagine most are still reading. After all, who doesn't like mangoes? The United States is the world's biggest importer of mangoes, buying in more than 300,000 tons of them in 2010, worth around $280 million, according to the UN's FAO figures. That's not as much bananas -- in the same year the U.S. imported more than 4 million tons of bananas, worth nearly $2 billion. But clearly we have a liking for this red-yellow fruit. My mission, I decided, was to try and discover if there is such a thing as a ""perfect"" mango, and if so, where I could find it. Hundreds of varieties . It's not as absurd a mission as you might think -- there are an estimated one thousand mango varieties grown around the world, the Fairchild Garden has a collection of 600 types, and they're all quite different. ""Surprisingly, only 20 of those are commercially traded,"" says Noris Ledesma, the curator of tropical fruit for Fairchild's Tropical Fruit Program. ""The most common are Tommy Atkins, Ataulfo, Kent and Keitt. With the exception of Ataulfo, which is from Mexico, all other varieties are from Florida."" Mangoes were introduced to the United States in the early 1900s by David Fairchild, the then manager of the Office of Seed and Plant Introduction of the U.S. Department of Agriculture. His global seed explorations brought thousands of seeds, plants and crops into the country, including the mango. Originally from South Asia, the mango moved to Africa, then South America and the Caribbean. Fairchild brought the mango into the U.S. from India. For Dr. Richard Campbell, director of horticulture and senior curator of tropical fruit at the Fairchild, mangoes are ""a special fruit that have everything: aromas, flavors, colors and culture. ""They bring out passion and appeal to the common man and to the most sophisticated."" So where should I start on my perfect mango mission? ""Mangoes from Indonesia do not taste the same as mangoes from India, Hawaii or Mexico. It's just geography,"" says Dr. Campbell. So perhaps I should start close by -- in Florida. Florida produces the majority of mangoes in the United States, and it turns out South Floridians are exceptionally confident with their mango selections. Local favorites . Standing in front of the one dollar line for the mango tasting and flavor evaluations, I ask festival attendee Stacey Griffin what she votes for. Her mango of choice is the Merritt, a complex mango from Florida with layers of flavors. Griffin's second choice goes to the Champagne mango, also known as the Ataulfo, from Mexico, with thick, buttery flesh and a thin pit. For Griffin, mangoes are great in all forms: hot, cold, as smoothies or in a cooked dish. For others, including myself, the choice is too overwhelming to make such an important decision so quickly. I wonder if there are tricks or techniques I should apply to come to a decision quicker. ""The best way to taste mango and to appreciate the complexity of the flavors is early in the morning with an empty stomach,"" says Ledesma. If you want to get really technical, which is exactly what festivals like this seem to thrive on, we can also argue over mango cultivation, pruning, crafting and market demand. The event features a long diary of workshops and displays and other proceedings on all things mango. I learn, for instance, that while India is the world's biggest producer of mangoes by some distance, Mexico is the biggest supplier to the United States, with China, India and Brazil following. That doesn't necessarily mean Mexico has the best mangoes, but the Champagne variety from Mexico is deliciously sweet with an appetizing orange color. Then there's the Keitt -- shining yellow and aromatic. There's the Manila from Philippines -- strong and sour. The Okrong from Thailand is also pleasant, while the Kent variety is rather grassy. Mangoes during the festival sell for the modest price of $1-2 each, but in Japan the price can go much higher. ""The Floridian mango sells for $80 a piece,"" says Ledesma. ""It's given as a gift because its red color is a symbol of luck and abundance."" Mango tastings don't have to involve the fruit in its pure form. Cut, cooked, creamed . Soon I find myself trying mango-based dishes like sticky rice with mango, mango ceviche and mango chutneys offered by local vendors and chefs. It all has a refreshing yet sweet flavor and the savory and spicy combinations intrigue me. Its versatility makes it easy-to-use in salads, dips, chutneys, smoothies and even bread. But even after dozens of tastings, I'm still looking at my notes unable to decide what makes a perfect mango. I seek alternative opinion once again. ""I definitely do not like Manila,"" says seven-year old son. ""It's super sour."" Dr. Campbell says it's almost impossible to decide what the ""best"" mango is. But that doesn't stop him picking one out. ""My favorite is the Edward because I grew up with it, I have it in my backyard,"" says Campbell. ""It is safe and it reminds me of home."" After two days of exploration, numerous tastings and various conversations I finally decide on a favorite: I opt for the Fairchild mango from Panama, named after David Fairchild. It's smooth, creamy and fragrant, its bold sweetness is addictive and I'm intrigued by the color. It's just a shame my choice means excluding so many delicious others.","The International Mango Festival takes places every year in Miami, bringing together mango enthusiasts and experts .

"(CNN) -- Actress Pamela Anderson revealed Friday that she suffered sexual abuse throughout her childhood, starting at age 6 when she was molested by a babysitter. The former ""Baywatch"" star talked about it in remarks at the launch of her animal rights charity -- The Pamela Anderson Foundation -- at the Cannes Film Festival in France. ""I feel now might be the time to reveal some of my most painful memories,"" she said, according to the transcript posted on her online blog. Although she had ""loving parents"" while growing up in British Columbia, Canada, Anderson said she ""did not have an easy childhood.""

"(CNN) -- More than 450,000 Pakistanis have fled their homes for safer areas in the past two weeks as the military has attacked suspected anti-government militant hideouts in northwestern Pakistan, disaster management officials said Tuesday. Many of the displaced civilians have moved from the North Waziristan region, where the military campaign is largely focused, to camps in Pakistan's nearby Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa province, according to the country's army. Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif held a special meeting with government ministers about the exodus on Tuesday, his office said. ""Government is with (the displaced citizens) in these hard times and they will be taken care of,"" Sharif said. Pakistan launched a military operation in North Waziristan and other restive parts of Pakistan's loosely governed tribal areas near the border with Afghanistan on June 15. Defense Minister Khawaja Asif said the offensive is meant to ""finish off"" militants in the area ""once and for all,"" Asif told CNN. The Pakistani Taliban is among the targets. More than 250 insurgents have been killed, according to the army. That includes 47 killed in airstrikes Tuesday, including 27 in North Waziristan and 20 in a different portion of the tribal areas, the army said. The tribal areas are a base for anti-government militants, including those with the Islamist Haqqani movement. Scores of vehicles moved toward North Waziristan to evacuate stranded people. Local tribesmen complained last week that transporters were charging high rates because of a severe shortage of vehicles. About 455,590 people, including 191,897 children, have fled, according to Pakistan's National Disaster Management Authority. Food and cooking oil are being distributed to the civilians at six locations in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, the army said. CNN's Jason Hanna and Ralph Ellis contributed to this report.","Civilians flee North Waziristan as planes strike militants .

"London (CNN) -- When Russian President Vladimir Putin and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping signed a huge gas deal last month, the timing couldn't have been better. It was on the eve of the Putin's St Petersburg Forum, and just weeks after the G7 energy ministers had announced a long-term plan to lessen Europe's troubling dependency on Russian energy. The multi-billion deal had been in the works for a decade, as the two parties negotiated the price. Russia finally agreed to supply natural gas for 30 years starting 2018. The price was not made public, but is estimated at around $456 billion over the 30-year term. The deal is a milestone in Russia's efforts to pivot towards the east. The country has suffered as the crisis in Ukraine deepens and the West implements sanctions. ""The deal will allow [Russia] to continue with an energy-focused business model,"" said Andreas Woergoetter, an OECD economist and the head of Russian economy division. The IMF said that the Russian economy is in recession, and has lowered its growth forecast to just 0.2% for the year. ""There have been consequences on the Russian economy as a result of the geopolitical situation, the uncertainty, and the sanctions that have been decided,"" IMF chief Christine Lagarde told CNN last month. But as its traditional trading ties have weakened, Russia has been building economic relationships elsewhere. In the last five years, trade between Russia and China has grown by a third, from $21 billion in 2008 to nearly $36 billion in 2013. Russians are buying even more from China. In 2013, Russian imports from China added up to $53 billion, largely made up of textiles and other consumer technology such as mobile phones. However, Woergoetter said that any increase of imports from China might be problematic, ""making it even more difficult for Russia to develop a competitive manufacturing sector."" VTB, Russia's second biggest bank, and the Bank of China have also agreed to pay each other in their own domestic currencies to bypass the U.S. dollar. Politically, the two countries have often faced the Western world together within the UN Security Council meetings, such as when they voted against the majority on issues around Syria, Zimbabwe and Myanmar. The deepening relationship was underlined when Xi decided that his first foreign visit as a newly elected Chinese president would be to Moscow.

"(CNN) -- When it comes to cloudy, rainy days, Portland, Oregon, ranks high among U.S. cities. But even with all that moisture, the tap water for hundreds of thousands in and around this Northwest city isn't safe to drink, authorities say. The Portland Water Bureau on Friday urged about 670,000 people in its region to boil water they drink, use to prepare food or make ice, or brush their teeth with after three tests came back positive for E. coli bacteria. ""Boiling water is an inconvenience, but it's the best way to protect until more information on the extent of contamination is known,"" water bureau director David Shaff told reporters. Customers cleared bottled water off supermarket shelves in the hours after the announcement. Rose Festival CityFair -- an annual festival along Portland's waterfront -- was also affected, with event spokesman Rich Jarvis telling CNN affiliate KOIN all vendors were told to dump any food or drink products that somehow used tap water and start over. Jared Brown, from the southwest Portland restaurant Mama Mia Trattoria, told KOIN that his staffers went out to buy 20-gallon jugs of water and bags of ice, while boiling heaping amounts of water for use. What his restaurant is not doing, though, is closing. ""We have reservations this evening,"" Brown said, ""and I'm not letting them down."" Online people have responded to the situation -- in some cases with anger, in many others with humor. One man accused Portland -- ""a city where it rains Ã¢â¦â of the year"" -- of being ""dumb about water"" issues. Another blasted officials for it being three days between the first positive test and when officials decided to tell the public. Others had less serious takes on the predicament, like one who sarcastically screamed on Twitter about the ""#Portland Boil Water Notice Apocalypse 2014! #onlybeerissafe."" One man tweeted, ""I always thought Portland water tasted like poop. Now I know why."" And there was one opportunist who joked (one thinks) he'd sell Two Buck Chuck -- wine that sells for $2 at Trader Joe's -- ""for only $200 a bottle."" In shades of the cult comedy show ""Portlandia,"" one tweet featured a well coiffed boy wearing a crisp denim button-down shirt and a hefty scarf, with his hands in his pockets and his bespectacled eyes staring straight at a camera. It also had this caption: ""This is a Portland hipster child. For just .30/day, you can help provide him with clean drinking water."" Such light jabs aside, the ordeal is proving to be a major inconvenience to many. The first sign of trouble came Wednesday, when a ""routine sample"" taken the previous day tested positive for E. coli. Fresh tests in and around that area came back clean, as did most other tests. But there were also two additional samples that did not. ""Independently, we had all of these things happen. Normally, ... there would be nothing further,"" Shaff said. ""The state, though, has said with these three incidents right after the other, we're going to require you to (act)."" The boil water advisory affects customers of the Portland Water Bureau and water districts for Burlington, the city of Gresham (north of Interstate 84), Lake Grove, Lorna Portland Water, Palatine Hill, Rockwood, Tigard Water Service Area (including Durham, King City and Bull Mountain), Valley View and West Slope. All tap water in those areas should be boiled at a full rolling boil for at least one minute, officials said. Ice or beverages prepared with tap water on or after May 20 should be discarded, officials said. Dr. Paul Lewis, the interim Multnomah County Health Officer, urged people to follow the recommendations. At the same time, he downplayed the threat to the community, saying he didn't ""think there will be any detectable increase in diarrheal illness."" ""We think, overall, this is a very cautious approach that we're taking,"" Lewis said. ""We think that the risk to the public is very low."" This isn't the first time residents of northern Oregon have been asked to take such precautions. The Portland Water Bureau issued a boil water alert to 135,000 area households in 2012 and to 50,000 residents in 2009, both because of E. coli contamination, the Portland Oregonian reported. Both those restrictions were lifted the next day. Will the current advisory be similarly short-lived?

"(CNN) -- As thousands gathered to mark the one-year anniversary of the Boston Marathon bombings, one sight evoked memories of the attack that spurred widespread carnage: suspicious bags near the finish line. Police spotted the bags on Boylston Street -- not far from where two pressure-cooker bombs exploded exactly one year ago Tuesday, killing three people and wounded at least 264 others. Eventually, both bags spotted Tuesday were deemed safe -- but the man carrying one of the bags has been charged with possessing a hoax device. But how are police preparing for this year's marathon, which takes place Monday? Given that the 26.2-mile course runs through eight cities and towns, how can police possibly prevent every suspicious item from slipping through? The anniversary scare . The first clue that something was amiss Tuesday came when a police officer spotted a man with a backpack walking barefoot in the rain down Boylston Street. Police said he became very vocal and started yelling. When asked what was in the backpack, the man told the officer it was a rice cooker, Boston Police Superintendent Randy Halstead said. ""We looked into the backpack, saw that it was what appeared to be a rice cooker, had the individual take the knapsack off, drop it on the street, and he was taken into custody,"" Halstead said. The man, in his early 20s, was identified by prosecutors as Kevin Edson He is also known as Kayvon Edson, officials said. He was arrested and charged with disorderly conduct, disturbing the peace and possession of a hoax device, Halstead said. A bomb squad inspected the bag and deemed it safe. ""In the process of rendering that safe, we noticed a second backpack off to the side,"" Halstead said. ""Nobody claimed ownership of it. At that time, that bag was rendered safe."" Memorial: 'We are America, we own the finish line' Never again . Officials say they have gone to great lengths to make sure nothing like last year's attacks will happen again. In Tuesday's incident, the superintendent said, the ""training kicked in."" ""I have utmost praise for my officer,"" Halstead said. ""That's what he's trained to do, that's what he did, and that's why I'm proud of the guys of this department."" For next week's race, there will be no backpacks or rucksacks on the course itself, said Kurt Schwartz, director of the Massachusetts Emergency Management Agency. ""We didn't receive pushback about the no-rucksack rule,"" Schwartz told CNN last month. He also urged spectators to not carry large coolers or wear costumes or masks. In preparation for this year's marathon, Schwartz said officials have traveled to other states and countries to examine their safety precautions at events. The Boston Athletic Association, which organizers the marathon, said while backpacks and handbags are prohibited for participants, spectators are also encouraged to leave such items at home. Containers with more than 1 liter of liquid, costumes covering the face, and bulky clothes such as vests with pockets won't be allowed. And large flags or signs bigger than 11 inches x 17 inches are also banned from marathon venues. Marathon venues include the start and finish areas, the course, athletes' village and areas where official events are held. Unregistered runners and cyclists intending jump into the race along various points aren't welcome this year, either. ""We are aware that many people want to participate in some way in this year's Boston Marathon as a display of support,"" the BAA said in a statement. ""But we ask that those who are not official participants to refrain from entering the course for the safety of the runners and themselves."" A massive enterprise . This year's marathon will be a massive enterprise. Runners this year will number 36,000 -- up from 27,000 last year. More spectators than ever before will also line the course, according to the athletic association. Keeping that in mind, police will double the number of officers on patrol from last year; 3,500 of them will be among the crowd. They will be aided by 100 additional security cameras, and bomb-sniffing dogs. ""In this world, you never eliminate risk; you never bring it down to zero,"" State Police Col. Timothy Alben told reporters last month. ""But we are working very hard at reducing that risk level and managing it to the best of our collective abilities."" Authorities have not disclosed how much the extra security will cost. All they will offer is that it will be ""much greater"" than last year's. According to Greater Boston Convention & Visitors Bureau, the marathon and related events will bring in an estimated $175.8 million -- the highest-ever Boston Marathon spending impact.

"(CNN) -- As we head into Father's Day, I wanted to reveal a little secret for all the fathers who are doing their best to be great dads and great men. I'm the single mother of a wonderful 9-year-old son. At 46, I've learned more about men from being his mother than I ever learned throughout decades of dating, marriage, divorce, engagement and a broken engagement. It's true. We talk about everything under the sun. The authenticity with which his boyhood exhibits itself constantly keeps me on my toes as often as he keeps me laughing. I thought I knew everything, but by watching my son's perspective on life -- he doesn't hide anything -- I learn more about the male species. In his innocence, he breaks it down better than 100 hours of Oprah can. For instance: . Mommy, why are your legs so hairy? Lesson No. 1: Men like it when women maintain their looks . Whenever I'm burning the candle at both ends, my son reminds me to take care of myself. The first time he noticed my hairy legs was the first time I realized I had let my personal grooming go a little too much. As a fashion expert, my image is usually rather polished and stylish -- in public. However, in private, when I get home the first thing I do is I take off my bra and change into cozy sweats and a T-shirt. If it's winter and my legs are hidden (and I'm not dating anyone), I confess that I often forget to shave. Only my son and I know that I let the hair on my legs grow a liiiiittle tooooo loooong when it's disguised under pants during the winter. When he notices, I know it's time to remind myself to maintain my self-esteem for myself ... and my man. Your legs are so pretty, why don't you wear more dresses? Lesson No. 2: Men love it when women wear dresses . Nothing humbles this fashionista more than when my son asks me to wear dresses more often. I only wear dresses if I'm attending special evening events, so his eyes light up whenever I step out in a dress. I've been blessed with my mother's and grandmother's pretty legs. I rarely used to show them off. Now I do -- because my son reminds me that I should. Sometimes boys do crazy things, Mom . Lesson No. 3: Sometimes men do crazy things . The other day I heard a thumping noise coming from my son's bathroom. He was using the toilet plunger to create what he called ""cool sounds"" on the wall. I had a fit. I was openly annoyed at him for spreading germs on the wall. He was tasked with wiping the wall down with antibacterial wipes. After he finished he said, ""I'm sorry. I know it didn't make any sense. But it was fun! Sometimes boys do crazy things, Mom,"" to which I replied, ""You're right!"" I all could do was hug him and smile. When can I have a play date? Lesson No. 4: Men behave better when they're allowed to play . To all you smothering women out there. ""Stop!"" My son gets ants in his pants on rainy days. He pouts, he gets moody and irritable whenever he can't release his male energy. He thrives whenever he plays with other boys. I would rather be a golf widow than stress over my man's whereabouts. Cars, sports, bars, smartphones, computers, techy stuff and video games. These are just toys for big boys. If your man needs time to hang out with the boys, don't try to stop him. If you encourage him to go outside and play, he'll come home even faster when the streetlights come on. No matter how old they are, men will always be boys at heart. I'm a big boy now Mommy! Lesson No. 5: Men will always be boys, but they want a woman to treat them like a man . My son loves it when I treat him like a big boy, and I let him do big boy stuff with other boys. Even little boys want to be treated like big boys. If I had a dollar for every time I unknowingly emasculated a man (before I learned better from my son), I would be a gazillionaire. I grew up assuming I had to work as hard as a man if I wanted to lead a successful life. I thought that meant I also had to lead men in my personal life. If I had known better, I would have let my man wear the pants while I led him in a dress. Now I wear more dresses than ever ... and I shave my legs, too. Opinion: Son, this is how to be a man . Opinion: My dad gave me life - twice . When is 'Daddy' more than DNA? Join us on Facebook.com/CNNOpinion.","Stephany Greene laughs at the things she has learned about men from her young son .
The lessons span generations -- from taking care of herself to allowing men time to play .

"(CNN) -- Democrats hoping the capture of Ahmed Abu Khatallah will bring some kind of closure to the Benghazi issue are sorely mistaken. In fact, in terms of policy, events surrounding his arrest only highlight the awful legacy of the Libyan venture -- when NATO assisted the rebels and helped remove the dictator from power in 2011. Democracy did not spring up after strongman Moammar Gadhafi was deposed, captured and killed in 2011, but instead a tyranny was replaced with an anarchy. There were an estimated 1,700 armed groups left fighting for control of the country and it became, in the words of some security analysts, ""an arms bazaar."" Moreover, the attacks upon the U.S. mission in Benghazi in 2012, which led to the deaths of four U.S. citizens, raised questions about the Obama administration's competence and challenged the idea that the war on terror had brought greater security to the United States. It is doubtful that seizing Abu Khattalah, accused of masterminding the attack, will allay fears. The Libyan government, such as it is, denies that it gave permission to seize Abu Khattalah and is apparently angry that it happened -- as well it might be. The incident suggests that a) the United States retains some form of military presence in Libya and b) it is quite happy to carry out extraordinary rendition with a minimum of good diplomatic manners. Abu Khattalah was reportedly carried away to face justice in a naval ship. Why? Perhaps partly because it's difficult to find any countries left in the region who might be willing to help with a transfer by air. While Obama flexes America's muscles in Libya, the United States' regional sway is in sharp decline from the heady days of his ""New Beginning"" tour in 2009. The Arab world is in crisis: Bashar al Assad fights on in Syria, Egypt's path to democracy is proving long and tricky, Iraq is descending into sectarian conflict. And the past few days have witnessed the near farcical prospect of the United States and Iran being allied in Iraq. It should be noted that the Iran turnaround has caused some Republicans to make some extraordinary shifts in their own position. Last year, Republican hawk Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina wanted to grant the authority to declare war on Tehran. Now he's talking solemnly of the need to ally with the Iranians as the West once did with Stalin. Opinion: Why U.S. raid in Libya is a sign of hope . As for Hillary Clinton, this will be no quick fix for her problems either. Criticisms of her role in Benghazi while she was secretary of state range from charges that her department engaged in a cover-up to the rather more vague ""lack of leadership;"" there is also the cruel insinuation that she just doesn't care, based upon a misinterpretation of her question ""What difference at this point does it make?"" regarding the killers' motives. Clinton might have hoped that capturing Abu Khattalah would prove that justice can still be done when it comes to Benghazi, but it's difficult to see how it would address the essential question of the adequacy of the administration's response. The reason Benghazi is controversial has less to do with how difficult it has been to catch the perpetrators than with lingering suspicions that the administration did not act quickly enough and tried to deflect criticism by blaming the whole thing on a badly made, anti-Islamic video. Benghazi is raw with emotion, as was obvious when Pat Smith, the mother of one of the victims, demanded answers through Clinton via CNN. Of course, Benghazi is a deeply personal and specific issue for Smith. But for many Americans, particularly those on the right, it goes to the heart of an alleged carelessness in Obama's foreign policy. He could just as easily be criticized for the thousands of drone attacks he has ordered or the invisible red lines that he drew in Syria and then forgot about. But those decisions largely affected foreign citizens, whereas Benghazi is a tale of all-American heroes being let down by the incompetence of their own side. To conservatives, it's nothing less than a case of martyrdom. It could be Obama and Clinton's Iran/Contra: the scandal that comes to define everything morally murky or simply inept about their time in office.","Timothy Stanley: Capture of terror suspect doesn't blunt Benghazi issue for Obama .
He says it highlights the anarchy left behind after U.S. helped unseat strongman Gadhafi .

"ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (CNN) -- At age 19, Yohannes Gebregeorgis borrowed a soft-cover romance novel entitled ""Love Kitten"" that changed his life forever. ""I just wanted to come back to Ethiopia and help children have a future, have hope,"" Yohannes Gebregeorgis says. Born in rural Ethiopia to an illiterate cattle merchant who insisted upon his son's education, Gebregeorgis had seen a few books in school. But it was the experience of having a book of his own that sparked a lifelong commitment. Today, at 56, Gebregeorgis is establishing libraries and literacy programs to connect Ethiopian children with books. ""Most Ethiopian children have only access to textbooks in the classroom,"" says Gebregeorgis. ""Books children read outside of school, those are the spices of education."" It wasn't until he became a children's librarian in the United States that he realized what the children of his native home were missing. Forced to flee Ethiopia to the United States as a political refugee in 1981, Gebregeorgis ultimately put himself through university, obtaining a graduate degree in library science. He relocated to the Bay Area, taking a post at the San Francisco Children's Library in 1985. There, he met ""The Little Engine That Could,"" ""Captain Ahab"" and ""Peter Pan."" He realized the impact children's books could make on a child's sense of wonder and vision. ""Children could imagine everything from books -- connections to other cultures, to other people, to other children, and to the universe at large,"" recalls Gebregeorgis. ""It gives them hope. It gives them pleasure. It gives them everything that they cannot otherwise get in regular textbooks."" But Gebregeorgis found that, among the brilliantly illustrated books in 70 languages, there were none in Amharic, the primary language of Ethiopia, and none representing the places and characters of Ethiopian lore. When the library allocated $1,200 for the purchase of Ethiopian books the following year, Gebregeorgis was unable to find any, because of prohibitive publishing, purchasing and importing costs in his home country. So he wrote one. ""Silly Mammo"" was the first bilingual Amharic-English children's book, and it led Gebregeorgis to establish Ethiopia Reads in 1988. Using proceeds from book sales and grassroots book-a-thons, the nonprofit financed his efforts to bring children's libraries to Ethiopia. In 2002, Gebregeorgis left his job and his home and returned to Ethiopia with 15,000 books donated by the San Francisco Children's Library. With them, he opened the Shola Children's Library on the first floor of his Addis Ababa home.  Watch Gebregeorgis explain how his home became more than just a children's library Â» . Young readers quickly overwhelmed the three-room home, requiring the addition of two large tents to provide shade for hundreds at a time. ""I just wanted to come back to Ethiopia and help children have a future, have hope,"" says Gebregeorgis.  Watch how Gebregeorgis is connecting children with storybooks in Ethiopia Â» . Today, Ethiopia Reads is doing just that. In addition to the original library, the organization established the Awassa Reading Center and Ethiopia's first Donkey Mobile Library. Inspired by a similar concept he'd seen in Zimbabwe, Gebregeorgis customized a donkey-pulled trailer-cart that now makes weekly visits to rural villages around Awassa.  Watch Gebregeorgis and a young reader talk about the four-legged library Â» . Reading storybooks to children who have no access to television or computers, Gebregeorgis believes that literacy and education will emancipate his impoverished land, gripped by HIV/AIDS. Ethiopia Reads recently held its fifth annual Ethiopia Children's Book Week. In 2007, the group offered nearly 94,000 children access to its libraries in Addis Ababa, Awassa and on shady clearings along the Ethiopian countryside. ""With literate children there is no limit as to how much we can do.""","Yohannes Gebregeorgis fled Ethiopia for U.S. as political refugee in 1981 .

"(CNN) -- Oakland is reeling after a gun rampage at a small religious college left seven people dead. Six months ago, eight people died in a shooting in Seal Beach, California. And just over a year ago, an attack targeting Rep. Gabrielle Giffords in Arizona left six dead and 13 injured. Each mass killing provokes a flurry of public shock and a frenzy of media attention -- and often soul-searching about whether they represent a broader descent into gun-fueled violence. But are such attacks on the rise in the United States? Not according to professor James Alan Fox, a criminologist at Northeastern University in Boston who has been studying mass murder for the past three decades. Police search for gun used in Oakland college shooting . Despite the huge media coverage devoted to them, crime statistics show that there is no upward trend in mass killings -- defined as having four victims or more, not counting terrorism -- since the 1970s, he said. Campus shootings, such as the Virginia Tech massacre in 2007, or the cluster of school shootings of the 1990s, including Columbine, often attract more attention than multiple killings in other settings. At Virginia Tech, 23-year-old student Seung-Hui Cho took 32 lives in a solo shooting spree on the Blacksburg campus before killing himself. In 1999 at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colorado, 18-year-old Eric Harris and 17-year-old Dylan Klebold killed 12 of their fellow students and a teacher before taking their own lives in the school library. But despite these high-profile cases, the chances of falling victim to a school or campus shooting are still incredibly slim, Fox said. ""Overall in this country, there is an average of 10 to 20 murders across campuses in any given year,"" he said. ""Compare that to over 1,000 suicides and about 1,500 deaths from binge drinking and drug overdoses."" So while they are sad when they occur, school shootings are ""very few and far between, and very unpredictable,"" Fox said. This suggests that authorities can do greater good by focusing on the prevention of suicide and substance abuse than trying to guard against a campus killer. Looking at a more general picture, while mass murders are more common now than in the 1960s, so is murder generally, Fox said. And although there is no pattern in terms of the way the killings occur, some trends can be drawn about those committing them, Fox said. His research indicates that from 1976 to 2008, there were 852 massacres, involving 4,131 victims and 1,176 perpetrators. The perpetrators tend to be older than those committing murders generally, Fox said, with more than a quarter of those responsible for mass killings aged over 40, his research shows, and the average age of those involved in campus shootings being 36. Meanwhile, 60% of those committing mass murders are white, compared with 47% for murder generally, Fox said, and 94% of the perpetrators are male, compared with 88% for murder generally. Fox suggests that any sense that mass killings are on an upward spiral has more to do with the vagaries of human memory than actual facts. ""Since we tend to remember the ones that happened more recently, rather than the ones before, we often get the sense that three things make an epidemic,"" he said. ""They are rare events, and everything that is rare is difficult to predict."" Kelly McBride, senior faculty for ethics at the Poynter Institute, said that although changes in news media mean mass killings probably get more coverage now than in decades past, she doesn't believe public perception of their frequency has been skewed as a result. That is because of the changing way the audience consumes information, said McBride, who also works on Poynter's Sense-Making Project, which looks at how the public handles information. ""Even though there's more news out there about mass shootings, people are consuming less of it because there's more news out there about everything,"" McBride said. ""I suspect that if you look at the average consumer's diet when there is a mass shooting, it's probably not much different than it was in the old system when there were fewer news organizations covering a mass event."" One reason for the increased coverage of massacres is that the breaking news environment has become so competitive, pushing many outlets to seek the most sensational lines, she said. National and international news providers also muscle in on stories that might previously have been left to local media, she said, and tend to dip into the most dramatic lines. Concern is often raised that such wall-to-wall coverage, especially on cable news channels, may prompt copycat attacks. However, according to McBride, no solid scientific research has demonstrated a contagion effect resulting from media coverage of mass murders. The result must be that authorities struggle to second-guess the unpredictable acts of lone killers, with factors at play ranging from an individual's sense of alienation or personal grievance to mental health care issues or the availability of weapons. But while every senseless massacre leaves a community in shock and tragically cuts short too many lives, the vast majority of Americans will remain untouched apart from the screaming headlines.","There is no upward trend in mass killings since the 1970s, professor James Alan Fox says .
The perpetrators are older and more likely to be white than for murder generally, he says .
Suicides and substance abuse claim far more lives than campus shootings, he says .
Media coverage of mass killings has gone up, but people may not be watching, an analyst says ."
"(CNN) -- They call it the ""coolness factor."" CNN commenters -- clearly energized about the promise of a new, privately developed space shuttle -- are buzzing about winged spacecraft versus capsule-based vehicles like Dragon, which SpaceX used for its historic visit to the space station last month. A commenter called ""gregory"" points out the Skylon space plane project in the UK. The theory behind space planes is they would be able to take off from a runway, rocket into low orbit, and then fly to a landing on a runway. Gregory suggests that space planes are preferable because their engines would be designed to ""breathe air like a jet at lower speeds"" and then ""switch to rocket mode in the high atmosphere."" CNN reported on Skylon last year and one insider estimated development cost to be around $10 billion. NASA's program to fund private spacecraft development offers only a fraction of that amount -- less than $400 million awarded so far. Sierra Nevada's Dream Chaser orbiter, which passed an aerodynamics flight test last month, would launch atop an Atlas V rocket and uses wings to fly back to a runway landing on earth. ""As far as coolness factor -- Skylon wins over Dream Chaser hands down,"" gregory writes. Well, yes, experts say privately developed space planes that take off and land independently from runways would be great. If they existed. But they don't right now. Why not? It costs a lot of money to develop new technology. For Skylon, a crucial engine test still stands in the way of success, according to reports. Then, down the road, suborbital test flights reportedly could happen as soon as 2016, if all goes well. Virgin Galactic's SpaceShipTwo isn't designed to take off from a runway independently, it has to be launched in flight from a mothership aircraft. It is not intended to achieve orbit. Dream Chaser -- which aims to reach the space station -- is expected to have its first autonomous flight test in August or September. It's based on well-known design concepts, which saves money on development costs. Coolness? Aerospace engineers will never choose style over substance. But the sweeping, sleek design of a winged spacecraft like the Dream Chaser does catch the fancy of a lot of aerospace aficionados who still hold a place in their hearts for NASA's retired shuttle program. Let's not forget capsules -- such as the Apollo command module -- which traveled to the moon and back. Yes, they were gumdrop-shaped with less ""coolness factor,"" but they got the job done. More reliable than wings, say supporters, because they're simple and more proven. As one aerospace insider put it: Sometimes the argument about winged versus capsules ""can be almost a religious debate among engineers."" A downside of most capsules: They splashdown in the water, creating water damage, although Russia's Soyuz capsule's system allows it to land safely on solid ground. As CNN commenter ""Dem in Nebraska"" points out, ""Spashdown requires manpower and equipment to lift the capsule out of the ocean, which requires"" lots of expensive logistics and infrastructure. Landing on a runway costs a lot less, Dem suggests. Right now, the SpaceX Dragon is designed to return to Earth by splashing down. But the company has plans to develop the Dragon for on-target propulsive landing on solid ground. All this talk about wings versus capsules goes to a larger point: What's the ultimate goal behind spacecraft like Dream Chaser, Dragon and Boeing's capsule, the CST-100? Is it to build a vehicle that will take astronauts into low orbit? Or does the design goal take a longer view? A longer view may be to develop a spacecraft that can travel to low orbit and travel to the moon -- or beyond. This is what SpaceX is looking to do -- develop spacecraft that can be used for different kinds of missions.","CNN commenter: Space planes have higher ""coolness"" than shuttle .

"(CNN) -- Susie Wolff put the disappointments of Silverstone behind her on Friday with an impressive run in the first free practice session ahead of Sunday's German Grand Prix. The Williams development driver only managed four laps during practice at the British Grand Prix a fortnight ago before engine problems curtailed her involvement. But it was a happier story at Hockenheim as the 31-year-old Scot completed 20 laps finishing a highly respectable 15th. Her best lap time of one minute 20.769 seconds was just 0.227 seconds behind Williams' driver Felipe Massa who finished the session in 11th place. Things had not looked so promising for Wolff earlier in the day as she crawled round her out lap in first gear before returning to the pits. Thankfully, it wasn't long before the mechanical problems were resolved and she was back on track -- even briefly clocking the fastest lap of the session. Wolff has been a development driver for Williams since 2012 and is the first female driver to participate in a F1 race weekend since Italy's Giovanna Amati attempted to qualify for three races during the 1992 season. Lewis Hamilton, speaking ahead of his recent victory at Silverstone, said Wolff's participation at two practice sessions this season was fully deserved. ""She's very, very talented,"" said the Mercedes driver, who raced against her in his junior career in karting and Formula Renault. ""It's really cool to see her in a Formula One car. ""I didn't race against many girls. Susie was one of the very few, if not the only one, I raced against. We shared a podium together a couple of times."" Wolff, who replaced Massa's teammate Valtteri Bottas for Friday's first practice session, finished 1.638 seconds off the pace set by current championship leader Nico Rosberg. Hamilton was fractionally behind (0.065 seconds) his teammate with Ferrari's Fernando Alonso third and Daniel Ricciardo of Red Bull fourth. The Australian's teammate and last year's race winner Sebastian Vettel finished the session in sixth, one place behind McLaren's Jenson Button. Read more: Historic Formula One outing stalls .

"(CNN) -- It's raining hard Thursday in Recife, Brazil, where the U.S. is facing off against Germany in a crucial World Cup game. Yet the pivotal match is being played as scheduled. Main roads are turning into rivers, and the downpour hasn't let up for nearly 12 hours. Access to the stadium is tough -- a trip that is usually easy on a sunny day. The deluge has already made Thursday the rainiest day in Recife in 2014, according to CNN meteorologist Brandon Miller. What's already fallen in six hours' time represents about 25% of the overall monthly average there, Miller said. Follow the live blog . It's likely the rain will continue through the match and will be heavy at times. Cars are barely inching ahead in the flood, said CNN International correspondent Alex Thomas, who is at the World Cup. Thomas noted that had the U.S.-Germany match been postponed or delayed, the Ghana-Portugal game, also Thursday, would have been affected. Final group games are mandated to be played at the exact same time to avoid teams colluding to get through because they know the result of the other game in the group. Meanwhile, there's been drama for Ghana. Two of its star players were thrown out of their squad, accused of physical and verbal attacks within the team's camp. The Ghana Football Association suspended Sulley Muntari and Kevin-Prince Boateng. Muntari, who plays with Italian side AC Milan, was accused of launching an ""unprovoked physical attack"" on Moses Armah, a member of the Ghana Football Association, according to a statement on its website. The association says Boateng launched ""vulgar verbal insults"" at coach Kwesi Appiah during training this week.","Crucial World Cup match goes on despite heavy rain .

"(CNN) -- Benjamin Todd Jealous will step down as president of the NAACP after five years as president of the oldest and largest U.S. civil rights organization, he announced Sunday. ""The NAACP has always been the largest civil rights organization in the streets, and today it is also the largest civil rights organization online, on mobile and at the ballot box too,"" Jealous said in a statement issued Sunday afternoon. ""I am proud to leave the Association financially sound, sustainable, focused, and more powerful than ever."" Jealous, 40, was named president 2008 after working as a community organizer, a newspaper editor and Amnesty International official. He took over from Bruce Gordon, a retired telecommunications executive who clashed with the NAACP's governing board. In announcing his resignation, he said he wanted to spend ""a lot more time with my young family."" Jealous and his wife, Lia, have two children, a 1-year-old son and a 7-year-old daughter. ""My chair asked me when I called her, she said, 'Well, is there someone who's luring you away?' "" Jealous told CNN. ""And I said, 'Yes, there is. His name is Jack, and her name is Morgan.' "" No successor was announced in the statement, in which NAACP board Chairman Roslyn Brock credited Jealous with building a staff able to ""meet the civil rights challenges of the 21st century."" During his tenure, Jealous was a prominent voice against laws the NAACP argued made it harder to vote, such as voter-ID laws passed in numerous states in the past several years. Recently, Jealous condemned as ""outrageous"" the Supreme Court's decision to strike down a key portion of the 1965 Voting Rights Act and lobbied Congress to re-authorize the provisions that the court killed. ""We are on a real fight on voting rights, and it's likely to be a generational battle,"" he told CNN. ""It's being waged against us by people who are fully cognizant that in 2043, this country becomes majority people of color, and they're trying to hold on to the old order for as long as possible."" But he said he was confident that leaders in Congress -- including Democrats like civil rights movement veteran John Lewis and Republicans like James Sensenbrenner, a leading member of the House Judiciary Committee -- support restoring provisions the court struck down. He said the organization's state chapters are strong and that the national organization has doubled its fund-raising take in the past five years. Jealous also advocated easing restrictions on voting by ex-felons; supported efforts to tighten regulations on gun sales after the massacre at a Connecticut elementary school in December; and was particularly outspoken over the February 2012 killing of Trayvon Martin, the Florida teen shot to death by a neighborhood watch volunteer. He called for the resignation of the police chief in Sanford, Florida, accusing him of mishandling the case by failing to arrest the volunteer, George Zimmerman. Prosecutors eventually brought second-degree murder charges Zimmerman, who was acquitted in July. The NAACP has called for the federal government to charge Zimmerman with violating Martin's civil rights after the acquittal, which Jealous said left the impression ""that our young people have to fear the bad guys and the good guys -- the robbers and the cops and the self-appointed community watch volunteer who thinks that they're keeping folks safer.""","NEW: Voting rights fight is a ""generational battle,"" Jealous tells CNN .

"(CNN) -- A Sudanese Christian woman who initially faced a death sentence after refusing to renounce her faith is now at the U.S. Embassy in Khartoum with her family, her husband told CNN on Friday. Mariam Yehya Ibrahim and her husband, American Daniel Wani, were freed from custody Thursday after having been detained two days earlier upon arriving at the airport in the Sudanese capital. Their two children are with them. The family was trying to get to the United States. Ibrahim was accused of two criminal counts, traveling with falsified documents and giving false information, according to her legal team. Tuesday's detention at the airport came a day after Ibrahim's legal team announced the 27-year-old woman had been released from prison following weeks of international controversy over her conviction on apostasy and adultery charges. Her death sentence had been overturned before that release. It's not clear what will come next for Ibrahim, who has been given a U.S. visa. In an interview with the BBC on her way to the embassy, Ibrahim did not offer specifics when asked about her future. ""I will leave it to God,"" she said. ""I didn't even have a chance to see my family when I got out of prison."" U.S. State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf confirmed Ibrahim had been released on bail, saying, ""She and her family are in a safe location, and the government of Sudan has assured us of the family's continued safety."" Harf said that the U.S. Embassy ""remains highly engaged"" in the woman's case. ""We will provide more information as it becomes available consistent with privacy laws,"" she said. Sudanese authorities said Ibrahim was detained because of the documents she submitted. Sudan's National Intelligence and Security Services said that she had South Sudanese travel documents despite not being a citizen of South Sudan, and she was heading to the United States, which is not her native country. ""This was considered illegal by the Sudanese authorities, who have summoned both the U.S. and South Sudanese ambassadors,"" the agency said in a message posted this week on its Facebook page. Religious freedom group 'gravely concerned' Ibrahim's lawyer, Elshareef Ali, said he's glad his client is in ""a safe place."" ""We have strong evidence and strong confirmation from the South Sudan Embassy that these documents were issued by them,"" he said. ""So we believe that the Sudanese authorities will dismiss this case."" According to her attorney, the case began when one of her relatives, a Muslim, filed a criminal complaint saying her family was shocked to find out she had married Wani, a Christian, after she was missing for several years. A Sudanese court considered Ibrahim a Muslim because her father was Muslim, but she said she was a Christian and never practiced Islam. She was charged with adultery, because a Muslim woman's marriage to a Christian man is illegal in Sudan, and with apostasy, accused of illegally renouncing what was alleged to be her original faith. The U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom said Wednesday it was ""gravely concerned"" by Ibrahim's airport detention. ""We are very disturbed by these new developments,"" Chairman Robert P. George said. ""Our chief concern now is for (Mariam) and her family's safety, that they be freed, and for their human rights to be fully respected."" The international community must hold Sudan's government accountable for its constitutional provisions and international commitments to respect freedom of religion by all Sudanese, he said.

"(CNN) -- Just when it looked like the World Cup ""dark horses"" were about to turn up lame, Belgium turned on the power in the final straight to overcome Algeria 2-1 in Belo Horizonte. Trailing to Sofiane Feghouli's first-half penalty, Belgium, tipped by many to reach the later stages of the tournament, hit back in impressive fashion. Marouane Fellaini, derided for much of the season following a nightmare year at Manchester United, headed home an equalizer with 20 minutes remaining after entering the fray as a substitute. And Belgium sealed victory with 10 minutes left when Dries Mertens rounded off a stylish counter-attack to snatch victory. Much has been made of Marc Wilmots' side as the tournament's ""dark horses"" even if this is a nation which has not qualified for the World Cup since 2002. While the talent at Wilmots' disposal cannot be questioned, the side's ability to cope with the pressure on the world's biggest stage remained something of a mystery. For the past year, since Belgium clinched its place at the World Cup, experts have lined up to lavish praise on the country's ""golden generation."" It's generation of players, woven together from the country's immigrant communities, has brought about a new sense of unity within Belgium. Its captain, Vincent Kompany, was born in Brussels to parents of Congolese descent, while Romelu Lukaku, the striker, comes from a similar background. The likes of Fellaini and Nacer Chadli have Moroccan heritage, while Adnan Januzaj, the precociously talented Manchester United player, has Kosovan and Albanian blood. Even so, while Belgium boasts undoubted talent, its players have hardly excelled in European competition this year. While goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois enjoyed a stellar season with Atletico Madrid, winning the Spanish title and finishing second in the Champions League, and Kompany won the Premier League with Manchester City, their compatriots have not been so fortunate. Arsenal's Thomas Vermaelen has spent most of the year as a substitute, while Fellaini has become a figure of fun following a number of disappointing displays at club level. Then there is the Tottenham triumvirate of Jan Vertonghen, Chadli and Mousa Dembele, all of whom have struggled for consistency in the Premier League. Add to that the absence of injured Aston Villa striker Christian Benteke and the fitness doubts surrounding Lukaku, and it's easy to see why the hype soon began to cloud the reality. Nonetheless, Belgium was still expected to deal with an Algeria side which has been widely dismissed by fans and pundits alike. But in Feghouli, Algeria has a player who can mix it with the very best. The 24-year-old, born in France, represented the country of his birth at under-18 and under-21 level but never managed to make the step up to the first team. Now at Spanish club Valencia, Feghouli has begun to attract the attention his talent deserves and this latest performance would have done his reputation no harm at all. His strike, which came from the penalty spot after 24 minutes, might have sealed a historic win for an Algeria side which has never qualified from the group stage in its past three attempts. The goal came following a moment of madness from Vertonghen, who pulled Feghouli to the ground when a calm head was needed. Ranked 22nd in the world, Algeria is Africa's top team according to FIFA -- and while it struggled to pose much of an attacking threat, it looked relatively untroubled by the Belgians. A halftime lead was no less than it deserved following a resilient display in which the defense coped admirably with its opponents. Belgium, blessed with an array of attacking talent, looked stumped in its attempts to open up the Algerian defense. It wasn't until the 66th minute that it created a real opportunity when Divock Origi, on as substitute for the disappointing Lukaku, fired straight at the Algeria goalkeeper. But Belgium did eventually pull level when Fellaini, fresh from entering the action just minutes earlier, headed home Kevin De Bruyne's cross to spark relief. Suddenly, the Red Devils appeared a different proposition and there was a sense of inevitability when Mertens ran clear to fire home the winner with 10 minutes remaining. Fellaini almost added a third when his header was brilliantly tipped over the crossbar by RaÃÂ¯s M'Bohli. Belgium's next game is against Russia on June 22 while Algeria takes on South Korea later that day. Russia 1-1 South Korea . In the group's late game, Russia came from behind to snatch a point against South Korea in Cuiaba. Substitute Alexander Kerzhakov netted a 74th minute equalizer to spare the blushes of his goalkeeper Igor Akinfeev. It was Akinfeev's dreadful error which allowed Lee Keunho's 25-yard effort to somehow squirm out of his hands and over the line. For Fabio Capello, the Russia coach, it must have felt like Groundhog Day. Four years ago, Capello, then in charge of England, watched on in horror as goalkeeper Robert Green allowed an effort to roll underneath his body during a 1-1 draw with the U.S. Fortunately for Russia, Kerzhakov's strike ensured Russia avoided defeat after falling behind with 22 minutes remaining. Both teams pushed forward in search of a winner but were unable to find the goal they so badly craved.

"(CNN) -- Pilots botched the approach and landing of Asiana Airlines Flight 214 in San Francisco nearly a year ago, causing a crash that killed three people and injured 187 others, U.S. safety investigators concluded on Tuesday. But the National Transportation Safety Board also found that crew training and the complexities of a key flight system on the Boeing 777 and how it was described in operating manuals contributed to the July 6 disaster. Investigators, however, primarily faulted the crew of the Korean-based carrier for not fully executing intricate systems of the jetliner packed with more than 300 people before it struck a seawall and careened down Runway 28L trailing sparks and debris. Read the NTSB's accident report summary . In a final report on its probe, the board found that the flight crew mismanaged the plane's descent being carried out without the help of navigational instruments and one of the pilots unintentionally deactivated a system that automatically regulates airspeed. The crew also delayed its decision to abort the landing with the plane flying too slowly to avoid catastrophe, investigators found. The final conclusion was largely in line with early assumptions of investigators facing the most serious commercial airline crash in the United States since a Colgan Air commuter plane fell out of the sky over Buffalo, killing 49 people in February 2009. Crew actions were also singled out in that accident. Aviation experts agree that aircraft automation has made flying safer, and the 777 is one of the most sophisticated jetliners in service. ""But the more complex automation becomes, the more challenging it is to ensure that the pilots adequately understand it,"" Christopher Hart, the acting safety board chairman said in a statement. ""In this instance, the flight crew over-relied on automated systems that they did not fully understand. As a result, they flew the aircraft too low and too slow and collided with the seawall at the end of the runway."" Asiana Airlines fined $500,000 for failing to help families .

"MOSCOW, Russia (CNN)  -- On the eve of a two-day summit with U.S. President Obama, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev says both countries are ""moderately optimistic"" about ""resetting"" their relations. Russian President Dmitry Medvedev spoke to Italian media about conflicting views on U.S. missile defense. In an interview with Italian media RAI and Corriere della Sera, Medvedev said relations ""have begun to revive"" after a period of significant deterioration during the administration of President George W. Bush. The top issue on the agenda for the two leaders, Medvedev said, is working out a new treaty on limiting strategic offensive nuclear weapons to replace the 1991 START I agreement, which expires December 5. The Russian leader stakes out the position Russia has held for some time: that the issue of reducing those weapons is linked to the issue of a missile defense system, and he repeated his opposition to the missile defense shield the United States has proposed to be installed in Poland and the Czech Republic. The Bush administration raised the idea; the Obama administration is reviewing the plan and has not decided whether to proceed. But, significantly, Medvedev said he thinks ""we are fully able to find a reasonable solution"" to the standoff. ""In order to resolve this issue, we do not necessarily have to cancel out all the previous decisions that have been made,"" he said. ""It is enough to show restraint, to show an ability to compromise. And then we can agree on the basic foundations of a new START treaty and agree at the same time on how we will approach missile defense."" The president's remarks are the clearest expression yet of Russia's position on linkage, and they appear to indicate that Russia will not torpedo ongoing negotiations to replace the START I treaty just because Moscow opposes the U.S. missile defense proposal. ""The Russian Federation is not against the development of such a means of defense,"" Medvedev said, ""but we believe that it should not be unilateral nor, in essence, directed against one of the participants in this dialogue, a major nuclear country such as Russia. We believe that the decisions that were taken on this topic have put us in a difficult position."" A missile defense system, he said, ""must refer to global action to protect ourselves from countries which actually pose a threat today. And we are ready for such a dialogue with the United States of America."" U.S. officials insist that the Obama administration wants to work with Russia on missile defense as part of a network of interconnected systems that might include sites in Russia. But final proposals on this are on the back burner as the administration carries out a major review of its defense policy in a ""nuclear posture review,"" scheduled to be completed by this fall. The Russian president, however, rejects the U.S. explanation that the missile defense system is aimed at threats from Iran. ""They are too far apart geographically. I do not understand how people can say that missile defense is linked to the problems of the Middle East,"" he told the Italian media. ""Therefore, it seems to me that all these arguments have been developed simply to justify the decisions taken by the previous administration of the United States.""","Relations have ""begun to revive"" after Bush administration, he says .

"Washington (CNN) -- The Supreme Court could act as early as Friday on pending requests for injunctions in two separate, high-profile cases-- health care reform and same-sex marriage -- that put Justice Sonia Sotomayor in an unusually pivotal role. Religious-affiliated non-profits -- including a Denver-based home for the elderly run by Catholic nuns -- have asked the high court to block enforcement of the requirement in the Affordable Care Act to provide birth control and other reproductive health coverage to their workers. The emergency application was filed Tuesday with Sotomayor, a day before it was set to take effect. She issued a temporary stay, at least until the Obama administration could file a legal response. Supreme Court to take up contraception case . That deadline is Friday at 10 a.m. ET. The Catholic-affiliated groups would have the option of submitting a final rebuttal before the court acts. Obamacare challenge . The appeal again thrusts the politically charged Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, into the national legal spotlight. President Barack Obama's signature domestic initiative, ruled constitutional by the court in 2012, became even more controversial this past fall during its flawed public rollout. The current case spotlights a major sticking point in the law over contraception coverage. The mandate was designed by the administration to give women employed at nonprofit, religious-based organizations -- such as certain hospitals and private faith-based universities -- the ability to receive contraception through separate health policies with no co-pay. A court ruling on this matter could ultimately impact dozens of religious groups and businesses that have mounted legal challenges in recent months. The White House has said the birth control requirement is lawful and ""essential to a woman's health."" The Supreme Court in March will take up a related challenge to the birth control mandate, when it hears arguments over whether some for-profit corporations should be exempt, again on religious liberty grounds. Utah asks Supreme Court to block same-sex marriage . Same-sex marriage . Sotomayor is also taking the lead in a separate appeal involving Utah's law banning gays and lesbians from legal wedlock. A federal judge struck down the statute as unconstitutional on December 20, and the state then asked the high court to block -- at least temporarily -- enforcement of the judge's ruling. She has not yet acted on the state's request, but gave lawyers for a coalition of same-sex couples until Friday at noon ET to file a legal response. Again, the state could submit a final rebuttal, and then the court would decide. An order could come as soon as that afternoon. In the Utah case, U.S. District Judge Robert Shelby said the state's law ""conflicts with the United States Constitution's guarantees of equal protection and due process under the law."" The issue on enforcement is tricky since hundreds of marriage licenses have already been issued by some Utah counties in the nearly two weeks since the decision was announced. Voters there approved a law banning same-sex marriage in 2004. Any action from the high court on the enforcement question would be temporary and not offer the final word on the constitutionality of the state's ban on same-sex marriage. A Denver-based federal appeals court will take up the larger issues on an expedited basis in coming weeks, but in the meantime has allowed those marriages to continue. The state argued Tuesday in its high court appeal that ""as a result of the district court's injunction, numerous same-sex marriages are now occurring every day in Utah. And each one is an affront ... to the interests of the states and its citizens in being able to define marriage through ordinary democratic channels."" Sotomayor on hot seat . Why is Sotomayor the point person for these two hot-button emergency appeals? The simple answer is: location. One of the duties of the individual justices is to handle ""applications"" -- time-sensitive appeals, such as requests for an injunction against some government mandate, or a stay of execution. Each justice is assigned a particular ""circuit"" -- a region of the country or judicial jurisdiction -- to handle these applications. So Sotomayor deals with the 10th Circuit, which includes Colorado, Wyoming, Utah, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Kansas. Her chambers were given separate heads-ups Tuesday by both the state of Utah and by lawyers for a Colorado-based religious-affiliated group that the appeals would be coming, so she was prepared to act. Sotomayor has the discretion of deciding these kinds of appeals herself, or she can ask the entire court to weigh in. There is no specific deadline for her or the court as a whole to act, but they are generally handled relatively quickly. But any decision from the high court at this stage would be limited in nature, dealing only with whether to block enforcement temporarily, until the larger legal and constitutional issues work their way fully through the various federal courts in both the marriage and healthcare cases. The marriage case is Herbert v. Kitchen (13A687). The health care case is Little Sisters of the Poor v. Sebelius (13A691).","Two requests for injuctions puts Sotomayor in unusually pivotal role .

"Washington (CNN) -- It's a scenario we've seen before: a gridlocked Congress pushes off legislative action until the last minute. But this time, leaders couldn't reach a deal before they were scheduled to break for a five-week recess. House Speaker John Boehner and his new leadership team were prepared to pass a bill to fund a response to the crisis at the southern border. But then, Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas called a pizza party, and all bets were off. The bill that Boehner was pushing wasn't even expected to be taken up by the Senate because Democrats oppose a proposed fix to a 2008 law that makes it more difficult to deport children from Central America. Coming in at $659 million -- after Republican leaders twice scaled down their proposal from an initial $1.5 billion -- the bill was a sliver of President Barack Obama's $3.7 billion request. Certainly no one could suggest Republicans were caving in to the White House. But Cruz and his tea party allies in the House were determined to oppose the bill unless GOP leaders tacked on a provision that would reverse an Obama administration policy shielding young migrants and toughen the United States' deportation policy. Less than 24 hours after Cruz pow-wowed with House Republicans over pizza pies, Boehner canceled the vote when he realized he didn't have enough support to pass what was already considered no more than a show vote. Cruz denied playing a lead role in killing the bill, but insiders were quick to give the senator a new title: Speaker Cruz. Oh, and of course, BuzzFeed's D.C. bureau chief piped in. Then there's this zinger from a Republican strategist and CNN political commentator: . Meanwhile, Cruz gave an exclusive interview to the Washington Post's Robert Costa, whose reporting has led the narrative on Cruz's role. That denial hasn't kept House GOP leadership aides and rank-and-file Republicans from pinning the bill's failure on Cruz getting involved in the wrong chamber. It wouldn't be the first time that's happened. But maybe Washington is just delusional, as Cruz suggested Thursday on Twitter. It certainly didn't stop Democrats from seizing on the idea of Cruz, a tea party favorite who has rubbed establishment Republicans the wrong way more than once, leading the Republican caucus. Democrats also criticized Boehner for acting to sue Obama for abusing his executive authority, and then calling on him to act unilaterally to address the border crisis. The Democratic Party's national press secretary jumped at the chance to slam Boehner's leadership failure: . Tea party backers didn't hesitate either, like Laura Ingraham, the influential conservative radio host. Conservative pundit Erick Erickson, who said House Republicans should tack the Cruz-backed provision to a border bill, also weighed in. Right or wrong, these new optics are not threading a positive storyline for congressional Republicans, especially ahead of the 2014 midterms. These questions about the influence of the House GOP leaders couldn't come at a worse time as House Republicans transitioned leadership into new hands. Reps. Kevin McCarthy and Steve Scalise just took over as House majority leader and majority whip, respectively, after Rep. Eric Cantor officially stepped down as the No. 2 House Republican on Thursday. Despite the official change in leadership. Observers floated questions about who actually retained control of the house after the Cantor passed the baton to McCarthy and Scalise, suggesting that a de facto leader was really calling the shots. Cantor's primary loss to an underfunded insurgent challenger stunned the Republican establishment in June. And it appears the tea party -- this time embodied by Cruz and his allies in the House -- is continuing to give GOP leaders a headache. Which makes the timing of Cantor's exit a genius move. .","Cruz is being branded by many as the man who killed the House border bill .

"(CNN) -- Jury selection kicked off Thursday in the federal corruption case of former Detroit Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick and his associates, who are accused of setting up a criminal enterprise in the mayor's office that engaged in racketeering, bribery, fraud and extortion. A panel of 12 jurors, with six alternates, will decide the fate of Kilpatrick; his father, Bernard Kilpatrick; contractor Bobby Ferguson; and Victor Mercado, a former director of Detroit's Water and Sewerage Department. Prosecutors say they were involved in rigging millions of dollars worth of city contracts and extorting city contractors. The jury panel will be whittled from a pool of more than 200 potential candidates. All four men have maintained their innocence. Their attorneys were not immediately available for comment. Ex-Detroit mayor got free trips from pension fund broker, feds say . Prosecutors say the defendants were ""working together to abuse Kilpatrick's public offices, both his position as a state representative as well as his position of mayor of Detroit, to unjustly enrich themselves through a pattern of extortion, bribery and fraud."" At the heart of the scheme was corruption in municipal contracting, mostly centering on the Detroit Water and Sewerage Department, said Barbara McQuade, U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Michigan. Derrick Miller, a former Kilpatrick aide, entered into a plea agreement last year and is expected to testify against his former associates. In September 2008, the ex-mayor pleaded guilty to two felony counts of obstruction of justice stemming from his efforts to cover up an extramarital affair. He also pleaded no contest to charges of assaulting a police officer who was attempting to serve a subpoena on a Kilpatrick friend in that case. 2008: Detroit mayor apologizes to supporters, says he will not resign . 2010: Former Detroit mayor indicted on 19 fraud, tax charges .","The jury panel will be whittled down from a pool of more than 200 candidates .

"OUTSIDE TBILISI, Georgia (CNN)  -- Evidence of the fighting is everywhere in the Georgian city of Gori -- blood on the ground, the smell of smoke in the air, and wrecked cars in the street, according to a CNN crew that drove through the area. A Gori resident outside her apartment block, which was shelled during the conflict. Although Georgian officials and witnesses said Russian jets shelled parts of the city Tuesday morning, a Russian general denied it. ""We were not undertaking any strikes there,"" said Colonel-General Anatoly Nagovitsin, deputy head of the general staff. ""There are no drafted troops in the region, only professionals."" He added that Russian troops entered the conflict last week, because ""it was crucial to weaken the military potential of the aggressor, so that it could never think about repetition of this."" Nagovitsin was referring to the Georgian incursion into the breakaway republic of South Ossetia, which preceded the Russian involvement. The attacks in Gori, about 50 miles northwest of the capital Tbilisi, occurred before Russian President Dmitry Medvedev and French President Nicolas Sarkozy announced a plan late in the day for ending the conflict in Georgia.  Watch a report from Gori as Georgian troops pull out Â» . A Dutch cameraman was killed and a correspondent wounded in a military incident Tuesday morning, the Dutch Foreign Ministry confirmed. Their blood could be seen staining the ground where they fell. By midday, an apartment building was still burning from a Russian rocket that had exploded in the air, sending fiery shrapnel shooting into the structure and the ground, witnesses said. A woman who lives in the building was in tears as she showed a CNN crew pieces of what she said were Russian military munitions. Rockets made craters in Gori's central square, shop windows were blown out from the force of explosions, and many storefronts were pocked by bullet holes, CNN Producer Mike Sefanov said. The fighting has caused many of the residents to flee. Some have gone to Tbilisi and others to Mtskheta, just north of the capital; others have gone to centers for the internally displaced or found shelter elsewhere. Georgians say there is still sporadic fighting happening in South Ossetia, but that is difficult to confirm. The drivers of the few cars that met the CNN crew on the road into South Ossetia gave a mixed report about safety up ahead. One man warned of looting in the South Ossetian village up the road. On the other side of Gori, on the way to Tbilisi, there was evidence that Georgian fighters apparently had failed to fend off attacks. A tank and other Georgian military vehicles were abandoned along the road; some had been blown up.  Interactive map: See how far the Russians have advanced Â» . In the sky overhead, the CNN crew saw helicopters firing flares into the Georgian countryside. It was difficult to tell whose choppers they were -- though the markings didn't look Georgian -- and precisely what they were doing in the air over Georgia.

"(CNN) -- Justice Department inquiries into the dealings of New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie's administration, Sen. Robert Menendez and former Virginia Gov. Robert McDonnell represent the highest profile push in federal public corruption cases since the scandal surrounding lobbyist Jack Abramoff nearly a decade ago. The cases also present the department with a chance to prove it can do big and notoriously difficult public integrity cases after a series of embarrassments, including the prosecution of former Sen. John Edwards, who beat back corruption charges, and its initially successful prosecution of late Alaska Sen. Ted Stevens, which was dismissed because of prosecutor misconduct. New Jersey U.S. Attorney Paul Fishman's preliminary inquiry into allegations of political strong-arm tactics by top Christie appointees so far hasn't established proof of a federal crime, according to two people familiar with the matter. Agents from the FBI's New Jersey field office are continuing to do ""fact-finding"" interviews before determining whether to formally open a full-blown investigation, those people said. A formal investigation can be launched if investigators find enough evidence to warrant additional investigative steps. So far, Fishman's office has sought subpoenas from Christie's reelection campaign and the New Jersey Republican State Committee, which the governor controls. Potential ""can of worms"" For a time, federal authorities were reluctant to get involved in the leading Christie controversy, which erupted from a Democratic-led state assembly investigation of suggestions top Christie appointees abused their authority by allegedly orchestrating traffic gridlock around the George Washington Bridge in Fort Lee last year to politically punish that town's mayor for not endorsing their boss for reelection. Christie denies having any knowledge of the alleged scheme. Some officials didn't readily see a federal crime and were wary of opening what one official called potentially ""a can of worms."" Even before e-mails were released by Democratic state assembly members looking into the bridge scandal, Fishman had received a referral from the inspector general from the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which prompted prosecutors to start a preliminary inquiry. The Port Authority oversees bridges and tunnels linking New York and New Jersey, and is led by appointed officials from both states. After the explosive series of e-mails were released, Fishman decided to make his inquiry public. The ongoing review may yet conclude there isn't a federal crime to pursue, an official familiar with the probe said. In addition to the traffic mess involving access lane closures to the George Washington Bridge last September, federal investigators are also examining whether the Christie administration conditioned Superstorm Sandy recovery aid for Hoboken on support from that city's mayor for a redevelopment project backed by Christie and proposed by a firm with ties to the governor. Fishman's spokeswoman Rebekah Carmichael declined to comment and administration officials deny the assertion. With the highly partisan controversy swirling, Fishman, a Democratic political appointee, must show his office is handling the case impartially. Making it even more complicated, Christie is Fishman's immediate predecessor as U.S. attorney. Other cases . Fishman's office has dealt before with potentially controversial political cases. In 2012 as Menendez ran for reelection, Fishman's office pursued charges against donors to the Senator's campaigns. Menendez called Fishman to complain after a series of leaks appeared in the press that tied him to brothers Benedetto and Joseph Bigica, who were accused of making illegal campaign donations to his campaign. People familiar with the matter said Fishman reported the contacts to the deputy attorney general's office in Washington under protocols that were strengthened following the scandal over the Bush administration's controversial firings of U.S. attorneys. The Justice Department declined to comment. Tricia Enright, a Menendez spokeswoman, said: ""After hearing from several reporters about leaks of information in the Bigica case, Senator Menendez both personally and through his attorney expressed his concern about such leaks to the U.S. Attorney. He in no way expressed any opinions about how the case should be handled. His only concern was that his reputation not be unfairly besmirched by false, anonymous statements. Senator Menendez and his campaign, which was a victim of Bigica's crime, cooperated fully with the U.S. Attorney's investigation every step of the way and were glad that it was prosecuted to the full extent of the law."" Federal prosecutors continue to look into Menendez's involvement with another supporter in Florida. The case ongoing for more than a year involves prosecutors from Miami and from Justice headquarters in Washington looking into whether Menendez improperly tried intervene in an ongoing fraud probe of a Florida doctor with close ties to the Senator. McDonnell, the former Virginia governor, is charged with his wife, Maureen, with public corruption related to gifts the couple received from a friend who heads a nutritional supplements company. McDonnell and his wife say they're innocent in a case that outside observers say could be difficult to prove to a jury. They pleaded not guilty on Friday in Richmond with trial set for July. A renewed focus . The cases come amid a renewed focus on public corruption cases. Attorney General Eric Holder, who began his career in the Justice Department's public integrity section, has made a push to revamp the department's public corruption efforts in the wake of the Stevens debacle. Peter Zeidenberg, a former public integrity prosecutor who helped prosecute Bush-era vice presidential aide Scooter Libby in a CIA leaks case, says ""those cases, particularly the Stevens case, leave a lasting mark."" Given the often political nature of public corruption cases, partisan sniping is always in the background as prosecutors lead their probes. Amid the swirl of public leaks by political opponents cases often look easier than they are, Zeidenberg said. ""Political corruption cases are notoriously hard cases to make. You have to prove corrupt intent, which is a difficult thing to do,"" Zeidenberg said. In the allegations swirling around the Christie administration, based on public information released so far, Zeidenberg says that ""It does not look like a criminal case at all. It looks like political shenanigans, but it doesn't seem at first blush that there's a federal crime there. There is a line eventually that can be crossed between pure political favors and extortion. But there's a large gray area in between.""","Federal probe of Christie administration hasn't found any evidence of a crime so far, sources say .

"(CNN) -- A Japanese lawmaker facing drug charges punishable by death has pleaded not guilty in a Chinese court, Chinese state media reports. Takuma Sakuragi, a 71-year-old member of the Inazawa municipal assembly in Japan's Aichi prefecture, was taken into custody on October 31 when staff at the Guangzhou Baiyun International Airport found more than 3kg of methamphetamine in his suitcase, Xinhua reported. Sakuragi was preparing to board a flight to Shanghai en route back to Japan when he was stopped, the state-run China Daily reported. After his arrest, he denied trafficking drugs, saying he was taking the luggage to Shanghai for a friend, the report continued. Two others -- Aly Yattabare, from Mali, and Guinea citizen Mohamed Soumah -- were arrested in relation to the case and are also standing trial. On Tuesday, Sakuragi pleaded not guilty in the Guangzhou City Intermediate People's Court to charges of transporting illegal drugs. The indictment against him claimed the politician flew from Nagoya to Guangzhou two days before he was detained last year, checking into a hotel with the help of a Nigerian named as Gemadi Hassan, the South China Morning Post reported. He testified that he made the trip after extensive email communication with Hassan, who promised to help Sakuragi recoup hundreds of thousands of dollars of losses in Nigerian investments if he signed a document in Guangzhou, the newspaper reported. The indictment continued that Yattabare gave Sakuragi a suitcase containing women's platform shoes to give to a third party in Japan. Airport security staff subsequently found 28 bags of methamphetamine inside the soles of the shoes and in the suitcase's handle, weighing 3.28kg in total, the South China Morning Post reported. If found guilty, Sakuragi could face the death penalty, which can be applied under Chinese law in cases involving seizures of 50 grams or more of methamphetamine or heroin. An unidentified 50-year-old Japanese drug trafficker was executed on July 26 in the northern Chinese city of Dalian, China Daily reported. While Japan has the death penalty on its books, it is not applicable for drug crimes. Yoshihide Suga, Japan's chief cabinet secretary, told reporters in a press conference in July that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs would provide whatever support was needed by Sakuragi, as it would to all Japanese citizens. But he added that drug crimes were punished severely not only in China but in the wider international community.","Takuma Sakuragi, a 71-year-old lawmaker, is facing drugs charges in China .

"(CNN) -- A year ago, Kyle Thompson was a soft-spoken, 115 pound, football-playing freshman whose tug-of-war with a teacher over 'the hit list,"" a note about kids he wanted to tackle on the field, landed him in handcuffs and ultimately led to his expulsion. He's still soft spoken, but after eight months on house arrest and self-imposed isolation from friends, he's grown. He's taller, heavier. And there's a subtle resolve in his voice now. The Farmington, Michigan, teen said his brush with a zero-tolerance discipline law aged him, made him a man. ""I want to be accepted as a different person, not as a criminal for getting kicked out of school,"" Thompson said. ""I want to have a chance at going to another school to prove myself."" Kyle is exactly the kind of student the Justice and Education departments have concluded is disproportionately impacted by strict, 1990s-era tough-on-crime school discipline policies that call for suspensions, expulsions and even arrests for sometimes minor infractions. He's young. He's male. He's black. School-to-prison pipeline . The two federal agencies are now urging the nation's school districts to dial back harsh punishments that all too often result in African-American and Hispanic kids being funneled into what some members of Congress and student advocates call the ""school-to-prison pipeline."" Research from education and civil rights organizations has consistently shown that students who are repeatedly suspended and expelled from school are more likely to eventually end up behind bars. ""A routine school disciplinary infraction should land a student in the principal's office, not in a police precinct,"" Attorney General Eric Holder said in a recent statement. Harsh realities . Farmington Public Schools said in a statement it is prohibited by federal confidentiality laws from discussing Kyle's case. Superintendent Susan Zurvalec said the issues raised in Kyle's case ""presents an opportunity for citizens to examine zero-tolerance laws in Michigan."" Kyle's mother, Lisa Thompson, said zero tolerance forced her child to learn the harsh realities of life as a young black man in America. ""It changed him,"" his mother said, her voice softening. ""It makes me so sad."" Racial discrimination is at the root of the problem, according to student advocates. The two federal agencies tasked with investigating such matters agree. ""In our investigations, we have found cases where African-American students were disciplined more harshly and more frequently because of their race than similarly situated white students,"" the Justice and Education departments wrote in a recent letter to the nation's school districts. ""In short, racial discrimination in school discipline is a real problem."" In its survey of the nation's public schools, the agencies' civil rights divisions found that, though African-American students who aren't disabled make up 15% of the country's student body, they ""are more than three times as likely as their white peers without disabilities to be expelled or suspended."" African-American students also ""make up 35% of students suspended once, 44% of those suspended more than once, and 36% of students expelled. Further, more than 50% of students who were involved in school-related arrests or referred to law enforcement are Hispanic or African-American,"" the report found. Zero tolerance makes zero sense: Teen punished for helping drunk friend . For the American Civil Liberties Union and other civil rights groups, those figures highlighted the insidious nature of racial discrimination. ""I think there is wider recognition today of the wider consequences of zero-tolerance policies than there was a few years ago and part of that is because of the disproportionate impact on minority students and disabled students because it contributes to the achievement gap,"" said Rodd Monts, field director for the ACLU of Michigan on the impact of harsh penalties on the persistent gap between white and minority academic achievement. Feels like hands are tied . For its part, the Farmington Public School District feels its hands are tied by zero-tolerance policy laws. ""Zero tolerance takes away the flexibility of school districts to individualize the consequences commensurate with the circumstances,"" Superintendent Susan Zurvalec said in a statement. ""It is up to state policy makers to revise these zero- tolerance laws, and until that happens, we will continue to follow our legal mandates as they are."" The Michigan ACLU along with other organizations are working on just that and point out that Farmington officials were aware already in the midst of addressing the disproportionate suspensions of minority kids when Kyle was expelled. ""If this could happen in a district where people actually get it, God help the rest of these kids,"" Monts said. The ACLU is now working with the state's school districts, education organizations and Michigan lawmakers to help change the zero-tolerance law. They hope to help introduce new legislation this spring. Others, such as Frederick Hess, an educational scholar with the conservative American Enterprise Institute, said the Justice and Education departments are so focused on blaming racism that they ignore the fact that perhaps minority kids just have worse behavior in school. Worries expressed . There are two reasons minority kids are disproportionately kicked out of school, Hess said. ""The first is prejudice either overt or intentional ... the second reason is low income or minority kids are misbehaving at higher rates for whatever reason,"" Hess said. ""My experience is that it's probably some mix of the two."" He said rates of punishment ""should be identical across classes and races. But that only makes sense if the behavior is the same across race and classes."" Hess called the federal efforts ""laudable,"" but worries ""the Justice Department has turned a room full of civil rights lawyers on one problem. Lawyers have one lens but I'm concerned they haven't thought about the practical concerns."" Those practical concerns include additional funding to help keep all kids and school staff safe, said Dan Domenech, executive director of the American Association of School Administrators and a former superintendent of Fairfax County, Virginia, public schools. He notes that federal money once available to help schools address discipline was nixed in 2011 though there are competitive grants available. ""It comes back to what is our mission,"" Domenech said. ""Our mission is to provide for the needs of children. The good kids. The bad kids. The indifferent kids. And the expulsion of kids who more than anyone else need to be in school is inappropriate."" Columbine changed everything. The nation's educators and parents were gripped with fear after a 1999 shooting spree by two seniors at Columbine High School in Colorado killed a teacher and 12 students. The suspects committed suicide. And in Columbine's shadow, districts adopted zero-tolerance policies as a way to grapple with an increase in violence on their campuses. Congress had previously passed a federal law in 1995 requiring the expulsion of any student who brought a gun to school. But after Columbine, problem-plagued districts with a history of school violence, and the lawmakers who represented them touted the benefits of zero tolerance as a solution to their woes. As a presidential candidate, then Texas Gov. George W. Bush advocated zero tolerance as a solution to school violence. But the policies, credited by some as helping remove gun and knife wielding young thugs from the classroom also resulted in kindergarteners being suspended for pretending to shoot guns and kids being expelled for using pocketknives for art projects. In Lauderdale County, Mississippi, zero tolerance resulted in African-American students being pulled out of school for such things as talking back. The students, according to a Justice Department investigation, were sent to a juvenile detention facility in Meridian with tiny, dirty cells where they were often maced for not following the rules. In Bryan, Texas, African-American students were issued costly criminal misdemeanor ""tickets"" for talking, cursing or fighting so often that the Education Department launched an investigation into the matter late last year. A packed hearing . During a 2012 Senate Judiciary subcommittee hearing on the ""school-to-prison"" pipeline, worried parents and educators jammed the hearing and an overflow room. ""For many young people, our schools are increasingly a gateway to the criminal justice system,"" said Sen. Richard Durbin, D-Illinois , who chaired the hearing. Zero- tolerance policies ""are not terribly effective and it's certainly not effective in changing children's behavior,"" said Deborah Fowler, deputy director of Texas Appleseed, a group that has worked to break the ""school-to-prison pipeline."" Over the summer, Kyle became so depressed about his expulsion that his mother worried about him. She got him a therapist and a physical trainer to help channel his feelings. Late last year she enrolled him in a private, Christian school. It's a small school with only 40 students and no football team. But no other area school would accept him with his discipline record. ""He still avoids people,"" his mother said adding that he's just not the same kid. ""He doesn't want to be around people from his own school. He's very embarrassed he doesn't want to talk about it."" As a mother, she says she wants to take away the hurt. As a woman raising a young man she said she wants to teach him to always hold his head high and stand firm against injustice. ""I just tell him what you did was not criminal and you're not a criminal.""

"(CNN) -- Beautiful stretches of desert, wispy cumulus clouds, green-chile cheeseburgers and cozy adobe homes. These are the hallmarks of Albuquerque, New Mexico. But now, thanks to the AMC hit series ""Breaking Bad,"" the fictional saga about a high school chemistry teacher turned drug dealer, there are some new, more unusual trademarks. The wildly popular, Emmy-winning television series shot in Albuquerque tells the story of mild-mannered Walter White, played by Bryan Cranston, who is diagnosed with terminal lung cancer early in the show. He turns to producing and selling methamphetamine to secure his family's financial future before he dies. His radical transformation into a ruthless drug baron has spawned a cult-like following (fans are even getting Walter White tattoos). As a result of the show's success, many businesses in Albuquerque are getting creative and prompting visitors to check out spots that were not on the must-see list before 2008 when the series began. How 'Breaking Bad' should end . The final season starts on August 11, so why not pretend to cook up some crystal meth in Albuquerque to mark the occasion? Take a BaD Tour: ABQ Trolley Co. This is not your typical jaunt around town. For starters, the open-air trolleys are covered in stucco to represent the adobe-style buildings of the area. It's called the BaD tour, but, in fact, it's so good that it sells out months in advance. The three-and-a-half-hour tour is run by two locals who clearly love showing people around Walter White and Jesse Pinkman's Albuquerque. Riders on this tour cover nearly 40 miles worth of ""Breaking Bad"" hangouts. Plus, there are flat screens in the trolley playing scenes from the show that coincide with the tour stops. Altogether, guests see up to 20 locations from all five seasons, including the exteriors of Walt's house, Jesse's house, Los Pollos Hermanos, the car wash and Tuco's hideout. Boost your cooking cred: Great Face & Body . If you're looking for something highly unusual to do on your Albuquerque vacation, pretending to cook up crystal meth would be it. During an interactive 60-minute ""cooking"" class at eco-friendly day-spa Great Face & Body you'll learn secrets from the Heisenberg Cookbook. In other words, you'll be whipping up blue sheet candy and blue bath salts, both inspired by White's pure crystal meth. By the end of the class you will be a certified BrBd cookologist, and to prove it, they'll take your mug shot holding your certificate. And better yet, you get to walk away with the evidence, in 8-ounce plastic baggies, of course. After you're finished cooking, try the 40-minute Bathing Bad Body Scrub where your lucky limbs are exfoliated with all-natural ingredients and rehydrated with the cerulean Bathing Bad lotion. Two wheel it: Routes Rentals & Tours . Hop on a signature, yellow-tire three-speed cruiser to explore urban ABQ by bike. Upon arrival Biking Bad tour guests are ""booked"" (given special markings for the tour) and outfitted with bicycles. Then, the first person to answer the initial trivia question correctly draws from a set of five character cards. This determines the tour route. Depending on what tour you are on, you might visit Spooge's house, see where Combo spent his last minutes, visit the DEA building, ride through the neighborhood where Jesse grew up and discover Tuco's headquarters. No worries if you aren't a cycling pro; the tour is intended for riders of all skill levels with mostly level terrain. Eat Mexican: Twisters Burgers and Burritos . On the show it's called Los Pollos Hermanos and serves as home base for meth kingpin Gustavo ""Gus"" Fring. In reality it's Twisters Grill and doesn't actually serve chicken. Instead, grab a root beer float and a plate of Mexican food. Inside you'll find a Los Pollos Hermanos mural, which makes for a recognizable photo op. Choose from burgers and burritos and lots of toppings. The signature item, the Twisters Burrito, comes with chicken, beef, carne adovada or bean and cheese topped with red or green chile, lettuce and tomato. Post chow down, check out the guest book and sign in next to fellow fans visiting from places like France, Germany and Canada. Down a dog: The Dog House Drive In . You know you've arrived at The Dog House when you see a giant neon dachshund sign perched atop a tiny shack off of Route 66. ""Breaking Bad"" fans will recognize it as a place that Jesse Pinkman visits several times on the show. For nearly 60 years, this relic of an eatery has been serving up burgers, tater tots, foot-long chili cheese dogs and Frito pies (Frito Lays chips piled with seasoned ground beef and red chili, cheese, tomatoes and onions.) Be warned, though: Some of the dishes have a kick. Satisfy your sweet tooth: The Candy Lady . Fans love this candy shop located in the historic part of town for a few reasons. First of all, you can purchase a $1 baggie of Breaking Bad Candy. It's so popular, The Candy Lady, Debbie Ball, has sold 30,000 of them to customers around the world in places as far flung as Australia, Sweden, Norway and Germany. In fact, she supplied the show with the prop meth during the first two seasons. While you're at the shop, try on a Heisenberg pork pie hat or snag an ""I'm not Heisenberg"" T-shirt. You'll also find red-and-green chili fudge and X-rated candy (aka chocolate in the shape of unmentionable body parts). Be a rebel: Rebel Donut . Stuff yourself silly at this hometown doughnut shop. Keep with the ""Breaking Bad"" theme by devouring a vanilla cake doughnut with light blue, cotton-candy-flavored icing topped with blue rock candy. Actor Aaron Paul (Jesse Pinkman) custom ordered these awhile back and ever since Blue Sky doughnuts have been flying off the shelves. Other crowd-pleasers include maple bacon bars, green-chili apple fritters and doughnuts topped with Fruity Pebbles. If those don't float your boat, order custom-made doughnuts to your liking. They've done ""Dexter"" doughnuts splattered with red icing, ""Star Wars"" doughnuts and even gender reveal doughnuts for baby showers. Get your brew on: Marble Brewery . Cheers! On August 8 Marble Brewery is introducing two new beers just in time for the final season's premiere. Heisenberg's Dark, a 6.5% ABV Indian Black Ale, represents White's dark side while Walt's White Lie, an India White Ale, represents his family man side. Marble plans to brew about 60 kegs of each style of beer, so there should be plenty to go around. The new themed beers will be on tap through Marble Brewery's distribution network in New Mexico, Arizona and Colorado. Marble Brewery's beers have had cameos on the show several times and members of the cast have visited the brewery, too.","""Breaking Bad"" is shot in Albuquerque, New Mexico .

"(CNN) -- In his speech about Syria Tuesday night, President Obama tried to make a graceful turn on a fast-moving platform. He wanted to explain to a skeptical public why they should support his plan for a limited military attack on Syria in response to, the administration says, the use of chemical weapons by the Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. But his effort was only mildly successful, restating arguments that will be familiar even to those who have not been paying close attention, but also shining a spotlight on the weaknesses of the administration's case. In the 36 hours leading up to his speech, the circumstances that would determine that case took several confusing turns. Suddenly, with Syria's expressed willingness to give up its chemical weapons, a possible diplomatic avenue opened up that might allow the president to claim victory without launching a single missile. But this plan is far from a sure bet and brings problems of its own. This made the president's job of persuasion even more difficult. The credible threat of force likely opened the tentative diplomatic path, which was opened accidentally when Secretary of State John Kerry made an off-hand suggestion, ""a major goof"" in the words of a U.S. official, when he said Assad could avoid U.S. military action if he turned over chemical weapons in a week. ""It can't be done, obviously,"" he added, showing this was not a serious proposal. But the Russians and the Syrians grabbed on to it and suddenly the picture changed dramatically. Obama still had a speech to make. The remarks were scheduled for the eve of a congressional vote on the president's pla, a vote in which Obama's chances did not look good. He asked Congress to hold off on the vote. Still, when he spoke to the people, for most of the address it sounded as if no diplomatic proposal had emerged. He waited until the last part of his remarks to start discussing the possible diplomatic breakthrough, which was a smart move. That entire episode shows the chaos that has reigned as the administration tried to make its case for a military response with strict, self-imposed restrictions. (Obama had to at least appear to have some control of the situation.) He was correct to use this time with the American people instead to try to explain to them (and the rest of the world) why the use of chemical weapons in Syria is a threat to everyone, not just the Syrian people. And he was right to try to bolster support for American intervention. The threat is the only thing that can move a ruthless dictator, because in the end, it is very possible that the plan to dismantle Syrian chemical weapons could fall apart. The task is enormously difficult, dangerous and expensive. Experts say it could take years under the best of circumstances to get rid of what is one of the world's biggest stockpiles. Doing it in the middle of a civil war could, in fact, prove impossible. Obama knows that Russia and Syria, whose paramount goal is the survival of the Assad regime, may be playing for time. Assad has watched Iran game the international community with years of inspections and negotiations without stopping its own program of banned weapons. The president once again appealed to our shared humanity as well as national security and international stability. He urged Americans to look at the wrenching videos showing rows and rows of dead children wrapped in white shrouds, among the more than 1,400 victims of the Aug. 21 gas attack. The arguments are valid, but there's much in the administration's logic that is deeply disturbing. The Syrian conflict is -- we must always remember this -- a moral issue, a matter of profound human suffering. When the president describes the brutality of the Assad regime but then goes on to say the regime can stay in power, its claim to the moral high ground is weak. When Obama speaks of the devastating images of innocent children dying before their helpless parents, and when he says ""When dictators commit atrocities they rely on the world to look the other way,"" it is disingenuous to say we must not look the other way when chemical weapons are used, but killing by conventional means is really not our problem. Like everything else about the Syrian conflict, the Russian proposal is far from the ideal option. It legitimizes Assad's rule, it betrays the hopes of the Syrian opposition and it fails to punish the regime for war crimes. It may leave America with all sides in Syria feeling angry and betrayed, as in Egypt. It strengthens Assad and Putin. That said, if it removes Syria's chemical weapons, it will in fact protect the ""red line"" Obama had set, showing that chemical weapons use triggers international consequences. The president and his secretary of state have been making the case that Assad's capabilities must be degraded, that the more moderate among the rebels need Western support, that failure to help them will make the extremists in the opposition attract more support. That remains true. The diplomatic proposal saved Obama from the immediate threat of failure in Congress and may just keep him out of the conflict. The president's ambivalence about entering has been palpable. He is probably relieved about an opportunity to move in a different direction. So far, Obama's march to non-war in Syria has been marked by failures of persuasion and of process. Whatever happens next, there is no question that the suffering of the Syrian people will not end any time soon and that Syria will continue to be a daunting problem for President Obama. The opinions in this commentary are solely those of Frida Ghitis.","Frida Ghitis: Obama went into speech with Syria situation in new flux; was mildly successful .
She says he saved talk of diplomatic plan till after he described gassing of kids .
She says this because clearing Syria's chemical weapons could fall through, as Assad buys time .

"Austin, Texas (CNN) -- Pixar has nothing on nature when she's hungry. For proof, head to Congress Bridge in Austin, Texas where hundreds of thousands of bats gather between March and October. At sunset they whoosh into the sky like someone spiked a pipeline of black dots. Then, the flapping plume streaks into the city to chow down on thousands of pounds of insects. It's a sight to behold. People watch from the bridge itself or observe from behind the safety of a drink umbrella at one of the few restaurants with a view. Midsummer, when the mama bats start having baby bats, their population swells to a million and a half, making it the biggest urban bat colony in North America. For maximum enjoyment, visitors just need to show up and stand still. To minimize fistfights, avoid mentioning aloud that the bats are Mexican and crossing the border to have babies. Something else descends on Austin in March ... nerds, media types, tastemakers, people who use words like ""tastemakers,"" boys and girls in groups of three and four who carry instruments and occasionally know how to play them. They are all here for the South by Southwest, a black hole of a conference that has absorbed every industry that involves liberal arts graduates with a creative streak. At the center of the chaos stands The Driskill -- a grand dame of a hotel built in 1886, but recently updated and restored. It's a big, handsome place, certainly up to its job of sheltering dignitaries and celebrities who visit Texas' capital city. The Romanesque building has a terrace that overlooks the street and a large rotunda that caps the activity of a bustling lobby bar and the comings and goings from two different restaurants. The Driskill has been the backdrop for all sorts of Texas history -- from the Texas Rangers plotting their ambush of Bonnie and Clyde to Lyndon Johnson taking in the returns of his presidential run, but its most famous visitors are ghosts. Stories abound, but the most common is that of a little girl, allegedly the daughter of a senator, who died in the hotel chasing a ball. It's said that occasionally you can still hear peals of childish laughter and the thump, thump of the toy she lost hold of. But stopping by the Driskill each evening for a nightcap, the only ghosts I saw were those of children past who've grown up to be tipsy and tarted up young adults raring to take on Austin's abundant nightlife. NYC: Cheap thrills with an old flame . The stream of revelers in the Driskill's lobby is a byproduct of the hotel's address on Sixth Street, Austin's honky tonk strip and the basis of its claim to the title ""Live Music Capital of the World."" At its best Sixth is a people-watching paradise with a smorgasbord of music to choose from; at its worst it can feel like Bourbon Street at a keg party. During March in Austin, there is live music and then some. Like a gangster buying turkeys for his neighborhood on Thanksgiving, at SXSW, big business throws concerts and gives away booze to the culture it co-opts and profits from. Austin is a natural place for artists and companies to play patty cake. It's home to four Fortune 500 companies, including Whole Foods -- one of the first companies to let profit motive wear a tie dye to work. And it's home to a gold mine of musicians and artists, including one Willie Nelson, who despite playing outlaw country, flying his freak flag and professing a fondness for funny cigarettes has made a bundle in the mainstream. (The fact that he forgot to pay taxes on part of that bundle, only reinforces the point.) The bohemian ethos that exists in Austin has always accommodated commercial interests. Even the oft- heard local phrase ""Keep Austin Weird"" is not an endorsement of the town's many hippies and hipsters, but instead a slogan of the Austin Independent Business Alliance to promote small businesses. After three days and 21 bands, I found myself in line at a CVS buying earplugs and iodine tablets for my girlfriend back home in Los Angeles. (Note: You can't buy them in Austin and you don't need them anyway. Note to girlfriend: I tried.) A friend suggested we leave the chaos of the conference and go stand in front of trees for a while instead of stacks of amplifiers. So we hit the Barton Creek Green Belt, a seven-mile stretch of land where you can get lost within city limits. On previous trips I'd cooled off in it's various swimming holes, but this time we just strolled along the trails, scrambled around the dry creek bed and admired the limestone cliffs. This is the healthy side of Austin. The part that pushes it to the top of ""livable"" city lists. Lance Armstrong's Austin. And although it was a dry 80 degrees you could feel traces of the oppressive heat that will consume the city in a few months. Seattle has its rain to thank for keeping the city from being completely overrun by transplants; Austin has its summers. When the din in our ears finally stopped and we'd sweated out the past few nights of excess, we decided to ease back into town via Lalas -- a local dive bar where it's Christmas every day. From the looks of the lights, decorations and secondhand smoke, time stopped here sometime in the '70s. The bar is usually tended by Lala herself (it's rumored that the Christmas decorations are permanently on display because she lost her husband during the holidays and left the bar just as it was when he passed), but that day it was her nephew who brought us our drinks. How delightfully decadent to sit in a cool dark bar on a hot sunny day. We left just as the sun began to set. If you go: Austin essentials .","Austin's tremendous temporary bat population puts on a great evening show .

"(CNN) -- When a massive, muscle-bound American football player announced this weekend that he is gay, we watched yet another brick crumble in the monolith of American prejudice. To some, Michael Sam's words might have come as a shock, but most Americans know the country is in the midst of a fundamental social shift, one that conjures images of a different place. Where? Well, if you traveled from the United States to the Netherlands a few years ago, what you saw -- and smelled -- in the streets of ultra-liberal Amsterdam probably shocked you. Young people smoking joints in an open-air cafÃÂ©, gay couples holding hands on the streets and people of all ages not batting an eye about any of it gave U.S. visitors a novel and exotic experience. Back then, the United States and the Netherlands stood on opposite sides of the front line of the social wars. Not anymore. It's not because the Netherlands has changed. It is the United States, the American people, who have changed. The transformation in U.S. public opinion, increasingly reflected in legislation, has narrowed what was an enormous gap between the two countries. Change is coming at such a fast, accelerating rate that one wonders, is America turning into the Netherlands? I will save you the trouble of answering. No, but there is no denying there is a visible convergence on key issues. As a frequent visitor to the Netherlands for many years, I can tell you that the disbelieving questions I used to face about America's puritanism have become much less frequent. (Others, mostly about guns in America, have not abated.) In the summer of 1998, then-U.S. drug czar Barry McCaffrey triggered an unseemly diplomatic skirmish during a fact-finding visit to the Dutch capital. The four-star general, charged with leading America's war on drugs, tensed up as he saw the smoke wafting out of perfectly legal pot-selling cafes in Amsterdam. He surveyed the permissive drug environment and publicly judged Dutch drug policy an ""unmitigated disaster."" Dutch government officials responded with a barrage of statistics to prove the visitor wrong, and coffee shop customers declared McCaffrey had no idea what he was talking about. The general may have been too focused on the drug situation to notice what was happening on the same-sex marriage front in the Netherlands. Perhaps he would have found that also disastrous. The parliament had just approved an innovative concept of ""registered partnerships,"" allowing couples, gay and straight, to be treated more or less the same as their legally married counterparts. In the United State then, during the 1990s, the weapon of choice in the Republican arsenal was ""family values."" The approval of same-sex marriage was about as likely in the United States as, say, Russian President Vladimir Putin officiating a gay wedding in Sochi today. The 1992 and 1996 Republican conventions, which I attended as part of the CNN team, were choreographed carnivals of anti-gay invective. It wasn't just Republicans. By substantial majorities, Americans opposed gay rights and, incidentally, strongly supported drug laws outlawing marijuana use. In a CNN poll in 1998, a majority said they believed gay people can change their sexual orientation if they chose to do so. But at the same time, American views were beginning to budge. Just as President Barack Obama's public embrace of same-sex marriage gave a boost to popular support, Bill Clinton sensed an increase in acceptance and tried to propel change with an effort to end the ban on gays in the military. The reaction would have been laughable had it not been so outrageous. Sam Nunn, then the Democratic chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, toured a submarine, expertly examining the bunks where sailors slept in close quarters. Obviously, the tour indicated, gay men would find the temptation of nearby sailors simply irresistible. Clinton changed course, approved the military's ""don't ask, don't tell"" policy and signed the Defense of Marriage Act, both of which caused enormous injustices, both of which stayed in place until recently. In 2001, George W. Bush took office, invigorating Republicans. That same year, the Netherlands became the world's first country to legalize same-sex marriage. The day the bill became law, Amsterdam's mayor became a registrar and personally officiated the country's first such wedding. A Pew Research Center poll clocked support for same-sex marriage among Americans then at just 35%. Despite the head winds, the battle for equal rights has not stopped, not in the United States, not in other corners of the world. As the German philosopher Georg Hegel explained more than 200 years ago, history itself is the progress of the consciousness of freedom. It can be slowed. It can be delayed. But it cannot be stopped. Today, America looks like a different country. In fact, in many respects it looks very much like the Netherlands. Today, a majority of Americans support same-sex marriage, which is legal in 17 states and the District of Columbia. And that majority is sure to continue growing, because the numbers are overwhelming among young people. Even the legalization of marijuana, which is picking up legal support around the country, enjoys majority support. Does that mean America is becoming more liberal? Not really. In the Netherlands, the driving philosophy is one of tolerance and compromise. In the United States, the shift reflects a closer alignment with the country's historic embrace of freedom from the government. The ""family values"" efforts to legislate morality run counter to that libertarian notion of freedom. Liberals have always been more comfortable with the differences between people. And conservatives are increasingly redefining their stance on a number of social issues, concluding that different people can live different lives. The government should not interfere. There are many other factors, of course. Activists have worked persistently to educate the public. And the entertainment industry has played an important role. And the changes in America are echoes of a global trend. Secular, affluent countries tend to be more accepting of different lifestyle choices. Homosexuality is gaining acceptance in the West, while it is overwhelmingly condemned in Muslim countries, and in sub-Saharan Africa. The Western world's attitude toward drugs is changing. ""Hard"" drugs and addiction are seen more as a disease than a moral failing. Marijuana, once demonized, is increasingly viewed as less harmful than alcohol. There are many areas in which progressive Western nations, such as the Netherlands, are still sharply different from the United States. Differences over gun policy will likely persist, while views over contentious topics such as the right to die are likely to converge. For America, the driving force behind the transformation is found in a changing definition of the meaning of freedom. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Frida Ghitis.","Frida Ghitis: The Netherlands once seemed permissive to U.S. on pot, same-sex marriage .

"(CNN) -- Which politician do you hate? Do you think President Barack Obama wants to destroy America? Or do you believe former President George W. Bush is the one who sent the country into the abyss? What about Ted Cruz, Nancy Pelosi or John Boehner -- which one of them do you think is the devil incarnate? Americans, disgusted by the failures in Washington, have increasingly resorted to personalizing the blame, drawing imaginary bull's-eyes and throwing figurative darts at the faces of the politicians whose views they disagree with, all the while fantasizing about throwing the people they despise out of political office. Unfortunately, the problem goes much deeper than a few individuals, however incompetent or despicable: Throw out the ones you hate, and you'll get new ones to blame, because the problems will not disappear without repairing the flaws in the system that brought the country to this embarrassing and self-destructive place. The people are rightly fed up. In the middle of the just-ended federal shutdown, polls showed most Americans blamed the mess on Republicans, but approval for the entire Congress, which has Democrats as well as Republicans, sank to an incredible 5%. The prevailing sentiment was revulsion. The question, however, is not how awful the politicians are. The question is why American voters ended up with representatives whose performance they find so thoroughly reprehensible. The answer to that question provides a path to solving the problem. The problem is not just that the nation has divided and moved into partisan echo chambers, where everyone listens only to the people with whom they agree. Each side listens to its own favorite commentators on television and radio; each follows like-minded thinkers on Twitter and Facebook. In that system, the most vitriolic speech is the most highly rewarded. Moderate Americans have less tantalizing things to say. If you think the other side is driven only by selfish motives or by nefarious goals, you will find a willing, enthusiastic and fast-growing audience. But if you believe that the differences stem from different life experiences and honest philosophical disagreements and if you believe that Republicans and Democrats want what is best for the country but have distinct ideas about what that means or how to achieve it, your views will get little traction in this emotionally charged environment. The irony is that those moderate views represent America most faithfully. A recent poll by NBC and Esquire magazine concluded that most Americans are social and political centrists, in sharp contrast to the clashes of extremes that we see in the media, on the Internet and in Congress. The poll showed the majority supports same-sex marriage, legal marijuana, paid maternity leave, child care subsidies to help new mothers get back to work, a higher minimum wage and paid sick leave. But a majority also supports the death penalty, offshore drilling and the end of affirmative action in hiring and education. This is not the picture of an extremist country. It's the picture of a nation trying to come to grips with difficult questions. That, of course, is not how Congress looks. There, everyone seems absolutely certain on every issue, even if certainty is something that should elude us all frequently if we are honest about our human limitations. So how did we end up with a Congress that looks so different from America? One of the main reasons is voter apathy. Most voters are paying attention right now, horrified by the spectacle put on by their representatives. But when the time comes for choosing those representatives, particularly during midterms and local elections, they become distracted, leaving the job to the zealots, those people who care most passionately about politics and are most closely affiliated with activist political groups. As a result, whichever side is most energized -- often the one feeling most aggrieved -- manages to mobilize for the low-turnout elections. In 2010, the flames of hatred against Barack Obama burned hot, just as they had once burned against George W. Bush on the other side of the political spectrum. The 2010 election not only took more right-wing Republicans to Washington, it also gave them historic gains in state legislatures. Local control of legislatures has allowed the parties to sharpen their gerrymandering pens -- drawing safe congressional districts that all but guarantee re-election. Americans may want to fire all of Congress, but they don't want to fire their own representative. That means there is little incentive to compromise. Inflexible politicians are rewarded by voters, and the country suffers. Not only is the government not providing the best possible solutions for America's problems, it is, in fact, creating new problems, causing unemployment. Just as the U.S. economy managed to pull out of recession, the politicians put their shoulder to the wheel and pushed in the wrong direction. The shutdown that just ended and the flirtation with the potential disaster of running against the debt ceiling are the latest chapter in a long-running political soap opera. It might be entertaining if it weren't so damaging. According to one study, the fiscal standoffs since 2009 have lowered growth by 0.3% of GDP each year, amounting by some calculations, to $700 billion in lost GDP. Among other costs, that means 900,000 jobs lost. The shutdown has cost America in global leadership, a loss it won't soon recover. America has been weakened. Its rivals are gloating. And now that the two sides have finally reached a deal to reopen the government, the agreement is good for just three months. That means more uncertainty, more government-made pushback against recovery and job creation, more talented federal employees deciding they've had enough of working for an employer that suddenly tells them ""don't come to work tomorrow, even if you want to."" Centrists, the majority of the country, would help America simply by speaking out as forcefully for moderate positions as the zealots do, by encouraging people to listen to different points of views, by pushing for a return to more mixed congressional districts and by making sure to vote in all elections. Instead of wasting energy raging against individual politicians, it would be more productive to fight against apathy and against demonization. Hating individual politicians misses the point. Fight instead to fix the system that is broken.

"Tel Aviv (CNN) -- Four-year-old Yosef lies in a hospital bed with curiosity gleaming in his eyes as he listens to a family friend tell him the age-old story of Jonah and the whale. The young boy is surprisingly bright-eyed after the traumatic ordeal he's endured as a result of the latest outbreak of warfare between Gaza and Israel. He and his parents were staying in an apartment in Kiryat Malachi in southern Israel when a rocket sailed over from Gaza and slammed into it, leaving a gaping hole in the building. The blast sheered off several of Yosef's tiny fingers, badly wounded his father, and killed his mother, Mina Scharf, one of the first to die on the Israeli side of the border. Hamas leaders in Egypt for cease-fire talks involving Israel . Yosef learned about his mother from his father, Shmuel, who is recovering in the same hospital. ""He was saying, 'My mother is not here; she's with God.' He knows it will be a hard time,"" his grandmother, Chaya Sarah Scharf, said. Hard is putting it mildly. Doctors at the Sheba Medical Center at Tel Hashomer hospital re-attached four of his fingers, but in the end they had to re-amputate two of them. ""He lives in the South and there are rockets all the time in that area. Hamas doesn't even think about where the rockets are going,"" his grandmother said. While nurses attended to Yosef in Room 12, one room away nurses were attending to on another child with nearly identical wounds from the most recent chapter of this conflict. What sets them apart is that the second child is from Gaza. Eight-year-old Bisan al-Aghram lost three fingers when the war came to her home. ""I heard the sound of a missile that hit. I didn't even have time to ask what happened and then the second one (hit),"" said her mother, Soad al-Aghram. When the dust cleared, she could see the bones of her childÃÂ¹s fingers in small pieces on the floor. The girl was taken to Gaza's al-Shifa hospital, but it was too crowded and couldn't give her the best care. So the family asked Israel for permission to cross the border. Initially, her mother was terrified at the prospect of people considered an enemy in her country handling her wounded daughter. ""ItÃÂ¹s a strange situation and it's my first time entering Israel. I was afraid, but they treat me and my daughter in a very nice way, and I understand that medicine has nothing to do with politics,"" al-Aghram said. That's the philosophy the hospital tries to adhere to -- no matter what. After Israel-Gaza: Who won, who lost? ""All the tension is blocked outside of the hospital here. There is an island of sanity in the stormy water of the Middle East. Here we actually treat people. We don't actually look from where they are, what they do and what they did before coming here, and what they are going to do after leaving us,"" said Zeev Rotstein, CEO of Sheba Medical Center. The same doctor is treating the two children of conflict who both lost fingers from rocket blasts. ""It will affect her life from now on, and his life from now on, in choice of profession ... or in choice of future partners for life, everything. And this kind of injury, although it seems minor, it's affecting the person for life,"" hand surgeon Dr. Batia Yaffe said. Yaffe has worked in this Tel Aviv hospital nearly her entire career. She has treated everyone from soldiers to suicide bombers and the civilians in between. ""I come to think about what is it about this piece of land that everybody is fighting about it all the time. This is what comes to my mind: whether this is our lot for eternity from now on. Always have injuries on both sides, always fighting -- what's the point?"" she asks. If there is a point, it is lost on a 4-year-old boy and an 8-year-old girl from either side of the Israel-Gaza border who just want to be children, but whose innocence has been interrupted by a war they had nothing to do with.

"(CNN) -- Wicked wintry weather that pummeled the West Coast is now barreling across the country, threatening to wreck millions of holiday travel plans just before Thanksgiving. Scores of car crashes and 12 fatalities are blamed on the storm. Nearly 200 flights out of Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport were canceled Monday, in addition to the nearly 300 canceled Sunday. Parts of Lubbock, known for its warmth and flatness, turned into a snowboarding park as several inches of snow covered the western Texas city. Sleet and freezing rain is possible beginning Tuesday from the southern Appalachians to parts of northern New England. And by midweek, the storm will start zeroing in on the Northeast, the National Weather Service said. And that could spell more travel nightmares. NOAA: Expect a dry winter in parts of Southeast, Southwest . How cold is cold? An Arctic air mass will probably keep temperatures 15 to 20 degrees below normal along the East Coast through Thursday. But even if the system fails to deliver heavy snow, fierce winds could still hamper air travel, forecasters said. Airlines flying in and out of Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport ""pre-canceled about 300 departures to reduce the number of stranded travelers"" Sunday in anticipation of the harsh weather, the airport's official Twitter account said. And 10% of flights at Oklahoma City's Will Rogers World Airport were also canceled because of the weather Sunday. Then there's the ice. CNN meteorologist Chad Myers called it ""probably the biggest problem for this storm."" Massive rainfall, too . The storm appeared to stall after it came over the Rocky Mountains, Myers said, but it is expected to pick up moisture from the Gulf and drop heavy rain as it runs up the East Coast. Heavy rain is expected to fall from Georgia on Monday night and over the Carolinas, with some sleet and snow mixed in for northern parts of that swath. The heaviest rain is expected across parts of Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, Florida and South Carolina. By Tuesday, the rain will reach the mid-Atlantic states and parts of the Northeast. And that could turn into freezing rain in the southern and central Appalachians. Deadly road conditions . Five people have died in weather-related crashes in Texas, the Texas Highway Patrol said Monday. Sgt. Chris Ray said half of his deputies handled 71 accidents over the weekend, and that number will rise when the other deputies report accident totals. The central Texas Panhandle seemed to be hardest hit, he said. Three of those killed in Texas were in a pileup on icy Interstate 40 in northwest Texas late Friday, Ray said. One of them was a man who got out of his car to help, and got struck. And at least 20 people were hospitalized from collisions within three miles of the fatal pileup, the Oldham County Sheriff's office said. Four people have died in Oklahoma since Friday, Betsy Randolph of the state's Department of Public Safety said. In each case, the driver was going too fast for conditions, she said. Randolph said only one of those killed was wearing a seat belt. Two people died in New Mexico in dangerous road conditions. A 4-year-old girl who was not properly restrained was killed Friday when the car she was riding in slid off icy U.S. Highway 70, the state's Department of Public Safety said. On Saturday, a woman in her 50s died when the pickup that she was riding in rear-ended a semi-truck in heavy traffic near Gallup, New Mexico, state police said. In Arkansas, authorities investigated 18 crashes in a two-mile section of Interstate 540 Monday morning, according to Lance King, troop commander for state police. The largest was a three-car pileup. Three people were transported from the scene, and there were no fatalities, he said. In Yuba County, California, a 52-year-old died when a tree fell on top of a vehicle Thursday, the county sheriff's office said. When will this storm end? By Thanksgiving Day, the storm will be giving the Northeast a layer of snow. But much of the country will enjoy calm Thanksgiving weather -- even if it's a little more frigid than usual. Fewer people traveling for Thanksgiving . CNN's Joe Sutton, Indra Petersons, Judson Jones, Adam Shivers and Janet DiGiacomo contributed to this report.","A dozen deaths are blamed on the weather across several states .

"London (CNN) -- The global economy will slow more than expected this year after being hit by the Ukraine crisis, market volatility and bad weather in the U.S., the World Bank says in its latest forecast. The bumpy recovery from crisis and emergence of new economic headwinds has prompted the World Bank to cut its global growth forecasts from 3.2% to 2.8%. However, its Global Economic Prospects report says the economy will improve later in 2014. Growth should then expand to 3.4% in 2015, ratcheting up another 0.1% in 2016, the report says. The acceleration will largely be from high-income countries such as the U.S. and euro area, as the markets recover and there is a ""steady release of pent-up demand,"" it says. Growth in developing markets will remain flat, staying under 5% for 2014 but it will expand next year, the report said. Restructuring in developed markets has offset ongoing risks from the crisis, the report notes, but ""more needs to be done."" Countries such as those in Europe, along with Japan and the U.S., must ensure they wind down their stimulus programs in an orderly way, it said.","Global economy will slow, the World Bank says in latest economic forecast .

"(CNN) -- As a new round of French military strikes targeted Islamist rebels in Mali on Sunday, both sides of the fight said they were determined to win. French fighter jets bombed rebel training camps and other targets in northern Mali, France's Defense Ministry said in a statement. ""France's goal is to lead a relentless struggle against terrorist groups,"" the ministry said, ""preventing any new offensive of these groups to the south of Mali."" Sunday's air raids were the latest in French efforts supporting Malian government forces battling militant Islamist forces. Additionally, France has several hundred ground troops in Mali, where they may soon be joined by hundreds of troops from nearby African nations. The U.N. Security Council -- at France's request -- will hold consultations Monday on the situation in Mali, according to France's U.N. mission. As those talks proceed, so too will French air strikes, French Defense Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian told Radio Europe 1. ""We have to eradicate this terrorism,"" he said. Islamist rebels in Mali acknowledged Sunday they suffered heavy losses in fights with the country's military and French troops -- but it wouldn't stop them. ""This is a holy war. The deaths are normal,"" Sanda Ould Boumama, spokesman for the al Qaeda-linked rebel group Ansar Dine, told CNN by phone. ""Our fighters are prepared to die for our cause."" One of Ansar Dine's lieutenants, Iyad Ag Ghaly, was killed in the fight over the central town of Konna, security sources said. Who is Ansar Dine? Insurgents took the town Thursday but retreated the next day after a combined air and ground assault. ""The war has only started,"" said Boumama. ""We expect more casualties."" He accused the French military of attacking Malians. ""Now the world can see that it's the French who are the real terrorists,"" he said. But French and Malian military officials say the assaults are against rebel strongholds, not civilians. It was unclear whether there were any casualties Sunday. Residents in the northern town of Gao said they heard fighter jets' roar and bomb blasts at a nearby Islamist rebel base. France's Defense Ministry said they ""destroyed"" multiple ""bases for terrorist groups"" in the area Sunday. ""It's still dangerous, even if they're not targeting the population,"" Habib Maiga, a teacher in Gao, said of the strikes. ""For the moment, the town is calm. Everyone is still inside, expecting a new attack."" Bodies lay on a road between the town and Islamist base, said Vieux Dada, another teacher in Gao. ""I believe they were Islamist fighters who tried to flee,"" he said. Mali's military has suffered heavy losses in previous clashes, including 11 soldiers killed and about 60 wounded in the battle for Konna, according to a government statement read on state TV. Additionally, a French helicopter pilot died while taking part Friday afternoon in an aerial operation targeting a terrorist group moving on the town of Mopti, near Konna, Le Drian said. What's behind the instability in Mali . A French colony until 1960, Mali had military rulers for decades until its first democratic elections in 1992. It remained stable politically until March, when a group of soldiers toppled the government, saying it had not provided adequate support for them to fight ethnic Tuareg rebels in the country's largely desert north. Tuareg rebels, who'd sought independence for decades, took advantage of the power vacuum and seized swaths of land. A power struggle then erupted in the north between the Tuaregs and local al Qaeda-linked radicals, who wound up in control of a large area as the Tuaregs retreated. The United Nations says amputations, floggings and public executions -- like the July stoning of a couple who had reportedly had an affair -- became common in areas controlled by radical Islamists. They applied a strict interpretation of Sharia law in banning music, smoking, drinking and watching sports on television, and damaged Timbuktu's historic tombs and shrines. Already, the armed groups' activity and a pervasive drought have displaced hundreds of thousands of Malians. And the Islamists' movement southward has raised concerns among leaders in West Africa and elsewhere, some of them calling for swift and decisive military intervention in support of Mali's government, based in Bamako. The Economic Community of West African States plans to hold an emergency meeting in Abidjan, Ivory Coast, to prepare to send troops to Mali to help government forces, a spokesman for the organization said. West African troops are expected to number 3,500 and will operate in the framework of the United Nations resolutions, ECOWAS spokesman Sunny Ugoh said. The U.N. Security Council last month authorized a one-year military peacekeeping mission in the country. ECOWAS members pledged thousands of troops, and the Security Council has urged other nations to contribute forces as well. French officials earlier expressed reluctance to send troops to Mali, amid a broader vow to scale back their military involvement in Africa. So the decision to get involved in Mali -- a mission French President Francois Hollande said ""will last as long as necessary"" -- underscores how concerned they are about the situation there. French hostages have been taken in neighboring Niger by al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, and Paris appears intent on containing any further militant expansion in the heart of Africa. On Sunday, a Twitter post from the office of Mali's president said Canada, Britain and the United States agreed to provide logistical support. British Prime Minister David Cameron agreed to ""provide logistical military assistance to help transport foreign troops and equipment quickly to Mali,"" but no British personnel in a combat role, a Downing Street spokesman said. The U.S. military is weighing options, including logistical support and intelligence sharing with France, a U.S. defense official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because no decisions have been made, said Saturday. ""This is a serious issue, and ... the United States is committed to going after terrorists wherever they may be in order to protect American interests, but also those of our partners and allies around the world,"" Pentagon spokesman George Little said last week. Journalist Katarina Hoije and CNN's Vladimir Duthiers and Saskya Vandoorne contributed to this report.","NEW: The U.N. Security Council will meet about Mali on Monday .

"(CNN) -- Sherry Johnston, whose son is having a baby with the daughter of Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, was arrested Thursday on drug charges, Alaska State Police said. Bristol Palin, the eldest daughter of Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, and her boyfriend, Levi Johnston, in September. Johnston's teenage son, Levi, is the boyfriend of Bristol Palin, eldest daughter of the former GOP vice-presidential nominee. Johnston was arrested in her home in Wasilla, Alaska, on six felony counts of misconduct involving a controlled substance, police said. The warrant resulted from an undercover investigation that ""had been going on for a while,"" Alaska State Trooper spokeswoman Megan Peters said.

"(CNN) -- You cannot look away from the twin disasters befalling the people of Syria and Iraq. That is what President Barack Obama has realized. More than three years after an uprising to topple Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad spun into a devastating civil war, Obama is asking Congress for $500 million to help arm and train the moderate Syrian opposition. It is late. More than 150,000 Syrians have already died. It's a staggering number. And the situation is only getting worse. Now Iraq, too, has become a battleground for sectarian conflict, threatening to create an even larger regional catastrophe. Competing groups and battling ideologies are at war, and the most extreme are fighting vigorously and making gains. There's no question that this is the most complicated of conflicts. Three-dimensional chess does not begin to describe it. But there is also no question that all the wrong people are winning. That's partly because those with moderate ideology have not received any support while others are bolstered by outside backers. Al-Assad, whose downfall seemed all but certain, receives military support from Iran and ground forces from Hezbollah, Lebanon's Iran-allied Shiite militia, which has helped him turn the tide in the battlefield. Obama threatened to intervene after al-Assad used chemical weapons, but backed away after a chemical disarmament deal, but al-Assad continues to slaughter civilians by the thousands. The rebels seeking to topple al-Assad, meanwhile, are deeply divided and are fighting each other. Moderates have lost ground to Islamist extremists, who receive support from Persian Gulf donors. Extremists are also divided. The Nusra Front, an al Qaeda arm in Syria, has broken with ISIS, the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. It is ISIS, whose brutality even al Qaeda considers excessive, that has swept across the Syrian border into Iraq. The more fanatical the group, the better it is doing. The radicals' advances attract more support and make their ideology more appealing, which strengthens their numbers. And groups like ISIS, now flush with cash, have no intention of stopping their expansion. Now the war in Syria has spilled in the worst possible way into Iraq, not only threatening the survival of that country but creating the very real possibility that a radical Islamist state of the most extremist kind could take root across both Syria and Iraq, creating a base of operations for attacks on U.S. allies, with Jordan first in line, and for terrorist training and planning. There's no question that finding ""moderates"" is a very difficult task. And it's certainly true that Obama's plan to start arming the moderate opposition is risky. The weapons could fall into the wrong hands, as they have in the past, and stepping even indirectly into a sectarian war is a perilous proposition. But this conflict has made even the most pessimistic prediction appear hopelessly optimistic. Some experts are calling this Middle East crisis the most dangerous one in 40 years. The scale of human suffering is staggering, and the stakes for long-term global stability enormous. The West's decision to stand on the sidelines has allowed the worst outcome to materialize. And it is morally indefensible. The Iraqi quandary now makes it all even more complicated. The United States does not want to take sides in a Sunni-Shiite war. America's interest is a return to peace and victory for those -- in Syria and Iraq -- who would protect human rights and rule of law. Washington is sending 300 advisers to work with the (mostly Shiite) Iraqi army. Now it will help arm the (mostly Sunni) moderate opposition in Syria. It is walking gingerly, projecting its nonsectarian position, as it should. The turbulent Middle East may look like a distant, foggy disaster area, but it has a history of sending ripples that reach close to home, changing life for people in other parts of the world. Already the war in Syria has attracted fighters from Western countries, from Europe and the United States. Syria and now Iraq are becoming training grounds for would-be terrorists. European security agencies are sounding panicked about what this means for terrorism at home. ""The threat of attack has never been greater,"" one European counterterrorism official said. FBI director James Comey said thousands of Europeans have traveled to Syria to fight with Islamists. Dozens of Americans have joined them. An American suicide bomber -- from Florida -- blew himself up in Syria recently. Some of those violent jihadists with American and European passports, which allow them to travel easily almost anywhere, are returning home. A French citizen just back from Syria has been charged with killing four people in Brussels' Jewish Museum. Bomb threats, like one a few days ago in Amsterdam, are being treated extremely seriously. The Dutch intelligence service says Dutch jihadis are returning to the Netherlands, bringing dangerous ideological baggage, determined to commit attacks on the West and radicalize Dutch Muslims. British Prime Minister David Cameron calls the terrorist threat from Syria ""the biggest risk we face."" As counterterrorism officials in the United States and Europe try to prevent attacks, the fighting in Syria and Iraq is destroying lives, creating a generation of traumatized people who may seek revenge, perpetuating this conflict and threatening to tear apart the Middle East. Millions have been forced to leave their homes. Refugee camps are overflowing. Each individual in Iraq or Syria who has left home, each child who has been displaced by the war, has endured experiences we can scarcely comprehend. It may be easier to look away, to say the problem is just too complicated, and that it's not ours to deal with. But the humanitarian, strategic and security ramifications have become impossible to ignore. Obama discovered he cannot look away. Neither should we.","President Obama is asking Congress for $500 million to aid Syrian opposition .

"Monterrey, Mexico (CNN) -- Dozens died and 30 inmates escaped during a weekend prison riot in northern Mexico, an official said Monday. The prison's director and 18 guards have been removed from their positions and are under investigation, Nuevo Leon Gov. Rodrigo Medina told reporters. ""There is no doubt that without the help of prison officials, it would have been very hard to make this escape. ... For us, it is difficult to confirm that the betrayal, corruption and complicity of a few can hinder the work of good police, soldiers and sailors who risk their lives daily for the security of Nuevo Leon's residents,"" he said. Authorities are offering a reward of 10 million pesos (about $788,000) for information leading to the escapees' capture, Medina said. Preliminary reports indicate the escapees were members of the Zetas drug cartel, he said. A fierce rivalry between drug cartels likely fueled the fighting that killed 44 people Sunday inside the prison in Apodaca, Nuevo Leon, state security spokesman Jorge Domene told reporters. At least two Zetas leaders, including the suspected head of the cartel in the nearby industrial city of Monterrey, were among the prisoners who escaped, according to Mexican military records. Prisoners could have used the riot to engineer their breakout, Domene said Sunday. He did not say how prisoners inside acquired the clubs, stones and sharp objects they used in the fighting. Earlier Sunday, Domene said inmates had taken a guard hostage as clashes broke out at the prison. Some prisoners also set mattresses ablaze, sending smoke rising above the facility, he said. Federal and state police surrounded the prison as anxious family members awaited information outside its gates. The clashes, which occurred in a part of the prison where most inmates were serving time for federal drug trafficking offenses, might have begun as a fight between the Zetas and Gulf cartels, Domene said. The Zetas started with deserters from the Mexican Army and quickly gained a reputation for ruthless violence as the armed branch of Mexico's Gulf cartel. The partnership ended in 2010, and turf battles between the rival cartels are common in northern Mexico. State officials have asked Mexico's interior ministry to transfer inmates connected with federal offenses out of the prison, which has become significantly overcrowded as authorities crack down on organized crime, Medina said Monday. The Apodaca prison was housing about 3,000 prisoners at the time of Sunday's riot, Domene said Sunday. Last year, 14 inmates were killed and 35 people were injured in a fire in the prison's psychiatric ward. Nearly half of Mexico's 428 penitentiary centers are overcrowded, according to federal police statistics. After more than 350 people died in a fire in a Honduran prison last week, a United Nations official said widespread overcrowding was one factor behind a recent wave of violence in Latin American prisons. ""These events reflect an alarming pattern of prison violence in the region, which is a direct consequence of -- or aggravated by -- a range of endemic problems including chronic prison overcrowding, the lack of access to basic services such as adequate floor space, potable water, food, health care and lack of basic sanitary and hygienic standards,"" Rupert Colville, a spokesman for the high commissioner for human rights, said in a statement. In Mexico, prison expert Jose Luis Musi said conditions remain ripe for more violence. ""There are many factors,"" he said. ""There is overpopulation, there is complicity and there is a lack of security."" CNN's Rey Rodriguez in Mexico City, journalist Victor Badillo in Monterrey and CNNMexico.com contributed to this report.","NEW: A Zetas cartel leader is among the escapees, officials say .

"(CNN) -- Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan has suddenly shifted his attitude toward the Islamist extremist group Boko Haram, as violence spreads across northern Nigeria. A week ago, Jonathan warned the group had infiltrated the government and security forces and vowed (again) to stamp it out. But in an interview with Reuters news agency Thursday he said that if Boko Haram identified itself and stated clear demands the government was ready for dialogue. He also acknowledged that military action alone would not stop Boko Haram; and northern Nigeria needed economic development. But Nigeria-watchers think this apparent carrot may have come too late. Boko Haram's purported leader, Abu Bakar Shekau, responded in an audio message: ""We're killing police officers, we're killing soldiers and other government people who are fighting Allah; and Christians who are killing Muslims and talking badly about our Islamic religion."" Over the last month, Boko Haram has carried out multiple bombings and shootings across the north; hundreds of people have been killed. Its targets are frequently police and government officials, but most of the casualties are civilians. On one day last week, at least 200 people were killed in Nigeria's second city, Kano. (On Monday, militants launched new attacks.) Who are the Boko Haram? One Nigeria analyst describes the Kano attacks as a ""breathtaking show of force"" by Boko Haram -- one that fits a pattern of bolder and better coordinated attacks over the past year. Joe Bavier, a writer who is a frequent visitor to the region, told CNN that the ""federal government has completely lost control of the north-east, despite deploying thousands of troops and establishing a Joint Task Force."" Now, he says, ""it looks like this insurgency has broken out of the north-east."" And what's worrying, he says, is that there's ""not a whole lot of visible effort from the federal government to calm things down."" Nigerian iReporters on uncertain present, and future . Philippe de Pontet, Africa analyst at the Eurasia Group, says that Boko Haram's main aim appears to be humiliate Jonathan's government, tapping into an existing sense of grievance among Muslims in the north. He and other analysts say the government's heavy-handed response has played into Boko Haram's hands. ""The impulse is to hit back hard and there are political pressures for a crackdown,"" de Pontet argues, ""but Jonathan is so weak in the north that he needs to be careful not to alienate people there further."" Long the poorer part of Nigeria, the north lacks infrastructure such as reliable power. Since the end of military rule much of the region has felt excluded from the system of patronage that fuels Nigerian politics. When he acceded to the presidency in April last year, Jonathan broke the unofficial rotation of Christian and Muslim as head of state. Goodluck Jonathan: Nigeria's embattled president . Bavier, who is with the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting, says poverty has fed Boko Haram's ranks. It is no longer a sect of Islamic fanatics but has the support of disgruntled politicians and their paid thugs. One source says young men are being paid as little as $2 a day to take part in the group's attacks. Compounding the situation, the government has so far treated Boko Haram as a security problem rather than a political problem. Because of a lack of trust, security forces find it hard to gather actionable intelligence and different security branches often compete with each other rather than share information. A former U.S. ambassador to Nigeria, John Campbell, says the response of the security forces so far has been ""abysmal"" -- which is probably why the inspector-general of police was fired this week. The State Security Service is probably the most competent branch, he says, but doesn't share intelligence. Bavier agrees: ""The security and intelligence apparatus is entirely stove-piped."" The scale of the attacks, and the subsequent discovery by police of new pick-up trucks in Kano wired to explode, suggests Boko Haram is not short of money. That in turn sparks another debate. Some analysts believe it is financing its activities through extortion and bank robberies. But the Nigerian government, the United Nations and U.S. officials say there is evidence Boko Haram is part of a wider west African jihadist movement, and has developed links with al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb. A U.N. report issued last week says arms smuggling throughout the region in the wake of the Libyan revolution is rampant. ""Large quantities of weapons and ammunition from Libyan stockpiles were smuggled into the Sahel region,"" the report said. The weapons included rocket-propelled grenades, explosives and even anti-aircraft artillery. ""Some of the weapons may be hidden in the desert and could be sold to terrorist groups like al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, Boko Haram or other criminal organizations,"" the U.N. report said. Philippe de Pontet of Eurasia says the increasing use of suicide bombings ""speak to the real possibility that this movement is getting support, training and possibly finance from outside."" But, he says, Boko Haram did not grow out of al Qaeda; nor is there any evidence of foreign fighters among its ranks. Campbell agrees, noting that its recent statements have not included jihadist slogans or anti-western rhetoric. While contacts with other groups are possible, there is no indication of close co-ordination. The U.N. report notes that ""although Boko Haram has concentrated its terrorist acts inside Nigeria, seven of its members were arrested while transiting through Niger to Mali."" They were allegedly carrying contact details for known al Qaeda members. Just as the jury is out on Boko Haram's relationship with global jihad, so there is great uncertainty about its aims and structure. Different spokesmen focus on different demands, and government officials have said there is no leadership or manifesto they can address. Last month, one Boko Haram spokesman demanded all Christians leave the north within three days, and a subsequent video made by Abu Bakr Shekau, railed against Christians. ""They killed us, destroyed our mosques and displaced us,"" he said. ""The Christian religion that you are practicing is not the religion of Allah; rather -- it is unbelief."" But John Campbell, now with the Council on Foreign Relations and author of ""Nigeria: Dancing on the Brink,"" says it would be simplistic to regard Boko Haram as a cohesive group motivated mainly by animosity for Christians. There is a strand that follows the strict version of Islam preached by its founder, Mohammed Yousuf; there are opportunists who rob banks and traffic arms; and there are northern politicians drawing on the discontent that Boko Haram represents. Campbell and Bavier also point out that Boko Haram has frequently attacked figures in the wealthy Muslim establishment too -- accusing them of selling out to the federal government and not adhering to Sharia law. Bavier says many of the poor regard the traditional Muslim hierarchy as complicit in their misery. After the 2011 elections, crowds attacked and burned down the home of the Sultan of Sokoto, a pillar of the Muslim hierarchy who had supported Jonathan. Even if Boko Haram's aim is not to split Nigeria into religious camps, the effect of its violent attacks could be hugely divisive, according to de Pontet. ""If they continue to escalate,"" he says, ""they could tear apart the ethnic and sectarian tapestry of Nigeria in slow motion."" Despite its many problems, Nigeria has natural wealth and a growth rate of 7%. Boko Haram is unlikely to have much impact on the broader economy, but Nigeria's boom is concentrated in the south and may lead to even greater inequality, and a still greater sense of grievance among the marginalized Muslim communities in the north. Jonathan's olive branch may be intended to avoid that risk. But there is considerable political pressure on him not to make concessions to terrorists. And there is every sign that some elements of Boko Haram prefer a future of extortion -- and explosions.","Islamist extremist group Boko Haram has been blamed for multiple attacks in Nigeria .

"(CNN) -- Phil Jackson and Derek Fisher won five NBA championships when the former coached the latter in Los Angeles. Now, the two hope their latest partnership will achieve great things in New York. The New York Knicks on Tuesday introduced longtime NBA player Fisher as the team's 26th head coach. Fisher, 39, just wrapped up his NBA playing career, playing last season for the Oklahoma City Thunder. He replaces Mike Woodson, who was fired after the Knicks failed to make the playoffs this season. Jackson, the Knicks' new president, made Fisher his first coaching hire. Though this will be Fisher's first head coaching job at any level, Jackson said Fisher was the perfect choice, in part because of their shared experiences in Los Angeles. ""He's learned under some of the best coaches,"" Jackson told reporters Tuesday morning -- naming Don Nelson, Jerry Sloan and Scott Brooks but leaving out himself. Jackson ""obviously left himself off the list,"" Fisher said. Jackson the coach and Fisher the guard helped the Lakers to championships in 2000, 2001, 2002, 2009 and 2010. Fisher said that although this is his first attempt as coach, he has valuable experience in the game as a player and champion. ""That (being a champion) I have experience in, and that is an experience I plan on sharing"" with the Knicks' players, Fisher said.","Former NBA player Derek Fisher named Knicks' 26th head coach .

"(CNN) -- Storyteller Mark Twain ignited an American love affair with the Mississippi River in the late 1800s with his vivid descriptions in ""The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn"" and ""Life on the Mississippi."" Twain described river towns as ""pleasing to the eye and cheering to the spirit"" and called the Mississippi Valley ""as reposeful as a dreamland ... nothing to hang a fret or a worry upon."" More than a century later, the romance of the mighty Mississippi, along with a number of other U.S. waterways, continues to attract those seeking an authentic slice of Americana, and a number of cruise lines cater to travelers looking for such a floating escape. Onboard today's passenger vessels you're likely to find a library with a book or two by Twain -- along with fine dining, live entertainment, expert lecturers and multiple options for relaxing, or maintaining a fitness regime. Trips gone wrong: Movie moments . U.S. river cruising has been growing in popularity for many reasons: These journeys have a European feel with no passport required, they work for multiple generations traveling together, and the logistics make it a breeze compared with getting on a plane or even sailing with the bigger cruise lines. Traditionally filled with a more mature travel crowd, they aren't cheap. But those who take one river cruise tend to take more; one popular outfit, American Cruise Lines, reports a repeat guest rate of 40% on average. Here are eight ways to explore the United States via river cruise: . Memphis to New Orleans: Lower Mississippi River .

Every autumn, when the riverbanks are drenched in shades of red and gold, the elegant flagship vessel of the American Queen Steamboat Co. travels the Upper Mississippi River, with stops that include a glimpse of Amish country in La Crosse, Wisconsin, and a tribute to the agricultural accomplishments of John Deer in Davenport, Iowa. Twain's boyhood home of Hannibal, Missouri, is also on the itinerary. Other themed sailings on the American Queen honor everything from baseball legends to Route 66, and longer itineraries sail on multiple rivers. Rates begin at $2,495 per person for the nine-day journey, $4,495 for a 14-day trip on the Ohio and Mississippi. World's 15 best rivers for travelers . Pacific Northwest: Columbia and Snake rivers .

The journey takes you through all five of the Great Lakes, from Lake Ontario to Lake Superior. The 138-passenger Yorktown passes through busy locks and canals on this 11-day trip filled with Great Lake lore as well as excursion options to Niagara Falls, Michigan's pristine Presque Isle and the Victorian-era island of Mackinac. Travelers yearning for still more Americana should head for the Henry Ford Museum and Greenfield Village when the ship docks in Detroit for a day.

"(CNN)  -- Sen. Barack Obama said he was ""deeply disappointed"" by a sermon at his church this week that mocked Sen. Hillary Clinton. A video making the rounds on YouTube shows the Rev. Michael Pfleger mocking Clinton for becoming teary-eyed before the New Hampshire primary in January. In the video, Pfleger wipes his eyes with a handkerchief and suggests Clinton wept because she thought that as a white person and the wife of a former president, she was entitled to the presidency. ""And then, out of nowhere, came 'Hey, I'm Barack Obama,' "" Pfleger said during a sermon Sunday at  Trinity United Church of Christ in Chicago, Illinois. ""And [Clinton] said, 'Oh damn, where did you come from?  I'm white!  I'm entitled!  There's a black man stealing my show!' ""   Watch Pfleger mock Clinton Â» . The video shows the congregation laughing and cheering. Pfleger is a Catholic priest at St. Sabina Roman Catholic Church on Chicago's southwest side. He is also a friend of Trinity's former pastor, the Rev. Jeremiah Wright, from whom Obama distanced himself in April. At the time, Obama said he was ""outraged"" by Wright's remarks suggesting the U.S. government might be responsible for the spread of AIDS in the black community and equating some American wartime efforts with terrorism. Obama has known Pfleger for more than 20 years. His campaign condemned Pfleger's comments. ""As I have traveled this country, I've been impressed not by what divides us, but by all that that unites us,"" Obama said in a statement Thursday. ""That is why I am deeply disappointed in Father Pfleger's divisive, backward-looking rhetoric, which doesn't reflect the country I see or the desire of people across America to come together in common cause."" The Clinton camp also condemned Pfleger's remarks. ""Divisive and hateful language like that is totally counterproductive in our efforts to bring our party together and have no place at the pulpit or in our politics,"" the Clinton campaign said. ""We are disappointed that Sen. Obama didn't specifically reject Father's Pfleger's despicable comments about Sen. Clinton and assume he will."" Pfleger apologized for his comments Thursday evening. ""I regret the words I chose on Sunday,"" he said in a statement. ""These words are inconsistent with Sen. Obama's life and message, and I am deeply sorry if they offended Sen.

"Sevare, Mali (CNN) -- International backing for French forces battling Islamist militants in Mali gathered momentum Tuesday, as U.S. military aircraft flew French troops and supplies into the African nation and Italy's lawmakers voted to lend support. The U.S. mission began Monday with two flights and is expected to continue for several days, U.S. Africa Command spokesman Chuck Prichard told CNN from Stuttgart. U.S. C-17 planes are taking off from southern France loaded with French cargo and dropping it off in the Malian capital, Bamako, he said. The U.S. support is at the request of the French, who intervened in Mali 11 days ago after a plea for help from its government. The French are involved in the fight because Mali once was under the country's control, and because Islamists have been threatening to turn the once-peaceful democracy into a haven for international terrorists. Italy's lower house of parliament approved sending 15 to 24 military instructors who will work alongside the European Union in training Malian forces. It also agreed to provide logistical support to include at least two cargo planes. The time frame for Italy to provide the assistance is not yet decided. Leaders from several other countries have already offered troops or logistical support. Canada and Britain are deploying military transport aircraft, while Nigeria is set to deploy soldiers as part of the U.N.-mandated African force to fight the insurgents. Meanwhile, the battle continues to push back rebel forces on the ground. On the road between Segou and Bamako on Tuesday, a CNN crew saw a large column of French mechanized infantry barreling toward northern Mali. Dozens of armored fighting vehicles packed with supplies appeared headed for the front line of the battle against Islamist fighters. On Monday, Malian forces recaptured the central town of Diabaly, as well as the town of Douentza, to the northeast, from al Qaeda-linked rebels. A spokesman for the Malian military told CNN it had won control of the latter without the aid of French air support. In his address to the United Nations Tuesday, Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said ""political, security and humanitarian efforts"" are needed to meet the challenges faced by Mali. ""Working with African and international partners, we must do our part to help fully restore Mali's constitutional order and territorial integrity,"" he said. ""Meanwhile, we continue to work toward an integrated strategy for the Sahel region that would address the mix of extremism, poverty, drought and governance challenges that is causing such profound misery and dangerous insecurity."" Sahel is the area along the southern edge of the Sahara. Monday's military gains for Malian forces came as the government extended the country's state of emergency for another three months. ""This advance by the Malian army toward the cities held by their enemies constitutes a certain military success for the Bamako government and for French forces, who have intervened in support of these operations,"" French Defense Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said. He stated his ""total confidence"" in French forces in a mission that ""aims to restore sovereignty to Mali on its territory and to prevent the risk of the constitution of a terrorist sanctuary in the heart of Africa."" France currently has 2,150 soldiers on Malian soil, with another 1,000 troops supporting the operation from elsewhere, the defense ministry said. Between 700 and 800 African troops from Benin, Nigeria, Togo and Burkina Faso have arrived in Mali, according to U.S. State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland. Senegalese troops and up to 2,000 from Chad are on the way, she said. Journalists are still barred from traveling into northern Mali, which has been under the control of militant Islamists for several months. But the CNN crew was able to enter Diabaly on Monday, where it was told by Malian and French forces that Islamists left after they were hit directly in one of their makeshift camps by the French and Malians. The scene after one battle included burned-out armored vehicles and a truck that at one point belonged to the Islamists. A Malian officer, Col. Seydou Sogoba, told CNN that the Islamists were using sophisticated weapons like he had never seen before. He believes they originated in Libya. As the news crew drove into town, the dusty streets in the extremely poor area were mostly empty except for military vehicles and French and Malian troops. Whatever trucks had belonged to the Islamist rebels were bombed and burned out. Destroyed high-caliber weapons were seen in the vehicles. A French colonel, exhausted from fighting and who wished not to be named, told CNN that foreign fighters -- including some who are Algerian -- had been pushed out of the area. Sogoba told CNN the fight against the rebels was very hard, but he is focused on ""preserving the national integrity"" of Mali. French President Francois Hollande has said that if his country had not intervened, Mali ""probably would have fallen into the hands of terrorists."" French involvement began the day after militants said January 10 that they had seized the city of Konna, east of Diabaly in central Mali, and were poised to advance south toward Bamako. Ethnic Tuaregs who had returned to Mali well-armed from fighting for late Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi staged a military coup last year against the Malian government. Islamic extremists capitalized on the chaos, carved out a large haven in Mali's north and imposed a strict interpretation of Sharia law. The Islamists banned music, smoking, drinking and watching sports on television. They also destroyed historic tombs and shrines. Those events stoked fear among global security experts that Mali could become a new hub for terrorism. Meanwhile, the Norwegian Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre warned that the humanitarian crisis in Mali is worsening. Because Algeria has closed its borders, people in the north are increasingly heading to the desert, where they will face harsh conditions and struggles over food and water with limited humanitarian assistance, the group said. ""They cannot stay where they are due to the grave insecurity caused by the conflict,"" said Sebastian Albuja, head of the center's Africa and Americas Department. ""Yet the meager resources and the diminished coping abilities of the government and humanitarian actors means that they are faced with limited options."" Many are fleeing on foot because they can't afford boats or buses, Albuja said, and even if they do make it, they get there only to find the roads blocked. The violence could soon displace up to 700,000 in the country and around the region, said Melissa Fleming, a spokeswoman for the United Nations' refugee agency.

"(CNN) -- There he goes again -- Russian President Vladimir Putin, portraying himself as the world's champion of peace and democracy. And, of course, doing it at America's expense. This time, Putin's PR machine managed to get him an op-ed in The New York Times, just in time for the start of talks in Geneva, Switzerland, over a plan to dismantle Syria's chemical weapons arsenal. The column is so filled with hypocrisy, inaccuracies and even veiled threats that it's hard to know where to begin. Putin chastises the United States, which has stumbled badly in Syria, for considering an attack because a strike ""will result in more innocent victims and escalation."" It could, he warns, ""unleash a new wave of terrorism."" He forgets to mention that tens of thousands of innocent victims in Syria have already died at the hands of President Bashar al-Assad's forces, which are armed, supported and supplied by Moscow. Here's just one recent arms order from a Syrian army general, listing 20,000 Kalashnikov rifles, 20 million rounds of ammunition, sniper rifles, machine guns, grenade launchers and more. When it comes to massacres of civilians, it is the Russian (and Iranian)-armed Syrian government and its allies who have done most of the killing. Some of the rebels also have blood on their hands, clearly a reason for concern. But Putin's one-sided portrayal is false. A report by a U.N. commission released Wednesday showed eight massacres committed by al-Assad supporters and one by rebels over the last year and a half. Putin has provided al-Assad with weapons, planeloads of cash and diplomatic cover to carry out his assaults against an uprising that started peacefully and was forced into violence by al-Assad's uncompromising response. And yet in his op-ed Putin cynically describes the Syrian war as conflict ""fueled by foreign weapons supplied to the opposition."" The Russian president tries to come across as the great defender of international institutions, peace through compromise and global consensus. ""No one wants the United Nations to suffer the fate of the League of Nations,"" he warns, which would happen if the United States chooses to bypass the U.N. Security Council. The truth, whatever Putin claims, is that the United States and other countries have tried desperately to go through the Security Council to stop the carnage in Syria. No country has obstructed those efforts more persistently than Russia. Early last year, when al-Assad's forces carried out what was until then the worst massacre of the war, in the city of Homs, the United States, France, Britain -- in fact, 13 out of the Security Council's 15 members -- voted in favor of a resolution backing an Arab peace plan for Syria. Russia and China vetoed it. Experts then said the outcome would be a ""license (for al-Assad) to do more of the same and worse,"" predicting the Syrian leader would become even more brutal in his tactics, exactly as he has. Russia has obstructed even the most watered-down efforts to send a message from the international community, vetoing three separate resolutions. It's no wonder Samantha Power, America's ambassador to the United Nations, said Russia has held the Security Council ""hostage."" In his column, Putin disingenuously claims ""there is every reason to believe"" the rebels launched the August 21 chemical attack that killed hundreds of Syrian civilians. Precisely the opposite is true. Analyses from the United States, France, the United Kingdom, Human Rights Watch and others have concluded that it was the regime that perpetrated that gross violation of international norms -- the norms that Putin now claims to embrace with such fervor. A U.N. inspection team investigated the massacre in Syria but was not tasked with assigning blame. Still, leaked information says its report next week will show ""a wealth of evidence"" pointing strongly to the Syrian regime as perpetrator of the attack, even if that doesn't fit neatly with Putin's reality distortion objectives. Nothing could be more deliciously absurd than Putin accusing America of not being a ""model of democracy,"" except perhaps for his closing line in which he chastises President Barack Obama for speaking of American exceptionalism. Obama shouldn't have said that, Putin humbly explains, because ""We are all different, but when we ask for the Lord's blessings, we must not forget that God created us equal."" Right. All equal. That coming from the man who has presided over the introduction of law after law turning gays and lesbians into second-class citizens in Russia, with the latest allowing police to arrest anyone suspected of being ""pro-gay."" Putin would do well to avoid the topic of democracy and human rights altogether. Just ask the nonpartisan Freedom House what has happened to the country since Putin came to dominate the political scene more than a decade ago. Incidentally, Putin rose to power by cracking down violently against Chechnya. Here's an op-ed he published in The New York Times in 1999 explaining why force was needed against brutality. In this latest newspaper column, Putin extends to the United States his image-building campaign from Russia, where he has appeared hunting tigers in Siberia. In Russia he is the hyper-macho president. In America and in the rest of the world, he wants the public to see him as the indispensable foil to an out-of-control America. Putin wants to raise not only his own but also Russia's profile and prestige. It's not so much that he dislikes American exceptionalism. He wants Russia to share in the limelight and in the power. The former KGB man is trying to maximize the influence of a country that once shared the title of superpower only with the United States. To do that, he wants to save al-Assad, the man who holds the key to Russia's foothold in the Arab Middle East. No, Putin's actions are not driven by a passion for peace and democracy. They are an example of cold calculation -- a quest for power and a bold display of hypocrisy. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Frida Ghitis.","Frida Ghitis: In op-ed, Putin poses as champion of peace and chastises U.S. on Syria .

"(CNN)  -- The Transportation Security Administration has launched an internal investigation into an air marshal field office in Florida where supervisors are alleged to have used a crew assignment board to ridicule and keep score on women, gays and minorities, sources told CNN.

"Washington (CNN) -- The U.S. government said Wednesday it is holding a Somali man on immigration violations, but gave no indication why the man was deemed to be a threat to a commercial jet that was denied permission to overfly the United States on Sunday. However, the brother of Abdirahman Ali Gaal, the detained man, said U.S. officials may be suspicious because of Gaal's outspoken views about U.S. policy in the Middle East, his frequent comments on an Internet website, and his recent travel to Mauritania in northern Africa to study Islam. Abdifatah Gaal described his brother as ""confused"" by the detention because he had been assured by U.S. authorities while overseas that there was no impediment to his return to the United States. The case of Abdirahman Ali Gaal came to a head Sunday when U.S. authorities denied permission for the Aeromexico flight he was on -- traveling from Paris, France, to Mexico City, Mexico -- to overfly the United States. The flight was diverted to Montreal, where Canadian officials took custody of Gaal before turning him over to U.S. officials Tuesday. U.S. officials have since said that Gaal was on the ""no fly"" list, compiled by the government, of people banned from flying in the United States. Matthew Chandler, a Department of Homeland Security spokesman, said Wednesday that Gaal was questioned by U.S. officials. ""In the course of that interview process, he was determined to be inadmissible to the United States and is currently being detained pending immigration proceedings,"" Chandler said. Gaal admitted to having committed fraud when he applied for refugee status in Canada in October 2008 and to abandoning his ""legal permanent residency"" status in the United States by departing the U.S. for more than 10 months and applying for refugee status in Canada, a U.S. official told CNN on condition of not being identified by name. Immigration issues of that sort, however, do not typically put a person on the ""no fly"" list, which includes about 6,000 people, the official acknowledged. U.S. officials declined to provide any further information about the matter. Gaal's brother, contacted Wednesday by CNN, said Gaal had strong political beliefs but has insisted he had done nothing wrong. Abdifatah Gaal said his brother was critical of U.S. policies in the Middle East and aired his views on Paltalk, which hosts Internet chat forums. Several months ago, he said, his brother went to Mauritania in northern Africa to study Islam. While in Mauritania, Gaal received a call from his wife in Toronto, saying she had been visited by Canadian police looking for him. Gaal then went to the U.S. Embassy in Mauritania and was told there was no impediment to him returning home, according to his brother. Gaal also called the FBI to check on his status, his brother said. Gaal flew to Paris and on to Mexico City, and intended to travel to Seattle, Washington, where their mother lives, his brother said. Abdifatah Gaal said his brother's arm was broken when he was removed from the aircraft in Montreal, even though, he said, Gaal did not resist. He said the family is trying to hire an immigration attorney to represent his brother.","Man triggered weekend diversion of an Aeromexico flight .

"Abuja, Nigeria (CNN) -- In Nigeria, nobody speaks of terrible things. Where some unimaginable atrocity has been committed the news is often met with pursed lips, a double snap of the fingers and a swift motion over ones head to invoke a purge against evil. To speak of terror is to welcome it into one's life. A terrible thing happened in Nigeria on Independence Day. In the small town of Mubi in the North-east, 25 students were rounded up a few hours before midnight. Their names were called out one by one. This was no typical roll call, however. The owner of each name that was called was swiftly executed by unidentified gunmen. No group has yet claimed responsibility. However Mubi is situated in Adamawa state which has become volatile of recent, an unwilling hotbed for the radical group, Boko Haram. Opinion: Nigeria is a sinking ship, but we must not desert it . The cold blooded massacre is one of the worst to hit an educational institution in Nigeria and yet nobody is really talking about it. It is not a hot topic at the workplace or on the streets. The public mood is palpably apathetic. Two full days later and the news is only just filtering through to many. Even where there is a flicker of interest, pursed lips, double finger click, arms raised. Next topic. Thank you very much. The federal government has responded typically which is to say that the old book of cliches has been dusted down for frantic recital. No stone unturned. Perpetrators brought to book. Remote and immediate causes will be investigated. The cliches are often peppered with words like probe and investigative and panel. Read more from the author . There is something sacred about learning institutions. When one thinks of the more infamous attacks on educational institutions -- Dunblane, Columbine, Toulouse, Erfurt -- it is shocking to see there is not a similar outpouring of grief in Nigeria over those who died in Monday's attack. The sad truth is that insecurity has now become a constant companion for many Nigerians. As a result there is no longer any shock value. Attacks segue seamlessly into more attacks at a pace that makes it impossible to distinguish, digest or mourn appropriately. Read related: Suicide bomb kills 2 at Nigerian church . Disbelief has made way for indifference as no one simply knows how to respond anymore. One week a church is hit, another a mosque. Today a newspaper headquarters is bombed tomorrow a petrol station is set ablaze. The pattern of violence is predictably indiscriminate. The strategy to combat the rising insecurity -- if indeed there is a strategy -- is not a winning one. Eyewitnesses to the Mubi killings say the shooting lasted for almost two hours uninterrupted after which the killers casually disappeared into the night. The latest attack will once again question the imperative of a regional or state police force. The national police system is crumbling under the weight of increased responsibility. The argument, which is slowly gaining traction, is that a local police force would have a far greater appreciation of the terrain, natives and nuances of a particular place. The current practice of stationing police officers in completely unfamiliar surroundings puts them at an obvious disadvantage. However even if a state police system becomes a reality, the long term solution to tackling insecurity must go beyond fighting fire with fire. There are more fundamental issues at play. The disparity that exists between Nigerians is greater now than it has ever been. There are no new interconnecting roads and bridges to reconnect cities and states. Strangers remain strangers. It will always be easier to maim or kill those that are unfamiliar to you. A greater push must be made to plan and budget public spending that will be used to finance the ever deepening infrastructure deficit. Where idleness exists crime and violence invariably follow. The inordinate amount of unemployed Nigerians can be linked directly to rising insecurity levels. There is insufficient power to energize the productive energy of the economy. Cosmetic initiatives such as the almajiri school system, which combines Muslim and western education, are rubric failures. People have to eat before they can learn. An empty stomach is the poorest of receptacles for qualitative learning. A better initiative would be to establish commodity boards to buy produce at government guaranteed prices. This puts money in the hands of the poor rural farmers who are most vulnerable yet paradoxically have the responsibility of feeding a country. The human potential of a satiated nation is close to infinite. A full belly is the most effective distraction against crime. Until such measures are put in place the Nigerian society will need to rediscover the ability to police itself. The growing number of atrocities is being perpetrated by people indigenous to the area. Rising insurgency has led to rising insularity. Neighbors are now regarded with suspicion. It is a harsh truth to bear. There are killers in the midst of everyday Nigerians. Only a greater acceptance of civic duties; to observe and report suspicious behavior can expose those that lurk in the shadows yet continue to wreak havoc across the land. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Terfa Tilley-Gyado.","Political commentator says Nigerians largely indifferent to growing security threat .

"(CNN) -- Mexican authorities have captured a suspected leader of the Gulf cartel, officials said Tuesday. A man who ""is presumed to be and says he is"" Mario Cardenas Guillen was detained Monday in the northern state of Tamaulipas, a spokesman for Mexico's navy told reporters. His brother, Osiel Cardenas Guillen, was the cartel's founder and former leader. A U.S. federal judge sentenced him to 25 years in prison in 2010 after he pleaded guilty to five felony charges, including conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute, conspiracy to launder money and threatening to assault and kill federal agents. Mario Cardenas Guillen, also known as ""M1"" and ""The Fat One,"" became one of the cartel's top leaders that year, after another brother was killed in a Mexican military operation, officials said. Authorities had previously accused him of helping to run aspects of the cartel's operation while he was in a Mexican prison on organized crime charges. From inside prison, authorities said he operated an auto body workshop that outfitted cars with compartments used to transport cocaine and marijuana to the United States. He was released from prison in 2007. On Tuesday, Vice Adm. Jose Luis Vergara Ibarra, a spokesman for Mexico's navy, said Mario Cardenas Guillen was connected with a number of pending cocaine trafficking cases. The Gulf cartel is one of Mexico's major drug-trafficking organizations. It is based in the Mexican city of Matamoros, across the border from Brownsville, Texas. The cartel split into two factions after its former leader, Antonio Cardenas Guillen -- also known as Tony the Storm -- was killed in a military operation in 2010, Vergara told reporters Tuesday. Authorities announced the arrest of Mario Cardenas Guillen a day after Mexican President Felipe Calderon defended his drug war strategy in his final state of the union speech. More than 47,500 people have been killed in drug-related violence across Mexico since Calderon deployed federal troops to combat cartels shortly after taking office in December 2006. The Mexican government has not released official statistics since January, and others estimate a much higher death toll. On Monday, Calderon blamed fighting between rival cartels for the violence. ""Federal intervention has not been the problem. It has been part of the solution,"" he said. Calderon, who will leave office when his term ends in December, urged Mexico's next government to continue the fight against organized crime.

"(CNN) -- A Washoe County, Nevada, jury Wednesday sentenced a Nevada pipe fitter to death for the killing of a 19-year-old student in a string of attacks that rattled the university community in Reno two years ago. James Michael Biela, 28, was convicted last week of first-degree murder and sexual assault in the death of Brianna Denison. He also was convicted of two counts of sexual assault for attacks on two other women and of one count of kidnapping relating to one of those attacks. The jury spent three hours behind closed doors Tuesday night and resumed deliberations Wednesday morning. On Tuesday, Denison's mother, Bridgette, told them to show no mercy for the man who killed her daughter and sexually assaulted two other college coeds. Denison, a sophomore at Santa Barbara City College in California, was last seen alive on her friend's couch on January 20, 2008. Three weeks later, her body was found in a field near her friend's home. She had been sexually assaulted and strangled. A pair of panties that did not belong to Denison were found near the body, in what police said was a ""calling card"" that helped them connect Biela not only to Denison but to the other assaults. From the witness stand in Biela's capital murder trial, one of the women recounted how she was attacked on the University of Nevada-Reno campus. She said her assailant threatened her with a gun, raped her and took her panties as a souvenir. The defense challenged the identification because she earlier told a friend she could not describe her attacker to police. The second woman, a student at the university, testified she was abducted outside her apartment and driven to a dark area and raped in the attacker's vehicle. The woman testified that her assailant asked for her panties and took them with him. The trial began with emotional testimony from Denison's mother and her boyfriend, and a video showing her with friends at a diner just a few hours before she was abducted. Denison was visiting friends in her hometown of Reno. After they attended a concert, she slept on the living room couch in a friend's off-campus apartment. While she slept, someone crept into the apartment and snatched her, police and prosecutors said. Her case triggered a flurry of national media coverage and thousands of tips, including the one that led to Biela's arrest. Police released a photo of the panties near Denison's body and a description of the pickup. A friend of Biela's girlfriend saw the photo of the panties and thought she recognized the truck police described. She told investigators that a friend's boyfriend had a truck similar to the description and that her friend had seen women's panties inside it. Detectives immediately followed up on the tip and, with permission from the girlfriend, took DNA samples from Biela's 4-year-old son. Lab tests showed that the boy's father -- Biela -- was almost certainly a match for the DNA found on the doorknob and at the crime scene, police said. DNA obtained from the other victim's rape kit matched Biela's, according to testimony. Biela's defense attorneys challenged the DNA testing method, claiming that it was not accurate. CNN's Emanuella Grinberg contributed to this report.","James Michael Biela was found guilty last week .

"(CNN) -- At least four Libyan soldiers were killed and three others wounded in violence in Benghazi on Thursday, medical and news agency sources said. The city's al-Jalaa Hospital said it received the bodies of three soldiers killed in fighting that broke out in the eastern Sidi Khalifa district. Residents reported fighting between the army and an unidentified armed group Thursday afternoon near the eastern entrance to Benghazi. Earlier Thursday, a Libyan soldier was shot dead by unknown assailants outside his home in the city's al-Sabri neighborhood, the LANA state news agency reported. On Wednesday, al-Jalaa Hospital said it received the bodies of three security force members who were shot dead in the city. The latest violence comes after fierce fighting in Benghazi on Monday between army special forces and members of the militant Islamist group Ansar al Sharia. At least nine people were killed and dozens injured in the fighting. The United States says it believes Ansar al Sharia was responsible for the attack on its diplomatic mission in Benghazi last year that killed Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three other Americans. Attacks on security force members have spiked in the eastern city in recent weeks, especially as more troops were deployed in Benghazi in an effort to secure the city. On Wednesday, the government said security cameras had arrived in the city and were being installed as part of the security plan. Over the past year, Benghazi has had some of the worst violence in Libya with a series of bombings and a campaign of assassinations that have mainly targeted security force members. Many Libyans and human rights groups blame authorities for failing to hold anyone accountable for the violence. While no one claims responsibility for these attacks, residents and security officials in the city blame Islamist militias. More than two years after the fall of the Gadhafi regime, the government is struggling to control the hundreds of militias across the country and Islamist extremist groups, some with ties to al-Qaeda, mostly in the eastern part of Libya.","Hospital says it received bodies of 3 soldiers killed in fighting in the eastern part of the city .

"(CNN) -- As the trial for two American journalists began Thursday in North Korea, a former Japanese journalist has recounted his experience while he was imprisoned in the country for about two years. ""When I was first arrested, I thought my life had ended. I was wondering how I would be killed, by public execution, by poisoning?"" Takashi Sugishima told CNN in a recent interview. International press freedom group Reporters Without Borders says the two American journalists, Laura Ling and Euna Lee, are the first foreign journalists since Sugishima to be held for any length of time in North Korea. While on his fifth visit to North Korea, Sugishima -- an economic researcher and a retired reporter for Japan's Nihon Keizai financial daily, according to the Los Angeles Times -- was seized and imprisoned in December 1999. He had been part of a delegation visiting Pyongyang, according to the Los Angeles Times. Authorities accused him of spying for Japan and South Korea, charges both nations denied, according to the newspaper. Sugishima also denies the allegation, and said he never faced trial for the charge. He said he was fearful while in prison. ""They [prison guards] would smile at me, but they could change their attitude the next second without any guilt. I tried to be as friendly as possible, but I never knew when they might decide to kill me,"" Sugishima said. Thinking he would be forced to spy for Pyongyang, he said he tried to hang himself, but an old sink broke his fall, saving him. Sugishima related his harrowing two years in prison to what Ling and Lee are possibly experiencing. ""They're likely being asked why they were there, what they filmed, what kind of report they're trying to make,"" he said. Sugishima was released in February 2002. Authorities told him it was because of pleading from Japan and his family, but at least one North Korea analyst, Shigemura Toshimitsu, said Sugishima was used as a bargaining chip to influence relations with Japan. He said he believes Pyongyang is using the same tactic with Ling and Lee to try and negotiate with Washington. Ling and Lee are reporters for California-based Current TV, the media venture of former U.S. Vice President Al Gore. The two were reporting on the plight of North Korean defectors living along the China-North Korea border when they were taken into custody March 17. Their trial began Thursday, according to U.S. State Department spokesman Ian Kelly, who cited media reports. He said the department was informed by the Swedish ambassador to North Korea that no observers are allowed in the courtroom. Analysts have said the trial could be short. The women could face years in labor camps if convicted. North Korea said the reporters had entered the country illegally. The women were accused of ""hostile acts"" and charged with spying. Contact with the women has been limited. The Swedish ambassador to North Korea was allowed to see the two journalists Monday, according to the U.S. State Department. Sweden represents the United States in North Korea because the two countries, which fought on opposite sides during the three-year Korean war in the 1950s, do not have diplomatic relations. The ambassador also met separately with the two journalists March 30 and May 15. Despite the limited communication, the families say they've heard enough to know the women are ""terrified"" and ""extremely scared."" ""While I am trying to remain hopeful, each day becomes harder and harder to bear,"" Ling wrote in the letter that her husband, Iain Clayton, read on ""Larry King Live."" ""I am so lonely and scared."" Ling's sister, CNN special correspondent Lisa Ling, made a direct on-air appeal to North Korea in an effort to win the release of her sister and Lee. ""We don't know the details of what happened on March 17th, but if at any point the girls went into North Korea, then we apologize on their behalf,"" Ling said. ""They never intended to do so."" CNN's Morgan Neill contributed to this report.","""When I was first arrested, I thought my life had ended,"" Takashi Sugishima says .

When humans blossomed from the evolutionary tree, it seems there was a cold wet nose and a wagging tail waiting for us. So it remains to this day, that we need dogs and they need us. Americans alone now spend $41 billion a year on their pets, more than the gross domestic product of all but 64 countries in the world. Quest begins his journey in Los Angeles where pampered pooches are the ultimate accessory. It's the city that caters for a dog's every whim, from spa treatments to doggy bakeries. Some mutts are not so lucky -- Quest joins actress Allison Janney at the New Leash On Life dog rescue center, where the doe-eyed inmates wait for adoption. It is here where Quest encounters Belle, a shy, docile pit bull/boxer mix with a troubled past. They say every dog has its day and on a sunny afternoon in West Hollywood, Belle has hers, as Quest takes her for a grooming and spot of shopping. Ultimately, the show is about companionship. Back in Devon, in the UK, singing sensation Joss Stone eulogizes about the fluffy members of her band -- she says that her dogs are the perfect companions because they have no idea she is a celebrity. We also join actor Richard Gere on the set of his new movie ""Hachiko"" -- the traditional Japanese story of canine loyalty. On set, we meet the dog trainers and look at the work of American Humane, authors of the phrase: ""No animals were harmed during the making of this movie."" Just like proud parents, every owner likes to think their dog is special. At the Westminster Dog Show in New York, competition gets bitchy and only the best trained hounds need apply. Back in Hollywood, Quest helps pick out the doggy stars of the future with Animal Actors agent Gloria Winship. Working dogs have left an important paw print on our society -- in Panama City, central America, we see how the specially trained dogs of the Red Cross bring comfort to sick children and prepare for rescue missions during natural disasters. Join the experts and the eccentrics for some canine capers, on this month's Quest for Man's Best Friend.

"Copiapo, Chile (CNN) -- Officials working to free 33 trapped miners in a collapsed Chilean mine said Tuesday they had cleared a drilling hole that was blocked by a shattered drill bit. Engineer Rene Aguilar said all the pieces of the broken drill bit that were in the hole drilled by the Plan B operation had been removed, and drilling could begin again soon. The Plan B drill is widening a narrow hole drilled when rescuers first searched for the miners after the mine collapsed August 5. That drill was making the fastest progress of the other rescue operations -- Plan A and Plan C -- when it hit an obstruction, possibly a reinforcement beam, at a depth of 268 meters (879 feet). ""This bit was upside down and we used a spider ... to pull it out,"" Aguilar said, holding up the ""nose"" of the bit that he said weighed about 12 kilograms (about 26 pounds). ""Spiders"" are specially designed claws that were made to pull out the broken drill pieces. A second customized bit was expected to arrive later Tuesday, and Aguilar said a camera was being lowered into the hole to check it out before drilling restarts. But a rescue crew member who is not authorized to speak to the media said workers are not certain all the pieces of the drill bit have been pulled out. ""We're not out of the woods yet, there may be some steel down there,"" the crew member said. Meanwhile, the Plan A drill -- the only drill currently operating at the mine -- reached a depth of 283 meters (928 feet) Tuesday, Aguilar said. The Plan C oil platform drill was under construction and about 70 percent finished. Drilling in that operation, which is expected to go faster than the other two, will likely begin September 20, Aguilar said. The miners are trapped in a safety chamber, 2,300 feet underground. Officials have acknowledged that it could be November before they're freed. Brandon Fisher, whose Pennsylvania-based company Center Rock Inc. is rushing the replacement bit for Plan B to the site, described what happened when the drill hit the beam. ""All of a sudden, the penetration rate stopped, the drill string torqued up violently, and we tried to pull off bottom,"" he said Monday. ""We were hung in the hole -- we worked at that for a while, and the bit passed out of that obstruction and then out of the hole. ""At that point in time, we really didn't know what the problem was until we cleared the rotary table and brought it back to surface."" A power line dropped down to the men Sunday will allow them to install electrical lights in their safety chamber, officials said. They also were granted a long-standing request for cigarettes. Officials are sending down two packs a day to be split among the miners who smoke, Chilean Mining Minister Laurence Golborne said. Cigarettes were among the first requests made by some of the miners, but they were instead supplied with nicotine patches and gum. Upgrades made to ventilation in the mine led officials to decide to allow them to smoke, Golborne said. CNN's Patrick Oppmann in Copiapo contributed to this report.","NEW: Engineer says all the pieces of the drill bit have been removed .

"Washington (CNN) -- Equal pay for women, raising the minimum wage, immigration reform, combating climate change and virtually swearing off extended wars. All are catnip for the political left, and all were highlighted by President Barack Obama this week as he informally launched the November election campaign for 36 Senate seats and a new House of Representatives. By flying the Democratic banner so high in Tuesday's State of the Union address and subsequent road show to four states, Obama tried to signal unity with his liberal base and provide the party's candidates with ammunition for elections certain to be ""spirited"" -- the Washington euphemism for fierce and nasty. ""The president wants to highlight differences between the parties and show that Democrats are on the side of ordinary people,"" said Darrell West, the vice president for governance studies at the Brookings Institution. ""That's how he won in 2012, and that's the strategy in 2014."" Focus on women, minorities . Hence the emphasis on policies that benefit women and minorities and appeal to younger voters. On Tuesday and in subsequent speeches in Maryland, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Tennessee, Obama called for equal pay for women and made sure to include references to the popular first lady. ""When women succeed America succeeds,"" he said Thursday in Waukesha, Wisconsin. ""And by the way, when women succeed, men succeed. I don't know about all the guys here, but you know when Michelle is doing good and happy, I am happy, too. I'm just sayin'."" The President also called in his State of the Union speech for raising the minimum wage from $7.25 an hour to $10.10, taking the first step himself by announcing he will unilaterally give the raise to workers under federal contracts. Republicans oppose the move in allegiance to their business supporters. According to Brown University political scientist Wendy Schiller, Obama is focusing ""on all the things that can help folks immediately, even if the impact is small."" ""Positioning the Democrats as the party of the working man and woman is old school but absolutely necessary if they are going to successfully counter the Republican resurgence among working class and independent voters, especially women,"" Schiller told CNN. Obama's 'Mad Men' remark . She cited a remark from Obama's speech Tuesday that received prolonged applause from legislators jamming the packed House chamber -- the President's call for ending unfair workplace policies for women ""that belong in a 'Mad Men' episode."" ""When both the Democratic and Republican members of Congress stood up and applauded after the famous 'Mad Men episode' quote, it was clear that each party sees women as the crucial swing factor in the 2014 elections,"" Schiller said. On the GOP side, she described the choice of Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers of Washington to deliver the party's formal response Tuesday night as ""smart politics."" Obama's re-election victory in 2012 owed much to a solid majority among women voters, including independents turned off by hardline anti-abortion policies of Republicans. The Democratic-fueled accusation of a GOP ""war on women"" gained traction with infamous missteps by Republican candidates such as former Rep. Todd Akin of Missouri, who claimed that women rarely get pregnant from ""legitimate"" rape. Akin lost his bid to unseat Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill in the Show Me State. Now a concerted Republican outreach to women voters means Democrats ""can't just count on another Todd Akin to save the Senate in 2014,"" Schiller said, adding that ""they all have to work to produce federal policies that help working families in order to sustain that advantage."" GOP must walk the talk . West said Republicans must follow stated intentions with action when it comes to diversifying their policies and supporters. ""They have to become something other than the party of angry white men,"" he said, adding the GOP also must make ""meaningful changes in public policy"" because ""they can't spin their way out of political problems by highlighting women and minorities."" While specifying issues advantageous to Democrats, Obama also has jabbed at Republicans this week on another matter that resonates with voters -- the perception that political intransigence led by tea party conservatives stymies progress in Washington. Republicans got the blame for last year's highly unpopular 16-day government shutdown when conservatives led by GOP Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas tried to link a funding measure to dismantling the 2010 health care reforms they detest. To Obama, Republicans must decide ""whether they're going to waste time creating new crises that slow things down, or whether they're going to spend time creating new jobs and opportunity,"" he said Thursday. In what he depicted as a presidential declaration of independence from congressional dysfunction, Obama said ""I want to work with them, but I can't wait for them."" Immigration reform . Another topic: reforming the immigration system, with Obama and Democrats seeking a path to legal status for the millions of people living illegally in the country. Republicans are desperate to reduce the Democratic advantage among Hispanic Americans, the nation's largest minority demographic. But House Republicans remain unlikely to support a comprehensive Senate plan that passed with bipartisan support and has Obama's backing. Instead, House Speaker John Boehner and other Republicans call for a piecemeal approach to try to show empathy with Latinos while avoiding a backlash by conservatives that would worsen an already damaging internal GOP rift. On other issues, Obama reiterated his push for unspecified action against climate change and made clear that with the Afghanistan war finally winding down, he has no intention of committing America to another prolonged engagement. ""I will not send our troops into harm's way unless it is truly necessary; nor will I allow our sons and daughters to be mired in open-ended conflicts,"" he said. ""We must fight the battles that need to be fought, not those that terrorists prefer from us."" He also refused to back down from withering criticism from the political right about the health care reforms known as Obamacare, offering a strong defense of the benefits and telling Republicans to quit trying to undermine the law. Democratic unity? Schiller said Democrats need to remain unified on Obamacare and other issues, to run as a national party as much as possible even though the November elections are at the state and district level. ""When Obamacare was brought up in the State of the Union, they all stood up and applauded, even Democratic senators who could be in trouble on the issue in their re-election races,"" she said. ""If there are any cracks in that united front for the Democrats as champions of middle class and working folks, it undermines not only their 2014 chances, but the remainder of the Obama presidential agenda."" While unity may exist in policy, some Democratic candidates facing tough elections don't want to campaign with Obama due to public opposition to Obamacare and slower-than-desired economic growth and job creation. On Thursday, Republican Gov. Scott Walker welcomed Obama to his state with an airport handshake, but Walker's Democratic challenger, Mary Burke, was nowhere to be seen. Republicans believe they can win control of the Senate by taking six seats from Democrats in November. The House is likely to remain in Republican hands, with the outcomes of 90% of the races considered safely predictable and Democrats needing to win most of the others to regain the majority, according to West. ""It's an uphill battle for Democrats to retake the House,"" he said, calling the situation ""pretty much a matter of arithmetic.""","President Obama's road show informally launches the mid-term election campaign .

"(CNN) -- The Democratic New Jersey legislator leading an investigation into Republican Gov. Chris Christie's administration says he believes laws were broken when the governor's aides ordered lane closures at the nation's busiest bridge. ""I do think laws have been broken,"" State Assemblyman John Wisniewski told CNN's Victor Blackwell and Christi Paul on Saturday. ""Public resources -- the bridge, police officers -- all were used for a political purpose, for some type of retribution, and that violates the law."" Legislators need to ""make sure any violations of law are addressed,"" said Wisniewski, who's also deputy speaker. Christie, who had no public activities scheduled for Saturday, and his spokesman couldn't be immediately reached for comment. Meanwhile, New Jersey Assembly Speaker-elect Vincent Prieto, a Democrat, will call a special session Thursday so lawmakers can vote on extending the subpoena power of the investigation led by Wisniewski, Prieto said. The past week's revelations ""clearly show the need for a continued thorough investigation by the New Jersey General Assembly,"" Prieto said. ""Many questions remain unanswered about this threat to public safety and abuse of power."" Even while Democrats call to expand the investigation, Florida Republicans confirmed Saturday that Christie will visit that state next week to raise money for the re-election effort of Gov. Rick Scott. Documents: Christie appointees stonewalled queries into lane closures . ""Yes, Christie will be here next weekend, and we are looking forward to it,"" Florida GOP spokesperson Susan Hepworth said. In New Jersey, Wisniewski said the legislative committee's investigation into the scandal ""would be made immeasurably simpler if the governor's office said, 'Please tell us what you'd like. We'll turn over all those documents.'"" ""If the governor really meant what he said, that he wants to get to the bottom of it ... it would only be fair for him to make those documents available,"" Wisniewski said. On Friday, the New Jersey State Assembly committee investigating the George Washington Bridge scandal released more than 2,000 pages of documents suggesting politics was behind the lane closures and showing top Christie aides tried to stonewall media inquiries into the matter. Read the documents . Christie, a potential presidential candidate in 2016, has strongly denied involvement in how his aides ordered the lane closures at the bridge as revenge against a neighboring Democrat mayor who refused to endorse Christie in his successful gubernatorial campaign last November. The state legislative committee has yet to find any documents indicating Christie was involved in the lane closures, Wisniewski said Saturday. But Wisniewski charged that it ""just strains believability"" that Christie had no knowledge of how his staff orchestrated the lane closures, which created public safety hazards in Fort Lee, New Jersey, where Mayor Mark Sokolich had opposed Christie's re-election effort. Wisniewski also suggested that retribution against the Fort Lee mayor was the motive behind the lane closures to the bridge, which connects New Jersey and New York, from September 9 to September 13. ""I think anything's possible,"" Wisniewski said. ""One thing's clear: The anger that was displayed [...] by people in the governor's circle after the lane closure was terminated. ""Why are they so angry? Why are they so mad at this process being shut down,"" Wisniewski asked. Plenty in his own party happy to see Christie get comeuppance . Christie this week fired his deputy chief of staff, Bridget Anne Kelly, for her role in the lane closure, which was captured in e-mail correspondence that was subpoenaed by Democrats investigating the matter. The e-mail exchanges are among the most damaging evidence so far supporting their assertions the lane closures were politically motivated. The correspondence began three weeks before access lanes to the bridge were closed. ""Time for some traffic problems in Fort Lee,"" Kelly said in an e-mail to David Wildstein, then the highest-level appointee representing the state at the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which operates the bridge connecting the two states. ""Got it,"" Wildstein replied. Wildstein resigned last month from the port authority, where he was the director of interstate capital projects. Wildstein asserted the lane closures were part of a traffic study. Legal woes lurk for Christie over scandal .

"(CNN) -- In a time when the NFL has come under scrutiny in how it punishes its players, players and fans likely will be monitoring to see how Commissioner Roger Goodell might punish one of his own bosses -- an NFL team owner. Indianapolis Colts owner Jim Irsay pleaded guilty Tuesday to one misdemeanor count of operating a vehicle while intoxicated, according to CNN affiliate WRTV. Irsay also received one year probation and will continue treatment. He will also have to pay $368.50 in court costs. It's anticipated that Goodell -- who works for the team owners -- could discipline Irsay before the start of the regular season now that the legal process is complete. The Colts are at the Denver Broncos on Sunday night. Irsay did not comment when he left the Hamilton County courthouse Tuesday. He said when arriving at the courthouse that he appreciated the love and support he's gotten and promised he'd have a statement later in the day. On March 16, Irsay was arrested and charged with operating a vehicle while intoxicated and possession of a controlled substance. At the time of the arrest, police said they found prescription drugs in pill bottles. Police said the drugs were not associated with any prescription bottles in the vehicle. According to courtroom evidence, Irsay had the painkillers oxycodone and hydrocodone in his system when he was arrested. The probable cause affidavit indicates that the Colts owner's speech was ""slow and slurred,"" his eyes were ""red and glassy"" and his balance was ""very unsteady."" He failed a number of field sobriety tests, had trouble reciting the alphabet and told an officer ""that he was having a hard time finding his house."" The following day, the Colts said in a statement that Irsay voluntarily reported to a rehabilitation facility. Irsay has previously said that he has struggled with addiction in the past. Irsay is the first National Football League owner to have faced criminal charges since Eddie DeBartolo of the San Francisco 49ers was indicted on federal racketeering charges in 1997. It remains to be seen how Goodell will handle the Irsay case. The NFL's Personal Conduct Policy states that it applies to all league personnel, including owners. The personal conduct policy also states that a first offense generally will not result in discipline until there has been a disposition of the proceeding. This is Irsay's first offense. There have been varied punishments doled out in recent NFL discipline rulings against players. Cleveland Browns wide receiver Josh Gordon has been suspended for the season for violating the league's substance abuse policy. San Francisco 49ers linebacker Aldon Smith has been suspended for nine games for violating the substance abuse and personal conduct policy. Baltimore Ravens running back Ray Rice was suspended for two games after his arrest for domestic violence against his then-fiancÃÂ©e, who is now his wife, Janay. Currently pending is the case against 49ers defensive tackle Ray McDonald, who was arrested Sunday on felony domestic violence charges. Goodell announced last week that the league was instituting a six-game unpaid ban for personnel who violate the league's policy on domestic violence. A second domestic violence incident would be punished by a lifetime ban from the league, Goodell said in a letter and memo to the owners of the league's 32 teams. The NFL had endured relentless criticism after only suspending Rice for two games, several months after video showed Rice dragging his unconscious fiancÃÂ©e from an elevator. Without referring to Rice by name, Goodell acknowledged in his letter that he made the wrong decision in that case. ""I didn't get it right. Simply put, we have to do better. And we will,"" he wrote.

"London, England (CNN) -- David Cameron spent more than four years tipped as a British prime minister-in-waiting -- a period he has called ""the longest job interview in the world."" Now the Conservative party leader finds himself the occupant of No. 10 Downing Street, the historic central London residence of UK prime ministers, after three successive election defeats for his party and more than 13 years of rule by the rival Labour Party. The Tories, as the Conservatives are also known, only took 306 of the 650 seats in the House of Commons at last week's election, falling short of the necessary majority through which to govern. Ironically Cameron -- the youngest prime minister since 1812 -- has been handed power through the formation of a coalition with Nick Clegg and the Liberal Democrats, the UK's third-biggest party, who made a strong challenge during the election campaign following the first ever televised election debates between the main party leaders. For the previous year Cameron had commanded a strong showing in the opinion polls. But who is David Cameron? His background is far from ordinary. He was educated at Eton, the UK's most exclusive fee-paying school, before joining Conservative ranks as a policy researcher after graduating from Oxford University in 1988. At Oxford he became a member of the Bullingdon Club, an elite and sometimes rowdy student dining club, whose fellow members at the time included London mayor Boris Johnson. After a foray into the world of PR -- skills some say have been put to good use in re-branding his party -- and time as a political adviser Cameron's political career really took hold in 2001 with his election as lawmaker for the Oxfordshire town of Witney in southern England. Cameron and his wife Samantha, who is creative director at luxury brand Smythson, have two young children and recently announced they are expecting another in September. But he credits the short life of his severely disabled son Ivan, who died aged six in 2009, with sharpening his political focus and making him a passionate advocate for the state-run National Health Service. ""Tony Blair once explained his priority in three words: Education, education, education. I can do it in three letters: NHS,"" Cameron said at the Conservative Party Conference in 2006. Recently on the party's Web site Cameron wrote: ""Millions of people are grateful for the care they have received from the NHS -- including my own family,"" he said. ""One of the wonderful things about living in this country is that the moment you're injured or fall ill -- no matter who you are, where you are from, or how much money you've got -- you know that the NHS will look after you."" Cameron's words were reinforced by the party's election manifesto, in which it calls itself ""the party of the NHS"" and pledges ""never to change at the idea at its heart that healthcare in this country is free at the point of use and available to everyone based on need and not ability to pay."" This attitude marks a major shift from some previous Conservative leaders. Margaret Thatcher, UK prime minister from 1979 till 1990, encouraged people to use private medical services and proposed tax breaks for private health insurance. Cameron's appeal to the Tory faithful has mostly rested in the promise that he would deliver an election victory for a party which dominated 20th century British politics but has been out of power for more than a decade. But rather than present himself as a reincarnation of Thatcher, Cameron has styled himself as a new kind of compassionate Conservative who has modernized his party -- historically a bastion of privilege, wealth and establishment values -- by softening its stance on social issues and broadening its appeal by recruiting more female and ethnic minority candidates. ""I want to tell you what I am fighting this election for -- it is the people I call the Great Ignored,"" he told supporters at one rally earlier this year. ""They may be black or white. They may be rich or poor... They are the honest, hard-working people of our country and they are desperate to know that in this great country we can still achieve great things."" Last year at a Gay Pride function, Cameron praised the then Labour government for equalizing the age of consent, introducing civil partnerships and allowing gays and lesbians to serve in the military openly. But while Cameron has played down his privileged background, he has often been attacked because of his social class. An attempt to make him the focus of the Conservatives' campaign backfired in January when billboards featuring his image were defaced and became the subject of a spoof anti-Cameron viral campaign. The Tory Party leader has also come under fire for sometimes appearing muddled and vague on his party's policies. In January he admitted that he had ""messed up"" over the party's promise to introduce tax breaks for married couples when he appeared to retreat from that pledge in an interview, forcing his press office to issue a statement reaffirming his commitment to the policy. In policy terms, Cameron has pledged to ""break up big government"" and ""take tough and difficult decisions"" -- including over the UK's $272-billion deficit.   But Cameron has often sought to distance himself from those in his party who have proposed more severe cuts, saying: ""We're not talking about swinging cuts. We're talking about making a start in reducing our deficit."" Cameron angered many in his own party last year by abandoning a ""cast-iron guarantee"" to hold a referendum, if elected, on the Lisbon Treaty -- an agreement seen by opponents of closer European Union integration as a step toward a federal super-state. That put him on a collision course with the Conservatives' notorious Euroskeptic faction which split the party the last time it was in power under John Major. In a move aimed at appeasing those critics, Cameron withdrew the Conservatives from the main center-right European People's Party, forming a controversial alliance in the European Parliament with nationalist parties from eastern Europe instead. But that seemed to risk isolating a Cameron administration from natural center-right allies in Europe such as German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Nicolas Sarkozy.   Many political observers see parallels in Cameron's youthful vigor, polished presentation skills and evasion of easy ideological pigeon-holing with Brown's Labour predecessor, Tony Blair. Cameron and Blair, writes former Labour lawmaker David Marquand in his history of modern British politics, ""share the same winsome grace, the same ability to shift affably over the rifts of interest and the same acute nose for public moods."" But Blair was swept to power on a landslide in 1997 in his first election as leader. He went on to win two further elections, seeing off four of Cameron's predecessors as Conservative leaders, although he was ultimately undermined by the Iraq war and the perception among his critics that spin doctors were exerting too much influence   Cameron's journey to 10 Downing Street has taken several detours during the past few days. As the senior partner in the UK's new coalition government, he can expect plenty more in the weeks and months ahead.

"(CNN) -- Sheikh Dr. Tahir ul-Qadri: At a news conference in London, England, on Tuesday, the renowned Islamic scholar issued a fatwa -- a religious ruling -- condemning suicide bombers as destined for hell, removing extremists' certainty of earning paradise after death. The 600-page fatwa is arguably the most comprehensive theological refutation of Islamist terrorism to date. Qadri said his aim was to set an important precedent that might allow other scholars to similarly condemn the ideas behind terrorism. London's The Independent newspaper reports that the imam told fellow Muslims: ""Terrorism is terrorism, violence is violence and it has no place in Islamic teaching and no justification can be provided for it, or any kind of excuses of ifs and buts. The world needs an absolute, unconditional, unqualified and total condemnation of terrorism."" According to his online biography, Qadri was born in Pakistan in 1951 and was raised believing that he would become a religious leader, ""since his birth had been foretold through a spiritual dream to his father."" The former law professor says he has written some 1,000 books, 360 of which are already in print. The Independent: Sheikh issues fatwa against all terrorists . Minhaj-ul-Quran: Profile of Dr. Qadri . Diane Ravitch: The influential education historian, who served as assistant secretary of education under President George H. W. Bush, ""is in the final stages of an astonishing, slow motion about-face on almost every stand she once took on American schooling,"" reports Sam Dillon in today's New York Times. He writes that Ravitch is now criticizing approaches she once supported -- standardized testing, charter schools and free markets to improve schools -- as fads that undermine public education. She is critical of No Child Left Behind legislation, saying it pushes essential subjects from classrooms. The Times reports that she addressed a meeting of school superintendents last month in Phoenix, Arizona, and pointed to the standards set by such countries as Finland and Japan. She said, ""They make sure that all their students study the arts, history, literature, geography, civics, foreign languages, the sciences and other subjects. They do this because this is the way to ensure good education. We're on the wrong track."" New York Times: Scholar's school reform U-turn shakes up debate . Jaime Escalante: The 80-year-old former Los Angeles, California, math teacher is fighting cancer, and KTLA-TV reports that his family members say they don't have the money to pay all of his medical bills. The 1988 movie ""Stand and Deliver"" tells Escalante's inspirational story: When some call his students at Garfield High School in East Los Angeles ""unteachable,"" Escalante decides to teach them calculus. When all of his students pass a national advanced placement calculus exam, the testing company questions their high scores and invalidates some of them. When Escalante protests and his students take the test again -- with one day of preparation -- they pass. True story. Actor Edward James Olmos portrayed Escalante, known affectionately as ""Kimo"" in the movie, and now he's raising money for him. On his Web site, Olmos writes, ""The genius that he awakened in the 'unteachable' commanded the attention of the entire world. It caused countless educators to reconsider what their students might really be capable of if, like Kimo, they could awaken the 'ganas' [desire] in them. Jaime didn't just teach math. Like all great teachers, he changed lives. Gang members became aerospace engineers. Kids who had spent their youth convinced their lives didn't matter discovered they were leaders.""

Nick Schuyler: On March 2, 2009, the former University of South Florida football player was rescued by the Coast Guard from his overturned boat in the Gulf of Mexico.

Some 70 miles from shore, the boat flipped over. The men tried to support and save each other.

I thought for a moment that it was weird, four grown men clustered together like puppies or kittens, but it was necessary if we were going to maintain any body heat. I could feel everybody shivering and hear their teeth chattering. Once, when it was quiet, knowing how desperate our situation was, I said, 'I love you guys.'"" All three of Schulyer's companions -- after fighting hypothermia and hallucinations -- died, but he writes that they all fought to stay alive.

So writes Folstrom in a Sports Illustrated Golf Group exclusive essay. ""This may surprise some people, but Tiger was a great boyfriend.""

"(CNN) -- There were more than 1,300 complaints of sexual harassment in the military last year, according to a Pentagon report released on Thursday. The report involving informal and formal complaints covered all of the military's major service branches and the National Guard. Of the complaints, 59% were considered substantiated, meaning that follow-up action confirmed a finding of sexual harassment. Sex harassment in the military is defined as a ""form of sex discrimination that involves unwelcome advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature"" where the victim may perceive that rejection would hurt career advancement or impact their future pay. A majority of the incidents took place on military installations, the report said. The data covered the year-long period ending last September 30. Most of those filing complaints were women from the enlisted ranks, and most of the allegations were directed at men operating in the same unit as the person claiming harassment, according to the report. Nearly half of the complaints against men were made against senior non-commissioned officers. ""We have room to improve, we have room to grow,"" a senior defense official told reporters. ""One is one too many and until we have zero, we haven't achieved success."" The findings come two weeks after a separate report released by the Pentagon showed the number of military sexual assaults had increased sharply year over year. Defense officials attributed that increase largely to stepped-up reporting practices on the part of alleged victims. Defense officials who addressed reporters on the sex harassment figures said the military would work to strengthen education, training and accountability programs. Like sexual assault, the military believes harassment is often under-reported.","The complaints covered all the major service branches and the National Guard .

"London (CNN) -- Investigators may not know what killed singer Amy Winehouse until they get results from lab tests on her blood and tissue, due in about two to four weeks, according to Scotland Yard Monday. An autopsy was completed at St. Pancras Mortuary Monday afternoon, two days after the singer died in her London apartment. ""It did not establish a formal cause of death and we await the results of further toxicology tests,"" a police statement said. An inquest into her death was opened Monday, the statement said. ""Inquiries continue into the circumstances of the death,"" London's Metropolitan Police, also known as Scotland Yard, said in a statement Sunday. At this stage, the 27-year-old's death ""is being treated as unexplained and there have been no arrests in connection with the incident,"" police said. The singer, beloved for her talent but infamous for erratic public behavior, arrests and drug problems, was found dead at her apartment in London on Saturday. Winehouse's family said in a statement Sunday it ""has been left bereft by the loss of Amy, a wonderful daughter, sister, niece. She leaves a gaping hole in our lives. We are coming together to remember her and we would appreciate some privacy and space at this terrible time."" ""We are trying to come to terms with the death of a dear friend and colleague, the most amazing artist and talent,"" her management company, Metropolis Music, said Sunday. ""We will always remember Amy as a vibrant, funny, caring young woman who made everyone around her feel welcome. We have lost a very special person, part of our family."" Her funeral will be held Tuesday, the singer's spokesman Chris Goodman said. Sparse details are being released about the ceremony -- including exactly when and where it will occur -- though Goodman said ""it will be a small, private event for a few friends and family."" Winehouse's soulful, throaty vocals brought the British musician stardom in 2007, but her troubled off-stage life -- chronicled in her Top 10 hit ""Rehab"" -- won her notoriety. Her death came less than two months after her latest release from a rehabilitation program and weeks after she was booed offstage by disappointed fans in Belgrade, Serbia. Winehouse died at the same age as at least four other recent music legends. Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin and Jim Morrison each died of drug overdoses when they were 27. Kurt Cobain was 27 when he committed suicide, soon after his release from rehab. Police were called to Winehouse's Camden Square apartment just after 4 p.m. Saturday in response to a report of ""a woman found deceased,"" authorities said. ""Everyone who is involved with Amy is shocked and devastated,"" Winehouse spokesman Chris Goodman said. ""Our thoughts are with her family and friends."" Her father, Mitch, got word of his daughter's death Saturday while in New York preparing for a Monday night show with his band at the Blue Note club, his publicist said. He immediately canceled the performance and caught a flight back to London, the publicist said. Winehouse's official website carried nothing but a black-and-white photo of the singer. On Saturday, a statement on the site said Winehouse was ""withdrawing from all scheduled performances."" Her song ""Rehab,"" in which she sang ""They tried to make me go to rehab, I said no, no, no,"" helped form the public's view of Winehouse. She told CNN in a 2007 interview, ""I don't care enough about what people think of me to conform to anything."" The London-born singer was a tattooed teenage rebel after she was expelled from a prestigious performing arts school. Her first album, ""Frank,"" debuted in 2003, when the singer-songwriter was 19. International success came with her 2007 album ""Back to Black."" She dominated the 2008 Grammys, winning five awards that night and delivering, via satellite from London, a strong performance of ""Rehab."" Winehouse's volatile marriage to Blake Fielder-Civil took a toll on the singer's career. The couple divorced in 2009 after a stormy two years filled by drug addiction and arrests. Winehouse's parents went public with their efforts to help their daughter, telling the London Telegraph in 2009 that she was on the road to recovery. ""A gradual recovery, which is good,"" Winehouse's father told the Telegraph. ""With slight backward steps -- not drug backward steps, more drink backward steps if you follow my drift. I think that will be the pattern of recovery."" The organization that awards the Grammys issued a statement Saturday calling Winehouse ""a dynamic performer and musician who seamlessly blended rock, jazz, pop, and soul and created a sound all her own."" ""Her rich, soulful and unique voice reflected her honest songwriting and earned her a devoted fan following, critical acclaim, and the genuine respect and admiration of her musical peers,"" the Recording Academy statement said. ""She will forever be remembered for her immense talent, and her music will live on for generations to come. Our deepest sympathies go out to her family, friends, and fans during this difficult time.""

"Washington (CNN) -- It was a crowning achievement, but he wasn't sure that he wanted to be there. He wasn't sure he could make it through the speech without running out of the House chamber in panic. And he didn't know how many of his country's leaders cared. Matt Cooke wore his camouflage combat uniform, surrounded by lawmakers, innovators and a few celebrities, and he stepped into a room that would hold the world's greatest concentration of power per square inch for an hour or so. But the everyday hero just wanted to get through the State of the Union on Tuesday night. His seat was next to the door, just in case. The much-coveted invitation came because of his heroism on November 5, 2009, when he stopped by the Soldier Readiness Processing Center at the sprawling Army base at Fort Hood, Texas. Moments after military psychiatrist Nidal Hasan opened fire, Cooke threw himself on top of another soldier, likely saving that man's life but taking five bullets himself. His wounds still affect him. His eyesight may deteriorate for the rest of his life. But as Cooke looked out from the House chamber balcony Tuesday night, the biggest potential issues were his mind and fears. ""I don't like being by myself,"" he said earlier before the event, pausing. ""I don't trust, it's hard for me to trust people now."" Cooke was honored to be at the Capitol, of course. But logistics dictated that the shy, blue-eyed veteran had to sit with strangers. (Each member of Congress got one ticket.) And he didn't like that. Cooke needs to be around people he knows. And after he survived the massacre in the middle of a U.S. Army base, he has a hard time trusting security anywhere. The increased measures at the Capitol actually added to those concerns, raising the idea that this place was especially threatened. But the unassuming man came anyway, battling his post-traumatic stress disorder-instincts out of gratitude to his hometown congressman, Republican Robert Pittenger of North Carolina, and to push for what he believes is long overdue recognition for the victims of Fort Hood. ""The Department of Defense says it was workplace violence,"" Cooke relayed hours before the State of the Union, sitting on a window bench tucked into a House office building stairway. ""It was a terrorist act ... to me, it seems they're trying to cover it up, almost as if it never happened the way it did."" There are multiple issues here. Under the ""workplace violence"" designation, benefits are lower than if the attack were considered terrorism or part of an active conflict. Victims and families face lower disabled income or death benefits. Thirteen people were killed at Fort Hood. A softer Republican side in response to Obama . Cooke spoke with determination on this. ""It's not about the money for me. It has nothing to do with the money,"" he said. He wants the families to be recognized, for victims to be able to receive purple hearts for their wounds and be afforded all honors appropriate to that at a military burial. But Cooke and his family believe the vast majority of Americans don't know about their continued battle. And that Congress is happy to move on. ""There is a bill, H.R. 3111, to declare Fort Hood a terrorist act, but Congress ...,"" he shakes his head. ""September Eleventh at the Pentagon was a terrorist attack, but this, no."" Hasan was convicted last August in a military court of murder and attempted murder. A jury recommended a death sentence. Thirteen people were killed at Fort Hood. A U.S.-born citizen of Palestinian descent who was preparing to deploy to Afghanistan, Hasan admitted to targeting soldiers. He said at one point that he wanted to protect the Taliban and its leaders from the U.S. military. Comprehensive coverage: State of the Union . Investigations after the massacre found he had been communicating via e-mail with Anwar al-Awlaki, an Yemeni-American radical cleric killed by a U.S. drone attack in 2011. Cooke's foot taps as he talks about it, but otherwise his bearing was deeply calm. Almost tired. His injuries rewrote his life. A marriage failed. He is no longer allowed to drive. And he lives with his mom, Diane Frappier, and stepdad, Jerry Frappier. The couple sometimes can't get the 34-year-old to leave his room. ""Before (coming to Washington), he spent three days in his bedroom,"" Diane Frappier confided. ""He was really nervous."" That bedroom is a safe place, he thinks. The Capitol is not. To help, Diane and Jerry made the road trip with their son. They stood next to him during interviews. Walked beside him down Capitol Hill's hard marble hallways. For Diane, the trip is a part of her son's recovery and his mission now. ""I think it's time for some of his story to come out,"" said Diane, who is as feisty and confident as her son is humble and careful. This is the first time Matt Cooke has ever heard a State of the Union address. But frankly the speech was not his main interest. He was at the Capitol to represent people who served the military, suffered at the hands of a gunman and who now feel overlooked. When asked what he hopes for himself, the 13-year veteran gave an answer of recovery. ""I don't know. Right now, I'm hoping for today,"" he said. And, it turns out, the day was good. In the teeming House chamber, Cooke saw the unexpected -- the face of fellow Fort Hood survivor Alonzo Lunsford, just a few seats away. Cooke knew his friend was in town, but not where he'd be during the speech. The room felt better. He made it. He didn't need to run. And he could listen as the President and Congress honored another surviving soldier -- Sgt. Cory Remsburg. High up in the balcony, off camera, Matt Cooke soaked in the wave of cheers. ""It was a pretty good night,"" he said.","Veteran Matt Cooke, a survivor of the Fort Hood massacre, attends State of the Union .

"(CNN) -- A senior Army officer has been suspended for his alleged mishandling of suspected sexual abuse, an issue that has dogged the U.S. military. The officer affected is Maj. Gen. Michael T. Harrison, until now the commander of U.S. Army forces in Japan. ""He was suspended due to allegations he failed to properly report and investigate allegations of sexual abuse,"" Army spokesman George Wright told CNN on Friday. Wright didn't offer more details, beyond saying that there are no allegations that Harrison himself is guilty of personal misconduct. In a press release, the U.S. Department of Defense said that the action was taken by Army Secretary John McHugh and Army Chief of Staff Ray Odierno. Maj. Gen. James C. Boozer, the former deputy commanding general of the U.S. Army Europe, will step in to lead U.S. forces in Japan ""until the investigation is complete and the issue resolved,"" the Pentagon said. The U.S. military has been hit hard over the issue of sexual assault in its ranks. Military chiefs oppose removing commanders from sexual assault investigations . The Defense Department earlier this spring reported an estimated 26,000 cases of unwanted sexual contact -- ranging from rape to groping -- in 2012. That was a 35% jump from 2010, the Defense Department said. The report prompted President Barack Obama, during May 24 commencement exercises at the Naval Academy, to tell graduates, ""Those who commit sexual assault are not only committing a crime, they threaten the trust and discipline that makes our military strong."" A number of specific cases have made headlines as well, prompting criticism from within and outside the military. Among them: . -- An Army sergeant first class assigned to the sexual assault prevention unit at Fort Hood, Texas, is being investigated for alleged sexual assault, pandering, abusive sexual contact and maltreatment of subordinates. -- In early May, an Air Force officer who worked with an assault prevention unit was charged with sexual battery after being accused of grabbing a woman and groping her buttocks and breasts in a parking lot not far from his Washington office. -- Three U.S. Naval Academy football players are under investigation in an alleged sex assault involving a female midshipman at an off-campus ""football house"" party in April 2012, according to a Defense Department official. The victim says she learned from friends and social media that the players claimed to have had sexual intercourse with her while she was intoxicated, her lawyer said. Harrison joined the U.S. Army in 1980, and since then he has served in numerous capacities throughout that military branch and around the world. That includes leadership roles with the 10th Mountain Division and the Combined Security Transition Command-Afghanistan. He rose to his post as commanding general of U.S. forces in Japan and of I Corps (Forward) in October 2010, according to his Army bio.","Commander of U.S. Army forces in Japan is suspended, the military says .

"(CNN) -- Federal prosecutors revealed a photograph Thursday that they say show an Amish man attacking another Amish man by attempting to forcibly cut his beard. The photo was submitted as evidence in the trial of 16 Amish men and women charged with federal hate crimes in connection with last year's beard-cutting attacks in rural eastern Ohio. The trial started Monday at federal court in Cleveland with jury selection. To the Amish, a beard is a significant symbol of faith and manhood. The photo was recovered from a disposable camera that was used to document the attacks, which prosecutors say were ordered by Samuel Mullet Sr., the Amish leader of a breakaway sect and one of the 16 defendants. Prosecutors did not identify the attacker or the victim in the photo in their court filings. If convicted, Mullet faces 20 years in prison, according to CNN affiliate WOIO in Cleveland. According to witnesses cited in a federal affidavit, Mullet ""forced extreme punishments"" on anyone in his community who defied him, ""including forcing members to sleep for days at a time in a chicken coop on his property."" In addition, the affidavit alleges that, as the bishop of his Amish clan in Bergholz, Ohio, Mullet had ""acts of sexual intimacy"" with married women as part of ""counseling"" to ""cleanse them of the devil."" CNN has sought a response from Mullet's attorney, Edward Bryan. Bryan has disputed the prosecution's characterization of his client, according to The Cleveland Plain Dealer. ""They're trying to create this perception he's something he's not,"" Bryan told the newspaper. ""He's not a wacky cult leader. He's a decent, hardworking, caring man."" Usually, the Amish resolve disputes without involving law enforcement, but concerns that Mullet is operating a cult on his compound prompted some to report the beard-cutting incidents to police last fall. Myron Miller was held down by men armed with scissors and battery-powered clippers who cut off a chunk of his beard, according to a police report. Arlene Miller said she and her husband decided to report the cutting to police in hopes of preventing other people from being hurt, including Mullet's followers, who ""need help,"" she said. ""There's a lot of lives being messed up down there. There's a lot of people being abused and brainwashed,"" Arlene Miller said. The Millers said that a fear of reprisal attacks prompted them and other Amish residents in rural eastern Ohio to lock their doors at night -- something unheard-of in Amish communities. Mullet's sect is made up primarily of his relatives living on and around an 800-acre compound in a remote valley outside Bergholz, according to Jefferson County Sheriff Fred Abdalla. Prosecutors have said Mullet ""exerted control over the Bergholz community by taking the wives of other men into his home and by overseeing various means of disciplining community members, including corporal punishment."" Those accusations could play a key part in the trial against Mullet and his co-defendants. Last week, a federal judge ruled that witnesses can testify about Mullet's alleged sexual activities at his compound in Bergholz, according to The Plain Dealer. When reports of the beard-cutting attacks surfaced last fall, they uncovered an ongoing split between Mullet's sect and the larger Amish community in and around Bergholz, many of whom believe that Mullet is creating rules and punishments that do not fit with the broader Amish belief system. Aden Troyer said he was once part of the Mullet family compound. He married Mullet's daughter, Wilma, and the couple had two daughters. Concerned about the way Mullet was ""ruling"" his followers, Troyer said, he started making arrangements to move his wife and children out of the group. Not long after, Troyer said, Mullet began interfering with their marriage. Troyer said Mullet would ask women, including his wife, ""about their sexual relationships with their husbands."" ""That's very atypical behavior for Amish to do that,"" Troyer said. ""It's unheard-of. ""In the Amish community, no one has jurisdiction over what goes on between a husband and wife,"" he said. ""He's the only guy and only leader that I know of that ever has gotten into an Amish couple's married life."" Troyer divorced and left the sect in 2007 with full custody of his two daughters. CNN traveled to Mullet's compound last fall before his arrest, and Mullet denied that he was running a cult. When asked about allegations that he orchestrated the beard-cutting attacks, he responded, ""Beard-cutting is a crime, is it?"" Asked about the accusation that he split up his daughter's marriage to Troyer, Mullet responded, ""Maybe you should ask the people whose beards were cut about the marriages they've split up."" He refused to elaborate. Abdalla, the sheriff, said last fall that he fears the situation could come to a dramatic conclusion. ""If I were to get a call right now telling me, 'Sheriff, they're all dead in the community out there,' it wouldn't surprise me,' "" he said. CNN goes inside the Mullet compound .

"CHICAGO, Illinois (CNN) -- U.S. Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr. said Friday that he was fighting to get ""my name back"" after he was identified as ""Senate Candidate 5"" in a criminal complaint against Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich. Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr. says neither he nor any emissaries offered favors in exchange for a Senate appointment. Jackson, the son of famed civil rights leader Jesse Jackson and a six-term Democratic congressman from Chicago, had publicly sought to succeed President-elect Barack Obama in the U.S. Senate. Jackson had talked to Blagojevich, the person with the sole power to make the appointment, on Monday, just one day before federal agents arrested the Illinois governor. Jackson said he only presented his credentials and polling information that suggests he could win re-election in 2010. Jackson said he had fought corruption ""since day one"" but said he could not serve as Illinois senator until his name was cleared in the public eye. ""While I would be honored to serve the people of this state, it is clear to me that I am in no capacity to serve them if there is a cloud over my head that seems to suggest that I am involved in some unscrupulous scheme to be a United States senator or anything else,"" Jackson told CNN's Don Lemon. Prosecutors accuse Blagojevich of selling the Senate seat in exchange for campaign contributions and other favors. However, they did not accuse Jackson or any of the other candidates referred to in the complaint of wrongdoing. Jackson denied participating in the ""pay to play"" politics that Blagojevich is accused of in a federal criminal complaint. Jackson also said he was eager to talk to U.S. Attorney Patrick Fitzgerald about his role. ""When it's over, I want everyone to know that I want my name back. ... I'm fighting now for my character, and I'm also fighting for my life,"" he said. ""This is about my children being able to Google their name in five years and there be nothing there associated with them that suggests anything wrong.""  Watch Jackson say he wants his name back Â» . Jackson said he does not understand why Blagojevich believed he would trade favors in exchange for an appointment to the Senate, saying he had ""nothing to offer but my record of public service."" He also said he did not send an emissary -- including his father or his brother, Jonathan -- to Blagojevich offering favors. ""When the facts become clear ... I think the American people will recognize that the governor of our state is a little different,"" he said.  Watch Jackson question the governor's mental capacity Â» . Jackson said it is wrong for politicians to believe they can gain personally as a result of holding public office. ""I think that there is a disconnect between public service and private sacrifice. ... If for one moment you think that public service is also private gain, then you are trampling on very, very unsteady ground that is likely to force you and good people with good names in a very different process,"" he said.

"(CNN) -- The San Diego City Council voted Tuesday to deny Mayor Bob Filner's request for taxpayers to pay his legal fees associated with a sexual harassment lawsuit against him, a spokesman said. The vote was 9-0, according to Matt Awbrey, spokesman for City Council member Kevin Faulconer. The city is named as a co-defendant in the lawsuit against Filner. His former spokeswoman filed the suit alleging both were responsible for the mayor's sexual harassment. San Diego says it shouldn't be part of the lawsuit in the first place because it had no role in the mayor's behavior and because it has a zero-tolerance policy against sexual harassment. The city ""believes that it neither caused nor contributed to the damages alleged by"" Filner's former spokeswoman, Irene Jackson. Amid calls for resignation, embattled mayor to enter clinic . It's a complicated situation. Jackson and seven other women say they were subjected to ""crude and disgusting"" comments and inappropriate touching -- including groping and kissing -- by Filner, and she resigned as his spokeswoman in June. Eight days ago, Jackson filed suit against both Filner and the city, alleging both were responsible. Filner, 70, then sent a letter to the city, saying it should mount his defense and pay his legal bills. Opinion: No room for lecherous mayors . The San Diego City Council met earlier Tuesday and unanimously decided to file suit against Filner, saying it is the mayor who should pay the city's legal bills in defending the case. And if Jackson wins her case, the city's lawsuit seeks indemnity from paying any damages. ""Bob Filner can't pay back San Diegans for the damage he's done to our city's reputation, but he can and should repay the city if there are any taxpayer costs as a result of this lawsuit,"" Faulconer said in a statement. San Diego mayor sued, called unfit for office . Filner says he will enter a behavior counseling clinic next month for two weeks of ""intensive therapy,"" but he has repeatedly said he won't step down. His decision is unlikely to quell the mounting calls for his resignation. Many of the accusations allegedly took place during Filner's five terms in Congress, before he was elected mayor last year. In response, Filner's chief of staff resigned, the Democratic Party of San Diego voted to call for his resignation -- even his fiancee left his side. A group began an official recall effort, but political observers have expressed doubt that the group can logistically pull off collecting the more than 100,000 signatures needed.

"(CNN) -- Rescuers faced delays during medical emergencies because of traffic jams that appear to be tied to a political scandal engulfing former appointees of New Jersey Gov.

Ambulances and paramedics in Fort Lee, New Jersey, got stuck in gridlock caused by a ""new traffic pattern"" on the George Washington Bridge in September, EMS Coordinator Paul E. Favia wrote in a letter to the town's mayor. It's the latest twist in a political controversy that erupted Wednesday, when e-mails surfaced implying that members of Christie's staff had deliberately orchestrated lane closures that caused heavy traffic backups on the nation's busiest bridge as political punishment for Fort Lee Mayor Mark Sokolich, who did not back the New Jersey governor's re-election.

Favia's letter -- dated September 10, 2013 -- suggests that what started as a local political fight could have had real life-or-death consequences. In the letter, which does not mention Christie or his administration, Favia said a police officer had told him traffic snarls in Fort Lee were caused by ""a new traffic pattern at the (bridge's) toll booths."" Opinion: Christie's rising star now a target . ""I would like to bring this to your attention as this new traffic pattern is causing unnecessary delays for emergency services to arrive on scene for medical emergencies within the borough,"" he wrote. Favia asked for the mayor's help in changing the traffic pattern to avoid delayed response times. He listed several examples of delays, including car wrecks, chest pains and a 91-year-old who suffered a heart attack. Christie says he was misled over bridge firestorm . In one instance, the EMS director said he was forced to jump a curb to escape traffic that was at a standstill while he was responding to a car accident with multiple injuries. Trips that should have taken just a few minutes took up to three times longer, he wrote. Christie said in a statement Wednesday that ""what I've seen today is unacceptable,"" adding that he was ""misled by a member of his staff"" and knew nothing about what had transpired. He previously said he knew nothing about allegations of political retribution. His administration earlier had blamed the lane closures and traffic mess on a mishandled traffic study.

"(CNN) -- The energy generated by the January 13 earthquake in Haiti was larger than that of the Hiroshima atomic bomb. While many people were surprised to learn that Haiti is vulnerable to earthquakes because the last major earthquakes there were in 1761, 1770 and 1860, experts should have been taken that quiet period as an ominous sign. A catastrophic amount of energy had been building up all that time, culminating in a 7.0 quake and many aftershocks that ruptured a segment of the fault 40 kilometers (24.85 miles) long. It affected an area roughly 100 km (62.14 miles) to the north and south, well beyond the capital of Port-au-Prince. It may take a decade for Haiti to rebuild. This time, let's make sure the construction accounts for our acute awareness that earthquakes can happen in the Caribbean. The question in many people's minds is why has the destruction been so catastrophic? There are several reasons for the widespread damage to buildings, bridges and other infrastructure. The most obvious is the sheer magnitude of the event and its proximity to the densely populated capital and surrounding towns. The epicenter was about 15 km (9.32 miles) from Port-au-Prince. The earthquake generated very large vibrations. Based on witness accounts, the shaking lasted as much as a minute. So far, no instrument data have been obtained from the region to confirm these accounts. No human being, of course, could control the quake. But people can learn from the second reason why the destruction was so severe: the apparent lack of any seismic design requirements for buildings. Most of the construction appears to be reinforced concrete frame but with little seismic reinforcement. Review of the photos of some of the collapsed multistory structures shows very slender columns supporting heavy concrete slabs. A closer look at these photos shows that the amount of steel reinforcement in many cases was minimal, if it was present at all. This type of construction is consistent with areas that are not earthquake-prone, where the structure is expected to carry only vertical loads such as those due to the weight of the building material. But earthquakes shake structures in two horizontal directions similar to a swinging motion, and with the slim columns and little reinforcement, the columns crumbled. They lacked the strength and ability to bend without breaking. Higher-strength columns would have been needed to resist the earthquake forces, but they also would have to have been connected properly to the beams or floor slabs with additional steel bars running from the columns into the beams in order to provide continuous transfer of the forces from one structural element to another. It is likely that even a weaker earthquake could have caused many of the buildings in Haiti to suffer severe damage. Infrastructure is more than just buildings, and there are equal concerns about Haiti's power and water systems. Power is out, indicating that power lines are down, but we do not know much yet about how power generation and transformer stations fared. An even greater concern is the potential failure of the water and sewer system. It is very likely that underground water and sewer systems have been damaged, leading to potential contamination of the drinking water. Certainly extensive damage to these utility systems, in addition to posing a potential health threat in the short term, will add to the time and expense of rebuilding in the long term. What it would take to rebuild the country is probably a question that has not been addressed yet by either local Haitian officials or by international bodies, but it will need to be confronted soon. Because Haiti is a very poor country, funding will be essential. Fortunately, it seems likely that the international community will come up with the financial resources to help.. But before reconstruction of the civil infrastructure can even begin, it will be necessary to have a stable and functioning government that will provide the support and oversight of such an effort. To prevent future disasters, the country needs to develop, or at the very least adopt, a seismic building code from other earthquake-prone regions. Adopting the seismic components of the International Building Code would be a good place to start. Sure, measures such as adding lateral reinforcement to columns and adding steel reinforcements at joints between beams and columns to transfer forces will be more expensive, but they are clearly necessary. Adopting a seismic code by itself, however, does not solve the problem and all the money in the world can't make reconstruction happen immediately. Local engineers and planners need to be trained in proper design and construction practices, and most importantly, there has to be a regulatory body that oversees the implementation of such codes. The country should develop its own seismic hazard map that would identify the severity of ground shaking, and areas where conditions make damage and landslides potentially most severe. If Haiti and helpful nations around the world respond correctly to this tragedy, perhaps it will never be repeated. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Anne Kiremidjian.","Anne Kiremidjian: Energy released was equivalent of atomic bomb in Hiroshima .

"(Mashable) -- Microsoft received much Twitter flak after a small PR account for its Xbox system encouraged followers to remember recently deceased musician Amy Winehouse by purchasing her last album on the company's entertainment marketplace, Zune.

"(CNN) -- I promised myself that I wouldn't do it. I wasn't going to jump in to the whole Miley Cyrus circus. No siree. The pond was full. The seats were all taken. Social media was in overdrive. And everyone's been far too distracted. I, for one, was not about to enter the twerkosphere. But dang, it's like a train wreck, isn't it? Candidly, I haven't been all that bad. Honest. But I have kept up to speed on many of the conversations taking place. Shame on Miley. Shame on her parents. Shame on MTV. Shame on censors. Shame on people who are shaming people. Shame, shame, shame. But the one person who seems to have flown under the shame radar is Miley's partner in debauchery, Robin Thicke. As a dad and husband in this story, it seems to me he should be held as accountable -- if not more -- for this ridiculous national spectacle and its aftermath as a 20-year-old girl. Let's rewind: I actually saw the performance. Our television -- which is usually on ESPN -- was uncharacteristically tuned to MTV the other night so my 17-year-old son and I could watch what we heard was going to be a pretty awesome Justin Timberlake performance. Well, we enjoyed the JT treat. And, yup, we also got more of Miley than we bargained for. Outraged parents: Why Miley Cyrus' performance sets girls and women back . Sure, from my middle-aged vantage point, it was gross, inappropriate, and downright offensive. But let's be honest, so much of what our kids are exposed to is just that. Everywhere. And if you think otherwise, take an inventory of advertising, television shows, music lyrics, teen magazines, social media and virtually everything associated with the Internet. I'm not condoning or supporting it. But I do accept it as a reality. I've also come to believe there are gray areas -- or to use Miley's performing partner, Robin Thicke's words, blurred lines -- in life. Especially when we're tempted to pass judgment on others. There's especially a lot of those fuzzy areas with kids as they navigate their way to adulthood. Maybe that's why I'm more forgiving and understanding of Miley than others. She's 20. In my book, that still makes her a kid. I have two of my own around her age. To me, she's just one of the gang. Miley Cyrus upholds MTV VMAs tradition . I've spent a lot of time around teens and young adults in my life. And many of them make crazy mistakes along the way. They say ignorant things. They do things that they'll regret. But, as best as I can tell, they usually turn out fine. My kids were glued to Miley's Hannah Montana years and I think she's one incredibly talented person. Even some of her new stuff is fine. Is she going overboard with this apparent mission to prove she's an adult? Seems so. But who I am to judge? As a dad, I can only hope she finds her way through her own blurred lines and gets to the other side healthy. And a little wiser. But I do believe there are other places in life where the lines are black and white. Just like the stripes on Mr. Thicke's fun costume the other night. And, truthfully, I think he's the one that crossed a line. A big thick one. It's the line that says while we can have fun, men must know the difference between respect and disrespect when it comes to how we treat women. I find it ironic that so many people talk about how Miley will look back on all this with embarrassment in the future. I don't know if that will ever happen. And I don't know that I care. If Miley Cyrus outrages you, don't watch . But I do care that Mr. Thicke (who I also think is an awesome artist) seems to have abdicated his responsibility (as a man -- not a celebrity) to model respectable behavior towards women. He's 36. He's a dad. And I'm guessing he's a pretty dandy dad and husband. I mean, come on, his own father was Jason Seaver of ""Growing Pains""! I'm not an MTV producer, but I'm pretty confident Mr. Thicke knew exactly how that performance was going to go down. Foam fingers, package grabbing, twerking, Miley backing herself into his hips like he was an open garage door, and the rest of the mess. He's a man. He's a dad. Just like the rest of us. And we all owe it to our kids to act and show them where the blurred lines go away. And a special note to my 17-year-old son: I know we both rolled our eyes the other night when we watched Miley. It was pretty awkward to see her act that way. We all do dumb things and I hope you know I'll always give you plenty of room to make mistakes and find your way to adulthood. As you can guess, I'd appreciate it if you kept from anything involving twerking on national television. And please limit your use of foam fingers to sporting events. But if I ever see or hear of you crossing that very real line about how to treat a woman -- or any human being for that matter -- don't expect such open-mindedness from me. There's no such thing as a blurred line when it comes to respect. As your dad, I take that one very seriously.","Miley Cyrus bore the brunt of public outcry after a salacious VMA performance .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The Bush administration cleared the way Thursday for federal agencies to skip consultations with government scientists when embarking on projects that could impact endangered wildlife, the interior secretary said. Environmentalists are not happy with President Bush's changes to regulations of the Endangered Species Act. The final regulations to the Endangered Species Act take effect before President Bush leaves office in January, but wildlife conservation groups say undoing the damage could take months. ""The responsibility to initiate consultation will still lie with the federal agency undertaking the action,"" Interior Secretary Dirk Kempthorne said, but if the agency in question can satisfy the requirement that no harm will come to an endangered species, then there is no need to consult with either the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service or the National Marine Fisheries Services. The determination of ""no harm"" will rest with agency bureaucrats instead of scientists, but the agencies can still seek the input of the scientists on a voluntary basis, Kempthorne said. Developers and agencies with large projects have long sought a weakening of Endangered Species Act regulations, which they say delay their projects and add to costs. Environmental groups contend that this change will take scientists and biologists who have protected endangered species completely out of the mix, leaving wildlife more vulnerable and harder to protect. They also say that more than 250,000 citizens voiced their opposition to the measure through the Web site regulations.gov. ""The Department of Interior is ignoring the vast majority of the over 200,000 comments they got on this rule change-by moving forward. They are basically saying public be damned,"" said Andrew Wetzler, Director of the Natural Resources Defense Council's Endangered Species program. The NRDC maintains that ""absent court action, undoing this ruling could take months ... despite today's feel-good statements, we remain convinced that these changes are illegal."" The National Wildlife Federation, also voicing strong opposition, said that ""in the eleventh hour of his presidency, President Bush has rammed through a sweeping overhaul of the Endangered Species Act. This action eviscerates key protections that have helped safeguard and recover endangered fish, wildlife and plants for the past 35 years.' But Chris Paolino, a spokesman for the Interior Department, said that the change is an ""attempt to refocus the resources, time and manpower of both the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Federation and National Marine Fisheries to focus on those projects that have a measurable, adverse impact on endangered species."" President-elect Barack Obama has said he would work to reverse the changes, but since they go into effect before he takes office, his administration would have to reopen the rulemaking process. Congress could also act to block the new regulations.","Bush administration changes regulations of Endangered Species Act .

"(CNN) -- An arrest in which several punches were thrown has triggered an accusation of brutality against Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, police from the mother of the 18-year-old honor student who was taken into custody. Police, in a criminal complaint on the incident, say ""closed fist strikes"" were used by the undercover police officers, but only to subdue the teenager as he tried to get away. His mother said she plans to file a civil rights claim against the officers. Terez Miles said her son, Jordan Miles, who is black, thought his life was in jeopardy when three white men jumped out of a car on the night of January 11 as he walked not far from his home. ""My son tried to run thinking his life was in jeopardy,"" Terez Miles said. ""He made three steps before he slipped and fell."" After that, she said, the police used a stun gun and beat him, pulling out a chunk of his hair. The criminal complaint says the officers, considering Jordan Miles' appearance suspicious, got out of the car and identified themselves as police. He tried to flee, fell, and then struggled to escape. The officers ""delivered 2-3 closed fist strikes to Miles' head/face with still no effect,"" and then a ""knee strike to Miles' head causing him to momentarily stop resisting,"" so that he could be handcuffed, the document says. Miles' mother said the officers did not identify themselves as police to her son, a viola player and student at the city's Creative and Performing Arts High School. The complaint says the police officers believed Miles was engaged in criminal activity and possibly armed with a ""large heavy object."" The object turned out to be a bottle of Mountain Dew. Miles was charged with aggravated assault, loitering, resisting arrest and escape. A hearing in the case was scheduled for Thursday, but it was unclear whether the officers involved showed up, said Miles' attorney, Kerry Lewis. The judge postponed the case until February 18. Pittsburgh Mayor Luke Ravenstahl is ""taking this very seriously,"" said his press secretary, Joanna Doven. ""The case is being investigated, he's closely monitoring it. He's met with the chief."" The three officers were taken off plainclothes duty and were back in uniform, she said. Terez Miles contends the officers used too much force. ""My son is 150 pounds and 5-foot-6. There's no need for this degree of violence and brutality for someone of this stature,"" she said.

The singer's father is a guest on Tuesday's ""Piers Morgan Tonight."" Amy Winehouse, 27, was found dead at her apartment on July 23. ""I was holding one of the babies,"" Winehouse said. ""And my cousin is English, and he phoned his dad to say that I was there, and I spoke to my uncle. And he said to me, 'How's Amy?' And I said, 'She's doing great.' And as I was talking with him, my mobile rang. I picked up the phone, and it was Amy's security guard, and he was crying, and he told me that she'd passed away.""

""Her mum, Janis, and Richard, Janis' boyfriend, went to see her earlier in the day, and she was in good spirits."" Winehouse went on to explain that Amy was singing and playing the drums in her room until about 1 a.m. The chart-topping five-time Grammy winner was in her London home at the time. Her security guard suggested that she stop playing because the neighbors might complain. ""She says, 'Yes, no problem,' "" Winehouse said. ""And she stopped playing the drum, and he heard her walking around for another half an hour or so, and he thought she'd gone to sleep. He checked on her at about 3 in the morning, and she seemed to be asleep."" The guard checked on Amy again around 8 a.m. ""He saw that there was a problem, and they called the paramedics, and that was it,"" said Winehouse, who heard the news at 11 a.m. New York time. Morgan asked Winehouse to recall his immediate reaction. ""I had incredible clarity,"" he said. ""And I wasn't crying, I wasn't screaming. In fact, I was holding one of the babies, and I gave the baby to my cousin, and I was comforting the security guard, who -- he blamed himself. There was nothing to blame himself for. And I was comforting him, and I was comforting my cousin, I was comforting my uncle. And I was obviously in shock."" Was a part of Winehouse expecting that he'd one day get that dreaded call, given his daughter's drug- and alcohol-fueled past? ""No, not at all,"" he said. ""Had this had happened three or four years previously, to be honest with you, I'd have held my hands up and I would've said, 'Fair enough.' "" Winehouse said that his daughter hadn't used drugs for the past three years. Alcohol, however, was a different issue. ""Unfortunately, the alcohol, as you may be aware, one addiction can follow another, and this is what happened with Amy."" Winehouse also said that his daughter took on another addiction, albeit a positive one -- fitness. ""She was exercising every day,"" he said. ""She was so fit, incredibly fit. She had a gym at home, and she was exercising for three or four hours a day, if not more.""  Winehouse tries not to harbor too much regret or guilt. ""As a family,"" he said, ""we really couldn't have done any more to support her and love her and nurture her in the way that we do with every other member of our family.""

He was 74, coroner Nate Brown said. Speakes took over the duties as acting White House press secretary after James Brady, the press secretary, was shot during an assassination attempt on Reagan on March 30,1981. He chronicled his experience in the 1987 book ""Speaking Out: The Reagan Presidency from Inside the White House."" Speakes was born in Cleveland, Mississippi, on September 13, 1939, according to Current Biography.

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- U.S. airstrikes aimed at al Qaeda leaders in Pakistan have been ""very effective,"" with few civilian deaths as a result, CIA Director Leon Panetta said Monday in a rare public acknowledgment of the raids. CIA Director Leon Panetta speaks about the fight against al Qaeda at the Pacific Council on International Policy. Asked about criticism of the missile attacks by counterinsurgency experts, Panetta said he did not want to discuss specifics, ""but I can assure you that in terms of that particular area, it is very precise and is very limited in terms of collateral damage."" ""Very frankly, it's the only game in town in terms of confronting or trying to disrupt the al Qaeda leadership,"" Panetta told the Pacific Council on International Policy in Los Angeles. Pakistan has complained repeatedly about what it says are airstrikes on its territory by U.S.-operated drones. The U.S. military in neighboring Afghanistan does not comment on the attacks, which typically target Islamic militants in the border region, but the United States is the only country operating in the region known to have the capability to launch missiles from remote-controlled aircraft. Panetta's predecessor, Michael Hayden, was asked about the drone attacks on Pakistani territory shortly before he left office in January, but addressed it far less directly than Panetta. ""I'm not going to talk about anything operational, and I'm not confirming or denying how any of this happens, we're not getting into that,"" he said. But he said he believed al Qaeda leaders had come to view Pakistan's tribal regions as ""neither safe nor a haven."" Two leading former advisers on counterinsurgency warfare, David Kilcullen and Andrew Exum, wrote in The New York Times over the weekend that the strikes have killed about 14 terrorist leaders in the past three years -- but Pakistani sources say the civilian death toll could be as high as 700. While U.S. officials dispute that ratio, Kilcullen and Exum wrote, ""Every one of these dead noncombatants represents an alienated family, a new desire for revenge and more recruits for a militant movement that has grown exponentially even as drone strikes have increased."" ""The persistence of these attacks on Pakistani territory offends people's deepest sensibilities, alienates them from their government and contributes to Pakistan's instability,"" Kilcullen and Exum said. They compared the tactics to British bombardment of the same region in the 1920s and French airstrikes on Algeria in the 1950s, arguing that the strikes were likely to remind Pakistanis of colonial rule. U.S. forces have been battling al Qaeda and its Taliban allies in Afghanistan since the terrorist network's 2001 attacks on New York and Washington. Both have taken root across the rugged border in Pakistan, where Pakistani troops are waging an air and ground offensive to crush the Taliban in the Swat Valley, northwest of the capital, Islamabad. Prime Minister Yusuf Reza Gilani said Monday that the offensive will go on ""until peace is established.""

Wade and Union, who've been an item since 2008, set their nuptials apart with the hashtag #thewadeunion, which they used to share their special moment with fans. ""Happy,"" a smiling Union wrote on Instagram Saturday. ""All my loved ones are in town... Today is a good day... I must say I'm feeling blessed and humbled and just freakin happy.""

"Washington (CNN) -- Two Democratic lawmakers took on the hot-button political issue of gun control Monday, introducing legislation that would effectively ban online ammunition sales. Longtime gun control advocates Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-New Jersey, and Rep. Carolyn McCarthy, D-New York, introduced the bill that they said would prevent buyers from purchasing unlimited quantities of ammunition through the Internet or through the mail. The bill would also require ammunition dealers to report bulk ammo sales to law enforcement. ""It's time to close the loophole that's allowing killers -- deranged, insane -- and even terrorists to buy ammunition online,"" Lautenberg said Monday at a news conference on the steps of Manhattan's City Hall. ""You don't have to be a scientist to understand how wrong this is."" The lawmakers pointed to the Colorado mass shooting earlier this month, where police in Aurora said movie shooting suspect James Holmes purchased more than 6,000 rounds of ammunition online. Holmes faces 24 murder counts . On Monday, Holmes was charged with 24 counts of first-degree murder in the slayings of 12 people who had packed a screening of the latest Batman movie that began shortly after midnight on July 20. Fifty-eight people were injured in the incident. ""When you buy a gun on the Internet, you have go to a store to pick that gun up,"" McCarthy said. ""Well if you're going to be buying these kinds of large amounts of ammunition, you know what? Somebody should see your face."" Democratic strategists see gun control as political dynamite. Many Democrats blame Al Gore's 2000 presidential election loss on his failure to win conservative states, an outcome they said was due in part to Gore's push for gun control. And many members of Congress admittedly do not want to run afoul of the powerful and well-funded National Rifle Association. Many Democrats won't touch gun control . Last week, Arizona Democrat Raul Grijalva, who represents a pro-gun congressional district, told CNN the NRA ""carries with it a threat ... that if you speak against any point of gun control, you automatically face a political threat."" In fact, the Democratic-led Senate has not voted on any gun legislation in three years, since defeating a 2009 GOP measure that would have required states to recognize each other's gun laws. President Barack Obama on Thursday made his strongest comments yet on the issue, advocating a ""common sense"" approach to gun control that would prevent a ""mentally unbalanced individual"" from obtaining assault weapons. But he treaded carefully and did not push for new gun laws. ""I, like most Americans, believe that the Second Amendment guarantees an individual the right to bear arms,"" Obama said. ""But I also believe that a lot of gun owners would agree that AK-47s belong in the hands of soldiers, not in the hands of criminals."" Lautenberg and McCarthy's proposed Stop Online Ammunition Sales Act would require ammunition buyers who are not licensed dealers to present photo identification at the time of purchase, effectively banning the online or mail order purchase of ammo by regular civilians. It also requires licensed ammunition dealers to report the sale of more than 1,000 rounds of ammunition to an unlicensed person within any five consecutive business days. Lautenberg recognized that changing gun laws is a challenge. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, who controls the Senate's agenda, said Thursday, ""With the schedule we have, we're not going to get into the debate on gun control."" House Speaker John Boehner said Thursday that existing laws should be enforced. ""AK-47s, all right, are not allowed to be in the hands of criminals. That is the law,"" he said. Nonetheless, Lautenberg said he thinks the bill's chances are ""pretty good."" ""It's going to be acted upon next week, and we're very optimistic,"" Lautenberg said.

"(Fast Company) -- Have you ever created a Genius playlist on iTunes or set up a station on Pandora? Just plug in one song, and you instantly hear music that matches your tastes. Think of Zite, the free personalized iPad magazine that launched today, as the Genius playlist or Pandora of news discovery -- but with one noticeable advantage: Zite is smarter, at least for now. Developed by researchers at the University of British Columbia's Laboratory for Computational Intelligence, the technology behind Zite can learn your reading habits and personalize content based on your interests. When first opening the app, Zite will immediately begin personalizing your experience. Link a Twitter account or Google Reader, and Zite will analyze (not simply display) your feeds to create a magazine tailored to your interests. You might get sources you know, you might get content you want from sources you don't know. (And yes, you'll occasionally get stories you have no interest in -- just tell Zite and it catches on pretty quickly.) After adding my Twitter handle @austincarr, for example, Zite learned my tastes and created relevant sections -- entrepreneurship, gadgets, social media. It then culled news items from fitting sources -- Fast Company, Wired, TechCrunch, Fred Wilson's blog. As I skimmed through the news, Zite began learning my preferences. What specifically do I like about social media? Was I interested in long-form journalism? Did I enjoy straight-news items or editorials? Features or analysis? Popular sources or niche blogs? The more feedback Zite collected, the more personalized it became. ""It's a combination of semantic- and statistically based machine learning,"" says CEO Ali Davar, of Zite's content algorithm, the technology of which has been in development for years. ""It works by looking at the articles you click on and the characteristics of those articles. Is the article longer or shorter? Is it skewed toward one element of a topic or another? Is it a political blog? If so, does it have have a right- or left-wing slant?"" Users can tell Zite whether they enjoyed a particular article, whether they liked a particular source, or whether they want more news on a particular topic area. But Zite can also learn from a user's ""soft"" yes's and no's. Skip over a news brief? Zite counts that as a soft no. Did a headline catch your eye and get you to read the longer story? Zite counts that as a soft yes. News will soon narrow from, say, articles on food or sports to thousands of specialized sections such as news on vegetarianism or skiing. Users can select these topics on their own, but Zite is best at autosuggesting them--after playing with the app for a week, Zite began featuring ""Graphic Design & Typography"" as one of my top news sections. Would I have thought to add that category on my own? According to the Vancouver-based company, Zite is the first iPad news reader ""to go beyond manual customization."" Other popular readers -- Flipboard, Pulse -- require users to manually provide sources, whether media outlets or RSS feeds. Zite automates that process and continuously refines content so it's fresher and dynamically tailored to one's interests. ""The difference between Flipboard and Zite is that with Zite, your sections are actually personalized,"" Davar says. ""On Flipboard, you pick sections and sources to customize your magazine -- that's what they call 'personalized.' But that's really 'customization.' In essence, personalization is a technology -- it's something that learns from you. So, for example, your technology section and someone else's will look very different based on your behavior -- rather than being the same generic thing that everyone else is seeing."" Still, loyal Flipboard fans might find the app just a bit more elegant, or feel the apps serve different purposes. Since Flipboard features only hand-picked sources, the app is arguably very personalized: Just as one might only subscribe to New York magazine or The Economist in print, one might only be interested in subscribing to those mags on Flipboard -- and less interested in reading similar content from other sources. In this sense, Zite, with its endlessly fresh content culled from a wide range of media outlets, is more akin to a digital newspaper, whereas Flipboard (especially with its far sexier and sleeker design) feels more like a digital magazine. But when it comes to ""personalized"" content discovery, Zite follows in the same impressive footsteps as Pandora and Netflix -- and certainly gives Flipboard a run for its money. ""The underlying philosophy of our algorithm is: You are what you read,"" Davar says. Copyright Â© 2010 FastCompany.com, a unit of Mansueto Ventures, LLC.

"New York (CNN) -- An activist for immigration reform was arrested and arraigned on child pornography charges in Brooklyn federal court Wednesday. Roy Naim, 29, pleaded not guilty to a count of receiving child pornography, and was denied bail by Judge Joan M. Azrack. Assistant U.S. Attorney Saritha Komatireddy argued Naim was a risk to the community as his alleged crimes involved children, and he sometimes worked with a youth advocacy group and volunteered at a camp for children. She added he was a flight risk as he has no real job and isn't a citizen of the country. Florida man linked to up to 1 million child porn videos, images . Naim's attorney, Richard A Finkel, countered that his client was a respected member of his community, and told the court how Naim, who was mentioned in a 2012 Time magazine article on immigration reform, volunteered for many charities and had become a relatively well-known activist on immigration. Finkel continued to explain that Naim did not work because he spent most of his time ""helping others"" and studying with rabbis. His family works hard, Finkel said, but they have little money and own no property. Judge Azrack did not say she would deny Naim bail outright, but said without money or property to offer as collateral, Naim would be kept in custody for now. Finkel told reporters as he left the courthouse that he had just been put on the case and ""I don't know much about it ... They're just charges and we will contest the charges, and that's all I can say."" Prosecutor Komatireddy declined comment on the case. Smartphone app helps nab child sexual predators . Naim moved with his family from Israel when he was 3 years old, but has not attained U.S. citizenship. Naim was mentioned in a cover story for Time magazine in June 2012 by journalist and filmmaker, Jose Antonio Vargas, who publicly revealed his own status as an undocumented immigrant and gaining support among so-called DREAMers -- advocates for a path to citizenship for young undocumented immigrants. In a story on his life that he wrote for the website Empathizethis.com, Naim said, ""I read this article about Jose Antonio Vargas, who outed himself as an undocumented person. I remember reading that article, and it gave me a lot of hope. I started connecting with Jose, and I ended up (in) Time magazine with him."" Naim continued in the online biography, ""If you ask me what I want to do, I would say that I want to serve people. Volunteer work is what I live for."" In June, the New York Daily News ran an article about Naim's work with a children's advocacy group on a game for children based on the immigrant experience. Ex-PTA president accused of making child porn at elementary school . According to the federal indictment of Naim, investigators in Louisiana arrested a suspected producer of child pornography who allegedly had enticed children to engage in sexually explicit conduct on the internet via videoconferencing. The suspect allegedly recorded the acts, and sent the videos to people over the web and through e-mail. Following an electronic trail, investigators were led to a computer at Naim's home according to the indictment. Federal agents executed a search warrant, the indictment says, and told Naim he was not under arrest, but asked him if there was any information he wanted to share voluntarily. According to the indictment, Naim led the agents to his computer and told them he had been viewing and downloading videos of child pornography for several years, and his a laptop contained videos of child pornography. He was then arrested. If convicted, Naim faces five to 20 years in prison, according to the U.S. attorney's office.

"Fort Meade, Maryland (CNN) -- Pfc. Bradley Manning pleaded guilty Thursday to 10 of the 22 charges against him -- but not the most serious one, ""aiding the enemy"" -- in what the government says is the largest leak of classified documents in the nation's history. And, for the first time, Manning offered his rationale for the crimes. In court, Manning detailed why and how he sent classified material to WikiLeaks, a group that facilitates the anonymous leaking of secret information through its website. He said he passed on information that ""upset"" or ""disturbed"" him, but nothing he thought would harm the United States if it became public. Manning said he thought the documents were old and the situations they referred to had changed or ended. Reading a statement for more than an hour, Manning described his motivations, beginning with what he called ""sigact tables,"" documents describing significant actions in Iraq and Afghanistan that he said represented the ""ground reality"" of both conflicts. He said he'd become ""depressed about the situation there"" and made copies of the sigact tables in his secure workstation in Iraq. Then, he took them back to the United States and pondered what to do with them. Manning said he first called The Washington Post. He spoke to a woman who he believed was a reporter and told her the kind of material he had. After five minutes, he got the impression she wasn't taking him seriously, he said. He said he then called The New York Times and got nothing but answering machines, so he left a message and his phone number and e-mail address, but never heard back. Manning said he finally decided to send the documents to the WikiLeaks organization. ""I believed if the public was aware of the data, it would start a public debate of the wars,"" he told the court. Manning acknowledged to the court he was not authorized to receive the classified documents he leaked and said he knows that he had other avenues through which he could have expressed his dissatisfaction. Exposing State Department cables, military video . After he sent the documents to WikiLeaks in early 2010, Manning said earlier, he became aware of an online debate about Iceland's financial troubles and its relations with the United Kingdom. He decided to learn more about the issue, using his access to State Department cables. He said he sympathized with Iceland in the dispute and believed that Iceland was being ""bullied"" by the UK, and that the United States wouldn't help. So he decided to send related information to WikiLeaks. It was published to the world within hours. At that same time, Manning said he learned about Reuters' battle with the U.S. military over video of a helicopter gunship attack on a truck carrying a Reuters news crew in Iraq. Two Reuters staffers were killed in the attack. He said the military told Reuters that the video might not exist, but Manning had seen it. He made a copy of the video and planned to send it to Reuters when his tour ended. Manning said the video and the behavior of the Americans involved was so disturbing, ""It burdens me emotionally."" He was so upset, he decided to upload the video to WikiLeaks immediately. In that case, Manning said, WikiLeaks did not publish the video right away. Later, while communicating through chat rooms with a person whom he believed to be a top WikiLeaks official, he was told that the video was about to be published, and that he wouldn't be hearing much from them for a while. ""I'd have nothing but work to distract me,"" Manning said. Apparently bored by his regular analyst duties and prodded what he described as a curiosity about geopolitics, he began reading the State Department cables. He decided the American public should know how its diplomats go about conducting foreign affairs. Manning took the most widely distributed diplomatic cables and made copies for WikiLeaks. ""I believed that the public release of these cables would not damage the United States, but might be embarrassing,"" he told the court. The court proceedings . After Manning's guilty pleas, Army judge Col. Denise Lind asked the defendant questions to establish that he understood what he was pleading guilty to. In addition, she reminded him that his lawyer had filed a motion to have the case dismissed on the grounds that he was denied his right to a speedy trial -- a motion that Lind denied Tuesday. By entering guilty pleas, Manning loses his right to have an appellate court consider that ruling, if he chooses to appeal. A military lawyer who follows the case told CNN the tactic is known as a ""naked plea,"" or a guilty plea in the absence of a plea deal. The lawyer said that by using that strategy, the defense apparently hopes the government will feel victorious about the guilty pleas Manning has entered and won't go through the effort of a trial. But prosecutors reiterated that they will pursue the rest of the case against Manning. The judge accepted the guilty pleas, but noted Manning could withdraw them at any time prior to sentencing. He could receive up to 20 years on those charges. Manning said deciding to make the material public was ""beyond my pay grade."" Manning has asked for Lind, instead of the military equivalent of a jury, to decide his guilt or innocence on the 12 charges to which he pleaded not guilty. The most serious remaining charge, aiding the enemy, carries the potential for a life sentence. The U.S. military initially detained Manning in May 2010, shortly after WikiLeaks published the State Department cables. Manning was turned in by Adrian Lamo, a former hacker, whom Manning allegedly told about leaking the classified records. In December 2011, Manning's Article 32 hearing, the military equivalent of a grand jury hearing to determine whether enough evidence existed to merit a court-martial, began. He was formally charged in February 2012. After a military judge denied Manning's lawyers' motions to dismiss charges in April 2012, the process proceeded, with Manning's court-martial scheduled to begin on June 3. Larry Shaughnessy reported from Fort Meade and Mark Morgenstein wrote this report in Atlanta.","Manning offers his rationale for the crimes, saying he didn't mean to harm the U.S.

"(CNN) -- Beneath the streets of Budapest, behind the locked door of a brick cellar that smells faintly of mold, four tourists are trying their hardest to break out. In the room with them are various vehicle parts, a computer and a walkie-talkie, which their captor uses to taunt them as a timer counts down their remaining seconds. ""You can't manage to get out on your own,"" says Attila Gyurkovics, watching the futile efforts of his four captives via video surveillance. It may sound like their vacation has gone terribly wrong, but the four have actually paid to be incarcerated and, it seems, they're enjoying themselves. This is the subterranean world of escape games, a craze that's swept through Budapest. The games see participants pit their wits against a series of mental and physical challenges in order to gain their freedom in the quickest time possible -- under the watchful eyes of an all-powerful gamesmaster. Though escape games are now appearing across Europe, Budapest claims to have pioneered this unlikely new entertainment. What it takes to play . The city now hosts nearly 100 versions and the activity is listed as a top attraction on Tripadvisor. Typically, participants find themselves locked in two or three semi-derelict rooms in a Budapest basement. There they must search for keys and clues that will trigger the mechanisms that will free them from the labyrinth. ""It's really fun, you get absorbed in the story and forget about the rest,"" says Audrey, from France. She's emerging from one of three separate challenge zones at Parapark, an escape game hidden beneath Gondozo, one of Budapest's so called ""ruin bars"" (4, Vajdahunyad Street, Budapest; +36 30 619 5447). Parapark, the domain of gamesmaster 38-year-old Gyurkovics, lays claim to creating the phenomenon in 2011. ""Parapark is really for everyone,"" he says, keeping an eye on a monitor on which his four captives are still trying to solve a mystery based around a driving lesson. ""Kids from 12 or even smaller can already play. An intellectual and someone who's never been to college can perform equally well."" Gyurkovics, who studied team-building strategies at university, says he devised Parapark as a way of testing group dynamics. He says there's a need to strike a careful balance to engage participants without overly frustrating them. ""Tasks should be neither too easy nor too hard,"" he says. ""First you think it's impossible to solve the puzzle, but at the end of the day you manage to pick up the elements you'll need to open the exit door."" Flirting with the horror genre . Two months after Parapark was launched, the former social worker quit his job to focus on his new creation. ""It looked clear that I would be able to make a living out of escape games,"" he says. He's since hired five employees and begun franchises abroad -- a smart move given that he faces stiff competition from rivals. Budapest now offers escape challenges for all tastes, most costing about $40 per group of two to six people. Some, such as Underground Fear (3 Barcsay St., Budapest; +36 20 528 2191) flirt with the horror genre. Others, like Code13 (44 Rottenbiller St., Budapest; +36 6 70 7027 517) or Locked Escape (10-12 Vermezo Way, Budapest; + 36 30 458 2905) take their cues from Sherlock Holmes. In a high-ceilinged cellar just off Budapest's luxurious Andrassy Avenue lies Trap (20 Paulay Ede St., Budapest) an escape game that recently topped TripAdvisor's list of attractions in the Hungarian capital. Featuring a well designed medieval gallery on one side and an Egyptian pharaoh-themed sliding door challenge on the other, Trap welcomes about 200 groups a month -- 90% of them from abroad. Its founder, former logistics company owner Zoltan Kovacs, is also pushing beyond Hungary's borders with tracks planned in Prague and Berlin. Coming back for more . ""The phenomenon has its seasonality, but we're keeping on expanding,"" he says. Escape games seem to be sound investment in Budapest, where real estate is cheap and low-cost labor is abundant -- not to mention the huge visitor numbers the city attracts. Kovacs says his two challenge zones at Paulay Ede street cost him roughly $22,000. The investment appears to be paying off. ""Two years ago my mother thought I was absolutely crazy but now she has changed her mind,"" he says. As he chats, one of Trap's challenge doors opens and four British tourists, Omid, Leo, Jason and Ben, emerge from what they say is their second visit. ""We loved it,"" says Ben. ""I'm amazed we did so well! You have very little time to think ahead who would do what. ""We'll definitely come back."" Back over at Parapark, Gyurkovics's four captives are still struggling with their driving test challenge. He picks up his walkie-talkie to offer the kind of sage advice you'd expect from someone responsible for creating what may soon be a global phenomenon. ""You need to play as a team. And use your brain! You have to be on the lookout for clues."" CNN Travel's series often carries sponsorship originating from the countries and regions we profile.

"UNITED NATIONS (CNN) -- The United Nations moved closer to appointing a commission to investigate the death of former Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto after a meeting between Pakistan's foreign minister and the world body's secretary-general. Pakistan FM Makhdoom Shah Mahmood Qureshi made the request on Thursday. Foreign Minister Makhdoom Shah Mahmood Qureshi formally made the request Thursday with U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon, who ""responded positively to the issue,"" according to a statement from the United Nations. The statement said that the two reached ""broad understanding"" on several issues, including funding, composition of the commission and unhindered access to resources, but added that the secretary-general indicated further discussions with Pakistan and other U.N. members would be needed before the commission could be set to work. The secretary-general, however, indicated further discussions with Pakistan and other U.N. members would be needed before the commission could be set to work, the statement added. Bhutto was killed December 27 in Rawalpindi, south of the Pakistani capital, Islamabad, while she was standing in an armored moving car rallying supporters for parliamentary elections. Her head was above the roof and unprotected at the time of the attack. The cause of her death is in dispute. A bomber blew himself up near her car, and videotape showed a gunman present. In the hours after her assassination, Pakistan's Interior Ministry said she died from a bullet or shrapnel wound. But the day after her death, officials said she died from a skull fracture suffered when she fell or ducked into the car as a result of the shots or explosion and her head crashed into a sunroof latch. In February, the Interior Ministry said Scotland Yard investigators agreed with the latter conclusion. ""What the government had said on the 28 December was not a knee-jerk reaction,"" ministry spokesman Javed Iqbal Cheema said at the time. ""Whatever I had said was based on certain hard facts."" Bhutto's family and her Pakistan People's Party (PPP), meanwhile, has vehemently insisted she was shot by an assassin's bullet. However, relatives have refused to carry out an autopsy on her body.  Watch reaction to the Scotland Yard investigation Â» . In April, Pakistan's National Assembly unanimously adopted a resolution calling for a U.N. probe into Bhutto's death -- a move that was not surprising, given that the government and parliament elected in February is dominated by a coalition led by the PPP. Pakistan's President Pervez Musharraf initially balked at a U.N. inquiry into Bhutto's death. His government -- ousted from power in February -- had contended the killing was orchestrated by Baitullah Mehsud, a leader of the Pakistani Taliban with ties to al Qaeda. The CIA reached the same conclusion. But two nationwide polls conducted this year found that a majority of Pakistanis believe Musharraf's government was complicit in Bhutto's assassination. Qureshi met with Ban Thursday regarding the probe. His request will likely need the approval of others within the United Nations and perhaps the U.N. Security Council. The investigation should be done in the shortest possible time, Qureshi said, but he added that he cannot dictate its terms. He said investigators would have unhindered access to sources of information. CNN's Richard Roth contributed to this report.","NEW: Ban and Qureshi reached ""broad understanding"" on the commission .

"(CNN) -- Reports that Iran is plotting to attack American targets in Iraq in response to U.S. intervention in Syria should come as no surprise. Armed conflicts are unpredictable and risky. But this latest communication, allegedly intercepted by U.S. intelligence, may prove less ominous than it sounds. According to an article in the Wall Street Journal, the United States intercepted a message sent from Tehran to militants in neighboring Iraq, ordering them to target the American embassy in Baghdad and other U.S. interests if American forces strike Syria. Assuming that the information is correct -- and not meant by Iran to get into U.S. hands to send a threat -- it would seem that Iran will resort to its long-standing practice of using proxy militias and assorted terrorist groups to do its dirty work. This is as an alternative to stepping into the conflict with its own forces, which would escalate the war in Syria much more dangerously. In fact, it doesn't make a lot of sense for Tehran to jump in against the United States, even if Syria is Iran's closest ally and Iran is already providing President Bashar al-Assad with weaponry and other support. Iran, incidentally, has also coordinated with its Lebanese ally, the Shiite militia Hezbollah, which has gone all in, fighting alongside al-Assad. Despite their many threats, neither Hezbollah nor Iran want to take on the U.S., or Israel for that matter, to fight in a war they cannot win. Since U.S. President Barack Obama announced he wants to launch military strikes against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in response to what many nations agree was a chemical weapons attack that killed hundreds of civilians on August 21, opponents of U.S. intervention have expressed fear that the war would spread to a much larger regional, even global conflagration. Again, there is no way of predicting with certainty how the conflict would unfold, but an Iranian decision to launch its own armed forces, or even to take major action in other ways against the Americans, does not make strategic sense. Shiite Tehran fervently wants to see al-Assad emerge victorious in this civil war against a Sunni opposition. But the ruling establishment in Iran today is deeply divided over how far their country should go in protecting the Syrian dictator. Iran's hard-liners want to push ahead with nuclear enrichment. Starting a war with the United States before that process is completed would defeat its purpose. Iran's more moderate politicians, led today by the newly elected President Hassan Rouhani and his team, have engaged in an extraordinary campaign of image repair. Rouhani tweeted a ""Happy Rosh Hashanah"" greeting on the occasion of the Jewish New Year, and his foreign minister condemned the Holocaust, a statement that would not be remarkable from almost any other country, but coming from Iran is an eyebrow-raiser after the extraordinarily low bar set by former President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. In more signs of some powerful Iranians distancing from Syria, another moderate (by Iranian standards), former President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, blamed Assad for the chemical gas attack. Iranians are sensitive to those charges, since they suffered horrific gas attacks during the war against Iraq in the 1980s. On this issue, Rafsanjani has now put himself squarely on the opposite side of the hard-liners, who vow America will suffer the consequences of interfering in Syria. Rouhani, meanwhile, issued a startlingly nonbelligerent warning to America. ""If something happens to the Syrian people,"" he told the Assembly of Experts, a key decision-making body in Tehran, ""the Islamic Republic will do its religious and humanitarian duties to send food and medicine."" While Rouhani was launching his Rosh Hashanah charm offensive, the head of the Revolutionary Guards' elite Quds Force, Qasem Suleimani, darkly warned that a U.S. attack on Syria would result in the ""destruction of Israel."" It was Suleimani who reportedly contacted Shiite militias in Iraq, some of them trained by the Iranians, with the instructions to target the U.S. Embassy there. Hezbollah, too, which is closely linked with the Iranian Revolutionary Guards Corps, is reportedly awaiting instructions from Tehran on how to respond to an American strike. Hezbollah's leader, Hassan Nasrallah, took a risky gamble entering the war in Syria. He was once one of the most popular leaders in the Arab world, proclaiming that his organization's only reason for being was to fight Israel. He has now allied himself with Syria's al-Assad, a man with blood on his hands, for the sake of protecting the Syrian regime and Iranian interests. According to the Saudi newspaper Okaz, a Lebanese source said Hezbollah will attack Israel only ""after receiving a specific order from Iran."" Hezbollah might try to launch some symbolic attack, perhaps a few rockets. But the group is bogged down in Syria. The last thing it wants is to trigger a massive Israeli -- much less an American -- retaliation. Whatever the divisions among Iranians and the concerns of anti-American militias and terrorist groups about taking on the United States, the threats have to be taken seriously. And it's worth remembering that attacks against civilians and other nonmilitary targets can be launched by small groups, providing deniability to their masters. The U.S. is already evacuating nonessential personnel from a number of diplomatic facilities in the Middle East and has advised American citizens to stay out of Iraq. Some of those warnings, however, went into place before the August 21 nerve gas attack and before Obama's call for action. The Syrian war was already spreading to other countries. The risks did not begin with the American debate over intervention. The plot warnings are a reminder that war is always dangerous. But we all knew that. The threats do nothing to change the moral and strategic calculus about whether or not to the United States should strike Syria. The opinions in this commentary are solely those of Frida Ghitis.","Frida Ghitis: Reports Iran urging militants to target U.S. sites if U.S. hits Syria not surprising .
She says it may show Iran using proxies to attack rather than take on war it can't win .
She says Iran's Shiites want Assad to prevail but its rulers divided on how much to help .

"(CNN) -- Time was running out for Julian Assange. If the WikiLeaks frontman was going to make a move it would be soon. Just days before Assange had lost his final bid in Britain's highest court to stop his extradition to Sweden for questioning about sexual assault allegations. The court had set a July 7 deadline. Though the sexual misconduct case has nothing to do with WikiLeaks, some of his supporters believe that if Assange is sent to Sweden, he would be vulnerable to extradition to the United States. WikiLeaks published a trove of State Department cables and secret documents, some of them classified, about the Iraq and Afghanistan wars. Assange is not currently facing criminal charges in the U.S. So where in the world should Assange turn for refuge? He picked Ecuador, which has just approved his request for asylum. ""It's a very smart move to go there. Ecuador's President Rafael Correa and Assange have mutual interests -- they both support the idea that the U.S. is an imperial power that has to be checked,"" said Robert Amsterdam, a Canadian international lawyer who's worked high profile cases involving Latin America, Russia and Thailand. He said the information contained in the cables WikiLeaks released has helped in some of his cases. Correa, a left-leaning economist, has railed against the United States in concert with allies in the region and elsewhere -- Venezuela's Hugo Chavez, Bolvia's Evo Morales, Cuba's Fidel Castro and Iran's Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. As far as angering the British government, Correa has shown he doesn't mind doing that. In February, Correa called for sanctions against Britain for its long-running dispute with Argentina over who owns the Falkland Islands. ""From a Latin perspective, what a glorious thing to get Assange,"" Amsterdam said. ""You don't have to be even anti-American to want to do that. When I'm in Guatemala, they still call the (U.S.) 'the empire.' There really is an almost universal hostility toward American foreign policy. Assange would be welcomed in many countries just for that fact."" Jorge Leon, an Ecuadorian political analyst who lives in Quito, said that with presidential elections in Ecuador scheduled for next February giving Assange asylum in the country could be ""useful to Correa to give himself a leftist image."" ""A lot of his base is leftist,"" said Leon. ""He has to feed that base."" Correa and Assange . Ecuadorian president Correa recently appeared on Assange's new television show, ""The World Tomorrow,"" which began broadcasting in April on R-TV, Russia's state-funded English language channel. Assange introduced his guest by calling Correa ""a transformative leader,"" and pointed out that Correa expelled the U.S. ambassador after reports that a WikiLeaks State Department cable showed that the American ambassador was concerned about an allegedly corrupt high ranking police official. The cable, published by Spanish newspaper El Pais, said Correa was aware of corruption by the police high command. The website of Assange's TV show described it differently, saying the cable showed the U.S. ""embassy exercising influence over members of the Ecuadorian police force."" ""Your WikiLeaks has made us stronger!"" Correa told Assange. Assange and Correa seemed to have a rapport, praising each other and at times laughing like old friends who shared inside jokes. Assange began the interview by asking Correa what he thinks of the United States. Correa answered by accusing the U.S. of meddling in Ecuador's police force, yet then said the countries have a relationship based on ""affection and friendship."" Correa went on to say he lived in the U.S. for four years and got two academic degrees in the U.S. ""I love and admire the American people a great deal,"" he said. ""The last thing I'd be is anti-American, but I will always call a spade a spade."" Later in the interview, Correa laughs about his decision not to renew the U.S. Southern Command's lease of Eloy Alfaro Air Base in Manta, which ended U.S. occupancy of the base in 2009. Correa sarcastically suggested that he should be able to keep a base in Miami. ""I'm enjoying your jokes a great deal,"" Assange told the Ecuadorian president. A press freedom fighter in Ecuador? ""That interview was just Assange asking Correa a bunch of softball questions,"" said Adam Isacson of the Regional Security Policy Program of human rights group Washington Office on Latin America. Isacson and other experts point out that Correa loves disclosures when it suits him, but he has one of the worst reputations in Latin America for cracking down on journalists. Correa has filed defamation complaints against journalists who criticized him, forced independent radio and television stations to air lengthy rebuttals of critical reports, pre-empted programming and temporarily shut some stations down, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists. In a June 9 radio address, Correa asked government ministers to stop granting interviews to private media because those outlets are ""corrupt."" Wouldn't that bother Assange, a self-professed pillar of the free press? Well, experts say, Assange's show is broadcast by a network financed by the Kremlin and Russia isn't known for its press freedoms. Standing up for freedom of the press may seem less important to Assange than saving himself right now, said Amsterdam. ""If he winds up getting extradited to the U.S. many people believe he'd never see the light of day again,"" the attorney said. ""Assange is in a very dangerous place,"" Amsterdam said. But he said he feels the information disclosed by the WikiLeaks releases has ""been incredible. It's so important."" A legal and diplomatic 'mess' If Assange thought he was in trouble by staying in Britain, he could be in even more trouble if he tries to leave, said international human rights attorney Jared Genser. Genser is best known for helping to free Burmese Nobel Peace laureate Aung San Suu Kyi. ""The big challenge would be getting Assange from the Ecuadorian Embassy in London to Ecuador. It would be very difficult,"" Genser said. ""He could end up spending years living in the embassy as the Brits aren't likely to look too kindly on this stunt and the Ecuadorians might provide him protection in their mission. ""But it would be much more difficult to get him out and to a private plane to transit to Ecuador."" Assange is subject to arrest by British authorities for violating a bail requirement that he spend every night at the home outside London, police said in June. In a written statement, London Metropolitan police said that they were notified Assange may have breached one of the conditions of his bail. If Assange shows up in Ecuador there could be criminal repercussions and diplomatic repercussions. ""If a fugitive were to show up in Ecuador after escaping from British territory and be protected by the Ecuador authorities, it would be a diplomatic mess,"" Isacson said. ""If Assange arrives in Ecuador, the first thing the Brits would probably do is remove their ambassador from Ecuador,"" he said. It would also mean American officials, experts said, would inevitably have to start talking about Assange again, two years after the WikiLeaker first became a thorn in their side by releasing his first batch of secret U.S. documents.

"(CNN) -- Chris Brown pleaded guilty to simple assault Tuesday to settle a case stemming from a sidewalk fight at a Washington hotel last October. ""I'm sorry, I am very sorry,"" Brown told the judge in the brief hearing in a District of Columbia court. The judge sentenced Brown, 25, to time served -- the one day he was locked up after his arrest -- and no probation for the simple assault conviction. He must also pay a $150 fine. The singer has already paid a heavy price for the incident -- it resulted in the revocation of his probation for the 2009 beating of ex-girlfriend Rihanna in Los Angeles. He spent five months in court-ordered rehab and another three months in jail because of it. His jail time also included two grueling cross-country trips on the federal government's ""Con Air"" inmate transport system. A doctor's letter included in a probation report said that Brown was diagnosed as bipolar, which is blamed for violent outbursts. Doctor: Chris Brown makes 'strides' to sobriety, 'personal growth' ""Mr. Brown has made significant strides in maintaining his sobriety, as well as developing skills that promote personal growth,"" a psychiatrist wrote in the most recent report in August. Read Brown's probation report (PDF) He is taking his twice-a-week court-ordered psychological therapy sessions seriously, the doctor said. ""He continues to show great perseverance in implementing recommendations made by his treatment team, utilizing his learned skills and seeking guidance in his recovery process,"" his doctor reported. Brown's probation officer said he has been ""working on personal growth"" and has been ""taking responsibility for his behaviors"" in the two months since he was freed from jail. His probation for the 2009 felony battery conviction is expected to end on January 23, 2015, as long as he stays out of legal trouble and completes another 600 hours of community labor, the probation officer said last month. The singer will spend three days each week until then working on a community labor crew. Brown was a teenager when his remarkable dancing and singing talents made him a pop star. He was 19 when he smashed Rihanna's face with his fist during an argument inside a rented Lamborghini on the evening of the 2009 Grammy Awards. With his legal troubles and probation requirements apparently nearing an end, Brown should have more time to concentrate on his career. He has a new album set to release this month, and he has teased fans with a Twitter post that suggested he would soon start a concert tour. Rihanna gives painful details of Chris Brown assault .

"MIAMI, Florida (CNN) -- What to do with an aging, all-but-forgotten former military strongman who has served his time but is also a prisoner of war? Manuel Noriega's U.S. drug trafficking sentence ended about 16 months ago, but he remains behind bars. The controversy over the next step for former Panamanian Gen. Manuel Noriega is winding its way through the federal courts. Arguments were heard Wednesday by an appeals court in Miami, Florida.    Noriega, who was captured in Panama by U.S. military forces, completed his prison sentence for drug trafficking and money laundering in September 2007 but remains imprisoned until the courts can decide where he should go. Noriega attorney Jon May told the court that his client wants to return to Panama and that the United States is obligated to return him under the Geneva Conventions. Assistant U.S. Attorney Sean Cronin said that the government has been asked to send Noriega to France and that there is nothing in the Geneva Conventions to prevent that. Noriega is 74. He was treated in prison for prostate cancer and suffered a stroke. He also claims to have found God. He did not attend the hearing. ""The general is in good mental condition, but he's very disappointed, because he wants to return home to Panama,"" said Frank Rubino, Noriega's longtime criminal defense attorney. ""He has fully served his sentence and should be repatriated back to the country he was seized from, Panama, just as the Geneva Convention says,"" Rubino added. But the U.S. government has a different take on the Geneva Conventions. U.S. authorities believe that they can transfer prisoners of war like Noriega to other countries and plan to honor a request by France to extradite Noriega there to stand trial for money laundering. Noriega was convicted in absentia in France, where he would get a new trial and retain his POW status. Panama also wants to retry Noriega for murder. He was convicted in absentia in Panama and sentenced to 60 years in prison, but Panama says it will also give him a new trial. Any sentence could be served only under house arrest because of Noriega's age. In court papers, the United States argues that ""nothing in the Geneva Conventions suggests that a prisoner-of-war cannot be extradited from one party nation to face criminal charges in another party nation."" Three federal courts have ruled against Noriega. Jon May, Noriega's appellate attorney, argued before the three-judge appeals court that ""the Geneva Convention trumps what is a legal extradition."" May told CNN that the Geneva Conventions are a wartime doctrine and were never intended for criminal matters. ""The most important document, humanitarian document, of the 20th century is the Geneva convention,"" May said outside the courthouse. "" Under the government's interpretation, individuals have lost their rights to come to court. If that's correct, that is a danger to every man and woman who serves in the armed forces around the world."" Rubino sees far-reaching implications. ""If they make bad law in this case, they will make bad law for all the American soldiers all over the world, who could conceivably be captured and held as a POW,"" he said. Noriega was captured when the United States invaded Panama in December 1989 on the orders of President George H.W. Bush. President Bush claimed that there were safety concerns for U.S. citizens living there. More than 20,000 U.S. troops stormed Panama. Noriega went into hiding and later sought refuge in the Papal Nuncio, the Vatican's Embassy. Days later, after being bombarded by rock music, Noriega surrendered to the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, which had a federal indictment waiting for him in Miami. It alleged that he had turned Panama into a transit point for U.S.-bound drugs and allowed drug money to be laundered in Panama's banks. The United States claimed that Noriega was the ultimate crooked cop, paid millions by the infamous Medellin drug cartel, headed by Pablo Escobar. Noriega was convicted in 1992. After the trial, he was declared a POW by Judge William Hoeveler, which set the stage for the current legal morass. Noriega was scheduled to be released about 16 months ago. He has been in prison for just over 19 years. At the end of all legal proceedings, the courts will make a recommendation to the U.S. secretary of state, who can accept or reject the court's ruling. The case will probably eventually go to the U.S. Supreme Court and the incoming Obama administration, specifically his secretary of state, will ultimately decide whether to follow the final court ruling. So, ultimately, the decision could be Hillary Clinton's. Noriega denied numerous interview requests by CNN in recent years, but speaking to CNN's Larry King in 1996, he claimed that the Bush administration had a vendetta against him and that his relationship with the United States went sour when he refused a U.S. request to conduct bombings and sabotage against Nicaragua's communist Sandinistas. It was revealed at his trial that Noriega was a paid CIA asset for many years. Noriega's attorney, Rubino, said the Obama administration brings new hope. ""I think they will probably look at this honestly and fairly and not with a slanted, jaundiced eye,"" Rubino said. ""He will not look at this as a way to get Gen. Noriega, like the Bushes do."" But one expert said Noriega will not get sympathy from Clinton, if she is confirmed as secretary of state. ""If you're looking for sympathy for a convicted international narcotics trafficker, you're not gonna find it,"" said Guy Lewis, a member of the prosecution team that convicted Noriega. Lewis went on to serve as U.S. attorney under President Clinton and President George W. Bush. ""The Clinton administration's zeal with which they went after drug traffickers was probably unmatched, so I don't think I'd be looking for a lot of comfort in the Clinton camp,"" Lewis said. Hillary Clinton's office would not comment and referred CNN to the Obama transition team. A spokeswoman for the transition team declined CNN's request for comment. Nevertheless, Noriega's defense team believes Noriega has a realistic chance if Clinton is confirmed as secretary of state. ""I think it's more than possible. We're asking her to send him to Panama to stand trial for murder, not for a vacation,"" attorney Rubino said.","Former Panamanian strongman Manuel Noriega is tangled in an extradition mess .

"(CNN) -- Tens of thousands of anti-government protesters are expected to join a march on Pakistan's capital as the country celebrates its independence. The protest was called by former Pakistan cricket captain and leader of the Tehreek-e-insaaf (PTI) political party, Imran Khan, who declared it a ""march of independence."" He has demanded the resignation of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif amid claims of vote rigging during last year's election. Another prominent opponent of the government, outspoken cleric Tahir ul Qadri, also called on his supporters to join what he described as a ""revolution march,"" sparking fresh security fears. Last week, at least five of his supporters were killed during clashes with security forces in the country's northwestern Punjab province. Qadri, who led protests against Pakistan's government last year that brought the capital to a standstill, has accused the Sharif government of corruption. Qadri has previously called for the military to be involved in the electoral process, causing alarm in a country with a history of coups. Critics accuse the cleric, who was until recently based in Canada, of working on behalf of the military -- an allegation he denies. He maintains that he is working only to ensure a corruption-free electoral process. Security operation . Thousands of security personnel have been deployed along the planned route from the city of Lahore to Islamabad, while massive shipping containers and reels of barbed wire have been used to seal off many roads. Cell phone coverage has also been temporarily suspended across some areas. Under Section 144 of Pakistan's penal code, the authorities have prohibited ""all kinds of gatherings of five or more persons, processions/rallies and demonstrations at any public place,"" while control of Islamabad's security has been handed to the army. Representatives of opposition leader Khan told CNN that they planned to arrive in the capital at 6 p.m. local time (9 a.m. ET) on Thursday, where they will rally in the city's ""red zone,"" a tightly controlled area containing many government buildings. Pakistan's Dawn News reported that an agreement has been struck between authorities and protest organizers to permit the rally on the condition participants remain in Islamabad for one day only. CNN could not confirm this. Government response . On Wednesday, in a rare address to the country, Prime Minister Sharif refuted accusations of electoral rigging and stressed that Pakistan has moved forward over the past 14 months in terms of ""currency value, foreign investment and economic growth."" In an apparent attempt to appease Khan's demands for an investigation into electoral fraud last year, Sharif offered to form a commission consisting of three Supreme Court judges to investigate the claims. But at a press conference shortly after the prime minister's address, Khan said the government's response had arrived too late in the day and that he was now officially calling for the resignation of Sharif. Protest leaders are expecting around 100,000 people to join the march during what is a national holiday to mark Pakistan's independence following British rule in 1947. Pakistan, so often a nation in crisis, is currently involved in a costly military campaign against militants in its restive northwestern tribal region. But the air and ground offensive has displaced an estimated 500,000 people -- including 180,000 children according to the United Nations -- from their homes in North Waziristan. 7 killed in Pakistan drone strike, sources say .","Opposition leader and former cricketer Imran Khan organized march from Lahore to capital .

"Editor's note: Glenn Beck is on CNN Headline News nightly at 7 and 9 ET and also hosts a conservative national radio talk show. Glenn Beck says conservation won't solve energy crisis, and we need more oil drilling in the U.S. NEW YORK (CNN) -- Call our politicians and tell them to stay on vacation. Call the caribou roaming in Alaska and tell them they're safe. Call the Saudi king and tell him what you really think of his oil. I, Glenn Beck, a recovering alcoholic rodeo clown, have come up with a solution to America's energy crisis...and you're wearing it. Look at yourself right now. You've probably got on a shirt, socks, shoes, jewelry, maybe even some pants. Do you have any idea how much all of that weighs? If people really loved America, they would strip down, leave their clothes at home, and drive around buck naked. That would decrease the weight of our cars, which would increase our gas mileage so dramatically that we probably wouldn't have to drill for any new oil! Genius, right? Of course, my idea has about as much of a chance to make a real difference in our energy crisis as the suggestion that Barack Obama recently made. ""Making sure your tires are properly inflated, simple thing,"" Obama said. ""But we could save all the oil that they're talking about getting off drilling, if everybody was just inflating their tires and getting regular tune-ups. You could actually save just as much."" When The Associated Press asked Obama's campaign for the figures they used to make that claim, they couldn't produce any -- but plenty of other people have. It turns out that about two-thirds of vehicles already have properly inflated tires. That means we'd likely save somewhere around 800,000 barrels of oil a day if everyone else also complied. Meanwhile, the U.S. Minerals Management Service estimates that there are about 86 billion barrels of oil in the areas that we're not allowed to drill. You do the math. But, facts aside, Obama seemed to be stunned that Republicans would dare ridicule an idea as revolutionary as checking your tire pressure. ""They're making fun of a step that every expert says would absolutely reduce our oil consumption,"" he complained. No, what they're making fun of is that a guy who, less than two months earlier, was against the gas tax holiday because it was a ""gimmick,"" has suddenly embraced what is essentially a gimmick. No one, including John McCain, disputes that keeping your tires inflated will help you get better gas mileage. But so will emptying your trunk, buying a hybrid, not using the heat, and driving naked. The point is that none of those things are solutions; they're unsustainable gimmicks that distract people from solving the underlying crisis. They're also exactly the type of things that Obama once claimed he was against. But, of course, the adoring mainstream media doesn't want to talk about that, they just want to defend Obama's honor. Michael Grunwald recently wrote an article titled, ""The Tire-Gauge Solution: No Joke,"" that probably would've been harsher on Obama if it was written by Barack himself. It's more love-sonnet than journalism. ""Meanwhile,"" he wrote, ""efficiency experts say that keeping tires inflated can improve gas mileage 3 percent and regular maintenance can add another 4 percent.   Many drivers already follow their advice, but if everyone did, we could immediately reduce demand several percentage points. In other words: Obama is right."" Of course he's right; he's Barack Obama, savior of the universe! But one phrase that he used deserves a little more attention: ""but if everyone did."" ""But if everyone"" donated their organs then people wouldn't die waiting for them. ""But if everyone"" ate only lettuce then our health care system would be fixed. ""But if everyone"" just sent me one dollar then I'd retire with $300 million in the bank. Of course, the reality is that people still die waiting for organs, obesity is an epidemic, and I'm still writing these columns. That's why saying ""but if everyone did"" is such a red herring. Grunwald went on to suggest that perhaps we're just over-thinking this whole ""energy crisis"" thing. ""It's a pretty simple concept,"" he wrote. ""If our use of fossil fuels is increasing our reliance on Middle Eastern dictators while destroying the planet, maybe we ought to use less."" Welcome back to Fantasy Land. Saying ""we ought to"" is exactly the same as ""but if everyone"" -- a way to make a ridiculous point sound plausible. It's like saying: We ought to all live in peace and harmony. It's not that easy. But let's follow his yellow brick road for a second anyway. If we all put on our Jimmy Carter sweaters and used less oil, we'd still need millions of barrels. How about making sure those barrels come from America by starting to drill for it now? We'll never be truly free until we're completely free from Middle Eastern oil. Not surprisingly, drilling was nowhere to be found in the article, but Grunwald did include plenty of other, ""simple"" things we can do: . ""We can use those twisty carbon fluorescent light bulbs. We can unplug our televisions, computers and phone chargers when we're not using them."" He's living in a dream world! Not only is unplugging a television not going to do a darn thing, it's annoying and almost no one in their right mind will ever, ever, ever, ever do it! Ever! And finally, just in case you weren't yet sure if Grunwald's article was essentially a commercial for Obama, here's how he ended it: . ""It's sad to see (McCain's) campaign adopting the politics of the tire gauge, promoting the fallacy that Americans are powerless to address their own energy problems. Because the truth is: Yes, we can..."" Hmm, let me think, where have I heard ""Yes we can"" before? Ohhh, that's right, it's what Obama supporters chant at his speeches. Is Obama's energy policy solely based on tire gauges? No. But can we criticize him for embracing the same kind of gimmicky stall tactics that have gotten us to this place? Yes. Yes we can. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the writer.","Beck: Americans could dramatically improve gas mileage by driving naked .
Obama's tire inflation advice is a gimmick rather than part of a plan, he says .
We can't conserve our way out of our energy problems, Beck says .
Beck: We won't be truly free until we're free from Middle Eastern oil ."
"(LifeWire)  -- Charlotte Eulette of Montclair, New Jersey, ceremoniously reclaimed her maiden name and slipped a ring from her mother on her newly bare wedding ring finger. Charlotte Eulette donned a shiny cocktail dress for her divorce celebration to reflect her goal to ""shine on.""

""If you split up, someone's getting the blender and someone's not,"" she says. ""My own celebration was a way for my friends to say, 'We love you no matter what, and by the way, here are a few appliances you're missing.' ""Believe me, a toaster means a lot more when your heart's broken than on your wedding day,"" says Michon, a writer, who recently organized a divorce registry at Target for another friend.

"Cairo, Egypt (CNN) -- Groups of U.S. tourists were stuck Saturday trying to find their way out of Egypt amid the chaos and violent protests that have seized the country. American traveler Diane Kelley of Chicago described being ""stranded"" near the Cairo airport with her husband, Gaynor, and 14 other tourists, all waiting for departing flights. ""We've had so far two flights canceled and we're currently just waiting to see if we can get out of Cairo to any other place in the world, but it's very chaotic here,"" Kelley told CNN by phone, adding they are afraid for their safety if they go outside. The father of one of their Egyptian guides was shot as the group, traveling with U.S. tour company Abercrombie & Kent, made their way to the airport, Kelley said. They don't know the man's condition, she said. Gunshots could be heard in the streets, she said. ""I don't think anybody really feels 100 percent safe, but I think that we're much safer than the people who are in downtown Cairo right now,"" she said. Kelley and others traveling with Abercrombie & Kent were staying at the Fairmont Heliopolis hotel close to the airport, Abercrombie spokeswoman Pamela Lassers told CNN. The company moved its travelers there from downtown Cairo so they could be ready for the first available flights out of the country, she said. Lassers couldn't give an exact number of people traveling with the company in Egypt, but she said 14 staff members were looking after the tourists and trying to book their air travel. Farther south in Luxor, the ancient Egyptian city on the banks of the Nile, another American tour group traveling with the hosts of the PBS show ""Grannies on Safari"" was waiting for their chance to leave Egypt. Show host Regina Fraser and 13 others had intended to spend a few days touring museums and attractions sandwiched around a four-day Nile River cruise. Instead, since arriving Wednesday, they've found themselves navigating the chaos while trying to salvage something of their journey. ""There is no place you can feel 100 percent safe,"" Fraser said. Fraser's tour group had been scheduled to visit one of Cairo's main museums Friday, but it was closed because of concerns about protests, she said. Instead, someone suggested they visit Alexandria -- so they drove two hours only to be told to turn around and head immediately back to Cairo. Arriving back in the capital, they knew things were getting serious because thousands of people were in the streets, Fraser told CNN. The group's tour bus driver had trouble finding a route to the central Cairo hotel where they were staying. They finally found a route, but were stopped at a gate. ""We looked up and there were just hundreds of people running towards us. We could see tear gas had been dispersed. We were really concerned,"" she said. They were allowed to enter before the crowd arrived, but they had to get off the bus and walk the rest of the way to their hotel, Fraser said. The situation soon deteriorated, Fraser said. She said members of the tour group could hear gunfire popping and people yelling outside the hotel. One of the tourists, a freelance photographer, went outside to take pictures and saw bloodied people and at least one body, she said. The hotel shut down elevators and asked people to stay in their rooms, but from balconies the tourists could see the thousands of people massing in the streets, she said. By morning, when another bus came to pick them up for a flight to Luxor, where they were to board a ship for their cruise, the situation had turned eerily calm, Fraser said. ""We saw tank after tank after tank after tank, all lined up,"" she said. ""Then I think even our experienced travelers knew this was something more than your usual protests."" Fraser said tension was also beginning to build in Luxor, where she saw some streets being blocked off and a tank. The tour group boarded their ship on Saturday, but are trying to contact the American consulate on Sunday for advice. The mood on board is quiet and somber, she said. And the group is looking to cut their trip short by at least two days. ""I feel safer on this boat at this moment than I did this morning in Cairo,"" Fraser said. ""But when we get back to Cairo, we just want to get out."" The U.S. State Department has issued a travel alert urging tourists to avoid Egypt because of dangerous conditions.

"(CNN) -- Since the summer of 2010, Julian Assange has become a pop culture fixture, a self-appointed champion of free speech, the suspect in a Swedish sex crimes investigation and a man who says he's keeping afloat a financially strapped Web operation that has mightily ticked off the U.S. government. Some loathe him. Others admire him. But one thing is certain: Assange is not going away, no matter what happens in the ongoing legal case against him. Assange lost his appeal before Britain's Supreme Court on Wednesday, taking him another step closer to extradition to Sweden for questioning on sexual abuse accusations filed against him in August 2010. He's been living in England under house arrest related to the case and has failed several times in recent months to convince magistrates and the court of appeal that a warrant for his arrest is invalid. Assange has repeatedly stressed that he's innocent. His lawyers have vowed to take the fight all the way to the European Court of Human Rights if necessary. Though Assange is a household name now, little was known about him before July 25, 2010, when he dominated breaking international headlines when his site WikiLeaks published a trove of classified U.S. documents about the Afghanistan war. Until then, Assange had done few interviews and had kept a low profile. One exception, however, was a TED talk conducted just days earlier in which he described his upbringing as constantly uprooted, and said that his parents were in the movie business and on the run from a cult. The audience at the TED event seemed rapt. They laughed and clapped at his comments. When Assange founded WikiLeaks in 2006, the site built a relatively small but steady following among investigative journalists. WikiLeaks cut its teeth in its early years leaking information that exposed corruption in Kenya and information about the Guantanamo detention facility in Cuba, and his talk at TED concentrated mostly on those experiences. Even after more than a year and a half of drama involving Assange and WikiLeaks, some still consider Assange a journalist. For the past year, he has been living in a remote manor house called Ellingham Hall, north of London. The home belongs to Vaughan Smith, a former British soldier and journalist who runs a popular London gathering spot for reporters. Assange was a kind of nomad before his house arrest, numerous accounts and interviews he's given suggest. Ellingham has provided shelter for him from most media. He's given very few interviews in the past year, except for an hour-long talk with ""60 Minutes"" from the estate that aired on January 30, 2011. Over the months since his initial arrest in the Sweden case, Assange has repeatedly said that he's innocent of the allegations and that they are a ruse to get him for leaking the classified U.S. documents. In 2010, WikiLeaks posted online 391,832 classified documents on the Iraq war and more than 90,000 classified documents on the Afghan war. WikiLeaks has also released about a quarter-million diplomatic cables -- communication between the U.S. State Department and diplomatic outposts around the globe. Assange gave an interview to Germany's Der Spiegel in 2010, explaining the decision to publish the Afghanistan war documents. ""This material shined a light on the everyday brutality and squalor of war,"" he said. Assange continued in interviews over several months with Time magazine, CNN and other media outlets to insist that leaking the classified documents served a greater public good. Instant fame . With the Afghanistan war leak, Assange became a household name nearly overnight. Every news outlet in the world was reporting the story and flashing pictures of his snow-white hair, skinny ties and sardonic smile. Some said he was a cheerleader of transparency and a defender of the public's right to know. Others said he was a foe of the United States and its allies, and had endangered confidential intelligence informants whose names appeared in an initial batch of the WikiLeaks documents. U.S. Rep. Peter King, R-New York, called Assange an ""enemy combatant."" When Assange was arrested in relation to the sexual assault allegations, then-U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates told reporters, ""It sounds like good news to me."" Yet Assange stepped further into the fray. In late 2010, Assange said that Secretary of State Hillary Clinton ""should resign"" when responding to a question by Time magazine concerning the diplomatic cable dump. At the same time, Assange's influence and star power grew. Time's readers voted him Person of the Year for 2010. Despite the ongoing sex crimes case, for which he was temporarily jailed (a detention that ""Saturday Night Live"" spoofed), Assange insisted that WikiLeaks was still operating. On September 2, 2011, WikiLeaks released its entire archive of the diplomatic cables -- 251,287 unredacted documents. An unauthorized biography of Assange, which he has fiercely criticized, was also released in September. According to several reports, British newspaper The Independent published what it said were portions of the book. In one section, Assange is quoted as saying, ""I did not rape those women."" On November 28, Assange addressed journalists at a News World Summit in Hong Kong via a video link from England. For at least 30 minutes, he went on a rant criticizing Washington, mainstream media, banks and others, while accepting an award from a noted journalism group, the Walkley Foundation of Australia. He said that a federal grand jury in Washington was investigating WikiLeaks and that people and companies around the world were coerced to testify against the group. He accused banks of blockading WikiLeaks, said that journalists have become ladder climbers and must be held to greater account, and said there was a ""new McCarthyism"" in the United States. Also last year, Assange won the 2011 Martha Gellhorn Prize for Journalism, and a Norwegian parliamentarian nominated him for the Nobel Peace Prize. The latest proof that Assange is certifiably pop is news that he voiced his own character for the 500th episode of ""The Simpsons"" which aired earlier this year. He recorded the spot last summer. In March, Assange hosted a new talk show on English-language Russian television. Called ""The World Tomorrow,"" it features him interviewing ""key political players, thinkers and revolutionaries."" From hacking to WikiLeaking . While Julian Assange's public persona grows stronger, his mother, Christine Assange, said that his ordeal is taking a toll on her family. She told ABC Brisbane this week that her son's battle against extradition to Sweden is a ""political frame-up."" She also said her cell phone is being monitored, according to the International Business Times. Yet Christine Assange has been her son's biggest defender. She has in the past described him as ""highly intelligent."" He was just 16 when she bought him a Commodore 64 computer in 1987. Assange attached a modem to his computer and began his journey into the new computer era. ""It's like chess,"" he told New Yorker magazine. ""Chess is very austere in that you don't have many rules, there is no randomness and the problem is very hard."" Though his mother raised him without any religious influence, she sensed that from a tender age, her son was led by a strong desire to do what he perceived as just. ""He was a lovely boy, very sensitive, good with animals, quiet and has a wicked sense of humor,"" she's told the Melbourne, Australia, Herald Sun. Assange studied mathematics and physics at the University of Melbourne. In interviews, Assange speaks in baritone. His pace is measured, and he seems to choose words carefully. He can be charming yet cagey about his private life and is rarely shaken by discussions of even the most controversial revelations on WikiLeaks. He's the kind of person who, he says, can hack into the most sophisticated computer system. But he can forget to show up for an interview or cancel at the last minute. When he talks, he displays an astonishing breadth of interests: from computers to literature to his travels in Africa. Assange's fascination with hacking grew when he was a teen. He taught himself computer encryption and security. He says he once set up an encryption puzzle based on the manipulation of prime numbers. A June 2010 New Yorker article describes how Assange hacked into the master terminal of the telecom company Nortel in 1991. The profile also says that Assange married and had a child when he was 18, but the relationship fell apart and his wife left him with their infant son. The young hacker eventually turned away from network flaws and focused on what he perceived as wrongdoings of governments. An activist, journalist or both? This statement appeared in 2007 on the blog IQ.org, which Assange is believed to have created. ""The whole universe or the structure that perceives it is a worthy opponent, but try as I may I can not escape the sound of suffering. Perhaps as an old man I will take great comfort in pottering around in a lab and gently talking to students in the summer evening and will accept suffering with insouciance. But not now; men in their prime, if they have convictions are tasked to act on them."" Among the myriad topics addressed on the blog, Assange discusses mathematics versus philosophy, the death of author Kurt Vonnegut, censorship in Iran and the corporation as a nation state. Driven by the conviction of an activist and the curiosity of a journalist, Assange founded WikiLeaks in 2006. He slept little and sometimes forgot to eat. He hired staff and enlisted the help of volunteers. Daniel Domscheit-Berg, a longtime volunteer and spokesman for WikiLeaks, was considered to be Assange's closest collaborator. He quit WikiLeaks and told CNN that Assange's personality was distracting from the group's original mission: to publish small leaks, not just huge, splashy ones like the Afghan War Diary. Domscheit-Berg went on to publish a tell-all book about the inner workings of WikiLeaks. He wrote that Assange is a ""paranoid, power-hungry, megalomaniac.""","Julian Assange is facing extradition to Sweden on allegations of sex crimes .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- As the first splinters of sunlight spread their warmth on the south bank of the River Thames on Thursday, it became clear that after more than a century, the vision of Victorian engineer Alexander Stanhope St. George had finally been realized. The Telectroscope lets Londoners and New Yorkers see each other in real time. In all its optical brilliance and brass and wood, there stood the Telectroscope: an 11.2-meter-(37 feet) long by 3.3-meter-(11 feet) tall dream of a device allowing people on one side of the Atlantic to look into its person-size lens and, in real time, see those on the other side via a recently completed tunnel running under the ocean. (Think 19th-century Webcam. Or maybe Victorian-age video phone.) And all the credit goes to British artist Paul St. George. If he had not been rummaging through great-grandpa Alexander's personal effects a few years ago, the Telectroscope might still exist only on paper, hidden away deep inside some old box. But fortunately, St. George could not bear that thought and thus decided he should be the one to finish what his great-grandfather had started. It was quite simply the right thing to do. Plus, it would make a pretty cool public art exhibit. Send us your videos, images or stories . During the twilight hours Tuesday, massive dirt-covered metal drill bits miraculously emerged -- one by the Thames near the Tower Bridge and the other on Fulton Ferry Landing by the Brooklyn Bridge in New York -- completing the final sections of great-grandfather Alexander's transatlantic tunnel. The drills were removed Wednesday night and replaced with identical Telectroscopes at both ends, allowing Londoners and New Yorkers to wake up Thursday, look over to the far and distant shore and stare at each other for a while (the telescope-like contraption permits visual but not vocal communication). Of course, only part of this story is true. St. George is an artist in Britain who does have a grandfather -- minus the great prefix -- named Alexander. And the trans-Atlantic tunnel is really a trans-Atlantic broadband network rounded off on each end with HD cameras, according to Tiscali, an Italian Internet provider handling the technical side of the project. As for the Telectroscope, well, it was a fanciful idea that, according to St. George, came about from a typo made by a 19th-century reporter who misspelled Electroscope, a device used to measure electrostatic charges - as Telectroscope. ""The journalist also misunderstood what it was about and wrote in the article that it was a device for the suppression of absence,"" St. George said. ""The accidental hope captured their imagination, and lots of people at the end of the 19th century thought it was a great idea."" The Telectroscope captured St. George's imagination five years ago, when he began pondering how to do a project on the childhood fantasy of digging a hole to the opposite side of the Earth. And because the artist also happens to have an expertise in Victorian chronophotography -- a precursor to cinematography -- he had a slight idea of where to look for the proper equipment. ""We all have that idea in our head if we could make a tunnel to the other side of the Earth,"" St. George said.""But we are not all crazy enough to actually try and do it."" St. George was crazy enough to actually try and do it, but he realized he could not do the digging alone. So about two years ago, he pitched the idea to Artichoke, the British arts group responsible for taking the Sultan's Elephant -- a 42-ton mechanical creature -- for a stroll through central London in 2006. The company was immediately taken by St. George's idea. ""The whole thing is about seeing what is real and what isn't real and how the world is,"" said Nicki Webb, a co-founder of Artichoke. ""Is it nighttime when we are in daytime, and does it look familiar to us or not?"" When the sun illuminated the lens of the Telectroscope next to the Thames, it was, of course, still nighttime in New York. So the screen inside the scope broadcast back only an empty sidewalk silently framed by the Brooklyn Bridge and the Manhattan skyline. But then something miraculous occurred. A police officer and a street cleaner walked into the frame. Stopped. And waved. The Telectroscope will be on display and open to the public 24 hours a day in London and New York until June 15. Artichoke is arranging requests to synchronize special reunions between friends and family or, the company hopes, maybe even a marriage proposal.","Telectroscope allows Londoners, New Yorkers to see each other in real time .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- How does the American public feel about the war in Afghanistan? In a word, wary. U.S. forces have been engaged in fierce fighting to oust the Taliban in Afghanistan. President Obama on Friday announced his strategy to fight terrorism in Afghanistan and Pakistan, a plan that includes more troops, new legislation, improved troop training and added civilian expertise. ""The United States of American did not choose to fight a war in Afghanistan. Nearly 3,000 of our people were killed on September 11, 2001,"" Obama said Friday. ""We have a clear and focused goal: to disrupt, dismantle and defeat al Qaeda in Pakistan and Afghanistan,"" he said. Stressing that ""the safety of people around the world is at stake,"" Obama said the ""situation is increasingly perilous"" in the region in and around Afghanistan, where the United States has been fighting al Qaeda and the Taliban for more than 7Â½ years after attacks in New York and at the Pentagon. Nevertheless, the American public has been wary about the war in Afghanistan, according to a CNN/Opinion Research Corp. poll conducted in February.  Watch CNN's Bill Schneider break down the numbers Â» . Last month, Americans were almost evenly divided between those who support the war and those who oppose it, the poll showed, with 47 percent in favor and 51 percent opposed. Opposition to the war in Afghanistan is more muted than opposition to the war in Iraq, but it's not so muted among Democrats. Two-thirds of Americans overall oppose the war in Iraq, but 64 percent of Democrats oppose the war in Afghanistan. The anti-war movements in Vietnam and Iraq helped define what the Democratic Party stands for.  Watch: Is Afghanistan Obama's Vietnam? Â» . ""If we don't learn from our Iraq experience, we are doomed to repeat it,"" Rep. Lynn Woolsey, D-California, said on the House floor Thursday. Why are Americans wary about Afghanistan? The recession. Iraq War fatigue. And frustration. Only 31 percent of Americans believe the United States is winning the war in Afghanistan. Fifty percent believe the United States is winning in Iraq -- the highest number in at least five years. But Americans still want to get out of Iraq. Last month, when President Obama said he would send 17,000 more U.S. troops to Afghanistan, the public was willing to give him the benefit of the doubt. Democrats were willing to go along with the president, but they were less enthusiastic than Republicans . A solid majority of Americans believe the United States can win a military victory in Afghanistan, but Afghanistan has become a political war. Winning depends, not just on what the United States can do, but also what Afghanistan and Pakistan can do. Americans have far less confidence in them. The CNN/Opinion Research Corp. poll surveyed 1,046 adult Americans by telephone on February 18-19, 2009. The sampling error is plus or minus three percentage points.","Americans almost evenly divided on opinion of Afghanistan war, poll shows .

"(CNN) -- A Russian bookmaking company is offering to pay 100,000 euros for Paul, the prognosticating octopus who correctly predicted Spain's win in the World Cup. ""100,000 euros (about $129,800) was our starting price,"" Oleg Zhuravsky, co-owner of Liga Stavok -- ""Bet League"" in Russian -- told CNN. He said the offer could be increased if need be -- ""We are bookmakers, after all."" Paul currently lives at the Sea Life Center in Oberhausen, Germany. Zhuravsky said a representative of the center's public relations firm has told him the offer has been received and ""they are studying it."" However, the firm, Dederichs Reinecke and Parner, said it declined the Russian offer and that Paul will not be sold to anyone. ""Seriously speaking, we want the octopus for a number of purposes,"" Zhuravsky said. ""First, to see whether he can indeed effectively forecast the results of the football games. Secondly, Paul could become a good mascot, a good symbol for my bookmaking companies. And thirdly, he has an international fame like perhaps no other animal across the world does these days, and I'd love to be able to move him to Russia. ""Both kids and adults, I'm sure, would love to see him here,"" he said. ""We are even prepared to put him in the Moscow City Aquarium if that were the condition."" He said Paul would be given ""the best food"" and officials would let him forecast the results of the Russian domestic football tournament, ""which, I think, is a more difficult task than predicting the World Cup,"" he said. ""This would also boost the profile of the Moscow Aquarium."" ""They said they'll respond to our offer this week,"" said Zhuravsky, who is also president of the Russian Association of Bookmakers. ""They didn't tell us that they're not selling the octopus."" Last week, the Madrid, Spain, aquarium said it was making the ""necessary arrangements"" for Paul's transfer to Spain but had offered to beat any offer already on the table. Paul not only predicted Spain's win over the Netherlands in the final but also the team's semifinal success against Germany. Prior to that, the cephalopod correctly predicted all five of Germany's earlier results, and picked Germany to beat Uruguay in the third-place playoff, ending the tournament with a remarkable eight-for-eight record. For each prediction, two mussel-filled acrylic boxes labeled with a team's flag were lowered into Paul's tank. Whichever box he chose conveyed the winning team. Sea Life staff have announced Paul is retiring from the predictions game, but previously said they were considering a ""host of offers from around the globe."" Public relations guru Max Clifford told CNN that Paul could become the world's first multimillionaire octopus if his handlers choose to cash in on his global fame. CNN's Maxim Tkachenko and Lianne Turner contributed to this report.","Company says 100,000 euros is its starting price .

"Naval Air Facility El Centro, California (CNN) -- Britain's Prince Harry, the younger son of Prince Charles, has arrived at a U.S. military base in California for the final phase of helicopter gunship training, according to a United Kingdom Ministry of Defense statement Friday. Capt. Harry Wales, as he's known on the airfield, will begin live-fire training, which is combined with ""environmental and judgment training."" The course will be split between Naval Air Facility El Centro and Gila Bend Air Force Auxiliary Air Field in Arizona. If he passes the two months of pilot training, Prince Harry will be one step closer to becoming combat ready and possibly returning to the front lines of Afghanistan, where the majority of pilots and crews successfully completing the Apache helicopter training are deployed, said British Army Lt. Col. Peter Bullen. His training space is a bit famous, too: The El Centro base, which is in California's Imperial Valley about 110 miles east of San Diego and just minutes north of the Mexican border, is the winter home of the U.S. Navy's Blue Angels. It is also where much of the film ""Top Gun"" with Tom Cruise was filmed, said U.S. Navy Capt. Devon Jones, commanding officer. The helicopter exercises will require the group of 20 British airmen to use all the lessons they have learned in the past 14 months of their training, Bullen said. If successful, the prince and his mates will be deemed ""limited combat ready"" and will have four to six months more of training in England before they are considered fully combat ready, depending on their squadron's schedule, Bullen said. Prince Harry -- the younger son of Prince Charles, the heir to the British throne, and the late Princess Diana -- served on the front line in Afghanistan as a forward air controller and saw combat. But he was withdrawn in February 2008 after news of his deployment broke. His brother, Prince William, is also in the military, as an army officer. But as second in line for the throne, he is specifically barred from combat. According to the Telegraph in London, Prince Harry intends to return to Afghanistan next year after he completes his training. He has been told by flying instructors he has a ""natural flair"" for flying, the newspaper reported this summer. The British military, which has been training airmen at El Centro for the past 20 years, chose the American Southwest for the attack helicopter training because the mountainous desert and fine dust resemble conditions that U.S. and U.K. sorties now experience overseas. ""The environment here is certainly what you encounter in Afghanistan. You can't replicate that in England,"" Bullen said. The Exercise Crimson Eagle has been held several times at the El Centro base since 2006, most recently from March to May this year, Bullen said. The tactical exercises will test the fighting awareness of the prince and his 19 classmates. The El Centro instruction will focus on aviation environmental training and crew judgment. The students will be tested on handling the aircraft in mountainous and desert conditions, including dust landings and desert landings by day and night. ""We'll have guys on the ground acting as civilians or the enemy, and they'll have to use their judgment,"" Bullen said. In the second month of training, the two-man helicopter crews will use live fire on the Barry M. Goldwater Air Force Range complex at the Gila Bend Air Force Auxiliary Field in southern Arizona. They will deploy the Apache's weapons system: missiles, rockets and cannon. ""We'll have friendly troops that will indicate a target, and they will have to engage it,"" Bullen said. ""This is the first time they will fire armaments outside of simulators. ""The aircraft will be heavy and will have to be flown sympathetically,"" Bullen added about the British Apache MK 1 helicopter, which is a modified version of the American military's Apache. Jones said that Prince Harry won't receive any special treatment on the base. ""We will treat him as we do all our visiting British personnel,"" he told reporters. Added Bullen about the prince: ""He is treated exactly the same as any other student on the course, and he wouldn't want to be treated any differently."" Upon completion of Exercise Crimson Eagle, Prince Harry will return to Britain as a fully trained Apache pilot and will then be assigned to one of the Apache squadrons within 16 Air Assault Brigade, where he will gain more experience flying the attack helicopter and participate in exercises in the United Kingdom, the British military said. The British Apache force, which is operated by that country's Army Air Corps, is based in Wattisham, Suffolk, in England, and has been active in Afghanistan the past five years, officials said. The force also provided support recently in Libya. Wattisham Airfield was used by the U.S. Army Air Forces during World War II, officials said. CNN's Phil Gast and David Ariosto contributed to this report.","Prince Harry arrives at a U.S. military base in California .

"Seoul, South Korea (CNN) -- On the surface, Seoul, the capital of economic powerhouse South Korea, is one of the most impressive cities in East Asia: Sprawling and prosperous, hi-tech and self confident. But eight times a year, the traffic comes to a halt and crowds disappear from the streets as an eerie wail resounds across the city: The sound is a siren, and this is the minbangui, or civil defense exercise, designed to drill the population against a possible strike. Seoul is a metropolis that lives in the gun sights of North Korea, one of the most dangerous states on the planet and just 40 miles (64 kilometers) north of downtown, yet Seoul residents have learned to live with the threat. In recent years, North Korean provocations -- nuclear tests, missile firings, naval clashes -- have been more a subject for conversation in barbeque restaurants and late night pubs than lifestyle changers. Financial markets are barely moved by the latest threats; nobody is digging bunkers among their backyard kimchi pots. A blasÃ© attitude has infiltrated the public consciousness after six decades of living with the North. On Tuesday that attitude was rudely shaken after North Korean shells slammed into the South Korean island of Yeonpyong in the Yellow Sea. The sight of columns of smoke rising from an artillery strike sent a frisson of real fear through this city of 12 million. It was the first such attack since the Korean War ended at midnight, July 27, 1953, and Seoul itself lies in range of massed, long-range North Korean artillery dug into the Demilitarized Zone. Streets were jammed with traffic, as the news broke and people headed home to join families. Companies sent emails urging staff to remain calm. A European diplomatic dinner was half empty, as invited government officials on stage two alert -- one being the lowest level, four being war footing -- were obliged to remain at their stations. ""When I got home, the family discussed what we would do if war breaks out,"" said Kim Joon-hee, a Seoul-based accountant and mother of two. ""This was especially shocking as it came after the Cheonan incident."" In March, the Cheonan, a South Korea warship, was sunk in the Yellow Sea with the loss of 46 lives, indicating a dangerous new level of aggression by North Korea. The isolated state is currently in the midst of a leadership succession process. In the words of North Korean expert Dr Andrei Lankov, incoming leader Kim Jong Un has to prove to his generals that, ""...he is not a spoiled brat who spent his childhood eating Swiss pastries, but a tough leader -- a warlord in the making."" That was certainly the impression Seoul residents got on Tuesday. ""I had never seen South Korean buildings burning like that -- this was Iraq on Yeonpyong,"" said Sue Kim, a reporter at a leading daily. ""It was kind of incredible, but then my reaction was this has been going on for half a century. I had forgotten that we live in a country at war."" The Korean War, which ended with a truce rather than a peace treaty, is a distant memory for most Seoulites: few know the details of the savage street combat that racked their city, or the fact that the capital changed hands four times. The only remaining signs of combat are the bullet and shrapnel damage in the masonry of ancient palaces, for most of the city has been built and rebuilt. It is easy for the younger generation to overlook these scars, and the prominent U.S. military garrison -- headquarters of the 27,500 U.S. troops still stationed here as insurance against another invasion -- at Yongsan in the very heart of Seoul, is now an established part of the cityscape. And whether the Cheonan and Yeonpyongdo incidents will permanently change attitudes is uncertain. ""Normally when the North Koreans misbehave, people don't care, but yesterday, people got nervous,"" said Robert Koehler, a 13-year expatriate and author of a Seoul guidebook. ""People tend to get very angry, but then they settle down -- it is easy to get jaded."" But with the memories of one of the century's most devastating wars seared into their memories, the old generation cannot forget. ""For me this is nothing new,"" said Kim Song-hwan, a retired artist who lived through -- and painted -- the North Korean occupation of Seoul in 1950. ""But it is kind of problematic that young people today are unconcerned about the danger of war."" The 20th century Korean War lasted three years and killed -- estimates vary -- between two and four million. A 21st century Korean War is likely to be shorter but, with Pyongyang possessing nuclear weapons, even deadlier. And while Seoul in 1950 was a city that few people in the wider world had heard of, modern Seoul has tremendous international relevance as the capital of the world's 13th largest economy. Were it to come under artillery or nuclear attack, the tsunami that would sweep through global financial markets could be devastating.","Although no strangers to North Korean hostility, Seoul residents see this attack as different .

"London (CNN) -- UK food safety officials have ordered the testing of all beef products following the discovery of horsemeat in beef lasagna sold by UK firm Findus, only weeks after many meat lovers were dismayed to learn horse and pig DNA had been found in burgers. Testing revealed between 60% and 100% horsemeat in samples of the Findus lasagna, food inspectors in the United Kingdom and Ireland said. More: Horsemeat found in hamburgers in Britain and Ireland . Findus said it had withdrawn its lasagna -- labeled with the British spelling, ""lasagne"" -- from stores Monday as a precaution after its French supplier, Comigel, raised concerns about the type of meat used. Meanwhile, Findus France has temporarily withdrawn three ready-prepared dishes -- lasagna bolognese, shepherd's pie and moussaka -- because of the discovery of horsemeat in purported 100% beef products, the firm said. The company added, however, that the three products could still be eaten without health risk. The latest discovery in the United Kingdom comes less than a month after the Food Safety Authority of Ireland found that 10 out of 27 hamburger products it analyzed in a study contained horse DNA, while 23 of them tested positive for pig DNA. In nine out of the 10 burger samples, the horse DNA was found at very low levels, the inspectors said, but in one sample from Tesco, Britain's largest retailer, the horse meat accounted for about 29% of the burger. The revelation prompted the withdrawal of millions of burgers from supermarket shelves. The uproar over dubious processed meat has international ramifications, with companies in Poland and France involved as well as some in the United Kingdom and Ireland. Referring to the horsemeat controversy, British Prime Minister David Cameron tweeted: ""this is completely unacceptable - this isn't about food safety but about proper food labeling (and) confidence in retailers,"" according to his press office's Twitter account. In the wake of the Findus discovery, the chief executive of the Food Standards Agency, Catherine Brown, said UK firms must test all their beef products by next Friday. ""The FSA is now requiring a more robust response from the food industry in order to demonstrate that the food it sells and serves is what it says it is on the label,"" she said. Read more: Horse: Coming soon to a meat case near you? ""We are demanding that food businesses conduct authenticity tests on all beef products, such as beef burgers, meatballs and lasagne, and provide the results to the FSA. The tests will be for the presence of significant levels of horse meat."" In Sweden, the nation's three largest food retailers have withdrawn packaged lasagna suspected of containing horsemeat from their shelves, the press secretary of the Swedish National Food Agency told CNN Friday. Lukas Linne said the agency is monitoring the retailers' withdrawal of these items in accordance with Swedish labeling laws, which stipulate that packaged food can only contain what is marked on the label. Linne did not identify the supplier or suppliers that provided the produce to retailers. While horsemeat itself is not considered a food safety risk, its unauthorized use in certain products has raised concerns it could contain the veterinary drug phenylbutazone, or ""bute,"" commonly used to treat horses. Meat from animals treated with phenylbutazone is not allowed to enter the food chain as it may pose a risk to human health. Findus has been ordered to test the lasagna withdrawn from the shelves for the drug's presence. The Food Safety Authority of Ireland said Friday that the affected Findus lasagna had also been sold in Ireland. It urged consumers not to eat them, but to return the product to the store. Findus issued a statement Thursday saying it is confident it has fully resolved the ""supply chain issue"" that led to the discovery of horsemeat in its lasagna. Neigh it ain't so: Burger King finds horse meat at European supplier . ""We understand this it is a very sensitive subject for consumers and we would like to reassure you we have reacted immediately. We do not believe this to be a food safety issue,"" the firm said. ""Fully compliant beef lasagne will be in stores again soon."" CNN has reached out to Comigel France but has not yet had a response. Horsemeat is generally considered taboo in Britain, although it is commonly eaten in neighboring France and other countries, including China, Russia, Kazakhstan and Italy. The discovery of pig DNA in beef products is of particular concern to Jews and Muslims, whose dietary laws proscribe the consumption of pig products. Jewish dietary laws also ban the eating of horsemeat. The Justice Ministry confirmed last week that a number of meat pies and similar items supplied to prisons in England and Wales were labeled and served as halal -- prepared in compliance with Islamic dietary law -- but contained traces of pork DNA, the Food Standards Agency said. ""This is an unacceptable situation and people have a right to expect that the food they are eating is correctly described,"" the agency said. The furor over the Findus lasagna prompted humor as well as outrage on Twitter. ""If you think the Findus Lasagnes are bad, you should try their Filly Cheese Steak,"" wrote James Martin, posting as @Pundamentalism. Comedian Adam Hills, posting as @adamhillscomedy, joked: ""Those horses wanted to be uncovered in British Lasagne. Even the brand was called Findus.""

"(CNN) -- President Barack Obama campaigned in America's car country on Monday after his administration filed a trade complaint against China's auto industry subsidies, while Republican challenger Mitt Romney complained the move was ""too little, too late."" Romney spoke Monday to the U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce in his attempt to diminish the president's advantage with the Latino vote, a traditionally Democratic demographic that strongly supported Obama in 2008. With the November election just over seven weeks away, Obama seeks to maintain the momentum of a perceived ""bounce"" in support following this month's Democratic National Convention while Romney wants to gain ground on his rival ahead of the three presidential debates next month. Romney makes push for Hispanic voters . In speeches at Eden Park in Cincinnati and Schiller Park in Columbus, Obama focused on the auto sector that, according to industry research, supports almost 800,000 jobs in Ohio. The president touted both the auto industry bailout from his first year in office, noting Romney at the time called for letting Detroit go bankrupt on its own, and his administration's new complaint with the World Trade Organization that accuses China of providing $1 billion in illegal subsidies to auto and auto parts exporters between 2009 and 2011. ""You can talk a good game, but I like to walk the walk, not just talk the talk,"" Obama said of Romney, accusing the former Massachusetts governor of backing companies that outsourced U.S. jobs to China while a private equity investor. iReport: 'I'm the 47%, but you're wrong, Romney' ""We've brought more trade cases against China in one term than the previous administration did in two -- and every case we've brought that's been decided, we've won,"" Obama continued in Cincinnati, adding that the subsidies being challenged ""directly harm working men and women on the assembly line in Ohio and Michigan and across the Midwest."" His voice rising to a shout, Obama said to cheers: ""It's not right; it's against the rules; and we will not let it stand."" Critics of U.S. trade policy say a tougher line with China is necessary. Romney labeled the administration's move an election-year stunt in comparison to what he called his own consistent criticism of China as an unfair trade partner. ""The president may think that announcing new trade lawsuits less than two months from the election will distract from his record, but American businesses and workers struggling on an uneven playing field know better,"" Romney told the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce in Los Angeles. In an earlier statement, Romney said Obama ""has spent 43 months failing to confront China's unfair trade practices."" Romney ads paint plans to help middle class in broad strokes . The WTO is the global organization that referees trade disputes between nations. In the last decade, the Chinese auto industry has grown rapidly as the nation's expanding middle class made the country the world's largest market for car purchases, with General Motors now selling more cars in China than in the United States. According to White House estimates, up to 60% of China's auto parts exporters benefit from subsidies, making it hard for American companies to compete. U.S. Trade Representative Ron Kirk said in a statement on Monday that China agreed when it joined the WTO in 2001 to eliminate the kind of export subsidies targeted by the new U.S. complaint. Obama's mixed record on trade . Ohio is considered one of the most important battleground states of the November election, offering 18 electoral votes and the historical footnote that no Republican has ever won the presidency without carrying it. In his speech to the Hispanic businessmen, Romney touched on economic and education issues important to Latino communities. Obama's policies made things worse for Hispanic Americans, he said, citing higher unemployment and increased poverty compared to when the president took office. ""No one is exempt from the pain of this economy, but the Hispanic community has been particularly hard hit,"" Romney said. He offered some new details on his budget-cutting plans, saying he would save $500 billion by reducing government employment by 10% through attrition while combining agencies and departments to reduce overhead and linking government compensation to private sector levels. Romney also promised to ""permanently fix our immigration system,"" the latest in a series of attempts to appeal to Hispanic voters despite polls showing the Republican presidential nominee faces a sizable deficit among the key voting group. Opinion: Can Romney connect with Latino voters? Obama leads Romney among Latino registered voters by 64%-27%, according to a recent Gallup poll. Later this week, both candidates will separately answer questions from the Spanish-language television network Univision as part of outreach to Hispanic voters. Romney has struggled in the past to frame his positions on immigration in ways that appeal to Hispanic voters as well as the conservative base of the Republican Party. On Monday, he repeated past support for requiring employers to verify the legal status of workers and to simplify immigration laws while strengthening border security. He also reiterated his opposition to amnesty -- a code word for the DREAM Act proposed by Democrats and backed by Obama that would provide a path to legal status for children of illegal immigrants brought to America by their parents. At the same time, he expressed support for giving permanent residency to those who served in the military or obtained an advanced degree, and blasted Obama for failing to deliver on a 2008 campaign promise of immigration reform. ""Despite his party having majorities in both house of Congress, super majorities, the president never even offered up a bill,"" Romney said. ""Like so many issues confronting our nation, when it comes to immigration, politics have been put ahead of people for too long."" At a Republican presidential candidate debate in January, Romney said he favored a system of ""self-deportation,"" a policy that involves making economic conditions so difficult for undocumented workers that they choose to leave the country to find better opportunities. That stance was derided by Democrats and his Republican rivals. Romney retools campaign message . Obama's campaign released a web video on Monday denouncing Romney's ""Extreme Makeover, Latino Edition,"" claiming the candidate was attempting to ""overhaul his positions and slow his sharply declining popularity in the Latino community."" ""Can Romney cover up his belief in self-deportation as an immigration solution with a bold new wallpaper choice?"" Team Obama asks. ""Will a new window treatment help disguise his cuts to education and college scholarships? If he does something amazing with spackle, will people forget he's promised over and over again to repeal Obamacare on day one - denying millions of Latinos comprehensive health care coverage? And on his promise to veto the DREAM Act. ... well, duct tape can fix everything, can't it?"" On another issue, a new poll on Monday showed that more respondents favored Obama over Romney on their handling of anti-American unrest in Arab world countries. The Pew Research Center survey showed that 45% approved of Obama's handling of the attacks on U.S. embassies and diplomatic compounds while 36% disapproved, compared to 26% approving Romney's actions while 48% disapproved. Meanwhile, a pair of television ads released Monday by the Romney campaign focused on the nation's economy, which voters identify as their main issue of concern. In the first ad, Romney speaks interview-style about proposals he claims will help bolster earnings for middle income Americans and ultimately create 12 million new jobs before the end of a potential first term. The ad generally repeats Romney's main campaign themes on the economy without offering new details. The second ad on Monday features a narrator listing problems with the nation's economy since Obama took office. ""Barack Obama: More spending, more debt, failing American families,"" the ad says.

"(CNN) -- Blinded by balloons. Freaked out from funny hats. Overcome by confetti. The nonstop insanity that occurs every four years at presidential party conventions is a given. And next week's Democratic National Convention in Charlotte, North Carolina, is no exception. Convention-goers will need a break. Can you sneak away for an hour? Check out a free, self-guided walking tour of public art among the Uptown area's shining modern skyscrapers. After you download a map and an audio podcast, you're ready to hit the sidewalk. The starting point is at West Trade and Poplar streets, a stone's throw from the Time Warner Cable Arena convention hall. At Independence Square, you'll see four statues created by Pittsburgh's Raymond Kaskey -- representing commerce, industry, transportation and the future. Farther along the tour, you'll come across sculptures by British artist Shaun Cassidy. Outside the Bechtler Museum of Modern Art, take part in a tradition. Join countless others who've had their photo taken with the Firebird sculpture. The outdoor work stands 18 feet tall, and it's covered with thousands of tiles of mirrored glass. An hour might give you just enough time to see the US Airways plane that pilot Chesley ""Sully"" Sullenberger made famous in 2009. A bird strike forced Sullenberger to ditch the A320 Airbus with 155 passengers and crew in New York's Hudson River. No one was hurt, and the plane is now on display at the Carolinas Aviation Museum, a 15-minute drive from the Time Warner Cable Arena. There's a lot more to see at the museum, including two rare aircraft -- the D-558-1 Skystreak and a Savoia Marchetti S.56B -- so don't blame us if you end up taking more than an hour. Maybe you can steal a little more time -- a whole afternoon? If so, here's an idea that's perfect for the politics crowd: former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright's prized collection of jeweled pins. See more than 200 of them at the Mint Museum Uptown at 500 S. Tryon St., about a 15-minute walk from Time Warner Cable Arena. There's a funny story linked to these sparkly artifacts. Albright started collecting pins during rising tensions between the United States and Iraq, she told The Charlotte Observer. In 1994, when she was U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, the Iraqi press called her a ""serpent."" Albright turned that insult into a fashion statement. At her next meeting about Iraq, she sported a decorative golden brooch that looked like a snake. That's how Albright started her signature style of wearing jewelry to send not-so-subtle diplomatic signals. Another idea: Take a 10-minute drive from the convention hall and explore NoDa. This neighborhood's name comes from its location on North Davidson Street, where long ago, textile mills hummed with activity. Now the district buzzes with live music, trendy restaurants and funky coffeehouses. Take a seat inside the friendly Smelly Cat Coffeehouse near North Davidson and 36th streets. ""We have no idea necessarily what to expect,"" barista Leah Burleson says about possible convention traffic. The shop -- named after a ""terrible, terrible song"" sung by ""Friends"" TV character Phoebe Buffay boasts a new bean roaster that Burleson says sets it apart from the competition. NoDa also has another rarity: a 24-hour French bakery and cafe. The eclectic vibe at Amelie's is almost as memorable as its savory soups, sandwiches, cookies, pastries and cakes. Or take an hour and hit Lunchbox Records, an independent music shop that specializes in vinyl, CDs and DVDs. It's about a 10-minute drive from the arena, off Central Avenue in the trendy Plaza-Midwood neighborhood. Got kids? Consider an afternoon at Discovery Place, Discovery Place KIDS or Charlotte Nature Museum, offering a hands-on educational experience for the whole family. If you can swing an entire day? Would you be interested in seeing any of the following up close? Prince's purple guitar that he played at the 2007 Super Bowl. Malcolm X's personal Quran and diary in which he described his 1964 pilgrimage to Mecca. Serena Williams' tennis outfit that she wore when she won Wimbledon in 2009. Author Alex Haley's Smith Corona Coronet Electric typewriter that he used to write ""Roots."" Jimi Hendrix's black flair pants, purple top and crop vest. Astronaut Joan Higginbotham's space shuttle flight suit and helmet. They're all in one place: The Harvey B. Gantt Center for African-American Arts + Culture, a 15-minute walk from the arena. The museum's ""America I AM"" exhibit celebrates and documents five centuries of African-American history. Also within walking distance from the arena is the NASCAR Hall of Fame, where historic vehicles and impressive displays show off 60 years of stock car racing. About 15 miles from the convention hall is the world's largest man-made whitewater river. The U.S. National Whitewater Center offers more than 400 acres of outdoor action, including a zipline, kayaking, rafting, mountain biking and rock climbing. ""It's kind of a Disney World one-stop shop"" for outdoor activities, says spokesman Stephen Youngblade. If you're not into the action and just want to hang out for the day, the price is right: There's no general admission fee. Of course, plenty will be overnighting it . Experience a concert at NoDa's Neighborhood Theater, a historic cinema converted into one of Charlotte's beloved music venues. The theater's walls are decorated with beautiful, giant mural paintings. The convention week's events offer a mix of music and art. Check the theater's website for details. Finally, let's not forget shopping. Concord Mills, which boasts about 200 retail and outlet shops, is about a half-hour northeast of Charlotte. Another shopping mecca, SouthPark Mall -- about six miles south of the city's center -- offers high-end retailers such as Neiman Marcus and Nordstrom. Some of the region's best furniture manufacturers and outlets can be found an hour northwest of the city in Hickory, North Carolina, and an hour northeast in High Point. One word of advice, call ahead if you can. Many of these places are operating under special hours because of the convention. Hey, Charlotte natives, do you have any ideas for conventioneers?

"(CNN) -- A nasty collision during a kickoff in 1997 left Kevin Turner seeing stars. The former Philadelphia Eagles fullback, who spent eight seasons battering through defensive lines in the National Football League, said the hit left him wondering where he was. Still, the team's medical staff looked him over and eventually sent him back out to play, he said. ""The doctor looked in my eyes,"" Turner recalled in a statement delivered by his attorney in response to questions from CNN. ""He then told me to remember these words, either four or five simple, basic words."" But the task proved daunting. ""It was the weirdest thing ever and most frustrating because at the time I was clamoring to get back into the game,"" said Turner. ""I was really trying so hard. And I remember it being just the most frustrating thing ever."" By the second half, he'd remembered. ""I went back in the game after halftime and played the rest of the game,"" he added in the statement to CNN. A little over a decade later, the former Eagle is battling the debilitating effects of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, often known as ALS or Lou Gehrig's disease. He said his doctors have told him that ""there's no cure, you're going to die within two to 10 years, and get your affairs in order."" Since the diagnosis, Turner has lost most of the use of his hands and arms. He's also agreed to submit his brain to scientific study following his death. Whether Turner's disease, and those like it, can be linked to the consequences of repeated head trauma is the subject of growing research and the focus of mounting litigation against the NFL. Turner is one of hundreds of former NFL players and their families currently suing the league for alleged negligence, claiming that it didn't do enough to mitigate the risks despite what many say is an inherently dangerous sport. His attorney, Stephen F. Rosenthal -- whose Miami-based firm represents 137 other players and their families who've filed a class-action suit against the league -- said Turner has likely suffered from undiagnosed concussions. He accused the league of deliberately withholding information deemed critical to player safety. ""At no time did the NFL inform Plaintiff Turner that he risked severe and permanent brain damage by returning to play too soon after sustaining a concussion,"" the lawsuit states. ""The NFL's failure was a substantial cause of his current injuries."" Stars such as former quarterback Jim McMahon, as well as running backs Jamal Lewis and Dorsey Levens, have filed similar lawsuits in states across the country. Attorneys representing Lewis and Levens accuse the league of having used a ""hand-picked committee of physicians"" to misrepresent evidence of the effects of head trauma, particularly concussions. ""We do believe the NFL knew and had that available information with them for many years now,"" said attorney Mike McGlamry. The league denies the claims and released a statement saying it ""has long made player safety a priority and continues to take steps to protect players and to advance the science and medical understanding of the management and treatment of concussions."" ""The NFL has never misled players with respect to the risks associated with playing football,"" the statement added. ""Any suggestion to the contrary has no merit."" A spokesman for the Philadelphia Eagles, regarding Turner's allegations, referred CNN to the league's statement. On Sunday, the NFL is expected to air a multimillion-dollar commercial during the Super Bowl that details the history of the league and emphasizes player health and safety. The league has in recent years also made strides to strengthen rules that govern on-the-field conduct while adding sideline medical staff -- unaffiliated with the teams -- to more independently evaluate injured players. In 2005, the league banned the practice of tackling a player by using his shoulder pads, a move commonly referred to as a ""horse-collar"" tackle, after concluding it commonly resulted in injury. It also strengthened a 1979 rule prohibiting players from using their helmets to butt, or ""spear,"" players during a tackle -- a rule that critics often complained had lacked enforcement. Players like Steelers' linebacker James Harrison have since been dealt hefty and repeated fines for helmet-first tackles. Critics, meanwhile, say the league should have made the changes years ago and have called for more protections. Part of the issue, noted a former Atlanta Falcons linebacker, is a sports culture that largely encourages behavior out-of-step with the recognized risks of head trauma. It's exacerbated when coaches, even at the high school level, say ""'Oh, you just got your bell rung. Get back out there and play,'"" noted Coy Wire. That attitude, he added, can contribute to the risks of long-term brain damage. A recent study conducted at Boston University's Center for the Study of Traumatic Encephalopathy found evidence of a condition called chronic traumatic encephalopathy -- a dementia-like brain disease -- had been found in the brains of 14 of 15 former NFL players. Their cases shared a common thread -- repeated concussions, sub-concussive blows to the head, or both, according to the study. Many of those named in the recent claims, meanwhile, describe a range of common symptoms that include headaches, sleeplessness and dementia. But whether the league can be proven liable for alleged mistreatment of players, who often acknowledge the risks and likely also suffered head trauma during their high school and collegiate years, is expected to be the source of a drawn-out legal battle involving a growing number of plaintiffs. Still, family and friends close to the players are often left to deal with the gritty aftermath of day-to-day living once the bright lights of prime time fades. Teresa Foley, the wife of former New York Jets quarterback Glenn Foley, who is named in the class-action lawsuit, said she'd like to organize a support group. ""We're all going through the same thing,"" said Teresa Foley. ""It'd be great for all of us to be able to just sit down and talk together."" She says her husband, a 41-year-old New Jersey native selected in 1994 by the Jets, has faced bouts of depression and severe memory loss since his retirement from the league more than a decade ago. ""I sent him to the supermarket a couple of months ago with a list of a few things,"" said Teresa Foley. ""He went with the list. But he forgot what he had to get, and also forgot that he had a list."" The former quarterback returned home empty-handed. ""It's getting scary,"" she said. ""We had a conversation last night and he doesn't even remember it today. ""I just want some place where my husband can go to get help."" Part of the claim, the former players' attorneys say, would be used to establish a fund for former players. Earlier this week, a panel of judges ruled that mounting claims against the league -- including class-action lawsuits filed in New York, New Jersey, Florida, Georgia and California -- will be consolidated in a federal court in Philadelphia.","Former Philadelphia Eagles' fullback Kevin Turner confronts ALS .

"Seoul, South Korea (CNN) -- Park Geun-hye lived up to her nickname as the ""Queen of Elections"" after winning the race Wednesday to become South Korea's first female president. Park, 60, will return to the Blue House, the official residence for the nation's president, where she spent her formative years. She has admitted to taking inspiration from Britain's former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and Queen Elizabeth II. Throughout her campaign, Park used her gender in television campaign advertisements, signing off as ""the prepared female president."" On Wednesday night, Park smiled broadly, shook hands with supporters who chanted ""President Park Geun-hye,"" and pledged ""an era of happiness."" But as the daughter of former dictator Park Chung-hee, many see it impossible to separate her present from her past. Park Chung-hee seized power in a military coup in 1961 and ruled until he was assassinated by his spy chief in 1979. It is widely accepted he rebuilt the country from the ashes of the Korean War and sparked a dramatic economic transformation, but his methods split the country . He changed the constitution to cement power and cracked down on dissent and opposition. Though Park did hold and win a number of elections during his reign, he is also accused of human rights abuses and delaying the advent of democracy in South Korea. Earlier in the campaign, Park Geun-hye spent months defending her father's actions, insisting different times required different methods. But in September, she finally apologized to those hurt by his dictatorial rule. ""I understand that the end does not justify the means,"" she said. ""And this should be a lasting value for democracy."" North Korea holds little sway in South Korea's election . Her core support was among the over-50s, those who remember her father fondly as well as his economic policies that dragged the country out of poverty. His wife, Yuk Young-soo, remains to this day the most popular first lady South Korea has seen, according to polls. Known affectionately as ""mother of the nation,"" some supporters say Park resembles her mother with her frugal lifestyle and 1970s hairstyle. At a memorial service for her mother in August, she said she shares her mother's vision of a more equal society. ""It was my mother's dream, and her dream is now mine."" Both of her parents were killed during their time in the Blue House. Her mother was assassinated in 1974, killed by a botched North Korean attempt to kill her father. Park stepped in as first lady until her father's assassination in 1979. She then withdrew from public life. Being her father's daughter is a double-edged sword and one that Andrei Lankov of Kookmin University in Seoul says she cannot avoid: Will she be capable of challenging, deviating from the traditions of the heritage of her father, he asked. Park defeated liberal rival, Moon Jae-in, a former human rights activist, who was imprisoned during the 1970s for protesting against the regime of Park's father.

"SEOUL, South Korea (CNN) -- The United States said Tuesday it has backed a plan aimed at dismantling North Korea's nuclear facilities by the end of the year, The Associated Press reported. North Korean leader Kim Jong Il, left, welcomes South Korean President Roh Moo-hyun in Pyongyang. Six nations reached a tentative agreement in Beijing on Sunday but said the plan needed further consideration by their governments. The plan was to establish the steps to be taken in the denuclearization process for the remainder of the year, AP reported. ""We have conveyed to the Chinese government our approval for the draft statement. All the parties went back to their capitals. We studied it, examined it, gave our approval to the Chinese. I can't speak to the status of all the other countries,"" State Department Spokesman Sean McCormack said, according to AP. He declined to comment on specifics of the agreement. Negotiators have been working to move forward an agreement made in February under which the countries agreed to give North Korea 1 million tons of heavy fuel oil, or the monetary equivalent in other aid and assistance, according to AP. North Korea in return agreed to shut down its main nuclear reactor, which it did in July, and declare and ultimately dismantle all its nuclear programs, AP reported. Last year, North Korea tested a nuclear bomb, rattling regional stability and leading to a dramatic turnaround in a previously hard-line U.S. policy. On the eve of this week's summit, South Korean President Roh Moo-hyun told graduating military cadets that his goal is to secure peace on the Korean peninsula. Roh acknowledged that ridding the North of nuclear weapons and establishing a peace treaty could not be realized by the two Koreas alone. But he said he would work to establish a concrete agreement on ""building military trust and addressing humanitarian matters."" Earlier Tuesday, North Korean leader Kim Jong Il greeted Roh in Pyongyang to begin the second summit between the two countries since the peninsula's division after World War II. Thousands of cheering North Koreans and a military honor guard bearing rifles with bayonets heralded the leaders' first encounter outside a cultural hall in the North Korean capital, where Roh traveled 3Â½ hours by road from the South Korean capital, Seoul. The two leaders shook hands, but the only words exchanged were a mutual ""glad to meet you."" Neither made any public comment before Roh got back into his armored limousine to travel to the state guesthouse where he is staying for the summit, which runs through Thursday.  Watch Roh say what he wants to achieve with this summit Â» . Roh later attended a welcoming dinner hosted by North Korea's second most senior leader, Kim Yong-nam, president of the Presidium of the Supreme People's Assembly. Kim Jong Il did not attend the dinner. Earlier, Roh symbolically walked across the North's border, pledging to foster peace on the divided peninsula. Roh became the first leader from either side to cross the border on foot. ""This line is a wall that has divided the nation for a half-century. Our people have suffered from too many hardships and development has been held up due to this wall,"" Roh said, crossing near the North Korean city of Kaesong. ""This line will be gradually erased and the wall will fall,"" he said. ""I will make efforts to make my walk across the border an occasion to remove the forbidden wall and move toward peace and prosperity."" The three-day meeting in Pyongyang will mark the first extended appearance of the enigmatic, authoritarian Kim before the world since the two Koreas' only other summit in June 2000. But Tuesday's meeting contrasted with the 2000 summit, when Kim warmly greeted the then South Korean President Kim Dae-jung. The meeting with the North Korean leader, announced in early August, was initially scheduled for the end of that month but was postponed after massive flooding in Pyongyang. The Koreas summit comes in the final months of Roh's scandal-ridden term, and some analysts suspect the South Korean leader is hoping the Pyongyang meeting will boost his sagging approval ratings and help position his party in the upcoming elections against the conservative opposition. A joint statement following the 2000 summit between Kim Jong Il and Kim Dae-jung indicated the next meeting between the Korean leaders would take place in Seoul. Roh's decision not to push for a meeting outside the North Korean capital was criticized by Bruce Klinger of the Heritage Foundation's Asian Studies Center in a recent article titled, ""Seoul's Impetuous Summit Initiative."" ""It is indicative of Roh's eagerness that he failed to insist on holding the summit in the Kaesong special economic zone in North Korea to highlight the flagship initiative of Seoul's engagement policy,"" Klinger wrote. But one South Korean woman said she believes the summit ""is our last chance"" to negotiate the freedom of hundreds of Korean prisoners of war and abductees, including her father, a fisherman on a boat believed abducted by the North more than 30 years ago. Other South Koreans have protested the summit -- including one man who set himself on fire during a demonstration in Seoul -- demanding that Roh push North Korea on its human rights violations during the talks. Instead, the summit is expected to address military tensions, including settling a sea border dispute on the west coast of the Korean peninsula, and economic issues, such as how South Korean businesses can help the North climb out of extreme poverty. The 2000 summit, part of Kim Dae-jung's policy of engagement with North Korea, paved the way for his Nobel Peace Prize awarded that same year. But South Korean investigators later revealed that Kim Dae-jung paid hundreds of millions of dollars to secure the meeting, the first between Stalinist North Korea and capitalist South Korea.

"(CNN) -- Three Al Jazeera English journalists were convicted in Egypt on Monday of aiding the Muslim Brotherhood in a ruling that immediately outraged journalists and activists around the world. Peter Greste, Mohamed Fahmy and Baher Mohamed had been imprisoned in Cairo since December on charges that included conspiring with the Brotherhood, spreading false news and endangering national security. The three men have steadfastly denied the charges, as has Al Jazeera, and the prosecution put forth no evidence to support the allegations. Prosecutors were criticized for presenting evidence that was purportedly made up or irrelevant to the case, like videos of Greste's old news reports from other countries. A judge sentenced Greste, a native of Australia and a former BBC correspondent, and Fahmy, a journalist formerly employed by CNN, to seven years behind bars. Mohamed was sentenced to a decade -- seven years for one charge and three years for a second. Fahmy has dual nationality, with Egyptian-Canadian citizenship. On Monday, Canadian Minister of State Lynne Yelich said in a statement that Canada is ""very disappointed with the verdict."" After the verdict, Fahmy's mother, Wafaa Basiouny, wept inside the courtroom. ""Why seven years?"" she said. ""What did he do? Who did he kill?"" Three other international journalists -- Sue Turton and Dominic Kane of Al Jazeera and Rena Netjes, a correspondent for Dutch newspaper Parool -- were sentenced in absentia to 10 years, reports said, adding that the journalists are expected to appeal, according to the nonprofit Committee to Protect Journalists, which advocates for media freedom worldwide. Watch an earlier interview with Turton on CNN . Sherif Mansour, CPJ's Middle East and North Africa program coordinator, called the convictions ""shocking"" and ""an extremely disturbing sign for the future of the Egyptian press."" Amid that international condemnation, the Egyptian foreign ministry defended itself on Monday, saying it ""strongly rejects any comment from a foreign party that casts doubt on the independence of the Egyptian judiciary and the justice of its verdicts."" 'Silencing the truth' CNN has firmly supported the journalists throughout the trial. Because Al Jazeera has no staff operating in Egypt, CNN and other international broadcasters have been contributing reporting to its television coverage. ""All at CNN are dismayed at today's unjust sentencing of the Al Jazeera journalists in Egypt,"" the network said in a statement. ""Freedom of the media must be protected, and journalists must be free to carry out their legitimate work without fear of imprisonment. We stand alongside the journalistic community in calling for the immediate release of these journalists."" Throughout the trial, a who's who of internationally known journalists, including CNN's Christiane Amanpour, repeatedly called for the release of Greste, Fahmy and Mohamed. Amanpour held up a sign on her CNN International show that said ""#freeAJStaff"" and joined a campaign meant to call attention to their plight. See Amanpour, on her CNN show, confront powerful Egyptian about journalists' jailing . Amanpour spoke on CNN's ""Reliable Sources"" in February about the chilling effect of imprisoning journalists. ""If you try to be objective in your coverage, you are deemed a terrorist,"" she said. ""I mean, it is terrible what's happening there. It is silencing the truth."" In an interview on Al Jazeera shortly after the verdicts were read, Amnesty International Director Steve Crawshaw deplored what he called an ""outrageous ruling"" and called the convictions an ""absolute affront to justice."" In a televised interview, Mostefa Souag, the acting director general of Al Jazeera, called the verdict ""shocking."" ""I don't think it has anything to do with justice,"" he said, calling it another step in Egypt's ""campaign of terrorizing people and terrorizing the media."" Al Jazeera English Managing Director Al Anstey said in a statement that the sentencing ""defies logic, sense, and any semblance of justice."" ""There is only one sensible outcome now,"" Anstey added. ""For the verdict to be overturned, and justice to be recognized by Egypt. We must keep our voice loud to call for an end to their detention."" CNN correspondent Ian Lee, stationed outside the court in Cairo, said that through an appeals process, ""there's a high likelihood that a judge could either reduce the sentence or acquit them later on."" Pawns in a geopolitical dispute? The Egyptian Embassy in London released a statement Monday, saying that the sentences were the result of ""a judicial process during which the court has examined this case over several sessions in the last six months"" and that the defense and prosecution were given ""full opportunity"" to present their cases. The embassy said it doesn't comment on the content of court rulings, but it added that ""freedom of expression and thought are basic and unalienable rights"" that are protected in Egypt's new constitution. Read more about Egypt's new constitution . The prosecution, which has argued that channels like Al Jazeera brought down Iraq and were planning to do the same in Egypt, has been widely condemned by international correspondents, media organizations and foreign governments. ""We're obviously shocked, dismayed, really bewildered by the decision of the court in Egypt,"" said Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott. ""We understand the need of the Egyptian government to maintain internal order and to crackdown on extremism including the Muslim Brotherhood, but it is important that there be due process, it is important that decisions be made on a fair and just basis,"" he added. Amnesty International has said that Greste, Fahmy and Mohamed are pawns in a geopolitical dispute between Egypt and Qatar, the tiny Middle Eastern country that finances Al Jazeera. Qatar has long been perceived as a supporter of the Muslim Brotherhood, a religious and political group banned in Egypt and labeled a terrorist organization after President Mohamed Morsy's ouster last year. That declaration came just days before the Al Jazeera journalists were arrested at the Cairo hotel where they were working. Egyptian state-run media said they were charged with ""broadcasting false information"" to harm the country's national security and being members of an illegal organization, the Muslim Brotherhood. A number of other defendants, with no affiliation to Al Jazeera, were also convicted Monday of similar charges. Canadian Minister of State Yelich said in the statement that Canada is ""concerned that the judicial process that led to his (Fahmy's) verdict is inconsistent with Egypt's democratic aspirations. A fair and transparent legal system is a critical pillar of a future stable and democratic Egypt."" Canada wants the Egyptian government to ""protect the rights of all individuals, including journalists,"" the statement said. 'Just doing their job' The three Al Jazeera employees are ""first-class journalists,"" Anstey said in a statement after the journalists had been detained for three months. ""They were just doing their job covering and challenging all sides of the story in Egypt."" In an interview for CNN's ""Reliable Sources,"" Greste's parents, Juris and Lois, said they could not understand why Peter was still behind bars. ""Peter had no reason, no motive for doing anything like the allegations against him,"" Lois Greste said. ""He would have reported the same story, be it for CNN, BBC, Reuters or anybody else."" Juris Greste said it was not unreasonable to characterize his son as a ""political prisoner."" ""It looks like a kidnapping by the state, as it were,"" he said, even as he emphasized that he and his wife ""bear no ill will against Egypt or its people."" After the verdict against their son, Greste's parents spoke to reporters in Australia. ""We are not usually a family of superlatives, but I have to say this morning my vocabulary fails to convey just how shattered we are,"" said Juris Greste said. ""You can never prepare yourself for something as painful as this."" He held up a picture of his son and said: ""This man ... is an award-winning journalist. He's not a criminal."" On Sunday, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said he spoke ""specifically about Al Jazeera journalists"" during a meeting with the new Egyptian President, Abdel Fattah el-Sisi. While Kerry did not elaborate on the outcome, he said generally that they ""discussed the essential role of a vibrant civil society, a free press, and rule of law, and due process in a democracy."" On Monday, Kerry said the ""chilling, draconian sentences"" were ""a deeply disturbing setback to Egypt's transition."" He said el-Sisi should ""consider all available remedies, including pardons,"" for the journalists and ""all of the political sentences and verdicts pronounced during the last few years."" Reading a statement at a media briefing Monday, White House spokesman Josh Earnest said the Obama administration ""strongly condemns"" the journalists' sentencing. The verdict, Earnest said, ""flouts the most basic standards of media freedom,"" and he added that the White House is calling on the Egyptian government to pardon the journalists. Journalists in jail . There are 167 journalists imprisoned around the world, including the three Al Jazeera journalists sentenced Monday, according to Reporters Without Borders. China has the largest number of journalists behind bars, with 32, followed by Eritrea (28) and Syria (16), the media freedom organization says. Twenty-eight journalists have been killed doing their jobs this year, the group says. Reporters without Borders ranks Egypt 159 out of 180 countries for media freedom. According to the Committee to Project Journalists, at least 14 journalists are imprisoned in Egypt and more than 65 journalists have been detained since Morsy was ousted in July. Most, the group said, have been freed.

"(CNN) -- The shooting down of a Malaysian airliner over Ukraine may finally force Washington and Europe to wake up to the danger of the conflict there escalating into full-blown war between Russia and Ukraine. This potential cataclysm has been inching closer to reality in the last week. The Ukrainian security council has said Russian weapons and troops have been crossing into Ukraine, and military aircraft from both sides have engaged each other. Documented videos purport to show artillery fire into Ukraine from the Russian side. On Sunday the Russian media went berserk with reports of the first casualty of a Russian civilian on the Russian side, from an artillery shot of disputed origin. Former Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov told me Monday he was decidedly more pessimistic about the prospects for resolving this crisis than he was three months ago. As a veteran of international negotiations in 1999 on Kosovo and in 2003 on Iraq, he was perplexed as to why the international community was not trying harder to resolve the Ukraine crisis. Last weekend the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council, plus Germany, met with Iran on its nuclear issue but failed to use that opportunity to discuss Ukraine seriously. The Ukraine conflict urgently requires the most resolute and determined efforts to de-escalate before we reach a point no return. Washington should be focusing policy attention on strengthening Ukraine's capacity to defend its sovereignty, economically and physically; instead it has a misplaced obsession with using economic sanctions to punish Russia. The Obama administration and its critics on the right, such as Republican Sen. Bob Corker, contend that such sanctions will change Russian behavior, but there is not a shred of evidence to suggest this strategy would be effective. There are many reasons why a policy over-weighted on punishing Russia is a dubious strategy at best. First, the Russian economy was in stagnation, if not recession, with capital flying out of the country at record rates before the annexation of Crimea in March. The Obama administration cannot credibly claim its policies have made a significant difference to the Russian economy. They only allow Vladimir Putin to blame the West for Russia's poor economy and deflect attention from the real culprit, his failed economic policy since returning to the presidency two years ago. Second, Russia's political economy and psychology are far more suited to absorbing punishment than the West. Russian companies suffering from sanctions can likely expect government subsidies to compensate their losses. I doubt U.S. and European companies can expect the same. They will simply lose market share. What's more, a thousand years of history suggests the Russians are by far the most effective in punishing themselves. Finally, if Russians perceive their punishment is inflicted by others, it is a powerful stimulant to national consolidation and a spur to inflict unimaginable punishment on others. Putin is an archetypal traditional Russian leader who aspires to making a historical imprint like Stalin and Ivan the Terrible. This is a bloody serious game he is playing, cynical and determined beyond what flabby American and European strategic thinking can or wants to comprehend. He will not be deterred by sanctions. He has made a mockery of the G7 ultimatum in June that he cease and desist in Ukraine in 30 days or else. He has responded by sending more men and equipment across the border, with the predictable result that the ""separatists"" (the so-called Donetsk People's Republic is led by well-known Russian citizens) actions have escalated. The only good news is that the Ukrainian government's military force has been extremely successful in destroying pro-Russian rebel strongholds over the past month. And herein lies the urgency of the problem. The rebel cause has been close to failing, with the defense of Luhansk and Donetsk being the endgame. Putin cannot allow that to happen as it could shatter his leadership position -- he will not allow it to happen, plain and simple. The Ukrainian government has every right to defend its sovereignty against this Russian-instigated insurgency. There is no other solution but urgent diplomacy to de-escalate and to get international peacekeepers to the border region as quickly as possible. The stakes in allowing this war to go on are far too high to allow for anything else.","Andrew Kuchins: Jet's downing must awaken U.S., Europe to danger of Russia-Ukraine war .

"Fukushima, Japan (CNN) -- Mikio Watanabe's Fukushima home is contaminated with radiation and filled with the nightmares of his wife's horrific suicide. ""I can still see it,"" says the 62-year old, the tears welling in his eyes. What he sees is Hamako, his wife of 39 years, on fire and scorched. The 58-year-old doused herself in kerosene and set herself on fire last July after slipping into an overwhelming depression. As evacuees from last year's Fukushima nuclear disaster, Mikio and Hamako lost everything: their home, their jobs, and any hope for the future. ""If there was no nuclear accident, we wouldn't have gone through this terrible thing,"" he says. ""This is TEPCO's fault."" TEPCO, or the Tokyo Electric Power Company, owns the Fukushima nuclear plant. The triple nuclear meltdown at the plant spewed radiation across a wide swath of Fukushima prefecture, forcing the mandatory evacuation of 70,000 residents and a second tier evacuation of an additional 90,000. The Watanabes were part of the second tier evacuation in Kawamata in Fukushima prefecture, where radiation readings top nationally acceptable levels. In a landmark case, Watanabe filed a lawsuit last month against TEPCO, blaming the utility company for his wife's suicide. The aim of his lawsuit, he says, is to push TEPCO and the Japanese government to stop treating the nuclear accident as if it's a natural disaster. Watanabe wants TEPCO to compensate and treat victims for a man-made accident, which would expedite how the company cares for evacuees. Evacuees like Watanabe say TEPCO is moving too slowly to restore the lives of impacted residents. That lack of speed, he says, is leading to social fallout like suicide. TEPCO, in a statement to CNN, said it would not comment on lawsuits filed against the company. Watanabe says his wife's depression happened gradually, after they evacuated out of their home into a cramped temporary housing unit. When the chicken factory where they worked shut down because it was in the evacuation zone, the couple lost their jobs. Watanabe says his wife began to worry incessantly about how to pay off their mortgage, made worse because they had nothing to fill their days as evacuees. ""She cried so much and repeatedly asked me to take her to our home,"" he says. He decided to plan an overnight trip to their house in Kawamata on June 30. That night, the Watanabes enjoyed life as they expected to live it -- eating in their dining room and looking out at the garden. ""We talked a lot then,"" recalls Watanabe. ""I don't quite remember what we talked about, but we shared a lot."" Watanabe went to bed with his wife, feeling happier and more comfortable than he had in many weeks. ""At 1 a.m., I woke up to use the restroom and when I went back to bed, she grabbed my arm and wouldn't let go. She was crying so hard then."" Watanabe pauses. That was the last time he would ever hear his wife's voice. ""The next morning, I woke up early around 4 a.m. I snuck out quietly to start clearing the brush around the house again. When I got to the corner of the house, I saw a fire go up at about human height. I didn't think too much of it at the time."" Watanabe continued to weed around his house and went inside to take a shower. When he couldn't find his wife after about an hour, he grew concerned. He started to wander around his yard and remembered the fire. ""I went there to take a look. Then I found her, burned."" Watanabe says it's strange what you remember in trauma. He recalls being shocked and standing frozen but he also remembers trying to put out the fire with his hands. But he will never forget the image of his wife's charred and stiff body, her legs and midriff still burning, and the flies beginning to gather around her open mouth. This wasn't supposed to happen, says Watanabe. He and his wife met in elementary school but fell in love in their early 20s. They raised three children and a grandchild in their home. They took out a second mortgage on their home so they could renovate it for the next generation of their family. ""We lost everything,"" he says. ""We were forced to evacuate. We lost our jobs. I lost my wife in such a terrible way. I really lost everything."" Watanabe's lawsuit seeks to elevate his wife's suicide beyond the horror tale whispered among evacuees. ""Watanabe's case is very symbolic,"" says his attorney Tsugio Hirota. ""All of Fukushima feels the same way. Their despair and their anger that they have no foreseeable future stands behind this case."" TEPCO has begun decontaminating affected communities. Across Fukushima prefecture, crews are scraping away contaminated soil, acre by acre. But it is painfully slow as the contaminated area is approximately 10 times the size of New York's Manhattan Island. Due to the size of the affected area, TEPCO and the Japanese government are unable to estimate if and when residents will ever be able to return. ""I feel an unspeakable rage,"" says Watanabe. ""If I don't do something, my wife is just another suicide case.""","Last year's nuclear meltdown spewed radiation across a wide swath of Fukushima prefecture .

"(CNN) -- U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice withdrew her name from consideration Thursday for secretary of state. Over the past few months, a slew of articles have criticized Rice's personality. The Daily Beast recently ran a piece titled ""Susan Rice's Personality Disorder."" These articles allege that America's U.N. ambassador is ""brusque,"" ""dismissive,"" ""undiplomatic,"" ""shrill"" and awful to work for. I felt compelled to write something because these caricatures of Rice bear no resemblance to my former boss. I worked for Susan Rice in 2009 and 2010 as her special assistant in the Washington office of the U.S. Mission to the United Nations. Over the past few weeks, I have talked to other junior staffers for Riceâcurrent and formerâwho all share my surprise at the way she has been described. Junior staffers see a side of their ""principal""âWashington-speak for bossâthat others do not. Being a special assistant involves a wide swath of activities: couriering papers, sitting in on meetings and delving into some policy issues. In this multifaceted role, my colleagues and I saw Rice as a boss, as a diplomat and as a person. In each arena, Rice demonstrated a rare combination of openness, honesty and passion. Read more: Susan Rice withdraws from consideration as secretary of state . Early on in the job, I delivered a 50-page paper on Afghanistan to Rice. Before I could set it down on her desk, she asked, ""What do you think of it?"" I hadn't read a word and froze. I soon found out that this was typical of Rice. She always asks people at all levels what they think; she's not concerned with hierarchy or status, just ideas. You see this in her strategy meetings, which always involve staff at all levels. You also see this when Rice tours foreign countries. She is just as interested in the stories of people on the streets as the proclamations of ministersâand often more so. Democrat 'extremely upset' with Rice's withdrawal . As a diplomat, Rice can be extraordinarily charming. She can put new acquaintances instantly at ease. But she can just as easily snap them to attention. Rice has little patience for dissembling and her insistence on thorough preparation means that she invariably knows the subject matter as well asâand usually better thanâher interlocutor. This enables Rice to move from charm to hard substance in an instant, getting to the heart of an issue quickly. Some people have criticized this aspect of Rice's personality as ""undiplomatic."" If diplomacy is the art of talking and doing nothing, then perhaps they're right. But that has never been Susan Rice. Rice is in government because she believes in strengthening America and improving this world. Rice believes that advancing core principles serves U.S. interests in the long run. You can see this belief guiding her approach to issue after issue, in meeting after meeting. Read more: Rice's letter to the President . Rice is down to earth, too, which won the loyalty of her slightly younger staffers in particular. She has an inexplicably vast collection of go-go musicâa D.C. invention. She has mastered social media and new technology, but only after overcoming a healthy dose of skepticism. And she has a general demeanor, some combination of athlete and wonk, that conveys cool. I don't mean to minimize the serious policy issues she has handled as U.N. ambassador, a member of President Obama's Cabinet and a lifelong public servant. One op-ed is not enough space to engage her many accomplishments in government and the various policy disputes that inevitably arise over 20 years in high office. Opinion: A lucky day for Susan Rice . All I can say in this short pieceâand say with total confidenceâis that Susan Rice is a wonderful person and an inspiring boss. Washington is filled with people seeking power for its own sake; people embroiled in partisan politics; petty people; imperious, dismissive people; people who put themselves before others. But that is not Susan Rice. The views expressed in this commentary are solely those of Amar C. Bakshi.","Susan Rice withdraws her name from consideration for State .

"(CNN) -- When Wisconsin temple gunman Wade Michael Page arrived at Fort Bragg in 1995, the sprawling Army base in North Carolina already was home to a small number of white supremacists including three soldiers later convicted in the murder of an African-American couple. The killings launched a military investigation that tightened regulations against extremist activity, but some say such influences persist in today's armed forces. ""Outside every major military installation, you will have at least two or three active neo-Nazi organizations actively trying to recruit on-duty personnel,"" said T.J. Leyden, a former white power skinhead in the U.S. Marines who now conducts anti-extremism training. 'Swimming upstream,' white supremacist groups still strong . Page died in a shootout with police responding to his attack Sunday on a Sikh temple in the Milwaukee suburb of Oak Creek that killed six people and wounded four, including a police officer. He had ties to white supremacist groups and the FBI acknowledges it knew of him, though no formal investigation ever took place. According to Pete Simi, a University of Nebraska criminologist who knew Page, the military experience at Fort Bragg helped instill Page's allegiance to the white power movement. ""What he told me during the course of our time together was that he really started to identify with the neo-Nazism during his time in the military,"" said Simi, who met Page in 2001 while doing a study on white power groups in California. ""And specifically, what he told me at one point was that, if you join the military and you're not a racist, then you certainly will be by the time you leave."" In particular, Simi told CNN, Page's military experience bolstered his perception that ""the deck was stacked against whites."" ""He came to feel that there was preferential treatment for African-Americans in the military and whites were always on the short end of the stick,"" Simi continued. ""And the more he got into the Nazi ideology, the more he came to see all of society in that way."" While Page knew about neo-Nazis and racist skinheads before joining the Army, ""he really started getting into it during his time in the military,"" said Simi, author of ""American Swastika: Inside the White Power Movement's Hidden Spaces of Hate."" Opinion: Hate with a beat -- White power music . Page joined the Army in 1992 and ended up at Fort Bragg in 1995, around the time that the base became the focus of white extremism in the military when three members of the 82nd Airborne Division stationed there were arrested in connection with the murder of an African-American couple in nearby Fayetteville. Investigators found neo-Nazi materials in the barracks of the men, and all three were eventually convicted. The case prompted a military review that determined 22 soldiers at the base had past or present links to skinhead groups, though investigators concluded there was no organized extremist movement operating among the more than 14,000 troops of the 82nd Airborne at the time. Those who served with Page say he showed racist tendencies then. ""He was involved with white supremacy. He talked about the racial holy war a lot,"" said Chris Robillard, who met Page at Fort Bragg in 1995 when both were doing psychological operations training. While describing Page as a close friend and a kind person, Robillard also said that ""when he'd rant, it would be about mostly any non-white person."" ""I know everyone is going to paint him as a racist with hatred, but that's not how I remember him,"" Robillard said. ""The racial holy war talk I always took as something he would vent about, and not act on it. I never pictured him as someone who would do anything. I thought maybe he was just saying it for attention."" To J.M. Berger, a counterterrorism analyst and editor for IntelWire.Com, the military attracts extremists because of the weapons training it provides. ""One thing that we really have to keep in mind is that extremists are often explicitly interested in joining the military because they get training that they can use later,"" Berger told CNN, adding that ""there have been some explicit discussions among leaders of some of these groups that their followers should join the Army to get trained."" In talking to military veterans, Berger said, he hears ""different things from different people."" ""Some say that there's not a massive problem. Others have expressed concern to me about what they've seen in the ranks,"" he continued. ""And, you know, the military is a massive operation like the U.S. population. There are going to be some people who are problems."" Temple killings put spotlight on 'hate rock' Page received a general discharge under honorable conditions from the Army in 1998 due to ""discreditable incidents,"" according to a Pentagon official who spoke on condition of not being identified. Robillard said Page showed up drunk for duty one morning, which led to his eventual discharge. The two men parted ways until 2000, when Page visited Robillard at his home in Arkansas. ""He had gone through a dramatic change,"" Robillard said of the meeting, the last time he saw Page in person. ""His talk about the racist war was ... more like he really did believe it."" Leyden, the former white supremacist who wrote the book ""Skinhead Confessions: From Hate to Hope,"" said he openly displayed his extremist leanings while serving in the Marine Corps in the late 1980s. ""I used to hang a swastika flag on my wall locker and everybody in my unit all the way up to my commander knew it,"" he said. ""The only time they ever asked me to take it down was when the commanding general would come through, just so they wouldn't get in trouble. And afterwards, I would put it right back up and they were perfectly fine with it."" He noted that his brother's unit had less tolerance for such displays. ""His commanding officer went to the barracks and anything that was racist or seemed to be racist, he made them send it home,"" Leyden said. ""So it really depends on the commanding officers and who's in charge of that base."" After the 1995 murder case involving the three Fort Bragg soldiers, the Army appointed a task force to investigate the extent of white supremacists in its ranks and also started including training against extremism. White supremacist group member pleads guilty . According to the Department of Defense website, the task force visited 28 installations and interviewed more than 7,500 soldiers. It found that less than 1% said they had seen soldiers or civilian employees involved with extremist groups. A decade later, the Southern Law Poverty Center reported in 2006 that some high-profile members of extremist groups were serving in the U.S. military. According to the organization, which tracks hate groups in the United States, the presence of extremists in the military increased with the need to bolster ranks for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.

"Sanford, Florida (CNN) -- George Zimmerman told his lawyers that he whispered ""punks,"" not a racial slur, in the moments before he shot Trayvon Martin, his attorneys told CNN on Thursday. Some people interpreted the police recording of Zimmerman's call to 911 as evidence the fatal shooting was racially motivated. Zimmerman attorneys Hal Ulrig and Craig Sonner told CNN their client told them that he said, ""F---ing punks."" Forensic audio expert Tom Owen, who analyzed 911 recordings, agreed the garbled word that raised controversy was ""punks,"" not the racial slur some people said they heard . When Owen, chairman emeritus of the American Board of Recorded Evidence, used a computer application to remove cell phone interference, the word became clearer, he said. After discussions with linguists, he said he became convinced that Zimmerman said ""punks."" He provided CNN with a copy of the newly processed audio. CNN also enhanced the sound of the 911 call, and several members of CNN's editorial staff repeatedly reviewed the tape but could reach no consensus on whether Zimmerman used a slur. Martin's family and supporters say Zimmerman, who is Hispanic, profiled Martin, who was black, as ""suspicious"" and ignored a police dispatcher's request not to follow him. Martin did not live in Sanford, Florida, but he was there with his father, whose fiancee lives in Zimmerman's neighborhood. Zimmerman, 28, fatally shot Martin, 17, on February 26. The case has triggered a nationwide debate about Florida's ""Stand Your Ground"" law, race and racial profiling. While Zimmerman's attorneys may welcome Owen's analysis of their client's 911 call, they disagree with his conclusions about what is heard on another 911 recording. Zimmerman has said he was yelling for help, according to his family members and his account to authorities, as first reported by The Orlando Sentinel and later confirmed by Sanford police. But Martin's relatives, including his cousin Ronquavis Fulton, have said they are certain the voice heard on the 911 call is Martin's. Owen and another audio expert, Ed Primeau, analyzed the recording for the Sentinel using different techniques, and they said they don't believe it is Zimmerman who is heard yelling in the background of one 911 call. They compared the screams with Zimmerman's voice, as recorded in a 911 call he made minutes earlier describing a ""suspicious"" black male. ""There's a huge chance that this is not Zimmerman's voice,"" said Primeau, a longtime audio engineer who is listed as an expert in recorded evidence by the American College of Forensic Examiners International. ""After 28 years of doing this, I would put my reputation on the line and say this is not George Zimmerman screaming."" Owen also said he does not believe the screams came from Zimmerman. He does not have a sample of Martin's voice for comparison, he said. He cited software that is widely used in Europe and has become recently accepted in the United States that examines characteristics such as pitch and the space between spoken words to analyze voices. Using it, he found a 48% likelihood the voice is Zimmerman's. At least 60% is necessary to feel confident that two samples are from the same source, he told CNN on Monday -- meaning it's unlikely it was Zimmerman who can be heard yelling. The experts, both of whom said they have testified in cases involving audio analysis, stressed that they cannot say who was screaming. CNN's Martin Savidge and Tristan Smith contributed to this report.","Zimmerman said, ""f---ing punks"" in 911 call, his attorneys say .

"Washington (CNN) -- Stevie Wonder is boycotting, demonstrators are demanding and President Barack Obama and a veteran GOP senator also are calling for changes in ""stand your ground"" self-defense laws in the aftermath of the Trayvon Martin killing. Despite such pressure tactics, neither Obama nor Congress have much say in the matter because the battleground for altering or eliminating the statutes is in state legislatures rather than Washington. Florida, where Martin was shot to death last year by neighborhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman, is one of more than 20 states with a ""stand your ground"" law or some other form self-defense measure. Last week, Gov. Rick Scott met with protesters seeking repeal of the law and told them it won't happen, citing the recommendation of a task force he appointed after Martin's killing. Weekend ""Justice for Trayvon"" vigils continued the push by civil rights leaders for repealing such laws, and Wonder has said he refused to perform in Florida or any other state that has them. To former Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Steele, Wonder's boycott showed the difficulty facing those seeking repeal. ""This is something that's going to have to get worked out state-by-state,"" Steele told NBC's ""Meet the Press"" on Sunday. ""It's not just Florida."" The sliding scales of self-defense . On the same program, Democratic Rep. Marcia Fudge of Ohio said leadership at the federal level can help, but the Congressional Black Caucus chairman added that ""you cannot legislate against prejudice or bias or racism."" The Zimmerman trial that concluded July 13 with an acquittal in a Florida court has sparked a fierce national debate involving race, justice and politics. Martin, a 17-year-old unarmed African-American, was shot to death by Zimmerman in a confrontation in a residential community. Civil rights groups say Zimmerman started the fight in what they label racial profiling, while his lawyers argued the shooting was in self defense after Martin attacked him. Two new polls released Monday showed a divided American public over the verdict, with equal numbers saying they approved or disapproved. A Washington Post/ABC News survey found 41% of respondents in favor and 41% against the jury's ruling, with a sharp difference between African-Americans and whites. The poll showed that 86% of African-Americans opposed the verdict, while 51% of whites agreed with it. That was similar to a Pew Research Center survey that showed that 86% of African-Americans disagreed with the verdict, while 49% of whites were in favor. Obama issued a written statement after the verdict, then stayed silent until Friday, when he sought to explain the anger among African-Americans over Zimmerman's acquittal while also indicating no federal charges would be filed against him. ""Once the jury's spoken, that's how our system works,"" he said, adding that while Attorney General Eric Holder was looking further at the case, those calling for federal civil rights charges must ""have some clear expectations here."" In America, law enforcement and the criminal code are ""traditionally done at the state and local levels, not at the federal level,"" Obama said. That also applies to ""stand your ground"" laws, which exist in nine states. In addition, 22 states including Florida have laws stating that residents have no ""duty"" to retreat from a would-be attacker, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Stevie Wonder says he'll boycott 'stand your ground' states . The Florida version of the law states that ""a person who is not engaged in an unlawful activity and who is attacked in any other place where he or she has a right to be has no duty to retreat and has the right to stand his or her ground and meet force with force, including deadly force if he or she reasonably believes it is necessary to do so to prevent death or great bodily harm to himself or herself or another or to prevent the commission of a forcible felony."" Though Zimmerman's defense never cited ""stand your ground"" laws in its case, the jury was instructed to consider them during deliberations. Zimmerman was acquitted of all charges. The ""stand your ground"" laws came about with support from the National Rifle Association, which argues that self-defense is a fundamental human right. In his remarks Friday, Obama called for reconsideration of those measures. ""I think it would be useful for us to examine some state and local laws to see if they are designed in such a way that they may encourage the kinds of altercations and confrontations and tragedies that we saw in the Florida case, rather than diffuse potential altercations,"" Obama said. Conservative GOP Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas immediately slammed Obama's comment, warning it could bring an assault on the right of Americans to own guns. ""It is not surprising that the president uses, it seems, every opportunity that he can to go after our Second Amendment right to bear arms,"" Cruz said. However, fellow Republican Sen. John McCain of Arizona rejected Cruz's conclusion and said he believes the Arizona legislature would take another look at what he called the state's ""controversial"" law. Protestors stand up to 'stand your ground,' but laws likely to stay . What are the chances of repeal? In Florida, Scott's office noted that the task force he appointed recommends the law stay in place, though with minor tweaks, including limiting neighborhood watches to observing and reporting. Daniel Webster, director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research, said he doubted protests against ""stand your ground"" laws would change anything. Overturning laws isn't very common, he said, and ""stand your ground"" laws have some popular appeal due to the ""the very general notion that citizens should be able to protect themselves and you shouldn't have to, in essence, run from crime."" Also, Webster noted, the laws are relatively new, with most enacted in the past eight years. Therefore, it was unlikely the same legislators who passed them would suddenly be inclined to think they were wrong, he said. ""The more common response is, they're going to dig their heels,"" Webster added. Doubts about 'stand your ground' According to the National District Attorneys Association, ""stand your ground"" laws emerged due to ""diminished sense of public safety"" after 9/11, a lack of confidence in the criminal justice system's ability to protect victims, a perception that due process trumps victims' rights and a decrease in gun legislation. A study by the group cited concerns from law enforcement officials about such laws, including doubts that they would deter criminals. Webster pointed to a Texas A&M University study examining crime in more than 20 states that passed some version of ""stand your ground"" laws from 2000 to 2010. Researchers found that not only was there no decrease in robbery, burglary and aggravated assault, but there was an 8% spike in reported murders and non-negligent manslaughter. CNN's Eliott C. McLaughlin and Kevin Liptak contributed to this report.","NEW: Polls show America is divided over the Zimmerman verdict .

"(CNN) -- Last week, John Schnatter, the founder and CEO of Papa John's Pizza, announced that the Affordable Care Act will raise the cost of his pizza 11 to 14 cents each, or 15 to 20 cents per order. This has caused some to gloat that Obamacare won't be ""free"" after all but will be passed down to consumers in the form of higher prices. Well, duh. For the sake of this discussion, I'm going to ignore the fact that Schnatter is a supporter and fundraiser for Mitt Romney, and take him at his word. I'm also going to assume that his numbers are not inflated at all but represent an accurate representation of what will happen in 2014. Still -- this isn't news. Opinion: Why Mitt Romney is losing . Let's start with the idea, espoused by many who oppose the law, that there is some expectation from those that support the law that health care is ""free."" It's not, and no one I know defends it as such. It costs a lot of money to enact the law: The most recent estimate is well over a trillion dollars over the next decade. It is referred to as deficit-reducing, however, because it lowers spending in other areas or collects new revenue, such that its costs are more than paid for. But no one should think that it doesn't cost money. Moreover, no one should think that individuals won't pay for the law. Of course they will. Everything the government does is paid for by individual Americans, including the Affordable Care Act. That's what taxes are for. What the health care ruling means to you . Some may try to argue that more than half of Americans don't pay any taxes, but they are referring only to federal income tax. Those people still pay payroll taxes, sales taxes, state income taxes, excise taxes and more. When you add all of those up, it turns out that nearly everyone pays taxes. We're all paying for the Affordable Care Act, just as we all pay for defense spending, we all pay for Medicaid, and we all pay for Social Security. No one thinks government spending is free. Uninsured Americans who get private insurance in the exchanges are going to pay even more. Even those receiving the largest subsidies will still have to pay for some of their premiums, along with additional out-of-pocket costs. As people earn more, their share of health care spending goes up, too. They all pay. Even Americans who get their insurance from their employers pay for their care. No one should be under the illusion that their ""bosses"" are generously picking up the tab. There are many studies that show that premiums and wages offset one another. Employees (read: individuals) pay for their health insurance themselves through lower wages. So let's stop attacking the Affordable Care Act because it will mean that we -- meaning individual Americans -- are paying for health care. We always do. Let's circle back around to Papa John's, though. Part of what the act does is mandate that companies start providing health insurance to their employees or pay a penalty. Since some don't do that already, this will cost them money. They could take this out of profits or reduce the salaries of their executives, but they will probably do what every business does: They'll pass it on to the consumer. This is as it should be. Some companies probably keep costs down by not providing comprehensive health benefits to their employees. Now, they will have to. I imagine some companies already do, which probably increases their costs, and now they will be on a more level playing field. Regardless, Papa John's is telling you that people who order its pizza will now bear the cost of its employees' health insurance. Again -- as it should be! Should people who don't order Papa John's pizza have to pay for that insurance? That's what's happening now. In 2004, for instance, more than half of Wal-Mart employees (PDF) did not get health care coverage through their jobs. More than a quarter of children of Wal-Mart employees therefore got their insurance through Medicaid or SCHIP. That means Wal-Mart didn't pay for their health insurance; taxpayers did. Moreover, every time an uninsured employee had to go to an emergency department and receive uncompensated care, who paid for that? The rest of us. Where in the world can you get universal health care? Things got so bad that Maryland passed a law in 2006 that pretty much targeted Wal-Mart to demand that it spend 8% of payroll on health benefits or pay the difference to Medicaid. Yes, Wal-Mart might have had to raise its prices a bit to cover that. But doesn't it make more sense for those who choose to shop at Wal-Mart to foot the bill, than for everyone, including those who don't, to have to pay for its employees' health care? You may believe that we, as a country, shouldn't pay for care for the uninsured. But most of us are unwilling to let the sick, especially children, suffer. So we -- individual Americans -- have been paying for this health care, saving those companies money, regardless of whether we availed ourselves of their services. No longer. Under the Affordable Care Act, those costs will be the responsibility of those businesses and eventually their customers. One last point. My kids happen to love Papa John's. Some Saturdays, when my wife and I go out, they will order pizza from there. The usual delivery runs about $20. According to Schnatter, the cost of health insurance to his employees might raise the price about 1%. If it had gone up twice that because of a pepperoni shortage, I doubt it would have made the news at all. More than 30 million Americans will get insurance under the Affordable Care Act. Tens of millions more will be protected from underinsurance, annual and lifetime limits, and unfair price increases. If the downside of this is that my pizza costs 20 cents more, that seems a pretty small price to pay. The opinions in this commentary are solely those of Aaron E. Carroll.","Papa John's Pizza's CEO said the Affordable Care Act will raise the cost of his pizza .

"(CNN) -- If you grew up in the 1980s there's nothing guaranteed to make you feel older than a trip to the movies. ""Conan the Barbarian"", ""The Thing"" and ""Footloose""... What's next? ""Top Gun""? But if there have to be remakes, then let them all be as much fun as Craig Brewer's ""Footloose."" Brewer's previous movies, ""Hustle & Flow"" and ""Black Snake Moan,"" were southern exploitation pictures with a smooth retro gloss, their sleazy trappings disguising a heart of pure vanilla. But both showed a real feel for music: hip-hop and 12-bar blues respectively. That's a good starting point when it comes to ""Footloose,"" a fairly trite rock-n-roll rebellion story that's redeemed by its faith in dance. The 1984 original was the first screenplay by songwriter Dean Pitchford, and Brewer sticks close enough to the template that Pitchford shares a screenplay credit with him here. Both versions get bogged down in silly speechifying, but in almost every respect Brewer's high fidelity cover version improves on the previous movie. It's sharper, punchier, better written and mostly better acted too. If anything the city-country cultural divide cuts deeper today than it did in the Reagan era, but Brewer shifts the action a few degrees south and navigates a more even-handed course between them. His small town, Bomont, Tennessee, is quite sympathetically drawn. And if the city by-laws prohibiting loud music, drink and public dancing make the local elders come off like the Taliban, Dennis Quaid's Reverend Moore is not the shrill evangelical caricature John Lithgow played, but a concerned parent and pastor who assumes responsibility for protecting his flock in the wake of a personal tragedy. As Ren, the urban hipster who is taken in by his uncle after his mom dies, Kenny Wormald doesn't eclipse Kevin Bacon's star-making performance, but he's an attractive actor who refrains from posturing. And he's a sensational dancer. ""Dancing with the Stars"" alum Julianne Hough -- who plays Ariel, the wild preacher's daughter -- has the trickier challenge of showing us a young woman acting out, sexually, and frankly seems a shade too mature to carry it off. That's partly Brewer's fault -- Ariel doesn't get the chance to explain herself until too late in the day, and it doesn't help that Hough seems to have been made up to look like a young Jennifer Aniston. But again, she comes into her own in the dance numbers. iReporter gives 'Footloose' a 3 out of 5 . Because he's cast real dancers, Brewer doesn't have to slice and dice the choreography: the music sequences (including eight new numbers and the four biggest hits from the 84 version) are dynamic and exciting. The choreography runs from line dancing to hip-hop and krumping, as well as a cute, funny sequence in which Ren's flat-footed buddy Willard (Miles Teller) learns rhythm from a posse of five-year-old girls. Granted, it could never best the original for, you know, originality, but now -- as then -- ""Footloose"" is an irresistible celebration of young bodies in motion. Altogether now: Loose, footloose, kick off your Sunday shoes...","Craig Brewer's ""Footloose"" is a fun remake of the 1984 classic .

"(CNN) -- Michelle Obama gave an impassioned speech before the International Olympics Committee. President Obama traveled overseas -- in the middle of debates over health care and Afghanistan -- to make his personal pitch to bring the 2016 Olympics to his hometown. President Obama personally appealed to IOC members for the 2016 summer Olympic Games to be in Chicago. But despite their efforts, the Obamas will come home empty-handed as Chicago's dreams of hosting the Games evaporated in the first round. The news stunned those awaiting the announcement, many of whom thought the battle was between Chicago, Illinois, and Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Rio also beat out Madrid, Spain, and Tokyo, Japan, to host the games. Although the White House says the trip was the right thing to do, some Republicans say it will have some consequences for the president. ""Other than people who like to cheer, 'We're No. 4! We're No. 4!' I don't know how this is anything but really embarrassing,"" Republican strategist Rich Galen said, adding that Obama's failed pitch will probably be the joke on Capitol Hill for weeks to come. ""Given the last two months starting with the August recess and all of the issues that surrounded that, I think that the White House staff, the senior staff needs to get together somewhere and figure out how they are going to fix this, because they are in a deep slump,"" he said. Upon returning to the White House on Friday, Obama expressed no regret about his trip, saying it is ""always a worthwhile endeavor to promote and boost the United States."" ""One of the things that I think is most valuable about sports is that you can play a great game and still not win,"" the president said. ""Although I wish that we had come back with better news from Copenhagen, I could not be prouder of my hometown of Chicago."" White House senior adviser David Axelrod said that although the results were ""disappointing,"" Obama did the best he could. ""The president made, I think, a very strong appeal, and it didn't work out. But it was well worth the effort. Any time this president has a chance to go and promote the interests of this country and promote the interests of a city or a state within this country on something of this magnitude, he's going to take that opportunity,"" he said. Axelrod said Obama's appeal wasn't strong enough to overcome the ""internal currents,"" pointing out that former IOC President Juan Antonio Samaranch was among those leading the bid to bring the games to Madrid. ""I think there were other things that played there that we simply couldn't overcome, and that's life. Life goes on,"" he said. U.S. Rep. Danny Davis, a Chicago Democrat, said the loss is ""kind of heartbreaking. ... A tremendous amount of effort has been put into trying to win the bid."" It wasn't a mistake for Obama to make the trip, Davis said. ""I think the president did what we would expect him to do, and that is show leadership,"" he said. Obama spent just four hours in Copenhagen and flew back before the announcement was made. The president also met with his commander in Afghanistan, Gen. Stanley McChrystal, aboard Air Force One, following up on a Wednesday meeting with his national security team on how to proceed on the war, the White House said. Before his trip, critics questioned whether Obama should leave the country to make his pitch, given his already full plate. ""Listen, I think it's a great idea to promote Chicago, but he's the president of the United States, not the mayor of Chicago,"" House Minority Leader John Boehner said, Politico reported. ""And the problems we have here at home affect all Americans, and that's where his attention ought to be."" Last month, when the Obamas hosted an event on the White House lawn to rally support for Chicago's bid, Obama was against making the trip. ""I would make the case in Copenhagen personally, if I weren't so firmly committed to making -- making real the promise of quality, affordable health care for every American,"" the president said. But the administration had little choice but to raise the stakes, White House officials said, given that the other competitors all were sending their heads of state to Copenhagen. CNN senior political correspondent Candy Crowley said Obama's failure to bring the Games to Chicago won't cause any enduring political damage. ""It opens him to criticism and it makes it difficult for him for a while. But will it mean NATO isn't going to send more troops to Afghanistan because he didn't get the Olympics? No. Does it mean that any Republican or Democrat will change their mind on health care? No. ""He's going to be in a lot bigger trouble if he doesn't deliver on health care, believe me,"" she said.","NEW: ""I could not be prouder of my hometown of Chicago,"" Obama says .

"(CNN) -- More and more, today's video game business is driven by huge military shooters like Activision's ""Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3"" and Electronic Arts' ""Battlefield 3."" Now, Erik Prince, the founder of a controversial, real-world military group, is stepping into the virtual war zone with a new first-person shooter, ""Blackwater."" Designed exclusively for Microsoft's Kinect for Xbox 360, ""Blackwater"" was developed by Zombie Studios and overseen by Prince, a former Navy SEAL. The shooter is set in a fictional North African town overrun by warlords and opposing militia forces. Players enter the fray as team members of Blackwater, the mercenaries-for-hire company that Prince founded in 1997. Featuring licensed real-world weapons, the game can be played with a traditional controller. But it has been crafted to take advantage of Kinect's motion controls. Gamers will be able to aim, crouch, and interact with the on-screen action using only body gestures and moves to take out enemies through a series of action-packed missions. The game has already courted controversy, since Blackwater employees were linked to the deaths of numerous noncombatants and civilians in the Middle East while employed by the U.S. government. Critics have complained about the game because Blackwater employees take on missions for money, while U.S. soldiers, the focal point of games like ""Modern Warfare 3"" and ""Battlefield 3,"" fight for their country. Following inquiries by Congress into Blackwater actions in Iraq and Afghanistan, including a shootout that led to the deaths of 17 Iraqis, Prince changed the company's name to Xe and, in 2009, resigned as CEO. He sold the company last year. Although the game was created with the aid of former Blackwater employees, the gameplay does not put players in situations where civilians or noncombatants are targets. The same cannot be said about ""Modern Warfare 2,"" which earned more than $1 billion for Activision a couple of years ago. That fictional game featured an intense airport sequence in which players were forced to target innocent civilians as an undercover terrorist or risk having their cover blown and being executed. Prince talked to CNN in an exclusive interview about the first shooter designed for Kinect, why he decided to enter the games business and what gadget he can't live without. CNN: Why did you decide to enter the video game business? Prince: Video games are an exciting medium. The creativity of design, the technology and the interaction represent the best of American innovation. My father was a brilliant inventor and businessman. He taught me to appreciate the opportunities that America offers to innovators. Working with the brilliant creators in this industry was a logical progression for me. CNN: How involved were you in this game? Prince: I set the overall vision and mission areas for this game. My guidelines were to be interactive, tactically correct, fun and expandable, meaning we can add additional missions and accessories to the game going forward. CNN: What did you learn about how video games are made from this experience? Prince: I now realize that the video game industry is very large and sophisticated, larger even than Hollywood in terms of volume. There is every aspect of specialization in the production of these games. Integrating physical motion into on-screen motion is an exciting new frontier for the industry. CNN: How do you think the Blackwater brand will appeal to the gaming demographic? Prince: I believe ""Blackwater"" will have a unique appeal to gamers, particularly on the Kinect platform. The physical, visual and virtual feel of participating in a mission brings a level of excitement and realism to the game that is hard to match. And frankly, it's fun. I think gamers will really enjoy playing the game. CNN: Do you play games or have any background playing games? If so, what have you played lately? Prince: I'm afraid I don't have time to play any games these days. I certainly played a lot when I was a kid and I know it helped develop my hand to eye coordination. CNN: What are your thoughts on how video games have evolved over the years? Prince: The video game industry is constantly evolving. The sheer creativity matched with cutting-edge technologies gives me the comfort that innovation is alive and well in America. And we can see the impact that the gaming industry is having on other entertainment media, as well as military training or flight simulation. It's a fascinating synthesis of ideas, technologies and platforms. CNN: How does this game being a Blackwater experience differentiate it from franchises like ""Call of Duty: Modern Warfare,"" ""Medal of Honor"" and ""Battlefield""? Prince: ""Blackwater"" on the Kinect system gets you up and moving. You'll have to act and react with something more than your thumbs. It is definitely the next step of progression into a truly interactive experience. CNN: Why do you think simulation military shooters are so popular today? ""Call of Duty"" is the biggest game franchise of all time. Prince: The popularity of simulation military shooters today is really no different from the popularity of playing soldier or cops-and-robbers when we were kids. Take timeless themes of courage, good vs. evil and war, and add today's technology and you get a very popular genre. We've taken the proven concept a step further with this game by having the player actually have to move their body to navigate the game. The military uses video games -- from America's Army online game to the new Dismounted Soldier Training System (which uses the Crytek game engine and virtual reality to train squads in war zones). CNN: What are your thoughts on the role games are playing in training in the military today? Prince: Training for any difficult job is essential. Combat being the most difficult, it's the same reason the Navy started the Top Gun program during Vietnam, because they were losing way too many new pilots during air combat. Top Gun, by giving pilots realistic experiences simulating combat, drastically improved their performance and survivability. With video game simulations, DOD is providing many of the same sights/sounds and system overloading experiences to soldiers before they encounter a real firefight so they are prepared to make good decisions in the middle of all that stress. CNN: Outside of work, what's a favorite piece of technology or gadget that you can't live without and why? Prince: My kids would certainly comment on my use (or overuse) of a BlackBerry and iPad.","Gamers can aim, crouch and interact with the on-screen action using only body gestures .
