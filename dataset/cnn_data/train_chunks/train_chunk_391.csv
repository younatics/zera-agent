"(CNN)The CIA's harsh interrogations of terrorist detainees during the Bush era didn't work, were more brutal than previously revealed and delivered no ""ticking time bomb"" information that prevented an attack, according to an explosive Senate report released Tuesday. The majority report issued by the Senate Intelligence Committee is a damning condemnation of the tactics -- branded by critics as torture -- the George W. Bush administration deployed in the fear-laden days after the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. The techniques, according to the report, were ""deeply flawed,"" poorly managed and often resulted in ""fabricated"" information. The report is reigniting the partisan divide over combating terrorism that dominated Washington a decade ago. Democrats argue the tactics conflict with American values while leading members of the Bush administration insist they were vital to preventing another attack. The CIA immediately hit back at the report, saying in a statement that the program was ""effective"" and substantially helped its understanding of al Qaeda's tactical operations and goals. But President Barack Obama said the report reinforced his view that the harsh interrogation methods ""were not only inconsistent with our values as a nation, they did not serve our broader counterterrorism efforts or our national security interests."" In its most graphic details, an executive summary of the report finds that conditions for detainees at top secret overseas interrogation sites were much harsher than the CIA has previously admitted. It finds that high value detainees were subjected to methods like waterboarding and sleep deprivation ""in near nonstop fashion for days or weeks at a time."" ""In many cases, the most aggressive techniques were used immediately, in combination and nonstop,"" the report says. ""Sleep deprivation involved keeping detainees awake for up to 180 hours, usually standing or in painful stress positions, at times with their hands shackled above their heads."" In one facility, a detainee was said to have died of hypothermia after being held ""partially nude"" and chained to a concrete floor, while at other times, naked prisoners were hooded and dragged up and down corridors while being slapped and punched. Multiple CIA detainees subjected to the techniques suffered from hallucinations, paranoia, insomnia and tried to mutilate themselves, the report says. On one occasion, high-value al Qaeda suspect Abu Zubaydah became completely unresponsive after a period of intense waterboarding. He had ""bubbles rising through his open full mouth,"" the report says. Meanwhile, the confessed mastermind of the September 11 attacks, Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, was subjected to a ""series of near drownings."" The report finds that at least 119 detainees went through the CIA detention program and at least 26 were held ""wrongfully,"" partly because there was no information to justify their detention. Previously, the CIA had said only 100 prisoners had been processed through the program, Democratic Senate aides said. The report suggests that the controversial enhanced interrogation techniques did not produce information necessary to save lives that was not already available from other means. That is important because supporters of the program have always said that it was vital to obtaining actionable intelligence from detainees that could not be extracted through conventional interrogations. It also discounts CIA claims in 2011 that enhanced interrogation of al Qaeda operative Hassan Ghul produced information which led them to Osama bin Laden's ""courier"" Abu Ahmad al-Kuwaiti. The breakthrough, which eventually helped the agency track down the al Qaeda leader's hideout in Abbottabad, Pakistan, was extracted before Ghul was subjected to harsh treatment, the report said, . In its scathing response to the report -- released even before Senate Intelligence Committee chairwoman Dianne Feinstein rose on the Senate floor to unveil it -- the CIA said it was ""unknowable"" whether it could have received the same information from terror suspects using alternative methods. It said the conclusions of the report contained ""too many flaws"" for it to ""stand as official record of the program"" and said many of the charges were ""based on authors' flawed analysis of the value of the intelligence obtained from the detainees."" Obama outlawed enhanced interrogation techniques soon after becoming President in 2009 and admitted in August ""we tortured some folks."" As commander in chief, he faces many of the same dilemmas on how to fight terrorism as his predecessor. But the tone of his response to the report was nevertheless critical. He acknowledged in his statement that the Bush administration had faced ""agonizing choices about how to pursue al Qaeda and prevent additional terrorist attacks against our country."" ""Our nation did many things right in those difficult years.  At the same time, some of the actions that were taken were contrary to our values. "" Feinstein said that the CIA's actions in the aftermath of 9/11 were a ""stain on our values and on our history."" ""The release of this 500-page summary cannot remove that stain, but it can and does say to our people and the world that America is big enough to admit when it's wrong and confident enough to learn from its mistakes,"" she said. In April, three Republicans on the Intelligence Committee voted to declassify the report. But Georgia Sen. Saxby Chambliss, the committee's top GOP member, also released a minority rebuttal to the document, taking issues with its methodology and findings. The rebuttal said the report created the ""false impression that the CIA was actively misleading policy makers and impeding the counterterrorism efforts of other federal government agencies during the Program's operation."" Director of National Intelligence James Clapper said he did not believe that ""any other nation would go to the lengths the United States does to bare its soul, admit mistakes when they are made and learn from those mistakes. "" Thousands of marines at U.S. diplomatic posts and military bases around the world are on alert amid fears the graphic details of how detainees were treated could spark a violent backlash. But there was little initial interest on Jihadi forums about the report, said Laith Alkhouri, a senior analyst at Flashpoint Partners, a U.S. organization that tracks Jihadi websites. Intelligence sources told CNN's Pentagon Correspondent Barbara Starr, however, that the threat of retaliatory attacks could come in days rather than hours, as information filters across the world. Those sources added that currently, there is no specific threat. The full report is more than 6,000 pages long. But after a prolonged tussle between the CIA and the committee over how much of the material should be classified, the document being released Tuesday is 480 pages long. Senior members of the Bush administration have also voiced disquiet that the report is being released and defended their actions, those of administration lawyers and CIA agents charged with the interrogations. Former president George W. Bush told CNN's Candy Crowley last week that the United States was ""fortunate to have men and women who work hard at the CIA serving on our behalf. These are patriots."" ""These are good people. Really good people."" Former Vice President Dick Cheney told the New York Times that claims that the CIA was out of bounds or that the interrogation program was a rogue operations were ""a bunch of hooey."" ""The program was authorized. The agency did not want to proceed without authorization, and it was also reviewed legally by the Justice Department before they undertook the program,"" Cheney said. Countries that cooperated with the CIA, hosting black site prisons and assisting in transferring detainees, are identified only obliquely and not by name. CIA employees, referred to by pseudonyms in the report, aren't being identified. However, the agency pushed for the pseudonyms to be redacted because other information in the report could be used to determine who the employees are. For some Republicans and CIA supporters, there's still a dispute about whether techniques such as waterboarding constitute torture. The Justice Department twice has investigated the conduct of CIA employees involved in the program and decided not to bring charges. CNN's Ed Payne, Jake Tapper and Jim Acosta contributed to this report.","Senate Intelligence Committee releases summary of torture report .

"President Barack Obama officially begins his second term today, a day ahead of his public swearing in and all the pomp and ceremony of a U.S. presidential inauguration. Because the Constitution calls for the president to be sworn in on January 20, Obama and Vice President Joe Biden will be sworn in for their second terms in relatively quiet ceremonies before they take their public oaths in front of the Capitol on Monday and before an audience spread down the National Mall. Obama's Monday address will lay out the values and vision for his second term and acknowledge the division in Washington but won't address policy, a source with knowledge of the speech told CNN on the condition of anonymity. He'll lay out policy in his February 12 State of the Union address, the source said. Obama to acknowledge divided Washington in inaugural address . Obama was still working on his speech on Saturday, the source said. The nation's first African-American president also will become only the 17th U.S. leader to deliver a second inaugural address before joining the traditional parade up Pennsylvania Avenue to the White House. For his second inauguration, less than half of the estimated 1.8 million onlookers who crammed the Mall in 2009 are expected -- organizers expect 800,000 people to attend Monday's public ceremony. 13 reasons to follow the inauguration on CNN platforms . The smaller crowd this time around reflects the reality of second-term presidencies, when the novelty and expectations of a new leader have been replaced with the familiarity and experiences of the first four years. Inauguration activities kicked off on Saturday with Obama and first lady Michelle Obama and Biden and his wife Dr. Jill Biden leading volunteers across the country in National Day of Service Activities. Obamas, Bidens participate in National Day of Service . The Obamas joined in a project at Burrville Elementary School in Washington, aiding volunteers who were staining a bookcase. Cameras at the school caught the president and first lady staining a bookcase. The president told volunteers that his family would do volunteer projects on holidays, ""So I was taught from a young age."" Volunteering ""is really what America is all about,"" he said. The Bidens helped to put together care packages for service members deployed overseas at the National Guard Armory in Washington. Biden's office said volunteers at the armory would produce 100,000 packages. ""We still have 68,000 troops in harm's way in some of the most godforsaken territory in the world,"" Biden said, adding that the military members can find comfort ""knowing that we back home just remember, we know what's going on."" Chelsea Clinton, honorary chairwoman of the Day of Service, said at a kickoff event on Mall that Saturday was the 19th anniversary of her father former President Bill Clinton signing the bill that designated a National Day of Service to coincide with Martin Luther King Jr. Day, the federal holiday honoring the late civil rights leader. ""When he signed the bill, he reminded us of what Dr. King called life's most persistent and urgent question: What are you doing for others?"" she said. ""And in my family, the only wrong answer to that question is 'nothing.' "" Later Saturday, singer Katy Perry headlined a concert for children of service men and women and Washington schoolchildren that was hosted by the first lady and Mrs. Biden. Singer Usher and the cast of the TV show ""Glee"" were among others who performed. Katy Perry brings 'Fireworks' to inauguration kids' concert . The Saturday event was to recognize the sacrifices and ""level of maturity that is required from military kids,"" the first lady said. ""It means always thinking about things that are so much bigger than yourself. It means growing up just a little faster and working just a little harder than other kids,"" she said. ""And it means doing the greatest thing you can ever do with your life at such a young age, and that is to serve our country."" On Sunday, the vice president will take his official oath shortly after 8 a.m. at the Naval Observatory, his official residence, and the president will take his at the White House shortly before noon. Obama and Biden will travel to Arlington National Cemetery after Biden's swearing-in for a traditional wreath-laying ceremony. In the evening, the Obamas will watch Latino acts at ""In Performance at the Kennedy Center,"" which is followed by the Let Freedom Ring concert. The Red, White and Blue Inaugural Ball and Hip-Hop Inaugural Ball are also scheduled in the capital. The president will speak to donors at a Candlelight Celebration and the National Building Museum on Sunday night. Viewer's guide to the inauguration . Monday's events will be a bit down-sized from Obama's first inauguration. After events in front of the Capitol, the Obamas and Bidens will lead the traditional parade down Pennsylvania Avenue to the White House, there are only two presidential balls this year, down from the 10 staged in 2009. While the anticipated crowd for Monday's events is expected to be about half of those who gathered four years ago, the temperature will be a bit higher than in 2009 when the high hovered around the freezing mark. While the early morning temperature will be in the 20s, the forecast calls for a high temperature in the upper 30s or low 40s. Still, organizers cautioned attendees to bundle up because of prolonged exposure to the cold as they watch the events and make their way to and from them.","President and vice president sworn in officially on Sunday before public ceremony on Monday .

"(CNN) -- Joan Rivers' personal throat doctor denies ""performing an unauthorized procedure"" before the comedian suffered cardiac arrest, a source close to the doctor told CNN. Dr. Gwen Korovin also ""categorically denies"" taking a selfie photo of Rivers while she was under anesthesia at a medical clinic, the source said Thursday. The statement disputes what a source close to the Rivers death investigation told CNN: that staff members at the clinic told investigators that Korovin snapped the selfie while Rivers was under anesthesia and also performed an unauthorized procedure on Rivers. Rivers, 81, died a week after suffering cardiac arrest during an appointment at Manhattan's Yorkville Endoscopy clinic. CNN's source close to the investigation also provided new details Thursday, including that Rivers was visible in Korovin's procedure room selfie. Clinic workers told investigators they heard Korovin make a statement to the effect that Rivers ""will think this is funny"" or ""would love this"" as she took the photo, the source said. Investigators do not have access to the phone Korovin used to take the photo, the source said. The procedures . The source also provided more specific information about what procedures were done on Rivers. Several clinic workers told investigators that it began with Korovin performing a laryngoscopy, which involves using a device to view a patient's vocal folds. Gastroenterologist Dr. Lawrence Cohen, who was the medical director of the clinic until resigning after Rivers' death, then performed an endoscopy intended to diagnose why she was suffering a sore throat and hoarseness, the source said. Cohen detected something of concern, the source said. Korovin then began a second laryngoscopy to again view River's vocal cords, the source said. It was at that time that her vocal cords began to swell, leading to a cutoff of oxygen to her lungs and ultimately to cardiac arrest, according to the source. The clinic denies published reports that a vocal cord biopsy was performed moments before Rivers went into cardiac arrest. Paramedics rushed Rivers from Yorkville Endoscopy to New York's Mount Sinai Hospital a mile away, where she was kept on life support until she died a week later. Korovin was authorized only to observe Cohen, who performed the procedure, since she was not certified by Yorkville Endoscopy clinic, as required by New York health law, the source said. Investigators have found no prior consent form signed by Rivers authorizing a procedure by Korovin, the source said. It was unclear if Rivers had given verbal consent to the biopsy before being sedated. Celebrity endorsements . Korovin is well known for helping an impressive list of celebrities with voice trouble. The list of famous patients who have sung her praises include actors Hugh Jackman and Nathan Lane and singers Celine Dion, Lady Gaga and Ariana Grande. The walls of Korovin's Manhattan medical office are covered with autographed photos, including from operatic tenor Luciano Pavarotti, Broadway star Barbara Cook and actress-singer Julie Andrews. ""I've always been fascinated by the human voice and music,"" Korovin, 55, is quoted telling the New York Daily News in a profile story last year. Korovin's lawyer sent a statement to CNN on Thursday in response to the reports: . ""Gwen S. Korovin, M.D. is a highly experienced, board certified otolaryngologist.  She maintains privileges at one of the city's most prestigious hospitals. She is respected and admired by her peers in the medical community and she is revered by her patients. ""As a matter of personal and professional policy, Dr. Korovin does not publicly discuss her patients or their care and treatment. Further, Dr. Korovin is prohibited by state and federal confidentiality laws from discussing her care and treatment of any particular patient. ""For these reasons, neither Dr. Korovin nor her attorneys will have any public comment on recent press reports regarding her practice. We ask that the press please respect Dr. Korovin's personal and professional policy of not discussing her patients, as well as the privacy of her patients."" Accreditation agency makes a visit . The American Association for Accreditation of Ambulatory Surgery Facilities (AAAASF) sent representatives for an unscheduled visit to the clinic after hearing about Rivers' cardiac arrest, according to letters from the group. The letters cited two ""deficiencies"" found by the representatives, declared the clinic to be in ""immediate jeopardy"" and placed it on ""emergency suspension."" The accreditation group said the clinic should stop procedures and surgeries ""until accreditation questions are settled."" The clinic, however, sent CNN a statement Friday acknowledging the visit by the accreditation groups and saying ""it is is in the process of implementing those steps"" requested by the group. The clinic's credentialing procedures have been revised after meeting with the accreditation agency's surveyors, it said. Yorkville Endoscopy is fully operational and under no suspension, the clinic's spokeswoman said. While the accreditation agency has no power to shut a clinic down, the state of New York does. State health investigators also found deficiencies in Rivers' treatment, according to a source close to the death investigation. These include the participation of Rivers' personal throat doctor. Timeline emerges in Joan Rivers' death . Yorkville Endoscopy issued a statement last Thursday denying reports that any vocal cord biopsy has ever been done at the clinic, although federal privacy law prevented any patient information from being released. The day after the denial was issued, the clinic confirmed that Cohen ""is not currently performing procedures. ... Nor is he currently serving as medical director."" The source said that at this time, neither Cohen nor the ear, nose and throat doctor have been accused of wrongdoing by investigators. Melissa Rivers has been silent since her mother's death on September 4, although she did post an online message thanking friends and fans Wednesday evening. ""As my son Cooper and I mourn the loss of my mother, we want to thank everyone for the beautiful cards and flowers conveying heartfelt messages and condolences, which continue to arrive from around the world and through social media. My mother would have been overwhelmed by the scope and depth of the love that people have expressed for her. It is certainly helping to lift our spirits during this time. ""We are forever grateful for your kindness and support in continuing to honor my mother's legacy, and for remembering the joy and laughter that she brought to so many.""

"House Speaker John Boehner on Thursday rebuked Iowa GOP colleague Rep Steve King for controversial comments on undocumented immigrants, calling the remarks ""deeply offensive and wrong,"" and acknowledged the fallout makes it harder to reach a deal on immigration reform. King, when discussing a proposal to give citizenship to the children of undocumented workers in an interview last week with Newsmax, suggested many of them were drug smugglers. ""For everyone who's a valedictorian, there's another 100 out there who weigh 130 pounds--and they've got calves the size of cantaloupes because they're hauling 75 pounds of marijuana across the desert,"" King asserted. Democrats immediately denounced the comments and Boehner released a written statement with similarly sharp criticism two days ago. But at a time when there is mounting pressure on House Republicans to address an overhaul of immigration policy, Boehner deliberately repeated the message before TV cameras at his weekly press conference. ""There is no place in this debate for hateful or ignorant comments from elected officials,"" Boehner said. He added that what King said ""does not reflect the values of the American people or the Republican Party. We all need to do our work in a constructive, open and respectful way."" Boehner and many other House Republicans are now backing a proposal that would allow children brought into the United States illegally by their parents to obtain citizenship. But King isn't backing off. He doubled down on Thursday, maintaining his remarks were based on facts. ""If people were offended, were they offended by the number or my choice of the fruit? And, if so,  what's offensive about the number or that?  I can't imagine why it's racist and if I offended anybody it was drug smugglers and it doesn't trouble me to offend drug smugglers.  If I intended to offend anybody that would be the group,"" King said. After speaking on the House floor, King didn't seem fazed by Boehner's comments. ""We know that the speaker responds to criticism in the press."" King said, adding that he would have preferred Boehner to approach him personally before speaking to the media. Many House Republicans quickly recognized the potential political damage King's remarks could have on the GOP as the party works to regain ground with Hispanic voters after losing badly among the group in the 2012 election. California Republican Rep Jeff Denham, who represents a district with a significant Latino population, concurred with Boehner in a tweet. ""@SpeakerBoehner is right. Rep. King's comments are hurtful & disrespectful. Lone member's prejudicial statements won't derail progress!"" The American Action Network, a GOP leaning group, released a poll on Wednesday that found a majority of Republicans in King's district backed a comprehensive approach to immigration reform. Without naming King, Dan Conston, the group's spokesman, sent a statement stressing the public support for legislation. ""Hopefully with knowledge like this, the most ardent opponents of reform will pause to consider what they can support and how they can play a constructive role in fixing this broken immigration system."" King brushed off the poll, and suggested the questions were crafted to get a specific response.  He admitted his office has been inundated with calls since the public coverage of his comments, and said to date the reaction has been slightly more negative, with 55 opposed and 45 supporting his position.","Rep.

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- A controversial Facebook page calling for another Palestinian intifada has been pulled off the social media website, following complaints from the Israeli government that it incited violence against Jews. A statement from Facebook said the group page entitled the ""Third Palestinian Intifada"" -- which had garnered more than 350,000 ""likes"" over the course of the past month -- was removed from the website because it contained direct calls for violence. ""The page... began as a call for peaceful protest, even though it used a term that has been associated with violence in the past.  In addition, the administrators initially removed comments that promoted violence,"" the company statement said.  ""However, after the publicity of the page, more comments deteriorated to direct calls for violence.  Eventually, the administrators also participated in these calls.  After administrators of the page received repeated warnings about posts that violated our policies, we removed the page. ""We continue to believe that people on Facebook should be able to express their opinions, and we don't typically take down content that speaks out against countries, religions, political entities, or ideas. However, we monitor pages that are reported to us and when they degrade to direct calls for violence or expressions of hate -- as occurred in this case -- we have and will continue to take them down,"" Facebook said. A few other identically named pages have popped up since then, some with the same messages the previous page had. The page's removal follows heavy criticism from the Israeli government and pro-Israel organizations that Facebook was ignoring its own terms-of-service guidelines, which prohibit the posting of content that is ""hateful, threatening, or... incites violence."" Yuli Edelstein, Israel's minister of public diplomacy and diaspora affairs, said Tuesday in a statement that the removal of the page showed that ""Facebook management understood that the page is a blunt abuse of freedom of speech to incite to violent actions."" The Anti-Defamation League also praised the move. ""By taking this action, Facebook has now recognized an important standard to be applied when evaluating issues of non-compliance with its terms of service involving distinctions between incitement to violence and legitimate calls for collective expressions of opinion and action,"" said a statement Tuesday from Abraham H. Foxman, national director of the group.  ""As it continues to monitor its pages, Facebook should be able to apply this standard in response to complaints about other pages with similar content.  We hope that they will continue to vigilantly monitor their pages for other groups that call for violence or terrorism against Jews and Israel."" Edelstein sent a letter to Facebook founder and chairman Mark Zuckerberg last week, complaining of content on the page that promoted ""the killing of Israelis and Jews and the 'liberating' of Jerusalem and of Palestine through acts of violence."" ""You are obviously aware of the site's great potential to rally the masses around good causes, and we are all thankful for that. However, such potential comes hand in hand with the ability to cause great harm such as in the case of the wild incitement,"" Edelstein's letter said. Edelstein's office had said Monday it was satisfied with moves the social media giant had made in monitoring the site and removing objectionable content. The Facebook page in question was set up in early March by a group of unidentified activists who called for a third intifada to start on May 15, a date known by Palestinians as the Nakba -- or catastrophe -- which commemorates the displacement of hundred of thousands of Palestinians from their homes in warfare that led to the establishment of Israel in 1948. The word intifada -- which is literally translated as ""shaking off"" -- is popularly used to describe a revolt or rebellion.  Palestinians have staged two intifadas, which began in 1987 and 2000 respectively. Violence surrounding the second intifada claimed the lives of thousands of Israelis and Palestinians. In an administrative post, the activists wrote that the purpose of the page was to liberate Palestine and fight ""against injustice, division, and corruption"" following the protest movements in Tunisia, Egypt, and Libya. In a March 24 post, the administrators said their approach was peaceful and that they were committed to maintaining freedom of expression.  They also suggested it was not fair to single out their page when thousands of pages on the social media website contained similar content, and threatened a mass Muslim boycott of Facebook if the page was pulled down.","NEW:  Facebook says it removed the page because it called for violence .

"Islambad, Pakistan (CNN) -- Two prominent Pakistani Muslim leaders threatened Wednesday to call for nationwide protests if the president pardons a Christian woman sentenced to death for insulting the Muslim prophet Mohammed. ""If the president pardons Asia Bibi, we will raise our voices across the country until he is forced to take his decision back,"" nationally known mufti Muneer Ur Rehman said. Hafiz Ibtisam Elahi Zaheer, a leading cleric in Lahore, said pardoning the woman would be ""criminal negligence"" and would cause inter-religious tension. Punjab Gov. Salman Taseer told CNN Tuesday that President Asif Ali Zardari would pardon Bibi if the High Court did not grant her request for mercy. Bibi, who has been jailed for nearly 15 months, was convicted in a Pakistani court earlier this month of breaking the country's controversial blasphemy law by insulting Islam's Prophet Mohammed, a crime punishable with death or life imprisonment, according to Pakistan's penal code. She was sentenced to death. A spokesman for Zardari said Wednesday that no action has been taken, but the president will pardon her if necessary. ""No decision has been taken,"" spokesman Farhatullah Babar said. ""Under the constitution, the president has to act under the advise of the prime minister. He will advise the president to take whatever action he proposes."" Babar said jurists and legal experts have debated about whether the president has absolute power under the constitution to grant a pardon. But he said Bibi is not in danger of being executed. ""Asia cannot be executed now,"" Babar said. ""Under the law, a death sentenced issued by a session court can not be carried out until it has been endorsed by the high court."" Farahnaz Ispahani, a spokeswoman for the president, said Pakistan remains committed to protecting religious minorities. ""Pakistan is a nation of many faiths and religions, and all Pakistanis, no matter what their religion, are equal under the law,"" Ispahani said in a written statement. ""President Zardari has followed the case of Asia Bibi closely and will take appropriate action, if necessary, to issue a pardon or grant clemency to insure that Asia Bibi is neither incarcerated or harmed."" A preliminary investigation showed Bibi was falsely accused, a government official said Monday. ""The president asked me to investigate her case, and my preliminary findings show she is innocent and the charges against her are baseless,"" Pakistani Minister for Minority Affairs Shahbaz Bhatti told CNN. Bhatti has said he will submit a final report Wednesday to Zardari's office. Prosecutors say Bibi, a 45-year-old field worker, insulted the Prophet Mohammed after she got into a heated argument with Muslim co-workers who refused to drink from a bucket of water she had touched because she is not Muslim. In a brief news conference at the prison where she's being held, Bibi said last weekend that the allegations against her are lies fabricated by a group of women who don't like her. ""We had some differences and this was their way of taking revenge,"" she said. Bibi's death sentence sparked outrage among human rights groups, who condemned Pakistan's blasphemy law as a source of violence and persecution against religious minorities. But Babar said the president's party lacks the power in parliament to repeal Pakistan's blasphemy laws. ""The manifesto of the Pakistan Peoples Party calls for the law to be repealed, but the party has not been able to repeal it because we lack the majority in parliament,"" Babar said. ""We don't have the numbers to do it."" Pakistan is more than 96 percent Muslim, according to the Pew Forum on Religion & Public Life. Journalist Nasir Habib contributed to this report.","NEW: Two Muslim leaders warn of protests if President Zardari frees Asia Bibi .

"For architecture buffs numbed by the ongoing global battle to crank out record-breaking tall buildings, here's something innovative to spark the imagination. The South Korean government has granted approval to begin construction on the world's first ""invisible"" tower. Designed by U.S.-based GDS Architects, the glass-encased Tower Infinity will top out at 450 meters (1,476 feet) and have the third highest observation deck in the world. The project is backed by Korea Land & Housing Corporation, a state-owned land and public housing developer. The invisibility illusion will be achieved with a high-tech LED facade system that uses a series of cameras that will send real-time images onto the building's reflective surface. It will be built just outside of Seoul near the Incheon International Airport. Neither the developer nor GDS have released a target completion date. The development will reportedly be used primarily for leisure activities. It will include a series of observation decks, a movie theater, roller coaster, water park and numerous food and beverage outlets. Though height isn't its main selling point, Tower Infinity is no slouch in the vertical department. When completed, it's expected to come in sixth on the list of the world's highest towers, behind Tokyo SkyTree, Guangzhou's CantonTower, Toronto's CN Tower, Moscow's Ostankino Tower and Shanghai's Oriental Pearl. Editor's note: The original version of this paragraph said Tower Infinity would be one of the world's tallest buildings, not towers. The error has been corrected.

"The new year will be the year the nation really starts to experiment with marijuana. It won't be the year legalization sweeps the country; it will be a year of wait and see. Indeed, 2014 will see the legalization movement gain greater political strength while facing the possibility of setbacks  if the implementation of new laws fails. It will also be a year of momentum-building. Advocacy groups will build on their recent ballot successes and work hard assisting implementation of new laws in Colorado and Washington. It may not be a flashy year; it may not be a headline-grabbing year, but it will be a critical year for the future of legalization advocacy. In 2013, Washington and Colorado built the administrative infrastructure to ready their states for the legal sale of marijuana after successful 2012 ballot initiatives. Those initiatives were among the biggest victories to date for the legalization movement. Of course, those successes didn't come about by accident. They were largely because legalization advocates -- over the course of many years -- transformed the movement into a mature, organized set of interest groups. These well-funded, expertly staffed groups showed themselves to be a political force with statewide ballot initiatives and increasingly in elections. Demonstrating the increasing acceptance of marijuana, the founder of a medical marijuana store, a respected businessman, was voted mayor of Sebastopol, California, last month. Opinion: Finally, a nation legalizes pot . Statewide victories were complemented by local-level initiatives. Successes in places like Portland, Maine, and Lansing, Michigan, will probably generate greater energy in other cities, like Washington, that are considering legalization. Building on this trend, groups will continue to develop as a politically savvy and powerful interest. In the world of lobbying, nothing breeds success (or raises funds) like prior success, and the past 14 months mean the movement will grow in numbers and financial capacity. On a grass-roots level, organizations like NORML and the Marijuana Policy Project will continue to show people that support for legalization is no longer taboo. Instead, it is a serious issue that deals with public health, regulation, taxation and budgeting. These groups have done well to frame the issue not as a dorm-room debate but as a public policy problem. Those efforts pull supporters out of the shadows; they will continue in 2014. In 2014, marijuana advocacy organizations will also continue to do something unheard of in today's American politics: unite Americans. This is one of the most remarkable, rarely discussed aspects of the movement. They don't just bring together like-minded Americans. They often bring together groups who normally bitterly oppose each other. Liberals join hands with libertarians. Wealthy white voters who see marijuana laws as outdated join with non-white voters who see the enforcement of marijuana laws as discriminatory. Children of the 1960s join with their grandchildren who won't retire until even as late as the 2060s. On many issues, these groups have different views, but on legalization, many people find common ground. All those who think it should be legal to inhale may be the ones who breathe fresh air into American politics. They will produce policy solutions in a system that consistently fails to do anything of note. The gains for supporters of legalization will be on display in 2014. But something else will happen behind the scenes this year that will be absolutely critical for the movement. Advocates are planning statewide efforts, similar to those in Colorado and Washington. Organizations in places like Oregon and Massachusetts, among other states, are considering legalization ballot initiatives in the coming years. However, elected officials and voters may well take a wait-and-see approach. Colorado's and Washington's experiences will affect voters in future legalization efforts. If those states have a positive experience with legalization -- dispelling opponents' concerns about addiction, traffic safety and crime --- and it adds to their budgets,  others will be more open to legalization. Advocacy groups will face a flourishing political landscape. If, however, the experiences in those states are negative -- implementation goes awry, programs become cost-inefficient or public health concerns arise --  the movement will stumble. Advocates are not leaving that outcome to chance. In a show of how serious they are about legalization-as-public-policy, they are actively assisting states in implementation. If the movement will continue to succeed, it must be actively committed to making implementation work and work well. If the experience of the Affordable Care Act in 2013 has shown us anything, it is that implementation matters. Botched rollouts, unforeseen bumps in the road and other challenges hurt advocates and embolden opponents. In this way, 2014 is the start of experimentation with marijuana. It might not be a flashy year for the movement or the opposition. But 10 years from now, legalization advocates may look back at this year and note that it was make or break for the movement, making 2014 one of the most crucial years for marijuana policy.","2014 is the year the nation starts to experiment with legal marijuana, John Hudak says .

"Since Sir Edmund Hillary and his Sherpa guide, Tenzing Norgay, first conquered Mount Everest in 1953, thousands of trekkers have tried to follow their footsteps. According to the Nepalese Ministry of Culture, Tourism and Civil Aviation, more than 3,500 have successfully climbed the 8,848-meter (29,029-foot) mountain, the world's highest. More than a tenth of that number scaled the summit last year alone. But with the mountaineers' lofty dreams come a price: a trail of trash that now threatens the peak's environment. A group of 15 artists in Nepal are turning that trash into art. Under a project called ""Mt. Everest 8848 Art Project I"" created last year, they have collected 1.5 tons of garbage brought down by climbers from the mountain, including remains of a helicopter that had crashed into the slopes during the 1970s. ""With this collaboration we aimed to raise awareness about pollution at Everest,"" explained Kripa Rana Shahi, director of Da Mind Tree, the organization that initiated the project. Working tediously for a month, the artists transformed oxygen cylinders, cans, glass bottles and discarded trekking tools into 74 pieces of art and held their first of many exhibitions for interested buyers in November 2012. Geographer reaches Mount Everest summit amidst tragedy . ""Many of the artworks reflect mountain life and mountaineering experiences,"" says artist Sushma Shakya. ""It was interesting what we came up with, and how this trash could turn into something beautiful."" ""The visitors are amazed by the artwork, and we've received encouraging feedback. We hope our creations will help inspire actions against pollution at the Everest,"" Nara Bahadur BK, another artist, said. The exhibitions have attracted more than 3,800 visitors, with the pieces priced from $17 to $2,400. Nineteen pieces have been sold so far, and part of the proceeds will be given to Everest Summiteers Association, which has collaborated with the project. The association was the first to initiate a cleanup trip to Mt. Everest in 2005 and has continued its efforts to make the mountain pollution free. ""Each expedition to Everest is required to take a garbage deposit and bring their waste back,"" Diwas Pokhrel, the group's general secretary, said. ""But this system has not been strictly implemented."" In last two years, the association has collected over 10 tons of garbage from the Everest, but it estimates that another 10 tons are still littering the slopes. According to the association, biodegradable garbage is separated from the collection and turned into compost at Namche Bazaar, the major stop point before the base camp. But much of the garbage comprises non-degradable items such as oxygen cylinders, tin cans, and plastic and glass bottles. These are airlifted to Nepal's capital, Kathmandu. Turning trash into art is one way of managing waste. Da Mind Tree says it will continue working on similar projects. ""We hope our creative works of art will inspire and encourage people to keep the mountains clean,"" Shahi said.

""We haven't made any final decision about that piece or any other piece."" She emphasized the total spent on art at new embassies amounts to just 0.5% of the embassy's total construction budget. The Art in Embassies program was started in the 1960s to showcase American art around the world, and also features pieces from local host-country artists. According to the State Department, over 58 permanent collections have been displayed at embassies and ambassadors' residences, and dozens of temporary exhibitions are shipped every year under the program. Over $300 million worth of art is also on loan to diplomatic facilities by the artists themselves, according to Harf. ""Obviously, we believe very strongly in the Art in Embassies program,"" she said. ""We think it fosters cultural connections.""

"Jurors hearing the Michael Jackson wrongful death trial got a stark look at the dead pop icon after a lawyer showed them an autopsy photo. Jackson's unclothed corpse lying on a coroner's table looked nothing like the world's most famous entertainer. The doctor who conducted Jackson's autopsy will return to the witness stand Wednesday. On Tuesday, jurors are hearing from another doctor in the trial to decide whether concert promoter AEG Live shares blame in Jackson's death with Dr. Conrad Murray. The witness on the stand Tuesday is cardiologist Dr. Daniel Wohlgelernter, who is offering expert analysis of Murray's skills and decisions. Murray was not the ""appropriate physician"" for AEG to hire as Jackson's tour doctor because he was a cardiologist and  not  trained to treat the singer's special needs, Wohlgelernter testified. ""Michael Jackson had a history of substance abuse, addiction to medications and sleep disturbance,"" he said, not heart or cardiovascular problems. Murray's agreement to close down his Las Vegas clinic to work full time for Jackson created a conflict, he said.  The agreement said Murray could lose his job if the tour was delayed or canceled. ""It meant that Dr. Murray was entirely dependent on the continuation of the tour for his income,"" he said. Much of what jurors heard for the first time from Dr. Christopher Rogers Monday is a repeat of the scientific evidence presented in the trial of Murray, who is now serving a prison sentence for involuntary manslaughter. But some of what is in the coroner's report seems to give more insight into Michael Jackson's life rather than how he died. Rogers noted in his autopsy report that Jackson's lips were tattooed pink, while his eyebrows were a dark tattoo. The front of his scalp was also tattooed black, apparently to blend his hairline in with the wigs he wore. The autopsy confirmed what Jackson told people who questioned why his skin tone became lighter in the 1980s. Jackson had ""vitiligo, a skin pigmentation disease,"" Rogers said. ""So, some areas of the skin appear light and others appear dark."" Debts, drugs, messy bedroom highlighted in Jackson trial . Jackson lawyer Michael Koskoff made sure the jury heard that, even though it had nothing to do with how he died. Jackson's mother and three children are suing AEG Live, contending the company that was promoting his ""This Is It"" shows was liable for his death because of the negligent hiring, retention and supervision of Murray. AEG Live argues that Jackson chose Murray as his tour doctor and that the company had no way of knowing he was using the surgical anesthetic propofol to put the singer to sleep each night. Rogers concluded that a propofol overdose killed Jackson, although several sedatives Murray gave him that morning contributed to his death. Los Angeles coroner's toxicologist Dan Anderson, who studied the drugs in Jackson's body, testified Monday that the level of propofol found in Jackson's body was ""consistent with major surgery anesthesia."" Propofol is a dangerous drug when not used properly, he said. Money woes may have led Murray to 'break the rules,' detective says . The Los Angeles coroner's office found 31 deaths in the last 14 years in which propofol was found in a body, including six suicides committed by medical personnel -- doctors, nurses and anesthesiologists -- who chose the drug to end their lives, Anderson said. There have also been several homicides with propofol, including ""a mercy killing"" in a hospital, he testified. If not for his death by propofol, Jackson's health appeared good enough for him to live a normal lifespan, Rogers testified. ""There was no indication from the autopsy that there was anything anatomically wrong with him that would lead to premature death,"" Rogers said. He had no signs of being addicted to street drugs, such as needle marks or disease, he said. That testimony is important for the Jackson case, because if the jury decides that AEG is liable in his death, his expected lifespan will be key to calculating damages. Jackson lawyers will contend that he would have made billions of dollars in his remaining years through several more world tours, merchandizing, recording and movies.","Conrad Murray was the wrong doctor for Michael Jackson, expert says .

"The prices may look tempting, but ordering from an online pharmacy is often a bad deal, according to Interpol and the U.S Food and Drug Administration, announcing a crackdown Thursday on thousands of websites. The FDA said it has shut down 1,677 sites for selling counterfeit or substandard medication, or for selling drugs without appropriate safeguards. Other sites received regulatory warnings. Officials said they also arrested 58 people and seized more than $41 million worth of illegal medicines. Several sites had sleek interfaces and names that could easily be confused with legitimate pharmacy retailers. For example, the FDA shuttered Walgreens-Store.com; the well-known drugstore chain's website is actually Walgreens.com. ""It impacts consumers every day,"" FDA Commissioner Margaret Hamburg told CNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta. ""These products can have none of the active ingredient that people need for the treatment of their disease. They can have too much or too little (of the ingredient); they can have toxic ingredients, and they can prevent patients form getting the actual medications that they badly need to treat their disease."" The most common scams advertised popular drugs such as Viagra, Levitra, Celebrex and Avandaryl. The recent crackdown, labeled Pangea VI, involved the cooperation of more than 100 countries, according to Interpol. Hamburg acknowledged it's difficult to know the scope of the online pharmacy problem but maintained, ""We still do have the safest drug supply in the world."" At some locations, FDA and customs agents use handheld scanners with ultraviolet and infrared radiation to detect suspicious packaging and ingredients. Confirmation of whether a product contains fake ingredients must be done in a laboratory. The scanners are in use at a handful of locations that handle a large volume of imports such as the Los Angeles International Airport. The FDA also works closely with private pharmaceutical companies, such as Pfizer, that run investigations and turn over evidence to law enforcement. Pfizer declined to say how much it spends on tracking counterfeits or how many people are working on the investigations. Counterfeits are not isolated to online sales, and it is extremely difficult to know how many deaths and serious illnesses they cause. Unless a patient's adverse reaction is dramatic, the medication is usually not tested, so the vast majority of counterfeit ingredients likely go unnoticed. But many experts agree the problem is daunting. The National Association of Boards of Pharmacy recently performed an analysis of more than 10,000 websites, and found that 97% did not fully comply with state and federal regulations. It said 88% did not require a valid prescription, and almost half sold medicines lacking FDA approval. ""It's probably a multibillion dollar industry,"" said Carmen Catizone, executive director of the pharmacy board group. Catizone said most of these sites are based overseas, with a common scam of site operators presenting themselves as Canadian to lure U.S. customers seeking more affordable medication from a trusted place. ""The fact of the matter is very few, if any, of these sites are actually based in Canada or (are) Canadian,"" Catizone said. ""In fact, they are located in China, India, Pakistan, around the world."" The National Association of Boards of Pharmacy's website features a list of approved online pharmacies as well as those to avoid. Hamburg said consumers should also watch for a few warning signs. ""No. 1, the websites should ask for a valid prescription. If they don't -- beware."" She also said website pharmacies should have a licensed pharmacist available for consultation and should be located in the United States and licensed in the state where the website is registered. Beyond that, she said, the basics still apply. ""If the costs are really low, if it seems too good to be true, it is too good to be true,"" she said.","Sites shut down for selling counterfeit or substandard medication, FDA says .

"(CNN) -- A video apparently showing a young woman throwing live puppies into a river has sparked outrage across the Internet. And now it has also led to an animal rights group offering a bounty for the arrest of the people behind it. People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals has offered a reward for information leading to the capture and arrest of the people behind what it calls a ""heinous act"" of cruelty. ""Animal abusers are cowards,"" PETA Manager Martin Mersereau said in a news release announcing the $2,000 reward. ""They take their issues out on the most defenseless beings available to them."" In the video, a girl in a red hooded sweatshirt is seen throwing at least six puppies into a fast-moving river. She appears to speak Croatian, while repeatedly picking live animals from a bucket and throwing the squealing puppies into the water. It's not clear what eventually happened to them. CNN could not independently verify the authenticity of the video. The tape was originally posted on YouTube, but was quickly pulled down. It is still widely available online and has gone viral, with sites such as LiveLeak.com registering more than 1.3 million views of the footage. Watch video on LiveLeak.com . Web users have banded together on sites like 4chan.org to help identify the woman and the off-camera man who filmed it. PETA says that clues in the video and the original post indicate that it may have been filmed near the Vrbas River in Bosnia-Herzegovina. A facebook page dedicated to helping track them down had more than 7,000 people sign up since the video was posted Monday. Users of the 4chan.org site have been in the news recently for identifying the person behind a similar incident involving a British woman caught on a security camera throwing a cat in a trash can last week.","A young woman is filmed throwing at least six squealing puppies into the water .

"(CNN) -- Forget Disneyland! Costa Rica is the happiest place in the world, according to an independent research group in Britain with the goal of building a new economy, ""centered on people and the environment."" Costa Rica is known for its lush rain forests and pristine beaches. In a report released Saturday, the group ranks nations using the ""Happy Planet Index,"" which seeks countries with the most content people. In addition to happiness, the index by the New Economics Foundation considers the ecological footprint and life expectancy of countries. ""Costa Ricans report the highest life satisfaction in the world and have the second-highest average life expectancy of the new world (second to Canada),"" the organization said in a statement. They ""also have an ecological footprint that means that the country only narrowly fails to achieve the goal of ... consuming its fair share of the Earth's natural resources."" The Central American country, tucked between Nicaragua and Panama, touts its lush rain forests and pristine beaches. Its president, Oscar Arias Sanchez, won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1987 for trying to help end civil wars in several Central American countries. This year's survey, which looked at 143 countries, featured Latin American nations in nine of the Top 10 spots. The runner-up was the Dominican Republic, followed by Jamaica, Guatemala and Vietnam. Most developed nations lagged in the study. While Britain ranked 74th, the United States snagged the 114th spot, because of its hefty consumption and massive ecological footprint. The United States was greener and happier 20 years ago than it is today, the report said. Other populous nations, such as China and India, had a lower index brought on by their vigorous pursuit of growth-based models, the survey suggested. ""As the world faces the triple crunch of deep financial crisis, accelerating climate change and the looming peak in oil production, we desperately need a new compass to guide us,"" said Nic Marks, founder of the foundation's center for well-being. Marks urged nations to make a collective global change before ""our high-consuming lifestyles plunge us into the chaos of irreversible climate change."" The report, which was first conducted in 2006, covers 99 percent of the world population, the statement said.","Costa Rica beats out Dominican Republic as ""happiest"" place in world .

"The twin brothers who lost their HGTV show after a recording surfaced of one's anti-homosexuality views are surprisingly not upset at the network that fired them. Their beef is not with HGTV, but with the gay ""agenda"" that ""bullied"" the network, Jason and David Benham told CNN's ""New Day"" on Friday. ""I feel they got bullied,"" David Benham said. ""There's an agenda that's out in America right now that demands silence, especially from men and women who profess Jesus Christ and hold to his standards."" Their dismissal from the show they were scheduled to host added fuel to the debate over people losing their jobs for what they say about their personal lives. It's not a free speech issue, as both sides mostly agree that people have the right to say what they want, but a question of how severe the consequences for unpopular positions should be. HGTV was within its rights to let the Benham brothers go, but maybe it shouldn't have, Ellis Henican, a Newsday columnist, told ""New Day."" ""Do they have a legal right? Yes. Should we be cheering it? No, we should not. We ought to be big enough people that we can see people we don't agree with, let them fix their houses, help the nice people. What are we scared of?"" Henican said. The brothers ran afoul of the network after the site Right Wing Watch published a post about the pair, labeling David Benham as an ""anti-gay, anti-choice extremist"" for reportedly leading a prayer rally in 2012 outside of the Democratic National Convention in Charlotte, North Carolina. The site posted a recording of Benham talking to a talk show host about ""homosexuality and its agenda that is attacking the nation"" and ""demonic ideologies"" taking hold in colleges and public schools. Benham also discusses the fight for North Carolina's Amendment One, which involved a ban on same-sex marriage and civil unions in the state constitution. The Benham brothers were the planned stars of the HGTV show ""Flip It Forward,"" set to premiere in October, in which they would have helped families purchase homes they otherwise could not afford. ""When the firestorm came in, we had an opportunity to speak with HG and the folks over there and explain to them who we were as people,"" Jason Benham said. ""We sell to all people of all kinds, and that we would be glad to take a homosexual couple onto our show."" Peter Shankman, a branding and social media consultant, told ""New Day"" that the decision probably boiled down to money. ""This is HGTV scared because they saw what happened with Paula Deen, they saw what happened with ""Duck Dynasty,"" and this is a ... move to make sure that this doesn't come back to bite them,"" he said, referring to the controversies for offensive comments made by the stars on their respective shows. ""This is about money,"" he said. ""And if you are going to come out and say something that is against a big section of the population, love it or hate it, you're going to not have that right to give that talk, to get that show, to do whatever."" The show's producers knew about the brothers' views and went ahead with them as hosts until the controversy went public, the Benhams said. ""We don't feel wronged at all. This isn't HG versus us, or us against the gay community. This is an agenda, and we're getting to witness it right now,"" Jason Benham said. Their comments have never been aimed at gays, but at an agenda that says you can't stand by your beliefs, Jason Benham said. ""It's only going to get worse because there is an agenda that wants to silence the beliefs that we have,"" he said.","Jason and David Benham say they are not upset at HGTV .

"(CNN) -- ""I am like, I am so (BLEEP) high. This is terrible. And I did it in that voice. And I have never done that voice before in my life. I don't know where that voice came from. But I heard myself use that voice. And in my mind, I went, oh (BLEEP). I just gave myself Down syndrome.""  --Wyatt Cenac, This American Life, 5/4/2014 . It's hard to build a more inclusive society when people keep making fun of you. Even as people with disabilities and their allies make progress in so many ways, disability remains a target for mockery. Over the last few days, a baby boy with Down syndrome named Gammy has been all over the news. He and his twin sister were born to a surrogate mother in Thailand, but allegedly when their Australian parents discovered the boy's genetic condition, they left him behind. To the biological parents, it seems, the words ""Down syndrome"" meant that he was not worth being their son. These are the stakes involved in how we talk and think about disability, how we portray disability in the media, not to mention in our schools and homes. I'm the father of a boy with Down syndrome. I remember weeping when I heard the diagnosis. My mother said she couldn't stop thinking about how he'd be taunted and bullied as he got older. Her experience of people with intellectual disabilities was that they were targets for cruel humor. The good news is that in recent years, sustained awareness campaigns against dehumanizing speech, coupled with some 20 years of inclusive education since the passage of the Americans With Disabilities Act in 1990, have made things a lot better in America. No one is likely to call my son the r-word to his face. The bad news is that perhaps we have focused too much on explicit language without addressing the deeper questions of portrayal and representation. Too often, people with disabilities are marginalized and excluded. Instead of focusing on a single word, we've got to work to unravel the prejudices beneath the surface. Last May, Wyatt Cenac, former ""Daily Show"" correspondent and comedian, appeared on ""This American Life,"" a popular show on National Public Radio. He told a story about a bad experience eating a pot brownie. The joke was that it made him talk, uncontrollably, in a funny voice, as if he had Down syndrome. Next, Cenac, broke the flow of the piece in order to issue a kind of disclaimer. He said: . ""Now let me just say, I know what Down syndrome is. I know that Down syndrome is something that you're born with when you are born with an extra chromosome. I know all that information. I knew that information then. But something about eating this brownie made me think that somehow I had grown an extra chromosome and I now had adult-onset Down syndrome. And for people who have Down syndrome, it's something they grow up with. And they grow up and they have healthy and happy lives. I just got it."" Then he went right back to his fake voice, slurring words, and sounding confused. Cenac did not respond to emails asking for a comment. [He has since commented on the piece here.] And the host of the show, Ira Glass, declined to comment for this piece. Glass did write, however, to Julie Ross, the mother of a child with Down syndrome. She shared that e-mail with me. Glass wrote: . ""I agree with you completely that nobody should have to listen to stories that mock and denigrate (people with Down syndrome) This was a concern for me and my producers when we were working with Wyatt Cenac. We talked about it as we shaped the story."" He then notes that Cenac went out of his way to make the disclaimer, claims that Cenac is making himself the butt of the joke, and that, ""The only thing that possibly could be offensive is his imitation of what a person with Down syndrome sounds like, and again -- we may disagree about that -- I think that's fair game for a comedian."" Glass and Cenac used the disclaimer, used the statement that they know what Down syndrome is, medically, as a way to protect themselves from criticism. However, as Glass admits, the humor of this piece depends on making fun of the way that some people with Down syndrome speak. Since my son was very young, we've worked for so many hours on his speech. Together, we've worked with many therapists to carve out individual phonemes, tones, sounds and finally words. Each tiny advance takes months. I wept when I heard him say, ""I love you"" for the first time, even though it was in a slurred, indistinct voice of the exact type that Cenac was mocking. Moreover, speech is so fraught, because intelligibility -- how clearly my son can communicate with strangers -- determines what kind of independence will be possible for him as an adult. There is no disclaimer that can take the sting out of Cenac's joke. He and Glass can decide that the humor of the piece is worth being offensive, but they don't get to determine whether the hurt is real or just. Neither do the many comics that rely on punching down, using mockery of people marginalized by ability, race, religion, gender or sexuality to get a laugh. Cenac isn't alone. Ricky Gervais, in the British TV show ""Derek,"" plays a man who appears to be disabled. Derek is supposed to be a positive example, but much of the comedy extends from his disabled physicality -- a hunched back, a slacked toothsome mouth, and a shuffling walk. Other laughs come from his cluelessness as he cheerily staggers through uncomfortable scenes. Gervais has said he doesn't mean to make fun of people with intellectual disabilities, saying in an interview, ""I've never considered him disabled; he is a 'out of the mouth of babies' innocent person who always says the right thing that you didn't see coming. And if I say he's not disabled, that's the end of it."" That's not the end of it. Not for Gervais. Not for Cenac. In the end, it doesn't matter whether a comedian uses a diagnostic term, issues a disclaimer, or claims to be the butt of the joke. Humor can reinforce stereotypes or destroy them. When you make fun of attributes associated with disability, you might as well just be standing on stage, shouting the r-word.","David Perry: It's hard to build inclusive world when people mock Down syndrome .

"Tuesday's Senate primary in Kansas ended another ugly showdown that pit a tea party-backed challenger against an establishment Republican incumbent. CNN projects incumbent Sen. Pat Roberts has fended off conservative challenger Milton Wolf in the state's GOP Senate primary. In his victory speech Roberts said that ""we celebrate tonight"" and that ""we have another job starting first thing tomorrow."" ""That job is to unite Republicans under a common and vital cause,"" he said. ""Unity must happen if we are to keep Kansas red. It must happen if we are going to defeat an Obama agenda and send Harry Reid back!"" The race saw controversies over residency and Facebook photos and a rare streetside confrontation. Roberts' win leaves only Thursday's nominating contest in Tennessee, where incumbent Lamar Alexander faces a bunch of conservative challengers, for a tea party-backed candidate to prevail in Senate primaries. Wolf's campaign for months tried to portray Roberts as more in tune with Washington than Kansas, pointing to reports from earlier this year that the senator listed his voting address at the home of two longtime political supporters who rent a room to him. Wolf said in his concession speech that ""while we came up short tonight, I believe our battle just begins."" ""I believe we're just getting warmed up,"" he said to his supporters. ""I believe we're going to save this country because it's up to us. Our republic needs us to stand up and fight and it is the greatest honor of my life to stand shoulder to shoulder with you,"" he said. ""To run towards the screaming instead of away. And I will always stand up and fight for our country and fight for our state. And it is the biggest honor of my life to say that I stood with you."" Still, Roberts was seen as the heavy favorite in the nomination battle with a large double-digit lead in the most recent poll. A couple of other minor candidates were also on the ballot. Dueling controversies . The Wolf campaign ran numerous ads attacking Roberts over his residency. At the same time, the Roberts' campaign over the past couple of months went up with TV ads reminding voters that Wolf, a radiologist, posted X-ray images of mortal injuries and made light of them and the victims. Wolf was later forced to admit he made ""insensitive"" comments. Wolf painted himself as a conservative activist with the guts to stand up to the GOP establishment. As a doctor, he frequently campaigned against the Affordable Care Act and proposed his own plan that he calls ""PatientCare."" He enjoyed the backing and the support of some major national tea party groups, such as the Tea Party Patriots and the Tea Party Express, and some influential anti-establishment organizations, like the Senate Conservatives Fund and the Madison Project. Roberts enjoyed the support of the National Republican Senatorial Campaign, which is chaired by fellow Kansas Republican Sen. Jerry Moran. Showdown on the street . In the closing weeks of the primary campaign, Wolf highlighted what he said was Robert's refusal to debate him. Last week, Wolf changed his travel plans at the last minute to confront Roberts as he met with business leaders in Emporia, Kansas. ""You told Kansans you would give them your word and you would give them a debate,"" Wolf said to Roberts. ""You have said it multiple times in multiple places. You tell us that you are tough and you're tested and trusted. And I want you to keep your word on that, I want you to debate. I think Kansans deserve it."" ""Milton, Milton, Milton, Milton,"" Roberts said dismissively. ""This is not the time. We have a regularly-scheduled event, a listening tour event. This is not the time."" ""When would be the time, senator, because I'll go anywhere you'd like. You've given your word to debate. Let's just debate,"" Wolf continued as Roberts walked off. Roberts' campaign was asked why he wouldn't debate. ""The question's not about debating. The question is about an immature candidate with a desperate campaign, an unethical candidate pulling stunts like he did today. When you're 20 points down, these are the kind of desperate stunts you pull,"" spokesman Sean Fitzpatrick said. 2014 tea party challenges . The primary in Kansas comes six weeks after longtime Sen. Thad Cochran of Mississippi narrowly won re-nomination, edging out tea party-backed state Sen. Chris McDaniel in a runoff. McDaniel officially contested the results of the June primary runoff on Monday after revealing alleged evidence of voter fraud and irregularities. While the Kansas contest has made some headlines, it pales in comparison to the Mississippi showdown, which played out in the national political spotlight. More primary highlights . Also in Kansas, Rep. Mike Pompeo beat former congressman Todd Tiahrt in the Republican primary for the state's 4th Congressional District, CNN projects. Tiahart held the seat for 16 years before giving it up to run for the Senate, ultimately losing in 2010 to Jerry Moran. Voters in Michigan, Missouri and Washington also voted Tuesday in their respective state's primary contest. Here are some of the highlights: . In Michigan's 3rd Congressional District, the familiar 2014 narrative -- tea party challenger takes on establishment GOP incumbent -- was turned on its head. Challenger Brian Ellis, a businessman who has support from the Chamber of Commerce, tried to unseat two-term Rep. Justin Amash, a libertarian who won his seat in the 2010 tea party wave that landed Republicans in the House majority. But despite being outspent, Amash staved off his establishment-backed challenger. Debbie Dingell, a Democrat, declared victory Tuesday in Michigan's 12th Congressional District against opponent Raymond Mullins. She announced plans earlier this year to run for the seat being vacated by her husband, Rep. John Dingell, the longest serving member of Congress in history.","Incumbent Sen.

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- Rapper T.I. was arrested on federal gun charges just hours before he was scheduled to perform at the BET Hip Hop Awards, according to federal authorities. T.I., whose real name is Clifford Harris, was arrested without incident in midtown Atlanta. The entertainer, whose real name is Clifford Harris, was arrested in a federal sting Saturday after his bodyguard-turned-informant delivered three machine guns and two silencers to the hip-hop star, according to a Justice Department statement. Authorities said that Harris, 27, provided the bodyguard $12,000 to buy the weapons, which Harris is not allowed to own because he is a convicted felon. Court documents said Harris was convicted on felony drug charges in 1998, and a federal affidavit said he has been arrested on gun charges in the past. However, one of his attorneys, Dwight Thomas, said Sunday he was not aware Harris was a convicted felon and that ""a number of people"" live in Harris' suburban Atlanta home. Thomas added there were ""two sides to every story -- sometimes three"" and he was confident the legal system would work in Harris' favor. The entertainer was taken into custody about 2:30 p.m. ET Saturday in Atlanta, where the BET award show was filmed. Harris, the show's top nominee, was up for nine awards, including CD of the year and lyricist of the year. He also was scheduled to perform, along with fellow rap stars Common, Nelly and Kanye West. The show went on without the self-proclaimed ""King of the South,"" whose car and College Park, Georgia, home were searched following his arrest.  Watch a search of the rapper's home » . Authorities said they found three more firearms in the car in which Harris drove to pick up the machine guns and silencers, ""including one loaded gun tucked between the driver's seat where Harris had been sitting and the center console."" At his home, authorities found six other guns, five of them loaded, in his bedroom closet. ""Machine guns pose a serious danger to the community, which is why they are so carefully regulated,"" said David Nahmias, U.S. attorney for the Northern District of Georgia. ""The last place machine guns should be is in the hands of a convicted felon, who cannot legally possess any kind of firearm. This convicted felon allegedly was trying to add several machine guns to an already large and entirely illegal arsenal of guns."" The sting came after Harris' bodyguard was arrested purchasing the machine guns and silencers from an undercover Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives agent Wednesday, according to the Justice Department statement. The bodyguard then agreed to cooperate with the ATF, the statement said. The guns were not registered on the National Firearms Registration and Transfer Record as required by law. The bodyguard -- who has worked for Harris since July -- told authorities he had bought about nine guns for the rap star in the past, the statement said. On Wednesday, authorities said, Harris arranged for the bodyguard to pick up $12,000 in cash from a bank to buy the guns. After his arrest, the bodyguard made phone calls to Harris, which authorities recorded, the statement said. Harris was supposed to pick up the guns after meeting the bodyguard in a shopping center parking lot in midtown Atlanta. Authorities arrested Harris there without incident, the Justice Department statement said. Court documents in the case show Harris was convicted on felony drug charges in Cobb County, Georgia, in 1998 and sentenced to seven years' probation. ""Harris has additional arrests and at least one probation violation for unlawfully possessing firearms,"" according to an affidavit. Harris' music is built around the drug culture and is known as ""trap musik,"" the name of Harris' second album. A ""trap"" is Southern slang for a drug house. Harris will be held in federal custody over the weekend and will appear Monday before a magistrate judge, the Justice Department statement said. Harris soon will appear in the movie ""American Gangster,"" starring Denzel Washington and Russell Crowe. The film is set to open November 2.  E-mail to a friend .

"In the mid-19th Century, two devastating floods of the Yellow River, and the famine that followed, ravaged northeastern China. Outlaw bands, known as nien, attracted young men in unprecedented numbers, aggregating into militias that wrought chaos on the troops and infrastructure of the ruling Qing. Although this Nien Rebellion and the larger Taiping rebellion in the South were eventually crushed, they devastated the Chinese economy and contributed to the ending of the Qing dynasty. According to political scientists Valerie Hudson and Andrea den Boer, widespread female infanticide during the famine meant that as many as one quarter of young men in the region were ""bare branches"" -- as the Chinese expression goes -- unlikely ever to bear fruit. The Nien rebellion, they argued, was propelled by these surplus young men who had so few other prospects. This story of the Nien Rebellion foreshadows one of the biggest issues that China will face in coming decades: the dramatic excess of young men. A long history of son preference, particularly among the Han majority, has led to female infanticide and the neglect of daughters in some parts of China. But in recent decades, the spread of cheap ultrasound (enabling sex-determination in early-mid pregnancy) and easy access to abortion courtesy of the government's one-child policy, has led to the widespread abortion of female fetuses. As a result, approximately 30 million more men than women will reach adulthood and enter China's mating market by 2020. The scale of this current sex-ratio bias dwarves that in the Nien rebellion, and the consequences could turn out to be more catastrophic. Young men with poor prospects of ever starting a family spell danger to themselves and to their societies. Over millions of years of evolution, large numbers of women and even larger numbers of men left no offspring at all. Yet everyone alive today descends from ancestors who managed to avoid that fate. Our male ancestors were the ones who strove most frantically for status and the respect of their peers, and who won the chance to mate. As a result, young men are hair-trigger sensitive to their circumstances, and when the number of men who will never find a mate rises, so does the intensity of the striving. Young men discount their futures and take ridiculous risks in order to improve their prospects. They also become more violent, rising more readily to perceived slights and insults, and starting more fights -- often over trivial issues. These are the triggers for most man-on-man assaults and homicides. Many factors contribute to the number of men who will never find a mate. Economic inequality, for one, leaves a great many poor young men unable to attract a wife. When a society allows powerful men to take several wives, too few women remain for many poor men to take even a single wife. But most dramatically of all, male-biased sex ratios consign the excess men to never having a family of their own. Under each of these scenarios, large numbers of young men competing for dominance elevate local rates of violence, homicide and lawlessness. Martin Daly and Margo Wilson's studies show that local income inequality can explain variation in homicide rates on a number of scales: from Chicago neighborhoods to American States and Canadian provinces. Throughout history, a surplus of young men often heralded violence. The American frontier earned its ""Wild West"" reputation for lawlessness because its towns overflowed with men, yet marriageable women were vanishingly rare. In The Chivalrous Society, historian Georges Duby argued that European expansionism, from the Crusades to colonialism, was fueled by a surplus of ambitious and aggressive young men with otherwise poor reproductive prospects. China is already feeling the effects of so many bare branches. The economist Lena Edlund estimates that every one percent increase in the sex ratio results in a six percent increase in the rates of violent and property crime. In addition, the parts of China with the most male-biased sex ratios are experiencing a variety of other maladies, all tied to the presence of too many young men. Gambling, alcohol and drug abuse, kidnapping and trafficking of women are rising steeply in China. The bare branch problem will be compounded as income inequality rises. China's Gini coefficient of income inequality has risen from less than 0.3, 25 years ago, to almost 0.5 today. On the Gini scale, 0 represents perfect equality while a score of 1 represents complete inequality. It would be difficult to overstate the urgent need for China to emulate South Korea in eliminating sex-biased abortion and neglect. But just as urgently, China needs creative large-scale solutions to the problems that unprecedented cohorts of bare branches will cause as they come of age over the next two decades. Those millions of disaffected young men will not only present a danger to themselves, but those living alongside them. And, as Hudson and den Boer have been arguing for some time, the bare branches will also make perfect fodder for political agitation, fundamentalism and possibly terrorism.

"(Mashable) -- Call it Cloudgate, Cloudpocalyse or whatever you'd like, but the extended collapse of Amazon Elastic Cloud Compute (EC2) is both a setback for cloud computing and an opportunity for us to figure out how to stop it from happening again. Amazon may be best-known for its online shopping site, but it also has a substantial cloud computing business. It provides a scalable, flexible and particularly efficient solution for companies to store and deliver massive amounts of content. Its model of only paying for what you consume was a radical innovation when it launched in 2006. In fact, Amazon Web Services has been so affordable and reliable that thousands of companies from Foursquare to Netflix utilize the company's cloud computing technology and servers to run their businesses. They put their faith in Amazon's cloud because there was no reason to think that it would falter. One of cloud computing's key tenants is reliability through redundancy of both servers and data centers. Then on Wednesday, Amazon's northern Virginia data center started experiencing problems that caused major latency and connectivity issues. The trouble was apparently due to excessive re-mirroring of its Elastic Block Storage (EBS) volumes -- this essentially created countless new backups of the EBS volumes that took up Amazon's storage capacity and triggered a cascading effect that caused downtime on hundreds (or more likely thousands) of websites for almost 24 hours. The collapse took its share of victims. Among the most prominent companies affected were Foursquare, Quora, Hootsuite, SCVNGR, Heroku, Reddit and Wildfire, though hundreds of other companies big and small were affected. Luckily, one of Amazon's most prominent customers, Netflix, didn't experience problems because it's built for the loss of an entire data center, while companies relying on Amazon's four other global data centers didn't experience too many issues. A learning moment . FathomDB founder Justin Santa Barbara has a detailed post on his blog about what may be the biggest problem to come out of this week's collapse: Amazon's cloud redundancies failed to stop a mass outage. Its Availability Zones are supposed to be able to fail independently without bringing the whole system down. Instead, there was a single point of failure that shouldn't have been there. This week's disaster in the cloud is a reminder to startups to build redundancy into their applications and their own systems, but as Santa Barbara points out, most startups don't have the time or resources to engineer for multiple cloud systems (each Amazon global region/data center has its own rules and features, making a simple ""switch"" to another center difficult). These companies trusted Amazon to keep them online, and Amazon failed to deliver. Catastrophic issues will always occur, but in the pre-cloud era, downtime only affected a single computer or website. Today, a catastrophic event takes down thousands of websites, causing millions or even billions of dollars in lost revenue and productivity. This incident is no reason for us to shun cloud computing, though. Its benefits (scalability, cost reduction, device independence, performance and more) far outweigh its cons. We do need to take a hard look at how we structure our cloud infrastructure though and find new ways to either prevent single points of failure or quickly move content off failing clouds faster, especially as the world's computing power is consolidated into fewer and fewer systems. Cloud computing is still in its infancy, and today's events make it clear that we still have a lot of work to do. It could be a whole lot worse next time if we aren't prepared.

Macau has 33 casinos -- with more on the way -- run by six casino operators: SJM Holdings (Stanley Ho), Wynn Macau, Sands China, Galaxy Entertainment Group, MGM China Holdings and Melco Crown Entertainment. According to a recent report in Bloomberg, gambling revenue in the Chinese city rose 18% to 297.1 billion patacas ($37.2 billion) in the first 10 months of this year, close to the $38 billion revenue the city raked in for the whole of 2012. That's six times more than the Las Vegas Strip earned. Leading the way is the Sands' Venetian property. With almost 540,000 square feet of gaming space, it has the largest casino floor in the world. The Las Vegas Sands group spent $2.4 billion to build this replica of the Las Vegas original. In Singapore, there are only two casinos -- Las Vegas Sands Corp.'s Marina Bay Sands and Genting Singapore PLC's Resorts World Sentosa. They generated about $5.85 billion in gambling revenue in 2012, putting Singapore behind Vegas for third in the world gaming revenue rankings. With 2,560 rooms and more than 10,000 staff, the $5.5 billion Marina Bay Sands has become Singapore's most famous landmark since opening in 2010 thanks to the boat-shaped rooftop that connects its three towers and dominates the skyline.

"The number of people enrolled in Obamacare stands at 7.5 million -- an increase of 400,000 since the Obama administration announced it surpassed its April 1 target, Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius told the Senate Finance Committee Thursday. The White House confirmed the increase in the number of people who have signed up on federal or state exchanges for coverage under the Affordable Care Act. President Barack Obama announced on April 1 that 7.1 million people had enrolled, surpassing the administration's goal of 7 million enrollments by that date. That was a surprising victory for the administration after a rocky rollout of the program, which has become a political hot potato for Democrats and a rallying cry for Republicans. The enrollment period began anemically in October with a faltering federal website. But signs of a pickup began in late January and continued into February and early March despite a fierce campaign by Republicans to demonize the law as unworkable.","Enrollment grew by 400,000 since administration announced it surpassed April 1 target .

"Virgin America ranked No. 1 in an annual airline rating report for the second consecutive year. Overall, the U.S. airline industry had its best-ever performance in 2013 on the Airline Quality Rating, released Monday. The statistical study of U.S. airlines, co-authored by aviation and marketing professors, has been conducted since 1991. The airline ratings are determined using a formula that considers multiple factors in consumer decision-making. On-time performance receives the most weight in the formula, followed by denied boardings, mishandled baggage and customer complaints. Data for all the criteria are drawn from the U.S. Department of Transportation's monthly Air Travel Consumer Report. The world's busiest airport is ... Virgin America, the top overall scorer, had a slight dip in its on-time performance in 2013 from 2012, dropping to 82.1% from 83.5%. The airline had the best record for baggage handling in 2013 among all the airlines rated. The U.S. airline industry saw an overall improvement in 2013 over 2012, according to the study, despite declines in two of four areas considered. ""I think generally speaking for the last several years we've been in a pretty good place from a performance standpoint,"" said study co-author Dean Headley, an associate professor of marketing at Wichita State University. The Airline Quality Rating is conducted jointly by Headley and Brent Bowen, a professor and dean at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University. ""As an industry we're in a good spot. People seem to be flying. Price isn't scaring them away, which seems to be what people look at most,"" Headley said. What doesn't always match up with performance is consumer perception of air travel, he said. The ratings don't assess airfares. On-time performance for U.S. airlines dropped in 2013 from 2012, with 78.4% of arrivals on time in 2013, compared with 81.8% in 2012. The number of mishandled bags jumped in 2013, from 3.07 per 1,000 passengers in 2012 to 3.21 in 2013. Hawaiian Airlines had the best on-time performance -- 93.3% -- among the 15 U.S. airlines rated, while American Eagle's 72.1% on-time arrivals put it at the bottom  of the pack. Industry performance improved in two of the four areas considered, with fewer denied boardings and customer complaints in 2013 than 2012. Southwest Airlines had the lowest consumer complaint rate of all airlines -- 0.34 per 100,000 passengers. Southwest routinely has the fewest customer complaints among U.S. airlines. Frontier had the highest rate of customer complaints, with 3.09 per 100,000 passengers. The industry is definitely in a period of readjustment, Headley said. United-Continental is still ironing out its merger, and the Southwest-AirTran and American-US Airways mergers still have a way to go. Things are bound to change for consumers, he said.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- In a new TV ad airing in Iowa, Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney stepped up his attacks on rival Mike Huckabee, this time accusing the former Arkansas governor of being soft on crime. But some of the claims Romney makes in the ad about his own crime-fighting record have raised questions. With the crucial Iowa caucuses a little more than two weeks away, the Romney ad, titled ""Choice: Judgment,"" attempts to contrast his record as Massachusetts governor with Huckabee's in Arkansas. With pictures of the two candidates on the screen, the ad's announcer says that ""Romney got tough on drugs like meth"" and that ""he never pardoned a single criminal.""  Watch Romney's ad attacking Huckabee » . The announcer goes on to say Huckabee ""granted 1,033 pardons and commutations, including 12 convicted murderers. Huckabee granted more clemencies than the previous three governors combined. Even reduced penalties for manufacturing methamphetamine."" The announcer closes with ""on crime the difference is judgment."" Speaking to reporters Monday in Los Angeles, California, Huckabee disputed the ad, pointing to his record of carrying out the death penalty while governor as evidence that he was tough on crime. Massachusetts doesn't have the death penalty. ""The difference between us is that I did something he never had to do. I carried out the death penalty 16 times, more than any other governor in my state's history,"" Huckabee said. The statistics cited in Romney's ad come from a recent Associated Press examination of Huckabee's record of commutations and pardons. Huckabee received more commutation and pardon requests than Romney did and rejected 78 percent of them, according to The Washington Post. One commutation request Huckabee rejected as governor was that of convicted rapist Wayne DuMond. But Huckabee supported DuMond's early release, and the convict raped and murdered a woman in Missouri after his 1999 parole. The mother of DuMond's victim has vowed to campaign against Huckabee's candidacy. Romney's claim he ""got tough"" on methamphetamine dealers is questionable since a proposal to stiffen sentences never passed the Massachusetts Legislature. The former Arkansas governor also challenged Romney's assertion that Huckabee had ""reduced"" the punishment for manufacturing meth. ""With Huckabee way ahead among evangelical voters, Romney is doing his best to change the subject to crime and, in an earlier ad, illegal immigration,"" said Howard Kurtz, The Washington Post's media critic and host of CNN's ""Reliable Sources."" ""Huckabee may have a hard time fighting back. He's got little money for TV, while Romney is spending millions."" The two candidates have been engaged in almost daily skirmishes over their records since Huckabee emerged as the front-runner in Iowa a few weeks ago, a position Romney had held. The Iowa caucuses will be held January 3. Before the disagreement over crime, the two exchanged barbs over foreign policy. In the current issue of Foreign Affairs magazine, Huckabee says, ""American foreign policy needs to change its tone and attitude, open up, and reach out. The Bush administration's arrogant bunker mentality has been counterproductive at home and abroad."" That stance prompted Romney, on NBC's ""Meet the Press"" on Sunday, to call on Huckabee to apologize to President Bush for his remarks. ""I said, 'Well, did this come from Barack Obama or from Hillary Clinton? Did it come from John Edwards?' No, it was Gov. Huckabee,"" Romney told host Tim Russert. ""The truth of the matter is this president has kept us safe these last six years and that has not been easy to do."" Huckabee said he didn't have anything for which to apologize. ""I didn't say the president was arrogant,"" Huckabee told CNN on Sunday. ""One of my opponents has mistakenly, maybe purposefully, misstated my position on that. I've said the policies have been arrogant."" E-mail to a friend .","Mitt Romney ad says Mike Huckabee was soft on crime as Arkansas governor .

"U.S. President Barack Obama voiced his support for Ukraine's newly elected president and called for the international community to ""stand solidly behind"" him Wednesday, on a visit to Europe dominated by the crisis in Ukraine. Obama's meeting in Warsaw, Poland, with Ukrainian President-elect Petro Poroshenko can be seen as a sign of U.S. support for the government in Kiev as it battles to quell a pro-Russian separatist uprising in Ukraine's East. Ukrainian authorities claimed Wednesday to have inflicted heavy losses on militant forces in the Donetsk region, at the same time as acknowledging that separatists have now seized two military bases in Luhansk. A separatist leader gave conflicting casualty figures. In remarks at a ceremony to mark the 25th anniversary of Poland's return to democracy, Obama also voiced his backing for Ukraine, and said the United States would stand up for freedom across the region. Poland and former Soviet states ""will never stand alone,"" Obama said. ""These are not just words. They are unbreakable commitments backed by the strongest alliance in the world and by the armed forces of the United States of America -- the most powerful military in history."" Conflicting accounts in heightened eastern Ukraine fighting . He also vowed to stand with Ukraine, which is not a member of NATO, in the face of Russian ""aggression,"" including its annexation of Ukraine's Crimea region in March. ""Ukraine must be free to choose its own future, for itself and by itself,"" Obama said. ""We will not accept Russia's occupation of Crimea or its violation of Ukraine's sovereignty. Our free nations will stand united so that further Russian provocations will only mean more isolation and costs for Russia."" Obama, who spoke after Polish President Bronislaw Komorowski at the solemn ceremony in the heart of Warsaw, also paid tribute to the Poles whose struggle for democracy lit a spark for revolutionary change. The 1989 election commemorated Wednesday ""was the beginning of the end of communism -- in this country and across Europe,"" he said. 'Deeply impressed' Addressing reporters earlier alongside Poroshenko, Obama said he was ""deeply impressed"" by the newly elected leader's vision of what is required to help Ukraine grow. ""The challenge now for the international community is to make sure that we are supportive of Petro's efforts, and the United States has already stepped up in a number of ways,"" he said. Obama said the pair had discussed additional steps the United States can take to help Ukraine through its transition process, including helping to train Ukrainian law enforcement officers and providing more nonlethal aid to its military. Deadly attack on pro-Russian separatists . He also spoke of the need for Ukraine to undertake economic reforms, including steps to reduce its dependence on natural gas supplies from Russia, currently used by Moscow as a means of leverage. Poroshenko, a business magnate seen as pro-European, is due to be sworn in Saturday. He thanked the United States for its support and said the Ukrainian people had shown their solidarity in rejecting Russia's annexation of Crimea. G7 diplomacy . The U.S. President then flew to Brussels, Belgium -- the second stop of his three-nation tour -- for a meeting of the G7 group of industrialized nations. Obama led the international effort to suspend Russia's participation in the world group of economic powers. That suspension resulted in the relocation of this year's planned G8 summit from Sochi, Russia, to Brussels, as the leaders of the G7 nations decided to meet without Russia. Obama suggested Tuesday that Russian President Vladimir Putin could regain the trust ""shattered"" by Russia's incursion into Ukraine, but only if Moscow plays by the rules and stops destabilizing Ukraine. Putin ""has a choice to make"" on Ukraine, Obama said, calling on the Russian President to continue to pull back troops from the border with Ukraine, persuade pro-Russian separatists to stand down and back Ukraine's recent presidential election. Obama and Putin are likely to cross paths while both are in France at the end of the week for events to mark the 70th anniversary of the D-Day landings, but no formal talks have been announced. Putin told French television station TF1 that he will not ""evade"" Poroshenko or anyone else. ""There will be other guests, and I'm not going to avoid any of them. I will talk with all of them,"" he said, according to the Kremlin's translation. However, German Chancellor Angela Merkel will meet Putin on the sidelines of the D-Day events Friday for discussions on Ukraine, the German government said. British Prime Minister David Cameron will meet the Russian leader on Thursday night, Downing Street said, adding that their talks will focus on steps Russia can take to de-escalate the crisis. Obama urges Putin to make choice over Ukraine . NATO defense ministers meet . Amid the heightened East-West tensions, NATO defense ministers met Wednesday in Brussels. NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said before meeting it was a timely opportunity ""to discuss our shared concerns over Russia's illegal aggression against Ukraine."" The alliance has come to the fore in recent weeks as former Soviet states which are now NATO members seek reassurance amid heightened concerns following Russia's annexation of Crimea. Obama on Tuesday announced that he would ask the U.S. Congress for a fund of up to $1 billion to allow for a ""European Reassurance Initiative"" to bolster the security of NATO allies. This would help the United States undertake increased training exercises, explore the prepositioning of military equipment, and build the capacity of Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine to partner with the United States and NATO. More U.S. Air Force and Army personnel will be rotated through allied countries in central and eastern Europe, Obama said. Recent moves by Russia to withdraw some of its forces from its border with Ukraine have the potential to ease tensions between Moscow and Washington. But administration officials caution a new detente is a long way off. Kiev and the West have said the separatists in Ukraine are coordinated and supplied by Russia, a claim that Moscow denies. Separatists seize Ukraine military bases . The volatile situation in eastern Ukraine appears to have taken a turn for the worse this week. The Ukrainian government claimed Wednesday that more than 300 pro-Russian militants have been killed and at least 500 wounded in ongoing Ukrainian military operations in the towns of Chervoniy Liman and Slovyansk. CNN could not immediately confirm the report. However, Vyacheslav Ponomarev, self-declared mayor of Slovyansk, told CNN that during Tuesday's attack by Ukrainian jets and helicopters, 10 separatist militants had died and 12 were injured. He added in the past three days, three civilians, including a woman, had died in the violence. The authorities also said that separatist fighters had taken over two military bases in Luhansk -- one run by the Border Guard and the other by the National Guard. The Ukrainian Border Guard base on the outskirts of Luhansk city has been evacuated and taken over by pro-Russia separatists, according to the Border Guard website. Ukrainian official: Five militants killed in attack on border guard base in Luhansk . The border guard detachment at the compound, which was badly damaged during 12 hours of clashes Monday, has been relocated to safe place, the Border Guard Service said. The Ukrainian National Guard said Wednesday it had lost control of its base after an attack by ""terrorists"" that began late Tuesday. Video appeared to show its detachment surrendering to separatists early Wednesday. The National Guard said its troops at the base had been relocated to ""a safe place."" Three of its men were injured, while six of the attackers were killed, it said. CNN cannot independently confirm the number of casualties. Civilians killed . The loss of the military bases follows a deadly attack Monday on a regional headquarters building in Luhansk that had been taken over by separatists calling themselves the People's Republic of Luhansk. Five women and three men, all of them civilians, were killed in the attack, which Kiev blamed on separatists. A munitions expert who accompanied a CNN crew to the scene, however, said the damage to the building was indicative of an airstrike. Ukraine's President-elect vows vengeance over helicopter attack . The Special Monitoring Mission of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe came to a similar conclusion. It's thought to be the first time that civilians have been killed or injured in an attack by the Ukrainian air force since pro-Russian groups began occupying buildings in the Luhansk and Donetsk regions more than two months ago. The U.N. children's agency, UNICEF, raised concern Tuesday over the plight of children caught up in the violence and urged all groups involved to protect children. Seven children, the youngest age 4, have sustained gunshot and shrapnel injuries in eastern Ukraine since May 9, the agency said, while others in Donetsk have been exposed to violence and terrifying events.","Vladimir Putin tells French TV he won't avoid any world leaders at D-Day ceremony .

"Don't read too much into the conversation. That was the message Wednesday from Estonian Foreign Minister Urmas Paet after a phone call between him and European Union foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton was leaked. In the recording, which was posted to YouTube and picked up by Russian media, Paet talks about his recent visit to Ukraine. He says a doctor named ""Olga"" told him opponents of Ukraine's ousted President may have been responsible for deadly sniper fire. President Viktor Yanukovych fled more than a week ago in the wake of protests in Kiev's Independence Square, where snipers from nearby rooftops killed scores of people. ""(Olga) can say that it is the same handwriting, the same type of bullets, and it's really disturbing that now the new coalition that -- they don't want to investigate what exactly happened. There is now stronger and stronger understanding that behind snipers, it was not Yanukovych, but it was somebody from the new coalition,"" Paet told Ashton. She replied: ""I think we do want to investigate ... I didn't pick that up. That's interesting. Gosh."" Paet's office released a statement Wednesday that confirmed the authenticity of the recording. It said the call took place on February 26. ""Foreign Minister Paet was giving an overview of what he had heard the previous day in Kiev and expressed concern over the situation on the ground. We reject the claim that Paet was giving an assessment of the opposition's involvement in the violence,"" the statement read. ""It is extremely regrettable that phone calls are being intercepted,"" said Paet in the same statement. ""The fact that this phone call has been leaked is not a coincidence."" Ashton's office declined to comment on the conversation, saying she does not discuss leaks. CNN could not immediately reach the Ukrainian government for comment, nor could it confirm the identity of ""Olga."" Russia's state-news agency RIA-Novosti said she was Olga Bogomolets, chief coordinator of medical aid at the main protest camp in Independence Square. CNN has previously talked to Bogomolets. She volunteered last month to treat protesters and accused forces of shooting to kill, saying she had treated 13 people she believed had been targeted by ""professional snipers."" ""They were shot directly to their hearts, their brain and to their neck,"" she said. ""They didn't give any chance to doctors, for us, to save lives."" The recording is the second such recent leak on Ukraine. Early last month, a leaked audio recording of a phone call allegedly caught a U.S. diplomat to Europe using profanity to express strong frustrations with inaction and indecision by the European Union in resolving the crisis. In the conversation, voices closely resembling those of Assistant Secretary for European Affairs Victoria Nuland and U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Geoffrey Pyatt discuss a plan to broker a deal between the Ukrainian government and the opposition. At one point the woman, who sounds like Nuland, can be heard saying ""f**k the EU."" The call could not be independently verified, and it was not clear when and where it was recorded.

"(CNN) -- Eden Foods has become the new front line in the contest over religion, health care and the workplace. Eden Foods is a closely held, for-profit corporation that objects to covering contraception on religious grounds. It lost its lawsuit last October, but the ruling was stayed pending the Supreme Court's decision on Hobby Lobby. Now, Eden Foods has a clear legal pathway to deny contraception coverage to its employees. Eden Foods, however, is in a very different business than Hobby Lobby. It sells organic products, a market that relies on educated, well-informed, urban consumers, a demographic that trends liberal. In response to the renewed attention on the Eden Foods case, defenders of the company, people who want to buy their products with a clean conscience, and the organic food stores who want to stay out of the crossfire, are all arguing that this is just a political dispute. They're wrong. This is not just another argument between the right and the left. Instead, the situation raises complicated and competing ethical claims on which we do have to take a position. That's not just my perspective; it's what Eden Foods implies as well. Michael Potter, the chairman and sole shareholder of Eden Foods, is an interesting fellow. He considers contraceptives to be ""lifestyle drugs,"" links birth-control pills to Jack Daniels, and calls President Barack Obama a dictator. He is a Catholic, but rather than focusing on a religious principle, he said the government shouldn't be able to make him provide birth control, although his lawyer has since clarified the matter. In response to a flood of customer complaints, the company released a statement: . ""Eden Foods is a principled food company. We were convinced that actions of the federal government were illegal, and so filed a formal objection. The recent Supreme Court decision confirms, at least in part, that we were correct. We realized in making our objection that it would give rise to grotesque mischaracterizations and fallacious arguments. We did not fully anticipate the degree of maliciousness and corruption that would visit us. Nevertheless, we believe we did what we should have."" Look at that language. ""Grotesque."" ""Fallacious."" ""Corruption."" Eden Foods casts itself as the righteous victim, unjustly accused, a rhetorical move particularly popular among the American Christian right wing. Even when the U.S. Supreme Court has handed them a victory, they portray themselves as victimized, although they did not respond, beyond their prepared statement, to a request I made for examples for mischaracterizations, untrue arguments, or corruption. In the meantime, some consumers are demanding their stores stop carrying Eden Foods, a complicated matter given the company's solid niche in the market. Organic food stores have tried to resolve their dilemma by dodging the question. Whole Foods, for example, responded to a Change.org petition on Eden Foods with a statement, saying, ""Our primary consideration is whether the product's ingredients meet our Quality Standards."" No one is questioning the quality, so Whole Foods will continue stocking the products. The Wedge, a major food co-op in Minneapolis, takes a slightly different path. They write, ""While we are disappointed by Eden Foods' stand on this issue, The Wedge has a long-standing tradition of not engaging in boycotts that are called for political reasons."" That word ""political"" rings out. Businesses are probably wise to stay out of politics much of the time, but they do stop buying products for ethical reasons. For example, when news broke about slave labor in the Asian shrimp industry, companies such as Costco and Wal-Mart acted to use their purchasing power to force change. For them, the ethics of slave labor, obviously, mandated action. I am not saying that the Eden Foods case is analogous to slave labor, but only that is reasonable to demand your grocery store respond to ethical complaints. Moreover, I base my conclusion that the issue at hand is ethical, and not political, on the statements coming from Eden Foods itself. The company isn't demanding an exemption because of politics, or because it supports one party over another, or even to save money. Instead, Eden officials claim that their position emerges out of their principles, their religious convictions, and that they are just trying to do the right thing. If we respect their claim, then we also have to respect the counter-argument. Access to birth control and the protection of women's rights likewise emerge from core principles. We are weighing competing ethical stances. There's a bigger context of competing claims here. Some religious people argue that their beliefs are under attack. Many women, and those concerned with gender equality, argue that the birth-control issue is just a first step toward broader conservative attempt to police female sexuality. In the meantime, five conservative Catholic men on the Supreme Court have made a ruling. Companies engaging in discriminatory practices and those who patronize them may be legally entitled to religious exemptions, but they are not exempt from the consequences of their actions. Consumers, especially in the organic food market, often choose what to buy based on ethical principles. The stores they patronize should, too.

"Former pharmaceutical executive Gigi Jordan testified that she knowingly gave a lethal concoction of drugs to her 8-year-old autistic son. Fighting back tears as she took the stand for the first time in her second-degree murder trial, Jordan said Wednesday that she knowingly gave herself and her son, Jude Mirra, enough drugs to kill them both. The prosecution, meanwhile, contends the killing was premeditated and Jordan expected to survive. When her Manhattan trial opened last month, Jordan showed no emotion as a prosecutor described to a jury a ""chilling and horrifying scenario"" in which Jordan allegedly forced the autistic boy to swallow a deadly drug cocktail. Bruises on the boy's nose, chin and chest indicated that she got on top of him and pressed the poisonous mix of painkillers and anti-inflammatories down his throat with a syringe, the prosecutor alleged. Looking gaunt and pale, Jordan denied that scenario on the stand Wednesday. ""Did you climb on top of Jude and grab his jaw and forcibly put liquid drugs down his throat,"" defense lawyer Allan Brenner asked. ""No,"" Jordan told the jury. ""Did you knowingly give Jude and yourself enough drugs to kill yourself and him?"" ""Yes,"" she responded, tears welling in her eyes. Asked about a history of suicide in her family, Jordan said an aunt killed herself when Jordan was 12 and her mother tried three times. Brenner and the defense team are trying to convince the jury that Jordan was a desperate mother ultimately driven to kill Jude by her two former husbands: One who had allegedly threatened to kill her, a crime that would have left the boy with his biological father, who she believed had sexually abused Jude. On the stand Wednesday, Jordan, a former nurse who made millions in a home heath care company, also suggested that the boy was physically and sexually abused not only by his biological father but by her first husband and his wife as well as the woman who took Jude to school. She testified that the boy was assaulted by ""a good number of people."" Jude was autistic and his vocabulary was limited, but one night he started screaming, according to Jordan: "" 'Dad bad. Dad bad. Dad bad.' Jude was never able to articulate the word and not clearly like he was screaming at the top of his lungs."" Jordan testified that she held her son as Jude gestured at his crotch. He pulled Jordan in front of him and whispered, ""Dad, butt. Finger, Finger.' He also kept saying dad, and it was clear he was talking about his dad,"" she told the jury. She testified that the boy had been forced to eat feces and do other ""gruesome and horrible"" things by his biological father. The boy's father has denied the allegations and has never been charged, CNN affiliate WCBS reported. In court, no one has disputed the unthinkable manner in which little Jude spent his final hours on February 5, 2010. Police found his cold body after they were dispatched to the luxury Peninsula Hotel in Manhattan. The call to police came after a relative of Jordan was unable to reach her. At an autopsy, four of the painkillers and anti-inflammatories used to kill Jude were recovered undigested from his stomach, prosecutors said. Orange juice and vodka were used to wash down the drugs. ""His fate was sealed,"" assistant district attorney Matt Bogdanos said in opening statements. ""He didn't die fast. One by one, his vital organs shut down. It didn't take minutes. It took hours to die."" While Jude lay dying, Bogdanos said, Jordan sent an email to a financial adviser instructing him to transfer the $125,000 trust she set up for her son to her personal account. Brenner said Jordan, believing she was ultimately protecting her son, brought the drugs to the hotel room with the intention of killing them both, but she survived the suicide attempt. The prosecution sought to show the jury that the killing was premeditated and that Jordan expected to survive. Bogdanos said Jordan ""went to the bank, she transferred $8 million from savings to checking. She checked in (at the hotel) without a reservation and paid cash."" The exact time of the boy's death could not be determined, but Jude's body temperature was 80 degrees, suggesting that when police arrived, he had been dead for 8 to 14 hours, Bogdanos said. Police found a variety of drugs, which the prosecutor enumerated for the jury: ""Xanax, 1,000 pills; Prozac, 200 pills; Ambien 400 pills; Celebrex, a pain reliever, 250 pills; Trexone, similar to morphine, 300 pills; and hydrocodone."" These were among the drugs found in the hotel room and part of the lethal mix that Jordan allegedly gave her son, according to Bogdanos. But Brenner has sought to show that Jordan acted out of love and desperation. She had been threatened by her first husband and former business partner, Brenner said. She had accused the man of raiding her bank accounts and defrauding her of millions in profits from their joint businesses. She filed a lawsuit against him in 2012, seeking damages for breach of contract and fraud. Defendant Gigi Jordan ""knew all the dirty deals,"" Brenner said. Her first husband ""knew that Jude was her soft spot."" Jordan ""believed he was going to kill her, leaving a sexual predator to exercise his paternal rights,"" Brenner told the jury. Her first husband filed a lawsuit in August 2013, claiming Jordan defamed him in interviews she gave the media in an effort to advance her defense. Jordan believed that if she died, Jude's biological father, a yoga instructor, would have gained custody, according to Brenner. Brenner said Jordan told a therapist and local authorities about the alleged abuse but no action was taken. Jordan then decided to seek the help of a nationally renowned expert on child exploitation in Cheyenne, Wyoming. After being interviewed by him for 30 minutes, Brenner said, Jordan was accused of being unfit and delusional, taken to a medical facility and separated from her son for several months before being reunited with the boy. Jordan faces 15 years to life in prison if convicted.","Gigi Jordan testifies that she gave her son a lethal drug cocktail .

"(CNN) -- It was a woman's raw, bleeding hands that led Jock Brandis to make a promise. Jock Brandis shows some African men how to use a device that shells nuts, helping make more money for the village. In 2002, Brandis was helping a friend repair a water treatment system in a Mali, Africa, village. There, he encountered a woman whose hands were bleeding from shelling peanuts to support her family -- and this was not uncommon. In Africa alone, women spend 4 billion hours a year shelling peanuts by hand, according to the Peanut Collaborative Research Support Program. ""A sun-dried peanut is like a little rock. It's that hard,"" says Brandis. ""Cracking the shells takes hours of effort for the village women who traditionally do the chore, and it often leaves their hands bloody."" Brandis promised the women in the village he would return in a year with a machine to speed the shelling. That turned out to be easier said than done. ""When I went back to America, it didn't exist,"" recalls Brandis. So he started asking around. ""I didn't know much about peanuts, so I guess I did what any Canadian with a question about peanuts would do. I wrote Jimmy Carter,"" Brandis said. Through former President Jimmy Carter's library, Brandis tracked down an expert who suggested he look at a sketch from a Bulgarian scientist. Brandis attempted to replicate the sketch, but it didn't work. Having tinkered and toiled with ""gizmos"" as a former gaffer in the film industry, Brandis set out to make a peanut sheller himself. After fiddling, cranking and grinding his way through a number of prototypes in his Wilmington, North Carolina, studio, Brandis developed a simple machine that could shell nuts up to 50 times faster than by hand. Designed with a simple, durable hand crank, the ""universal nut sheller"" could be built with $28 worth of materials. To give this ""gift to the world,"" Brandis joined forces with a group of former Peace Corps volunteers and co-founded the Full Belly Project in 2003, a nonprofit organization dedicated to designing and distributing technologies like the universal nut sheller. Brandis travels with others to developing countries to show local shellers how to use and make the machines themselves.  Watch Brandis show one of the most efficient peanut shellers » . ""It makes their work less tedious and increases productivity up to 50 times,"" says Brandis. ""One machine will work for an entire village, so when we're talking about 100 machines, we're not talking about 100 families -- we're talking about 100 villages."" Not only does Brandis refuse to patent the device, but designs for the shelling machine also are available online for anyone to download, assemble, duplicate or improve upon, which Brandis encourages. ""One of the great things that happened is that when this machine went out, we started getting word back from all over the world saying, 'Oh, we don't use it for peanuts. We use it for shea, for jatropha, for coffee,' "" he says. ""It's now become much bigger than just being a peanut sheller.""  Watch Brandis talk about adapting his invention to shell other nuts » . The Full Belly Project works on four continents in 17 countries. Hundreds of machines are in use or being produced locally at minimal cost in the Philippines, Uganda and Guatemala, resulting in health benefits and increased family incomes, according to the Full Belly Project. ""I get up in the morning and there's an e-mail from a total stranger and a picture,"" says Brandis. ""It's a happy person standing beside their machine with a big grin. That's the [moment] I live for."" E-mail to a friend .","After trip to Mali, Jock Brandis seeks machine to shell peanuts .

"(CNN) -- On this date, July 30, nearly a half-century ago, the United States achieved a major victory. Medicare, the nation's first national health insurance program, was born. As part of President Lyndon Johnson's Great Society, Medicare extended health coverage to seniors who inevitably needed care. It's been a well-accepted success and highlights the benefits of improving health care access. But despite Monday's cautiously optimistic report on Medicare's solvency, a sustainable and comprehensive health care system requires covering everybody. Expanding Medicare for all is the fairest, most effective and straightforward way to ensure universal coverage in America. With Medicare, seniors have greater access to care. Yet most people deal with an overly complex system that fails to provide the same benefits our seniors receive. Even after the passage of Obamacare, unacceptable burdens remain. Consider the health coverage of women. Today women consume the most health care services. They have greater annual health care expenses than men and pay a greater proportion of their health care costs out-of-pocket. The Kaiser Family Foundation reports that about one in five women is still uninsured. More than half these women struggle with their medical bills. The story is even worse for low-income women, who are more likely to forgo treatment because of its cost. About 4 million low-income women can cover only themselves and are unable to receive financial support to purchase insurance for their families. Women make up two-thirds of the low wage workforce -- and only 23% of low-wage jobs provide employer-sponsored health insurance. Obamacare was supposed to help. But 3 million low-income and minority women live in states that have yet to expand Medicaid, leaving them unable to obtain Obamacare's coverage for our most vulnerable families, which was promised in the law. To be sure, Obamacare does offer greater protections and support for working women to obtain basic insurance. But with the fluctuating and often excessive premiums, deductibles and co-pays, these bills remain onerous. Accesses to in-network physicians remain restricted. Women, like so many working Americans, are getting nickel-and-dimed, unable to afford and access comprehensive medical coverage. Our health plans continue to be held hostage by private carriers who must spend on hefty overhead and marketing to guarantee ever-growing profits for their shareholders. To make matters worse, the courts have further restricted the availability of comprehensive coverage. With the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling in Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores Inc., which gave companies the ability to withhold benefits based on religious grounds, women may lose coverage for basic birth control and reproductive health needs. It's unconscionable that in the richest nation on Earth, health disparities linger because ordinary people can't obtain good care. Working families continue to wrestle with pocketbook-busting medical expenses and tussle with companies that get in between them and their physician. It doesn't have to be this way. We could provide hassle-free health care to both men and women just as we do for everyone over 65. By opening Medicare to everyone, we could secure universal coverage and run a more efficient and just system. Medicare is far from perfect, but the flexible program stands strong. By expanding it, we can better pay for quality care and bargain with hospitals, drug companies and device firms on behalf of everyday people. All Americans could obtain quality care from any physician. And similar to how they do it in most wealthy nations, the government will reimburse the provider or company for that care. Businesses could focus on staying competitive rather than haggling with insurance companies over costly health plans for their workers. We can fund the plan by preserving how we pay for health care and asking our very well-off to contribute a little more. The government would levy a small increase in payroll taxes on employers -- who would no longer have to pay health plan premiums -- and also issue a small tax on stock and bond transactions. A single-payer health care system built off Medicare would guarantee universal coverage and far better health outcomes. To that end, Michigan's U.S. Rep. John Conyers, a Democrat, has again introduced his Medicare-For-All proposal. U.S. Rep. Jim McDermott, D-Washington, and U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vermont, have introduced a similar version. Outside our nation's capital, Vermont is working to implement universal coverage for its residents next year, aiming to serve as a model for the rest of the nation. As Sanders said, ""The United States is the only major nation in the industrialized world that does not guarantee health care as a right to its people."" What America is doing on health care isn't working for either men or women. If we want to join the rest of the industrialized world, we must increase eligibility to the widely popular program, Medicare, which celebrates its 49th anniversary on Wednesday. The nation deserves a system that values wellness above profits, and progress over inertia and false starts.","Vijay Das: Nearly 50 years old, Medicare has been a success and has improved health care .

"At the outset of his term, the new president of Iran, Hassan Rouhani, will confront a thicket of national and international challenges. Rouhani's presidential term starts at a particularly challenging time; the Islamic Republic of Iran is facing an unprecedented level of regional and international isolation. One of the most crucial foreign policy objectives which will take precedence in Rouhani's agenda is the Syrian conflict, which has now entered its third year. The election result raises vital questions regarding whether Iran's foreign policy towards Assad's sect-based and police regime will be altered or whether Iranian-Syrian alliance will evolve into a new phase. Will the presidency of the centrist Rouhani influence Iran's diplomatic ties with Damascus and its unconditional support for Assad? Will Tehran change its political, military, intelligence and advisory assistance to Syria's state apparatuses, army, security forces, and Mukhabart? While there is a significant amount of high expectations and enthusiasm among some Western political leaders and scholars that the election of the centrist Rouhani might influence Iran's support of Assad, it is crucial to be realistic about Iran's centrist and moderate camp's ideology, the power of the presidential office, Iran's political structure, and Tehran's foreign policy objectives. First of all, it is necessary to note that the Iranian centrists and moderates' political spectrum analyze Syria from the realms of balance of power as well as from a religious and geopolitical paradigm rather than from a human rights one. Although Rouhani argues for constructive interactions with other countries and although he supports applying a softer political tone -- as opposed to the combative, controversial and provocative language that Mahmoud Ahmadinejad or other hardliners utilize -- when dealing with the international community and regional state actors in regards to Syria, Rouhani has not called for an overall sweeping shift in Iran's foreign policy. For instance, Rouhani has neither asked Assad to step down from power nor pressed to halt the Islamic Republic of Iran's military, intelligence, financial, and advisory support to Damascus. From the perspective of the centrists, including Rouhani, withdrawing support to Damascus equates to undermining Tehran's geopolitical leverage and balance of power in the region, which ultimately endangers their own power. This becomes particularly more significant to the Iranian leaders who argue that they are surrounded by what they perceive as existential and strategic enemies; the United States' military bases, for instance, are located throughout Iran's borders and in the Gulf Arab states (Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, etc). More fundamentally, because of the role the Supreme Leader plays in Iran's foreign policy objectives, it would be unrealistic to argue that Rouhani would alter Iran's current political status quo towards Assad's regime. Rouhani does not completely control the country's foreign relations with Syria; Iran's policy towards Damascus is closely guided by Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the high generals of Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps, and Etela'at -- Iran's intelligence. However, Rouhani does have the ability to set the tone in regional and international circles for the Supreme Leader. In addition, the Supreme Leader has been very clear about his political stance on Syria, stating that Assad's regime is targeted by Israeli and U.S.-backed groups, foreign conspirators and terrorists. Lastly, religiously and ideologically speaking, one of the major pillars of Iran's foreign policy has been that it has proclaimed itself as the safe-guarder of Islamic -- particularly Shiite -- values. The Alawite sect-based state of Syria serves as a crucial instrument for advancing, empowering, and achieving this ideological foreign policy objective. Iran under Rouhani's presidency is unlikely to change the current status quo, push for regime change in Syria, ask Assad to step aside as many Western and Arab Gulf states did, or halt any political, military, intelligence and advisory assistance to Assad's ruling Alawite and socialist Bath party, due to the belief that they will be ideologically and religiously weakening their own regional influence and foreign policy leverage. If the Alawites lose power, the next government would likely be constituted from the current oppositional groups and the Sunni majority in Syria, who comprise roughly 74% of the population. As in Egypt and Tunisia, where the Islamic Sunni parties were the ones who won the elections, in Damascus, the Sunni oppositional groups are more likely to win most of the parliamentary seats in the situation of a new government forming after Assad. This will be regarded as a considerable shift in regional and international balance of power against Iran and in favor of the Arab Gulf states, particularly Saudi Arabia. Considering the aforementioned factors: the president's limited control over directing foreign policy compared to the Supreme Leader's more powerful role, the centrist and moderate ideologies, as well as the geopolitical, and ideological elements surrounding the issue , it is more likely that Iran will continue implementing its current strategies towards Syria to preserve Iran's regional and international balance of power, its political and economic national interests, and the survival of the ruling clerics.

"When the rocket scientist Yvonne Brill died in March, The New York Times celebrated her as the maker of a ""mean beef stroganoff"" and ""the world's best mother."" When my 4-year-old daughter, Ellie, a wildly creative and interesting girl, finished a year of preschool last week, her teachers gave her an award for being the best dressed. A few years ago at my son's preschool camp award ceremony, I sat silently as well-meaning counselors called each child forward. Girls: best hair, best clothes, best friend, best helper and best artist. Boys: best runner, best climber, best builder and best thrower. My son won best soccer player. In general, girls received awards for their personalities and appearance and boys for their actions and physical attributes. It was similar at my daughter's ceremony, where the teacher told us that all the children were so excited to see what award they would receive; it had obviously been built up as a big deal. The gender disparity was subtle but present. A boy received best engineer. A girl got best friend. Another girl was the best helper, and another most compassionate. A boy received best break dancer. A girl was named most athletic, and the teacher told us how when all the class raced around the track this girl ""beat everyone! Even the boys!"" And then my daughter got her certificate, showing her in a funky orange sweater, tight pants, and holding a bowling ball. Her award -- best dressed. Many decades after the feminist movement of the 1960s, why are we still stuck in this gender-norming rut? More: CNN's 'Girl Rising' The truth is that my daughter may well be the best dressed in her class. She has a terrific sense of style. One day she put on a hand-me-down Disney princess outfit, looked in the mirror and said, ""OK Dad, I'm ready to dig for worms!"" Another day, she went to school in a pink dress, green rain boots and a viking helmet. I frequently come home to find her in a pirate costume. She's practical and became outraged when she discovered that her ""girl jeans"" turned out to have fake pockets. ""Daddy,"" she said, ""Where am I going to put my pine cones?"" If she's the best dressed, it's because of her creativity. Sometimes, I find the prospect of raising a girl to be terrifying. The forces of patriarchy conspire to render girls weak, subordinate and sexually objectified. When we respond to infants by gendering our speech, strong for boys and lilting for girls, we immediately start to shape their interactions with the world. More: Christiane Amanpour's open letter to girls of the world . I would once have said nothing was worse than the conspicuous consumption mantras of Barbie or the female-subjugation messaging of Disney, but then I encountered the hyper-sexualized elementary-school girls called Bratz. And then there's underwear. Boys mostly get superheroes and girls get hearts and flowers, but at least Dora is an explorer.  All too soon Ellie will encounter the world of Justin Bieber nightgowns and Victoria's Secret underwear for tweens. The teenage years with the new dangers of sex, alcohol, eating disorders and more will arrive before we know it. I can't save her from all of this, and anyway we buy into purity culture (the notion that only a father's constant surveillance can save our daughters) at our peril and the peril of our daughters. Our daughters need to be strong, not closeted and coddled. We have to arm them with the tools to question, resist and change our patriarchal culture. Ellie's teacher is the kind of smart and strong young woman I want as a role model for my daughter (she's also a really snappy dresser), and I know she was only trying to make the transition moment special for each student. She absolutely intended to celebrate the way Ellie expresses her creativity through clothes. But gender stereotypes are, by their very nature, pernicious. They creep into our minds, shaping our perceptions of the world on a subconscious level, tricking us into betraying our values. Our culture constantly projects the message that only appearances matter, and this message is aimed squarely at our children. We can fight this only by working against the grain, resisting gendered language and emphasizing the internal over the external. If my daughter's creativity shines through in her choice of clothing, then celebrate both that creativity and the critical thinking that lies at the heart of all creative acts with a most creative award. Or we could just let Ellie tell us what she wants us to celebrate. When she picked up her award, she beamed at the picture of herself holding the bowling ball so proudly. ""Daddy!"" she said, ""I won best bowler!""","David Perry: At preschool, daughter named best dressed; prizes ran along gender lines .

"Dick's Sporting Goods, one of the largest sporting goods retailers in the world, says it has removed all guns from its store nearest to Newtown, Connecticut, and is suspending the sale of certain kinds of semi-automatic rifles from its chains nationwide. The move was made out of respect for the victims and families of last week's Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting ""during this time of national mourning,"" the store said in a statement Tuesday morning. ""We continue to extend our deepest sympathies to those affected by this terrible tragedy,"" the statement said. It was unclear how long the store will keep the suspension in place for the guns, known as 'modern sporting rifles.' It's also not known whether this is the first time the store has taken such a step after a shooting that made national headlines. After Newtown, the NRA goes silent . A search of Dick's Sporting Goods website early Tuesday morning showed a blank page for ""modern sporting rifles."" The move comes after reports that investigators were trying to determine whether the gunman in the Newtown shooting, Adam Lanza, tried to buy a gun from a Dick's Sporting Goods store in the city of Danbury, about 12 miles away.

"Lawrence Russell Brewer was executed in Texas Wednesday evening for his involvement in the infamous dragging death of a black man 13 years ago. Brewer, 44, was one of three men convicted for involvement in the murder of James Byrd. He was executed by lethal injection at 6:21 p.m. local time (7:21 p.m. ET) Wednesday , according to the Texas Department of Criminal Justice. Brewer ate a huge final meal, according to Texas Department of Criminal Justice spokesman Jason Clark.   It consisted of chicken fried steaks, a triple-meat bacon cheeseburger, a cheese omelet, a bowl of fried okra, barbeque, fajitas, pizza, and a slab of peanut butter fudge with crushed peanuts. After the meal, Brewer was given time to make phone calls to family and friends. Brewer and two other white men kidnapped the 49-year-old black man on the night of June 7, 1998. They chained him by the ankles to the back of a pickup truck and dragged him for 3 ½ miles down a country road near Jasper, Texas. Byrd died when he was decapitated after he hit a culvert. Prosecutors said the crime, which they described it as one of the most vicious hate crimes in U.S. history, was intended to promote Brewer's fledgling white supremacist organization. During his 1999 trial, they called Brewer a racist psychopath. Brewer was a former ""Exalted Cyclops"" of a racist prison gang affiliated with the Ku Klux Klan. He spent most of his adult life in prison for burglary, cocaine possession and parole violations. During the trial, Brewer took the witness stand and contended that he was a bystander, not a killer. He tearfully admitted being present when Byrd was dragged to his death but, he said, ""I didn't mean to cause his death. I had no intentions of killing anybody."" Brewer said accomplice John William King initiated the killing by fighting with Byrd. He also said the third defendant, Shawn Berry, slashed Byrd's throat and then chained him to Berry's pickup. Brewer admitted kicking Byrd and spraying Byrd's face with black paint. But he said it was a reflex action taken to try to break up the fight between Byrd and King. When Brewer was sentenced to death in 1999, Jasper County District Attorney Guy James Gray said that, while he did not personally favor the death penalty, it was necessary in Brewer's case. ""This is a situation where if you don't give the death penalty to this man, he will kill again,"" said Gray. To impose the death penalty, the jurors in Brewer's trial had to answer three questions under Texas law: . -- Would Brewer be a threat to society in the future; . -- Did Brewer mean to kill Byrd; . -- And, were there mitigating circumstances that would warrant sparing Brewer's life? To sentence Brewer to death, the jurors voted unanimously on each question -- answering the first two yes and the last no. The execution was the 11th this year in Texas, the most active death-penalty state. King also was sentenced to death and is awaiting the outcome of an appeal. The third man, Berry, was sentenced to life in prison. In 2009, President Barack Obama signed into law expanded hate crime legislation that was named after Byrd and Mathew Shepard, a gay Wyoming man who died after being kidnapped and severely beaten in October 1998.","Lawrence Brewer executed in Texas at 7:21 p.m. ET .

"(CNN) -- The Hillsborough County, Florida, sheriff on Wednesday offered a personal apology to a disabled man who was dumped onto the floor from his wheelchair while in deputies' custody. Brian Sterner has been using a wheelchair since a 1994 wrestling accident. ""I am personally embarrassed and shocked by the horrific treatment Mr. Sterner received,"" Sheriff David Gee says in a statement on the department's Web site. A video now making the rounds on television networks and various Web sites shows a deputy tipping Brian Sterner, 32, out of a wheelchair at the county's booking center in Tampa on January 29. ""I cannot and will not even try to offer an explanation for what is seen on the video, other than to say, that once it was brought to my attention, I immediately initiated an internal investigation,"" Gee said. Sterner had been picked up by sheriff's deputies on a warrant for a charge of fleeing and attempting to elude police in an incident in October of last year, his attorney said. ""This deputy ... she looked at me, she didn't believe that I was a quadriplegic, I guess, and she walked behind me with those handles on the back of that hospital-grade wheelchair and she just dumped it straight forward,"" Sterner told Tampa television station WTSP.  Watch the incident on tape » . As Sterner lay crumpled on the floor, two female deputies frisked him. ""I told them how to pick me up and put me back in the chair, but without sensation -- I don't feel anything from my chest down -- so I didn't know they were broken then, my ribs,"" he added. John Trevena, Sterner's attorney, said the sheriff denied that his client's ribs were broken, saying that X-rays showed no fractures. Sterner spent five days in the jail's infirmary before being released on $2,000 bond, Trevena said. The deputy responsible for dumping Sterner from the chair has been suspended without pay, Gee said in his statement. The three supervisors who were on duty during the incident have also been suspended, but with pay, the sheriff's public information office told CNN. ""The incident involving Mr. Sterner was not caused by a lack of training or procedure,"" the sheriff's statement said. ""It represents aberrant behavior that is totally out of context with policies, practices and standards of the Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office. ""Last year over 72,000 inmates were processed through central booking, more than 230 of them came to jail in wheelchairs,"" he added. Gee said he offered his personal apology to Sterner for ""the treatment he received."" ""I want to assure him, and the public at large, that this incident is not indicative of the behavior of the over 3,500 men and women of the Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office who perform their duties with pride and professionalism on a daily basis,"" he said. Trevena said his client would likely not file a lawsuit in the matter, because Gee has pledged to ""make it right.""  Watch a legal analyst discuss the incident » . ""He was very apologetic, very contrite,"" the attorney told CNN in a phone interview Wednesday, referring to a conversation he had with the sheriff Tuesday. ""I don't believe a lawsuit is going to be necessary. He said he will do anything and everything to make it right."" Trevena said Gee is handing the matter over to the state's attorney to review for possible criminal charges. The lawyer said the arrest was a complete surprise to Sterner, who had received only a ticket after police stopped him in his hand-pedal-controlled car for failing to yield in October. At the time, the attorney said, Sterner also submitted to a blood test and no illegal substances were found in his blood. Sterner became disabled in a wrestling accident when he was 18, Trevena said. Sterner took his story to WTSP a few days after he was released from custody, his attorney said, and the station obtained the booking video from the sheriff's department.

"After hours of debate on the  massive government spending package, the Senate adjourned until Saturday, pushing a fight that dominated Congress for days into the weekend. The Senate is expected to vote Monday on the $1.1 trillion package, which has already passed the House, Sens. Mitch McConnell and Barbara Mikulski said late Friday. Members from both parties in the Senate are trying to make last-minute changes to the bill. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid made a procedural move Friday that would set up a vote on final passage in the Senate no later than Monday. In a surprise development, the Senate recessed until Saturday, when it is expected to approve a five-day continuing resolution to keep the government operating until the bill is completed. Reid tried to get unanimous consent for an adjournment until Monday when there would be enough votes to end the filibuster, but Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, objected because Reid would not guarantee a vote on an amendment dealing with immigration funding. Reid then announced to an almost empty chamber that the Senate will be in session beginning at noon Saturday. It's unclear whether both sides will speed things up enough Saturday for a vote on the spending package. Two votes are expected Monday: a procedural vote to overcome the filibuster and end debate on the bill, and a second one on the final passage. The Senate was facing a Saturday deadline to approve the spending bill and avert a government shutdown, but that was pushed back. Earlier Friday, the House  approved a five-day stopgap bill to make sure the government was continually funded. The chamber has been sifting through many of the same arguments that tied up the House on Thursday, when disagreements over immigration and provisions related to Wall Street and campaign finance nearly derailed the bill. Senate lawmakers wanted votes on amendments that would address those issues. 'Using every tool available' Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Massachusetts, and Sen. David Vitter, R-Louisiana, filed an amendment that would strip a provision that softens financial regulations on banks from the spending bill. ""Congress should not put taxpayers on the hook for another bailout, and this giveaway that was drafted by Citigroup lobbyists has no place in a critical government funding bill,"" Warren said. Meanwhile, Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, a chief critic of President Barack Obama's recent executive action on immigration, also said he wanted a vote to block those actions. ""I think it is critical that the Senate have the opportunity to have a clear up or down vote on funding President Obama's illegal executive amnesty,"" he told reporters.  ""I am using every tool available to help bring about that vote."" But by making the procedural move, Reid prevented those amendments from being considered. Amendment votes could have been risky because if either measure passed, the spending bill would have to go back to the House to be voted on again. While the House is technically in session, most members have left Washington until the new Congress convenes in early January. A day after his administration scrambled to save the bill after it appeared it might be defeated in the House, the President said he was pulling for it in the Senate. ""I'm glad it passed the House and am hopeful that it will pass the Senate,"" he said.","Lawmakers from both parties seeking amendments .

"(CNN) -- Calvino Inman had just stepped out of the shower one evening in May when a glimpse of his reflection in the mirror caused him to panic. ""I looked up and saw myself, and I thought I was going to die,"" says the 15-year-old from Rockwood, Tennessee. His eyes were streaming tears of blood. Doctors are still searching for a medical reason for Calvino Inman's tears of blood. Inman's mother, Tammy Mynatt, says she immediately rushed him to the emergency room, but by the time they arrived, the bleeding had stopped. Doctors couldn't see what the family was trying to explain. They returned home completely perplexed. When the bloody tears returned a few days later while Inman was on a camping trip, he was rushed back to the hospital. Mynatt hoped that once doctors finally witnessed the phenomenon, there would be answers. But that wasn't the case. ""The people at the hospital said they had never seen anything like it,"" Mynatt recalls. She says her son underwent an MRI, a CT scan and an ultrasound, but none of the tests had abnormal results. ""'We don't know how to stop it,'"" Mynatt remembers being told by doctors. ""It just has to run its course."" Dr. Barrett G. Haik, director of the University of Tennessee's Hamilton Eye Institute, says there is an answer, sort of. He says ""crying blood,"" a condition called haemolacria, is common in people who have experienced extreme trauma or who have recently had a serious head injury. But a case such as Inman's is still a medical mystery. ""What's really rare is to have a child like this,"" Haik says. ""Only once every several years do you see someone with no obvious cause.""  Watch more on the teen who cried blood » . Haik and a team of researchers published a 2004 study in the Journal of the American Society of Ophthalmic Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery looking specifically at children who developed unexplained, spontaneous episodes of bloody tears between February 1992 and January 2003. Only four cases were recorded. Because of the rarity of the condition, experts anticipate Inman will have multiple tests from a variety of specialists, including hematologists (blood specialists), ophthalmologists (eye specialists) and otolaryngologists (ear, nose and throat specialists). Dr. James C. Flemming, also an ophthalmologist at the Hamilton Eye Institute, has been in touch with Mynatt and her son. He is reviewing Inman's medical records for possible treatment. Flemming says complications to look for include blood clots, a growth or tumor near the eye, or even a simple infection. He also says the culprit could be something so tiny that none of the standard tests would pick it up. ""It's a very hard thing to estimate,"" Flemming says. ""You may have to watch expectedly for other symptoms to show up."" Inman's analysis would also include a psychological evaluation to rule out the possibility that the bloody tears were faked. ""When you can't find an origin, you can't eliminate any of the possibilities"" Haik explains. He says there have been cases where children seeking attention have found creative ways to simulate haemolacriatic symptoms. Still, Mynatt and her son are relieved to at least have more guidance. In an interview with CNN affiliate WATE, Mynatt was near tears herself explaining her frustration: ""I just truly want somebody to say they've seen this and they can help us."" And that's at least one reassurance Flemming and his team of experts at the Hamilton Eye Institute can offer. ""We get more positive talk now than negative. It really feels like there's hope,"" Mynatt says, relieved. But still, the possibility remains that after endless tests, the underlying cause may never be found. In all four cases Haik examined previously, the bleeding stopped on its own. ""As physicians, that's disconcerting, because we like to have the answers,"" Haik admits. Moreover, he says he knows from previous experience that the toll of not knowing is much worse for patients. ""I could always see the fear in their faces because no matter what we studied, we couldn't find an answer.""","Tennessee teen started crying blood tears in May .

"(CNN)You may have heard of the Internet of Things -- the idea that eventually all physical objects could communicate data over the internet to other connected devices. Already many devices in cities -- from automobiles to thermostats -- communicate information to operators, manufacturers and consumers via the internet about their status. But in rural Wales, a region not noted for its connectivity, researchers have begun a study into the Internet of Sheep, attaching wireless devices to livestock to gather information. ""Most of the work on the Internet of Things has taken place in cities,"" Computer scientist Professor Gordon Blair of Lancaster University told CNN. ""But I think we're quite unique in taking the concept out into a more rural environment. ""This gives it a very different flavor."" While it has been widely reported that flocks of sheep in the project could transmit WiFi and improve internet coverage in rural areas, Professor Blair said this is not the aim of the research. So far, the study is all about gleaning data from the flock, not transmitting WiFi signals from the animals. He doubts whether sheep could ever become roving wireless internet transmitters. ""I would worry about sheep flocking behavior -- I don't think sheep are the right animals to do this. ""Other researchers in north Norway have looked at reindeer. Perhaps reindeer are more individualistic in their behavior but I'm not an expert on animal behavior,"" he said. For animals to be effective WiFi nodes, he said, they need to be social but spread out at the same time; a tough ask of nature. He said the beauty of sheep was that they flock together -- easily transmitting data until the flock come close to an internet receiving station which would take up the data and transmit it to researchers at Lancaster University. ""The signal goes from sheep to sheep to sheep - it's a bit like gossip, if you like."" Sheep jokes apart, the aim of the study is serious. ""We are looking deliberately at breadth, because there may be surprises; the natural environment is all about dependencies and things that can affect other things,"" Blair said. ""The Internet of Sheep is about capturing sheep movements which could tell us a lot."" Everything from flooding to drought to agricultural pollution could be monitored with a series of riverside and sheep-bound sensors. ""There's quite a big risk with the natural environment and sheep -- there are defecation and water quality issues. ""If the pathogens coming through sheep wash into rivers and then into estuaries and water supplies -- that can be very dangerous."" The study has been backed by a £171,495 ($265,000) prize from the UK's Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council to look at ways of bringing the Internet of Things to the countryside. The project is currently centered in Conwy, North Wales, where sheep farmer Gareth Wyn Jones -- star of the BBC series The Hill Farm -- is cooperating with the project. ""Under EU regulations we already have to electronically chip sheep so the technology is already there in one respect,"" he told the BBC.

"(CNN) -- Despite persistent and understandable questions about the cost of college in America today, the value of a college education is clear. But that value is not spread as equitably as it should be across the nation. College graduates earn considerably more over the course of their careers than do people with just a high school education, and they are much less likely to be unemployed. A study by the New York Federal Reserve found the rate of return on a college degree to be approximately 15% and, contrary to popular wisdom, it wasn't just the science and engineering majors who benefited. Graduates in the liberal arts also saw their degrees pay off. The benefits of a college diploma also go well beyond direct financial returns. College graduates have lower divorce rates, enjoy healthier lives, have higher rates of health insurance, and much lower rates of incarceration. They also have offspring who are more successful in school. But the United States is falling behind other developed countries when it comes to educating its citizens, and there is a widening gap between the number of college graduates coming from low-income families versus high-income families. In a knowledge-based economy, highly trained workers are key to global competitiveness. At current rates, by 2018 the U.S. will be 3 million college graduates short of what we need to fill expected jobs. By 2025, the shortage will be 16 million. The problem is particularly acute among African-Americans, Latinos, Native Americans and low-income Americans of all races and ethnicities. Students from high-income households are 10 times more likely to attain a college degree than are low-income students. The White House will shine a welcome spotlight on this issue Thursday with its second summit of university presidents and other higher education leaders. We are proud to be representing the University Innovation Alliance (UIA) at this gathering; alliance members are coming to town with plans that are already being put into action to address this troubling disparity in higher education attainment. Raising the degree attainment rate for all Americans, especially those from minority and low-income backgrounds, is vital to our nation's economic future. Universities -- especially public universities -- have a responsibility to find new ways to increase graduation rates for minorities and low-income Americans, so we can improve social mobility, narrow income gaps and produce the graduates required to grow the United States economy. That is why 11 public research universities, including our institutions, Arizona State University and Georgia State University, came together to announce the UIA in the fall. By collaborating instead of competing, we are committed to addressing this problem at scale and sharing strategies that proven to increase college graduation rates. The UIA's first large-scale initiative focuses on predictive analytics, which involves technology designed to mine student data for early signs that a student may be struggling and then reaching out to that student with additional support tailored to his or her specific needs. A great example of the power of this approach comes from Georgia State, where the monitoring of student performance coupled with proactive advising strategies increased semester-to-semester retention rates by 5% and reduced the time needed to earn degree by almost a half-semester. This means 1,200 more students are staying in school every year, and the class of 2014 saved $10 million in tuition and fees compared with graduates a year earlier. And because now students are graduating more quickly, Georgia taxpayers will save about $5 million in support costs for public education. If these same innovations were scaled across the 11 UIA institutions over the next five years, we could educate tens of thousands more students while saving almost $1.5 billion in educational costs to students and taxpayers. That is the kind of transformation higher education needs. At Arizona State, the introduction of technology-enhanced advising services has produced dramatic results: The four-year graduation rate at ASU increased by nearly 20 percentage points between 2002 and 2010, with the most dramatic increase occurring after the introduction of a system called eAdvisor, which allows students to plot their progress toward a degree in real time. Arizona State, like Georgia State, has made investments to boost graduation rates, such as the hiring of hundreds of tutors, the creation of focused learning communities on campus, the introduction of adaptive learning platforms that modify the presentation of educational materials according to a student's performance on tests, quizzes and other exercises (this is especially effective in math classes) and a ""retention dashboard"" that signals to administrators when a student needs additional support. Arizona State's six-year graduation rate stands at 62.5%, and the goal is to achieve a 75% rate by 2020. But these efforts are not about specific innovations at particular institutions. They are about creating opportunities for students and building a stronger society. UIA members are working together to develop and share solutions that will improve the entire higher education sector, because we believe every individual deserves an opportunity to receive a high-quality and affordable education. We know what going it alone can accomplish. It's time to discover what working together can do. We believe when universities collaborate, students win.","Two university presidents say studies show college is worth what it costs .

"Before the transcontinental race in ""Cannonball Run,"" the starter tells the gathered racers, ""You all are certainly the most distinguished group of highway scofflaws and degenerates ever gathered together in one place."" Ed Bolian prefers the term ""fraternity of lunatics."" Where the 1981 Burt Reynolds classic was a comedic twist on a race inspired by real-life rebellion over the mandated 55-mph speed limits of the 1970s, Bolian set out on a serious mission to beat the record for driving from New York to Los Angeles. The mark? Alex Roy and David Maher's cross-country record of 31 hours and 4 minutes, which they set in a modified BMW M5 in 2006. Bolian, a 28-year-old Atlanta native, had long dreamed of racing from East Coast to West. A decade ago, for a high school assignment, Bolian interviewed Brock Yates, who conceived the Cannonball Baker Sea-To-Shining-Sea Memorial Trophy Dash, aka the Cannonball Run. Yates, who played the previously quoted organizer in the film he wrote himself, won the first Cannonball in the early 1970s with a time of 35 hours and 53 minutes. ""I told him, 'One day I'd like to beat your record,' "" Bolian recalled. Ounce of prevention . It sounds like great outlaw fun -- and certainly, Hollywood added its embellishments, like the supremely confident, infidel-cursing sheik with a Rolls Royce and Sammy Davis Jr. in a priest getup -- but Bolian said it took considerable research and groundwork. Beginning in 2009, about the time he started working for Lamborghini Atlanta, Bolian researched cars, routes, moon phases, traffic patterns, equipment, gas mileage and modifications. He went into preparation mode about 18 months ago and chose a Mercedes CL55 AMG with 115,000 miles for the journey. The Benz's gas tank was only 23 gallons, so he added two 22-gallon tanks in the trunk, upping his range to about 800 miles. The spare tire had to go in the backseat with his spotter, Dan Huang, a student at Georgia Tech, Bolian's alma mater. To foil the police, he installed a switch to kill the rear lights and bought two laser jammers and three radar detectors. He commissioned a radar jammer, but it wasn't finished in time for the trek. There was also a police scanner, two GPS units and various chargers for smartphones and tablets -- not to mention snacks, iced coffee and a bedpan. By the time he tricked out the Benz, which included a $9,000 tuneup, ""it was a real space station of a thing,"" he said, describing the lights and screens strewn through the car's cockpit. Yet he still wasn't done. ""The hardest thing, quite honestly, was finding people crazy enough to do it with me,"" he said. Co-driver Dave Black, one of the Atlanta Lamborghini dealership's customers, didn't sign on until three days before they left, and ""support passenger"" Huang didn't get involved until about 18 hours before the team left Atlanta for Manhattan. If his difficulty finding a copilot wasn't an omen, Manhattan would deliver one. While scouting routes out of the city, a GPS unit told Bolian to take a right on red, in the wrong direction down a one-way road. He was quickly pulled over. Bolian got a warning -- and a healthy dose of relief that the officer didn't question the thick odor of fuel as he stood over the vents pumping fumes from the trunk. Speed of sight: The world's fastest blind daredevil . Record run begins . The trio ignored what some might have considered a harbinger and the left the Red Ball Garage on East 31st Street, the starting point for Yates' Cannonball, a few hours later. To be exact, they left October 19 at 9:55 p.m., according to a tracking company whose officials asked not be identified because they were unaware that Bolian would be driving so illegally when he hired them. They hit a patch of traffic in New York that held them up for 15 minutes but soon had an average speed of about 90 mph. In Pennsylvania, they tapped the first of many scouts, one of Bolian's acquaintances who drove the speed limit 150 to 200 miles ahead of the CL55 and warned them of any police, construction or other problems. They blew through Ohio, Indiana and Illinois, hitting St. Louis before dawn. ""Everything possible went perfect,"" Bolian said, explaining they never got lost and rarely encountered traffic or construction delays. By the time they hit southern Missouri, near the Oklahoma border, they learned they were ""on track to break the existing record if they averaged the speed limit for the rest of the trip,"" he said. Yeah, right. This wasn't about doing speed limits. They kept humming west, and as they neared the Texas-New Mexico border, they calculated they might beat the 30-hour mark, a sort of Holy Grail in transcontinental racing that Bolian likened to the 4-minute mile. Not one to settle, ""we decided to break 29,"" Bolian said. The unnamed tracking company says the Benz pulled into the Portofino Hotel and Marina in Redondo Beach, California, at 11:46 p.m. on October 20 after driving 2,803 miles. The total time: 28 hours, 50 minutes and about 30 seconds. ""Most of the time, we weren't going insanely fast,"" Bolian said, not realizing his definition of ""insanely"" is a little different from most folks'. When they were moving, which, impressively, was all but 46 minutes of the trip, they were averaging around 100 mph. Their total average was 98 mph, and their top speed was 158 mph, according to an onboard tracking device. ""Apart from a FedEx truck not checking his mirrors before he tried to merge on top of me, we didn't really have any issues,"" Bolian said. Do not try this at home . He concedes his endeavor was a dangerous one, especially when you consider Bolian slept only 40 minutes of the trip, and co-driver Black slept an hour. But Bolian went out of his way to make it as safe as possible, choosing a weekend day with clear weather and a full moon -- and routes, when possible, with little traffic or construction. ""I had plenty of people at home praying I'd make it safely, and, more importantly, had my wife praying that I wouldn't have to do it again,"" he said, adding he has no children, which was also a factor. ""That was one of the spurs to go ahead and get this over with. That's probably the next adventure."" Asked if the technological advances since the previous record holders made their run gave him an advantage, Bolian replied, ""Absolutely."" Because two teams broke the 32-hour mark in 2006 and 2007, he had a detailed ""guide book"" on how to do it, where they had to rely on word-of-mouth tales from the 1980s. ""I thank Alex for that. We're all adding chapters to the same story of American car culture,"" Bolian said. Alex Roy did not respond to an e-mail seeking comment. Bolian had hoped to revisit that high school interview and tell Yates he'd followed through on that promise to break his record, but Yates now suffers from Alzheimer's. ""I'll pay him a visit just for the sake of it,"" Bolian said, ""but I can't tell him."" Where the Cannonball scofflaws aimed to make a statement about personal freedom, Bolian said he has the utmost respect for law enforcement. His goal was merely to ""add myself and pay tribute to this chapter of automotive history,"" he said. Bolian also hopes that he shattered Roy's record by such a stark margin that it discourages would-be Cannonballers from attempting to break his record, and it's not just a matter of his own legacy, he said. ""It really isn't something we need a whole band of lunatics doing,"" he said. Follow Eliott C.

"An arbitrator Saturday upheld most of New York Yankees slugger Alex Rodriguez's 211-game doping suspension, keeping him out of the 162-game 2014 regular season and the postseason. The ruling by Major League Baseball arbitrator Fredric Horowitz will not only cost Rodriguez $25 million in salary, it also further clouds the groundbreaking career of a player who will turn 40 during the 2015 season. The 162-game suspension -- which is the most severe punishment in baseball history for doping -- highlights baseball Commissioner Bud Selig's recent high-profile crackdown on performance-enhancing drugs. Rodriguez, one of the best players of his generation who was once considered an automatic Hall of Fame candidate, was defiant in a statement released Saturday. He will likely appeal in federal court. ""The number of games sadly comes as no surprise, as the deck has been stacked against me from day one,"" said Rodriguez, who has struggled with hip injuries in recent years. Alex Rodriguez Fast Facts . The former Seattle Mariner, Texas Ranger and now New York Yankee player then took a swipe at Selig, whom he has claimed in the past had an unjustified vendetta against him. ""This is one man's decision that was not put before a fair and impartial jury,"" Rodriguez said, ""does not involve me having failed a single drug test, is at odds with the facts and is inconsistent with the terms of the Joint Drug Agreement and the Basic Agreement, and relies on testimony and documents that would never have been allowed in any court in the United States because they are false and wholly unreliable."" When the suspension ends in 2015, Rodriguez will be owed $61 million in a contract that runs through 2017. Major League Baseball did not release details of the arbitrator's decision, which the players union said it ""strongly disagrees"" with. The Yankees said in a statement that they ""respect Major League Baseball's Joint Drug Prevention and Treatment Program, the arbitration process, as well as the decision released today by the arbitration panel."" Saturday's ruling stemmed from Rodriguez's appeal of a his suspension by MLB, which accused him of taking performance-enhancing drugs and having ties to the now-shuttered Biogenesis clinic in South Florida. Biogenesis was a former anti-aging clinic that MLB said supplied steroids to at least a dozen baseball players. Rodriguez, one of 14 players suspended in the Biogenesis scandal, was the only one who appealed his suspension. Though he was suspended in August, Rodriguez played out the 2013 season because of the appeal. Rodriguez, 38, is fifth on MLB's list of all-time home run leaders, just six behind Willie Mays. Rodriguez, who has claimed he was the target of a MLB ""witch hunt,"" probably will appeal Horowitz's decision in the courts or to seek to delay the suspension. ""No player should have to go through what I have been dealing with, and I am exhausting all options to ensure not only that I get justice, but that players' contracts and rights are protected through the next round of bargaining, and that the MLB investigation and arbitration process cannot be used against others in the future the way it is currently being used to unjustly punish me,"" Rodriguez said in a statement.","The New York Yankees say they ""respect"" the decision .

"U.S. Marines flew a C-130 aircraft Friday into South Sudan's capital to evacuate about 20 U.S. Embassy staff members, according to the Defense Department. U.S. citizens were urged to get out. ""We continue to strongly recommend that U.S. citizens in South Sudan depart immediately,""  said State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf. The U.S. ambassador remains in Juba, the capital, Harf said, and the United States ""remains deeply and actively committed to supporting regional and international efforts to end the violence in South Sudan."" But  the United States isn't taking any chances with it's embassy. ""We are standing by and prepared to respond to any requests from the State Department to evacuate the few remaining personnel that are in Juba,""  Pentagon spokesman Col. Steven Warren said. Representatives of South Sudan's government and rebel forces held peace talks Friday in neighboring Ethiopia's capital Addis Ababa, home of the African Union. South Sudan President Salva Kiir and the rebel leader, former Vice President Riek Machar, are under mounting pressure from African and Western powers to reach a deal to stop clashes that have killed more than 1,000 people and displaced about 200,000. But their first attempt to halt the escalating violence resulted in no breakthrough. ""The first day of proxy talks are over,"" Tigist Hailu, a spokeswoman for  the Intergovernmental  Authority on Development (IGAD), which is mediating the talks, told CNN. She was not authorized to say when the two sides might meet face-to-face. A statement by IGAD refers only to ""positive engagements by the negotiating teams of both parties with the Chair of IGAD."" The talks between the warring sides come amid continued fighting for control of Bor,  the captial city of Jonglei state, which has been the scene of some of the heaviest fighting in the nearly three weeks of violence. Bor's mayor, Majak Nhial, said  the talks are not going to work. ""The rebels are using them to buy time while they are moving forces from the north to the south,"" he said, showing pictures of mangled bodies and destruction purportedly caused by rebels in his town. Military spokesman Col. Philip Aguer told CNN that South Sudan's army was 20 kilometers (about 12 miles) outside the city of Bor on Friday. He said Thursday that the Sudan People's Liberation Army was trying to stop the rebel forces from advancing on the capital, about 200 kilometers (124 miles) away. On Wednesday, Kiir declared a state of emergency for Unity state and for Jonglei state. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and senior U.S. officials have been in touch with Kiir and have spoken with regional leaders, Harf said. The United States is supporting the mediation effort in Ethiopia, she said. Last month, four U.S. troops were injured when their aircraft came under fire as they took part in an abortive mission to evacuate U.S. citizens from Bor by air. United Nations: 200,000 people displaced . South Sudan's neighbors, Western governments and the United Nations have been scrambling to stem the latest conflict in the country, which seceded from Sudan in 2011 after decades of war. The violence has forced about 200,000 people from their homes and affected many hundreds of thousands more indirectly, Toby Lanzer, humanitarian coordinator in South Sudan for the United Nations, said Friday. The fighting in Bor has led as many as 76,000 to seek sanctuary in Awerial, in South Sudan's Lakes state, according to the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. Aid agencies are now providing food and basic healthcare to people there, Lanzer said, but the United Nations is still working to supply clean water and latrines. He urged all parties in the conflict to spare civilians from the fighting and to allow humanitarian workers safe access to them. ""This is the time to stand with the people of South Sudan and over the coming days and weeks we will do all we can to do just that,"" Lanzer said. The United Nations has appealed for $166 million in aid to help provide families with food and other emergency relief. The U.S. State Department announced an additional $49.8 million in humanitarian assistance Friday for the victims of the conflict and refugees seeking help in South Sudan. This brings the aid given by the United States in fiscal years 2013 and 2014 to South Sudan to more than $300 million, it said. Killing 'on ethnic grounds' Kiir and Machar agreed Tuesday to send delegations to Addis Ababa for the talks, . South Sudan's government said Thursday via Twitter: ""We are participating in talks because we want peace for our people even though the rebel groups have not accepted a cessation of hostilities."" Hilde Johnson, who heads the U.N. mission to South Sudan, said Wednesday in Juba that she wanted to see both parties ""take a decisive step to cease all hostilities."" The U.N. mission has voiced concern about what it said was mounting evidence of ethnic-based atrocities across the country. The fighting began in Juba on December 15 but quickly spread across the country, with reports of mass killings soon emerging. Kiir, from South Sudan's Dinka ethnic group, accused troops loyal to Machar, from the Nuer community, of trying to launch a coup. The two men have long been political rivals, and Kiir dismissed Machar, along with the Cabinet, in July.","Marines evacuate about 20 U.S. Embassy staff  from Juba .

Type your Twitter handle into the search field and it spits out your first-ever tweet in its full, date-stamped glory -- typos, clever witticisms, clumsy hashtags and all. You can also look up the first tweet of any other user, from NBA star Kobe Bryant (""The antisocial has become social #mambatweets"") to billionaire Warren Buffett (""Warren is in the house""). Previously, if you wanted to find someone's old messages on Twitter you had to scour Google (if they're famous), do a cumbersome Twitter search, try a social-search tool such as Topsy or -- heaven forbid -- scroll back through hundreds, even thousands, of tweets. Based on a quick review of notable #FirstTweets (yes, it's a trending topic now), many people seemed a little unsure in the beginning about this newfangled Twitter thing. Take Olympic skier Lindsey Vonn, whose first tweet in 2009 said, ""Just started this tweety bird thing... We'll see how it goes. Still skeptical."" Vonn has since tweeted 1,850 more times. Guess she got the hang of it. The first-ever tweet from CNN's breaking-news account in 2007 wasn't news at all (see below), although CNN didn't actually own the account at the time. On March 21, 2006, the first Twitter message was published by Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey, who wrote, ""just setting up my twttr."" Twitter didn't launch to the public until July of that year, but grew steadily as it became recognized as a speedy source for news.

"(CNN) -- London McCabe was a 6-year-old boy. On November 3, he died when his mother threw him off the Yaquina Bay Bridge in Oregon, according to police. London had autism. Media coverage of his death has widely focused on the stresses and challenges of raising a child with autism. In other words, the stories are about his mother and her problems finding help, not the dead boy. This is a mistake. In all cases of violent crime, but especially those involving people with disabilities and their caregivers, we need to mourn the victims, rather than explain away their deaths. Unfortunately, whenever these terrible kinds of tragedies take place, which they do far too often, we do just the opposite. Stories about lack of support services position children with disabilities as burdens to their families. They portray the crime as understandable. Such stories perpetuate the idea that it's better to be dead than to be disabled, that life with disability is life without meaning, and that tired, stressed, caregivers have no hope. No wonder, in such a narrative, the parents do such terrible things. The children, or at least their disabilities, become responsible for their death. Such stories do not just erase the victims, they are also generally inaccurate. In fact, this kind of killing is typically driven not by a lack of services, but by a warped understanding of disability itself. London McCabe did not want to die. London liked big hats. He liked fuzzy stuffed animals. He made a wish on his cupcake for his sixth birthday. In September, his father wrote, ""London is pleased as punch. He lays on our laps and puts our hands together. Last night he made the 'mmmwha!' sound and gave his Mommy a kiss. Then he made the same sound and pushed our faces together. He's all smiles."" But in Jillian McCabe's world, life with autism was so horrific that she allegedly felt obligated to throw her son off a bridge. Now her defense attorneys will offer an account of intense hardship as an excuse for murder, describing a situation so brutal that it seemed a mercy for a 6-year-old boy to die. The contrast between our description of London's likes, dislikes and the last few months and his mother's vision is stark. Such defenses play well with juries. In February 2010, Gigi Jordan forced a lethal cocktail of drugs down the throat of her 8-year-old son. At trial, which concluded Wednesday, the jury found her guilty only of manslaughter, convinced that she was a desperate mother. Jordan's attorney said, ""This was not a murder case. And that's because there were extenuating and horrific circumstances. And, apparently the jurors got it."" Such claims of mercy killing are not about services or support. Gigi Jordan was extremely wealthy. Kelli Stapleton, who was convicted of attempting to kill her daughter Izzy, had received enormous amounts of services in the state of Michigan. Karen McCarron, a physician, enrolled her daughter Katie in a special private school in North Carolina. McCarron smothered her daughter. The mother of Alex Spourdalakis refused additional support from the Illinois Department of Children and Family Services. She killed her son. The common thread is not lack of services, but the parents' own views on disability. According to Ari Ne'eman, president and co-founder of the Autistic Self Advocacy Network, these killings are most commonly perpetrated by parents who have been ""inculcated into an ideology in which it's better to be dead than to be disabled. If they cannot succeed in fixing or curing their child, their child's life has no point."" These parents do not enter into this ideology accidentally. Ne'eman criticized the huge industry dedicated to the eradication of autism through quack treatments and the belief that environmental factors such as vaccines cause the condition (Note: They don't). Such false arguments perpetuate the idea that autism can be beaten through treatment; when treatment fails, some parents turn violent. Indeed, in the months before killing Alex Spourdalakis, his mother, Dorothy Spourdalakis, had turned to anti-vaccination conspiracy theorists such as the group Autism One and Andrew Wakefield, the former doctor and notorious fraud. Wakefield criticized the medical profession for its treatment of Alex and advocated for access to ""cures,"" a campaign that continues today. And it's not just these fringe groups and snake-oil salesmen perpetuating this ideology. Autism Speaks, the biggest autism awareness charity, fundraises through military language mixed with demands for pity. For Autism Speaks, a group that has been criticized for having no people with autism on its board, autism is the enemy that must be eradicated. For someone who sees disability the way Autism Speaks does, and is unable to remove the enemy, murder and suicide seem reasonable. Autism Speaks even acknowledges this line of thought. In 2006, then senior executive Alison Tepper Singer was widely criticized for describing, in a documentary produced by Autism Speaks, that she had contemplated driving off a bridge with her autistic daughter in the car. Singer has since stepped away from those remarks. After the film came out, she wrote, ""The point I was trying to make in the film was that the lack of appropriate services and the thought of putting her in a terrible school made me want to drive off the bridge; not that Jodie did."" She has also since, ""changed [her] behavior and rhetoric."" Still, even if Singer has moved on, the rhetoric persists, and re-emerging now as London McCabe's body is pulled from the water. The McCabe family may well have needed more and better services. There is a time for that conversation, but it isn't now. Ne'eman says, ""Immediately after or in connection to an act of violence or murder against a child with a disability is the disastrously wrong time to have the conversation about services."" Instead, it's time to mourn another death and to work on how we talk about disability, because this story isn't about Jillian McCabe or support. It's about London. He liked hats and stuffed animals. He liked it when his parents kissed. Now he's dead.","London McCabe, a young boy with autism, was allegedly killed by his mother .

"(CNN) -- We were just there to help. That was the message Friday from Jim Allen, one of the 10 American missionaries arrested January 29 in Haiti on child kidnapping charges. Allen, along with seven others, was released this week without needing to post bail. Two members of the group -- including the group's leader, Laura Silsby -- have remained in Haitian custody to answer questions about why they traveled to the country on an earlier trip. Silsby and Charisa Coulter were back in a Haitian courtroom Friday. Silsby said she hoped the legal process would be completed by the end of the day. Allen said he went to Haiti because he ""knew that I had some skills that I could use."" In an appearance on ""Oprah,"" he said he has experience in the construction industry. Allen said he's not angry with Haitian authorities. ""They were going through the legal process [and] ... I think they needed to,"" he said. The 10 missionaries were charged with kidnapping and criminal association for trying to take 33 children out of Haiti after the magnitude-7.0 earthquake that devastated the impoverished country January 12. Allen said the group had been approached by a man at an orphanage who claimed to have a group of children with no parents or access to care. The man asked if ""we could please help,"" he said. Allen claimed that the group intended to bring the children to a temporary orphanage set up at a hotel in the Dominican Republic. When his group returned to the United States, Allen said, another group of volunteers would have taken responsibility for providing care to the children. His arrest by Haitian authorities, he said, was ""quite a shock,"" but he always remained confident that ""as soon as [our] story was told ... we'd be coming home."" Being in jail was hard, he added, but the Haitian police ""treated us as well as they could with what they had."" The missionaries slept on a concrete floor while in jail but ""had a roof over our head"" and a hot meal once a day, he said.

A large number of Haitians ""had it worse than I had it,"" he said. Allen said he had no indication that there is any truth to the charge that Silsby was hoping to profit from the mission by looking for children she could later place with families for large fees. The missionaries were ""legitimately interested"" in helping the children, he claimed. They had ""good intentions."" Allen dismissed as ""a complete fabrication"" reports that eight members of the group signed a note saying they had been misled by Silsby. He said he has ""no ill feelings toward anybody"" Phyllis Allison, Allen's mother, recently said that her son's captivity in Haiti had ""been awful, but we just trusted in God"" that he would return home. Allen, along with the seven other released missionaries, arrived at Miami International Airport late Wednesday night on a U.S. Air Force C-130 cargo plane from the Haitian capital, Port-au-Prince. Lawyer Gary Lissade, who represents Allen, has said the fact that the judge released the Americans on their own recognizance may indicate that the charges will be eventually dropped.

"A spectacular closing ceremony brought an end to the 2014 Sochi Paralympic Games Sunday. In front of Russian President Vladimir Putin, the ceremony embraced the theme of ""Reaching the Impossible."" Some 547 athletes from 45 countries competed for the 72 gold medals on offer -- with host nation Russia coming out on top. Russia claimed 30 gold medals and 80 in total, way ahead of Germany which finished in second place. On the day where a referendum was held in Crimea, Ukraine flagbearer, biathlete and cross-country skier Lyudmila Pavlenko entered the stadium wearing a top emblazoned with the word ""Peace"". But her actions did not overshadow a ceremony which involved 462 performers and 8,000 volunteers. International Paralympic Commitee president Philip Craven told spectators at the stadium: ""The Paralympic Spirit has united and infected us all. Proud Paralympians -- your inspirational athletic performances have redefined the boundaries of possibility. ""You have shown the world that absolutely anything is possible and that life is about amazing capabilities and not perceived deficiencies. ""With record numbers of highly enthusiastic spectators supporting you all, you have shown what real grit and determination looks like. Through record TV audiences and media coverage, you have opened up the eyes of the world to what the human spirit can achieve."" Russia's hero of the Games was Roman Petushkov who won six gold medals -- the most by any individual at a single Paralympics. The 36-year-old, who lost both his legs in a car accident eight years ago, made his Paralympic debut in Vancouver where he won two medals. After winning five world titles in the Sweden last year, he responded to the pressure magnificently with six golds. Competing in the seated division of cross country and biathlon, he won the 7.5kilometer, 12km and 15km biathlon as well as the cross country 1km, 15km and the 4x2.5km relay. One of the other outstanding stories of the Games was the achievement of Brian McKeever, who won his 10th Paralympic title. The 34-year-old visually impaired cross-country skier, competing in his fourth Paralympics, won three gold medals in Sochi and could yet defend his titles at Korea 2018. Germany's Anna Schaffelhuber was a five-time gold medal winner at Sochi following a series of sublime sit-ski displays. Schaffelhuber  won the women's giant slalom Sunday to go on top of the downhill, super G, slalom and super combined in the women's sitting class in Sochi. Speaking at the closing ceremony, Russia's deputy prime minister, Dmitry Kozak, told spectators that the Games ""had gone far beyond sports competitions."" He said: They showed what people from different countries and nationalities different cultures and traditions are capable of when they are united by a single goal and an inspired dream. ""Attitudes toward people with an impairment have changed among Russian society. The Paralympic Winter Games have become a catalyst for our efforts to create a barrier-free environment in Russia. ""The Games are over, but we promise that this important work will continue throughout our vast country.""","Sochi Paralympics ended Sunday .

"""Mad Men"" showrunner Matthew Weiner has always been a stickler for detail, but his latest bid for period accuracy is pretty stringent even by his own high standards. Weiner is changing a song used in the upcoming fifth season premiere after critics who received early copies of the episode pointed out an apparent oversight: The track, Dusty Springfield's 1967 tune ""The Look of Love,"" wasn't released until six months after the episode takes place. The writer-producer will use a different song instead. He sent this explanatory note to critics, which also doesn't exactly hurt your relationship with the press: . ""Dear Journalist: . As you know, one of the things I love best about 'Mad Men' is the passionate response I get from members of the press. Recently a few of you have mentioned that the song ""The Look of Love,"" used in our season five premiere episode, was not actually released until six months after the episode takes place. Because of this we have replaced this song with one more suited to the time period and you, along with our audience, will hear it for the first time during our March 25th broadcast. Although we take license for artistic purposes with the end-title music, we never want the source music to break from the time period we are trying to recreate. As someone who has a deep appreciation for details, I want to thank you for bringing this to our attention.  It's a privilege to work on a show that generates an ongoing dialog with you and our amazing fans so please -- keep those notes and comments coming! All the best, .

"(CNN)Inked on Croatian teenager Borna Coric's arm are the words: ""There's nothing worse in life than being ordinary."" Andy Murray got a taste of the 18-year-old Coric's pursuit of the extraordinary as the Croatian pulled off one of the biggest upsets of his nascent tennis career with a straight sets victory over the world No. 3. Few had given Coric much chance of winning the pair's quarterfinal contest at the Dubai Championships, his last victory against a top-10 ranked player dating back to a historic win over Rafael Nadal at the end of 2014. Luck had played a part in Coric's path to the last eight after he had initially lost to 350th-ranked Fabrice Martin in qualifying and he only snuck into the tournament by virtue of a lucky-loser berth. But in a thoroughly one-sided quarterfinal contest, the teen served up a 6-1, 6-3 victory as Murray struggled to make inroads with 55 unforced errors. Runner-up at the Australian Open last month, Murray mustered just 38 points in the 80-minute match. The Briton was in Dubai without coach Amelie Mauresmo and had previously admitted to struggling to find playing partners. But he made no excuses in the aftermath of his defeat. ""He didn't make any errors,"" Murray told the ATP World Tour website. ""He played very solid and he moved well. I made way too many mistakes from the beginning of the match right through to the end, early in the rallies, rushing points."" It was a far cry from the pair's last encounter in a Davis Cup tie in 2013. Prior to that contest, Coric had admitted he had no chance of victory. But the world No. 84 has grown noticeably in confidence, saying in a recent interview that he was ""the best of his generation."" Coric has been tipped for a place among the world's top 10 and Murray, for one, has noticed the improvement. ""He makes good decisions on the court, he's stronger now, he serves a bit better,"" said Coric. ""His ranking would suggest that he's made some big improvements.""","18-year-old Borna Coric beats Andy Murray in straight sets in Dubai quarter-final .

"Fancy a different face but can't afford to go under the knife? Thailand's Tourism Authority has launched an Extreme Makeover contest, offering three lucky ladies a chance to win free facial surgery along with a shot at $5,000 and a luxury vacation. To enter, you'll have to submit photos showing your face from various angles, along with a health profile and written explanation of why you so badly covet a makeover. The judging committee, made up of medical experts and surgeons, will then pick the three winners. Finalists will be announced on May 7. Naturally there's a catch. You'll have to let all your insecurities play out online through videos and photos uploaded to the Extreme Makeover website while you're in Thailand for the surgery. You'll also be subjected to the scrutiny of public voters, who'll ultimately decide whether you deserve some cash to go with your new face. The contender with the highest number of votes gets the $5,000 and a luxury tour package. The two runners-up will also get their own luxury tour packages. According to the rules, the Extreme Makeover contest is open to non-Thai women between 25 and 45 years of age who are able to stay in Thailand for a month. If the official competition video is anything to go by, the contest is aimed at those looking to become the ""ultimate beauty"" thanks to this ""life changing opportunity"" that will make their ""dreams into a reality."" All you have to do is ""click and remain forever young."" The finalists agree to give the Thailand Extreme Makeover project the right to use their names, images, videos and/or audio before and after surgery for display, public relations via online and offline media and domestic and international marketing. Thailand already a medical tourism hotspot . Though the competition was launched to promote medical tourism in Thailand, the country is already considered an industry leader. ""Malaysia, Thailand and South Korea are examples where government support has proved very successful at increasing business year on year, while places like India where governments have done little have seen numbers fall,"" says a new report by the International Medical Tourism Journal. Thailand has 30 healthcare organizations accredited by the U.S.-based Joint Commission International, considered a leading evaluator of global heath care quality and safety. For an international hospital to be accredited, it must meet the same set of standards as U.S. hospitals. Josef Woodman, CEO of U.S.-based medical travel consumer guide Patients Beyond Borders (PBB), tells CNN an estimated 920,000 to 1.2 million medical tourists came to Thailand in 2013, which represents around 10% of the worldwide patient flow for international medical travel. However, due to this year's political and social unrest, current flows are 40% off, along with the rest of tourism. ""We expect that to bounce back as usual when things clear up,"" he adds. So just how much cheaper is it to get your face lift or hip replacement surgery in Thailand? Average savings for those visiting from the United States are in the 50-70% range, if you use U.S. costs across a variety of specialties and procedures as a benchmark, says Woodman. But sometimes that figure can reach 80-85% for the more expensive procedures such as heart and spine work, he adds.","Thailand Tourism Authority launches contest offering free facial surgery .

"""I'm gonna tag you in this hideous photo and then unfriend you if you don't stop oversharing and poking me."" If you said this to someone 10 years ago, they'd look at you like you were speaking Klingon. Nowadays, you just sound like an active user of social media. This is how much Facebook has changed how we talk. In the decade since its birth in February 2004, the social network has introduced numerous terms and phrases to the language of modern life. Most are common words that Facebook refitted with new meanings. Some have stuck, while others have been forgotten. A few have even been recognized by dictionaries as official pieces of the 21st century lexicon. Here are nine of the most memorable. Friend . Until Facebook came along, nobody used the word ""friend"" as a verb. Now it's not uncommon to ask a new acquaintance to spell their name so you can friend them on Facebook. Everyone likes to feel popular. That's why some Facebookers, especially in the site's early days, hoarded friends like poker chips (never mind that most of these ""friends"" were rarely seen co-workers, distant relatives or vaguely remembered classmates from junior high). Nobody really has 583 ""friends."" Facebook's ""friend"" also was the precursor to Twitter's ""follower,"" which makes a user's social contacts sound like members of a cult. Unfriend . Facebook giveth, and Facebook taketh away. Are you tired of your uncle's political rants? Unfriend him! By adding an ""unfriend"" option, Facebook created new shorthand for aborting a friendship or an acquaintance. It's a lot easier to say, ""I unfriended Bob"" than ""I'm not going to be friends with Bob anymore because he annoys me with his daily musings about his toenails."" Unfriending someone is considered a more drastic step than simply tweaking your Facebook settings to block or minimize their posts. The term was officially welcomed to the digital-age vernacular by the New Oxford English Dictionary, which named ""unfriend"" its Word of the Year for 2009. Status update . Years ago, ""status"" was a measure of someone's social or professional standing. Then Facebook began asking users to post updates on their thoughts or activities, and ""updating your status"" suddenly meant more than just moving to a better neighborhood. To prompt updates, Facebook first asked users, ""What are you doing right now?"" When that produced too many mundane reports -- ""Sally is eating toast!"" -- Facebook changed the update question in 2009 to the broader, ""What's on your mind?"" Like . Few things have sparked more debate on Facebook than the ""Like"" button, which debuted in 2009 and soon spread to partner sites. Suddenly, with a quick click you could endorse your friends' updates, jokes and cute-kid pictures. Cynics, lamenting what they saw as Facebook's forced cheerfulness, unsuccessfully asked for a ""Dislike"" button. Instagram, Pinterest and other social networks also adopted the Like model for favoring posts, although they used a heart symbol instead of a Like thumb. (You Like me right now! You Like me!) All this made ""Like"" a noun as well as a verb, as users began collecting Likes as a measure of engagement and popularity. As in, ""I can't believe my cute picture of Fluffy in her Easter bonnet got only three Likes."" 5 ways Facebook changed our lives, for better or worse . Poke . The weird Poke feature was sort of a thing in Facebook's early days. Nobody knew what it was for, exactly -- even Mark Zuckerberg once said of the Poke, ""We thought it would be cool to have a feature without any specific purpose."" Some saw it as a flirty invitation to an online chat or real-world hookup. But the obvious sexual innuendo made it awkward to use in conversation. ""I poked Aunt Betty"" just sounds all kind of wrong. Amazingly, the Poke function is still active on Facebook. But nobody uses it anymore unless they're being ironic. Share (and overshare) Sharing used to be something we did in school when there weren't enough textbooks to go around. Then came Facebook, and everyone -- not just the generous -- became sharers. Or over-sharers. Soon it wasn't enough to just experience a memorable moment in our daily lives: We had to share it with everyone, RIGHT NOW! Share buttons popped up all over the Web. Share this! Tweet this! Pin this! Snap this! Sooo much sharing. The word ""share"" has always implied a selfless, charitable act. But the more we share our every move and thought on social media, the more self-centered we can tend to sound. Not me, of course. Other people. Wall . For years, Facebook encouraged visitors to a friend's profile to ""write on their Wall."" It sounded sort of illicit, like an invitation to scribble graffiti. The idea of a digital ""wall"" seemed odd at a time when other social networks were promoting pages. Maybe that's why it never really caught on. In 2011, Facebook replaced the Wall with the current Timeline format, which displays updates chronologically. It's complicated . This ambiguous answer to Facebook's ""What's your relationship status?"" could apply to almost any romantic entanglement between ""single"" and ""married"" and is more interesting than either. It's become a common response to the ""How's your love life?"" question and even inspired a 2009 romantic comedy with Meryl Streep. Tag . Tag, you're it! No, you're it! What was once just a child's game is now a way to get people to notice your posts, or to embarrass them by flagging them in unflattering photos. Come to think of it, maybe Tag is the new Poke.","Facebook has contributed numerous terms to the language of modern life .

"Washington (CNN)Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush's surprise announcement that he'll ""actively explore"" a presidential bid Tuesday morning did little to dissuade his potential Republican opponents from the race. Following the news, South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, who might make a White House bid, offered the clearest pitch yet for his own candidacy. ""I think I have a unique ability to deal with the threats we face at home and abroad and the challenges here, which is finally getting the government to work and dealing with a dangerous world,"" he told reporters on Capitol Hill. He said to ""stay tuned"" for his plans. ""I think there are a lot of people in the donor class who are looking for multiple voices, including Jeb's, and competition is a good thing,"" Graham said, adding, ""He's got a lot to offer the Republican Party and the country."" Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul was upbeat about the governor's announcement. ""I think we're a big tent — we can use moderates, conservatives, libertarians — we need 'em all,"" he told reporters. ""I think the more the merrier — the public will determine"" whether Bush could win. And Florida Sen. Marco Rubio's spokesman, Alex Conant, said while Rubio has ""a lot of respect"" for Bush and thinks he'd make ""a formidable candidate,"" Bush's decision has no bearing on his own. ""Marco's decision on whether to run for president or re-election will be based on where he can best achieve his agenda to restore the American Dream — not on who else might be running,"" Conant said. Many observers believe if Bush jumps in the race, Rubio — who's been mentored by the former Florida governor since his entry into politics — wouldn't run. But a source close to Rubio said Tuesday that while Tuesday's announcement changes the dynamic of the race, the junior Florida senator is still ""on track to run for president"" in 2016. Another potential opponent, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, barely acknowledged that the two could face off in the primary fight. ""I think what Republicans want is someone who will stand up and lead, who will take on the great challenges of the day, who will make the case that the path we're on isn't working; that the Obama-economy is a disaster, that Obamacare is a trainwreck, that our constitutional rights are under assault and that we need to restore America's leadership in the world,"" he said. Sen. John Thune of South Dakota, who recently left the door open to his own 2016 bid, said the Bush announcement was ""kind of expected."" Now, though, ""everyone is starting to feel pressure to start making moves,"" he said. But even though Bush is seen as one of the top establishment picks in the primary if he runs, it was clear Tuesday morning he'll still have some work to convince some party leaders. Arizona Sen. John McCain, the GOP's 2008 presidential nominee, wouldn't disclose what he discussed in his recent meeting with Bush, only that they went over the ""ins and outs"" of a presidential campaign. He wouldn't back the governor, either, since he's still waiting to see whether Graham, who McCain called his ""closest friend,"" decides to run. Bush would enter the race with his ""contributors, his family name, a long record as very successful governor,"" McCain said. Sen. Rob Portman, considered a possible vice presidential pick, told reporters he has talked to Bush recently about a potential campaign. ""He'll be a strong candidate,"" said Portman, who recently announced he would be running for re-election rather than the White House in 2016. None of the GOP senators noted one of Bush's biggest liabilities in a GOP presidential primary, however — his support for policies anathema to conservative Republicans. Bush's support for Common Core educational standards and his previous openness to a pathway to citizenship have drawn him many critics on the far-right, and he'll face a challenge in winning over some of those primary voters. Soon after his announcement, the Conservative Action Fund, an outside spending group, emailed its supporters asking them to sign a petition urging Bush not to run and decrying him as ""another establishment, compromising"" Republican. But even right-wing firebrand Cruz on Tuesday held his fire when given the opportunity to attack Bush on one of his primary vulnerabilities, immigration reform. ""Immigration will be a critical issue in this next election because we have a President who has been unwilling to work with Congress on common sense immigration reform,"" Cruz said, when asked how Bush's position on immigration would play out in the primaries. And some Republicans on Capitol Hill argued Bush still had a lot of work to do simply building the operation and support he'd need to compete in a primary. New Hampshire Sen. Kelly Ayotte, also seen as a possible vice presidential pick, noted Bush has yet to stop by her state — which hosts the first primary in the nation — to meet with grassroots activists. ""I don't care who you are, you have to do the hard work in New Hampshire,"" she said. ""You gotta do the grassroots. You gotta get down there and talk to the activists."" She acknowledged that he'd have ""the Bush name recognition,"" but said there's no substitute for hard retail politicking in the Granite State. ""It will make a difference how hard the candidates work in terms of meeting the activists and answering the hard questions,"" Ayotte said. CNN's Ted Barrett contributed to this report .","Sen. Rand Paul welcomed Bush into the race: ""The more the merrier!""

"(CNN)""Uncle"" Hammad, a local Bedouin camel farmer is staring at me as though I've offended him. I'm midway through a luxurious sand safari exploring the deserts of Dubai, and Hammad has been chatting to me over a traditional Emirati breakfast of cardamom-scented crepes slathered in date honey. I've asked him how he's been affected by Dubai's transformation from desert outpost to international city in the space of 25 years, and now I'm bracing myself for a lecture on the blight of modernity and how materialists like me are tainting his land. ""My grandfather had a tent and a camel ..."" He pauses and raises his graying eyebrows at me, then his face crinkles into a sun-beaten smile. ""And I have a five-bedroom villa with AC, and a race horse! Do you think I don't like that?"" Turns out he's a happy man. Dubai's Bedouin are no longer dusty nomads searching for a home -- they're now a part of the emirate's modern landscape of glamorous golf estates, tall towers, shopping malls and theme parks. Despite appearances, their history and natural culture can still be explored, as I discovered a day earlier when I joined the Platinum Heritage safari team at the edge of the Dubai Conservation Reserve. Pristine desert . The platinum part of this safari refers to the Reserve, Dubai's most pristine desert, but could also refer to the five-star treatment we receive while exploring it. The heritage? Open-top Land Rovers from the 1950s, bumblebee yellow or racing green, older than the unified country they're driving across, wheels like concrete, sounding like lawn mowers. Before we set off, Sharaf, our Egyptian mirror aviator-shaded driver, brought out some black and white keffiye headscarves. As we wrapped ourselves under instruction, I cringed on the inside -- who doesn't feel like a charlatan in another culture's national dress? -- but soon found out how necessary they were. When the cars pick up speed they throw up sand and the tail of the headscarf can be pulled over to give faces protection from the grit. There was to be no ""dune bashing"" on this trip, explained Sharaf. Apart from the obvious incompatibility with these classic cars, it can be devastating to the desert eco-system. It kills off sensitive environments for animals living under ground, which make up 95% of the land fauna found in the natural areas of Dubai. We weaved gently over dunes and stopped at various points for photographs. In some, the sands were golden, bare and desolate, scattered with the bones of petrified trees, disappearing in waves to the horizon. In other areas sands were tawny, shaded by giant ghaf trees and Arabian gums, with scrub protecting the tiny animals dwelling there. Aerial acrobatics . At one meager watering hole, delicate gazelles and lumbering oryx waited on the perimeter. They weren't camera shy, but they wouldn't return until we left. Later we were driven to a higher point where carpets were arranged on the sand before a natural amphitheater. Falcons waited on a roost, hooded but untethered. DEWA the Peregrine (named after the local power company whose lines this lazy bird likes to sit on) and Wasp, a Barbary falcon, put on a show with their trainer as the sun disappeared over the city lights of distant Dubai. The birds never touched us, but beat our heads with bursts of air as they swooped close enough to make us squeal. At dusk we entered our camp for the night -- a stone-ringed compound established by Sheikh Butti al Maktoum, and provided to Platinum Heritage on the proviso that they provide a genuine insight to Emirati culture. We talked with the few other passengers and drivers over dates and gahwa (Arabic coffee), before the ouzi (spiced, whole roasted lamb) was brought from its charcoal pit. In desert silence we ate traditional food, delicious and exotic -- even to me, a longtime resident of Dubai. As lgeimats (addictive little Emirati donuts) were brought out, we were entertained with traditional Khaleeji dances in which women sway their long, black hair, and Yolas, in which men tap rhythms with camel canes. We smoked shisha seated on rugs around a bonfire until the desert chill sent us to bed in our camelhair tent nearby. Scary driving . The Platinum Heritage experience is different from many desert safaris on offer. The others range in the details and intensity, but the formula is usually the same -- pickup in a white Land Cruiser, travel in convoy to the edge of the desert where tires are deflated for traction in the sand. Drivers proceed to scare the wits out of tourists by throwing the cars over dunes in a way I'm sure Toyota would revoke their warranties for. I once took a GoPro camera on one of these drives. All the footage I got was sand and sky, glimpses of the interior of the car and howls of a freaked out Scotswoman in the back seat, a broken record of ""No, no, no, no, no, no, nooooooo!"" punctuated by an occasional squeak or the sound of someone gagging. Some of these safaris then round off the terror with disappointment -- an evening in a fenced compound filled with camels and quad bikes, a low quality buffet, beers and a belly dancer from Russia. I've been on too many of these, not realizing what I was really missing out on until now. The morning brings both sunshine and a clear head. The cold breeze of the night has cleaned the sands, leaving only the prints of mystery desert fauna. Hammad laughs and chatters as if we're family, welcoming us into a culture that remains hidden for so many visitors to the UAE. He shows us that it's there for anyone to find, they just need to know where to look. How to explore the sands . Platinum Heritage offers a range of safari options, including the vintage Land Rover tours, private night safaris, dinner safaris, camel safaris, wildlife drives and Bedouin breakfasts and falconry experiences. If dune bashing and belly dancing are more your thing, Arabian Adventures is the largest operator. There are others. Those who prefer to do the driving themselves should get in touch with Off Road Zone, which runs half-day desert driving courses. Al Maha Resort offers the nature without the adventure, but with a whole lot of luxury. The resort is connected to the Dubai Conservation Reserve and has gazelles and oryx wandering free within its grounds. Prices start at about 6,000 AED ($1,600) per room per night.","Vintage Land Rover safaris explore the delicate sand dunes of Dubai .

"To quash what he described as ""irrational fear,"" New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Friday he'll ride one of the three subway lines taken by the latest Ebola patient in the United States.

The governor said he spoke to President Barack Obama on Thursday night, as well as Ebola czar Ron Klain about the situation. New York has been well prepared for an Ebola case, Cuomo said, and he believes they have the system in place to handle the recent diagnosis.

"One of the most striking aspects of the massive protests that have broken out across Egypt is the intensity of the people's anger directed at the Muslim Brotherhood. Welcome to the second wave of the Egyptian revolution. Millions of people have poured onto the streets, marking the first anniversary of Mohammed Morsy's swearing-in as Egypt's president with a demand that he step down immediately and make way for new elections. If Morsy refuses, they plan a campaign of civil disobedience that could paralyze the country. Now the army has stepped in with an ultimatum, telling Morsy he has 48 hours to satisfy the protesters' demands. The organizers, a group known as Tamarod or ""rebel,"" say they have already collected 22 million signatures in support of their demands. That's far more than the 13 million votes Morsy -- the candidate of the Muslim Brotherhood -- received in the presidential election, and a sign that discontent has spread beyond the liberals, or former regime supporters. The opposition's push for new elections has clearly capitalized on Morsy's dismal record, particularly on the economy's downward spiral and the chaotic security situation. But there's more to this protest than a call for jobs, bread and safe streets. Morsy has few friends as deadline looms . Underpinning the calls for change is a growing understanding of the meaning of democracy, and an increasingly pervasive sense that what Egypt has had under Morsy is not the system that Egyptians had in mind in 2011 when they overthrew a deeply entrenched dictatorship. When Egyptians poured into the streets in early 2011, they wanted to topple Hosni Mubarak, the dictator who had ruled the country for three decades. They succeeded in ending dictatorship, but their revolution took a sharply different turn from the one envisioned by the young idealists who occupied Cairo's Tahrir Square. Unlike the Brotherhood, Mubarak's rule had no overarching ideology other than cementing his hold on power. The Brotherhood, by contrast, has a distinct ideology, and it is moving steadily, if gradually, to put it into place. It essentially wants to use its interpretation of Islam as the guiding principle for the individual, society and the state. And it ultimately wants to unify all Muslim states into one, to ""liberate them from foreign imperialism."" What happens to the Brotherhood in Egypt will affect Brotherhood parties across the region. Already its image of incompetence and noninclusiveness is a stain that will be difficult to erase. In Egypt, Islamist parties quickly moved to the forefront of the post-Mubarak political scene. The Ikhwan, as the Brotherhood is known, had a head start in political organizing. It competed on a stage where other parties had barely taken shape, vying for voters who had practically no experience with democracy. Not surprisingly, the Brotherhood won every election, although its margin of victory steadily narrowed. Liberal activists had struggled to explain to voters a number of basic democratic concepts, such as secularism, protection of minorities and rule of law. Now Morsy and the Brotherhood have done Egypt a great service by demonstrating what these ideas mean. Many Egyptian protesters accuse Morsy of governing for the benefit of the Muslim Brotherhood rather than for the country as a whole. A year under Morsy has shown some of the important yet subtle aspects of democratic rule, such as the fundamental concept that winning elections does not mean the winner gets to ignore all the concerns of the opposition. The Brotherhood's intentions and Morsy's credibility started to become troubling when they repeatedly broke their word. They vowed not to field a candidate for president, not to seek to control the parliament, not to try to dominate the constitution-writing process. And they broke every promise. Morsy's reputation took a steep dive after he seized dictatorial powers in November. The protests forced him to reverse course, but he failed to lead the country through its ""Constitutional Moment,"" the pivotal period in history when it has the opportunity to reach a national consensus -- much more than an electoral victory -- to write a constitution that is embraced as legitimate by the nation as a whole. Instead, Morsy and the Ikhwan have taken their thin electoral victory as justification for gradually expanding their hold on the country's institutions. They rammed through a constitution that does not provide a strong guarantee of equality for women and for minorities. They have allegedly worked to suppress critical media, allowed inflammatory speech against non-Sunni Muslims, and rejected all criticism as work of foreigners and ""falool,"" as nostalgic remnants of the Mubarak dictatorship are known. They have gone after nongovernmental organizations, seeking to hollow out the influence of grass-root groups, particularly those working on democracy education. Ironically, one year under a Muslim Brotherhood government has proven quite helpful in educating Egyptians about democracy. Morsy and the Ikhwan have inadvertently helped explain how in a democracy, the rights and the voices of minorities, even of election losers, must be heard. They have unwittingly shed some light on the complicated concept of secularism. In the first wave of elections, many voters thought if they were Muslim -- as most Egyptians are -- they should vote for the Muslim Brotherhood. And they thought secular was synonymous with atheist. Now they're discovering how religion can be exploited for power. Egyptians accuse Morsy and the Brotherhood of engaging in a process of ""Ikhwaninzation,"" a quest to take control of state institutions and impose their Islamist views on the population. Unfortunately for Morsy and the Brotherhood the protesters are more experienced this time around. Egyptians have learned that it's not enough to topple a dictator. It is unclear where this second wave will lead. The opposition is still divided and its small component parts may still not be large enough to defeat an Ikhwan party in a new election. But the protests are a sign that the revolution is far from over, and this time its target is the Muslim Brotherhood.","Millions take to the streets to protest against Egyptian President Mohammed Morsy .

"The Republican-led Senate plans to force a showdown with President Barack Obama over the Keystone XL pipeline as soon as new members take office in January. Soon-to-be Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, said a measure authorizing construction of the 1,179-mile Canada-to-Texas pipeline will be the first bill he'll schedule for a vote. ""People want jobs. And this project will create well-paying, high-wage jobs for our people and it certainly does enjoy a lot of bipartisan support,"" McConnell told reporters on Tuesday. If passed, it would force Obama to decide whether to veto what could be the first bill the new Congress sends to his desk. The President has said he wants the decision left in the hands of the State Department, which is six years into a review of the project and currently holds final authority because the pipeline would cross international borders . McConnell said he will allow amendments to the bill, which is sponsored by Sen. John Hoeven, R-North Dakota. ""I would hope senators on both sides will offer energy-related amendments but there will be no effort to micromanage the amendment process and we'll move forward and hopefully be able to pass a very important job-creating bill early in the session,"" McConnell said. The House has repeatedly approved a bill that would take the Keystone decision out of the Obama administration's hands, end the review and give the project the green light. The Democratic-led Senate ignored that bill for months, but during the lame-duck session -- with Senate Energy Chairwoman Mary Landrieu, D-Louisiana, days away from a runoff election and looking for a way to show her clout -- came up one vote shy of advancing it. Afterward, McConnell shrugged off that vote, pledging that the measure would return -- and fare better -- once new lawmakers took office and Republicans gained control of the Senate.

"NOUAKCHOTT, Mauritania (Reuters) -- Mauritanian police found 1,896 lbs (860 kilograms) of cocaine hidden beneath sacks of rice in a parked minibus in the West African country's biggest drug bust, police said late on Monday. The region has become a major hub for Colombian cocaine being trafficked to highly lucrative markets in Europe, where illegal use of the white powder is a growing problem and street prices are significantly higher than in the United States. Mauritanian authorities made the find while investigating who was behind the smuggling of a previous batch of more than 600 kilograms of cocaine seized after a small plane made an emergency landing at the northern port of Noudhibou in May. ""During our investigations we noticed a parked minibus which looked different from other such vehicles even though it had registration plates from this country,"" Police Commissioner Ely Ould Sneiba, director of the country's anti-drugs office, said. ""The investigating judge ordered the police to search the minibus and inside they found 21, 50-kg sacks full of cocaine hidden beneath sacks of rice,"" he said. The drugs were packed in 761 bricks, each weighing by 1.13 kg. Four people were detained in the operation, including one person from Mauritania and one from Western Sahara, which is claimed by Morocco, itself known as a major source of smuggled hashish. Law enforcement officials say Guinea-Bissau, which adjoins Mauritania's southern neighbor Senegal, is a major hub in a network of sea, land and air routes spanning the Atlantic and much of Africa which are used by Latin American drugs gangs to ferry their valuable contraband to Europe and the Middle East.

"Washington (CNN) -- Texas Gov. Rick Perry may not be dancing with rabbis this Hanukkah season*, but the Lone Star State's outgoing chief is still looking to find common ground with the Chosen. Perry released a statement on the first night of Hanukkah comparing the plight of the Maccabeesâ€”Jewish rebels who fought back the Seleucid Empire in the second century B.C.â€”to that of American tea partiers under British rule. ""It is fitting that the first night of Chanukah falls this year on the anniversary of the Boston Tea Party,"" Perry said in a statement Tuesday. ""The same spirit of freedom that inspired the Maccabees to rise up against a foreign empire motivated our Founding Fathers to rebel against the Crown on that fateful night. They knew, as the Jewish people know, that the few can overcome the many, that right can defeat might, that faith can transcend persecution. No matter how vast the darkness, all it takes is one candle to spread the light."" Perry, who has hinted at a second run for the presidency in 2016, also used the occasion as a reminder of his support for the modern Jewish state, a must for any White House candidate. ""Our Republic, like the light of the ancient Menorah, has lasted longer than anyone could have predicted. America remains a beacon of hope in difficult times for the world, he said. ""And Chanukah reminds us of the power of faith to sustain a nation and ensure the security of our ally, Israel."" But the award for best attempt at Jewish outreach from a gentile governor with White House dreams goes to Wisconsin Republican Gov. Scott Walker. The son of a Baptist preacher, Walker, in an undated letter released in an August document dump but which didn't surface in the media until this December, concluded his correspondence to a constituent asking if he would light a Menorah in the state capitol for Hanukkah with the words, ""Thank you again and Molotov.""

"Teens are losing some of their rebellious reputation with this news from the federal government. The latest Monitoring the Future survey, released on Tuesday by the National Institute on Drug Abuse, finds children are smoking fewer cigarettes, drinking less alcohol and abusing fewer prescription and synthetic drugs. Deadly high: How synthetic drugs are killing kids . Marijuana rates are stable, even with the increase in the number of states that allow people to use marijuana recreationally. Some 6.5% of eighth graders said they had smoked marijuana in the past month, 16.6% of 10th graders did and 21.2% of 12th graders had, according to the survey. In states with medical marijuana laws, 40% of 12th graders who reported using marijuana in the past year said they had it contained in food. That's compared to 26% who said the same in states where the drug is not legal for any kind of use. Agonized parents plea: Beware synthetic drug dangers . There has been a decline in the number of children trying synthetic drugs like K2/Special, also known as synthetic marijuana, in the two years the survey has measured this in all three grades. Use among 12th graders this year was 5.8%, compared to 7.9% last year and 11.3% in 2012, the survey said. There was also a sharp drop in binge drinking among high school seniors, which is now under 20%, compared to 1998 when binge drinking among high school seniors was at a peak of 31.5%. The number of young adults who have tried e-cigarettes is up, according to this report, but that's in large part because e-cigarette use has never been measured before by this survey. Frequent teen marijuana use linked to issues later in life . An unrelated study published Monday in the journal Pediatrics found that 29% of teens surveyed in Hawaii in 2013 used e-cigarettes, a number much higher than reported in previous surveys. The general decline in drug and alcohol use by teens is part of a two-decade long trend among American teens. ""The main highlight is that for most indicators the news is very good,"" said NIDA Director Dr. Nora Volkow. A research psychiatrist and scientist, Volkow said she is encouraged by this significant decline, particularly in synthetic drugs and prescription drugs, which had been a growing problem for teens. She doesn't, however, think parents and teachers should be complacent. ""We need to continue to be very aggressive as far as interventions and to continue to curb abuse."" Growing number of calls to poison centers involve kids . An increasing number of children have tried e-cigarettes: Some 17% of 12th graders surveyed had used them in the last month. Sixteen percent of 10th graders did, as had 8% of eighth graders.  ""If you think about a new device, those rates are very high,"" Volkow said. The patterns for other drug use are similar to other surveys. Researchers have seen a decline over the past five years in use of  prescription pain medicine and haven't seen an uptick in use of other drugs like heroin to compensate for the decline. The rate of abuse of the painkiller Vicodin, for instance, has dropped significantly from the peak abuse use five years ago, according to Volkow.  It fell from 9.5% of those surveyed using it to 4.8% now. ""This is quite significant because it is so addictive,"" Volkow said. She credited an increase in education campaigns and an increased awareness in the health care system about the abuse for slowing the abuse of these drugs. Government drug buy-back programs have also had an impact, Volkow said. ""We still have a lot of work to do and we can still bring those numbers realistically lower,"" Volkow said. Compared to other countries, even with the decline in use, the United States still has a higher drug use rate than many other countries. ""We don't (want to) stand out as a country with high rates of drug abuse among teenagers.""","National Institute on Drug Abuse releases latest study on teen behavior .
The downward trend in abuse is now a couple of decades old .

"(CNN)Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush has decided to ""actively explore"" a presidential bid after conversations with his family over Thanksgiving, he said in a Facebook post Tuesday. While Bush had been making steps toward a presidential bid with recent speeches in early primary states and plans to release documents from his time period as governor, the timing of Tuesday's announcement was widely unexpected and will quicken the pace for some would-be Republican primary challengers. In the post, Bush writes that over the holiday he ""talked about the future of the nation"" with his family. ""As a result of these conversations and thoughtful consideration of the kind of strong leadership I think America needs, I have decided to actively explore the possibility of running for President of the United States,"" he said. Bush has been moving toward a run for months and in recent days sparked renewed speculation over his plans with a visit to the all-important early primary state of South Carolina to give a commencement speech Monday, and his comments in a Sunday interview that he felt he ""would be a good president."" RELATED: Bush to grads: 'Shake things up' Democrats scoffed at his announcement. Democratic National Committee spokesman Mo Elleithee suggested it was simply meant to draw press, but dismissed the possibility of a Bush run either way. ""I don't know what the difference is between 'thinking about' running and 'actively exploring' running, but I suspect it has a lot to do with keeping his name in the news,"" Elleithee said. ""However you see it, there's no parsing this simple fact: Jeb Bush has fully embraced the failed economic agenda that benefits only a select few at the expense of the middle class. That's not going to change no matter how many different ways he says he may run."" Bush's announcement is sure to speed up the timeline for many other potential Republican presidential contenders on whether to jump in as well. Bush is seen as a top pick for establishment Republicans hoping to encourage the party to nominate a candidate they see as most electable on the national stage. Many observers believe if Bush jumps in the race, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio — who's been mentored by Bush since his entry into Florida politics — wouldn't run. And he'd likely make it tougher for some of the more establishment-minded governors, like Texas Gov. Rick Perry or New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, to find footing in the race. However, a source near Rubio said Tuesday that while Bush's announcement changes the dynamic of the race, the junior Florida Senator is still ""on track to run for president"" in 2016. And Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, who has been actively preparing for a bid and would likely run to Bush's right flank, also seemed nonplussed by the announcement. ""I think we're a big tent -- we can use moderates, conservatives, libertarians — we need em all,"" he told reporters walking into the Capitol. Asked whether he could win the nomination, Paul demurred. ""I think the more the merrier -- the public will determine that."" Bush added in Tuesday's post that he hopes ""to visit with many of you and have a conversation about restoring the promise of America"" in the coming months. RELATED: 6 things to know about Jeb Bush . Bush also announced the creation of a PAC, which will aim to ""support leaders, ideas and policies that will expand opportunity and prosperity for all Americans."" He added that the PAC would ""facilitate conversations with citizens across America to discuss the most critical challenges facing our exceptional nation."" On Sunday, Bush also announced plans to release about 250,000 emails from his time in office and an upcoming e-book about his time as governor, moves seen as efforts to re-introduce Americans to his governing chops in preparation to emerge as a more prominent player on the national stage. If he does make his bid official, he'll likely face fierce opposition from conservatives in the primary, who have long been frustrated with his advocacy for Common Core educational standards and his support for a more moderate vision of immigration reform. RELATED: Bush releases 250,000 emails . He's previously expressed support for a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, though he's wavered in that support since. And while he's come out in opposition to President Barack Obama's executive actions on immigration, he's also urged Republicans to act on immigration reform ""rather than have their heads explode."" That moderation on immigration reform — and his diverse family, as his wife was born in Mexico and he speaks fluent Spanish — have many in the GOP hopeful Bush could help the party overcome some of their deficit with Hispanic voters, which has proven to be problematic for them in national races. Despite the likely conservative opposition, Bush has hinted he wouldn't shift to the far-right to please GOP primary voters if he runs. During the Wall Street Journal CEO Council annual meeting earlier this month, Bush warned that the GOP presidential nominee shouldn't ""lose the primary to win the general without violating your principles."" The comments came as the conservative and more centrist wings of the GOP continue to debate a path forward for the party, with many on the right arguing former GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney lost in 2012 because he didn't stand strong enough on conservative principles. But Romney and Bush, despite the conservative criticism, remain two of the most popular figures in the party, and indeed both led the recent McClatchy-Marist national poll of the potential GOP presidential field. Romney took 19 percent, while Bush came in second with 14 percent support; with Romney out of the race, Bush would lead with 16 percent support, followed by former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee with 12 percent. Dana Bash and Ted Barrett contributed to this report.","Other 2016 hopefuls maintain that Bush's announcement wouldn't prevent them from running .

"Clashes continued to rage on the sixth day of what appears to be a coordinated offensive by Syrian rebels to push a hard-line al Qaeda militia out of northern Syria. ""They're shooting back and forth,"" said Selami Yilmaz, a resident of the Turkish border town of Karkamis. Gunfire echoed over the receiver as he spoke to CNN by phone Wednesday. Yilmaz said he could see and hear fighting across the border in the nearby Syrian town of Jarablus, which has been controlled for months by the al Qaeda-linked militant group called the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, or ISIS. Jarablus is one of many towns across a swath of opposition-controlled northern Syria where rebels have attacked ISIS positions in recent days. The deadly power struggle marks a dramatic shift in the Syrian civil war, as many opposition fighters have turned from battling the forces of Syrian strongman Bashar al-Assad to attacking their own former comrades in arms. Rebel spokesmen said that ISIS's violent enforcement of a plan to establish an Islamic state in Syria had alienated other opposition groups. ""They (ISIS) have become aggressive, and they have crossed the red line from trespassing to assaults to their extremist agenda,"" said Islam Aloush, a spokesman for a rebel umbrella group that calls itself the Islamic Front. In an interview with CNN on Tuesday, Aloush said ISIS's radical interpretation of Sharia law, public executions and imprisonment of opponents were key factors that spurred the opposition to take up arms against the al Qaeda-linked group. ""ISIS cannot withstand the losses they are taking and the numbers now held as prisoners of war,"" Aloush said, saying that his organization far outnumbered ISIS. The Islamic Front boasts an estimated 40,000 fighters, making it probably the single largest rebel command, according to Aron Lund, editor of the Carnegie Endowment's Syria in Crisis website. Chaotic fighting . Fighters on both sides appear to have committed atrocities. According to the London-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, rebels summarily executed at least 34 ISIS militants near the town of Jabal al-Zawiya this week. Meanwhile, rebels posted videos and photos of the bodies of at least nine men who they said had been executed after being kidnapped by ISIS. The graphic images, which were said to be filmed in the battlefield city of Aleppo, showed the men apparently shot through the head.  Each victim's hands appeared to be bound from behind with plastic cuffs.  CNN could not verify the authenticity of the photos and video. The chaotic war within a war that erupted over the last week in northern Syria is further complicated by the fact that the anti-ISIS faction includes another militia tied to the al Qaeda terror network. Militants from the rival al Nusra Front, which follows a hardline Islamist ideology inspired by al Qaeda, have joined in the battle against ISIS in recent days. On Tuesday, Nusra's leader called for an end to the bloody infighting, which is believed to have left hundreds of people dead. In a nine-minute audio message, Abu-Mohammad al-Jolani blamed ""the incorrect policies"" of ISIS for ""aggravating the conflict"" between armed opposition factions. He proposed an immediate cease-fire and the creation of an Islamic council with representatives from all of the relevant groups.","Opposition fighters have turned from battling Syrian government to attacking former comrades .

"Pago Pago,  American Samoa (CNN) -- When an earthquake-triggered tsunami cascaded into this tiny island in late September, the result was 34 lives lost and untold millions in property damage. But a CNN investigation to air on tonight's ""AC 360"" has uncovered an array of unsettling facts that point to a single conclusion: this natural disaster was in many ways a man-made tragedy. Public records show that the Department of Homeland Security had awarded millions of federal dollars in grants for disaster preparedness here, including the construction of an island-wide siren warning system. But all the federal funding was frozen in early 2007 after DHS inspectors found that the local American Samoan government had been diverting millions of those dollars for its own uses. Birdsall Alailima, director of American Samoa's territorial office of Homeland Security from 2003 through 2007, now lives in southern Illinois, not far from St. Louis, Missouri. He showed CNN on a map exactly where on the island the sirens were to have been placed. Thirty towers in all, he said, with 30 sirens that could have been activated by the push of a single button. ""You're saying that the systems should have been in place?"" CNN correspondent Drew Griffin asked him. ""Absolutely,"" Alailima said. ""And people died as a result?"" ""Yes."" He's not the only one who thinks so. Federal sources told CNN they believe that had the warning system been built, the death toll would likely have been lower. In American Samoa, however, territorial Gov. Togiola Tulafono, told CNN that he knew of no viable plan for the siren system. ""There was a study, I believe, but never a plan for a system,"" the governor said. ""I was trying to get verification of what happened to that system, but I could not get the definite information."" Alailima said he was fired by the governor when the federal funding was frozen, and that the governor was aware of the preparations. ""I'm not going to fault them for freezing the funds,"" Tulafono said. ""These are federal funds that they have oversight responsibility for and they saw fit to freeze the funds."" The governor told CNN he had tried to correct the problem by firing his entire homeland security staff. But, he said, that failed to solve the problem. ""All I'm saying is we have tried to work with them and have tried to get partial releases (of the money), and so far that hasn't happened."" A federal official calls the governor's statement ""nonsense."" American Samoa would have access to the frozen funds if it had agreed to pay back even some of the money it misused, said the official. The government and the governor refused, and the tsunami siren system was stopped, according to the official. A spokesman for the governor's office later declined comment on the nature of the negotiations. American Samoan government officials said they purchased another warning system -- radios that would have triggered alarms across the island. But during the CNN interview, Tulafono conceded that the system ""was not in place"" when the tsunami struck. CNN has learned that the FBI is now conducting an investigation into exactly what did happen to the federal preparedness dollars sent to American Samoa. It was launched, sources tell CNN, by the Interior Department as its Insular Affairs office has federal administrative responsibility for the island. The FBI investigation is only the latest and most recent attempt by the federal government to try to track what one federal official told CNN was ""endemic"" corruption on the island. Here are only a few instances of the alleged corruption: . • Both the current Samoan lieutenant governor and a former state senator are under federal indictment on allegations of fraud, bribery and conspiracy. A trial is pending in Washington because there are no federal courts on the island. Attorneys for both men have refuted the indictment in court filings and say their clients are innocent of all the charges. • An inspector general's report by the Department of Homeland Security issued in May 2007 cites numerous examples of American Samoan officials misusing federal grant money. The report's findings include the purchase of six flat-screen televisions for more than $25,000; purchase of executive leather chairs for $4,000; spending $77,000 on equipment no auditor could find; and extensive travel and entertainment charges, including money spent in Las Vegas, Nevada, by a Samoan official for a conference he was scheduled to have attended in Colorado. • The DHS letter freezing its funding was sent on January 12, 2007. The action was taken because ""we have found that Homeland Security Grant funds have been diverted to uses by State government offices for other than the intended use of Homeland Security funds. This is not only in violation of public trust but In Lieu of agreement as well."" In the Samoan villages destroyed by the tsunami, stories of corruption are not new. ""The government here gets a lot of money from the U.S. federal government,"" Heinrich Tavai told CNN as he watched members of his Lofatonoa Pentacostal Church help in the clean up. ""Every year, they get millions and millions of dollars. As you see, we look like a Third World country when we should be looking more like a U.S. territory."" In half a dozen villages either wiped out or badly damaged by the tsunami, CNN could find no visible evidence of local government assistance. Workers from a tuna fish processing plant were helping in one village; in another, students from an island community college were dredging rubbish out of a stream. Red Cross officials distributed tents in other villages. Children in another village were hauling furniture on their backs to help clear the debris. When asked about the seeming lack of local government assistance, the governor told CNN, ""Our departments are out there working and working very hard, and to say they haven't seen any assistance is totally false."" Since 1995, American Samoa has received nearly $2 billion in federal grants from nearly every federal agency. On average the 65,000-population -- the size of a typical American suburb -- receives about $250 million in federal money each year. Congressional sources tell CNN that oversight has always been a problem because of Samoa's isolation and the expense involved in even mounting an investigation. ""They can do half a dozen investigations in Wyoming or California for the amount just one investigation would cost in Samoa,"" a source told CNN. Federal sources said they don't believe any official is getting rich off the U.S. Treasury. Instead, they said, federal funds -- including disaster-preparedness money that was to have gone to the warning system -- were instead used to create local government jobs in an economy almost totally dependent on U.S. federal grants. Moreover, the source added, each federal agency may have many employees whose jobs are to allocate federal funds, but only a relative handful whose jobs are to ""manage"" or account for that money. In an e-mail to CNN, an Interior Department spokeswoman said that in previous administrations ""there were real issues of neglect and failed oversight that must be addressed quickly, thoroughly and responsibly."" ""We will help the islands rebuild and recover,"" said Kendra Barkoff, ""but taxpayer dollars will be invested with strong oversight and full accountability.""","34 people died in last month's tsunami that smashed into American Samoa .

"Ho ho -- huh? The family of an African-American high school student in New Mexico says he's crushed after a teacher questioned why he was wearing Santa garb during a school holiday dress-up day last week, CNN affiliate KOAT reported. The teacher told Christopher Rougier, a freshman at Cleveland High School, that he couldn't be Santa because Santa is white, the student's father, Michael, told KOAT. ""He was embarrassed,"" he told the station. Now, his son doesn't want anything to do with Christmas. Michael Rougier said the teacher called his wife to apologize, but that's not enough. ""He needs to be fired,"" Rougier told KOAT. ""For him to make a comment like that, there has to be at a minimum prejudice in him, and we don't have room for that."" Kim Vesely, the director of Rio Rancho Public Schools, released a statement to media about the incident. ""This situation involves a teacher recently hired by Cleveland High who made -- and admits he made -- a stupid mistake,"" the director said. ""The remark was inappropriate and should not have been made. The teacher feels very badly about what occurred. He self-reported the incident to the principal and has apologized to the student and to the student's parent. Appropriate disciplinary action has been taken."" The boy's family has asked that he be moved out of the teacher's class, and the school has complied, Vesely said. The teacher's remark came amid something of a dust-up over Santa's skin color after Fox News Channel picked up on a Slate.com writer's piece questioning the mythical character's ethnicity. Writer Aisha Harris, who is black, wrote about growing up wondering why Santa was depicted as a white man, and argued for something less definitive: a penguin. In a widely viewed segment reacting to Harris' piece, Fox anchor Megyn Kelly said on air: ""And, by the way, for all of you kids watching at home, Santa just is white, but this person is arguing maybe we should also have a black Santa. But, you know, Santa is what he is. And so, you know, we're just debating this because someone wrote about it, kids."" Harris said Kelly's comments are part of the reason she felt the need to provoke thought about Santa's race. ""To me, (it) just spoke to the reason why I wrote the piece, is that there are a lot of people out there who automatically assume that Santa must be white and there's no way -- it's laughable that he could be anything else,"" Harris said Sunday on CNN's ""Reliable Sources."" ""The point I was trying to make was that I think that we have, the world has changed a lot over the last 50, 100 years, and Santa Claus is a fictional character,"" Harris continued. ""He is nothing like the original historical figure he was based off of anymore,"" she said. ""We've kind of evolved him into this magical mythical figure, and for kids, I think it's important that they don't have to feel necessarily bogged down that Santa is always white, and that's the way he should be."" Kelly shot back at her critics, telling them to get a sense of humor. ""Humor is what we try to bring to this show, but that's lost on the humorless,"" she said Friday on ""The Kelly File."" ""This would be funny if it were not so telling about our society, in particular, the knee-jerk instinct by so many to race-bait and to assume the worst in people, especially people employed by the very powerful Fox News Channel."" She wasn't motivated by racial fear or loathing, she said. ""In fact, it was something far less sinister: A lifetime of exposure to the very same commercials, mall casting calls, and movies Harris references in her piece."" ""We continually see St. Nick as a white man in modern-day America,"" Kelly continued. ""Should that change? Well, that debate got lost because so many couldn't get past the fact that I acknowledged, as Harris did, that the most commonly depicted image of Santa, does, in fact, have white skin."" Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, co-host of CNN's Crossfire, said a network makeup artist told him ""Santa Claus is what every child needs him to be, and the children get to decide Santa Claus, not some TV commentator."" ""I thought it was beautifully done,"" Gingrich said. Reality check . At least all adults can agree on one fact: Santa Claus isn't even real. So why the brouhaha? Bill Donohue, president of the Catholic League, said the debate is ""much ado about nothing"" because there's no doubt Santa is white. ""(St.) Nick was Greek. The last time I checked, Greeks weren't black,"" Donohue told CNN's Don Lemon on The 11th Hour. According to the St. Nicholas Center, which says it's dedicated to ""discovering the truth about Santa Claus,"" St. Nicholas was indeed Greek and lived about 1,700 years ago in an area that is now southern Turkey. But author Reza Aslan said he doesn't think many Greek people would be accurately portrayed as the ""rosy-cheeked Santa that we're all used to."" ""White has more to do with sociological, economic, cultural considerations that go far beyond just the simple color of your skin,"" Aslan told Lemon. Amy Holmes, anchor of ""The Hot List"" at TheBlaze.com, acknowledged that most depictions of Santa feature a white man. But in addition to being fictional, ""traditionally Santa has also been an obese, alcoholic elf who lives in the North Pole, who has very questionable labor practices -- not to mention animal cruelty, lashing those poor reindeer through the sky all night long."" ""This is ridiculous that we are even having this debate,"" Holmes said. ""Everyone knows that Santa is your parents. So whatever race they are is the race that Santa is.""

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- An earthquake in Pakistan, powerful enough to prompt the appearance of a small island off the coast, has killed at least 330 people, Pakistani officials said. The 7.7-magnitude quake struck Tuesday in a remote, sparsely populated area of southwestern Pakistan, but it had severe consequences. At least 330 people have lost their lives, a spokesman for the National Disaster Management Authority said Wednesday. In addition to the fatalities, 445 people were injured, he said. And more people are still feared to be trapped in wreckage. Images from the scene showed some buildings reduced to rubble. ""Still, there are some areas that are not accessible,"" a spokesman for the Red Crescent told CNN. ""So that toll can be increased,"" Khalid Bin Majeed said about the number of deaths. ""When we reach all the areas, then there will be a clear picture."" Rescue efforts are under way in the heavily hit districts of Awaran and Kech in Balochistan province. But severely damaged communications networks are hindering the operation, said Jan Muhammad Buledi, a spokesman for the provincial government. Thousands of survivors from the earthquake are facing difficulties in the two districts, he added, saying that authorities have received offers of support from Iran and Turkey. The Pakistani military has deployed more than 1,000 troops to the affected area to help with rescue and relief efforts, some of them traveling in helicopters and others in convoy on mountain roads. About 10,000 food packs have been sent to the region. Each pack can feed a family for 15 days. The troops are entering a difficult region. Militants fighting for a separate state in Balochistan operate out of part of Awaran district, which has been the site of bombings in the past. The remoteness of the area means that some of the injured are having to be airlifted to major cities such as Quetta, the capital of Balochistan, and Karachi, the capital of neighboring Sindh province. Measuring the magnitude of earthquakes . Island emerges . The quake was strong enough to cause a mass 20 to 30 feet high to emerge from the Arabian Sea like a small mountain island off the coast of Gwadar, local police official Mozzam Jah said. A large number of people gathered to view the newly formed island, he said. Large quakes can cause significant deformation to the earth's crust, particularly visible along coastlines. The island is about 100 feet in diameter and about one mile off the coast, GEO TV reported. Zahid Rafi, principal seismologist for the National Seismic Monitoring Center, confirmed the island had formed. He said it was ""not surprising,"" considering the magnitude of the earthquake. But John Bellini, a geophysicist with the U.S. Geological Survey, said that generally it would be unlikely for a large island to emerge from such a quake as Tuesday's. Many things, such as the tide, could come into play regarding the rise of the island, he said. With a depth of about nine miles (about 15 kilometers), the quake struck 43 miles (69 kilometers) northeast of Awaran and 71 miles (114 kilometers) northwest of Bela, the U.S. Geological Survey said. The tremors lasted two minutes. People flocked out onto the streets of Quetta. Aftershocks could be felt in Karachi, hundreds of miles to the southeast. CNN's Saima Mohsin and journalist Sophia Saifi reported from Pakistan. CNN's Mari Ramos and Elizabeth Joseph also contributed to this report.","NEW: The death toll could climb as authorities access hard-to-reach areas, a spokesman says .

"(CNN)Esther Vergeer was the world's invincible sporting superstar, unbeaten on the tennis court for 10 years and still at the top of her game. Then one day, while she was sitting on her sofa watching TV, she decided it was time to retire, just like that. The Dutch grande dame of wheelchair tennis ended her career in 2013 on a winning streak of 470 matches -- an achievement second only to Pakistani squash great Jahangir Khan's record mark of 555 straight victories set in the 1980s. ""That decision to walk away, to walk into a world you don't know, have no experience in, was one of the scariest times in my life,"" Vergeer told CNN's Open Court. ""Sometimes it still is scary!"" An emotion fueled moment the previous summer had acted as a catalyst for Vergeer's decision to step away from competition. After winning a seventh Paralympic gold medal at London 2012, she broke down in tears, explaining to the media huddled around her, ""There was so much pressure on me. Everybody just expects me to win gold, expects it to be easy."" A new life . After toiling and training for 20 years, she thought enough was enough. ""It was such a relief to win that medal,"" says the 33-year-old Vergeer as she reflects on her self-imposed sabbatical. ""So I decided to take a break after the Paralympic Games and I enjoyed not having to deal with the pressure anymore. ""I was at home watching the Australian Open [in 2013] and I realized I didn't miss it. I didn't want to be in Australia. I enjoyed being home so much more. I was 32 and ready to start a new life."" The transition from professional tennis player to a mere mortal was not easy for the wonder woman from Woerden. Vergeer dominated her field, winning seven Paralympic gold medals, 21 grand slam singles crowns and 169 singles titles overall, plus 159 in doubles competition. ""It's difficult to be retired and not to be an athlete anymore,"" Vergeer explains. ""There are some days that I miss it. ""Winning matches, getting applause, hanging a gold medal around your neck, I guess that is some kind of addiction, something you want to feel constantly. ""I don't have that anymore. Now in everyday life, it's not every day that people come up to me and say I'm doing great work. ""I had to get used to the fact that it's not going to be there anymore. ""As an athlete your life is also so structured; the time you get up, the time you could eat, when you could go on holiday. ""Now everything is possible and sometimes I make the mistake of planning my day too full, even after two years!"" She may be retired from the professional game but Vergeer still has a jam-packed to-do list. Top of that list is running the Esther Vergeer Foundation, which encourages children and youngsters with a physical disabilities to participate in sport. The foundation helps organize sports days in the Netherlands but is also intent on improving sporting opportunities for disabled children around the globe. ""I don't think a lot of kids with disabilities go out there and play sports,"" she says. ""That needs to be pushed and promoted. That's what I really want to do."" Vergeer's own retirement did, however, lead her to the realization that Para-Sport is now much more prominent -- and that's another positive trend she wants to nurture. ""When I announced my retirement it surprised me,"" she explains. ""It blew me away that I got so much attention from all over the world from China, to Iran, to America. ""It made me proud, it made me realize that Paralympic sport was grown and known all over the world. That was something I fought for all my life, all my career. ""When I started playing wheelchair tennis there was hardly any recognition or knowledge of Paralympic sports. ""In the last 20 years, I've seen the sport grow. I've seen it become more professional and integrated. ""There were still moments when I thought 'I'd really like to be on that TV program' but then some athlete without a disability became the first to call and sometimes that frustrated me. ""Then I realized, we need to see the growing process. I think Paralympic sport will get more attention, will become more integrated and will get more recognition from sponsors and companies in the future."" Cover story . Her peerless win-record helped Vergeer blaze a trail to promote Paralympic sport, notably when she posed nude for the cover of ESPN Magazine's ""Body Issue"" in 2010. ""Sometimes, as a disabled athlete, you must think outside the box,"" she told CNN at the time. ""I realize that doing the shoot was 'an edgy' thing to do but I didn't do the photos just to raise awareness of disabled sport. ""The aim of the magazine is to show how different types of bodies can perform well in sport and I hope that my photos will get that message across."" Vergeer is now proactively, and passionately, promoting another message -- increasing the number of integrated tennis tournaments. The Wheelchair Tennis Tour, which began in 1992, arguably already matches the demands of the WTA and ATP tennis tours, with 160 tournaments in 40 countries per season. The jewels in the crown of its tour are also the four grand slams -- the Australian Open, Roland Garros, Wimbledon and the U.S. Open -- which are staged in tandem with the prestigious able-bodied events. ""The ultimate dream I have for wheelchair tennis is that it's going to be a very integrated sport,"" says Vergeer, who is the tournament director for Februrary's ABM AMRO wheelchair tennis tournament in Rotterdam which is played alongside the elite men's event. ""Able-bodied tournaments are one of the best platforms we have to showcase what people with disabilities can do. ""To show we are just human beings with ambition and a love of competition."" Adrenaline rush . Vergeer was introduced to wheelchair tennis after she was left paralyzed following surgery to remove a clutch of blood vessels around her spinal cord when she was just eight years old. ""The moment they told me I would never be able to walk again is not the moment I remember very much,"" says Vergeer, who is paralyzed from the waist down. But her first competitive tennis match a few years later still very much lingers in the mind. ""I was so excited and nervous. It gave me goose bumps and adrenaline. I really enjoyed it. Since announcing her retirement from professional sport in February 2013, it is basketball -- a sport she gave up when she decided to combine tennis with her university studies in management, economics and law -- which has provided her with a regular dose of sporting adrenaline. ""I have to admit that I'm playing basketball now,"" Vergeer smiles. ""I'm really enjoying being in a team and playing in competitions."" But inside the confines of the Center Point sports complex in Almere, just outside Amsterdam, the former tennis ace was persuaded to pick up a tennis racquet for the first time in 18 months for CNN's Open Court. The emotions and muscle memories stirred for Vergeer may have revealed more than a recently retired tennis pro might have wished. ""I haven't played tennis for a while now after my retirement and I noticed that coming back to the court makes me feel free somehow,"" she explains. ""I feel strong, I feel fast. I feel in control, I love that! Now I realize a year and a half not playing tennis is too long. ""I think I'm going to go out on court more often."" Could 'Vergeer the Invincible' consider making a comeback in time for the 2016 Paralympic Games in Rio? The Dutch ace is keeping her counsel for now but perhaps we shouldn't bet against 470 straight victories and counting.","Esther Vergeer has a winning streak of 470 matches - the most set ever by a female athlete .

"Washington (CNN)Florida Sen. Marco Rubio is on track to run for President in 2016 even if Jeb Bush also jumps into the race, a source close to Rubio says. The source told CNN that a Bush candidacy -- increasingly likely after the former Florida governor said in a Facebook post Tuesday that he will ""actively explore"" running -- changes the dynamics of the race ""but not Marco's thought process."" Rubio has invited supporters to a Jan. 23-24 retreat in Miami Beach, where his top aides and donors could formalize his plans for 2016. A run for president would be a big risk for Rubio, a 43-year-old former Florida House speaker who looks like a sure bet to win a second term in the Senate in 2016. He's making the moves of a presidential contender. Rubio campaigned with GOP candidates in the 2014 midterm election. He has a memoir set for release in January. And he's working with incoming House Ways and Means Chairman Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) to craft health care legislation meant to be an alternative to Obamacare. He's also been increasingly vocal on foreign policy issues -- potentially setting up a clash with leading Republican contenders like Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, who has called for less U.S. intervention overseas. Rubio, though, would share one problem with Bush: He's championed an overhaul of U.S. immigration laws, a position that has fallen out of favor with much of the GOP base.","A source close to Sen.

"(CNN)In 2013, people just wanted to know how to twerk. It was a more innocent time. This year, people wanted to know if they had Ebola. Google has released its annual round-up of the year's top global searches. Apple, Facebook and other companies also do these recaps, but those only show what we bought or posted publicly on social media. Our search history is a more honest, sometimes embarrassing, peek into what we really care about. In 2014, the entire world was sad about the passing of Robin Williams, excited to watch the World Cup and worried about Ebola. Those three topics top the list of global trending searches, which also includes missing Malaysian Airlines Flight 370, the viral phenomenon Ice Bucket Challenge, addictive smartphone game Flappy Bird and Eurovision winner and drag queen Conchita Wurst. Celebrity deaths tend to dominate Google's year-end lists. Last year Paul Walker was the top trending topic after dying in a car accident, and Nelson Mandela and ""Glee"" actor Cory Monteith were in the top five. Google breaks out a special, sad category of ""trending celebrity losses"" to show the deceased celebrities we searched for most. Following Williams on this year's list were Joan Rivers, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Maya Angelou and Jan Hooks. Most popular global searches for living people were Jennifer Lawrence and Kim Kardashian. French actress Julie Gayet was third on the list, likely because of allegations that she had an affair with French President Francois Hollande. Tracy Morgan's tragic car accident and Renee Zellweger's new look also stoked our curiosity. In the United States, domestic abuse made NFL's Ray Rice a top searched for person, and NASCAR driver Tony Stewart was a top topic after he struck and killed fellow driver Kevin Ward Jr. during a race. Google is a first stop for questions people may be to embarrassed to ask their friends. This year's top ""What is..."" queries included Ebola, ALS, ISIS, Bitcoin and asphyxia. Apple's Airdrop feature, which lets you share files between Apple devices, was either very popular or very confusing. It made the list of top ""What is..."" searches and was the top trending ""How to..."" search for the year. After sharing files, we just wanted to know how to contour with makeup, vote, kiss and craft. Google is a popular first stop for looking up various health symptoms. Ebola was the top term here too, but it wasn't the only ailment we thought we might have in 2014. The top searches for symptoms also included the flu, pregnancy, Aspergers, and spurred on by the Ice Bucket Challenge, ALS. Like hypochondriacs, dog owners also take to Google in large numbers.

"It was the bomb credited with ending World War II. Days after the United States dropped atomic bombs on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945, Japan announced its unconditional surrender. In Hiroshima, 80,000 people died instantly when the bomb was dropped on August 6, 1945, and another 112,000 died in the aftermath. More than 70,000 people died instantly when the second bomb was dropped on August 9 in Nagasaki. The Manhattan Project, the federal military program where leading scientists developed the atomic bomb in secret, could become a national historic park with the help of recently passed congressional legislation. The National Defense Authorization Act includes seven new national park sites, the expansion of nine national park sites and the extension of 15 National Heritage Areas. The legislation awaits President Barack Obama's signature. ""Our national parks are a reflection of our nation, both past and present, and these seven new national park sites will further tell America's stories,"" said Clark Bunting, president and CEO of the National Parks Conservation Association. ""Bipartisan, congressional approval for protecting and preserving Harriet Tubman's heroic life and work, Columbian mammoths and Ice Age fossils at Tule Springs, and the complexity of the Manhattan Project continue to make our National Park System our country's best idea,"" he said. Here are some potential new and expanded park sites worth exploring. Manhattan Project National Historical Park . Working in secret during World War II, scientists J. Robert Oppenheimer, Maria Goeppert Mayer and others led thousands of workers in Los Alamos, New Mexico; Oak Ridge, Tennessee; and Hanford, Washington, to build a nuclear reactor and assemble the atomic bomb. The legislation authorizes the proposed park, which would be located in all three states. Its creation is dependent on land acquisition. While the National Park Service will interpret the sites for the public, the U.S. Department of Energy is responsible for ensuring safety, environmental remediation and historic preservation of its Manhattan Project properties, and access to the properties. Harriet Tubman National Historical Park . Born into slavery in Maryland, Harriet Tubman escaped to Philadelphia and rose to become an iconic conductor on the Underground Railroad, returning again and again to Maryland to help enslaved people escape to freedom. After the Civil War, she fought for women's suffrage along with Susan B. Anthony in Auburn, New York. The proposed national historical park, whose creation is also dependent on land acquisition, would include the existing Harriet Tubman National Monument on Maryland's Eastern Shore and add new sites in New York. Tule Springs Fossil Beds National Monument . Once home to bison herds, prides of lions, Columbian mammoths, saber tooth cats, herds of bison and other Ice Age animals, Nevada's Tule Springs desert used to be lush wetlands. The evidence of its past is ripe for further exploration if the area becomes a new national park site as the Tule Springs Fossil Beds National Monument. Valles Caldera National Preserve . The Valles Caldera National Preserve in New Mexico is ""one of the world's best examples of a resurgent caldera and its large eruptions,"" says the National Parks Conservation Association. Calderas are vast sunken areas formed after supervolcano eruptions blow out the ground and the land falls back to rest. (Yellowstone may be the world's most famous supervolcano.) Visitors can also enjoy exploring the mountains, old growth timber and Native American heritage in the area. The site is already owned by the federal government, and it would get even more attention as a new national park site. Gettysburg National Military Park . The Gettysburg Train Station, where President Abraham Lincoln arrived on a train to deliver the historic Gettysburg Address, would be added to the existing Gettysburg National Military Park. The train station also served as a field hospital during the Battle of Gettysburg. The Gettysburg Foundation owns the land, and there are plans to donate it to the National Park Service.","Manhattan Project may become new national park site .
There are seven new sites included in Congressional legislation .

"In Mississippi, you will never be denied a colossal soda or huge restaurant portion because of a city ordinance. Gov. Phil Bryant signed a law preventing counties, districts and towns from enacting rules that limit portion sizes. It follows New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg's attempt to ban the sale of large, sugary drinks in the city -- a move that fizzled when a judge blocked the effort. The Mississippi measure was dubbed the ""Anti-Bloomberg"" bill. The new law says only the state legislature has the authority to regulate the sale and marketing of food on a statewide basis. ""It simply is not the role of the government to micro-regulate citizens' dietary decisions,"" the governor wrote about his decision. """"The responsibility for one's personal health depends on individual choices about a proper diet and appropriate exercise."" Mississippi has the nation's highest rate of obesity, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. About 34.9% of the state's adult population was obese in 2011, the report said. But Bryant said recent studies show that obesity among Mississippi elementary students has dropped 13.3% between 2005 and 2011. ""We believe there's enough regulation,"" said Mississippi state Sen. Tony Smith, the bill's author and a restaurant owner. ""If the market demands that I serve a more healthy food, I'll do that to meet to the market demand,"" he said. ""But ... why should I risk my capital, my hard work, my efforts that I've put in to build a restaurant on the thinking of what a government official thinks?"" ""It doesn't prevent local government from promoting healthy foods,"" said Mike Cashion, executive director of the Mississippi Hospitality and Restaurant Association, which lobbied for the legislation.. ""What it does do is prevent them from creating policy mandates for the sake of consistency and uniformity.""","Cities can't limit food or drink portions at restaurants .

"Jeb Bush says he has ""no problems"" pushing policies in a 2016 Republican presidential primary that would allow more legal immigrants. The former Florida governor discussed his position Tuesday on what could be a key issue for conservative voters in a brief interview with NBC's Miami affiliate, just hours after announcing on social media that he will ""actively explore"" a run for the White House. ""You've gotta protect the borders, enforce the law, be respectful of the rule of law, and at the same time, be able to encourage young, aspirational people to come to our country. It's a win-win,"" Bush said. ""I have no problems advancing that idea."" Asked whether much of the GOP's conservative base disagrees with Bush's position, he responded: ""Well, we'll see. If I run, we'll see."" Bush offered no more details on his timeline for a decision, saying that will come ""at the proper time."" He said he plans to ""listen to people and see if my message can resonate, and that will be beginning next year."" Bush isn't the only Republican to call for some expansions of U.S. immigration policies. Incoming Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said this month that the United States needs more H1-B visas, which allow companies to bring skilled workers into the country. But calling for expanded immigration is problematic for many conservatives after a summer of reports of an influx of minors across the U.S.-Mexico border, and after President Barack Obama's November decision to halt deportations for millions of undocumented parents of U.S. citizens. Bush blasted Obama's immigration move last month, tweeting that it is an ""abuse of power"" and going to Facebook to say his ""ill-advised unilateral action on illegal immigration undermines all efforts to forge a permanent solution to this crisis. Action must come in the form of bipartisan comprehensive reform passed through Congress."" RELATED: Potential Bush bid sways none in GOP field . Those comments could put Bush uncomfortably at odds with similar moves -- though smaller in scope -- by both his father, George H.W. Bush, whose ""Family Fairness"" policy allowed 1.5 million relatives of newly legalized immigrants to avoid deportation while pursuing legal status, and his brother, George W. Bush, who protected 150,000 Salvadorans from deportation in 2001. The issue blew up on another candidate, Texas Gov. Rick Perry, during his 2012 run for the White House. Defending a Texas law granting in-state tuition to undocumented immigrants, Perry said: ""If you say that we should not educate children who have come into our state for no other reason than they've been brought there by no fault of their own, I don't think you have a heart."" He was eviscerated by the right, where many conservatives called his position an endorsement of amnesty. It was among several issues that ultimately sank Perry's candidacy. Another potential 2016 Republican candidate, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, could have problems with immigration, as well, after his push for comprehensive legislation drew conservatives' ire.

"The parents of Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl want the world to know they're beyond grateful their son has been released from Afghanistan after five years in captivity, but the battle is far from over. ""The recovery and reintegration of Bowe Bergdahl is a work in progress,"" Bob Bergdahl told reporters Sunday in Boise, Idaho, just one day after his son was set free. ""It isn't over for us. In many ways. It's just beginning for Jani, and I, and our family. There's a long process here,"" he said, referring to his wife, Bowe's mother. Both parents addressed their son, telling him how proud they are of him. They have not yet spoken to him directly. ""There's a reason for that, and that's because Bowe has been gone so long that it's going to be very difficult to come back,"" said Bob Bergdahl. He compared his son's situation to that of a diver going deep on a dive: ""If he comes up too fast, it could kill him."" Bergdahl is hospitalized in Germany, where his mother said there is a team of people in place to assist him. ""Trust them. It's OK, and give yourself all of the time you need to recover and decompress,"" Jani Bergdahl said to her son. ""There is no hurry. You have your life ahead of you."" She continued: ""You've made it ... You are free."" Worsening health . Bergdahl, the last American soldier held captive from the Iraq and Afghanistan conflicts, is on a long journey home after being freed in exchange for five Taliban detainees who had been held at the U.S. military prison in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Believing that his health was deteriorating, the United States acted quickly to save his life after years of work to free him from being a prisoner of war, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said Sunday. ""It was our judgment that if we could find an opening and move very quickly with that opening, that we needed to get him out of there essentially to save his life,"" Hagel said. ""I know President Obama feels very strongly about that, I do as well."" Bergdahl arrived Sunday morning at Landstuhl Regional Medical Center in Germany, a U.S. Defense official said. There was no word on Bergdahl's condition. He was last seen in a video obtained by the U.S. military in January and appeared in diminished health. National Security Adviser Susan Rice said Sunday that the move to free him came after the United States learned his health was deteriorating in captivity. ""He had lost ... a good bit of weight.  And we were very concerned that time was not ... something we could play with, that we needed to act when we had the opportunity,"" Rice told CNN's ""State of the Union With Candy Crowley."" Bergdahl's father told reporters his son had ""passed through all the checkpoints with flying colors."" Hometown celebrates . On Sunday, people in Bergdahl's hometown of Hailey, Idaho, cheered the news and looked forward to the day he might return. Yellow ribbons were tied on trees in his honor. ""I think as a community we had our ups and downs, as did the rest of the country. There were times where we wondered, but Jani and Bob Bergdahl never once gave up faith that their son was coming home to them,"" said Stefanie O'Neill, a family friend. ""They knew. It was never if Bowe comes home -- it was when Bowe comes home,"" she said. Five years detained and many questions remain . U.S. special operations forces recovered Bergdahl without incident early Saturday local time at a pickup point in eastern Afghanistan, near the border with Pakistan, a senior Department of Defense official told CNN. American officials said the government of Qatar brokered the deal. The 28-year-old Bergdahl spent five years in the hands of Afghan militants. Questions surround just how and why he disappeared. In addition to undergoing medical treatment, he is expected to be debriefed at Landstuhl. A reporter asked Hagel Sunday whether Bergdahl had left his post without permission or deserted -- and, if so, whether he would be punished. The defense secretary didn't answer directly. ""Our first priority is assuring his well-being and his health and getting him reunited with his family,"" Hagel said. ""Other circumstances that may develop and questions, those will be dealt with later."" A senior Defense official said Bergdahl's ""reintegration process"" will include ""time for him to tell his story, decompress, and to reconnect with his family through telephone calls and video conferences."" Bergdahl will likely go to Brooke Army Medical Center in San Antonio after he leaves Landstuhl. It's unclear whether his parents will see him first in Germany or Texas, a Defense official said. 'He was never forgotten' Obama, flanked by Bergdahl's parents at the White House on Saturday, praised the diplomatic officials and troops who helped secure Bergdahl's release. ""While Bowe was gone, he was never forgotten,"" the President said. His father spoke a few phrases in Pashtun, saying that his son is having trouble speaking English after his captivity in Afghanistan, according to a military press service. ""The complicated nature of this recovery will never really be comprehended,"" his father said. A senior Defense official confirmed Bowe Bergdahl is having trouble speaking English but the reasons for that were not clear, given the trauma he's been through. 'Our only son' The U.S. government secured Bergdahl's freedom in exchange for the release to the Taliban of five of its members detained at Guantanamo Bay. Bergdahl's parents issued a statement thanking the Emir of Qatar, the U.S. government and the former captive's supporters. ""We were so joyful and relieved when President Obama called us today to give us the news that Bowe is finally coming home! We cannot wait to wrap our arms around our only son."" After Bergdahl was handed over, a series of secret procedures was set in motion so each side knew the other was living up to the bargain. Qatari officials were already at Guantanamo and took custody of the detainees. A U.S. Air Force aircraft carrying them left the U.S. Navy base in Cuba on Saturday afternoon, a senior Defense official told CNN. The United States has ""appropriate assurances"" that Qatar will be able to secure the detainees there, where they are under a travel ban for a year. The leader of the Afghan Taliban, Mullah Omar, praised the release of the detainees in a rare public statement Sunday. ""Thanks to God that as a result of the Taliban's sacrifice and the Taliban's political office's nonstop efforts, five important members of Taliban are released from Gitmo prison,"" the statement said. The operation was so secretive that Afghan President Hamid Karzai was left out of the loop. ""Secretary (of State John) Kerry did inform President Karzai after the fact,"" Hagel said. Hagel was asked if this prisoner exchange could lead to more breakthroughs with the Taliban. Getting Bergdahl out of captivity was the first concern, he said. ""Whether that could lead to possible new breakthroughs with the Taliban, I don't know. Hopefully it might,"" he said. ""But we pursued this effort specifically to get Sgt. Bergdahl back."" Held by warlord . Bergdahl was deployed to Afghanistan in May 2009. He was 23 and a private at the time of his capture, which happened after he finished a guard shift at a combat outpost on June 30, 2009, in Paktika province. He was believed to be held by operatives from the Haqqani network, an insurgent force led by warlord Siraj Haqqani, who has a reputation for holding positions that are extreme even by Taliban standards. The network is affiliated with the Taliban and al Qaeda, and it was not always clear whether Haqqani operatives would abide by any agreement among the United States, Qatar and the Taliban. An Afghan Taliban commander not authorized to speak to the media confirmed to CNN that Bergdahl was captured by insurgents with links to the Haqqani network in Pakistan. Over the years, the captive was transferred back and forth between Afghanistan and Pakistan. Fast Facts: Bowe Bergdahl . Critics question the negotiations . The United States has long declared that it won't negotiate with groups linked to terrorists, but analysts have said the United States has effectively maneuvered around the edges of that declaration over the years. ""As the administration has repeatedly affirmed, we will not transfer any detainee from Guantanamo unless the threat the detainee may pose to the United States can be sufficiently mitigated and only when consistent with our humane treatment policy,"" a senior administration official told CNN, adding that the detainees will be ""subject to restrictions on their movement and activities."" Many of the released Guantanamo detainees held political positions in the Taliban government that fell in Operation Enduring Freedom in 2001. But Sen. John McCain, a former POW, called the released detainees ""hardened terrorists who have the blood of Americans and countless Afghans on their hands."" He demanded to know exactly what steps are being taken to guarantee that they never fight against the United States again. Rice told CNN the Qatari government gave Washington assurance that the risk to the United States would be mitigated. ""They enabled us to have confidence that these prisoners will be carefully watched, that their ability to move will be constrained,"" she said. Other members of Congress have complained about being cut out of the loop. Rep. Buck McKeon, chairman of the Armed Services Committee, said he still has not been briefed by administration officials on the swap. The California Republican plans to hold hearings about the Bergdahl exchange, he told CNN Chief Congressional Correspondent Dana Bash on Sunday. ""We're getting our information -- other than a very brief notification -- we're getting most of our information now from the media,"" he said in an exclusive interview on ""Newsroom."" McKeon said his staff was notified by the Defense Department Saturday after the exchange took place, but he pointed to a law that requires the administration to notify Congress 30 days before detainees are released from the facilities at Guantanamo Bay. Rice said Sunday that the ""acute urgency"" of Bergdahl's declining health justified the administration's decision to execute the swap without telling Congress. ""It was determined that it was necessary and appropriate not to adhere to the 30-day notification requirement, because it would have potentially meant that the opportunity to get Sgt. Bergdahl would have been lost,"" she said. Susan Rice responds to political debate over negotiations .","""You've made it ... You are free,"" Bowe Bergdahl's mother tells her son .

"(CNN)The 2016 presidential race isn't an abstract parlor game anymore. With a seven-paragraph Facebook post on Tuesday, Jeb Bush instantly transformed the nascent campaign. His decision to ""actively explore"" a presidential bid accelerates the scramble for donors. It also gives the former Florida governor time to figure out how to overcome suspicion in the Republican base while positioning himself as the establishment candidate in a fragmented field. The pre-holiday timing of the announcement was a big surprise to many beyond Bush's tight inner circle. Most of the political spotlight has been on Hillary Clinton this year, leaving GOP donors to sit back, hedge their bets and watch the field develop. But Bush's decision to make a move now -- 13 months ahead of the Iowa caucus -- speaks to the complicated political decisions facing potential 2016 GOP candidates. They can maintain the coy stance of insisting they haven't made a decision on running,  wait out the calendar and hopefully avoid a long, bruising primary like the one that left Mitt Romney damaged in 2012. Or they can start the work now to capture the staff and donors that can take on the Clinton machine. Bush chose option B. After all, many GOP donors and operatives, who have serious doubts about much of the field but remain uneasy about the prospect of a bruising primary, have been waiting for a clear signal from either Bush or Romney, who is being pressured by many of his longtime supporters to make a third presidential run. Bush, until recently, seemed unsure about confronting the rigors of a race. Charlie Black, who chaired Sen. John McCain's 2008 presidential run, said that prompted his potential opponents who were jockeying for establishment-minded donors to raise doubts about his interest in the race -- doubts that seemed to motivate Bush to plant a flag. ""Some of the other candidates out there have been competing for some of those dollars and some of those donors — and some of them have been implying here and there that Jeb wasn't interested,"" he said. Now Bush has signaled he's serious and can begin to lock down commitments from those donors — making it a tougher race for many of his opponents. Bush ""froze the donor sector of the hidden primary,"" said Florida-based Republican strategist Rick Wilson, noting that by stepping one foot into the race so early Bush has created a far steeper climb for New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie. ""All those Wall Street donor types who absolutely loved Chris Christie a year and a half ago, and cooled off to him a year ago, are now not returning his phone calls. He's undisciplined. They kept seeing it over and over again."" There are grave concerns within the Republican Party about whether Christie can recover from the George Washington Bridge scandal and whether voters will appreciate his bravado. Centrist Republicans view Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul with skepticism, despite his grassroots base and determined drift toward more palatable positions on foreign policy. While Texas Gov. Rick Perry appears to be making all the right moves -- enlisting tutors and meeting with activists—he has yet to convince the party faithful that he can pick up the pieces from his disastrous 2012 run. Other potential candidates like Florida Sen. Marco Rubio have intrigued Republican voters, but still have a long way to go before demonstrating they can command the field. Al Cardenas, a close Bush family ally and GOP lobbyist, said he doesn't believe Romney will run if Bush becomes the clear frontrunner in the race. ""I've spoken with Mitt Romney, who I consider to be a great friend and a great leader, about 2016, and I've always been under the assumption if people he trusts like Jeb Bush decide to run that he would not decide to do that,"" he said. WATCH: Bush 45? But other operatives close to Romney said Tuesday they did not think Bush's decision would foreclose a Romney run. That could create a situation where donors remain on the sidelines well into the spring to avoid choosing sides. Though the two men have expressed mutual admiration for one another, they are not close. By announcing the formation of a leadership PAC and signaling his intentions so early, Bush at once acknowledged his considerable advantages and vulnerabilities -- including his positions on immigration and education reforms -- as he mulls a final decision. He comes to the race with a committed core of donors, who date back to his father and brother's bids for the White House, and his allies have been building the Bush 2016 finance team now for several months. Bush's establishment of a leadership PAC — a step that falls well short of a formal exploratory committee — will also allow him to travel freely to early primary states to test the length of his brother's shadow on his potential presidential campaign. Fatigue from the Bush years, stemming from the expansion of federal spending and the U.S. military entanglements in Iraq and Afghanistan, was a huge drag on Republicans in 2006 and 2008. But George W. Bush's favorability ratings have rebounded since they hit their low of 32% in April 2008, according to polling by Gallup. Earlier this year, a Gallup survey showed that 53% of American voters now view George W. Bush favorably. Former President George H.W. Bush's approval ratings in that survey—63%— were just a point shy of the high marks given to former President Bill Clinton. Still some Republicans did not mince words on Tuesday about the drawbacks of the Bush name. ""I can't see the country electing another Bush,"" Sen Tom Coburn told reporters off the Senate floor. ""I love Jeb Bush — I think he's a nice guy.  I just can't see it."" ""There are still hard feeling about George W.,"" Coburn continued. ""So you start out with a negative - (because) you've got the wrong last name.  If he didn't have that last name he'd be a pretty good candidate."" Still, there is a large cadre of former Bush donors who backed Romney in 2012, and the former Florida Governor now can test their willingness to come back into the fold -- even as a Romney run hangs as a possibility. Of equal importance, Bush now has a long lead time to confront the most formidable challenge facing his bid: winning over core Republican activists in the early states of Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina who vehemently disagree with his moderate stance on immigration reform and his support for Common Core educational standards. He signaled his strategy on that front -- and the fact that he will not be cowed by activists hostile to his bid -- during a Wall Street Journal CEO Council meeting earlier this month when he said the GOP presidential nominee shouldn't violate their principles to win the primary. By giving himself a year to begin the courtship of activists in Iowa, New Hampshire and other early states, former New Hampshire GOP committeeman Tom Rath said, Bush ""is taking these issues on and letting them play out -- and they typically lose a lot of their punch when they are played out and discussed over time... This gives a lot of time to let the air go out of some of those balloons."" ""If you look at the race basically as geography, he defines a very important part of that geography: the center-right governing conservative spot on the map,"" added Rath, who supported Romney in 2008 and 2012, ""and that typically is the person that we nominate."" Longtime Iowa political observer Craig Robinson, said Bush's announcement caught many Republican activists in Iowa off guard because he has spent so little time there, but it was viewed Tuesday as a wise move. ""He needs a longer period of time to communicate to people where he is on education. He's going to have to explain what he wants to happen on immigration,"" said Robinson, former political director of the Iowa GOP and editor of the Iowa Republican, a website. ""There's really only one spot for an establishment candidate in Iowa.... And it's as wide open as it's ever been."" Kevin Madden, a Republican strategist, noted that Bush's early decision will allow him to lock down staff with expertise in those key states, who can begin the easing the concerns of activists in earnest -- highlighting his conservative record as governor of Florida and tackling questions about his current positioning on education and immigration. ""Every single candidate has an 'oppo' book with their name on the front cover,"" Madden said. ""The difference between those candidates winning and losing is the team you put together and the strategy that you execute to overcome many of those vulnerabilities and put yourself in a position to win."" New Hampshire Senator Kelly Ayotte hinted at the difficulty of that spade work ahead for Bush and all of the 2016 candidates in an interview Tuesday. ""He hasn't really been to New Hampshire yet,"" she said when asked about Bush's announcement. ""I don't care who you are, you have to do the hard work in New Hampshire.... Obviously, coming into it with the Bush name, he'll have name recognition. But I think everyone will get an open vetting in New Hampshire."" CNN's Chris Moody, Deirdre Walsh and Ted Barrett contributed to this report.","With early announcement, Bush sets his mark on money and activists .

"Katrina Dawson was having a Monday morning coffee with a colleague at the cafe down the street from their law firm's office when the nightmare began. The 38-year-old mother of three was among 17 people taken hostage by a gun-wielding man with extremist Muslim views who seized control of the Lindt Chocolate Cafe in the heart of Sydney's central business district. The siege last around 16 hours before police stormed the cafe in the middle of the night. The gunman was killed, but so were Dawson and another hostage, Tori Johnson, the manager of the cafe. After the two victims' identities were revealed Tuesday morning, tributes began to pour in. ""These were decent, good people who were going about their ordinary lives,"" Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott said. ""It's about as innocent a thing as anyone can do -- to go and grab a cup of coffee before the working day has fully started."" What we know, what we don't know . Tori Johnson: 'Our beautiful boy' ""We are so proud of our beautiful boy Tori, gone from this earth but forever in our memories as the most amazing life partner, son and brother we could ever wish for,"" Johnson's family said in a statement. The 34-year-old had worked for Lindt for more than two years, the company said. ""He was a great ambassador for our company and the store that he managed, which he cared about passionately,"" said Lindt Chief Executive Stephen Loane. ""He was a dedicated professional who always built a great rapport with his customers and was much loved by the Lindt team."" Johnson was reportedly killed as he tried to wrestle the gun away from the hostage taker, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) reported, citing unidentified sources. Police haven't confirmed that account. ""He was an amazing person, a selfless person, a person who always put other people before himself,"" said Peter Manettas, Johnson's former boss at the Adria Rybar & Grill in Sydney, where he worked for several years before the Lindt cafe. Manettas told The Daily Telegraph that ""family was everything to him and not a single day would go by when he wouldn't talk about them."" Katrina Dawson: 'One of our best and brightest' Dawson's death has shaken the legal community in Sydney. ""Katrina was one of our best and brightest barristers who will be greatly missed by her colleagues and friends at the NSW Bar,"" said Jane Needham, the president of the New South Wales Bar Association. ""She was a devoted mother of three children, and a valued member of her floor and of our bar community."" Dawson worked for the firm Eight Selborne Chambers, whose offices are about 70 meters from the Lindt cafe. ""A morning coffee at the Lindt Cafe was part of her daily routine,"" reported The Australian, a daily newspaper. On Monday, she was there with a pregnant colleague, the newspaper said. Dawson was trying to protect her colleague when she was killed, The Courier Mail reported without saying where it got the information. Police said two pregnant women held hostage by the gunman were hospitalized after the siege and are in stable condition. Dawson's three children -- two girls and a boy -- are aged 8, 5 and 3, local media reported. A high-flying student who graduated of the University of New South Wales, Dawson specialized in commercial, bankruptcy and competition law. Her brother and husband are also lawyers. She is the daughter of a prominent businessman, Alexander ""Sandy"" Dawson, the former chief executive of the food company Arnott's, and the sculptor Jane Dawson, the Sydney Morning Herald reported.","Tori Johnson, the manager of the store, was reportedly killed trying to tackle the gunman .

"Mention Nepal and most people think snow-capped scenes, of 7,000-meter mountains and the climbers raring to conquer them. Is there much to the country beyond its mighty Himalayan peaks? Yes. Thankfully, for those who don't consider it a vacation to hike for days, eat out of tins and do their business in a hole in the ground, it's possible to ""do"" Nepal without scaling anything. Here are six ways to experience mountain country minus the mountain climbing. In search of the inner Buddha . Who knew a hum could be so infectious? The ubiquitous Buddhist mantra of ""Om Mani Padme Hum"" fills every monastery, shop and establishment in Nepal. For embracing the spirituality that's woven into this little mountain nation, Boudhanath -- Kathmandu's thriving Buddhist enclave and a UNESCO World Heritage site -- is a good place to start. The circular complex pulsates with the energy of chanting monks and Buddhist devotees. It might be a peaceful place of worship, but it's a riot of color. The ivory and yellow stupa in the center is wreathed in rainbow-hued prayer flags. Maroon-clad monks walk clockwise around the stupa, turning prayer wheels with their right hand, and lighting lamps. Anyone can join in, provided they remember to walk clockwise. Scattered along the back alleys in radial, unnamed roads, other smaller, incense-filled monasteries such as the Jamchen Lhakhang and Shechen Monastery are pockets of calm. In the large courtyard of Shechen, young monks in training sit with their books and smartphones, eager to take photos with visitors. In a ring around the stupa, little shops are crammed with singing bowls and thangka religious paintings. Rooftop restaurants like Cafe du Temple or Stupa View offers great view of the stupa. An hour's bus ride away from Kathmandu, visitors can spend a weekend at the guesthouse adjacent to Neydo Tashi Choeling Monastery to immerse themselves in Tibetan Buddhism, meditate in the Himalayas and find out what it's like to live with 200 monks. The money from paying guests helps fund the monastery. Neydo Tashi Choeling Monastery Guest House, Pharping, Kathmandu; +977 1 692 4606; double bed from $70 per night .

""Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy"" author Douglas Adams probably never dreamed his influence would be felt 2,200 meters up a Himalayan mountain in Nepal. In Nagarkot -- a village 30 kilometers from Kathmandu that sits quietly above the clouds -- the Hotel at the End of the Universe sits atop its own mountain with 180-degree views of terraced farms and the 7,000-meter peaks of the Annapurna and Langtang ranges. ""The name is inspired by ['Hitchhikers' sequel] 'Restaurant at the End of the Universe',"" says the splendidly monikered Oasis Bhaju, who's been running the place for the past 18 years. ""The hippies were here many years ago,"" says Bhaju. ""Someone suggested this name to my father saying it would bring him good luck. I think people like it because it reminds them of Douglas Adams' book."" There's more than just the familiar name. On a clear day, the hotel offers a majestic view of the sunrise over Mount Everest. Low-roofed wooden rooms look out on hazy blue mountains poking up through the mist: the Ganesh Himal and Manasulu, to name a few. In the evening, over a Khukri rum or two with the super friendly hotel staff, guests can sometimes jam with them on their didgeridoos and djembes. Hotel at the End of the Universe, near Mahankal Temple, Nagarkot: +977 1 622 6500; standard room from $24 per night . Drink like a local . Nepalis like their booze, and they like it strong. While the words ""khukri"" (the curved Nepalese dagger) and ""gorkha"" (named for the fierce soldiers) may conjure images of fierce soldiers brandishing razor-edge machetes, in Nepal they hold the promise of a good time. Gorkha also gives its name to a bitter and heavy brand of Nepalese beer. Khukri is the local dark rum. Neither are for the easily intoxicated. Everest, a milder local brand of beer, goes down easier. One of the best places to rock out with the locals is at Purple Haze in Kathmandu's tourist-filled Thamel district. Most nights see a band belting out Hendrix and Led Zep covers to a dance floor rammed with locals letting their hair down. Khukri-induced courage might be needed to bust out some smooth moves among the expat and local crowd at Tuesday salsa nights at Tamarind in southern Kathmandu's Lalitpur district.

Visitors may weary of them while in Nepal, but are sure to miss them when they leave. So how to cure those post-travel momo cravings? Social Tours offers momo-making lessons at a produce market close to its Thamel kitchen. The market is a good place to stock up on ingredients including flour for the dough, veggies or chicken, but it's also a great place to see everyday Nepali life. ""Classes usually last two to three hours, but it really depends on the clients' speed,"" says Anura Rai, local trips consultant at Social Tours. Local women teach students how to make dough from scratch, get the proportions right, fold the dumplings into little bite-sized pockets and then whip up mean peanut and chili sauces to service with them. ""Folding is quite difficult, clients take time to learn,"" says Anura. ""It's an art and we teach them how to do it."" Travelers choose what to pay depending on the experience they've had.

A paradise for history and architecture buffs, centuries-old traditional buildings dominate the durbar squares -- the plazas that form the ancient centers of Kathmandu. Patan, Kathmandu and Bhaktapur Durbar Squares, all listed as UNESCO World Heritage Sites, echo a slower time, with old men in traditional caps playing cards on wood and brick plinths. The 17th-century Royal Palace stands on Patan Durbar Square. Its three courtyards, Sundari Chowk, Mul Chowk and Mani Keshav Narayan Chowk, were once home to Malla Dynasty kings. Scattered around it are temples. Some, like the pagoda-style Golden Temple, the shikhara-style Krishna temple with 21 gold pinnacles and the Kumbheshwar Temple with its five-tier roof, date from the 12th century. Often, a Nepali wedding takes place amid the crowds. The Kumari -- a young girl given worshipped as an incarnation of the Hindu goddess, Taleju, for the duration of her childhood -- sometimes makes an appearance at the Durbar Square's Kumari Chowk, where she lives. Enjoy cafe culture . It's been pulling in an eclectic range of global visitors since the days when it was established as a way station on the hippie trail, so it shouldn't be a surprise that Nepal has a burgeoning international food scene. Wafer-thin wood fired pizzas and tangy flavors from the Middle East are as easy to come by as local dal bhat (rice and lentils) and momos. Dhokaima in Lalitpur is a favorite with travelers for its leafy garden setting. The house special is the Nepali lamb kebab thali -- meat cooked slowly until falling off the bone, served with rice and veggies. The dish is best with a Coffee Puff, a concoction of rum and Kahlua. At New Orleans Cafe in Jhamsikhel, jazz comes with an American-style breakfast.

"Sen. Ted Cruz apologized Tuesday to Republican senators for disrupting their schedules last weekend when he unexpectedly forced the chamber to be in session after Senate leaders had agreed to send everyone home. ""It was a sincere effort to apologize to those he may have put out,"" said Sen. Dean Heller, R-Nevada, about the apology, which was delivered behind closed doors at the weekly Republican policy lunch in the Capitol. The controversial move by Cruz -- what amounted to a procedural sneak attack -- caught his leaders and colleagues off guard.  Many were angry because they had already left town for family and holiday events and had to come back for a lengthy Saturday session. ""I think it's always appropriate to apologize for unnecessarily causing other people a distress or concern or requiring a change of plan that was completely unexpected,"" Sen. Dan Coats, R-Indiana, said. The schedule change also helped Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid move about two dozen nominations, some controversial, who otherwise might not have been confirmed before the end of the session. Cruz did not apologize for assisting the Democrats push through these nominees, senators said. ""I am pleased the Sen. Cruz apologized,"" said Sen Susan Collins, R-Maine.  ""I believe it was warranted and I give him credit for doing so. I hope that he will learn from this experience."" Sen. Kelly Ayotte, R-New Hampshire, had flown home to take her daughter to The Nutcracker before getting word she would need to return. ""I appreciate his apology but they're getting a number of nominations,"" they otherwise wouldn't have, Ayotte said, still sounding frustrated. ""All he has to do is keep us informed about what his tactics are and what he's going to try to achieve and to what lengths he'll go,"" Heller said.  ""I don't blame him for what he did.

"(CNN) -- A volcano near southwest Colombia's border with Ecuador erupted on Saturday, leading the government to issue a ""red alert"" for the region. The Galeras volcano is shown on January 17, 2008, from Pasto, Colombia. There were not believed to be any fatalities or injuries in the blast, which happened at about 7:10 p.m. ET (12:10 a.m. Sunday GMT), said Carlos Lineras of the Colombia Institute for Geology and Mines. The institute issued an evacuation order for about 7,000 people living near the Galeras volcano. The volcano is not in a heavily populated region. Galeras has erupted several times since it became active again in 1989. The only fatalities were in 1993, when nine people -- all scientists or tourists in or near the volcano's crater -- were killed.","No deaths, injuries feared from eruption, authority says .

"(CNN) -- Two Pennsylvania men convicted of a hate crime in the beating death of an undocumented Mexican immigrant were each sentenced Wednesday to spend nine years behind bars, according to a U.S. District Court statement. Derrick Donchak, of Shenandoah, and Brandon Piekarsky, of Shenandoah Heights, were found guilty in federal court in October of several charges, including hate crimes and depriving the victim Luis Ramirez of his civil rights. The two were acquitted of murder charges in state court and convicted of simple assault. During the federal trial, witnesses testified that racist language was used before and during the attack and that Ramirez was kicked in the head repeatedly after he fell down. The defendants, they said, didn't want immigrants in their neighborhood and repeatedly ordered Ramirez to leave. Attorneys for the defendants said the encounter had been no more than a fight fueled by testosterone and alcohol. Three former Pennsylvania police officers were also charged, accused of trying to cover up the incident. In January, a federal jury found former Shenandoah Police Chief Matthew Nestor and officers William Moyer and Jason Hayes not guilty of conspiracy to obstruct a federal investigation in Ramirez's July 2008 death. Nestor, however, was found guilty of falsifying reports, and Moyer was convicted of lying to the FBI. Hayes, who was also accused of falsifying police reports, was acquitted of the two charges against him.","NEW: Two Pennsylvania men were sentenced to nine years in prison .

With four hotels, 200,000 square feet of convention space, a 2,000-seat performing arts center, 18-hole Jack Nicklaus Signature golf course, 30 restaurants and bars, 14 distinct pools and a 100,000-square-foot casino large enough to rival any in Las Vegas or Macau, the $3.5 billion development known as Baha Mar is kind of a big deal. In fact, the so-called ""Bahamian Riviera"" is the largest single-phase luxury resort project in the history of the Caribbean and the most substantial currently in development in the Western Hemisphere. Located along Nassau's famed Cable Beach, Baha Mar is expected to send ripples across the Caribbean when it opens to the public in late spring 2015 with a grand gala produced by music and entertainment legends Jamie King and Emilio Estefan. The event is meant to herald the arrival of a new Riviera -- one full of 21st-century entertainment located right in Florida's backyard. Mons, Belgium . Mons, Belgium, has a population of just 93,072 people, but the small city expects 2 million visitors to ply its medieval streets when it hosts more than 1,000 cultural and artistic events in 2015 as the offical European Capital of Culture. Highlights of the yearlong celebration include an illuminating new Van Gogh exhibit, three multidisciplinary arts festivals, numerous public installations and art-infused parties. Moreover, Mons will unveil not one, not two, but an astounding five new museums in April, including The Artotheque (art library) and Mons Memorial Museum. Think of 2015 as a coming out party for this former mining and industrial center that's completely reinventing itself. Downtown Los Angeles . A decade ago, you'd have struggled to find life on the streets of downtown Los Angeles after the office lights went dim for the night. But what was once the city's dark center has rapidly transformed into one of its most exciting neighborhoods, with more than 500 shops, restaurants, bars and clubs opening their doors in the past five years alone. Exciting new hotels like the Ace, stores like Acne Studios and food venues like the revamped Grand Central Market -- in addition to the recently completed $3 billion sports and entertainment complex known as L.A. Live -- have injected downtown with a jolt of energy that's helped lure visitors and residents away from LA's sunny perimeter and into its urban core. The downtown scene is expected to heat up in 2015 when billionaire art collector Eli Broad's $140 million vanity project, the Broad Museum, opens to the public in the fall. The honeycomb-encased gallery has been heralded as the crowning jewel of downtown LA's revival, and will house works by some of the most prominent artists of recent decades, including Jeff Koons, Roy Lichtenstein and Cindy Sherman. Faroe Islands . The Faroe Islands have never really had their moment in the spotlight, but a dance with darkness in 2015 may finally put the remote archipelago between Norway and Iceland on travelers' radars. This self-governing country within the Danish Realm is one of just two places in the world that will witness a total solar eclipse on March 20, 2015, when the moon passes between the earth and sun, plunging daylight into darkness. Several travel agencies are already filling up tours and cruises to the storybook isles for this once in a lifetime astronomical event. Though it'll last just 2 minutes and 47 seconds, Europeans won't see anything like it again until 2026. Coober Pedy, Australia . Alice Springs and Uluru (Ayer's Rock) have long served as the two pinnacles of Outback Australia's tourism duopoly, but an increasing number of visitors are venturing further south along the Stuart Highway to explore the ""underground town"" of Coober Pedy, where 80% of the world's opal comes from. Coober Pedy will celebrate its Centenary in 2015 with a year's worth of events, including an opal festival, gem show, marathon, dances and street parties. Tourists heading into town for the celebrations will have the opportunity to sleep as the locals do in subterranean dugouts that promise a consistent temperature of 25 C (77 F). There will, perhaps, be nowhere else on earth in 2015 where you can shop for bargain-basement gems, march in a street parade and retire to your underground hotel room ... all in one day. Singapore . Singapore has a reputation for being pretty and dull in equal measure. However, the undeniably attractive isle of Singapore will be anything but boring in 2015 as it celebrates 50 years of independence with fireworks, parades, shows, youth rallies and a new walkway from the Civic District to Marina Bay. Yet, Singapore's Golden Jubilee isn't the only reason to visit in 2015. The long-awaited National Gallery will finally open to the public in November and join recently unveiled attractions like River Safari and the massive Singapore Sports Hub in diversifying the city's offerings. Salta, Argentina . What if you could visit the Grand Canyon and Napa Valley within the course of one afternoon? That, in essence, is what's on offer in Salta Province, a dusty patch of Andean Argentina where the country bumps up against Bolivia, Chile and Paraguay. Salta is home to colorful colonial towns, gnarled mountainscapes and the highest altitude wineries in the world. With a $160 million plan underway to turn this largely domestic destination into the eco-tourism capital of Latin America, this is a cat that's about to be let out of the bag. If you like your wine with a side of adventure -- and want to take advantage of Argentina's exceedingly favorable ""blue dollar"" exchange rate -- Salta will be ready and waiting in 2015. Milan . The World's Fair has left the planet with many icons -- the Eiffel Tower, the Space Needle, the first Ferris wheel -- but the legacy of Expo Milano 2015 will likely be in the ideas it generates, rather than any architectural marvels. Travelers from around the world are expected to converge on Italy's second-largest city between May and October to ruminate on the future of food within a 1.1 million-square-meter fairgrounds plotted out like a classical Roman metropolis. The event promises to put participants from more than 140 counties in touch with an estimated 20 million visitors across 60 pavilions, a record number exceeding even the 2010 World's Fair in Shanghai. Expect exotic food tastings, educational lectures and rich, multi-sensory experiences. Mekong and Irrawaddy rivers . Small cruise vessels have long been a staple of European rivers, but with river cruising ballooning into the fastest-growing segment of the travel industry (according to industry reports), many boats will find new homes in 2015 along two of Southeast Asia's most important waterways: the Mekong and Irrawaddy rivers. More than a dozen new ships from a half-dozen companies (including Viking, Haimark and Avalon Waterways) will set sail in 2015 on journeys through Myanmar or across the Vietnam-Cambodia border from Ho Chi Minh City to Siem Reap. For those who always wanted to see Southeast Asia, but didn't want to deal with the hassle of tuk-tuks and touts, there's never been an easier (or more comfortable) way. Abu Dhabi . Dubai may have exploded into a theme park of superlatives, but its oil-rich neighbor Abu Dhabi has steered a different course in a multibillion-dollar bid to become the cultural capital of the Middle East. At the heart of Abu Dhabi's reinvention is the 24,000-square-meter Saadiyat Island Cultural District. This intellectual playground is set to house the Guggenheim Abu Dhabi in 2017, the Zayed National Museum in 2016 and, if all goes according to plan, the first Louvre Museum outside Paris by the end of next year. Add to the mix a performing arts center designed by Zaha Hadid, and it's clear that both the skyline and city below are about to get a lot more inspiring.

"President Barack Obama on Monday reminisced of better times with New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, his onetime hug-buddy turned Republican antagonist as the governor has turned his focus to an expected presidential bid. The governor greeted Obama on the tarmac as he emerged from Air Force One for a visit to the state to speak to troops at New Jersey's Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst. There, Obama recounted to the press his visit to the Jersey Shore with Christie last year to survey the Hurricane Sandy recovery efforts there. ""Christie and I went down to Asbury Park, spent some time on the boardwalk. We played a little Frog Bog. Chris' kids taught me how to hit the hammer to get those little frogs into the buckets,"" Obama recalled. He admitted: ""It was hard."" ""And then Christie beat me at football toss, which really aggravated me,"" Obama said, remembering that Christie ""bragged"" about his win afterwards. ""Which is okay, but I will get a rematch at some point,"" Obama promised. Christie has previously complimented Obama and drew criticism from Republicans after he was photographed in a sideways embrace with the president when he visited the state to survey the damage done by Hurricane Sandy in 2012. The warm relationship between the two has been called a ""bromance"" in the media. The governor is considered one of a handful of likely Republican presidential contenders, and routinely polls in the top four or five in the potential GOP field. And in recent years, Christie has become more critical of Obama. In September, Christie charged the President had ""underestimated what had been taking place in Syria"" and saying he was ""disturbed"" by how the president had handled the growing threat from the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS). On Monday, however, Obama touted the U.S. offensive against ISIS, declaring it has ""blunted their momentum and put them on the defensive.""

"The Korean Air executive who delayed a flight over a bag of macadamia nuts may face legal action after South Korea's transportation ministry said on Tuesday it had filed a complaint to prosecutors. Heather Cho, who resigned from her post last week, may be in violation of aviation safety laws, the ministry said, after she ordered the Seoul-bound plane to turn back to the gate and that a flight attendant be removed all because she was served nuts in a bag instead of on a plate in first class. Testimonies of crew members and passengers confirm that Cho used ""violent language in a loud voice,"" which may not be compliant with an aviation safety law that requires cooperation of passengers on a flight, the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport said in a press release. Although her role put her in charge of in-flight service, she was only a passenger on the flight and was not flying in an official capacity. Cho, whose Korean name is Cho Hyun-ah, will report to the prosecutor's office on Wednesday, as part of an ongoing investigation. The airline also faces possible disciplinary action from the government because of the captain's failure to command and supervise crew members to ensure the safe operation of the flight, said the ministry. Calling it quits . Cho resigned last week from the airline's catering and in-flight sales business, and from its cabin service and hotel business divisions, Korean Air said. But the 40-year-old kept her title as a vice president of the national carrier, according to company spokesman. The company chairman, Cho Yang-ho, who is also her father, publicly apologized for the incident, saying that she will resign from the vice president job and positions held in affiliate companies. Public outcry . The incident, which took place last week at New York's JFK airport, stirred anger among the South Korean public. ""She was one of the passengers, not the vice president of Korean Air at that moment. I'm not sure what she was thinking, but it's likely she was bossy and acted above her position,"" Baek Ki-Jong, a South Korean resident, told CNN. ""It was an abuse of power, and a wrong action to take,"" he said. Angered Internet users have condemned Cho for bringing about international embarrassment and shame to the country. They are calling for Korean Air to change its name to Hanjin Airlines in a petition on Agora, a popular Korean online discussion forum. Korean Air is owned by South Korea's large family-owned corporations, known as Hanjin. ""Hanjin Group's 'Korean Air' is no longer a national company. They should not use 'Korea' in the name. As a citizen of Korea, I cannot allow the word Korea to be used,"" commented ""Acorn"", one user on the site. Despite the public outrage, the scandal has triggered an unexpected boon for some of Korea's online retailers. Booming sales . Sales for macadamia nuts have surged 20-fold over the past week on Gmarket, Korea's most popular online shopping site which is owned by eBay, said Lee, a company spokesperson who declined to give his full name. The round, white nuts have become the top two best sellers on another Korean online retailer, Coupang. One brand, Mauna Loa, sold out earlier but is now back in stock. Some Coupang users left comments on the site demanded that the nuts they ordered to be shipped and delivered on a plate, and not in a bag.

"(CNN) -- Its lack of productivity and partisan drama ensure that Congress remains the butt of political jokes. It has been pegged as less popular than lice, cockroaches, the IRS and eating vegetables. A new round of derision surfaced as the House and Senate began their August recess, leaving mounds of unfinished business in their wake. Arguably the most pressing thing is stalled legislation to address the surge of migrant youth, many of them unaccompanied, across the southern border this year. (Congress did get some things done in the final days before its summer break. It agreed to keep road construction projects funded through next May, provide more money for Israel's Iron Dome missile defense system, and overhaul the Veterans Affairs medical system). But fresh polls confirm that Congress is not doing a whole lot of legislating and the public doesn't like it. A new poll Monday by NBC News/Wall Street Journal/Marist College found that only 3% of registered voters surveyed thought Congress has been ""productive."" And the Pew Research Center found that this Congress has been the least productive one since 1997-98. Finally, a July Gallup poll found that Congress had a 15% approval rating. Polls convey public opinion scientifically, but the freewheeling nature of social media produced similar sentiment. An executive at the libertarian Cato Institute pointed out that Congress and President Barack Obama are less popular than the most disliked Star Wars characters. But everyone loves Internet news. Take some advice with that criticism, Congress. Obviously. Same-sex marriage is getting more popular. So is pot. And the United States just might be turning into a soccer country. Congress, still not that likable, though. Although this tweet was before the CIA admitted to spying on the Senate committee in charge of overseeing the spy agency. One thing more popular than Congress: Obama, who is not very popular. Perhaps this is some insight into why Congress is so unlikable right now. The good news. There's little place to go but up.","Congress pegged as less popular than cockroaches, the IRS and eating vegetables .

"(CNN) -- Air quality in most cities that monitor their pollution levels exceed what the World Health Organization deems as safe. Delhi has the highest level of the airborne particulate matter, PM2.5 considered most harmful to health, with 153 micrograms. Not far behind is another Indian city, Patna with 149 micrograms. These figures are six times what the WHO considers a ""safe"" limit -- which is 25 micrograms. Half of the top 20 cities in the world with the highest levels of PM2.5 were in India, according to the pollution data released by the WHO, which included 1,600 cities. Other cities with high levels were located in Pakistan and Bangladesh. PM2.5 refers to the diameter measured in microns of particulates such as ammonia, carbon, nitrates and sulfate -- which are small enough to pass into the bloodstream and cause diseases such as emphysema and cancer. The WHO data echoes an earlier study this year which found that air pollution in New Delhi is now worse than Beijing. No Chinese cities ranked in the top 20 most polluted cities, despite thick, gray smog filling its cities and millions of residents commuting behind surgical masks. Beijing reported 56 micrograms of PM2.5. This year, Chinese leaders have declared ""war on pollution."" Beijing's emergency measures amid fog of pollution . Delhi has been described as having weak enforcement of pollution controls by India's Center for Science and Environment, a public interest group.

"Words have been a part of Marjorie Liu's life as far back as she could remember. She would  devour children's  books sitting in her mother's lap, dreaming up adventures of her own she wanted to share. But the New York Times bestselling author never thought her passion for writing could earn her a living, so she set her sights on a career in law, spending years diligently poring over law books to pass the bar. ""I was going to be a lawyer and I had studied hard,"" Liu says, ""but then it suddenly occurred to me in a very deep, profound way that I didn't want to keep practicing law for the rest of my life,"" she adds. Follow the dream . Liu was struck with the impulse to fulfill her dream of writing a novel, and brushing off concerns from those around her, she closed herself off in her apartment for a month to write. She worked feverishly for 14 hours a day, producing her first novel --  a paranormal magic thriller called ""Tiger Eye"". Her leap of faith paid off, and the book  was bought by a publishing house and  turned into a four-sequel contract. Nine years after her debut, the 35 year-old is a celebrated writer with 17 novels to her name and myriad of literary awards. ""I had my dreams, and even though everyone told me that they weren't practical, I knew in my heart that this is what I had to do. Even if it ended up being a failure, I had to make the attempt,"" she says. Expanding the portfolio . Apart from traditional novels, Liu also found her calling in comic books. She has written issues for Marvel Comics' ""Dark Wolverine"" and ""Astonishing X-Men"" series, for which she was nominated for a GLAAD Media Award for outstanding media images of the LGBT community last year. Liu also teaches comic book writing at MIT, even though she only became familiar with the genre at college after stumbling across it in a local bookstore. ""I didn't know how to write comics, I had to teach myself,"" she says, ""I had never been a comic book person before really because I had no access to them. Once I had access I thought that these are just another avenue for telling stories and delving into the imagination"" she adds. In spite of managing to turn her passion into her job, Liu doesn't regret the years she spent toiling away at law school: ""There was no guarantee that this would work out. I don't want to give people the wrong advice to follow their dreams no matter what because it's not fun to be a starving artist. ""But on the other hand,  life is short and if you are burning with a passion to do something then do it. Work hard, study hard at it and don't give up,"" she says.","Marjorie Liu is a New York Times bestselling author .

"Kenyan Wangari Maathai, the first woman from Africa to win the Nobel Peace Prize, died Monday after a battle with cancer. She was 71. Maathai, an environmentalist, had long campaigned for human rights and the empowerment of Africa's most impoverished people. More than 30 years ago she founded the Green Belt Movement, a tree-planting campaign to simultaneously mitigate deforestation and to give locals, especially women and girls, access to resources like firewood for cooking and clean water. They have since planted more than 40 million trees. ""Professor Maathai's departure is untimely and a very great loss to all who knew her -- as a mother, relative, co-worker, colleague, role model and heroine -- or who admired her determination to make the world a more peaceful, healthier and better place,"" her organization said. World mourns passing of 'true African heroine' In 2004, she was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for her efforts to promote sustainable development, democracy and peace. ""Her departure is untimely and a very great loss to all of us who knew her—as a mother, relative, co-worker, colleague, role model, and heroine—or those who admired her determination to make the world a peaceful, healthy, and better place for all of us,"" said Karanja Njoroge, executive director of the Green Belt Movement. Born in Nyeri, Kenya, on April 1, 1940, Maathai blazed many trails in her life. She was the first woman in East and Central Africa to earn a doctorate degree. In December 2002, she was elected to Kenya's parliament with an overwhelming 98% of the vote. She was honored by Time magazine in 2005 as one of 100 most influential people in the world. And Forbes listed her as one of 100 most powerful women in the world. In April 2006, France bestowed its highest honor on her: the Legion d'Honneur. Kenyan President Mwai Kibaki called Maathai a ""global icon who has left an indelible mark in the world of environmental conservation."" Her passing elicited tributes from all around the world, like one from U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon in which he described her as ""a pioneer in articulating the links between human rights, poverty, environmental protection and security."" He noted that she'd been active in his organization, including as a U.N. Messenger of Peace and part of a group trying to formulate global millennium development goals. Achmat Dangor, the executive director of the Nelson Mandela Foundation, recalled a 2005 speech that she made before his group in which she laid out specific steps that citizens, governments and businesses could take to protect the environment. ""We need people who love Africa so much that they want to protect her from destructive processes,"" Maathai said then. ""There are simple actions we can take."" British Foreign Secretary William Hague called the passing of the ""charismatic figure ... a great loss to the world,"" and fellow environmental activist and former U.S. Vice President Al Gore recalled her as a woman who ""worked tirelessly (to become) a true inspiration for us all."" And U.S. President Barack Obama said that Maathai's life-long fight continues, building off what she was able to accomplish and the minds and policies she was able to shape over her lifetime. ""As she told the world, 'We must not tire, we must not give up, we must persist,'"" Obama said in a statement. ""Her legacy will stand as an example to all of us to persist in our pursuit of progress."" Maathai leaves behind three children and a granddaughter.","Obama says ""her legacy will stand"" on environmental and other issues .

"India's prime minister called for calm Sunday after clashes erupted between police and demonstrators protesting a gang rape in the country's capital. ""We will make all possible efforts to ensure security and safety to all women in this country,"" Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said. ""I appeal to all concerned citizens to maintain peace and calm."" Public outrage has surged after the gang rape and beating of a 23-year-old woman on a moving bus on December 16. The prime minister's comments came after thousands of protesters defied a ban on demonstrations in New Delhi on Sunday. For a second day, demonstrators were blasted with water cannons. While some dispersed, others huddled tightly in a circle to brave high-pressure streams in the cold December weather. ""We want justice!"" the protesters shouted in chorus. In addition to banners and cardboard placards, many demonstrators carried Indian flags as they scuffled with police. Authorities fired tear gas to try to break up crowds. Police spokesman Rajan Bhagat said ""hooligans who had joined the protesters"" hurled stones, injuring 78 officers. At least 65 protesters were also injured, he said. Many police vans and a dozen public buses were damaged during the demonstrations, he said. As he appealed for peace Sunday, Singh acknowledged that the anger is ""genuine and justified."" Authorities haven't released the name of the rape victim, but protesters are calling her ""Damini,"" which means ""lightning"" in Hindi. ""Damini"" is also a 1993 Bollywood film whose lead female character fights for a housemaid, a victim of a sexual assault. ""We support you Damini. We'll keep fighting for you,"" a middle-aged woman at the historic India Gate said Sunday. ""Damini wants justice,"" read a placard at the protest. Police bundled scores of young protesters into buses in the Raisina Hill area, home of the India Gate, the presidential palace, the parliament building and ministerial offices. Demonstrators slipped under police vans to deflate tires and prevent them from driving off. Officers dragged them out. The rape victim's injuries were so severe she spent days in intensive care in a city hospital, battling for her life. Police said Saturday that she had recovered enough to give a statement to a magistrate from her hospital bed the night before. Surviving rape: iReporters speak out . The protest was among a number of anti-rape demonstrations held across the country in the past week. A video journalist was killed by police gunfire Sunday during a violent protest in India's remote northeastern state of Manipur, authorities said. The journalist was covering a protest against a separate molestation case in the provincial capital of Imphal, state police said. Protests have rocked Manipur over the alleged molestation of a local actress by a suspected militant on December 18, during a public performance. Protesters had torched a vehicle, forcing police to open fire, officer Manik Longjam said Sunday. The journalist died in the gunfire, Longjam said. Police said the molester was still at large. Official data show that reported rape cases have increased more than tenfold over the past 40 years -- from 2,487 in 1971 to 24,206 in 2011. New Delhi alone reported 572 rapes last year and more than 600 in 2012. Opinion: Rapes show that Indian society needs a new attitude . Six suspects, including the bus driver and a minor, have now been arrested in connection with the rape of ""Damini."" As fury about the assault gathered pace, some Indian lawmakers called for treating rape as a capital crime. ""We'll work collectively to see we make a law which is deterrent and preventive,"" said New Delhi's chief minister, Sheila Dikshit. India's Home Minister Sushilkumar Shinde told reporters Saturday that the government would work toward increasing punishment in ""rarest of the rare"" rape cases. But pressed on whether the administration would agree to demands for death by hanging in such instances, he said: ""We'll have to see in what way it (the rape sentencing) can be enhanced."" Shinde said the government was pushing for a speedy trial for the attack. Authorities are also taking a number of steps to improve security for women in New Delhi, particularly on public transport, he said. ""(The) government shares the widespread concern and support that has been expressed throughout society for the girl who has so suffered. Government also respects the right of legitimate protest,"" Shinde said. ""At the same time, there is need to exercise calm at this juncture and for everyone to work together to improve the safety and security environment."" In the meantime, the victim has been promised the best possible medical care, Shinde said. A physician described the woman's condition Saturday as better than a day earlier, but said there was still a risk of infection. She is receiving psychological as well as medical care, he said.

""The incident has raised the issue of declining public confidence in the law and order machinery in the city, especially in its capacity to ensure safety of women, as a number of such incidents have been reported in the national capital in the recent past,"" the National Human Rights Commission said in a statement Tuesday.

"Obamacare is expected to increase patient demand for medical services. Combine that with a worsening shortage of doctors, and next year you may have to wait a little longer to get a doctor's appointment. And the crowded emergency room may become even more so. There are approximately 48 million uninsured people in the United States. When the mandatory insurance rules of Obamacare kick in next year, and a couple dozen states expand who is eligible for Medicaid, you can bet more people are going to want to use their health benefits. In fact, so many people were anxious to get access to health insurance -- many for the first time -- when the insurance marketplaces opened Tuesday, more than a dozen of the websites experienced technical glitches. Obamacare open enrollment: Everything you need to know . Dr. Ryan A. Stanton is worried that this coming flood of newly insured patients may crash the U.S. health care system as well. Stanton works at the emergency room at the busy Georgetown Community Hospital right outside of Lexington, Kentucky. While he sees trauma cases often, a good number of the patients he sees don't involve trauma. They're the uninsured who can't afford to pay for a regular doctor's visit -- so they use the emergency room instead. ""People turn to the ER because they have no other place to go after hours or they don't have access to a level of appropriate primary care,"" Stanton said. ""The ER has become the safety net of our health care system.  We can't turn anyone away like a doctor's office could. ... I worry though with (Obamacare) this will significantly increase patient volume."" There is already a national shortage of doctors, according to the Association of American Medical Colleges. We're down about 20,000 now, and the number is expected to get worse as nearly half the nation's physicians are over age 50 -- meaning many are at or near retirement age. And it's not just doctors who are in short supply; we also need more nurses, according to the American Medical Association. ""Keep in mind the Affordable Care Act didn't create this crisis,"" said Dr. Reid Blackwelder, president of the American Academy of Family Physicians.  ""We've got an aging population that needs more care and a growing population."" Government shutdown forces clinical trial patients to wait . A study in the Annals of Family Medicine journal projected the country will need 52,000 more primary care physicians by 2025. Most of those extra doctors are needed because of projected population growth. But the problem also begins in training; only one in five graduating medical residents plan to go into primary care, according to the Journal of the American Medical Association. Stanton said he might have been interested in primary care rather than emergency care, but the lower pay kept him away. Doctors on average graduate with hundreds of thousands of dollars of debt. Specialists make more money. ""Primary care is the backbone of our medical system, but most people I know in medical school can't afford to go that route,"" Stanton said. If the popularity of the insurance marketplaces on the first day they opened is any sign, there will be a lot more people in Kentucky fighting to get a doctor's attention. Problems plagued the Kentucky exchange site until midafternoon, but still more than 1,200 people had purchased policies or enrolled in Medicaid by the end of the day, according to a spokeswoman for the Cabinet for Health and Family Services. ""I think of (Obamacare) as giving everyone an ATM card in a town where there are no ATM machines,"" Stanton said. ""The coming storm of patients means when they can't get in to see a primary care physician, even more people will end up with me in the emergency room."" What happened in Massachusetts in 2006 when the state's mandated health insurance rules went into effect illustrates the impending national problem. When the Massachusetts law kicked in, wait times to get an appointment at primary care physicians' offices increased significantly, and they've remained high ever since, according to an annual survey from the Massachusetts Medical Society. And Massachusetts has the second highest physician-to-population ratio of any state. When patients couldn't get doctor's appointments they once again turned to emergency rooms. A Harvard study found all 11 of the emergency rooms that researchers studied in Massachusetts became busier after the law went into effect. The Affordable Care Act does try to address some of the problems. There's an additional $1.5 billion in funding allotted for the National Health Services Corps, which provides support to health care professionals in exchange for their service in areas with a shortage (physician numbers are particularly stretched thin in rural areas). The law also puts more money toward training in hopes of increasing the primary care workforce. It offers more graduate positions for primary care doctors and more scholarships. It even offers a 10% bonus to primary care doctors who agree to see Medicare patients through 2015. The law's emphasis on coverage for preventive care may also mean fewer people will need to visit doctors for more serious issues down the road. Blackwelder is optimistic that this problem will be the prompt the system needs to address these long-standing issues with our medical system. He admits, though, that he's a ""glass-half-full kind of guy."" He suggests existing technology could help. Not all patients actually need to see him personally; if there is a way to set up an online system so patients could access records, e-mail simple questions or request prescription refills, that would cut down on the amount of time they'd have to spend in his office. Blackwelder also thinks a team approach would be more productive in health care practices -- something many hospitals are already trying to adopt. ""In Kingsport, Tennessee, where I work, I'm happy to see patients, but we also have a health department or retail clinics that people could go to for their flu shots or other treatments,"" Blackwelder said. ""And if we maintained good communication with those other providers we could also avoid duplication of services and increase our overall effectiveness."" Qualified nurse practitioners might also be able to lighten some of the primary care physicians' load, as would physician assistants if such practices are allowed. But in some states that are already desperate for doctors, such as Mississippi, nurse practitioners must legally practice under the guidance of a physician. Why your waiter has an MD . Other solutions could include opening more residency slots for doctors. Blackwelder said he'd also love to see universities discount tuition for students who studied primary care. ""I'd love for them to say to a student, 'I hear you are interested in primary care,' and present them with a bill with only zeros on it,"" he said. ""And then say to people who were going into a specialty, 'Here's your tuition bill,' with a number in front of all those zeros."" People were worried the health care system would be overwhelmed when Medicare and Medicaid started in the 1960s too, Kentucky Gov. Steve Beshear told CNN chief medical correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta, but the system adapted. ""I understand there is a sense of worry, and change can be scary, but our present system is broken,"" Blackwelder said.  ""We pay twice as much for our health in this country and have worse outcomes than other countries. ""We will have to start coming up with creative solutions to this problem -- ones that won't have to wait for an act from Congress.""","Approximately 48 million people are currently uninsured in the United States .

"A Republican tide ripped the Senate away from Democrats Tuesday, giving the GOP full control of Congress and the power to pin down President Barack Obama during his last two years in office. The thumping win upends the balance of power between the White House and Capitol Hill only six years after Obama's Democrats swept to power and marginalized Republicans in a rush to reform health care, Wall Street and pass a huge stimulus package. Now, it's Democrats who will take the back seat on Capitol Hill, relying mostly on the power of the filibuster to stymie Republicans and keep Obama's legacy intact. ""For too long, this administration has tried to tell the American people what is good for them and then blame somebody else when their policies didn't work out,"" Mitch McConnell, who is expected to become the next Senate majority leader, said in a victory speech. In the House, CNN projected the GOP will have at least 246 seats, its largest majority since World War II. Speaker John Boehner, celebrating a widened majority, said he is ""humbled by the responsibility the American people have placed with us."" ""But this is not a time for celebration,"" he said. ""It's time for government to start getting results and implementing solutions to the challenges facing our country, starting with our still-struggling economy. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, who has controlled the Senate since 2007, congratulated Republicans on their victory. ""The message from voters is clear: they want us to work together,"" Reid said. ""I look forward to working with Senator McConnell to get things done for the middle class."" Obama will make a statement Wednesday afternoon on an election many will see as a repudiation of his presidency, and he will host bipartisan leaders Friday to try to chart a way forward. GOP governors win blue states Maryland, Massachusetts, Illinois . Democratic losses pile up . Democratic fears of a rout came true, as party candidates struggled to defend seats won in the 2008 Obama wave in conservative territory, and couldn't get out from under an unpopular president limping through his second term. The losses in Colorado and Iowa will sting especially hard, as those two states enjoyed a fabled place in Obama's world, as drivers of the president's unlikely bid for the White House in 2008. The GOP also piled up wins in Montana, South Dakota, Arkansas, West Virginia and North Carolina — all seats that had been in Democratic hands — to surpass their magic number of six net gains. With seats still to be decided in Virginia, Alaska and Louisiana -- where there will be a runoff in December -- the GOP currently has 52 seats in the Senate. Republican numbers stood up when the GOP managed to hold on to seats in Kansas and Georgia which had threatened to fall from their grasp and complicate the Senate math. It was a night of almost unrelenting misery for Democrats: . • In Iowa, Iraq war veteran Joni Ernst became the first woman elected to Congress from her state, after turning around her Republican campaign with an ad in which she boasted about castrating hogs. • In North Carolina, Democrat Kay Hagan was felled by Thom Tillis, who repeatedly pummeled her for standing shoulder-to-shoulder with Obama. • Arkansas Sen. Mark Pryor lost to Tom Cotton, who, like Ernst, is an Iraq war veteran. Pryor's loss comes despite former president Bill Clinton's efforts to save him in his beloved home state. • Democrats thought they had Colorado, with its mix of young voters, Hispanics and students locked down for a generation. But Sen. Mark Udall tumbled to charismatic challenger Cory Gardner who shook off claims he was anti-women. • Virginia Democratic Sen. Mark Warner is having a tougher ride than expected against Republican challenger Ed Gillespie in a state Democrats had thought was reliably theirs after Obama won it twice. A rare ray of hope for Democrats came in New Hampshire, where Sen. Jeanne Shaheen bested challenger Scott Brown. And Pennsylvania's governor's mansion reverted to Democrats when Tom Wolf unseated Republican Gov. Tom Corbett in a marquee race. New superstars, new villains and other takeaways . Governors . Two other Republican governors meanwhile won reelection and stirred buzz for their own 2016 White House prospects — John Kasich in swing state Ohio, and conservative Republican Scott Walker in Wisconsin. In New Mexico, Republican Gov. Susana Martinez, often mentioned as a possible GOP vice presidential pick, strolled to reelection. Maryland -- a traditionally Democratic state -- elected Republican Larry Hogan as governor. And Illinois, Obama's home state, ousted its Democratic governor. Republicans will now look with some optimism on the 2016 presidential election. But Democrats will console themselves with a more favorable Senate map in two years' time and the belief that shifting demographics and an unresolved war between the Republican grassroots and the party establishment will make the next presidential race a tough climb for the GOP.

"(CNN)When Thomas Cristofoletti walked into the Hyperstar supermarket in Shiraz, Iran, he was stopped at the door. He had his camera over his shoulder, and the international-style grocery store was built inside a large mall with a strict policy against photography. ""They almost wouldn't even let me bring the camera inside,"" Cristofoletti recalled. He was able to bring his camera inside, however, and when he saw a woman shopping in a colorful, patterned headscarf he made a surreptitious click of the shutter. ""I was able to take that one without looking,"" he said of an image he made for his series exploring Western-style consumerism in Iran. A former advertising director in Italy and Spain, Cristofoletti left the profession behind four years ago and moved to Cambodia to pursue photography. He founded RUOM, a collective of journalists who specialize in social reportage in Southeast Asia. Last year, Cristofoletti got the opportunity to visit friends working as graphic designers in Iran and he jumped on the chance to see what daily life is like there. ""I've always been interested in closed countries,"" he said. ""I got this great opportunity to be there with locals. You are able to see things in a very different way."" During Cristofoletti's monthlong stay in Iran, he began to notice the differences in the way Iranians live their public and private lives. He realized that daily life in Iran contradicted the way Iran is typically portrayed. ""The perception we have (about Iran) is not real,"" he said. ""My idea was to try to see with my eyes what is the reality of Iran."" Cristofoletti chose to show this new reality by documenting the increasing presence of Western-style consumerism in a country steeped in tradition. His photos juxtapose typical Iranian markets with modern, brightly lit shopping malls. ""Even if traditional grand bazaars continue to be the favorite places to shop for regular Iranians, they now face competition from huge shopping malls, which were erected in the outskirts of major cities across the country,"" Cristofoletti said. The malls feature supermarkets, international brands and vibrant video game arcades as a kind of alternative entertainment. ""I was really surprised to see these kind of modern stores and malls,"" he said. ""Shopping has become a near-obsessive ritual for young people."" Cristofoletti notes that for women especially, some aspects of Western culture are particularly alluring. He found that because Iranian women are prohibited from showing any part of their body except for the face, they have taken to buying high-end beauty products and undergoing plastic surgery to make their features look more European or American. It is through these measures, Cristofoletti said, that women are able to ""rebel"" against government-imposed restrictions. Cristofoletti was aware of certain constraints to life in Iran, and he consulted with a journalist there before his trip who advised him that it was safer to go as just a tourist rather than as a journalist.

I spent a lot of time in the malls and just acted like a normal tourist. (The authorities) don't see you as a problem."" Cristofoletti wants his project to change the way people around the world think about Iran. ""It's no different from our country,"" he said. ""There is this will of the people to be free.

"The first woman bishop to serve in the Church of England was named Wednesday in a historic step that follows years of sometimes contentious debate. Downing Street announced that the Rev. Libby Lane, who was been a priest since 1994, will be the new bishop of Stockport, in northern England. She will be consecrated as a bishop on January 26. Her appointment brings to a close a thorny chapter in the church's recent history. Women have been able to serve as priests in the Church of England since the early 1990s. But some traditionalists resisted the move to allow them to become bishops, culminating in the issue being narrowly voted down in 2012 by the General Synod, the three-times-a-year meeting that sets policies for the church. Two years earlier, the church's governing body had narrowly rejected a measure, aimed at satisfying conservatives, that would have allowed parishes that opposed women bishops to have an additional male bishop. A revised proposal was finally approved by Church of England leaders last month. Speaking at a news conference in Stockport, Lane said she was grateful but also ""somewhat daunted"" to be chosen. ""This is unexpected and very exciting,"" she said. ""On this historic day as the Church of England announces the first woman nominated to be bishop, I am very conscious of all those who have gone before me, women and men, who for decades have looked forward to this moment. But most of all I am thankful to God."" Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby -- who has backed allowing women to be bishops -- said he was delighted by her selection. ""Her Christ-centered life, calmness and clear determination to serve the church and the community make her a wonderful choice,"" he said. Archbishop of York John Sentamu said he would preside over Lane's consecration as a bishop ""with great joy."" Lane, a mother of two whose husband is an airport chaplain, will serve as a suffragan, or junior, bishop in the Diocese of Chester. Reform, an Anglican evangelical network that has opposed the introduction of women bishops, warned that Lane's appointment would strain relations in the diocese. ""We have known since July that the Church of England would seek to appoint women to the episcopate -- against the biblical model of good church leadership,"" Rod Thomas, chairman of Reform, said in a statement. ""Though it grieves us, it comes as no surprise. We pray that the Bishop of Chester will uphold the promises made in July and enable the many thriving conservative evangelical churches in his Diocese to continue to serve their communities with theological integrity under the oversight of a male bishop."" The Church of England is the largest church of the Anglican Communion, with more than 26 million baptized members. The communion represents more than 85 million people in 165 countries, including the U.S. Episcopal Church. The Anglican Communion News Service lists church districts that have women bishops including New Zealand and Polynesia, Australia, Canada, the Episcopal Church, Cuba, Southern Africa, Ireland and South India.","Conservative Anglican group says, ""Though it grieves us, it comes as no surprise""

"As they make a final push to approve presidential nominations before Republicans take control of the Senate, Democrats said Tuesday the confirmation of a record number of federal judges was evidence they were right to make controversial changes to filibuster rules, despite objections from Republicans. ""Yes,"" Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid responded loudly when asked if still believes he was right to employ the so-called ""nuclear option"" a year ago in order to clear a backlog of nominees. The No. 2 Senate Democrat explained that at the time there was a ""breakdown in the relationship between the executive and legislative branch."" ""If you just look at where we were, with all of the nominations stacked on the calendar, most of which had been reported from committees with overwhelming bipartisan votes,"" Sen. Dick Durbin said.  ""Republicans were trying to keep as many nominations from final approval as possible. So we had no choice."" During the first year of the congressional session, before the nuclear option, the Senate confirmed a total of 36 federal district and circuit court judges appointed by the President.  After the rules changes, which took place Nov. 21, 2013, the number of judges confirmed more than doubled to 84. The rules change lowered the number of votes needed to overcome a filibuster from 60 to 51, making it much easier for Democrats, who currently have a 54 to 46 majority, to approve judges to those lifetime positions. Before the Senate adjourns, probably in the next day or two, Democrats hope to confirm an additional 12 district court positions. Democrats this week also cleared a new surgeon general, a top immigration official, and were ready to approve Tuesday the No. 2 at the State Department. Each of those people faced serious GOP opposition and might not have been cleared if not for the rules change. ""The train is running over everyone. That's the Reid train. Last trip around the track,"" complained Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona about the last minute wave of judicial and executive branch nominations Senate Democratic Leader Reid is jamming through. ""It's a result of the nuclear option which deprived us of our ability to advise and consent and it's shameful. McCain and other Republicans also blamed Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, and a small group of other conservatives who forced a weekend session that Reid used to clear procedural hurdles on a number of nominees. ""It was also caused in part by what happened last weekend when several nominees who are controversial are now going to receive Senate votes and are probably going to be confirmed who otherwise probably would not have been,"" said Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine.","Democrats say they have no regrets over changing the Senate rules to approve more judges .

"(CNN) -- New research suggests that crabs not only suffer pain but that they retain a memory of it. No thanks for the memories: The scientific study applied mild electric shocks to hermit crabs to determine if they could 'feel' pain. The study, which was carried out by Professor Bob Elwood and Mirjam Appel from the School of Biological Sciences at Queen's University, Belfast, looked at the reactions of hermit crabs to small electric shocks. It was published in the journal ""Animal Behaviour."" Professor Elwood, whose previous work showed that prawns endure pain, said his research highlighted the need to investigate the treatment of crustaceans used in food industries. Hermit crabs have no shell of their own so inhabit other structures, usually empty mollusc shells. In the research, wires were attached to shells to deliver the small shocks to the abdomen of some of the crabs within the shells. The only crabs to get out of their shells were those which had received shocks, indicating that the experience is unpleasant for them. The research suggests that this response is not just a reflex, but that central neuronal processing takes place. Hermit crabs are known to prefer some species of shells to others and it was found that that they were more likely to come out of the shells they least preferred. The main aim of the experiment was to deliver a shock just under the threshold that causes crabs to move out of the shell, to see what happened when a new shell was then offered. Crabs that had been shocked but had remained in their shell appeared to remember the experience of the shock because they quickly moved towards the new shell, investigated it briefly and were more likely to change to the new shell compared to those that had not been shocked. ""There has been a long debate about whether crustaceans including crabs, prawns and lobsters feel pain,"" said Professor Elwood in a press statement. ""We know from previous research that they can detect harmful stimuli and withdraw from the source of the stimuli but that could be a simple reflex without the inner 'feeling' of unpleasantness that we associate with pain. ""This research demonstrates that it is not a simple reflex but that crabs trade-off their need for a quality shell with the need to avoid the harmful stimulus. ""Such trade-offs are seen in vertebrates in which the response to pain is controlled with respect to other requirements. Humans, for example, may hold onto a hot plate that contains food whereas they may drop an empty plate, showing that we take into account differing motivational requirements when responding to pain. ""Trade-offs of this type have not been previously demonstrated in crustaceans. The results are consistent with the idea of pain being experienced by these animals."" Previous work at Queen's University found that prawns show prolonged rubbing when an antenna was treated with weak acetic acid but this rubbing was reduced by local anesthetic. According to Queen's University the findings from both studies are consistent with observations of pain in mammals. But Professor Elwood says that in contrast to mammals, little protection is given to the millions of crustaceans that are used in the fishing and food industries each day. ""More research is needed in this area where a potentially very large problem is being ignored,"" said Elwood. ""Legislation to protect crustaceans has been proposed but it is likely to cover only scientific research. Millions of crustacean are caught or reared in aquaculture for the food industry. ""There is no protection for these animals (with the possible exception of certain states in Australia) as the presumption is that they cannot experience pain. ""With vertebrates we are asked to err on the side of caution and I believe this is the approach to take with these crustaceans.""","New research from Queen's University says crabs feel and remember pain .

"The world's highest railway rolls even closer to Mount Everest this month when China inaugurates a stretch of track connecting the Tibetan cities of Lhasa and Shigatse. Traversing valleys, mountains and crossing the glacier-fed Brahmaputra River, the line takes in breathtaking views of snow-capped peaks and majestic plateaus as it wends from the territory's capital to its second city. The track is an extension of the Qinghai-Tibet line -- an engineering marvel named the ""closest stretch of railway to the sky"" after it first carried passengers above 5,000 meters (16,404 feet) in 2006. Work on the new $2.1 billion line across the roof of the world began in 2010. When it opens, it will allow passengers to connect by rail from Beijing all the way to Shigatse, a gateway to Everest, which lies just 240 kilometers (150 miles) away, on the border with Nepal. Suolang Deji, an officer with Shigatse's tourism department, told CNN the railway would be inaugurated at the end of August and would initially carry Chinese visitors. ""The first batch of tourists are from Shandong provice,"" she said. Huge investment . With the arrival of the train, the journey from Lhasa to Shigatse shrinks five hours of driving over terrain ranging in altitude from 3,600 to 4,000 meters, to two hours by rail. The railway is part of a huge Chinese investment program in the infrastructure of its remote western territories that is seen as an effort to consolidate Beijing's economic and political control of the autonomous region. Such developments have not been welcomed by some Tibetans who say China invaded their land in 1950 and dispute Beijing's claim that the Himalayan plateau has historically been part of China. Political tensions mean that access to the railway for non-Chinese tourists is likely to be subject to tight controls. In addition to Chinese visas, foreign visitors already require special permits to enter Tibet and the availability of these is subject to sudden change. Anyone hoping to travel on from Shigatse to Everest or Nepal will have to wade through further red tape.","Lhasa to Shigatse railway due to be inaugurated at the end of August .

"The Justice Department is officially dropping its demand that New York Times reporter James Risen reveal a confidential source for a book and articles he wrote. At a hearing Tuesday in federal court in Alexandria, Virginia, prosecutors are asking a judge to approve a limited subpoena of Risen, according to a U.S. official close to the matter. The subpoena is for testimony in the leak prosecution of Jeffrey Sterling, a former CIA officer, who the Justice Department accuses of providing information to Risen. The case has become a high profile test for the Justice Department and how it deals with reporters on leak investigations. The new Justice Department subpoena is now seeking that Risen verify that he wrote the book ""State of War"" and two articles in the New York Times in 2001-2002, that the published material is accurate, that he has a confidential source he won't identify, and that Risen verify that Sterling provided on-the-record quotes published in a New York Times article. The subpoena omits any request for the name of his source and of any information that could lead to the identity. Previously the Justice Department contemplated asking Risen to provide the time and location of where he was, when he received the leaked information, a prospect that risked indirectly identifying Risen's source. The information requested in the new subpoena appears to align with information Risen has said in court filings he is willing to provide. Risen has vowed never to reveal his source for information on a failed CIA operation to sabotage Iran's nuclear program. Attorney General Eric Holder for months has said that he wouldn't force a reporter to go to jail over a source. Recently Justice Department lawyers proposed dropping the request to identify the source, but still push for the time and location information. Deputy Attorney General James Cole advised Holder to not approve the time and location request because Risen would likely still refuse to provide that testimony.","The Department of Justice is now no longer asking a New York Times reporter to reveal his source .

"Texas Sen. Ted Cruz called school choice ""the most compelling civil rights issue of the 21st century"" and suggested it will be a significant focus of the Senate Judiciary Committee's subcommittee on the Constitution, civil rights and human rights when he becomes chairman in the new Congress. The potential GOP presidential contender made the remarks during a Senate hearing on community policing, scheduled in the wake of racial protests sparked by the deaths of two unarmed African-American men at the hands of white police officers. New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker and Minnesota Rep. Keith Ellison, both African-American, and Illinois Rep. Luis Gutierrez, who is Latino, offered testimony during the hearing on the ways in which an uneven application of the law has impacted their respective racial communities. Each Democrat punctuated their testimony with stories of their own encounters with discrimination. But Cruz, in opening remarks before those three panelists spoke, highlighted school choice — a phrase typically used by conservatives to connote the expansion of charter school programs — as a key civil rights issue. ""When it comes to civil rights, I think there is no civil right more important than the right of every child to access a quality education,"" Cruz said. ""And in my view, the most compelling civil rights issue of the 21st century is the the need to expand school choice and educational options so that every child, regardless of race ... has a fair opportunity to receive an excellent education."" He said while school choice hasn't been a focus of the subcommittee, he hopes it will be during the next two years, when he'll take over the gavel. Though charter school programs have drawn many critics, who believe they siphon needed funds and resources away from public schools, they've also earned some bipartisan support. Proponents of the policy tout their ability to provide low-income and minority students access to better educational opportunities than they might otherwise have in their own neighborhoods.","Texas Sen.

"(CNN) -- The No. 2 leader in a Marxist guerrilla group that has been at war with the Colombian government since the 1960s has been killed in a military raid, President Juan Manuel Santos said Thursday. Victor Julio Suarez Rojas, also known as Jorge Briceno Suarez and by his nom de guerre Mono Jojoy, was the military leader for the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, commonly called the FARC. Firefights between the military and the FARC continued into Thursday night, Defense Minister Rodrigo Rivera told CNN en Español. Rivera called the site where the military raid took place ""the mother of all FARC camps."" The camp was 300 meters (1,000 feet) long and had a bunker reinforced with concrete in the middle, he said. There were 13 satellite camps around the main camp, he said. So far, authorities recovered 20 computers, 68 USB drives and three external hard drives that could hold valuable intelligence for authorities, Rivera said. At the camp, troops also found four tons of fresh food. Santos called the rebel leader's death a ""historic"" event. ""This is the biggest blow the FARC has suffered in its history,"" Santos said from New York, where he is participating in meetings of the United Nations General Assembly. ""To the rest of the FARC, we are going after them,"" Santos said. ""We are not going to rest."" Santos said that some 20 others were killed in the raid, but later Rivera clarified that by saying as of Thursday night, only seven bodies had been recovered. The army reported that another top rebel leader, Henry Castellanos, alias Romana, was also killed but later retracted the statement. The defense ministry will wait until all of the bodies are examined before confirming whether any other leaders were killed. ""The nightmare that he wanted to impose on Colombia is ended,"" Santos said in a later speech. Suarez was a symbol of cruelty and inhumanity, he said. Details of the intelligence that led to the operation was not disclosed, but Rivera said that there would be a reward handed out in connection with the death of Suarez. The guerrilla leader was killed near the town of Macarena, in the southwestern Colombia state of Meta. The final operation against Suarez started early Wednesday, Rivera said, adding that officials had spent two sleepless nights awaiting the results. Five Colombian soldiers were wounded in the operation,which included heavy airstrikes, Rivera said at a news conference from Bogota, the nation's capital. The guerrilla leader's death was the FARC's second major setback in the past few days. An airstrike over the weekend killed a high-ranking rebel commander who was wanted in the United States, police said. Sixto Antonio Cabana Guillen was among the more than two dozen guerrillas killed in a Colombian air force bombing operation Sunday, the National Police said Monday. The U.S. State Department had been offering a reward of up to $2.5 million for information leading to his arrest or conviction. Cabana, as a top member of the FARC, helped set policies directing and controlling the production and distribution of hundreds of tons of cocaine to the United States and the world, according to a statement on the State Department's website. Speaking at Thursday's news conference in Bogota, Rivera urged FARC leader Guillermo Leon Saenz, known as Alfonso Cano, to surrender. ""We guarantee your life,"" Rivera said. ""We guarantee just treatment."" Regardless, Rivera vowed, the war against the FARC will continue. ""They have robbed us of nearly 50 years as a nation,"" he said. ""We are going to end the narco-terrorist FARC nightmare."" Suarez, who was believed to be 47, joined the FARC as a teenager and rose through the ranks to become commander of one of the rebels' seven fighting divisions. He became a top commander in the early 1990s, when he was appointed as one of the FARC's seven-member general secretariat. He eventually became the FARC's military commander in chief. Although he was considered the No. 2 person in the rebel group, Suarez had much more military experience and time served in the FARC than its leader, Cano, who was appointed to the general secretariat as the result of a deal with the Colombian communist party. In recent years, Suarez had been in charge of holding significant prisoners and kidnap victims in jungle camps. He also was in direct command of units responsible for the deaths of three Americans in 1999. He was under indictment in the United States for those deaths as well as drug-trafficking charges. Suarez also was the first FARC commander to order in the late 1980s or early 1990s that the rebels collect a tax from peasant farmers on coca plant cultivation. That, analysts say, marked the start of the FARC's wholesale involvement in drug trafficking. CNN's Karl Penhaul contributed to this report.","Army retracts claim that another leader was also killed .

"Beirut, Lebanon (CNN) -- Hezbollah's chief on Monday announced the group's new ""manifesto,"" which calls on all countries to ""liberate Jerusalem"" and declares the United States a threat to the world. ""American terrorism is the source of every terrorism in the world,"" Hassan Nasrallah said in a televised speech from an undisclosed location. It was his first address since a unity government formed in Lebanon this month, ending a crisis that had left the country with no government since June's parliamentary elections. Hezbollah, a political party in Lebanon, is listed as a terrorist organization by the United States and Israel. Nasrallah does not appear in public amid concerns for his safety. ""We invite and call on all Arabs and Muslims and all countries keen on peace and stability in the world to intensify efforts and resources to liberate Jerusalem from Zionist occupation and to maintain its true identity and its Islamic and Christian sanctities,"" Nasrallah said. Hezbollah has claimed responsibility for numerous terrorist attacks. It has been linked to attacks against against American, Israeli and other Western targets. In his remarks, which included about 80 minutes of reading the manifesto followed by answering questions from reporters, Nasrallah sought to reject the ""terrorist"" label, repeatedly saying Hezbollah is a ""resistance"" force. ""The U.S. administration under President George W. Bush equated the concepts of terrorism and resistance to deny the right of resistance for the people,"" he argued. He praised Iran and Syria, which are Hezbollah's chief backers. ""Iran plays a central role in the Muslim world"" and ""stood with courage and determination with Arab and Islamic issues, especially the Palestinian issue,"" Nasrallah said. ""Damascus stood with and supported the resistance's movements in the conflict. We emphasize the need to adhere to the distinguished relations between Lebanon and Syria,"" he added. A battle to end Syria's occupation of Lebanon led to protests and confrontations in the streets in 2005, which was labeled the Cedar Revolution. Syria eventually withdrew its troops from the country.

Nasrallah also called for Palestinians in Lebanon to ""be given basic human rights which at the same time protect their identity and their cause."" Under Lebanese law, Palestinian refugees have no social and civil rights, limited access to public health or educational facilities, and no access to public social services, according to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency. ""The majority rely entirely on UNRWA as the sole provider of education, health and relief and social services,"" the agency says on its Web site. ""Considered as foreigners, Palestine refugees are prohibited by law from working in more than 70 trades and professions.

"Washington (CNN) -- When U.S. President Barack Obama said Monday it would be wrong to seek regime change in Libya by force, Republican lawmakers took issue -- saying removing Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi is and should be precisely the goal. Gadhafi must have been comforted to hear the president's words, Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona, said following Obama's televised address. ""If we tell Gadhafi, 'Don't worry, you won't be removed by force,' I think that's very encouraging to Gadhafi,"" McCain said, after Obama delivered a speech explaining U.S. intervention in Libya. McCain said the president's words were ""puzzling"" because Obama has previously said that U.S. policy is for Gadhafi's ouster. ""The reason why we wage wars is to achieve the results of a policy that we state,"" McCain said. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina, agreed with McCain, his felllow member of the Senate Armed Services Committee. ""The goal of this country is to replace Gadhafi,"" Graham told CNN. Overall, however, McCain said Obama made a ""strong case"" for the military effort in Libya and laid out the reasons why the president thought it was important to intervene. Democrat Bill Richardson, a former governor of New Mexico who served as the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, said he was satisfied with the speech. Richardson told CNN that Obama said the purpose of the military mission is to avert a humanitarian disaster, to protect civilian lives, and to prevent a refugee crisis in neighboring Tunisia and Egypt. He said Obama probably should have called more members of Congress before deciding to join the military effort, but he pointed out this is not a war but a limited military engagement. ""He explained the objective and he explained what he wants to do,"" Richardson said. Republicans disagreed. Sen. Olympia Snowe, R-Maine, a senior member of the Senate Select Committee of Intelligence, and Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, R-Florida, both said the president failed to explain the extent of U.S. involvement and when that will end. House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, also said the president's speech failed to provide much clarity. ""Nine days into this military intervention, Americans still have no answer to the fundamental question: What does success in Libya look like?"" said Boehner spokesman Michael Steel. Boehner sent a letter to Obama last week in which he asked specific questions about the Libya mission, including whether the U.S. military would take on a larger role if the coalition fell apart. The House speaker also complained that the nine days it took for Obama to lay out the reasons for U.S. involvement was ""a long time,"" according to Steel. Former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, a former Republican presidential candidate, said Obama's speech didn't just fail to clarify the mission but ""made things even murkier than they were before."" ""The president says our mission is to protect the people of Libya,"" Giuliani said. ""Well, how do you protect the people of Libya and not be for regime change in Libya? Isn't the danger for the people of Libya Gadhafi?"" He added, ""The president of the United States did not define a clear goal. He didn't tell us what success is. He can't, because he's contradicting himself. You know what success is? Success is removing Gadhafi. He just doesn't want to say that."" Republican Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, a Tea Party favorite and possible 2012 presidential contender, said intervening in Libya is not in the national interest. In a response to the speech, posted on YouTube, the freshman senator asked, ""What imminent threat did Ghadafi or Libya pose to the United States?"" Rep. Emanuel Cleaver, D-Missouri, the chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus, said he was pleased with the president's announcement that the United States will transfer command of the mission to NATO on Wednesday, and that the United States will take a supporting role in the effort. ""We cannot afford another Iraq or Afghanistan, and I firmly believe that the president fully understands that,"" he said. Cleaver added he doesn't personally support the military engagement in Libya but understands Obama acted to prevent a ""potential genocide"" in the country. One congressman, Rep. Bruce Braley, D-Iowa, pointed out Obama made no mention of the cost of the mission, which both Democrats and Republicans have sought. Braley sent a letter to Obama last week asking for a full accounting of the Libyan conflict and the pricetag and said the president's speech Monday night provided no answers. ""I'm concerned, and I know many Americans are concerned, that tonight we didn't get a clear and accurate accounting from the president on how much this conflict in Libya is going to cost American taxpayers,"" Braley said in a statement after the speech. ""We've got two wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and Americans deserve to hear from our president what this third conflict is going to cost us."" Braley said he plans to meet with Defense Secretary Robert Gates and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton later this week and will press them on both the costs of the mission and ""their strategy for moving forward in Libya."" The United States has already fired close to 200 Tomahawk missiles in Libya. The cost of that alone is between $250 million and $300 million. By some estimates, it costs about $10,000 an hour to keep a U.S. fighter jet in the air, and U.S. jets have flown nearly 1,000 sorties, many of which last five or six hours. Some have estimated the costs of the Libya mission could reach $1 billion. Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Indiana, has also called for a full accounting of the costs. Graham took issue with those seeking clarification on the costs of the mission, saying the cost of not acting -- ""instability forever"" and large spikes in the price of oil for both the United States and its allies -- is far greater. CNN's Dana Bash, Deirdre Walsh, and Chris Lawrence contributed to this report .","NEW: Richardson says he was satisfied with the president's remarks .

"Investigators say it was a hate crime when a gunman opened fire at two Kansas City-area Jewish centers. But the three people he killed were Christian. That shouldn't affect whether authorities file hate crime charges against him, legal experts say. That's because federal hate crime statutes criminalize offenses involving ""actual or perceived"" race, color, religion, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity or disability of any person. ""To qualify as a hate crime, all that matters is that the crime was motivated, in whole or in part, by the offender's bias,"" CNN Legal Analyst Sunny Hostin said. ""The fact that both shootings occurred at places identifiable as Jewish, combined with his white supremacist past, plus any comments he made ... and other evidence would be more than enough to qualify this as a hate crime,"" she said. The suspect, Frazier Glenn Cross, 73, faces charges of first-degree murder. Organizations that track hate groups describe Cross, who is also known as Frazier Glenn Miller, as a long-time white supremacist. At a news conference on Monday, Overland Park Police Chief John Douglass said that investigators had ""unquestionably determined...that this was a hate crime."" And Barry Grissom, U.S. attorney for the District of Kansas, said federal prosecutors would be filing hate crime charges against him. ""We are in a very good place from an evidence standpoint of moving forward with this case,"" Grissom told reporters, ""and it will be presented to the grand jury in the not too distant future."" Richard Cohen, president of the Southern Poverty Law Center, said there's no doubt that the suspect's anti-Semitism fueled the shooting. ""Miller, of course, targeted them because he perceived them to be Jewish. That seems pretty obvious from the site of the shootings,"" he told CNN's Wolf Blitzer. Another indication of his mindset, Cohen said, were the words he shouted from the back of the patrol car after his arrest: ""Heil Hitler.""

"(CNN) -- It was the kind of phone call military families dread receiving from Iraq and Afghanistan -- not from Texas. Peggy McCarty's daughter called Thursday afternoon to say she had been wounded by a gunshot in her left shoulder. Keara Bono, 21, assured her mother that she was OK, but McCarty's heart skipped. She knew she had much to fear when Bono, an Army specialist, arrived at Fort Hood to prepare for an early December deployment to Iraq. But McCarty never thought she would have to worry about her child getting wounded on American soil. ""I thought I was more worried about her going over to Iraq than here, just doing training in Texas. She just got there yesterday,"" McCarty told CNN affiliate KSHB-TV in Kansas City, Missouri. Bono was one of 30 people hurt when a soldier opened fire on a military processing center at Fort Hood, the place where soldiers report before they head to war. They get medical and dental checkups there. They settle finances and even make out their wills. Thursday, the center turned into a killing field, and 13 lives were abruptly cut short. America watched in horror the news of the shootings, the deadliest ever on a military base. Some of the victims, such as Bono, were preparing to head to Iraq or Afghanistan. They were felled instead in the place they called home. When the shouts of ""Shots fired! Shots fired!"" started, one soldier pushed and shoved people to get out the back of the readiness center. And run. The soldier, who did not want to be identified, heard more screaming. Soldiers were dragging bodies away from the shooter. They snatched tablecloths off tables, cut up their own sage-green digital combat uniforms, even their tan undershirts, and turned them into tourniquets and pressure bandages. Everyone tried to render CPR and medical aid. Some were medical personnel. Others were simply friends helping friends. They were soldiers, after all, and trained as combat lifesavers, though they could not have imagined having to use their skills at home. But soldiers never abandon wounded comrades on the battlefield. Most of the injured were awake and alert, witnesses recalled. They just weren't talking. About a mile away at Darnall Army Medical Center, Army medic Spc. Eric Blohm waited for mass casualties. If the emergency rooms filled up, Darnall would put victims in rooms where usually babies are brought into the world. It felt too much like Blohm's tour of Iraq. ""I'm pretty shocked and bewildered,"" he told CNN's Anderson Cooper. ""Going to war and experiencing combat overseas and then ... to have your sense of security shattered, that's just kind of unreal."" Watch Blohm describe the scene . The shooting suspect, Maj. Nidal Malik Hasan, was a psychiatrist who had an office at Darnall. Now, the hospital was taking in the doctor's alleged victims. Sirens, installed after the September 11, 2001, attacks, sound routinely at Fort Hood during emergency drills. Pam Stephenson, the wife of a Judge Advocate General officer, was used to the blaring noise. Early afternoon, she was about to make a quick trip to the grocery with Megan, her 5-year-old who stayed at home sick on Thursday. But then she heard the whirring of choppers overhead and warnings on the loudspeakers: ""Take cover. Stay away from windows. Lock your doors."" Her husband called and told her not to leave the house. She turned on the television and learned the grim news. The gunman, she discovered, was a soldier. ""When you hear it's soldiers gone crazy -- you don't know what kind of ammunition or guns they have,"" she said. She wanted to fetch Patrick, 2, stuck at day care, but the sprawling post was under lockdown. No one knew then if there were killers on the loose. The streets were deserted. A mass of cars, waiting to get out, piled up at the gates. Loved ones waited on the other side, desperate for news of their soldiers. Stephenson checked Facebook and read a message from a military friend serving overseas. Deployed soldiers from Fort Hood were in a panic not knowing whether their families were safe. She checked on the soldier's wife and worried about Patrick. Finally, at 7:15, she was able to see her baby. Many miles away in Punta Gorda, Florida, Roxanne Johnson was chitchatting with her son, Justin, on the phone. He was a young track vehicle mechanic who was heading to Afghanistan come January. Mother and son joked and laughed, like they always did. And then she heard a strange noise: ""Dosh, dosh, dosh."" What was that? she wondered. ""At first I thought he was just kidding around and turning up the video game, and then I said, well, maybe it's a training exercise,"" Johnson told CNN affiliate WINK News in Fort Myers, Florida. She pressed the phone to her ear and listened. She heard the screams and the crying. Wow, she thought. It sounds so real. Her son's voice was gone. She refused to hang up until she could hear Justin again. She heard people shuffling about and muffled voices. Where was Justin? Had he been hurt? What was going on? ""Justin, call home!"" she said aloud. Hours passed before Johnson learned the fate of her son. He was one of the shooting victims. But Justin Johnson was one of the lucky ones. He underwent surgery and was recovering Thursday night. Roxanne Johnson breathed a sigh of relief and was able finally to disconnect her phone.","Parents worry about dangers overseas, not in Texas .

"If you were hoping to be done with winter, Punxsutawney Phil had some good news for you -- spring is on the way. After the groundhog was summoned from his burrow at the Gobbler's Knob hill in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, observers proclaimed that ""the prognosticator of all prognosticators"" had not seen his shadow. Meanwhile, at New York's Staten Island Zoo, fellow groundhog Staten Island Chuck also didn't see his shadow, agreeing that an early spring was on its way. But General Beauregard Lee, a Georgia groundhog, saw his shadow, signaling six more weeks of winter. Punxsutawney's celebration goes back 127 years. The tradition goes back to medieval times when there was a superstition that all hibernating animals emerged from their caves and dens to check the weather on Candlemas, which is halfway between the winter solstice in December and the vernal equinox in March. If the animals saw their shadows, winter would go on for another six weeks, and they could go back to sleep, according to the tradition. Much of the United States has seen extreme highs and lows in temperatures in recent weeks, taking folks from shorts and T-shirt weather to conditions that require heavy coats and gloves. Here's what Phil indicated in the last few years, according to Groundhog.org: . 2012: ""Many shadows do I see, six more weeks of winter it must be."" 2011: ""No shadow, spring is near!"" 2010: ""Phil saw his shadow and told his prediction to new Inner Circle President Bill Deeley."" 2009: ""Phil saw his shadow and Inner Circle President Bill Cooper completed his final interpretation and retired at Gobbler's Knob.

"Dallas (CNN) -- Hot, dry weather returns to Texas this week, whisking away the limited relief scattered thunderstorms brought to firefighters in parts of the Lone Star state over the weekend. In a trifecta of potentially bad news for fire crews, the Texas Forest Service said a low-pressure system will push temperatures into the 90s, humidity to 10% or less and winds up to 45 mph on Monday and Tuesday. The conditions have prompted the National Weather Service to issue a red flag warning for a large portion of west Texas, urging residents to avoid the use of open flames and to avoid activities that may generate sparks. Because of the hot temperatures, bone-dry conditions and high winds, ""accidental ignitions will have the potential to grow quickly into dangerous wind-driven wildfires,"" the weather service said. The system will bring with it a chance of precipitation. However, rain accompanied by thunderstorms can be a mixed-blessing for firefighters, since lightning can ignite new fires. One such fire scorched nearly every inch of a 10,000-acre north Texas ranch, about 70 miles west of Fort Worth. The Cormack family has raised cattle near Strawn for a quarter century, but now are coping with the loss of 15% of its herd and nearly all of its grazing land. ""Its something you can't really explain. This is home,"" Justin Comack told CNN's Patrick Oppmann.  ""I know a lot of people think ... it's just land, but you know this is my backyard and we ran cattle out here since I was a baby."" Some of the cattle were nearly incinerated by the fast-moving flames.  All Cormack can do is number the carcasses with green spray paint, take their pictures and log their GPS locations, hoping the family eventually will be compensated for its losses. Even for the surviving cattle, the road will be tough -- many suffered burns and may have to be put down. Grazing land has become a precious comodity, with most of the landscape charred following the fire. ""We've been really lucky that we have friends all over and people, strangers that come together and donate as much hay as they can,"" according to brother Jake Cormack, who said he's looking for grass leases to feed his herd until ""we can get over this hump."" The Forest Service responded to 17 new fires over the weekend, but the blazes were slowed by storms that brought softball-sized hail and reports of tornadoes. The largest of these new fires is the Pipeline fire in Tyler and Hardin counties.  Covering some 7,101 acres, it was caused by an oil well flare.  National Park Service personnel were involved in the fight against the blaze and it is now 90% contained. Wet weather over the past few days helped firefighters maintain control over many of the fires burning in the state, the Texas Forest Service said. The largest of them is the 207,660-acre Rockhouse fire in Jeff Davis County, which is 75% contained as of Sunday night.  Firefighters had to abandon the fight against the conflagration in the Davis mountains, according to an update from the Forest Service, because of concerns about safety and a lack of reliable communications.  The agency said the difficult terrain made use of bulldozers impossible and aerial resources had proved ineffective. The PK Complex of fires burning west of Fort Worth is now 50% contained, assisted by significant rainfall, the Forest Service said.  On Sunday, crews worked on constructing lines through the 126,734-acre fire.  The also burned pockets of vegetation around the fire's perimeter. The 159,308-acre Wildcat fire in Coke County, north of San Angelo, is 75% contained.  On Sunday, crews were able to focus on patrol and mop-up operations, according to the Texas Forest Service. West Texas averages nearly 15 inches of rain a year, according to David Hennig, a meteorologist in Midland. Over the past six months, just 13-hundredths of an inch of rain have been recorded in that part of the state. While October through March is typically the dry season, that amount of rainfall is far below what it should be, Hennig said. Two firefighters have died since the latest outbreaks began, with numerous others injured, state officials said.","NEW:  Fires scorch 10,000-acre ranch west of Fort Worth .

"The Washington Monument remains ""structurally sound"" and is ""not going anywhere,"" a top National Park Service official said Monday, announcing the result of a comprehensive assessment of the structure's interior. A five-day examination of the monument's exterior will begin Tuesday, according to Bob Vogel, superintendent of the National Mall and Memorial Parks. Four cracks in the monument's marble were discovered shortly after a 5.8-magnitude earthquake struck the East Coast on August 23.  The monument has since been closed to the public. Officials declined to say Monday when the monument will re-open. Small pools of standing water were found in the monument during inspections following Hurricane Irene, the National Park Service said in late August. ""What happened was a lot of mortar popped out, so much so that you can see sunlight above 450 feet in the monument,"" spokeswoman Carol Johnson said at the time. The National Park Service has been working with an engineering firm to determine the extent of the damage and what it will cost to fix it.  Repairs will include pinning several stones together and replacing some mortar, Johnson noted. The Washington Monument, built between 1848 and 1884, is 555 feet, 5 and one-eighth inches tall.  Its walls are 15 feet thick at the base and 18 inches at the top, and are composed primarily of white marble blocks, according to the National Park Service.","The Washington Monument is declared ""structurally sound""

"(CNN) -- The summer of 2011 was the second hottest on record for the United States, and the hottest in 75 years, government weather experts said Thursday. Louisiana, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Texas experienced their warmest summers ever, with several states seeing an average of more than 86 degrees, scientists with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said. For meteorological purposes, summer consists of the months of June, July and August. At least 22 people died as a result of the heat wave that swept the nation earlier this summer, according to the National Weather Service. For 15 states, the average temperature ranked among their top 10 warmest, while overall, 46 of the lower 48 states saw average to above-average temperatures. Oregon and Washington were the only exceptions. Texas had the distinction of experiencing the warmest summer on record of any state in America, with an average of 86.8 degrees. Dallas residents sweltered for 40 consecutive days of grueling 100-plus degree temperatures. Oklahoma, at 86.5, also topped the previous record, of 85.2 degrees, set in Oklahoma in 1934, amid what became known as the Dust Bowl. For the month of August, Arizona, Colorado, Louisiana, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Texas had their warmest in recorded history, while regionally, the Southwest and South also had their warmest August ever. Only nine of the lower 48 states saw August temperatures near their average readings, while none experienced below-average temperatures. Temperature-related energy demands soared more than 22% above the norm this summer, the largest increase since record-keeping of energy demands began more than a century ago, NOAA said. The persistently warm temperatures for the months of June through August, combined with below-average precipitation, also contributed to a record-breaking drought across the southern part of the United States. Texas was subjected to its driest summer ever, with a statewide average of only 2.44 inches of rain -- 5.29 inches below the long-term average, and more than an inch less than the previous driest summer in 1956. Neighboring Southwestern states New Mexico and Oklahoma were also drought-stricken, experiencing their second- and third-driest summers respectively. Conversely, New Jersey and California had their wettest summers ever. Meteorologists are predicting no immediate end in sight to the heat or drought afflicting the Southern states. NOAA announced Thursday that la nina, a naturally occurring climate phenomenon located over the tropical Pacific Ocean, is expected to strengthen and affect global weather patterns. Scientists attribute the extreme weather around the globe during the first half of 2011 to the weather event, and predict that the drought currently overtaking the states of Texas, New Mexico and Oklahoma is likely to persist. The extremely dry plains are a tinderbox for Texas; nearly 180 wildfires have been reported across the state in the past seven days, the Texas Forest Service Texas said. A large wildfire blazing outside Austin has destroyed nearly 1,400 homes and is not near containment.","National Weather Service: At least 22 deaths attributed to the summer heat wave .

"(CNN)Down syndrome, with all its promise and challenges, has never been more visible: Jamie Brewer, an actress with Down syndrome, just walked the catwalk at New York Fashion Week. A video of a girl with Down syndrome singing a John Legend song went viral, receiving 6 million page views and counting. People were so moved by the story of a father choosing his son with Down syndrome over his marriage that they donated over $500,000 to his care (although the father's story has now been called into question). The Down syndrome community, on a regular basis, inspires its members with stories about accomplishments, loving families and overcoming challenges. I love these stories and they make me happy. Somehow, though, their impact is limited. Despite the good press and the outpouring of support, when one's own child is diagnosed with Down syndrome, far too many people react with a toxic combination of fear and terror. Fortunately, there are antidotes: information, experts and community. Thanks to the power of the Internet and the commitment of activists, politicians and experts of all sorts, access to these antidotes has never been easier. Here's an example of the power of sharing information: . At about 7 a.m. one day last November, Claudia sent me a Facebook message about her best friend, Jane. (All names have been altered.) Jane was pregnant with twins, one of whom had been diagnosed with both Down syndrome and a heart defect. Jane and her spouse were stuck in that toxic panic and didn't know what to do.  Claudia wrote, ""They told me it's super easy to find adoptive parents because lots of people want kids with special needs. Right now, their plan is to leave the baby at the hospital, and failing that the fire station."" I was startled by the message, but not shocked. I'm the father of a boy with Down syndrome and had at least an inkling of what Jane was going through. On the other hand, although safe haven laws make leaving a child at the hospital legal, and American children with Down syndrome do often get adopted, this clearly wasn't the right way to go about it. So I told Claudia I'd be back shortly to help, got my own children safely off on the bus to school, and returned to my computer 40 minutes later. Soon, I was talking to Amy Allison, the executive director of the Down Syndrome Guild of Greater Kansas City. Fifteen minutes later, Amy had connected me to Stephanie Thompson, the co-director of the National Down Syndrome Adoption Network. Stephanie reached out to Claudia and from there to Jane. Over the next few weeks, Jane and her spouse started talking to potential adoptive parents, but also got plugged into all the resources for families of people with Down syndrome. Eventually, as the hazy fear of diagnosis burned off, and thanks to the couple's own desire to learn more, their perceptions changed. Jane has now given birth. One of her twins does indeed have Down syndrome. The new parents are keeping both children. Today, in Claudia's words, ""They're stressed out and scared but in love with their babies and looking forward to when the four can be home together."" Claudia and I may be Facebook friends, but we have never met and don't really know each other. It's amazing that this tenuous contact between us helped shift the outcome for Jane and her family. It points out a positive way in which the Internet has changed the experience of raising a child with special needs. The moment of diagnosis is terribly jarring, no matter when it takes place. It throws you from a world for which you thought you were preparing into some other strange place.  You grieve. You wall yourself off. While the circumstances of my son's diagnosis were different than Jane's, the hours and days after were very difficult. In fact, I've spoken to hundreds of parents about their experience, and we mostly all felt alone and afraid. In a previous era, Jane's story might have played out very differently. Access to basic information about Down syndrome was hard to come by, even from medical practitioners, and it was a challenge to make contact with experts and other parents.  Now, Jane and many like her can plug into a vibrant and informed community almost instantly. Whether it's parents of children with well-known disabilities, people dealing with rare diseases, or any other subset of humanity that has a hard time locating face-to-face community, it's far easier to connect on the Internet. Social media provides a highly mediated and algorithmically-driven commercial environment that at best mirrors real relationships. It's often criticized for destroying American family life.  But I feel lucky to have these communication tools at my disposal, even if I'm just sharing small struggles and tiny victories -- how to help with sleeping issues, the triumph of my son eating a scrambled egg for the first time in his life, or wondering how to make a haircut less traumatic for all involved. And sometimes, as with Jane, the stakes are much higher. These are the stories about Down syndrome that don't make news, and maybe that's OK, so long as people know that these networks exist. There are thousands, maybe tens of thousands, of people with and without disabilities ready to respond not with fear or judgment, but with information and empathy.","David Perry: When one's own child is diagnosed with Down syndrome, many people react with terror .

"To hear prosecutors tell it, Darrien Hunt lunged at officers with a ""samurai-type sword"" before he was killed. To hear his family tell it, police shot the 22-year-old several times while he was running away. An independent autopsy proves he was shot from behind, his family's attorney said. And while there's no consensus about what happened last Wednesday morning, the Utah case is already drawing comparisons to the police shooting death of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri. Hunt's mother said she believes race played a role in her son's death. ""They killed my son because he's black,"" Susan Hunt told CNN affiliate KSL. ""No white boy with a little sword would they shoot while he's running away."" But the Utah County Attorney's Office said there is ""currently no indication that race played any role in the confrontation between Mr. Hunt and the police officer."" ""Police officers from the Saratoga Springs Police Department responded to a report of a suspicious individual walking around a local business with a 'samurai-type' sword,"" Chief Deputy Tim Taylor of the prosecutor's office said in a statement. ""When the officers made contact with Mr. Hunt, preliminary evidence suggests that Mr. Hunt brandished the sword and lunged toward the officers with the sword, at which time Mr. Hunt was shot."" Hunt family attorney Randall Edwards challenged that version of events. An independent autopsy shows Hunt was shot six times from behind, Edwards told CNN. ""We are not going to release the independent autopsy results or the name of who performed it until the Utah State Medical Examiner releases its results,"" Edwards said. The claim that Hunt lunged at officers with the sword ""seems to be inaccurate,"" Edwards said, ""based on witnesses who saw him running from police officers and our independent autopsy."" The county attorney's office said the case is under investigation. Two officers have been placed on paid administrative leave while the shooting is investigated, KSL said. ""Rest assured that there is more to this story,"" police said in a statement on their Facebook page. ""Many of the details cannot yet be shared due to the ongoing investigation."" Hunt was arrested in January on several charges, including assault, child abuse and intoxication, according to county records. Edwards said that arrest had nothing to do with last week's shooting, and that Hunt had no history of interactions with the Saratoga Springs Police Department. The arrest came after a fist fight with one of Hunt's siblings, Edwards said, ""and since it was his first offense he was able to have it dropped from his record if he pleaded guilty to the charges."" ""We don't know exactly what happened, but the fact that a black kid with an Afro was shot while walking down the street by two white officers in a city that is 96% white is concerning,"" Edwards said. ""There are serious questions as to why officers were questioning him and the use of force in this situation."" While some have speculated that race played a role in the shooting deaths of Hunt and Brown, there's one key difference between the two cases: Brown was unarmed when he was shot, and Hunt was reportedly carrying a 3-foot sword around a Panda Express restaurant and other businesses. ""I believe that maybe my son thought, 'Maybe I'll try to get a job at Panda, maybe this sword will impress them,' "" Susan Hunt told KSL. She said that the sword was purchased at a local Asian gift shop and that it could not actually cut anything. In a statement Monday, Panda Restaurant Group spokesman Thien Ho said the Saratoga Springs location was closed at the time of the shooting. ""We do not have first-hand details of what occurred,"" Ho said. CNN legal analyst Sunny Hostin said the case, like the Brown shooting, highlights the issue of when police can use deadly force. Officers are justified in using deadly force, she said, to defend their lives or to stop a fleeing felon whose escape would pose a serious threat to the officer or to the public. ""So when I see this fact pattern where someone may have been shot in the back, that someone must have been committing a violent crime and pose a threat to society, the public, for that officer to be justified in shooting the person,"" Hostin said. ""These cases are very case and fact-specific. But it does seem to odd to me that, if he was running away with this fake sword, that  deadly force would be appropriate."" But there are other questions to consider, she said, including whether the sword looked fake. ""Maybe the sword looked to be a real sword,"" Hostin said. ""And was there a violent crime committed with that sword?""","Family's attorney: Autopsy shows he was shot six times from behind .

"Editor's note: This story originally appeared on CNN.com on October 20. Barack Obama mentioned Ann Nixon Cooper on Tuesday in his presidential victory speech. Ann Nixon Cooper, 106 years old, lived during a time when blacks and women did not have the right to vote. ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- Ann Nixon Cooper, 106 years old, has seen presidents come and go in her lifetime and has outlived most of them. On a sunny fall morning, she left her weathered but well-kept Tudor home in Atlanta, Georgia, to vote early -- this time for Barack Obama. The African-American centenarian remembers a time not long ago when she was barred from voting because of her race. Now she hopes to see the day that Obama is elected as the nation's first black president. ""I ain't got time to die,"" Cooper said with a smile. ""Even if he didn't win, I was happy for him just to be nominated,"" said the former socialite. ""The first black president -- isn't that something, at 106 years old?""  Watch Obama say 'Yes we can' » . At the Fulton County government center, Cooper was greeted by Atlanta Mayor Shirley Franklin. ""I thought that I would accompany her today to support her, but also to say to all people that this is a choice we have,"" Franklin said. ""As all Americans, we should cherish the right to vote and take every opportunity we have to vote our opinions. She is an inspiration to me personally, but she is also quite an inspiration to all Atlanta.""   Watch Cooper talk about her life and experiences » . Cooper, in a wheelchair and helped by two caretakers, bypassed the long lines of early voters and headed right to the voting machine. Her 106-year-old hands reached out to the 21st-century touch screen to cast her vote for Obama. Back at her home, surrounded by the elegance of a bygone era, Cooper clutched the photo albums laid out on her dining room table. The longtime socialite and community leader has called Atlanta home since the 1920s.  See images of Cooper's day » . She and her late husband, prominent dentist Dr. Albert Cooper, raised four children in this house. ""Our days and nights were just social affairs,"" she said. The home was a center of Atlanta's black society and the scene of many parties. Celebrities, including the late singer Nat King Cole, dropped in to visit. ""It's been a house with a heap of living going on in it,"" said Cooper. She wears a charm bracelet that former U.S. ambassador to the U.N. and Atlanta Mayor Andrew Young gave her when she turned 99. ""He adds a charm every year,"" said friend and caretaker Sally Warner. ""Andy says he will have to apply for a loan soon to keep up with Mrs. Cooper."" Cooper danced the electric slide up until the age of 103. She has recently slowed down after suffering several heart attacks and a fractured hip. On a typical day, Cooper spends hours watching television in her wood-paneled sitting room. ""Her favorite show is 'The Price is Right,' although she is getting used to Drew Carey as the new host,"" said Warner. Other favorite shows include ""Oprah"" and ""Dancing with the Stars."" When the weather is nice, Cooper spends afternoons on her screened porch, watching traffic go by and reminiscing about old times. Occasionally she leaves the house for an outing. Cooper was born in Shelbyville, Tennessee, in 1902. She grew up in Nashville with uncles and an aunt who worked as a domestic for wealthy whites. She married Albert Cooper in Nashville in 1922, and the couple moved to Atlanta. Three of Cooper's four children have died; her surviving daughter is 83. She has 14 grandchildren living and many great-grandchildren and great-great-grandchildren. When asked about the secret to her longevity, Cooper said, ""I don't know how it happened, but being cheerful had a lot to do with it. I've always been a happy person, a giggling person -- a wide-mouthed person!"" To young people, Cooper offers this advice: ""Keep smiling. No matter what, you get out and vote.

"Australia's environment minister has conceded that years of neglect have contributed to a devastating drop in coral coverage on the Great Barrier Reef along the country's north eastern coast. A report out Tuesday sounded what Tony Burke referred to as an ""alarm bell"" on the state of the reef, designated as a World Heritage Area and home up to 3,000 individual reefs and thousands of species of fish and mollusk. ""There's no doubt there's been a level of neglect for decades which if it had been dealt with otherwise we'd be in a much better situation now,"" Burke told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. The report, by the Australian Institute of Marine Science (AIMS) and the University of Wollongong, revealed that the reef had lost half its coral cover in the last 27 years. Published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, the report warned that if current trends continue, that coverage could halve again by 2022. ""Without intervention, the GBR may lose the biodiversity and ecological integrity for which it was listed as a World Heritage Area,"" it said. Scientists: To save Great Barrier Reef, kill starfish . Researchers say most of the damage was wrought in recent years by a succession of powerful cyclones. Waves crash down shallow reefs, dislodging pieces of coral that smash against others as they're thrown around by wind-whipped waters. ""An area that has been exposed to the eye of the cyclone can look like a rubble zone shortly after it's passed over. It can be really quite devastating,"" said Jamie Oliver, a research director with AIMS. ""It's been clearly shown from a number of studies that reefs that have been damaged by cyclones and other conditions can make a reasonably good recovery after 10 to 20 years,"" he said. ""The reef has the ability to regenerate from these impacts; we just need to make sure all the conditions are right for that to happen."" The problem on the Great Barrier Reef, the report says, is that it's facing other threats that are hindering its ability to recover. Run-off from agricultural industry along the Queensland coast has created fertile conditions for the crown-of-thorns starfish, or COTS. While the report attributed 48% of the coral loss to cyclones, 42% was blamed on the starfish, a native species which feeds on coral.  Another 10% was attributed to coral bleaching, which occurs when water becomes too warm. ""The recent frequency and intensity of mass coral bleaching are of major concern and are directly attributable to rising atmospheric greenhouse gases. To date, the GBR has lost fewer corals to bleaching and diseases than many other regions in the world, but bleaching mortality will almost certainly increase in the GBR, given the upward trend in temperatures,"" the report warned. ""We can't change the weather so storms and bleaching are something that will take a much more concerted action at an international level, however we may be able to do something about crown-of-thorns, either through direct action on the outbreaking populations or by doing things like improving water quality, which has been shown to have a link to causing outbreaks in the first place,"" Oliver said. According to researchers at James Cook University, there have been three major outbreaks of COTS since the 1960s and it's believed the start of another one is under way. ""If the current wave moves in a similar way we can expect starfish populations to progress throughout the central GBR over the next 10 years or so,"" wrote Jon Brodie, a senior principal research officer at JCU on The Conversation website in April. The current method of dealing with the outbreaks involves divers individually injecting the starfish with poison to kill them off one by one, an approach that researchers concede does not work over large areas. ""It has been shown in other countries that on a large scale attempting to save a reef system over hundreds of kilometers, there are just too many starfish once they're in full outbreaking mode for it to be economically effective,"" Oliver said. Instead, research is underway to find new methods to halt their march. Scientists are investigating the possibility of inducing a natural disease in starfish ""by injecting them with a nutrient broth that encourages a naturally-occurring pathogenic bacteria,"" Oliver said. However he conceded the theory needs much more work before it was a realistic option. Another alternative would be to lure the starfish away from certain areas. ""We know that they respond to chemical cues, it may be possible to use those chemical cues to trap starfish or to move them away from areas of particular sensitivity,"" he said. Five years ago, the federal government introduced its Reef Rescue Plan, $200 million program to reduce run-off from cattle grazing and sugarcane farms, which the environment minister said had a ""huge impact."" ""We've been upgrading their equipment and upgrading their technology and having a massive difference to the impact of how much chemical is going into the ground, and how much runoff as a result, is then going into the reef,"" Burke told the ABC. The World Wildlife Fund (WWF) is urging the Australian government to commit even more money -- half a billion dollars over seven years -- to allow the government to meet its own targets of completely eliminating fertilizer run-off by 2020. ""While these findings are deeply disturbing, with the right political will we can stop the march of crown-of-thorns starfish in its tracks and save the reef,"" said WWF-Australia spokesperson Nick Heath in a statement. ""Sixty thousand jobs in the tourism industry depend on us acting with urgency over the next few years,"" he added. The government has said that it's already started work on many of the recommendations contained in the report, and that its findings reinforce the need for action. ""Just as the economics of it are real, it's also true that even if the economics weren't there, we have in the Great Barrier Reef one of the standout assets for the planet and there's massive economic consequences associated with it,"" Burke said. ""But before you even get to that there's a responsibility that we have in managing it well and this report is a wake up call to anybody who thought we could just let things go as they were,"" he added.","Australian environment minister says report rings alarm bell for Great Barrier Reef .

"After signaling he was on the verge of delivering a strike against Syria, President Barack Obama made a last-minute decision Friday evening to seek congressional authorization before any military action, senior administration officials told reporters Saturday. The president announced the change in plans to his advisers at approximately 7 p.m. Friday, officials said. Obama had also come to the conclusion the United States should carry out a limited military strike to degrade Syria's chemical weapons capabilities, they added. After privately wrestling with the decision for the past week, the officials said, Obama took what was described as a 45-minute walk with Chief of Staff Denis McDonough around 6 p.m. Friday and then called his top national security advisers into the Oval Office for a discussion. Senior administration officials say a heated debate broke out over the president's decision. Those officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity and asked not to be quoted, declined to say which advisers initially disagreed with the call to seek congressional approval. The administration's national security team, those officials added, is now firmly behind the president. The president later telephoned Vice President Joe Biden, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel and Secretary of State John Kerry to relay his decision, officials said. Obama convened a ""principals meeting"" of his top national security and intelligence officials Saturday morning to finalize his decision. In addition to consulting with his top advisers, Obama also consulted with Gen. Martin Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who told the president a delay would not jeopardize a military strike against Syria, officials said. A senior administration official told CNN that Secretary of State  Kerry has ""no concerns"" about the president's decision. ""He was in the Senate for 29 years and has made consultation with Congress a huge priority since he became secretary of state. He has been on the front lines of briefing and consulting with Congress on every foreign policy issue from one end or the other for years."" A senior U.S. official indicated Hagel was with the president on the move. ""As a former senator whose views on the limits of war are well known, it's not hard for Chuck Hagel to agree with the president, "" the official told CNN. ""Hagel, a combat veteran with two Purple Hearts, has a pragmatic approach to the use of military force that involves the need to consider American public opinion. At the same time. Hagel believes that the use of force would be completely justified in the face of the reckless slaughter of innocent Syrian civilians,"" the official said. But the decision to wait and seek congressional authorization comes with some risk, officials conceded. A vote to approve a military mission in Syria could fail in Congress. There is also the uncertain reaction from Syria's President Bashar al-Assad. Senior administration officials, who accuse al-Assad of gassing rebel fighters along with innocent civilians, said the Syrian leader should think twice before taking any drastic action. The president, those officials cautioned, would hold al-Assad accountable. Senior administration officials rejected the notion the president's decision to seek congressional authorization undermines decades of entrenched executive branch powers to take military action. Asking lawmakers for approval, the White House argues, would strengthen the president's position diplomatically. Officials insisted the legislative branch is also responsible for holding al-Assad accountable for his alleged use of poison gas, noting Congress ratified an international chemical weapons convention in 1997. To bolster their case to members of Congress, White House officials plan to make available classified materials from the administration's intelligence report on the August 21 attack around Damascus. National security officials released an unclassified version of that assessment Friday. Congressional leaders, senior administration officials maintained, were supportive of the president's decision to ask for approval from Capitol Hill. A top legislative aide, who also spoke on the condition of anonymity, questioned the confidence of White House officials in the outcome of any vote. ""It's going to take a lot of work from (the president) to sell it. It's all on him,"" the aide said.","Kerry has ""no concerns"" about the Obama decision .

"Tokyo (CNN) -- A farmer's farewell, etched in white chalk, is echoing menacingly through Japan's agricultural sector. ""Wish there was no nuclear power plant. My endurance has come to an end,"" the note says. The farmer, in his 50s, then killed himself on the land he struggled to maintain since Japan's tsunami and nuclear crisis began. The dairy farmer's suicide message was left on the wall of one of the man's barns, members of a local farming bureau said. The man also apologized to his family and friends in the note. Hiroyuki Ebihara, a member of a local chapter of Japan Agricultural Cooperatives, said he knew the farmer personally and tried to check in with him after the March 11 disaster. On June 11, Ebihara says, members of his group found the farmer's body. ""The situation here is depressing for everyone,"" says Ebihara. ""We are all in the same situation. Our future with daily farming is unclear, especially since we don't know what the compensation will be. We want TEPCO (Tokyo Electric Power Company) or the government to come out with a clear plan for compensation."" The man had fled Japan with his family to the Philippines after the earthquake and tsunami. He returned to the farm after 10 days to care for his cows. The farmer's family remained in the Philippines until this week when they returned for the man's funeral. He leaves behind a wife and two children, Ebihara says. The agricultural sector of Soma -- the farmer's region -- has been deeply impacted by the nuclear crisis at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant. Japan's government stopped milk shipments from the region in the wake of the nuclear meltdown at the plant. The government lifted the milk ban on April 21, but consumers have been reluctant to purchase dairy products produced near the plant. A 64-year-old vegetable farmer from Sukagawa City in Fukushima Prefecture also committed suicide in the wake of agricultural bans in the ongoing nuclear crisis. The vegetable farmer hanged himself on March 24, one day after the government issued a ban on Fukushima prefectural vegetables.","The region of Soma has been deeply impacted by the nuclear crisis .

"""It breaks my heart to think how many people would not have chosen to keep that precious angel."" -- Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi, speaking about abortion and Down syndrome at the 2012 National Convention. ""I highly approve of (Mitt) Romney's decision to be kind and gentle to the retard."" -- Ann Coulter, tweeting about the third presidential debate. ""No one would call someone with Down syndrome 'retard.' I call you a 'retard.' "" -- Coulter on Alan Colmes' Fox News Radio show. Let's pretend that Ann Coulter is telling the truth in that last comment.  Yes, she called President Barack Obama a retard, but at least she claimed she'd never insult someone with Down syndrome. Even if she's lying, we have come a long way. Children with Down syndrome still get bullied or even abused, and adults with any disability face an uncertain future, particularly in an era of austerity, but today few would call someone with Down syndrome a retard to his or her face. For this, as the father of a boy with Down syndrome, I am grateful. In fact, over the last 50 years or so, the lives of people with Down syndrome and other disabilities have improved in many remarkable ways. Most parents are now raising their children with Down syndrome in their homes rather than sending them to live in institutions. Government programs, especially through early intervention and special education, employ teachers and therapists who have helped these children learn beyond our wildest dreams. Medical advances not only prevent many of the most dire threats to their health but begin to promise new treatments to make it easier for them to learn. Extended families, churches, community groups and nonprofits all work to support families such as mine. And sometimes, when relatives or church members or kind strangers meet my son or hear that I have a boy with Down syndrome, they smile and tell me that ""people with Downs"" or ""Downs kids"" are God's angels sent down to earth. I smile and thank them and agree that people with Down syndrome can be pretty great. But while good intentions count for a lot, ""angel"" makes me no happier than ""retard."" Most parents who have spent time changing diapers, dealing with tantrums or trying to get a sleepy child, with or without Down syndrome, ready for the school bus in time know that ""angel"" doesn't always cut it. People talk about Down syndrome ""special angels"" or ""hidden angels"" across the Internet and media. Reece's Rainbow Adoption Ministry, an organization that does spectacular work finding homes for orphan children with Down syndrome, has an ""angel tree"" on its website, with pictures of children in need of adoption.  The founder writes, ""The beauty and innocence that a child with Down syndrome brings to the world is truly one of Divine nature.""  This is a little more complex than ""angel,"" but the focus on innocence points in the same direction. Ann Coulter's backward use of the 'r-word' No human, including my son, is entirely innocent or angelic. Symbols, labels and representations -- in media, literature and our daily conversations -- shape reality. The words ""retard"" and ""angel"" represent images that dehumanize and disempower.  Both words connote two-dimensional, simple or limited people. Neither angels nor retards can live in the world with the rest of us, except as pets, charity cases or abstract sources of inspiration. I am delighted to see the tide turn against the ""r-word."" After Coulter tweeted about the president, John Franklin Stephens, a man with Down syndrome, took to the Internet and to CNN.  He argued  that comparing the president to people such as him ought to be a ""badge of honor"" given the pathways he has forged through life's complex problems.  The wave of support and publicity received by Stephens gives me hope for my son and for all of us who think our lives are improved by a society that includes everybody. Language changes as knowledge and attitudes change. Doctors started using the word ""retarded"" to replace ""Mongoloid Idiot.""  A lot of good came with that shift, because it indicated a new understanding that people with Down syndrome were not monstrously limited creatures best locked up in an institution. Today, we talk about ""developmentally delayed,"" and a lot of good has come with that shift, too. People see a child with developmental delays as having the potential to learn, to grow, to develop and to become a self-advocate. And even Coulter, as a result, claims she would never call my son a retard. But other words will replace it.  People will find new ways to use language to divide, to objectify and to dehumanize. The issue isn't language, not specific words, but representation. My son is neither angel nor monster, just human. It's true that he's more confident in the world of empathy than of language. He reflects and intensifies the emotions of those around him. He meets love with even more love. These traits can be wonderful, and they're pretty typical of people with Down syndrome. But complex emotional lives define us as human, not angelic. So let's listen to the rueful laughs of so many of my fellow parents who insist: ""My child is no angel."" Let's stand with Stephens as we fight against hate speech. Let's include people with developmental disabilities fully into our society. Most of all, let's always think of people with Down syndrome as people, first, not syndromes. Then the cruel words employed by clownish bigots will vanish into historical memory.","Ann Coulter's ""retard"" comment not aimed at Down syndrome, she said .

"(CNN) -- White sand beaches, tropical rain forests and colorful coral reefs -- southern Mexico would appear to have it all. Hurricane Dean hits Mexico in August last year. Experts argue hurricanes are worsening due to human activity. But it seems that this area of outstanding natural beauty is also unusually susceptible to danger in the form of costly -- both human and financial -- natural disasters. This year alone two maximum strength hurricanes passed over the Yucatan peninsula, while extreme floods in the Tabasco and Chiapas regions in October affected half of the region's 2.2 million inhabitants and drew comparisons with the havoc created in the U.S. by Hurricane Katrina. Both hurricanes and the flood were natural phenomena but scientists and environmental campaigners argue that the force of these devastating disasters is exacerbated by human activity. The north Atlantic has always been prone to hurricanes. Each season, meteorologists expect the Caribbean and the Gulf of Mexico to experience between 10 and 20 tropical storms between May and the end of November. But in recent years it has been the intensity of these storms that has surprised analysts. In 2005 there were 15 storms classified as hurricanes, seven of which were considered 'major', or category 3 or more according to the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. Some scientists believe this escalation in intensity is down to global warming. ""Both observation and theory suggest that hurricanes are becoming more intense as the earth warms,"" says Kevin Trenberth, Head of the Climate Analysis Section at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colorado. A number of ingredients are required to form a hurricane. One of the key components is a sea surface temperature greater than 26 degrees Celsius. Records show that sea temperatures in the band of the north Atlantic where most hurricanes occur have risen significantly since 1994. A rise or fall in surface sea temperature can change a storm's intensity by an entire category, according to Dr Trenberth. Some scientists have attributed this rise in sea temperature to a natural cycle of warming and cooling known as the Atlantic multidecadal oscillation. But tests run on computer models at the National Center for Atmospheric Research, where all possible contributing factors can be added or eliminated, conclude that the recent warming of the sea can be related to the dumping of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Dr Trenberth believes that the increasing intensity of hurricanes will conversely result in less storms per year -- a hurricane cools the sea so that there is less likelihood of further storms forming in its wake -- but that the storms that do form will be much more devastating and much more likely to cost human lives. ""Sooner or later [a storm like Hurricane Katrina is] going to happen again,"" says Dr Trenberth. ""It's only a matter of time -- it's quite easy to avoid these storms by chance for a while but sooner or later it will happen again."" Tabasco and Chiapas caught the tail end of one of these storms -- Noel. But the main cause of the floods was two cold fronts which sat over the Gulf of Mexico for several days in late October and early November. The heavy rain caused the Grijalva, La Sierra, Carrizal and Puxcatan rivers to break their banks, leaving 80 percent of the state of Tabasco under water, 13 people dead and 240 still missing. The Federal Government estimates that half of the region's 2.2 million people were directly affected. Global warming is partly responsible for the disaster, according to Jorge Escandón, co-ordinator of Greenpeace Mexico's energy and climate change campaign. ""At the moment, what we know about hydro-meteorological events is that there will be a major event with major intensity. We have already been told that by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and there are also various Mexican scientists who have modeled these scenarios."" But aside from climate change, Escandón also believes that Mexico's government knew that the state of Tabasco was at risk and did not do enough to prepare for such a scenario. ""The fact is that the government of Mexico published a document on the subject of climate change in 1997 in which the state of Tabasco was singled out as being particularly vulnerable to extreme rainfall. ""You have this since 1997 and the ideal would have been that a degree of adaptation would have taken place. It all suggests a lack of infrastructure."" Escandón believes that the damage in Tabasco and Chiapas could have been considerably minimized, firstly through long-term measures to reduce global warming but also through more immediate actions. Other human activities also played their part in causing the floods. Deforestation meant that there were not enough trees to soak up surface water, while the Integral Project Against Flooding, set up in 2003 after similarly devastating flood hit the region in 1999, with the intention of building levees and drainage canals along the Grijalva, Carrizal and Samaria rivers was never finished. Some newspaper reports have highlighted accusations by lawmakers of government corruption, with state officials unable to say where some of the money earmarked for flood prevention has gone. ""The problem of Tabasco is that corruption continues reigning,"" Francisco Sanchez Ramos, a federal congressman who represents Tabasco, told the LA Times. ""Without doubt, this tragedy could have been avoided."" If scientists' predictions play out, this corner of paradise will increasingly experience situations such as the Tabasco floods. This year Mexico emerged relatively unscathed from the hurricane season -- Ivan and Dean passed over relatively unpopulated areas -- but it seems it is only a matter of time before tragedy strikes again, be it in the form of storms or heavy rains. The government of Mexico will have to show initiative and prepare for such occurrences if they do not want to be responsible for the loss of lives.

"An Indian woman whose gang-rape aboard a bus in New Delhi spawned mass protests has died, according to a doctor who was treating her at a Singapore hospital. The woman, 23, ""passed away peacefully"" at 4:45 a.m. Saturday (3:45 p.m. ET Friday), with her family and Indian officials at her side, Dr. Kelvin Loh, chief executive officer at Mount Elizabeth Hospital, said in a statement. The woman had been in ""extremely critical condition"" since being admitted Thursday to the Singapore hospital, and Loh had said Friday that she'd ""taken a turn for the worse."" ""She had suffered from severe organ failure following serious injuries to her body and brain,"" Loh said. ""She was courageous in fighting for her life for so long against the odds, but the trauma to her body was too severe for her to overcome."" Authorities haven't released the name of the rape victim, but Indian protesters are calling her Damini, which means ""lightning"" in Hindi. ""Damini"" also is a 1993 Bollywood film whose lead female character fights for a housemaid, a victim of sexual assault. T.C.A. Raghavan, India's ambassador to Singapore, said the family wants its privacy protected. He said they are Hindu and from New Delhi. ""It's been a very trying and difficult time for them,"" he said of the late woman's family. ""They are in the process of getting in touch with all their relatives and deciding the next steps."" Read more: India gang-rape victim in Singapore for treatment; new protests hit New Delhi . Attackers assaulted the woman and her male companion on a bus December 16, robbing them of their belongings before dumping them at the side of a road, police said. Six suspects are now under arrest, including the bus driver and a minor. The male companion was eventually discharged from a hospital, but the female victim's condition deteriorated as she spent days in intensive care, battling for her life. Police said last Saturday that she had recovered enough to give a statement to a magistrate from her hospital bed the night before. But on Sunday, she underwent another surgery to wash out infection in her abdomen, her doctors said. The death spurred an outpouring of sadness in social media, as well as calls for action to ensure her rapists are punished and that Indian society changes so that more women aren't assaulted, harassed and otherwise mistreated because of their gender. ""'Damini' (is) just a name now,"" famed Bollywood actor Amitabh Bachchan wrote on Twitter. ""Her body has passed away, but her soul shall ... forever stir our hearts !!!"" Prime Minister Manmohan Singh offered his ""deepest condolences"" early Saturday upon learning of the woman's death, and said ""it is up to us all to ensure that her death will not have been in vain."" ""We have already seen the emotions and energies this incident has generated,"" he said, referring to widespread protests calling for justice and reforms since the December 16 attack. ""These are perfectly understandable reactions from a young India and an India that genuinely desires change. ""It would be a true homage to her memory if we are able to channel ... these emotions and energies into a constructive course of action."" Reported rape cases in India -- where a cultural stigma keeps many victims from reporting the crime -- have increased drastically over the past 40 years from 2,487 in 1971 to 24,206 in 2011, according to official figures. New Delhi alone had 572 rapes reported last year and more than 600 in 2012. One such recent case involved a 17-year-old girl who claimed she'd been gang-raped during the Hindu festival of Diwali on November 13, though a formal case wasn't registered by police until 14 days later. She committed suicide Wednesday by ingesting poison, according to Paramjit Singh Gill, the inspector-general of police in the Patiala district of Punjab, in northern India. In her suicide note, the teenager blamed her alleged rapists. Three suspects -- including a female accomplice -- have since been arrested, Gill said. Seema Sirohi, of the Indian Council on Global Relations, said most women in Indian have stories of sexual harassment and abuse on public transportation, on the streets, and elsewhere. Regardless of how a woman dresses, ""You are still open season for men."" ""There are a lot of reasons why this happens, but the patriarchal system is one, a lack of policing is another, and general treatment of women is not equal to men, even though it may be so under the law,"" Sirohi said.

"Gaza City (CNN) -- An Italian humanitarian activist and journalist who was kidnapped in Gaza has been found dead and one person is in custody, the Hamas Interior Ministry said Friday in a statement. Police investigating the case learned where 36-year-old Vittorio Arrigoni was being held and went to the location, where they found the body, the statement said. An autopsy revealed that he had been killed hours before police entered the location, it said. Medical sources said his body was taken to Shifa Hospital in Gaza. The grisly outcome came hours after a video was posted on YouTube showing a man identified by his colleagues as Arrigoni. A black blindfold covered his eyes; his right cheek appeared red as though it had been hit; his hands appeared to be bound behind his back. A hand belonging to someone outside of the view of the lens appeared to be grasping his hair on the back and pointing the captive's head toward the camera. Arabic writing scrolled over the video threatened that Arrigoni would be killed if Hesham al-Saeedni, who has been held for nearly a year by Hamas, were not released within 30 hours of 11 a.m. Thursday. Al-Saeedni is the leader of a group that may have been inspired by al Qaeda, said Alfredo Tradardi, the Italy coordinator for the International Solidarity Movement, where Arrigoni was a volunteer. The writing calls Italy an ""infidel nation whose armies are still present in Muslim lands."" Tradardi, who had initially expressed optimism that his co-worker would be released unharmed, told CNN in a telephone interview that the outcome underscores the need for progress to be made toward Middle East peace. ""Now, we have to work more deeply to try to change the foreign policy of our government, of the European government, of the United States government in order that they could press Israel to solve the problem of the Palestinians."" Arrigoni had been active in the Palestinian cause for nearly a decade, and had been allied with the International Solidarity Movement for more than two years, ""monitoring human rights violations by Israel, supporting the Palestinian popular resistance against the Israeli occupation and disseminating information about the situation in Gaza to his home country of Italy,"" the non-governmental organization said in a written statement. He was granted honorary citizenship for his work for the Palestinian people, the statement said. ""Vittorio Arrigoni is a hero of Palestine,"" said a statement released by Khalil Shaheen, head of the economics and social rights department at the Palestinian Centre for Human Rights. ""He was available everywhere to support all the poor people, the victims."" Arrigoni's colleagues last saw him about 8 p.m. Wednesday near the port in Gaza City, said Joe Catron, a member of the International Solidarity Movement. ""I think he was just the first foreigner they ran across,"" Catron said about the abductors. ""It is ironic they happened to come across someone who has dedicated a part of his life to helping Palestine."" Arrigoni, who was also working as a freelance journalist, was from the northern Italian region of Lombardy. Journalist Talal Abu-Rahmi, CNN's Yasmin Amer, Tom Watkins and Erin McLaughlin contributed to this story .","NEW: Autopsy indicates he had been dead for hours before police arrived .

"When laws went into effect in three states for same-sex couples to marry, many were quick to line up at their city halls to exchange vows.  Now they may do so in one of the nation's most prominent churches -- the Washington National Cathedral. Most Americans know the house of God, also called the Cathedral Church of St. Peter and St. Paul, as a place where sacred rites are carried out on behalf of the nation.  It has been host to the funerals of numerous presidents and of inaugural prayer services for four presidents, including Barack Obama. But it is also an active house of worship in the Episcopalian Church, said the Cathedral's dean, Gary Hall. The denomination has developed a blessing rite that mirrors current wedding ceremonies for heterosexual couples and allows each bishop to decide to allow same-sex marriages in their churches or not. Bishop Mariann Budde decided to allow the rite, since same-sex marriage is legal in the District of Columbia and now in neighboring Maryland as well, Hall said. It was Budde's decision that led Hall to create the same-sex rite. He sees it as ""another historic step toward greater equality."" The states of Washington, Maine and Maryland all legalized same-sex marriages in referendums during the 2012 general election.  It was already legal in the nation's capital. In March, the Supreme Court will hear oral arguments in two appeals cases related to same-sex marriage -- California's Proposition 8, which bans same-sex marriage and the federal Defense of Marriage Act, which denies federal benefits to same-sex couples. The American Episcopal Church is intimately connected with the Church of England, which last week approved the advancement of male priests in same-sex committed relationships to the position of bishop.  But those relationships must be celibate. City halls in Baltimore; Portland, Maine; and Seattle erupted in celebration as the first same-sex couples tied the knot in December and January. Seattle's ceremony included 133 couples, who walked outside and down rain-slickened steps afterward, where they were greeted by cheers, confetti and a brass band celebrating the first day same-sex couples could marry in Washington. To wed at the National Cathedral, one member of the couple must be baptized into the Church, and both must commit to a Christian marriage of ""lifelong faithfulness, love, forbearance and mutual comfort.""","Same-sex couples have lined up to marry in city halls .

"St. Petersburg, Russia (CNN) -- Every working night for the past 34 years, Sergey Matveev has watched from his control room as tankers, ships and barges glide across the crisp waters of St. Petersburg's River Neva. The picturesque Russian city -- built under the Tsarist reign of Peter the Great and popularly known as the ""Venice of the North"" -- is spread across a cluster of islands connected by more than 300 bridges. Some are vital traffic arteries, others are simple foot-crossings, while a special few are drawbridges that rise in the evening to let ships pass to and from the nearby Baltic Sea. As custodian of the iconic Palace Bridge, Matveev is responsible for maritime access into and out of the city's myriad canals and waterways -- but he's not alone in this endeavor. Among the others clearing the way along the river are Matveev's wife, Olga, and two sons. See also: Mammoth ships force ports to adapt . ""The Palace Bridge is under my control, the Tuchkov Bridge is under the control of my elder son and the Trinity Bridge is under the control of my younger son and wife,"" he explained. Matveev was allocated a job at the Palace Bridge in 1979 by the then Soviet authorities after graduating from high school. Two years later his wife began working at the nearby Troitsky Bridge as a mechanic. The next generation of Matveev's family were always likely to follow their parents having spent much of their youth playing in and around the drawbridges while their parents worked. ""As the children from their small age ... I would bring them, and show where I work. Later on as they finished the school, graduated from the institute they wanted themselves to start working here,"" he said. The thickly moustachioed Matveev is evidently proud of what has become his family's unusual dynasty and chuckles at the mention of locations under their ""control."" Ensuring St. Petersburg's drawbridges operate at their optimum level, however, is no easy feat. See also: What happens to goods lost at sea? Currents are often strong and some of the cargo passing ships carry can be hazardous. Any lapses of communication between bridges -- which must rise one after the other -- can mean ships stranded in dangerous waters. At the height of summer, as many as 40 commercial vessels can pass into and out of the city in a single night. According to local industry website, Port News, more than 9 million tons of freight moves along the River Neva between May and November alone (before the water freezes over during Russia's bitter winter months). Fortunately, modern technology has made things much easier for the Matveev family in this regard. The creaking old mechanical equipment of days gone by has been replaced with fully computerized systems. ""One can do it all by just touching the screen"" Matveev said. ""Earlier, most things were observed visually. Now we can see it all through the indicators,"" he added pointing to his futuristic looking work station. See also: Can gondolas cut city traffic . It's not just the technology that's changed over the years. St. Petersburg itself has morphed into a modern, cosmopolitan city. At the heart of that transformation is the city's waterfront. Today tourists flock to see the bridges, islands and sights so vividly described by giants of Russian literature like Dostoevsky. Residents meanwhile take pride in the unique architecture and historic significance of their city. ""The bridges are the symbol of St. Petersburg,"" Matveev said. ""Many people come here to observe how it takes place, this wonder of the drawing of the bridges. During the white nights there are so many people on the embankment."" ""This work is a subject of pride. Some people watch me at the TV screen (and) they say 'oh, we have seen you -- it is so great, well done.'"" It seems likely this sense of goodwill will be felt by the Matveev family for many generations to come.","Sergey Matveev has operated the Palace Bridge in St Petersburg for 34 years .

"A recall election in Colorado has shown that the national debate over guns is just as bitterly contested as ever. Two state senators who voted for stricter gun laws earlier this lost their jobs in a recall election and the outcome is reverberating through the country. State Senate President John Morse of Colorado Springs and his colleague, state Sen. Angela Giron of Pueblo, were faced with a recall after voting for Colorado's new gun law that imposed universal background checks on gun purchases and limited magazines to 15 rounds. It was the first ever recall in the state. Pro-gun control Democrats ousted in Colorado recall . The two local, off-year elections had low turnout. Only 21 percent of registered voters participated in one contest and 35 percent in the other. But the races were watched by political observers and even received a response from the head of the Democratic Party. The elections garnered national spotlight because of the topic that initiated the recall: gun control. After the mass shooting in an Aurora, Colorado, movie theater that killed 12 in July 2012 and the Newtown, Connecticut, massacre five months later that killed 26 people, mostly children, a mobilization formed to enact stricter gun laws. Colorado was the second state after New York to pass a tougher standard. Gun control advocates celebrated the steps as progress. Colorado recall a proxy in national gun control debate . ""We've seen a lot change in the last year,"" Dan Gross, president of the Brady Campaign to Stop Gun Violence, said. But gun control opponents haven't been sitting on the sidelines. They launched Colorado's first ever recall effort.  The powerful gun lobby, the National Rifle Association, told CNN that it spent between $400,000 and $500,000 to oust the Democratic lawmakers. The NRA vehemently denied that this was a national effort. ""The genesis was very much a local effort. There were voters who were not happy with the actions of the two senators and they decided to organize a recall election,"" NRA spokesperson Andrew Arulanandam said. ""What happened in Colorado was the democratic process working."" Eric Sondermann, a political analyst in Colorado, agreed. He said the recall was more about state politics than the gun vote. Elections ""yin and yang back and forth,"" he said, adding the party in power quickly becomes the party people want out of power. Regardless, the NRA and other anti-gun control groups got involved and invested heavily. Both candidates lost despite an August Pew poll that showed Colorado voters disapproved of the recall election two to one. New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who has become a major proponent of gun control, also got involved. He contributed $350,000 to keep the lawmakers in office. Missouri bill would void federal gun laws . While Gross insisted that the vote is not a referendum on gun legislation, he blamed the gun lobby. ""It's disappointing that two elected officials were undermined by the shadowy maneuvers of the corporate gun lobby and a handful of extremists,"" he said. The gun debate expands far beyond Colorado. Missouri's major gun legislation has seen both victory and defeat. The Republican-led legislature passed a bill that would outlaw the enforcement of federal gun laws, which are more stringent than state laws. The Democratic governor, however, vetoed the bill. Lawmakers might try to override the veto as early as today. Advocates on both sides of the issue said there are no other recall efforts, however. CNN contributor Paul Begala said the Colorado recall has national implications. ""If people wonder why it's so hard to persuade politicians to take tough stands, they need look no further than Colorado,"" he said. It could have national implications. After the mass shootings, President Barack Obama urged Congress to pass more stringent restrictions on gun ownership. But a massive campaign ensued and Congress was unable to pass even the most watered down measure requiring universal background checks. ""The recalls in Colorado do real damage to the cause of passing the president's gun safety proposals,"" Begala added. There are no current plans to revive the issue in Washington.","Two Colorado state senators lost jobs for a vote in favor of gun control .

"Bhavyaa Sharma feels vulnerable in the Indian capital. The 19-year-old student at a leading women's college in New Delhi fears for her safety when she leaves the campus. Sexual assaults on women in the city have horrified her and her female friends. Surviving rape: iReporters speak out . On Sunday, a 23-year-old woman was gang-raped and beaten to near death on a moving bus in New Delhi, police say. She is in intensive care at a city hospital, battling for her life. The attack sparked furious protests across India, where official data show that rape cases have jumped almost 875% over the past 40 years -- from 2,487 in 1971 to 24,206 in 2011. Read more: Can we end rape as tool of war? New Delhi alone reported 572 rapes last year and more than 600 in 2012. ""I feel vulnerable here,"" said Sharma, accompanied by her classmates. ""I am very sure about it. Delhi is not safe for women."" Opinion: Rapes show that Indian society needs a new attitude . Sharma is from Lucknow, the capital of Uttar Pradesh state. She joined Miranda House, a women's residential college in New Delhi, in 2010. She's now close to graduation. But her stay in the Indian capital hasn't been without a bitter experience. She says she was groped while commuting in a bus in this city. Read more: Indian girl seeks justice after gang rape . ""It wasn't traumatic. But I cannot forget it, either. Definitely, I cannot forget it,"" Sharma said. She called her parents back home that day, who tried to comfort her. Still, she couldn't hold back her tears. ""I cried the entire night,"" she said. Her hostel colleagues shared their own encounters with unwanted behaviors on the streets of New Delhi. In her first year of college, a group of men stalked Shweta Prakash, 20, and her friends every night they would leave their apartment for dinner. Read more: Rape is shredding Syria's social fabric . ""It actually freaks you out when people do such things to you ... eye-teasing, passing lewd comments and stalking you. They literally rape you with their eyes,"" she said. Now, she keeps pepper spray and has enrolled in self-defense taekwondo programs. Prakash and her friends hold each others' hands while walking and text license plate numbers and their location to their parents and others when they travel in a cab or a slow-moving auto-rickshaw. As young girls, elders, too, faced similar attitudes, which they say only worsened as the city and the country grew. ""I can speak about my own experience, as a student, in this city -- people are pinching you, touching you, someone is coming close to you. This is absolutely the mentality where you look at a woman as an object of sex and (which) you use and abuse,"" rights activist Ranjana Kumari said. Read more: Rights group: Police rape woman in Tunisia, then charge her with indecency . As furor about Sunday's assault rose, some Indian lawmakers even called for treating rape as a capital crime. The country's human rights body shot off notices to city police and federal authorities, demanding an explanation of the latest sexual assault. ""The incident has raised the issue of declining public confidence in the law and order machinery in the city, especially in its capacity to ensure safety of women, as a number of such incidents have been reported in the national capital in the recent past,"" the National Human Rights Commission said in a statement Tuesday. Five people, including the bus driver and a minor, have been arrested in connection with Sunday's rape, New Delhi police spokesman Rajan Bhagat said. Read more: Rape in wartime: Listening to the victims . Meantime, some observers say anti-women acts in India stem from the country's largely patriarchal social setup. Indians' preference for sons over daughters, for example, has manifested itself in a worrisome population imbalance. The 2011 census of the world's second-most populous nation recorded an alarming drop in the percentage of girls among country's preschoolers. For every 1,000 boys up to 6 years old, the census counted 914 girls, a drop from 927 a decade ago. It's illegal in India to abort a child because of its sex, but such abortions happen, often aided by illegal clinics. ""The reasons for the high number of female feticide in India include a deep-rooted traditional son preference, continued practice of dowry and concern for safety of the girl child and exploitation and abuse of women and girl children,"" Krishna Tirath, India's women and child development minister, acknowledged in parliament in March 2011. A senior legal expert says legislation alone cannot resolve anti-women biases. ""More law will only serve to give a sense of something being done, when in fact very little is being done. To confront the hatred that is now manifesting itself in the most egregious ways is to move forward as a society,"" Ratna Kapur, a professor at Jindal Global Law School, wrote in The Hindu newspaper Wednesday. ""We need to think about how we can handle women's equality in ways that are not perceived as threatening. That demands greater responsibility on the part of parents as well as society not to raise sons in a way in which they are indoctrinated with a sense of superiority and privilege. There is also a need on the part of young men to be actively involved in their schools and communities in advocating women's equality rights,"" she added in her opinion column, headlined ""Rape and the crisis of Indian masculinity.""","Police say a 23-year-old woman was gang-raped, beaten to near death on a bus in New Delhi .

"If you and your significant other share political views, it could be because you like each other's smell. Results from a new study released Monday by the American Journal of Political Science show that body odor may play an initial role in the matching of individuals with similar attitudes on political ideology. In the study, 125 participants rated the attractiveness of smells from strong liberals and strong conservatives, but the participants couldn't see the individuals and didn't know anything about their political views. ""People could not predict the political ideology of others by smell if you asked them, but they differentially found the smell of those who aligned with them more attractive,"" said Dr. Rose McDermott, lead author of the study. ""So I believe smell conveys important information about long-term affinity in political ideology that becomes incorporated into a key component of subconscious attraction."" What does smell have to do with politics? According to the study, smell helps individuals choose mates because the sense can signal possible social and biological behaviors, such as disease avoidance, disgust sensitivity, cheater detection and social cohesion. ""For example, greater disgust sensitivity, which is intimately interconnected with the neural substrates of smell, predicts more conservative positions, particularly around issues involving morality and sexual reproduction,"" the article notes. Those who were doing the smelling took whiffs of small gauze pads that had been worn under the arms of 21 individuals for 24 hours.","A new study shows that body odor could play a role in matching political ideologies .

"A dusty, well-worn navy van pulls into the driveway of a grey, discrete home on a residential street. A woman opens the metal doors of the garage, but the van does not pull in. Instead, a boy about 12 years old gets out and begins to unload plastic buckets, duffel bags, sacks of potatoes, foam mattresses, blankets and other household items, piling them up neatly in the corner. ""We arrived in Lebanon less than a week ago,"" Adla, 35, says. She pulls out a crisp piece of white paper with her name and details scribbled in Arabic and a red-ink stamp of the Lebanese cedar: a national symbol of strength, resilience and permanence. Her hazel eyes swell with tears. ""In Syria, we used to have a big house—three bedrooms,"" Adla says. ""We had land and I used to plant olive trees. Now, this (garage) is our home."" She left Syria with her husband, 46, and her children, ages 12, 11, 9, 3 and 1. Their home destroyed and her husband without work, they borrowed what money they could from friends and family and headed for Lebanon. As the war around them intensified, they fled feeling as if they had no other option; it was a matter of survival. ""We left our village with the clothes on our back at 4 a.m. in the rain,"" Adla says. Adla and her family are among the thousands of Syrians who arrive in Lebanon each day, their lives torn apart by war and with few resources to start anew in Lebanon. They arrive with what they could carry and with little, if any, financial cushion to support themselves as they try to create some semblance of normalcy in Lebanon. The refugee crisis in Syria may not be as overt as other emergencies like the Haiti earthquake, where the displaced clustered together by the tens of thousands in what were called ""tent cities,"" but the fact is more than 1 million Syrian refugees are living in Lebanon and make up nearly 30% of its population. To put this into context, it would be as if the United States' population grew by 100 million in the course of just 2½ years, with more than 50% of them arriving in 2013. In the absence of large, formal tented settlements, which are prohibited by the Lebanese government, the vast majority of Syrian refugees are forced to settle wherever they can find shelter. According to UNHCR, only 1% of Syrian refugees are living in rent-free unused buildings like schools, known as collective shelters. That means the remaining hundreds of thousands of Syrian refugees in Lebanon are forced to rent what land or shelter they can find. Some rent open patches of land to build small shelters that are a patchwork of scraps of plastic, cardboard, canvas and wood. Others find shelter in unused buildings such as schools and mosques, which they often share with other refugee families. However, many, like Adla and her family, opt to rent the cheapest accommodation they can find: a garage. Drive through any street in Akkar, the poorest and northernmost district of Lebanon, and you will see clusters of people outside what used to be garages. Because they were built to house cars, not people, they often do not have plumbing, running water or electricity. However, with more than 1 million Syrian refugees living in Lebanon, the demand for shelter sent rental prices for garages soaring, often to around $200 a month. With few jobs available and what savings they had quickly evaporating, many Syrian refugees find it extremely difficult to make their monthly rent payments. Ahmad, 43, a father of three, who lives in an informal tented settlement with 14 other families beside a concrete factory just south of Halba, the capital of Akkar district, says that he and his family are constantly making sacrifices to make ends meet. ""We haven't had meat or chicken in five months,"" Ahmad says, standing in front of his one-room, wood-frame shelter perched on a piece of concrete. The few square meters of land cost Ahmad and his family 50,000 Lebanese lire, about $30, a month. While Syrian refugees like Ahmad were able to escape to Lebanon with tens or hundreds of dollars in savings, the money will be gone soon and they will almost certainly be pushed over the edge into poverty, with few remaining assets, and no prospects for income.  Ahmad's family and hundreds of thousands of others like them, once solidly in the middle third of the UN Human Development Index, could easily tumble into the bottom third.  The future of Syria's next generation hangs in the balance. Impact Your World: How to help Syrian refugees . With the war showing no sign of abating and one-third of Syria's housing destroyed, there is little hope that Samar, Adla, Ahmad and the hundreds of thousands of refugees like them in Lebanon will be able to return home any time soon. That leaves them with no other choice but to find a way to survive as refugees in Lebanon. Rather than planning for the future, refugee families like Adla's have to figure out how to put food on the table, stay warm during the winter, get their children into school—all while what lives they built, what homes they owned, what money they saved were obliterated in the war. With thousands more Syrians arriving every day, more rent-free shelter options have to be created—and quickly. Concern Worldwide, with support from UNCHR, is focusing on getting what unused buildings they can find into habitable condition so that more refugees can live in safe, rent-free accommodations with safe drinking water, electricity and plumbing. Concern Worldwide is converting five former farm buildings into multifamily buildings complete with latrines, shared cooking areas and utilities. Once complete, they will house some 805 Syrian refugees. While the new collective centers will open up a new shelter option for hundreds of Syrian families in Akkar district, they just scratch the surface of the wider need. Without more shelter options, hundreds of thousands of Syrian refugees will fall through the cracks the moment they arrive, slipping into obscurity behind metal garage doors.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Former South African President Nelson Mandela is to be removed from a U.S. terrorism watch list under a bill President Bush signed Tuesday. Mandela and other members of the African National Congress have been on the list because of their fight against South Africa's apartheid regime, which gave way to majority rule in 1994. Apartheid was the nation's system of legalized racial segregation that was enforced by the National Party government between 1948 and 1994. The bill gives the State Department and the Homeland Security Department the authority to waive restrictions against ANC members. ""He had no place on our government's terror watch list, and I'm pleased to see this bill finally become law,"" said Sen. John Kerry of Massachusetts. South Africa's apartheid government had designated the ANC a terrorist organization during the group's decades-long struggle against whites-only rule. Its members have been barred from receiving U.S. visas without special permission, and the bill Bush signed will lift that requirement, State Department spokesman Tom Casey said. ""What it will do is make sure that there aren't any extra hoops for either a distinguished individual, like former President Mandela, or other members of the African National Congress to get a U.S. visa,"" Casey said. Mandela shared the Nobel Peace Prize in 1993 with F. W. de Klerk, the South African president and National Party leader who worked with Mandela to end apartheid. Mandela replaced him as president in 1994 and served until 1999. Recognized as a symbol of freedom and equality, Mandela will turn 90 on July 18. iReport.com: Have you ever met Mandela? He spent 27 years in prison on charges that included sabotage committed while he spearheaded the struggle against apartheid. He was released in 1990.

"(CNN) -- Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan, a Christian from the south, was sworn-in on Sunday as his country tries to bounce back from violence unleashed last month by an Islamist sect. Boko Haram, an Islamic group that has challenged Nigerian government, is believed to be behind a series of bombings in the wake of Jonathan's re-election. This will be Jonathan's first full term; as vice president, he took over the presidency in May 2010 upon the death of then-President Umaru Yar'Adua, who had suffered from a heart condition. In keeping with his name, he is regarded as one of the luckiest men in Nigerian politics. Jonathan, 53, with a degree in zoology, worked as an environmental officer until he entered politics. He ran as deputy governor for Bayelsa state in 2001-- one of Nigeria's main oil-producing states in the oil-rich Niger Delta region. After the state governor -- Diepreye Alamieyeseigha -- was indicted by Nigeria's Economic and Financial Crimes Commission on corruption charges in 2006, Jonathan was promoted to governor of one of the richest regions in Africa. He is widely regarded as having been hand-picked by then-President Olusegun Obasanjo to run as vice-president with Yar'Adua in the 2007 national elections. They won what was considered perhaps the most flawed election in Nigerian history. This year's win by Jonathan, who is from the majority-Christian southern part of the country, sparked violence in the Muslim-dominated north. Explosions in Nigeria's northeastern state of Borno killed a few and wounded dozens in late April in the days leading up to national governorship elections in attacks that police described as attempts to intimidate voters who had picked Jonathan. Northern Muslims in some areas charged that the presidential election was rigged. Armed protesters in the region took to the streets chanting the name of former military ruler Muhammadu Buhari, the main opposition front-runner. The last election, four years ago, was widely condemned for rampant vote rigging, violence, theft of ballot boxes and intimidation. While this year's presidential election was marred by violence, reports of underage voting and logistical problems, observers said they considered it an improvement. After he was declared the victor, Jonathan warned that persistent post-election violence could threaten the stability of the country. ""These acts of mayhem are sad reminders of the events which plunged our country into 30 months of an unfortunate civil war,"" Jonathan said last week. Jonathan was referring to a period of unrest in the 1960s that spawned a civil war in Nigeria. Nigeria is Africa's largest oil producer and its most populous nation, with 150 million people. CNN's Christian Purefoy contributed to this report.","Jonathan was re-elected in April to his first full term .

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- Federal biologists said Friday they had signed off on a plan aimed at providing relief to the drought-parched Southeast, under which more water will be retained in Georgia instead of being released into Florida. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service expedited its study of an interim drought plan submitted two weeks ago by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and concluded that freshwater mussels and sturgeon -- kept alive by water from Georgia's Chattahoochee watershed under federal law -- will not be placed in jeopardy under the plan. However, there will be some effects, and some members of the species probably will die, Sam Hamilton, Southeast regional director for the Fish and Wildlife Service, told reporters. Under the plan, the amount of water released from the Jim Woodruff Dam in Chattahoochee, Florida, will be gradually decreased. That process had already begun Friday, said Brig. Gen. Joseph Schroedel, South Atlantic Division commander for the Corps of Engineers. A similar plan will be put into effect on the Alabama River, at a point south of Montgomery, Alabama, officials said. Last month, Georgia Gov. Sonny Perdue declared a water supply emergency in north Georgia, and asked a court to require the Corps of Engineers to restrict water flows from Lake Lanier -- the main source of Atlanta's water -- and other reservoirs. He blasted what he said were ""silly rules,"" noting that even if Georgia gets rain, it cannot conserve water because it must release 3.2 billion gallons a day downstream. Alabama, Georgia and Florida have been wrangling over water usage from two river basins -- the Alabama-Coosa-Tallapoosa (ACT) and the Apalachicola-Chattahoochee-Flint (ACF) -- for years. Meanwhile, the population of metropolitan Atlanta has doubled to more than 5 million since 1980. Lake Lanier is at the headwaters of the ACF system, so cutting the flow of water from the Woodruff Dam will mean less water will need to be released from Lake Lanier.  See why the three states are struggling over the water » . Rainfall in north Georgia, including the Atlanta metropolitan area, is more than a foot below normal levels for this time of year, following a series of drier-than-normal years. Georgia has imposed a mandatory ban on outdoor water use by homeowners in the region. Two weeks ago, Perdue met with federal officials, Alabama Gov. Bob Riley and Florida Gov. Charlie Crist to discuss a drought plan, and the plan approved Friday by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service was announced. In light of the negotiations, Perdue has dropped his lawsuit against the corps. Florida's governor has voiced some concerns about the recommendations from the November 1 meeting. Jim Connaughton, chairman of the U.S. Council on Environmental Quality, told reporters Friday that negotiations continue to work through some of the issues facing Florida, but some concerns, ""at least with respect to the near term,"" have been addressed. Asked whether he thinks Crist would sue over the matter, Connaughton said governors of the three states have committed to finding a solution for future years if the drought persists. The governors will meet December 11 and 12 in Tallahassee, Florida, to continue negotiations, U.S. Interior Secretary Dirk Kempthorne said Friday. ""We're in an extreme situation ... but you see, at this point, some two weeks after sitting down and going through a number of these things, some real progress has been made."" The plan also provides for increasing water storage, officials said. ""If the corps does not hold back some water now, and if extreme drought conditions continue, it is possible there may not be enough water in storage next summer to meet the needs of users,"" the corps said in a statement. In signing off on the drought plan, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service only examined possible effects on species listed on the federal endangered list, Hamilton said, so the revised plan's effect on oysters, shrimp and other species in Florida's Apalachicola Bay is unknown, although it will be studied. Connaughton, however, noted that the plan is only temporary, until the Southeast receives some much-needed rain.  See which parts of U.S. face worst drought » . Crist, for his part, said in a written statement Friday that the state ""will continue to focus on the needs of the people who depend on a healthy Apalachicola Bay."" He said that while he is ""disappointed"" that Georgia's initial request to reduce releases from Woodruff Dam was extended, the corps has promised Florida it will regularly evaluate the environmental effects on the bay. Schroedel disputed reports that have said Lake Lanier only has a finite number of days left for Atlanta's water supply, saying the lake has not reached its record low. ""It doesn't look that pretty, but there's still a lot of water there,"" he said. E-mail to a friend .","Fish and Wildlife Service: Plan has limited effect on mussels, sturgeon downstream .

"The rise in antibiotic-resistant bacteria could lead to a future full of untreatable infections, experts have warned us for years. Now the Obama administration is stepping up its efforts to combat the rising problem of antibiotic resistance. The President signed an executive order Thursday establishing a new inter-agency task force charged with developing a national strategy to combat antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Dr. John Holdren, director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy and assistant to the President, said the problem is a serious challenge to public health and national security. ""We are clearly in a fight against ... bacteria where no permanent treatment is possible."" When you need antibiotics -- and when you don't . The task force will be co-chaired by the secretaries of Health & Human Services, the Department of Defense and the Department of Agriculture. The task force must submit its national action plan to the President by February 15, 2015. The order also established a Presidential Advisory Council made up of nongovernmental experts who will provide advice and recommendations to strengthen surveillance of infections, research new treatments and develop alternatives to antibiotics for use in agriculture. On Thursday, the administration released ""National Strategy on Combating Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria,"" a five-year plan to prevent and contain outbreaks and develop the next generation of tests, antibiotics and vaccines. The President's Council of Advisers on Science and Technology -- known as PCAST -- also released a report on combating antibiotic resistance. There are three main components to the report: improve surveillance of antibiotic-resistant bacteria and stop outbreaks; increase the life of current antibiotics and develop new ones, as well as promote research accelerating clinical trials; and increase economic incentives to develop new antibiotics. In fact, a $20 million prize will be given to spur development of tests health care professionals can use to identify highly resistant bacterial infections. ""What's new here is there is a highly federal focus that's highly coordinated,"" said Dr. Eric Lander, co-chair of PCAST. ""We are endorsing a variety of specific goals in order to get our arms around this problem. If we're producing antibiotics at a greater rate than we're losing them, then we win in the long run."" Each year 23,000 deaths and 2 million illnesses are linked to antibiotic-resistant infections, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The agency estimates the impact to the economy is as high as $20 billion in direct health care costs. Last year, for the first time, the CDC classified drug-resistant superbugs by how dangerous they were. They were ranked ""urgent,"" ""serious"" and ""concerning"" based on how many people get sick, the number of hospitalizations and how many deaths were attributed to them. ""If we can target our efforts more effectively,"" CDC Director Dr. Tom Frieden said, ""we can help doctors use antibiotics more wisely."" Dr. Jesse Goodman, director of the Center on Medical Product Access, Safety and Stewardship at Georgetown University Medical Center, says antibiotic resistance is one of the most pressing global public health threats. Until earlier this year, Goodman was the Food and Drug Administration's Chief Scientist. He co-chaired the first U.S. Task Force to Combat Antimicrobial Resistance, which released the first action plan in 2000. He  says investment in new treatments must be paired with the sensible use of new and existing antibiotics. ""Success will require a sea change. Doctors, farmers and agribusiness, health systems and the public all need to think totally differently about antibiotics,"" Goodman said. ""They are precious resources and we must reduce their inappropriate use. Better diagnosis and stronger infection control practices can make a big difference right now.""","Obama administration steps up efforts to combat problem of antibiotic resistance .

"(WIRED)  -- When you're shopping for an iPad 2, you have a dozen configurations to choose from, and some recent discoveries will make this decision much easier for you. To configure your iPad 2, you have 12 options as you decide on color, storage and, most importantly, data connection -- 3G + Wi-Fi, or Wi-Fi-only. It turns out that if you're one of the millions of people who own an Android phone or an iPhone, you don't need a 3G model, which will save you a big chunk of cash. Here's why. Smartphone hotspots . The most recent U.S. iPhones (the 3GS and the iPhone 4, when upgraded to the latest version of iOS) and the vast majority of Android smartphones now officially support wireless-hotspot capability, which turns the handset into a Wi-Fi connection that can be shared with multiple devices, including the iPad 2. More on tablets and e-readers from WIRED . So if you go with a Wi-Fi-only model and you want to hop on a cellular connection, you can activate the hotspot option on your smartphone through your carrier, pay $20 per month and connect the iPad to that. That's not as seamless as having 3G built into the iPad, but it will save you the extra $130 you'd plunk down on a 3G model. Plus, you'd have to pay at least $15 a month just to use an iPad's 3G connection anyway. Jailbreaking for free hotspots . If you're down with getting a little dirty, you can use your Android phone or iPhone as a hotspot without paying monthly fees by hacking your device. For Android phones, you just have to root (aka jailbreak) the device with a tool called Unrevoked. For rooted Android phones, there are unauthorized apps called Wireless Tether and Barnacle, which offer free hotspot utilities. You can also flash your device and install CyanogenMod, a different Android skin that includes a built-in hotspot feature. Presto. For the iPhone, all you have to do is jailbreak with any of the tools out there. (Do note that if you do update to the latest version of iOS, you can't jailbreak yet.) Jailbreaking will install the Cydia app, which gives you access to the underground Cydia app store. There, you can download the unauthorized app MyWi, which costs a one-time fee of $20, and doesn't charge you monthly. GPS transplant . The Wi-Fi iPad doesn't have built-in GPS, but if you want to use that beautiful Maps app for navigation, you still don't need a 3G iPad, so long as you have an iPhone. It turns out that if you hotspot with an iPhone, the connection transfers the GPS to the iPad. Just connect the iPad to the iPhone's hotspot, then launch the Maps app, and you'll see the blue dot tracking your location. (We're not sure if this works when hotspotting with an Android phone -- if you can confirm, let us know in the comments.) 3G FaceTime . Another surprise is that if you turn your smartphone into a wireless hotspot, you can connect to it with your iPad 2 and use FaceTime videoconferencing. That's interesting because typically you can't use FaceTime over a 3G connection; it's supposed to only work on a Wi-Fi connection. Because a hotspot shows up as a Wi-Fi connection, you're basically tricking the iPad 2 into using a 3G connection for FaceTime.

"Lagos, Nigeria (CNN) -- Roughly 17,000 people fled their homes in eight northern Nigerian states as violence erupted after presidential elections in Africa's most populous nation, the Nigerian Red Cross said Tuesday. The agency reported deaths but could not give an exact number. It was treating 360 people who suffered injuries, said spokesman Andronicus Adeyemo. Incumbent President Goodluck Jonathan, who was declared the winner Monday, appealed for unity as the breadth of the unrest sounded alarms for the government. ""My brothers and sisters, we are all winners,"" Jonathan said in a televised address. ""In this context there is no victor and no vanquished. We have demonstrated, even in our diversity, the progress of Nigeria remains paramount for all."" Jonathan suspended Interior Minister Capt. Emmenuel Iheanacho on Tuesday, handing the portfolio to his labor minister. ""For now, his continued manning of the ministry is not in the interest of the nation,"" Jonathan said in a statement. Nigerians in the northern states rioted after it became apparent that Jonathan had won, charging that the elections had been rigged. Tuesday, the government deployed the military to restive areas as strict curfews helped maintain calm. But peace was tenuous, and another round of voting is coming up in a week. Nigeria's elections, staggered over three weeks, conclude with the vote for governors April 26. Jonathan hails from a Christian and animist south that is rich with oil. On the streets of the northern, mainly Muslim cities, rioters shouted the name of former military ruler Gen. Muhammadu Buhari, the main opposition candidate. The results highlighted modern Nigeria's deep divide. Buhari's office issued a statement Tuesday calling reports of burning of worship places a ""sad, unfortunate and totally unwarranted development."" ""I must say that this is a dastardly act (that) is not initiated by any of our supporters and therefore cannot be supported by our party,"" said Buhari's spokesman Yinka Odumakin. ""I must emphasize that this is purely a political matter, and it should not in any way be turned into an ethnic, religious or regional one."" Nigeria's credibility was riding on the elections after a 2007 vote that was condemned for rampant vote rigging, violence, theft of ballot boxes and intimidation. The election this year, though marred by violence and delays because of organizational failures, was considered an improvement. British Foreign Secretary William Hague hailed the vote as a ""significant step forward"" for Nigeria. However, only the ruling People's Democratic Party has signed the results; representatives of the other parties refused to do so. The Civil Society Election Situation Room observers noted a number of irregularities, including underage voting in several states, intimidation and cases of thumbprints placed on ballots. The observers lashed out at the Independent Nigerian Election Council's management of the election and said it had been ""ineffective"" in its oversight function. ""The collation process seems to have been the weakest link in the election management process,"" the Civil Society report said. ""This state of affairs raised doubts about the authenticity of some of the figures arising from this process. Further, there were allegations that, in some cases, figures may have been doctored.""

"(CNN) -- The Anchorage, Alaska, airport reopened Sunday afternoon after being closed after an eruption of a nearby volcano on Saturday. Ash from Alaska's Mount Redoubt volcano has been falling, causing flight cancelations. Ash from Mount Redoubt fell around the city, Alaska's largest, resulting in the closure of Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport, the Federal Aviation Administration said. Only a trace amount of the ash reached the airport grounds, airport spokesman Jeremy Lindseth said, but it was enough to affect operations. The airport reopened at about 2 p.m. ( 6 p.m. ET) Sunday, according to the airport's operations office. The eruption occurred at about 1:30 p.m. (5:30 p.m. ET) Saturday, the U.S. Geological Survey told CNN. The eruption shot ash about 45,000 feet in the air, officials said. The volcano erupted four times on Friday, at times shooting ash 51,000 feet into the air. The eruptions are the latest in a series that began March 22. The Alaska Volcano Observatory has set the alert level at red, its highest possible designation. That indicates an eruption is under way or imminent and the eruption will produce a ""significant emission of volcanic ash into the atmosphere."" iReport.com: Send photos, videos of the volcanic ash . Friday's volcano activity prompted Alaska Airlines to limit flights to and from Anchorage, according to the airline's Web site. The airline canceled all its Thursday flights to and from Anchorage after an eruption earlier in the day sent an ash cloud 65,000 feet high.

"(CNN)  -- Rain-swollen rivers have inundated highways and farms, towns and parks in western Washington, shutting down traffic on a 20-mile stretch of heavily traveled Interstate 5 between Seattle and Oregon and threatening the federal roadway north of Seattle. Flooding forces officials to close a road in Arlington, Washington, north of Seattle. ""If you're trying to do commerce between Portland [Oregon] and Seattle, there is no way right now,"" said Bob Calkins, a spokesman for the Washington State Emergency Operations Center in Camp Murray near Tacoma. ""That's the major way into Washington state from Oregon."" Flooding south of Seattle near Chehalis covered parts of I-5 with 30 inches of water, prompting its closure until at least Monday, state transportation officials said. And state and local roads also were victims of the water. ""The problem is the one real good detour is just as flooded,"" Calkins said. North of Seattle, a levee failure in Arlington brought the Stillaguamish River up to the edges of I-5, which remained open although some access ramps were closed, transportation officials said. The rain also caused Amtrak to suspend service between Seattle and Portland until Saturday, ""with no alternative transportation,"" the rail line said on its Web site. iReport.com: Are you there? Share pics, video . On Friday morning, the National Weather Service extended flood warnings for parts of six rivers that flow through five counties in western Washington near Seattle and Tacoma. Those affected included Puyallup River near Orting, Newaukum River near Chehalis, White River near Buckley, Cowlitz River at Randle, Skookumchuck River near Bucoda and Centralia, and the Chehalis River at Centralia and Porter and near Grand Mound. The weather service canceled flood warnings for two rivers -- the Nisqually near National and the Deschutes near Rainier. This week's flooding has caused hundreds of families to evacuate, according to the Washington Emergency Management Division. It prompted 18 counties and 13 cities to declare emergencies, the division said. Across the state, a number of rivers had crested, but flooded roads remained hazardous. The risk of landslides was high, leading to the closure of all passes across the Cascades, officials said.  Watch a report from CNN affiliate KIRO about landslide risks » . A meteorologist for the National Weather Service in Seattle said 15 inches of rain that began Monday had ended. The rainfall swept across virtually all of the state, but its biggest effects occurred along the western half of Puget Sound, Calkins said. The swollen Puyallup River threatened the town by the same name, but Loretta Cutter sprang into action. The administrator of a group home and a longtime resident there helped evacuate 47 residents from the Valley Community Inn, a home for the mentally challenged and developmentally disabled, to a shelter at a nearby church. And she made sure her husband and a grandson left their one-story rambler house and got safely situated. ""It's a situation you don't realize you are going to be in; it's always someone else,"" Cutter said from the shelter at the Sunrise Baptist Church in Puyallup, east of Tacoma. ""It was pretty traumatizing to all of us."" Cutter is one of 40,000 residents in at least 19 communities whom authorities asked to leave their homes Thursday amid heavy flooding along rivers and streams in western Washington. Some 260 of them sought shelter Wednesday night at the 39 shelters for people, Calkins said. In addition, seven livestock and two pet shelters were set up, he said. Meanwhile, the torrential downpours of the past few days transformed Thursday into drizzle, common in western Washington, which typically gets less rainfall in any given year than does Miami, Florida. ""It just drizzles every day, or so it seems, whereas in Miami, when it rains, it's a belly washer,"" Calkins said. This week's flooding was worsened by a warm spell that melted up to 7 feet of snow that had fallen around Puget Sound, he said. Health authorities have issued occasional boil-water orders, but Calkins said he had other concerns. ""The larger issue is, as people go to their homes, they may be walking through floodwater that is contaminated by sewage,"" he said.","NEW: Flood warnings extended for parts of six rivers in western Washington .

He's also smooth at grinding the rail and can do a perfect a mini-ramp jump -- a leap off an incline that gets you and your wheels airborne. M.J. Rahimi has mastered some of the world's most popular skateboarding tricks. But the one skill that's fast making Rahimi a recognized name is crafting skateboards inside his basement in the Iranian capital of Tehran. The country has been quietly but steadily putting itself on the map in the world of action skateboarding. ""I'm very happy I'm making skateboards,"" Rahimi said. ""My biggest dream is to make a skateboard and have a professional skate on it."" Rahimi says his first homemade board shattered into pieces but he kept at it when the sport started picking up popularity several years ago. Demand for affordable equipment picked up too. He starts by gluing together thin layers of maple wood, then presses them into sloped boards, and carves and sands them into shape. ""When I first started, my dad said it will never work, but now he supports me,"" he says. Rahimi reveals his plan is to create an affordable brand. He hopes to sell his boards at the growing number of skate shops in the Islamic Republic where trendy teenagers shop for the latest gear. According to skate store owner Ali Reza Ansari, business is brisk. ""We are doing our best to improve skateboarding here,"" Ansari said. ""We have really good skaters here (in Tehran)."" Ever since the 1979 Islamic Revolution, the leadership here in Iran has been wary of the spread and influence of western culture. Rock and roll music, for example, is banned. So is dancing in public. But when it comes to skateboarding not only does the government seem OK with it, in many ways they're actually supporting it. The government has authorized six skate parks in the capital Tehran alone as well as others in Ahvaz, Isfahan, Shiraz, Tabriz and even the holy city of Qom. Perfect arenas for Iran's growing skateboard community to gather and show off their gnarly kick-flips and 360 spins.

"(CNN) -- For three decades, Mike and Sue Sibson expected the normal ups and downs that come with working a South Dakota farm and raising two kids. But when circumstances forced the Sibsons to let an oil pipeline bisect their property in 2009, it darkened their view of the American dream. ""I don't feel as free as I used to be,"" says Mike Sibson. ""I don't trust anybody anymore."" In 2006, oil pipeline operators knocked on the Sibsons' door and began talks aimed at burying a 1.25-mile long, 30-inch wide steel pipeline four feet under the middle of their Miner County farm. The Sibsons said they didn't want it, but the pipeline operator, TransCanada, claimed eminent domain. That left the Sibsons and many of the neighbors with little choice but to allow construction. Although TransCanada paid the Sibsons an undisclosed sum in a sealed settlement to use the land, ""It's really not about the money,"" said Mike Sibson. ""It's actually about how they can come in and take your land and do whatever the heck they want with it."" Ever since, the Sibsons say they've worried about leaks from the underground river of crude flowing about a quarter mile from their farmhouse. The pipeline, say company officials, is outfitted with a constantly monitored safety system featuring state-of-the-art technology and an emergency response plan. ""We raise cattle on grass,"" said Sue Sibson. ""Our livelihood is that grass out there, and if that gets ruined, we're out of business."" Some experts fear two issues that were blamed for the Gulf tragedy -- spotty government oversight and emergency response -- could result in a disastrous spill somewhere along America's  approximately 170,000 miles of oil pipelines. In May and then again in June, TransCanada reported small oil leaks at two pumping stations near the Sibson farm -- one less than two miles up the pipeline. Mike Sibson complains that TransCanada should have alerted his family about the incidents. ""I might be the first one to spot a leak because I can't depend on them to get the job done."" ""No sense in alarming them,"" said TransCanada Vice President Robert Jones. ""There was no concern with regard to the environment or public safety with these very, very small, isolated incidents."" Significant hazardous oil pipeline spills spiked during the past 20 years at 176 in 1994 and dipped to their lowest level -- 99 -- last year, according to federal statistics. The Gulf disaster and then Michigan's 800,000-gallon pipeline oil spill in July has put the pipeline industry under a microscope and placed more pressure on TransCanada during a critical time. The Calgary-based company is seeking U.S. permission to build a new oil pipeline stretching from Alberta, Canada, to refineries on the Texas Gulf Coast more than 1,600 miles to the south. The project is billed as an ""energy security"" project aimed at reducing U.S. dependence on Mideast crude. Environmental groups have mounted a campaign against the project, which TransCanada has named Keystone XL. Oil pumped through Keystone XL would come from Canada's fuel-rich sand, which produces what the Natural Resources Defense Council calls ""some of the dirtiest, most destructive oil on the face of the Earth."" They say processing the fuel involves strip mining valuable forests and burning it yields more pollution than other kinds of oil.  The Environmental Protection Agency is recommending that the State Department, which will ultimately approve or deny the project, assess the implications of committing to a ""relatively high carbon source of oil."" Also, the NRDC warns that the pipeline would threaten one of America's largest underground sources of fresh water, the 175,000-square-mile High Plains Aquifer. It provides water to 1.9 million people and irrigation for thousands of square miles of farmland throughout eight states.  ""If there was to be a spill that would contaminate that aquifer, we would be looking at a disaster in terms of livelihoods and ecosystems of the magnitude of the Gulf oil spill,"" said the NRDC's Susan Casey-Lefkowitz. The aquifer runs under portions of Nebraska's geologically unique grassy dunes known as Sand Hills, where many bird species rest during migration. ""I would worry about an oil spill in the Sand Hills more than any other area I can think of,"" said John Gates, an Oxford-trained professor of hydrology at the University of Nebraska. ""The ground is sandy and steep. In a worst-case scenario, oil could easily move from the surface through the sand to the aquifer."" TransCanada is very confident, said Jones, that its safety systems will protect the region's natural resources from the flow of oil. ""We have measures in both design and operations to ensure protection of the aquifer,"" he said. Much of the technology protecting the pipeline would be centered at TransCanada's Calgary communications hub, using satellites and land-based backup communication lines to remotely monitor pipeline valves and pumping stations for possible spills, said Jones. Every five seconds, remote sensors along the pipeline will transmit data via the satellite and land lines measuring conditions inside the pipe, including pressure, temperature and oil-flow speed. Computers are programmed to automatically shut down the pipeline when the data indicates trouble. The system is manned 24/7/365 by operators who can view the entire pipeline network or a single valve or pipe, Jones said. ""The time in which we can isolate those valves from this control center takes about three minutes,"" Jones said. ""Then immediately the operation control center dispatches emergency response personnel to the scene."" Typically a first responder would confirm the spill and assesses whether local emergency officials should secure the scene for public safety, said Jones. The oil is then isolated, cleaned up and any affected soil is remediated. Officials also notify regulators, per federal safety mandates. But problems with newer pipelines might not pose the largest concern among industry leaders. A bigger threat may be aging pipelines. Leading industry analyst Richard Kuprewicz of Accufacts Inc. urged Congress in July to strengthen laws regarding pipeline repairs. He specifically cited  corrosion of the pipe material, ""because corrosion right now is the leading cause of failure for liquid pipelines in the U.S.,"" Kuprewicz told CNN. Nationwide, some pipeline operators are ""disregarding some of the more practical things they need to be doing ... like corrosion monitoring."" Kuprewicz wants the law to require operators to disclose more details about their pipeline repairs, answering questions that would help regulators track and predict pipe failures. Was the pipe repair related to corrosion? Was it related to third-party damage? Was it related to the material of the pipe? This information, if reported by operators, might help the entire industry sidestep disaster, suggested Kuprewicz. How worried should Americans be about these aging pipelines -- some of them hidden right under our feet? ""I wouldn't say we're in a total state of chaos,"" he said. ""But we are getting concerned."" None of the assurances from TransCanada or the prospect of improved safety rules changes Mike Sibson's view on the pipeline that cuts through the heart of his farm. It likely will remain buried there for generations. ""We've done good through the years and we're quite successful -- but here's one thing that could take me out,"" he said. ""And there's not a thing I can do about it.""","Family fears oil pipeline on their farm will leak and ruin their livelihood .

"Regardless of how the Supreme Court rules on health care reform, the justices have one thing in common, and one thing in common with a growing cohort of Americans: They are aging. America faces an unprecedented wave of aging as members of the iconic baby boomer generation turn 65. This year alone, 4 million Americans will join the growing ranks of senior citizens. The Affordable Care Act strengthened the Medicare system that this growing senior population relies on. Health care reform reduces the cost of prescription drugs, brings down costs for patients using private Medicare supplements and increases access to free preventative services. The Affordable Care Act makes health care more affordable for senior citizens and ensures that doctors are compensated fairly for their services. While Medicare certainly needs adjusting, if the law is overturned, the challenges of Medicare financing will only get worse. For the millions of senior citizens and about-to-be seniors in America the improvements brought by  health care reform are just an important first step. We must protect the progress made by the Affordable Care Act, but much more is needed to support our rapidly growing older adult population to help them live independently, at home and in our communities with dignity. A vital home care work force has developed to meet these needs, and its interests are inextricably bound to the future of health care. The average hourly wage of a home care worker in the United States is less than $10 per hour. Poverty wages and a lack of benefits, training and career pathways mean turnover is constant. The work force can barely meet the current need for care, supports and services, let alone what's to come. More families are turning to immigrant women of color to provide care for their loved ones. These women work tirelessly to feed and bathe our nation's senior citizens, serve as a go-between with family and doctors, count medication, even take care of pets, and yet they are denied basic wages, let alone benefits, worker protections and pathways to citizenship. In fact, one out of two direct care workers supplements his or her income with food stamps, Medicaid or public benefits, compounding our overall challenge. News explainer: Health care's big four issues: What the justices are tackling . We need to create more jobs in America, address the need for home care, and improve the quality of care jobs all at the same time. In so doing, we can create precisely the type of economic growth we need in this moment. These are issues that concern us all including, ultimately, Supreme Court justices. Of course, the Supreme Court justices have lifetime appointments that include access to the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program, one of the largest insurance pools in the country, which ensures the jurists aren't subject to the sorts of limits for pre-existing conditions and inflated premiums that most insured Americans have long faced.  And if they choose to leave the bench, the justices can opt to keep their coverage -- meaning they won't have to rely on Medicare to nearly the extent most elder Americans do. News: Timeline of the health care law . But someday, they may want an in-home care worker to help them through the challenges of aging. The Affordable Care Act was a great leap forward in improving a health care system that isn't working well for senior citizens, workers or any of us. With our senior population growing by the second, or every eight seconds to be exact, we need to move forward quickly toward more improvements, not roll back the ones we've made. According to polls, the American people know that the Supreme Court won't rule based on the Constitution alone. Politics clearly influence such decisions. But if the justices would just think of themselves as senior citizens and soon-to-be-seniors, they would uphold the Affordable Care Act for the sake of older Americans, care workers and our shared future.

"Imagine: you are sitting with friends, one day in the distant future, in a space-age house, while robot servants cook dinner, fold laundry and mow the lawn. Inevitably the question arises: ""What was your first robot?"" For many -- 10 million, in fact -- the answer will be Roomba. The mini vacuum cleaning robot, launched in 2002, has become an everyday fixture in homes across the world -- earning pet-names from affectionate owners and a unique place among the internet's viral cat videos. Colin Angle, who co-founded manufacturers iRobot in 1990 with fellow MIT alums Rodney Brooks and Helen Greiner, hails Roomba as ""the world's first practical home robot."" The company is now hoping to infiltrate the boardroom with its wandering ""AVA"" telepresence robot, and the battlefield with its line of defense machines. Angle sat down with CNN's Nick Glass to talk about making the sci-fi world of robots a reality. CNN: What got you into robotics? Angle: I had grown up with Hollywood concepts of robots, and the labs that Dr Brooks and I worked in were focused on trying to make it real. In fact, our first business model was to send a robot to the moon and sell the movie rights. We actually got quite far. It didn't ultimately succeed but it did get us going, and the Spirit and Opportunity rovers were impacted by the work we'd done. It was very cool but not a great business. How did you go against the movies' concepts of robots? Hollywood likes to imagine robots as mechanical copies of ourselves -- which is a terrible idea. What did everyone think robot vacuuming was going to be? Well, they think Rosie the Robot from ""The Jetsons,"" a human robot that pushed a vacuum. That was never going to happen. We know that robot vacuuming was top-of-mind in how robots were going to help our lives. Our challenge was that we knew how to make the intelligence inexpensive -- but we didn't know how to vacuum. How did you learn to make Roomba? We entered the toy industry: we partnered with Hasbro building robot baby dolls and robot dinosaurs. They taught us how to manufacture very complicated electric mechanical things at a low price. We partnered with Johnson Wax, the guys that make the industrial cleaning machines, and we built giant robot cleaning machines. We were also building robots for the Pentagon to clear minefields. Using that intelligence technology actually gave us the algorithms which Roomba uses to make sure [your home] is thoroughly vacuumed. How did you name your machine? Naming is something not necessarily best left to an engineering organization. We had a contest inside iRobot to figure out what we should name the robot and the best we brilliant engineers could come up with was the ""Cyber Suck."" What's the future? If you think about what robots are supposed to do in our future, we're just about half of the way there. They can vacuum, they can scrub your floors -- but what about my laundry? What about all these other things that robots are supposed to do? What's the next big need? Well, I think it has to do with extending independent living: allowing our ageing demographic to live independently in their homes for longer. What will the robot home of the future look like? You may have a menagerie of robots that move around and do things: you may want a robot to bring you a beverage. You're not going to talk to your vacuum cleaning robot: in fact you may never see your vacuum cleaning robot because ideally you come home every day and your floors are freshly vacuumed. You may have this robot whose mission in life is to interact with you: it can be a security guard, it can be a robot that a doctor could beam-in and control... [to] see your daughter who has scraped her knee. There's this human interface robot which ultimately will be at the epicenter of this robot enabled home.

"(CNN) -- Chilean officials declared a ""catastrophe"" in eight municipalities Wednesday after heavy snow blanketed communities and blocked roads in what the nation's interior minister called a ""white earthquake."" ""It has snowed more than ever,"" Curacautin Mayor Jorge Saquel told CNN Chile Tuesday. ""This is an anomaly. ... This worries us because the meteorologists assure us that new snowstorms are coming."" In the city of Lonquimay, officials said snow had piled more than 2.3 meters (7.5 feet) high. Interior Minister Rodrigo Hinzpeter on Wednesday called the situation a ""white earthquake"" and asked the country's military and public works officials to help citizens in some of the hardest-hit areas in the country's central Araucania region. ""This storm is strong and it is likely that in the coming days we could suffer from more bad weather fronts, more heavy snowfall, that make the situation even worse,"" Hinzpeter said. ""But of course when this occurs, our government will always be on the side of those who are suffering, using all the tools provided by our legal system."" Authorities said they were sending trucks filled with food to the region, along with military helicopters to reach people in remote areas. More than 6,500 people remained isolated Wednesday in Lonquimay, a town with many living in outlying, rural areas, CNN Chile affiliate Universidad Autonoma Television reported. Earlier this week, local officials said federal assistance had not arrived quickly enough. ""The settlers and people of Lonquimay are buried undered the snow. There are areas with more than 2.3 meters of snow and we have gone many days without being able to communicate with many of them,"" Lonquimay Mayor Guillermo Vasquez said in a statement Monday. ""The emergency director promised us two bulldozers to clear the roads. We have people who are isolated. ... Touching the snow, it is like glass,"" Saquel told CNN Chile. ""The machines and food should have arrived as soon as possible.""","NEW: Officials in one city say more than 2.3 meters of snow have fallen .

"New York (CNN) -- Two New York men accused of brutally beating an openly gay man have been indicted on hate crime charges, authorities said. The indictment filed Thursday morning charges defendants Daniel Aleman, 26, and Daniel Rodriguez, 21, both of College Point in Queens, New York, of 14-counts of assault and robbery as a hate crime, according to Queens District Attorney Richard A. Brown. If convicted, both men face up to 25 years in prison. Police say the two men shouted ""anti-gay remarks"" while viciously beating victim Jack Price, 49, as he left a 24-hour deli on College Point Boulevard in Queens in October 2009. After the assault, the two men stole Price's wallet and other personal property from his pockets. Price was treated at New York Hospital Medical Center of Queens for a broken jaw, several broken ribs, two collapsed lungs and a lacerated spleen. Aleman and Rodriguez are being held without bail. Their arraignment is scheduled for January 25. Ted Kasapis, attorney for Rodriguez, said he doesn't believe prosecutors will be able to prove ""any hate crimes here."" An attorney for Aleman could not be reached for comment.","Daniel Aleman and Daniel Rodriguez face 14 counts of assault, robbery as a hate crime .

"(CNN) -- If the still raging fires didn't destroy their homes, New Mexico residents could be done in by flash flooding this monsoon season -- the ravaged landscape heightening the danger, and likelihood, of mudslides and other problems. Despite rain over the weekend, the Las Conchas fire continues to burn around Los Alamos. Nearly 1,900 personnel have worked to contain 45 percent of a blaze that's scorched more than 146,000 acres and more than 100 buildings, according to the website of the federal Interagency Management Team that is overseeing the firefight. With monsoon season having just kicked off, more precipitation could help firefighters contain the wildfire, one of several still burning in the Southwest. Yet it is not all good news, as torrential downpours -- which will likely occur into September -- may also cause further ruin in already hard-hit areas. ""It will simply take just one thunderstorm in the right area of a burn scar to potentially have devastating affects,"" National Weather Service meteorologist Kerry Jones said. ""That could happen tomorrow or Tuesday, or a month from now, or both."" Robyn Broyles, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Department of Interior's Burned Area Emergency Rehabilitation team, explained that forests, shrubs and other flora generally mitigate the impact of monsoon rains. Such plant life largely has been charred and flattened by the weeks-long Las Conchas fire. And the fact that the fire has affected acres upon acres of hilly, mountainous terrain makes fast-moving mudslides even more dangerous -- and likely. ""There's no vegetation left on the landscape to keep the water in place when the monsoon hits,"" Broyles said. Jones added, in an e-mail to CNN, that ""severely burned soil can be a water repellent"" and effectively act like pavement, with water quickly flowing over it and bringing ash, silt, sand and assorted debris along with it. ""(Those mudslides) then may damage or destroy culverts, bridges, roads and buildings, potentially causing injury or death,"" he explained. That danger is imminent in northern and central New Mexico. A monsoon ""burst,"" meaning a period of intense rain, was expected Monday and Tuesday in the area that's been a hotbed for wildfires since last month, said Jones. That's why the weather service issued a flash flood watch into Monday evening for a large swath of New Mexico including the Jemez and Sangre de Cristo mountains. Between a half inch to an inch of rain could fall within 30 minutes at times. Still, even though it is now monsoon season, that does not mean that new fires couldn't break out or that old ones could not continue to spread. As Jones noted, there likely will be ""breaks"" over the summer with little to no precipitation, and possibly high temperatures and strong winds. On Sunday night at Los Alamos Airport, for instance, the humidity was 18% to 20%, the weather service said -- even though thunderstorms could hit within hours. That continued wildfire danger is why Albuquerque and Bernalillo County continue to keep the Bosque, Rio Grande Valley State Park and all open space areas closed to the public -- even with rains on the way -- the city's website reports.","The Las Conchas fire is 45 percent contained, having burned more than 146,000 acres .

"While most of us are familiar with the word ""meme"" as the 21st century's buzzword for the latest trends and multi-media conversations in social media, Internet memes actually have been in active circulation for decades. They existed long before the arrival of web 2.0, social networking and the so-called viral industry, back when 56K dial-up was your only key to the World Wide Web and even before that, during the bygone years of Usenet newsgroups. With this in mind, let's take a look back at the top 10 most classic Internet memes that have sprung up and defined our ""cyberculture"" as we once knew it. Leetspeak (1980s) ""1337speak,"" read as leetspeak, is a corrupt style of the English language marked by liberal interchanging of numbers and symbols in place of certain letters that arose from the so-called ""leet"" (""elite"") subculture of hackers in the late 1980s, and later, gamers in the 1990s. Though now considered an outdated vernacular, 1337speak established a way to ""be cool"" on the Internet and left many other lasting legacies in the online gaming world -- most notably ""n00bs"" (newbies) and ""getting pwned"" (owned). Godwin's Law (1990) In a telling sign that shows the Internet's penchant for arguing and mudslinging, one of the first Internet memes to be referred to as such is a piece of Usenet-era wisdom from Mike Godwin, who observed in 1990 that ""as an Internet discussion grows longer, the probability of a comparison involving Nazis or Hitler approaches one."" Since then, Godwin's Law has matured into an unspoken rule on message boards and forums that says: ""if you mention Hitler or the Nazis to advance your argument in a discussion thread, you've automatically ended and lost the debate."" Hamster Dance (1998) This very adorable (and equally obnoxious) homage to dancing hamsters went live in 1998 and quickly spread like a wildfire through newsgroups and e-mail chains, inspiring a series of copycats and parodies like ""The Pig Dance,"" The Matchstick Dance"" and even ""The Jesus Dance."" Though it may not look like much in comparison to ""Nyan Cat"" or ""Hamster on a Piano,"" the dancing hamsters were declared one of the biggest sensations the Internet had ever seen at the time, along with the legendary ""Dancing Baby."" All Your Base are Belong to Us (1998) Originally found in the opening dialogue sequence from the 1989 Japanese space shoot'em up game ""Zero Wing,"" this awkward translation of the phrase ""all of your bases are under our control"" swept across gaming message boards and forums in the late 1990s, giving rise to one of the first epic-scale ""Photoshop memes"" based on poorly translated quotes from Japanese video games and animes. Not surprisingly, a number of other funny ""Engrish"" moments from Nintendo video games were brought to light in the wake of ""All Your Base,"" including ""I am Error"" (The Legend of Zelda) and ""A Winner is You"" (Pro Wrestling). You're the Man Now, Dog (2001) It's impossible to talk about the state of Internet humor and remix culture in the early 2000s without bringing up the names of a few websites, one of them being YTMND.com. While the site first began as a humble monument to an awesomely awkward quote uttered by Sean Connery's character in the 2000 drama ""Finding Forrester,"" it inadvertently grew into a major creative hub for mash-ups and parodies of all things pop culture, like ""The Picard Song"" or ""Lindsay Lohan's Unchanging Facial Expressions."" Anonymous (2003) The word may nowadays ring a bell with headlines about hacktivism, DDoS (distributed denial-of-service) attacks and Internet vigilantes, but the movement actually started back in 2003 as a far less political group of users on 4chan's /b/ board who would occasionally pull mass pranks on other online communities for their own entertainment under the collective pseudonym ""Anonymous"" -- a label that was designated to every user on /b/ by default. In the following years, the group continued to build its notoriety through on-air prank calls and chat room raids, most notably the infamous Habbo Hotel invasion in 2006, until the launch of Project Chanology in 2008. FAIL (2003) Yet another classic genre of Internet humor that emerged at the turn of the century, this catch-all term quickly rose to favor in the early 2000s as people on the Internet began coming to terms with the fact that we love to laugh when others fail, a psychological behavior also known by the German word ""schadenfreude."" The resounding impact of FAIL in humor can still be felt in today's Internet memescape, as we continue to celebrate others' ineptitude through an evolving generation of emoticons and slang terms, such as *facepalm*, cringe and the look of disapproval. Badger Badger Badger (2003) ""Badger Badger Badger"" is a flash animation featuring an army of badgers dancing to a repetitive electronic song interspersed with occasional mentions of ""mushroom."" Created by Jonti Picking in 2003, the animation not only provided a springboard for Picking's cartoon site Weeble's Stuff, but also served as the gateway meme to the Internet's fondness for mind-numbingly repetitive tunes that continues to this day. See: Nyan Cat . LOLcats (2007) Just in case you forgot, this is the story of how cats became the lions of the animal memedom. By the mid-2000s, consumer-grade digital cameras pretty much had become a household staple, and with a stroke of genius on the meme factory of 4chan, thusly began the great invasion of the adorable and semi-literate cats, and their Cheezburgers, on the Internet. In addition to making cats ever so popular, LOLcats also put the Impact font on the map as the standard typeface of Internet humor. Rickrolling (2007) ""Rickrolling,"" or tricking someone into clicking a link under the impression it will lead to something interesting, but instead serenades the viewer with Rick Astley's ""Never Gonna Give You Up,"" led to the song became an unlikely hit over two decades after its release and brought the British singer back into the limelight. The meme also brought the concept of trolling into mainstream consciousness. There have been a number of successors to carry on this ""bait-and-switch"" tradition, some of the most popular choices being ""Trololo"" and the wheelchair cliff scene from ""Mac and Me.""","Celebrating 25 years of the World Wide Web, Ben Huh recalls some of its finest memes .

"Thirty-four years after his friend and songwriting partner John Lennon was shot and killed, Paul McCartney still remembers the jolt of his death. ""I just for days couldn't think that he was gone. ... It was just a huge shock,"" McCartney told UK talk-show host Jonathan Ross. Lennon was shot to death by Mark David Chapman on December 8, 1980, at the entrance to his New York apartment building, the Dakota. He was 40 years old and had just released ""Double Fantasy,"" an album with wife Yoko Ono, after five years away from the spotlight. McCartney, who was criticized at the time for his seemingly glib remark, ""It's a drag, innit?"" when asked for his reaction to the news, remembers being unable to process the loss for quite some time. ""I was at home, and I got a phone call. It was early in the morning. ... It was just so horrific. You couldn't take it in, and I couldn't take it in,"" he said. He had known Lennon since 1957, when both were teenagers, and thought of them like brothers -- a comparison Lennon agreed with. ""He's like a brother. I love him,"" Lennon said in his last interview. ""Families -- we certainly have our ups and downs and our quarrels. But at the end of the day, when it's all said and done, I would do anything for him, and I think he would do anything for me."" McCartney takes some comfort in the knowledge that he and Lennon, who had sniped at each other following the Beatles' split in 1970, had gotten to be friends again before Lennon's death. ""I'm so glad, because it would have been the worst thing in the world to have this great relationship that then soured and he gets killed, so there was some solace in the fact that we got back together. We were good friends,"" McCartney said. ""The story about the break-up, it's true, but it's not the main bit. The main bit was the affection.""","Paul McCartney on John Lennon's death: ""It was just a huge shock""

"Syria's opposition urged the United States to provide arms to rebel groups in a Thursday meeting with Secretary of State John Kerry at the U.S. mission to the United Nations. ""The US commitment of military support ... is vital, but it needs to happen fast, and in a way that allows us to defend ourselves and protect civilians,"" a statement from the Syrian National Coalition.  ""To deny us the right to self-defense is to risk that the regime will survive: thousands will be executed, the repression will continue without end."" The session between Kerry and coalition President Ahmad Jarba in New York City came as the United Nations announced more than 100,000 people have been killed in the Syrian conflict. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon called for a peace conference to stop the violence on both sides. ""We have to bring this to an end,"" Ban said in remarks before his meeting with Kerry. In addition to the deaths, Ban noted that ""millions of people have either been displaced or become refugees in neighboring countries."" A State Department official said Kerry and Jarba agreed that a ""political solution is the best path forward"" in the conflict. ""Secretary Kerry reiterated the ongoing commitment of the United States to helping end the bloodshed and suffering of the Syrian people,"" the official said. The conflict . Syria is wracked by a civil war in which a government dominated by minority Alawite Muslims is squaring off with rebels dominated by Sunni Muslims. This May, the United Nations reported that more than 1.5 million had fled for other countries because of the violence, while 4 million more had been displaced within Syria. Yet many remain, whether by choice or necessity, amid the bloodshed. And -- as has happened very day for more than two years -- more of them died Thursday. A car bombing rocked a square in Jaramana, which is about 5 kilometers southeast of Damascus, according to both opposition activists and state-run media. The attack left 17 dead and tens more injured, according to the opposition Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. Syrian state TV put the death toll at 10, with 70 others wounded, blaming the blast on an al Qaeda branch operating within its borders. Jaramana has a mostly Christian and Druze population known for backing the regime of President Bashar al-Assad. The Local Coordination Committees in Syria, a network of opposition activists, reported at least 50 died nationwide on Thursday, including 19 in Aleppo province and 18 in and around the war-torn Middle Eastern nation's capital.","The U.N.'s secretary-general calls for an end to the violence .

"Norman Bridwell, the creator of ""Clifford the Big Red Dog,"" has died, according to his publisher, Scholastic. Bridwell died December 12 in Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts. He was 86. According to Scholastic, Bridwell's ""Clifford"" books -- and there are dozens of them -- have sold millions of copies in 13 languages. Clifford also crossed over to television, starring on the PBS Kids series of the same name. A movie is due in 2016. ""Norman Bridwell's books about Clifford, childhood's most loveable dog, could only have been written by a gentle man with a great sense of humor,"" said Scholastic Chairman and CEO Dick Robinson. ""Norman personified the values that we as parents and educators hope to communicate to our children -- kindness, compassion, helpfulness, gratitude -- through the Clifford stories which have been loved for more than 50 years."" Clifford, an oversized, clumsy but good-natured dog whose curiosity sometimes gets him into mischief, was born in 1963. Bridwell originally wanted to name him ""Tiny,"" but his wife convinced him otherwise. Clifford's friend, Emily Elizabeth, takes her name from one of Bridwell's children. The original Clifford story was about a runty pup who grows into a gigantic dog thanks to Emily Elizabeth's care. Bridwell's manuscript was turned down by nine publishers before Scholastic put it out. ""Clifford, the Big Red Dog"" was succeeded by such titles as ""Clifford Gets a Job,"" ""Clifford and the Grouchy Neighbors"" and ""Clifford Follows His Nose."" Other Bridwell books include ""A Tiny Family"" and ""The Witch Next Door."" Bridwell is survived by his wife, Norma, his daughter Emily Elizabeth, his son Timothy and three grandchildren.

"Maj. Gen. Ralph Baker, commander of the Combined Joint Task Force-Horn of Africa, was fired March 28, according to a Washington Defense official. The command is headquartered in Djibouti and runs U.S. military operations in East Africa, including some counterterrorism operations. Baker, a two-star general, is appealing the firing, which was ordered by his boss, Gen. Carter Ham, the commanding general of all U.S. military operations across Africa. He was relieved of his duty for loss of confidence, three Defense officials told CNN. It's the second embarrassing dismissal of a high ranking officer involved in the U.S. military hierarchy in Africa in five months. Gen. William ""Kip"" Ward, the first four-star general to command U.S. military operations in Africa, was demoted for excessive spending from duty at U.S. Africa Command (Africom). He lost one star and retired a lieutenant general. Ward used his rank to shuttle his wife on shopping sprees, enjoyed a lavish beachfront trip and once accepted a Defense contractor's gift of going backstage to meet actor Denzel Washington.","The general was fired for loss of confidence .

"(CNN) -- The federal government will cut its greenhouse gas emissions 28 percent by 2020, President Obama announced Friday. ""As the largest energy consumer in the United States, we have a responsibility to American citizens to reduce our energy use and become more efficient,"" the president said in a statement. ""Our goal is to lower costs, reduce pollution and shift federal energy expenses away from oil and towards local, clean energy."" Obama signed an executive order in October requiring federal agencies to set their goals for reducing greenhouse gas emissions within 90 days. The order also called on agencies to increase energy efficiency, conserve water and reduce waste, among other things. The White House said the executive order will lead to new private sector jobs and drive long-term savings. Obama stressed the importance of energy efficiency in his State of the Union address Wednesday, saying ""the nation that leads the clean-energy economy will be the nation that leads the global economy, and America must be that nation."" ""We need to encourage American innovation,"" Obama said. ""And no area is more ripe for such innovation than energy."" In 2008, the federal government spent more than $24.5 billion on electricity and fuel. Achieving its goals for reducing greenhouse gas pollution would save $8 billion to $11 billion in avoided energy costs over the next decade, the White House said. The Obama administration is also pushing for comprehensive energy legislation from Congress that puts a price on carbon emissions, a ""cap and trade"" policy that uses market forces as an incentive for businesses to reduce carbon emissions.","Federal government to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 28 percent .

"Dublin (CNN)We might still not have jetpacks and flying cars, but another dangling promise of the technology world now seems one step closer. Virtual reality (VR) is a serious business, as confirmed by Facebook's acquisition of Oculus VR for $2 billion earlier this year. Now, the makers of the highly anticipated Oculus device seem on track to deliver a consumer model, which they say is ""many months,"" but not years, away. ""This is the beginning of consumer virtual reality,"" said Brendan Iribe, CEO of Oculus VR, referring to the company's latest prototype, called ""Crescent Bay."" Faster, lighter and equipped with headphones, the prototype offers the best performance to date, says Iribe, and a convincing peek into the world of virtual reality. ""It has very low latency, so when you're moving around it's not catching up with you, it's all happening instantaneously,"" Iribe told CNN, from the Web Summit technology conference, in Dublin. ""Suddenly you get to that threshold where everything comes together, a switch in your brain flips, and you're comfortable, you feel like you're there. We call it the power of presence."" Brave new world . Describing what VR feels like is a bit like explaining romance to someone who's never been in love. It is a difficult task. Going from traditional computer graphics and interactive environments -- such as those found in today's most advanced video games -- to the virtual reality offered by Oculus' latest technology is like stepping into a brave new world, where the senses are completely invested rather than simply engaged. There is a feeling of suspension and inevitability. The closest equivalent that one might have experienced before is something called ""the broken escalator phenomenon."" When you approach a broken escalator, despite being fully aware that it's not moving, your body still relays an odd sensation of imbalance as your stride, involuntarily, tries to conform to your experience of a moving one. Scientists have found this to be due to a ""dissociation between knowledge and action"" in the brain, and the process is in full swing when using the Oculus. You know full well that it is just a simulation, but when you are placed on top of a skyscraper, high up in the evening canopy of a rainy metropolis, your steps become uncertain and you seek the safety of a railing to hide behind. Vertigo can easily occur. A pet T-Rex viewed through the Oculus is at the same time endearing and terrifying, and a curious alien gives you the impression that you might become best friends in a matter of minutes. The short circuit in your senses makes the experience, well, technically real. It is a remarkable sensation, and probably the closest thing to lucid dreaming this side of falling asleep. ""The next step is to bring other people in there with you. Your friends will be there, and you'll believe they're there,"" Iribe told CNN. The ambition is to revolutionize the way we communicate. ""Imagine a pair of virtual reality sunglasses in the future, and everybody in the world is inside,"" said Iribe. ""All you have to do is put them on and you can be face to face with anyone. Think about the power and the impact that the telephone has had. The potential for this new platform is that it may be the biggest future platform of all time, maybe the final platform, because once you have virtual vision, what's next? It's hard to imagine what's next."" This is where Facebook comes in. ""If you're gonna put on these glasses and talk to your friends, you wanna trust your friend network, you wanna make sure that those are really your friends that you're talking to, and Facebook provides that kind of platform,"" explained Iribe. Since the acquisition, the company has gone from about 50 employees earlier this year to about 200, heading toward 250. ""Facebook has supercharged our recruiting, and these are some of the very best and brightest people in the industry that are joining us,"" said Iribe. Killer app . That still doesn't mean that every detail is set in stone. The device still has no input controls, and it's unclear whether they will come in the form of a traditional gamepad or some other type of interface. But most importantly, the killer app for VR is anyone's guess. ""We're just learning what VR is,"" said Iribe, and that's why the company is welcoming competition. ""It is still anybody's game,"" he said. ""We're excited for everybody to get involved, and we're hoping that the likes of Google and Microsoft and maybe Apple will one day get involved. They'll probably have to, to stay relevant in the next generation of computing."" Other possible applications include virtual tourism, real-time cinema experiences, immersive gaming and education. ""The Smithsonian Institution has more than 130 million items. They could be scanned and put into a virtual reality environment and you would believe they were in front of you,"" he said. Still, Iribe hopes that competitors will not at all costs try to beat Oculus to the market, putting out devices with poor performance that might alienate customers and ""poison the well."" VR technology already suffered a demise back in 1995, in what Oculus executives define as ""the nuclear winter of virtual reality."" Motion sickness and disorientation were extreme due to the technical constraints of the time. But even with today's advanced hardware, issues remain. ""We have two perceptual psychologists on board,"" Iribe said, ""and we expect that group to grow. All the effects you can get in real life you can now get in virtual reality, and that's really exciting but also something you want to be careful with, to make sure that it's not too intense an experience. ""We want it to be something that you can enjoy for a long period of time, without too much vertigo, or too much claustrophobia. We need a new set of experiences that touch on the emotional side, but not too much."" Interestingly, Iribe wants the Oculus Rift to be a beautiful object; even though the user does not see it, other people do, he says: ""The more beautiful the product is, the more likely you are to buy it. And the more elegant it gets, the more the form factor shrinks, the sooner we get to virtual reality sunglasses."" The idea that one day the headset will shrink down to the size of sunglasses, much like those used today to watch 3-D TV, carries an impact that goes beyond aesthetics. ""Computers and smartphones do not offer a very social experience,"" said Iribe. ""We have what I call 'cellphone zombies,' people who are staring down at their phone for a big part of their day.

"Police searching Justin Bieber's limo found illegal drugs and paraphernalia Tuesday, a police report said. ""Less than an ounce of suspected marijuana and two large glass smoking pipes containing suspected marijuana residue were found inside the vehicle,"" the investigation report by a Sandy Springs, Georgia, police officer said. Police said they searched his Cadillac Escalade on Tuesday evening after they found a camera inside that a photographer claimed was taken from him by Bieber's bodyguard, the report said. Justin Bieber's security guard and driver arrested . ""Due to the small amount, no charges were filed related to the marijuana,"" a police statement said. A representative for Bieber declined to comment about the police report or the arrest of Bieber's bodyguard, Hugo Hesny, on a felony theft charge. The Atlanta incident interrupted a relative calm three weeks in Georgia for the teen pop idol, who tweeted Tuesday that he was ""focused on the music.""  He also tweeted ""i love GA."" In contrast, Bieber's January was a whirlwind of controversy that included a DUI arrest in Miami, an assault charge in Toronto and a felony vandalism probe in Los Angeles. The People v. Justin Bieber: The singer's court cases . Jail video: Bieber off balance? Video of Bieber undergoing a sobriety test inside a Miami Beach police station on January 23 was released to the media Wednesday.  He appeared unsteady at times as he walked along a white stripe on the floor. Bieber failed a series of sobriety tests, including ""horizontal gaze,"" ""Romberg balance,"" ""walk and turn,"" ""finger to nose"" and ""one-leg stand"" tests, the Miami Beach police report said. The preliminary toxicology report on Bieber's urine sample said it tested positive for ""metabolite of THC,"" which indicates marijuana use, and alprazolam, the generic name for the prescription sedative Xanax. Bieber's Southern hideout? The aggressive paparazzi who routinely tail celebrities in Los Angeles have sometimes clashed with Bieber. The singer has been ticketed for speeding, which he blamed on his being chased by photographers. He was investigated but not charged two years ago after a photographer accused him of assault after a confrontation in Calabasas, California, where Bieber owns a mansion. Although a hip-hop recording center, Atlanta lacks the robust hoard of photographers that stakes out all corners of Hollywood. But Jason Winslow, a Miami-based photographer who sells his images through the Splash photo agency, traveled to Atlanta to cover Bieber. Winslow told police he was parked outside the Sandy Springs Funhouse, a north Atlanta ""family fun center,"" waiting for Bieber to emerge Tuesday afternoon when Hesny told him to leave. ""He continued to take pictures from further away,"" Officer K.D. Sawtell wrote.  ""Eventually, that same person chased him down in a Cadillac Escalade as Winslow fled in his Chevy SUV."" Hesny, 32, admitted to police that he opened Winslow's car door and took the camera, but he said had no intentions of keeping it, the arresting officer said.  He told police ""he just wanted to delete the pictures from the camera."" He tossed the camera in the back of another Bieber SUV and then drove away, he told police. Winslow's Nikon camera, which he valued at $10,000, was found when police stopped the other Escalade.  It was in that vehicle where the drugs were found, the police report said. The driver, who was arrested but later released without charges, told police that he was just a driver and knew not to ask his client questions, the arrest report said. Winslow did not respond to CNN calls for comment on the case. The arrest of his bodyguard doesn't seem to have dampened Bieber's spirits. He posted on his Instagram account a photo of a panda at Zoo Atlanta with the caption ""My bro"" early Wednesday.  Bieber also noted via Twitter that his 20th birthday is just days away -- Saturday. ""I love sleep,"" the singer tweeted Wednesday afternoon.","""Due to the small amount, no charges were filed,"" police say .

"(CNN) -- The U.S. Justice Department is reviewing a request from 13 states on how to acquire an execution drug no longer made in the United States and whether the federal government would share its supplies, a federal spokeswoman said Wednesday. The sole U.S. manufacturer of sodium thiopental, an anesthetic used as part of the lethal three-drug cocktail, announced last month that it would stop making the drug because the producer never intended it to be used to kill people. The U.S. shortage of sodium thiopental, also used as an anesthetic for brief surgical procedures, may force states to postpone executions and has forced them to look outside the country for a supply or come up with alternatives. Those substitutes haven't been without controversy. In December, Oklahoma used an anesthetic commonly used to euthanize animals to execute John David Duty for killing a cellmate. Additional controversy surfaced last week about the drug's shortage when six death row inmates filed a federal lawsuit seeking to prevent the Food and Drug Administration from importing the drug, saying the imports may be unsafe. In a letter last month to U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder, the attorneys general in 13 states said injection is the execution method in the majority of states with a death penalty, and protocols in those states use sodium thiopental, ""an ultra-short-acting barbiturate."" ""Sodium thiopental is in very short supply worldwide and, for various reasons, essentially unavailable on the open market,"" the letter said. ""For those jurisdictions that have the drug available, their supplies are very small -- measured in a handful of doses. The result is that many jurisdictions shortly will be unable to perform executions in cases where appeals have been exhausted and governors have signed death warrants. ""Therefore, we solicit your assistance in either identifying an appropriate source for sodium thiopental or making supplies held by the federal government available to the states,"" the letter said. Justice Department spokeswoman Alisa Finelli said Wednesday that federal officials have received the communication. ""We'll review the letter,"" she said. Oregon is one of the 13 states signing the letter and has run out of the execution drug, said spokesman Tony Green of the Oregon Department of Justice. ""It's pretty straightforward. We don't have a supply of the drug so we're looking for sources for them should we need them,"" Green said. Oregon, which hasn't had an execution since 1997, doesn't have any lethal injections scheduled, though more than 30 men are on death row, he said. All those cases are in various stages of appeal, he said. The other states signing the letter are Alabama, Colorado, Delaware, Florida, Idaho, Mississippi, Missouri, Nevada, Tennessee, Utah, Washington and Wyoming. Texas, which wasn't part of the letter, performs the most executions in the country and is also facing a shortage of the drug, said spokesman Jason Clark of the Texas Department of Criminal Justice. Texas has enough sodium thiopental to carry out this month's two scheduled executions, on February 15 and February 22, but the state's stock of the drug will reach its expiration date in March, Clark said. Texas has executions scheduled in April, May and July, he said. ""The agency is exploring all of its options at this point, including seeking an alternative source of sodium thiopental as well as seeking an alternative drug to use in a lethal injection process,"" Clark said. Switching to an alternative drug could be done administratively, but switching to a different execution method would require legislative approval, Clark said. ""If we were to go to a firing squad, that would be a change in the execution method"" requiring lawmakers' approval, Clark said. In their recently filed federal lawsuit, death row convicts are seeking an injunction barring future imports of the drug and removal of supplies of the drug already in possession of state governments. The lawsuit represents inmates in Arizona, California and Tennessee. The FDA continues to allow states to import ""bulk amounts"" of the drug for use in lethal injection without vetting it to ensure it meets regulatory standards, the lawsuit charges. ""The imported thiopental in question has not been listed with FDA, was manufactured by foreign companies that have not registered with FDA, and was exported by a wholesaler located in the United Kingdom,"" says the lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in the District of Columbia. ""FDA has not determined whether the thiopental being imported into the United States is safe and effective, whether the imported thiopental is adulterated or whether the imported thiopental is counterfeit,"" the suit says. An FDA spokesman declined to comment last week, citing the litigation.","Sodium thiopental is part of three-drug cocktail used in lethal injection .

"(CNN) -- President Barack Obama was due in Ghana Friday, generating excitement in the west African nation and envy among its neighbors with many seeing his visit as sending a message to governments over their poor records on stability. President Obama says he chose Ghana partly because of the country's commitment to democracy. Across Ghana, street vendors were stocking miniature American flags while citizens donned attire with pictures of the U.S. leader. ""People in Ghana are printing clothes for this occasion,"" said Adrian Landry, general manager of a beach hotel in the capital, Accra. ""The fact that his father is African and he picked us makes us special,"" he said. ""He is endorsing our strong democracy in Ghana. This is historic."" The president's visit to the nation is the third by a sitting American leader. Bill Clinton was the first U.S. president to visit Ghana in 1998 as part of a six-nation Africa tour. Obama's predecessor, George W. Bush, stopped there as part of a four-nation Africa tour during his last year of office. ""Bush received a positive response, but it does not compare to this,"" Landry said. Various prominent African-Americans, including Maya Angelou and Muhammad Ali, have made stops in the country. As Ghana basked in the glow, media across Africa asked different variations of the same question: Why not us? Obama summed up the answer in two words: democratic commitment. ""By traveling to Ghana, we hope to highlight the effective governance that they have in place,"" Obama said in an interview with AllAfrica.com, which highlights news from the continent. During his one-day visit, Obama will meet his Ghanaian counterpart, John Atta Mills, who took office in January. The peaceful election in the nation of 23 million is a far cry from recent votes in Zimbabwe and Kenya, where Obama's father hails from. The two countries plunged into postelection chaos last year, forcing leaders to form contentious coalition governments. Ghana, which was the first sub-Saharan country to gain independence, went through growing pains, including a staunch military rule, but emerged as a democracy in 1992. It gained independence from Britain in 1957. The nation has maintained a clean image in a continent known for conflict. The transfer of power after elections in recent years has often gone smoothly, earning the country international fans in a region where leaders are ousted kicking and screaming when their terms are over. Despite its progress, Ghana has its flaws. It remains dependent on international aid even with its abundant natural resources, including gold and cocoa. Its per capita income has barely doubled over the past 45 years, according to the World Bank. Meanwhile, as the country geared up for the visit by the first U.S. president with African roots, others watched from a distance. In Kenya, where Obama's father was from, the reviews were mixed. While some understood his choice, others blamed the ""snub"" on politics.  Watch why some in Kenya see Obama visit as a snub » . ""I don't like the fact that he is looking at everything from a political standpoint,"" said Kungu Waiganjo of Nakuru, a major city northwest of the capital, Nairobi. ""No government is perfect, and he should not punish politicians at the expense of the little people."" David Bulindah, 38, called Obama's choice a ""smart"" move. ""He is setting precedent for leaders that they should deliver what they promised,"" said Bulindah, a Kenyan who lives in Baltimore, Maryland. ""The fact that his father was from Kenya does not mean we should get golden spoons."" -- CNN's Tricia Escobedo contributed to this report.","People in Ghana wearing Obama clothing ahead of U.S. President's visit .

"Mexico City, Mexico (CNN) -- Mexican investigators have asked diplomats from El Salvador, Honduras, Ecuador and Brazil to help identify the bodies of 72 presumed migrants discovered at a ranch in northeast Mexico. The nationalities of the deceased have not yet been confirmed, according to a statement released by Mexican President Felipe Calderon's office late Wednesday. Brazil said its Foreign Ministry was informed there were at least four Brazilians among the dead, the official Agencia Brazil news service reported Wednesday evening. There was no further information about the identity of the dead Brazilians or exactly how many had been killed, the government-run news agency said. The statement by Calderon said the Mexican president ""strongly condemns the acts that caused the death of 72 people, suspected to be migrants,"" and said that drug gangs are repeatedly turning to extortion and kidnapping of migrants as their resources and recruits dwindle. ""This is a result of the activity of the state against them, which has significantly weakened the operational capacity of criminal groups,"" Calderon's office said. Initial reports indicated the migrants were headed to the United States. A surviving immigrant said he and the others were shot when they refused to work for a cartel, news reports said. It was not clear whether the cartel was smuggling the migrants or had abducted them. The Center for Strategic and International Studies, a bipartisan, nonprofit policy institute based in Washington, noted in an August report that human smuggling and other illegal activities are playing an increasingly important role as narcotraffickers diversify their activities. ""The drug cartels have not confined themselves to selling narcotics,"" the report said. ""They engage in kidnapping for ransom, extortion, human smuggling and other crimes to augment their incomes."" And the risk is increasing for Central and South American migrants crossing through Mexico to get to the United States, said Mexico's National Commission for Human Rights. An investigation by the commission showed that 9,758 migrants were abducted from September 2008 to February 2009, or about 1,600 per month. The bodies of the 58 men and 14 women discovered Tuesday were found above ground in a building on the ranch, which is about 14 miles (22 kilometers) from the town of San Fernando, near the border with Texas. The Mexican navy, which was called in to investigate the case, said it is one of the largest discoveries of bodies in Mexico's 4-year-old war on organized crime. Members of the Mexican navy were tipped off to the site after a man with a gunshot wound approached a military roadblock. The man said he had been injured by a criminal gang, according to a statement released by the navy. Mexico's attorney general's office identified the man as an Ecuadorian immigrant and said he had a bullet wound to the neck. ""The navy went to the area where the man came from and encountered gunfights. A naval officer was killed and three of the delinquents were killed,"" said an officer who answered the telephone at the navy's communication department. The officer, who was not authorized to speak on the record, declined to give his name. After the gun battle, authorities said, they found a stash of weapons, including 21 rifles, camouflage uniforms, bulletproof vests and four trucks. One of the vehicles had been disguised to look like a truck from the Ministry of National Defense, officials said. A preliminary investigation indicated the victims were illegal immigrants from Honduras, El Salvador, Brazil and Ecuador, said Alejandro Poire, spokesman for national security strategy. ""This discovery once again demonstrates the extreme danger and violence that Central Americans face on their treacherous journey north, as well as Mexican authorities' abject failure to protect them,"" Amnesty International said. ""Mexico must immediately investigate this massacre, bring the perpetrators to justice and establish the identities of those killed so that their families can be informed."" Wednesday's gruesome discovery came about a month after authorities in the neighboring state of Nuevo Leon discovered 51 bodies in nine mass graves. In that instance, investigators found charred remains, incinerated bone fragments and stains of fire on the ground where bodies were presumably burned in steel drums, the state-run Notimex news agency said. Similar mass graves have been discovered in the Mexican states of Guerrero and Quintana Roo since late May. Authorities have linked them to Mexico's ongoing drug war. Nuevo Leon and Tamaulipas, which border Texas, have seen a marked increase in drug violence this year due to an intensifying rivalry between the Gulf cartel and the Zetas gang, which was formerly the cartel's armed branch. More than 28,000 people have died in drug-related incidents since Calderon intensified the government's fight against drug cartels and organized crime after taking office in December 2006.","NEW: The dead are believed to be Central and South American migrants crossing Mexico .

"Yemen's president, a powerful rebel group and representatives of major political parties signed a ceasefire Sunday, the government announced. ""The document calls for an immediate ceasefire and ending all forms of violence,"" the written statement said. ""It also calls for the formation of a technocratic national government, which will work to enhance government transparency, implement economic reforms, in addition to continuing military and security reforms."" The U.N.-brokered deal will end a month of tense protests by Houthis that essentially halted life in the Yemeni capital and resulted in hundreds of people being killed or injured. The death toll over the last week in Sanaa exceeds 150, a senior Defense Ministry official said. Over the past 24 hours, at least 35 people have been killed, the majority of whom were government troops or Sanaa civilians. The official said at least 900 people were injured over the past week. On Sunday, hours before the sides agreed on the ceasefire, Houthi gunmen seized strategic military positions, including the Defense Ministry in Sanaa. The Interior Ministry ordered troops not to clash with Houthi militants. A senior Interior Ministry official explained that the government wanted no bloodshed, to ensure that the Houthis would sign the deal. Basindwa steps down . Prime Minister Mohammed Salem Basindwa gave in to the militants' demands for changes in the government and resigned Sunday, saying he did so for the best of Yemen. ""I do not want to be an obstacle in front of any ceasefire deal that takes place between President Abdurabu Hadi and Ansarullah (the Houthi political faction),"" said Basindwa in his resignation letter. Senior Houthi leader Zakaria Al Shami told CNN the Houthis stand behind Hadi to continue to lead the nation. ""Ansarullah never called to oust President Hadi and will work with him to ensure Yemen goes forward after the formation of the new government,"" said Al Shami. Houthi supporters have been rallying for almost a month, demanding that an approved oil subsidy reform be revoked and that the government step down. Until that happened, they said, they would not remove their tents from Sanaa and surrounding areas. Rebel fighters enter capital . As progress in talks with the government slowed last week, Houthis, who follow the Zaidi sect of Islam, called thousands of their fighters to enter Sanaa. Top military commander Ali Mohsen, who led the 2011 uprising against former President Ali Abdullah Saleh, evacuated the 1st Division Brigade after hundreds of Houthi fighters raided the compound in northern Sanaa, backed by heavy artillery. On Friday, dozens of Houthi militants attacked Yemen's state television headquarters with heavy artillery, burning down two main buildings, in an attempt to take over the premises. The headquarters, located in the northern region of Sanaa, has been one of numerous sites targeted by the fighters, who, as of Sunday, control the majority of districts in north Sanaa. The government cut off all phone and Internet lines nationwide for 12 hours Friday morning, complicating communication between Houthi fighters. Ansarullah spokesman Mohammed Abdulsalam denied the Houthis started the attacks, saying the State TV area was used to launch rocket attacks on Houthi supporters three miles away. ""Hills in the vicinity of the State TV were used by government forces to attack our supporters in Jiraf district and we wanted to ensure that does not happen again,"" said Abdulsalam.","Deal calls for a new, more transparent government .

"Three prominent Afghan women will make it clear to a crowd of legislators on Capitol Hill Tuesday that a crucial measure of success in Afghanistan will be what women and girls can accomplish after U.S. troops leave. If a woman is free to vote and determine her own future and a girl is free to get an education, then more than 12 years of American engagement have not been in vain. A strong Afghan woman is a defeat for the Taliban.  A determined Afghan woman who can vote will wrestle the country away from tribalism and promote democracy. An assertive Afghan woman will bring back the Afghanistan that once preached moderation and tolerance of all religions, a country where women were on par with men assisting in resolving political and ethical conflicts. But if girls are denied an education or forced into child marriages; if talented women cannot pursue their goals, then nothing will have changed for all of cost in blood and treasure the United States has spent. The women -- Suraya Paksad, founder of the Voices of Women Organization; Massouda Jalal, former Afghan minister of women's affairs and presidential candidate; and Sajia Behgam Amin, a gender and policy adviser who ran an underground school for girls in the Taliban era -- are warning legislators that the next two years before U.S. forces withdraw are crucial in developing methods to empower Afghan women and to create resilient communities. No time can be lost. Already the Taliban is regrouping and is poised to fill any power vacuum created by a weak government in Kabul. Warlords are forming coalitions to push back on the Taliban. Afghanistan could be heading toward civil war. Who will bear the brunt?  Women, whose rights can easily be traded off if they are not at the table when decisions are made. In a negotiation without women, if one side says it doesn't want schools for girls because Islam does not permit it, the other side may say sure, no problem. But if women are at the negotiating table, they can make the argument forcefully that Islam does not ban education for girls and that, in fact, Islam supports it. Karzai already has showed he cannot be trusted to support the rights of women by signing a clerical council's ""code of conduct"" for women, which, among other strictures, supports women's segregation, bans women's travel without a male guardian and gives husbands rights to beat their wives in certain circumstances. Seeing this looming threat to American war aims, last week Sens. Bob Casey, D-Pennsylvania, and Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, introduced the Afghan Women and Girls Security Promotion Act. It requires the Defense Department to produce a strategy to promote women's security during the transfer of power to Afghan forces. Casey said that is the only way to achieve our overall goal of a secure and stable Afghanistan. In consultation with Afghan women, we believe four things must be done before the United States loses its bargaining position in Afghanistan after our troops withdraw. Create a coalition of women leaders: A coalition of prominent Afghan women ought to be created with the mandate of providing counsel every time an issue of women's and girls' rights is on the negotiating table. Make sure women can vote: The United States must make sure that Afghan elections are not corrupt and that women actually get to vote.  Women will vote against the Taliban if they are free to go to the polls. But we must have election monitors to be sure their votes are not stolen. Imams must become advocates for women: As a deeply religious society, Afghanistan must solve its problems within a framework of Muslim beliefs. The people devoutly follow their imams and mullahs. Our experience shows that through an imam training program, they can become advocates for girls' and women's rights.  Expanding our support for these training programs will pay big dividends. Direct aid to support communities: Billions of dollars in U.S. aid will be squandered if Afghan women do not believe they are integral to the political and economic process. We have two years to redirect part of this aid to fortify communities so that Afghan women, imams and community leaders can resist the Taliban on their own terms. If Afghan women suffer again, it will be as if we went to war for no reason.  We must remember that we had three objectives for launching the Afghan war -- capturing Osama bin Laden, defeating al Qaeda and the Taliban and protecting Afghan women and their rights. If we walk away and allow Afghan women to be subjugated, we will have made the same mistake we made after we helped the Mujahedeen push the Soviets out of Afghanistan. We left the country in a power vacuum, which was filled by a radical fringe known as the Taliban. We know how badly that turned out.","Daisy Khan: A key measure of U.S. success in Afghanistan will be extent of women's rights .
Khan: If girls can't go to school, women can't reach goals, nothing will have changed .

"The world's animal population has halved in 40 years as humans put unsustainable demands on Earth, a new report warns. The World Wide Fund for Nature's Living Planet Index, released Tuesday, revealed the dramatic decline in animal species, and said the trend could cost the world billions in economic losses. Humans need one and a half Earths to sustain their current demands, it said. The index, which draws on research around WWF's database of 3,000 animal species, is released every two years. This year's has the starkest warning yet of the risks associated with the decline of wildlife. The fund notes that it's relying on a never-before-used methodology in this year's report, ""which aims to be more representative of global biodiversity."" The index showed shows a 52% decline in wildlife between 1970 and 2010, far more than earlier estimates of 30%. It is due to people killing too many animals for food and destroying their habitats. ""We are eating into our natural capital, making it more difficult to sustain the needs of future generations,"" the report said. Researchers from the Zoological Society of London looked at changes in populations of more than 3,000 species of mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians and fish, tracking over 10,000 different populations. Photos: Spectacular wildlife around the world . The decline in animals living in rivers, lakes and wetlands is the worst -- 76% of freshwater wildlife disappeared in just 40 years. Marine species and animals living on land suffered 39% decline in their populations. Animals living in tropics are the worst hit by what WWF calls ""the biggest recorded threats to our planet's wildlife"" as 63% of wildlife living in tropics has vanished. Central and South America shows the most dramatic regional decline, with a fall of 83%. And while the animals are suffering now, the long-term impact will be on people, the report said. Marco Lambertini, director general of WWF International, said ""protecting nature is not a luxury....it is quite the opposite. For many of the world's poorest people, it is a lifeline."" According to Lambertini, the threat to oceans could create economic losses of up to $428 billion by 2050. The global fishing sector employs more than 660 million people, and fish provide more than 15% of protein in people's diet. Global food security is under threat as the demands of growing population drain the resources. Forests provide water, fuel and food for more than  billion people, including 350 million of the world's poorest people.","WWF said 52% of wildlife disappeared between 1970 and 2010 .

"Ali Abdullah Saleh clung to power in Yemen for 33 years, navigating -- and even channeling -- the country's complex tribal power structure. Rebellions, droughts and crises came and went, but Saleh never did, deftly playing rivals off each other to rule his fractious land, an act he once called ""dancing on the heads of snakes."" On Wednesday, the 69-year-old ruler signed an agreement in Saudi Arabia transferring executive powers to the country's vice president, Abdo Rabu Mansour Hadi. Although he retains his title as president for up to 90 days, the agreement would appear to end Saleh's rule after more than three decades. Born in 1942 in Bayt al-Ahmar to the country's powerful al-Hashid tribe, Saleh never finished elementary school. He joined the army of the former Kingdom of Yemen at 16, and five years later was commissioned a second lieutenant in the army of North Yemen. In 1974, Saleh participated in a coup that put a military council in charge of the country, and four years later ascended to the presidency after the previous leader, Ahmed Hussein al-Ghashmi, was assassinated. When North Yemen and South Yemen reunited in 1990, Saleh became president of the new country and remained in power for the next 21 years, playing tribal rivalries off one another and remaining an ally of the West despite the lingering presence of al Qaeda in the Arab Peninsula in Yemen. Then came the Arab Spring. Inspired by protests in Tunisia that forced the country's president, Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali, to relinquish power after 23 years, demonstrations spread across the Middle East and North Africa, eventually toppling the regimes of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi. The protests spread to Yemen, too, with small demonstrations in January growing larger as the weeks went on. They culminated in mass protests calling for Saleh's resignation despite his promises first to reform the constitution and later assurances that he would step down in 2013 and would not try to transfer power to his son. The protests continued into spring and summer, spreading across the country and often resulting in violent clashes with security forces. Hundreds of protesters died in brutal crackdowns that attracted worldwide attention. Saleh had said since May that he would sign the agreement brokered by the Gulf Cooperation Council that calls for him to step down in exchange for immunity, but repeatedly he balked. In June, Saleh's rule seemed to be at an end when he was injured in an assassination attempt at his palace mosque. He traveled to Saudi Arabia to seek medical treatment, leading some to speculate his regime was over. But in September, to the surprise of many, he returned to take back the reins of power. On Wednesday, as he has before, he appeared to reverse course, telling the television station France 24 that he had no more desire to stay in power. ""Whoever hangs onto power I think is crazy,"" he told the station. But unlike previous meetings with the Gulf Cooperation Council, this time, Saleh traveled to Saudi Arabia to sign the deal. If Saleh's rule is truly over, it's unclear what he will do next. A presidential source said before the signing that Saleh will stay in Saudi Arabia. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said Saleh told him he will instead seek medical treatment in New York. Another Yemeni government official said whatever happens is anyone's guess. ""Everything's unpredictable with Saleh,"" the official said.","Yemeni president emerged from powerful tribe to rule his country for 33 years .

"On Thursday, Groupon founder and CEO Andrew Mason summed up his day, and perhaps an entire niche industry, with a joke. ""I've decided that I'd like to spend more time with my family,"" he said in a companywide memo. ""Just kidding -- I was fired today."" Mason made some decisions while running the daily-deals site that can certainly be questioned. Refusing a reported $6 billion buyout from Google in favor of what would turn out to be a tepid stock offering, for one. (It was trading Friday for about $5). Approving those dubious Super Bowl ads two years ago was another. But his unceremonious ouster from the company he created speaks, too, to how online and mobile coupons -- for a brief, shining moment the darlings of the tech world -- have fallen out of favor. LivingSocial laid off 400 workers in November, not long after Amazon reported it had lost $169 million due to investing in the company. Last year, Atlanta-based mobile app Scoutmob took a unique tack, appealing to investors by announcing that its creators never considered it a ""daily deals"" tool. So, what happened? Here are four factors that have contributed to the decline of the daily deal ... and one that could help it survive. 1. Spam . Groupon spawned a glut of copycat services. And let's face it, once you signed up for a pile of deals sites, that meant a pile of e-mail in your inbox every day. As a harried digital world began dreaming of the Internet's white whale -- ""Inbox Zero"" -- people got tired of looking at one offer after another, especially at a time when some folks found their paychecks stretched so thin that even 25% off of a restaurant meal was outside their budgets. The barrage got so bad that at least one tool was created to combat it. UnsubscribeDeals.com offers one simple service: the sometimes-tricky task of getting you off of the mailing lists of major deals sites. You can then opt for a single e-mail, weekly, with personalized offers. ""The industry, and Groupon specifically, received a lot of attention over this 18-month period. They got a lot of press, they spent a lot of marketing dollars getting users,"" said Unaiz Kabani, product manager for daily-deals analysts Yipit. ""What they did is sign up way more customers than are going to actually be interested in the product. ""Those are the ones that are just kind of viewing the e-mails as spam."" 2. Irrelevance . With four or five, or more, deals hurtling toward you every day, what are the odds you're going to be interested in most of them? The law of averages says they're not very high. Don't need your teeth whitened? Bungee jumping not your thing? Not sure your slow-pitch softball team would appreciate you skipping practice for Bikram yoga? If you have to wait weeks for something interesting, eventually you'll lose patience. (Note: See item five for hope on this front.) 3. Angry businesses . Research done by Yipit showed that about 90% of businesses that used Groupon and LivingSocial were satisfied with the experience, Kabani said. But in the daily-deals heyday, stories started surfacing from businesses, particularly restaurants, saying the digital coupons were a bad bargain. Customers who showed up for a deeply discounted meal never came back to pay full price, presumably having moved on to the next bargain. Deal-seekers were regularly bad tippers. One cafe owner in Portland said she lost $8,000 on a Groupon deal. At the time, businesses couldn't cap the number of Groupons the site could sell, and she got clobbered by tons of people taking her up on an offer for $13 worth of service for $6. (Mason, to his credit, heard her story and offered to ""make things right."") As we noted, that wasn't the majority of businesses. But a spate of stories like that made some merchants think twice about signing up. 4. Deal fatigue . The Internet is a ""been there, done that"" sort of place. While 2010 and 2011 brought us stories of daily-deal addiction, 2012 and 2013 have brought more about daily-deal burnout. From ""Draw Something"" to location-based games to those funny Facebook quizzes, what's hot today on the Web can  be virtually gone tomorrow. We're looking at you, ""Harlem Shake."" 5. Hope for the future? Adapt or die. It's the law of the jungle, and the digital marketplace. Kabani notes that Groupon actually had pretty good results last quarter. One thing they've done is become more of a buffet and less of a blue-plate special. Users can now go to the Groupon site and search for something they're actually interested in, rather than just waiting to see what pops into their inbox. ""Instead of just one daily deal, they're creating this open-ended marketplace that's done really well,"" he said. ""Say you're looking for a massage deal or to get a haircut. You can go to Groupon now and find something like what you're looking for."" As noted above, Scoutmob scored a few million dollars in investments last year by positioning itself as a more well-rounded mobile company than some deals sites. ""The industry matured really, really quickly; that's kind of when you saw that hyper growth period,"" Kabani said. ""It's obviously not in that space any more. They're in the optimization mode ... trying to understand how to best optimize their subscribers.""","Groupon founder's ouster highlights the struggles of daily-deals services .

"(CNN) -- Celebrated Norwegian artist Edvard Munch's life was fraught with anxiety and hallucinations. The painter, who died 70 years ago today, created one of the most recognized masterpieces in history, ""The Scream"", which came to him in a sinister vision as he stood on the edges of Oslofjord. ""The sun began to set - suddenly the sky turned blood red,"" he wrote. ""I stood there trembling with anxiety - and I sensed an endless scream passing through nature."" The painting is thought to represent the angst of modern man, which Munch experienced deeply throughout his life, but saw as an indispensable driver of his art. He wrote in his diary: ""My fear of life is necessary to me, as is my illness. They are indistinguishable from me, and their destruction would destroy my art."" Munch may be one of the most high profile artists to walk the line between extreme talent and torment, but he is not the only one. Vincent van Gogh, who cut of his ear after an argument with his friend Paul Gauguin, and later killed himself, swayed heavily between genius and madness. In a letter to his brother Theo in 1888 he wrote: ""I am unable to describe exactly what is the matter with me. Now and then there are horrible fits of anxiety, apparently without cause, or otherwise a feeling of emptiness and fatigue in the head... at times I have attacks of melancholy and of atrocious remorse."" These painters' personal struggles still echo in popular culture today, and have given rise to the belief that artists are more susceptible to a range of mental illnesses, including bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. A growing body of research suggests that there is merit to that popular assumption. Madness may lurk where creativity lies. The dark side of creativity . Psychologists have been fascinated by the potential link for decades. The earliest and most rudimentary studies examined eminent people across fields including literature and the arts. These studies found that creatives had an unusually high number of mood disorders. Charles Dickens, Tennessee Williams, and Eugene O'Neill all appeared to suffer from clinical depression. So too did Ernest Hemingway, Leo Tolstoy and Virginia Woolf. Sylvia Plath famously took her own life by sticking her head in an oven while her two children slept. Critics rightly pointed out that these studies focused on very specific groups of high-achievers, and that they relied on anecdotal evidence. Subsequent studies have cast the net wider. Simon Kyaga led a team of researchers at Sweden's Karolinska Institute. Read more: Life of a muse: What is it like to inspire art for a living? Using a registry of psychiatric patients, they tracked nearly 1.2 million Swedes and their relatives. The patients demonstrated conditions ranging from schizophrenia and depression to ADHD and anxiety syndromes. They found that people working in creative fields, including dancers, photographers and authors, were 8% more likely to live with bipolar disorder. Writers were a staggering 121% more likely to suffer from the condition, and nearly 50% more likely to commit suicide than the general population. They also found that people in creative professions were more likely to have relatives with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, anorexia and autism. That is significant. Earlier studies on families have suggested that there could be an inherited trait that gives rise to both creativity and mental illness. Some people may inherit a form of the trait that fosters creativity without the burden of mental illness, while others may inherit an amped-up version that stokes anxiety, depression and hallucinations. There is anecdotal evidence supporting the connection. Albert Einstein's son lived with schizophrenia, as did James Joyce's daughter. Keri Szaboles, a psychiatrist at Semmelweis University in Hungary, has studied the role genes may play more directly. Szaboles gave 128 participants a creativity test followed by a blood test. He found that those who demonstrated the greatest creativity carried a gene associated with severe mental disorders. Method in the madness? Psychologists have established a link between mental illness and creativity, but they are still piecing together the mechanisms that underlie it. In September neuroscientist Andreas Fink and his colleagues at the University of Graz in Austria published a study comparing the brains of creative people and people living with schizotypy. Read more: Art and fashion, new BFFs? Schizotypy is a less severe manifestation of schizophrenia. People with the condition may demonstrate odd beliefs (like a belief in aliens) or behavior (like wearing inappropriate clothes). Unlike schizophrenics, they do not have delusions and are not disconnected from reality. Fink and his team recruited participants demonstrating low and high levels of schizotypy. They then slid them into a functional magnetic resonance imaging machine, and asked them to come up with novel ways of using every day objects. They later assessed the originality of their responses. An interesting pattern emerged. Among those high in schizotypy and those who scored highest on originality, the right precuneus - a region of the brain involved in attention and focus - kept firing during idea generation. Normally this region deactivates during a complex task, which is thought to help a person focus. Put more simply, the results suggest that creatives and those with high levels of schizotypy take in more information and are less able to ignore extraneous details. Their brain does not allow them to filter. Scott Barry Kaufman, an American psychologist and writer for Scientific American, has summed up the results this way. ""It seems that the key to creative cognition is opening up the flood gates and letting in as much information as possible,"" he writes. ""Because you never know: sometimes the most bizarre associations can turn into the most productively creative ideas."" Clearly some people suffer for their art, and clearly some art stems from suffering. But it would be inaccurate to say that all creatives run the risk of mental illness. Kyaga, the Swedish academic, points out that dancers, directors, and visual artists demonstrated mental illnesses less frequently than the general population.

"Soccer legend Pele joked with reporters Tuesday after he was discharged Tuesday from a Sao Paolo, Brazil, hospital. ""I was worried, but I never feared I'd die. Because I am from Tres Coracoes, (""I have three hearts""), it will be difficult for me to die,"" the three-time World Cup winner said. ""But my doctor warned me that I very nearly lost one of my hearts back there."" Pele, born Edson Arantes do Nascimento, was moved out of intensive care on Sunday, Albert Einstein Hospital said. Pele, 74, had been hospitalized since November 24 and had kidney dialysis for several days. He said he was surprised by the outpouring of love from his fans worldwide. ""I received messages from China, Pakistan, all over Europe,"" he said ""I didn't know everyone was paying attention to my situation."" The athletic icon had one kidney removed during his days as a player, his aide, Jose Fornos Rodrigues, said last week. ""When I went to play at Cosmos, I wasn't feeling well, and the doctor told me I was playing for a while with just one kidney. He said I had both inside but only one working. That's why I had surgery in New York and nobody found out about it,"" Pele said Tuesday. Known as ""The Black Pearl"" and simply ""The King,"" Pele is one of the best known names in all of sports. He burst onto the scene as a teenager, helping lead his native Brazil to the 1958 World Cup championship. Pele went on to star on two other World Cup title teams as well, in 1962 and 1970, in addition to a breakthrough career with the Brazilian club Santos and later with the New York Cosmos of the now-defunct North American Soccer League. In 2000, he and Argentina's Diego Maradona were named co-Players of the Century by FIFA, the international soccer governing body. Santos named him a lifetime ambassador for the club, Pele told fans this week. ""It is exciting to know that I will be wearing the shirt of my favorite team for the rest of my life,"" he wrote on Twitter. ""I expect to keep bringing pride and joy to Santos fans all around the world."" Even after retiring from football, Pele has remained in the public eye as a product pitchman, ambassador for the sport of football and advocate for Brazil's poor, having grown up among them in Tres Coracoes.","Pele spent 15 days in the hospital .

"(CNN) -- A strong earthquake measuring 6.1 in magnitude struck southern Iran on Wednesday, according to a report from the U.S. Geological Survey. The citadel at the city of Bam, Iran in 2005, hit by a quake in 2003 when 30,000 people died. The quake demolished nearly 200 villages in Iran's Hormozgan Province, according to Iran's Press TV, citing the head of the provincial disaster management headquarters, Yasser Hazbavi. At least six people were killed and 46 others were injured, Hazbavi told Press TV. People panicked and fled buildings when the temblor struck in the quake-prone region around 3:30 p.m. Iranian time (1100 GMT), Iran's state-run IRNA news agency reported. It also knocked out power to the region.  See map of quake's epicenter » . The epicenter was located 35 miles (55 km) west-southwest of Bandar e-Abbas, Iran --  just across the narrow Strait of Hormuz from the United Arab Emirates -- according to USGS. Mehdi Rezapoor, head of the Iranian Seismological Center, said it was ""a medium-sized quake."" Speaking on Press TV, Rezapoor had no details on damage, but said that based on the quake's strength, ""I don't think it was very extensive."" The quake shook nearby Dubai, where CNN staff members said they felt the building they were in shake for about 15 to 20 seconds. ""From my office window at the Dubai Media City where all foreign media are located, I can see that a lot of offices have evacuated buildings,"" CNN Dubai Bureau Chief Samson Desta said. ""I can see up to perhaps 200 people who have taken refuge out in the streets, causing somewhat of a traffic jam."" There was no evidence of any damage in Dubai, where there are a lot of high-rise buildings. Iran lies on a series of seismic fault lines and has experienced devastating earthquakes -- most notably in December 2003 when a 6.6 magnitude quake devastated the ancient city of Bam in southeast Iran, killing at least 30,000 people.","Strong quake measuring 6.1 in magnitude strikes southern Iran .

"London, England (CNN) -- A Muslim scholar has issued a fatwa, or religious ruling, that says suicide bombers are destined for hell. Muhammad Tahir ul-Qadri condemned terrorism and criticized Islamic extremists who cite their religion to justify violence. Ul-Qadri's 600-page fatwa is ""arguably the most comprehensive theological refutation of Islamist terrorism to date,"" according to the Quilliam Foundation, a London organization that describes itself as a counterterrorism think tank. ""Terrorism is terrorism,"" ul-Qadri said at a news conference hosted by the foundation. ""Violence is violence. It has no place in Islamic teaching, and no justification can be provided to it ..."" Ul-Qadri is the founder of the Minhaj-ul-Quran, an organization with hundreds of thousands of followers in South Asia and the United Kingdom, according to the Quilliam Foundation. The foundation refers to ul-Qadri as a mainstream Muslim scholar who is a ""widely recognized and respected authority on Islamic jurisprudence."" He criticized Muslims who, in justifying terrorism, say it furthers the goal of correcting wrongs done to Muslims. ""No good intention -- even one thousand good intentions put together -- cannot justify a wrong and forbidden act,"" he said. ""Good intentions cannot convert a wrong into good."" Some extremists have interpreted the Quran to suggest that those who kill in the name of Allah will be rewarded after death with 72 virgins and a place in paradise.","Suicide bombers are destined for hell, author declares in a 600-page fatwa .

"(CNN) -- A U.S. soldier captured in Afghanistan in 2009 has received his second promotion while in captivity, U.S. Central Command announced Friday. With the promotion, Bowe Bergdahl, 25, rises to the rank of sergeant. He was last promoted in June 2010 to the rank of specialist, according to Central Command. Brig. Gen. Rick Mustion, the adjutant general of the Army, traveled to Bergdahl's hometown of Hailey, Idaho, on Thursday to deliver the promotion certificate to his parents. The Army has been giving Bergdahl promotions that would have come to him had his Army career gone as planned. If he returns home safely, the Army will give him all the back pay that he has earned while in captivity. Bergdahl was a private first class when he disappeared in June 2009, after finishing his guard shift at a combat outpost in southeastern Afghanistan's Paktika province. He has been seen in several videos released by the Taliban. His whereabouts today are unknown, though some security analysts say it is likely he is in Pakistan. In December, Bergdahl appeared in footage released by Manba al-Jihad, a video production group associated with the Taliban. A speaker said the Paktia mujahedeen captured the soldier, and he is in the custody of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan (the Taliban) and has all ""Islamic rights."" In the nearly 45-minute video, Bowe Bergdahl wears an open-necked tan shirt and has a large abrasion on his left cheek, just below the eye. Bergdahl's father, Robert Bergdahl, made his first public appeal last month for his son's release, using a YouTube video recording to address the Taliban and its allies. In the video, the elder Bergdahl also conveyed ""compassionate respect"" to the people of Pakistan, who have endured war, earthquakes, floods and crop failures. He concluded the video with a message to his son: ""God bless you! We love you! We have been quiet in public, but we have not been quiet behind the scenes. Continue to be patient and kind to those around you. You are not forgotten. You are not forgotten."" Bergdahl is assigned to 1st Battalion, 501st Parachute Infantry Regiment, 4th Brigade Combat Team, 25th Infantry Division, Fort Richardson, Alaska. CNN's Larry Shaughnessy contributed to this report.","Bowe Bergdahl disappeared in June 2009 in Afghanistan .

"Yemen is going through its greatest upheaval since protests erupted during the Arab Spring more than three years ago. Only this time, it's not a cry for democracy but a bitter sectarian battle for power -- pitching al Qaeda and other Sunni groups against Shia Houthi rebels. The Houthi -- whose stronghold is northern Yemen -- swept into the capital, Sanaa, a month ago, where they met little opposition. Since then, they've taken control of Yemen's second port, Hodeida, on the Red Sea. Now they're trying to challenge al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) in its heartland in central Yemen. Hundreds of Houthi fighters converged on the provinces of Ibb and al Bayda in recent days. Yemeni Interior Ministry officials tell CNN Houthis have taken heavy casualties because of roadside bombs planted by AQAP. ""Houthis are used to military clashes, while al Qaeda uses guerrilla tactics against its enemies,"" said Abdul Salam Mohammed, president of the Abaad Strategic Center in Sanaa. Officials estimate that at least 75 people have been killed in fighting since Saturday, the great majority of them Houthis -- including 22 killed by a roadside bomb Monday in the town of Rada'a. There were further clashes in the town Tuesday, with AQAP claiming it inflicted heavy casualties on Houthi fighters. AQAP has taken control of the town of Al Odayn in neighboring Ibb province, as Yemen threatens -- again -- to become a patchwork of rival fiefdoms where the central government has little influence. Al Qaeda claims that some Sunni tribes have joined it in repelling the Houthi incursions. Writing in Al Monitor, commentator Maysaa Shuja al Deen says AQAP is ""forging political alliances with tribes that view the Houthis as enemies... Indeed, the organization has expanded to new areas in response to Houthi control."" Jalal BalEidi, a senior figure in AQAP, said the group will confront the Houthis' advance, in what appears to be a new front in the larger Shia/Sunni struggle across the Middle East. The Houthis have long complained that they have been marginalized and persecuted by Yemen's Sunni majority, and have been involved in series of rebellions since 2004. But never before have they taken so much territory across such a wide area of central and northern Yemen. They are demanding a substantial presence in a new government and a voice in the writing of a new constitution. After taking control of ministries, the state television headquarters and other government facilities in Sanaa last month, Houthi leaders signed a peace agreement with President Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi. But their presence has sparked protests among hardline Sunni parties and groups and has given al Qaeda a new rallying call. Al Deen says the agreement tried ""to legitimize the fall of the capital and cover the truth on the ground, which is the collapse of the Yemeni state and its replacement by militia forces taking control of its streets and expanding militarily to the rest of the country's provinces."" Adding to an increasingly volatile situation, a secessionist movement in the south of Yemen, al Hirak, is stepping up protests in Aden, Yemen's chief port and the largest city in the south. Al Qaeda resurgent in Yemen amid political turmoil . For Washington, Yemen's descent into a conflict of many groups -- whose alliances can change quickly and unpredictably -- is the worst-case scenario. For al Qaeda, it is fertile ground. In some ways, events in Yemen, with outside powers all jockeying for advantage, are beginning to mirror the disintegration of Syria.","Houthi rebels battle al Qaeda-linked group for territory in Yemen .

"(CNN) -- The world has inched further away from doom and nuclear disaster, said a group of respected scientists that includes 19 Nobel Laureates. The symbolic Doomsday Clock has been moved back a minute, reflecting the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists' more optimistic view of the world's chances of avoiding catastrophic threats such as nuclear attacks. The clock is now set at six minutes to midnight, with midnight representing a nuclear apocalypse, according to the group, which is based in Chicago, Illinois. ""We are poised to bend the arc of history toward a world free of nuclear weapons. For the first time since atomic bombs were dropped in 1945, leaders of nuclear weapons states are cooperating to vastly reduce their arsenals and secure all nuclear bomb-making material,"" the scientists said in a statement Thursday. The Doomsday Clock was created in 1947 and had been adjusted only 18 times before Thursday, the group said. The closest it has been to midnight is two minutes, from 1953 to 1960, after the Soviet Union and the United States stepped up testing of thermonuclear devices. The farthest has been 17 minutes, from 1991 to 1995, after the signing of the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty. ""A key to the new era of cooperation is a change in the U.S. government's orientation toward international affairs, brought about in part by the election of [President Barack] Obama,"" the group said. ""With a more pragmatic, problem-solving approach, not only has Obama initiated new arms-reduction talks with Russia, he has started negotiations with Iran to close its nuclear enrichment program, and directed the U.S. government to lead a global effort to secure loose fissile material in four years. ""He also presided over the U.N. Security Council last September, where he supported a fissile material cutoff treaty and encouraged all countries to live up to their disarmament and nonproliferation obligations under the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty,"" said the group, which added that much more work needs to be done. Threats remain around the world, the scientists said, noting that governments might not live up to pledges to reduce nuclear arms and combat climate change. Scientists and other experts who had produced the atomic bomb for the Manhattan Project established the group in 1945, its Web site said.","Clock is now set at six minutes to midnight, Chicago-based group says .

"CHICAGO, Illinois (Reuters)  -- Grammy Award-winning R&B singer R. Kelly will go on trial September 17 on child pornography charges, five years after the accusations were first made, prosecutors said Wednesday. Jury selection in R. Kelly's trial is scheduled to begin September 17. Kelly, 40, whose real name is Robert Kelly, faces up to 15 years in jail if convicted of videotaping himself having sex with an underage girl. Prosecutors have said the girl could have been as young as 13, but defense attorneys have disputed her age and whether Kelly is on the tape. The underground videotape was widely circulated. Kelly pleaded not guilty to the charges and in the interim has released hit songs, gone on tours, and released a DVD set of ""hip-hopera"" skits. Cook County Judge Vincent Gaughan said jury selection would begin September 17. The trial was delayed, in part, by arguments over when the video was made. It was also pushed back because the judge fell and broke bones and needed to recuperate. E-mail to a friend . Copyright 2007 Reuters.

"(CNN) -- Who could've ever predicted that 140 characters could screw up so many people's lives? But that's exactly what has happened to politicians, executives, government staff and others because of their comments on Twitter. This social media platform has morphed from a fun place to an information hub to a career killer. And astoundingly, even people who work in PR -- you know, the folks who are supposed to advise clients on how to avoid social media disasters -- can tweet out statements that cause a media uproar. We saw that this weekend when Justine Sacco -- who at that time was a PR executive -- tweeted shortly before her 12-hour flight to South Africa on Friday: ""Going to Africa. Hope I don't get AIDS. Just kidding. I'm white!"" Those 64 characters tweeted by Sacco resulted in her now being known as ""ex-PR executive."" Sacco was fired by IAC, the media company headed by Barry Diller, within hours of landing in South Africa. The lesson here is clear: Just because you say ""Just kidding"" or ""LOL"" after your statement doesn't mean you won't get canned for your tweet. Sacco apologized Sunday: ""For being insensitive to this crisis -- which does not discriminate by race, gender or sexual orientation, but which terrifies us all uniformly -- and to the millions of people living with the virus, I am ashamed."" Of course, not every Twitter mistake ends a career. Some just result in embarrassment or an avalanche of mocking tweets. For example, recently the Republican National Committee tweeted: ""Today we remember Rosa Parks' bold stand and her role in ending racism."" The RNC's intent was to commemorate the anniversary of Rosa Parks' refusal to move to the back of a segregated bus in 1955. But instead, the tweet set off a firestorm with people ridiculing the RNC for suggesting that racism had ended in America. Consequently, the RNC was compelled to tweet out a clarification. The paradox of Twitter is that it's really easy to use and it's just as easy to screw up. So in an effort to help people avoid the pitfalls that have caught so many others, here are some tips for you to keep in mind before you press ""send"" on that next tweet. 1. Proofread your tweets . Sounds simple enough, right? But since we all tweet in a hurry, we often send out typos. One of the worst typos was made by White House senior adviser Dan Pfeiffer, who put out a tweet that accidentally included the N-word. (He was trying to tweet the word ""bigger."") Of course, he deleted that tweet and apologized. But a quick proofread would've prevented this. 2. Racist tweets = unemployment . This should be a no-brainer, but then again so should proofreading tweets. 3. Nothing on Twitter stays anonymous forever . Okay, you're not an idiot. You know enough not to badmouth your employer or co-workers on your personal Twitter account. So you create a fake Twitter account. Genius, right?! Well, just ask Jofi Joseph, a former senior National Security Council staffer who did just that. Joseph created an anonymous Twitter account and leveled criticism at co-workers and even his superiors. He was discovered and fired. Honestly, how can a guy who works with the NSC not realize that the NSC could figure out who he was?! 4. You can't really delete tweets . Sure, there's a delete button on Twitter, but once it's out there, simply put: You're screwed. For example, earlier this year the spokesman for Rep. Raul Labrador tweeted out on the congressman's official Twitter account: ""Me likey Broke Girls,"" in reference to the CBS show ""2 Broke Girls."" The spokesman quickly deleted the tweet, but a short time later the congressman deleted the spokesman from his staff. 5. You don't have to be famous to get fired for a tweet . Having a lower-level job and only a few Twitter followers doesn't translate into immunity from being canned for a tweet. That's the lesson a young guy who worked at a food truck in New York City discovered the hard way. In his case, a big group from a local company ordered food but didn't leave a tip. A few minutes later the employee took to his personal Twitter account to mock the people who had stiffed him and mentioned their company by name. How many Twitter followers did he have? About 300. But two days later he was fired for ridiculing customers. 6. Even jokes can get you fired . I'm a comedian, and I've been subjected to numerous attacks for my jokes on Twitter -- usually from people who say they are offended that I mock their conservative icons. That comes with the territory of being a comedian. But there's a line that comedians can cross which will actually get you fired. Comedian Gilbert Gottfried found out exactly where that line was drawn after he tweeted a series of jokes seemingly mocking the victims of the Japanese tsunami in 2011. Gottfried apologized, but that wasn't enough for insurance giant Aflac. He was fired from his gig as the voice of the Aflac duck. 7. Don't confuse sending a direct message with tweeting . This is an easy mistake to make -- just ask former Rep. Anthony Weiner. Direct messages go to one person and are private like an e-mail. Weiner's problem occurred when he intended to send a photo of himself in his underwear via direct message to one woman. Turns out he accidentally sent the photo to everyone on Twitter. The rest is history. 8. If still in doubt about a tweet, try the ""FireMe!"" app . This app will rate your tweet to give you a sense of whether you will be fired for sending it out. While not foolproof, it can be helpful. Hopefully, these eight suggestions will help you better navigate Twitter without losing your job. Of course, there will always be people who get fired for using Twitter inappropriately. But the upside is that without a job, they will have more time to think before they tweet. It's just too bad that they didn't do that earlier. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Dean Obeidallah.","Dean Obeidallah: Unwise tweets have ruined careers, reputations .

"(CNN) -- Robots can be many things -- knowledgeable, dexterous, strong. But can they ever be genuinely laugh-out-loud hilarious? ""If you prick us in our battery pack, do we not bleed alkaline fluid?"" asks Ginger the Robot, haltingly throwing up its arms in its best impression of a real-life comedian. Truth be told, if Ginger were a human it'd be dying on stage. The cute little machine's monotone voice has all the drama of a conveyer belt, while its expression is as vacant as a doll. Comedic timing is hard to master -- particularly when you have no emotions. Luckily for Ginger, sitting beside it is comedy sidekick -- and programmer -- Heather Knight. The living, breathing 31-year-old engineer heads a theater and robotics collective called Marilyn Monrobot. The group runs everything from a Robot Film Festival, to Cyborg Cabaret, and stand-up alongside poor old Ginger. ""I fell in love with the idea that we could collaborate between the arts and robotics,"" explains Knight, originally from Boston and now a doctorate student at Carnegie Mellon's Robotics Institute in Pittsburgh. ""I was looking for a way to do a performance with a robot, and I was like 'hey, what about a comedy routine on stage?' That way you could make jokes and get real-time feedback along the way,"" she says with infectious fast-talking enthusiasm. Funny business . The unlikely partnership between researcher and robot is not without friction -- at one stage Ginger informs us Knight has been ""cheating"" on it. ""I caught her collecting videos of other robots,"" says the knee-high ""Nao"" robot, created by French robotics company Aldebaran, and popularly used as a learning aid in universities. ""I don't feel pain,"" says blank-faced Ginger. ""But still, that does not compute. I confronted her and she claims she needs to do research with other machines to improve my response capabilities."" There's only one way to win Knight back, it seems. And that's through some aptly robotic dance moves. Indeed, Ginger's charm lies in its very ""robot-ness"" -- which has more in common with human comedy than you might think. ""When it talks about its 'perception capabilities still being in development' -- that gets a laugh almost every single time,"" explained Knight, who programs all of Ginger's dialogue and movements herself. ""People love when it goes all super-techy and acts like a real robot. ""One of the things I've learned from interviewing comedians over the years, is that part of what makes a performance compelling is authenticity. If you're going to be a comedian, you need to bring material from yourself."" Intelligent interaction . And like all good comedians, Ginger must read the crowd. In this case, that involves programming the machine to pick up on social cues like clapping and even smiling. ""Things like laughter, applause, these are symbolic things that we all do,"" says Knight. ""So when you're in a theater you can have hundreds of people that are also data points. ""In the past I've given the audience feedback cards that were red on one side and green on the other, so they could explicitly tell the robot through its vision whether something was working or not."" Regardless of Ginger's comedic powers, the adorable bot could one day influence the ""personalities"" of other machines. ""For example, if you had a robot that's delivering juice boxes in a pre-school, then you'd want it to be pretty warm,"" explained Knight. ""But if you have a robot that's a security guard in a garage at night, with some suspicious people hanging around, then being a little intimidating can totally be appropriate."" Sweet science . While other engineers compete to create the most human-like robot ever, Knight says they might be better off making machines that ""we just really like having around."" ""There's all these different relationships we have with technology now -- frustration with our software updates, or bonding with our cars to the point of naming them,"" she said. ""So it can be refreshing to have a piece of technology actually making fun of its self, rather than just inconveniencing us when it's supposed to be improving our lives."" Ginger's unique comedy act isn't just a research project -- it's an important teaching tool, with Knight's Ted talk attracting over 600,000 views online. ""When the robot makes fun of me, it means I can tell you about my research and it's like my own self-deprecation,"" explained the bubbly engineer, and you get the feeling her popularity is not just down to Ginger, but her own charismatic stage presence. ""It's the spoonful of sugar that makes the education go down."" One thing's for sure, science class would have been a whole lot more interesting with these two at the front. ""They call me Ginger the Robot, gosh I love saying that. It makes me feel like some sort of super hero,"" says the miniature machine with a jerky swivel of the head. ""But actually I am just a mediocre robotic comedian."" Boom! Boom! Quiz: 10 female scientists you should know . Twitter Chat: How do we get girls into STEM?

"(CNN) -- His nickname on the football field was ""Der Hammer"" -- apt for a man who is keen to knock down the barriers faced by gay people in sport. Thomas Hitzlsperger, a former Germany international, revealed Wednesday that he is gay, becoming the most high-profile soccer star to do so to date. The 31-year-old, who retired from the game in September, told German newspaper Die Zeit that he wants to further the debate about homosexuality in sports, which has for long been a taboo. ""I'm coming out about my homosexuality because I want to move the discussion about homosexuality among professional sportspeople forwards,"" he said in an extract prior to the publication of a full interview on Thursday. ""It's been a long and difficult process. Only in the last few years have I realized that I preferred living together with a man."" Support was immediately forthcoming from Hitzlsperger's former Germany teammate Lukas Podolski, who plays for English Premier League club Arsenal. He said it was ""a brave and right decision."" German national team coach Joachim Low said in a statement on the German Football Association's website: ""Thomas has made this personal decision for himself, and should be treated with respect from all sides."" That Hitzlsperger's legacy may come to be dominated by his decision to reveal his sexuality shows how divisive the subject remains in football. On the same day, French newspaper Le Parisien reported a documentary to be shown on Canal+ featured Paris-Saint Germain defender Alex expressing his faith-based disapproval of homosexuality. The Brazilian international, who has also played for English Premier League Chelsea, is quoted as saying: ""God created Adam and Eve, not Adam and Yves."" In February last year former United States international Robbie Rogers revealed he was gay on the day he announced his retirement from the game. He subsequently signed a contract with Major League Soccer club Los Angeles Galaxy in May. Swedish footballer Anton Hysen, son of former Liverpool defender Glenn Hysen, came out in 2011 and told CNN last year he had spoken to other gay players who were too scared to do the same. Hitzlsperger said while homosexuality was generally accepted behind the scenes at clubs he played for, there were still uncomfortable moments. ""In England, Italy and Germany being a homosexual is no big thing, at least not in the dressing room,"" he told Die Zeit. ""I was never ashamed of being who I am but it was not always easy to sit on a table with 20 young men and listen to jokes about gays. ""You let them get on with it as long as the jokes are somewhat funny and not too insulting. Being gay is a topic that is 'ignored' in football and not 'a serious topic in the changing room.' ""Fighting spirit, passion and winning mentality are intrinsically linked, that doesn't fit the clichÃ©: 'Gays are soft.' "" Germany national team coach Joachim LÃ¶w also made a statement today, saying that ""Thomas has made this personal decision for himself, and should be treated with respect from all sides"". Hitzlsperger began his 12-year career in football at Germany's leading team Bayern Munich, and won the Bundesliga title during a five-year stint with Stuttgart. He spent four years at English Premier League club Aston Villa, where the club's fans bestowed his nickname ""Der Hammer"" due to his powerful shot. Hitzlsperger also had spells with Everton and West Ham United in England, either side of a season back in Germany with Wolfsburg, and played a handful of games for Lazio in Italy. He represented his country at the 2006 World Cup and played in final of the 2008 European Championships, earning a total of 52 caps over a six-year period.","Former Germany international footballer Thomas Hitzlsperger comes out as gay .

"There is a defined racial divide in America between how whites and non-whites view police and the criminal justice system, according to a CNN / ORC poll released Monday. More than half of white Americans - 57% - think none or almost none of the police in their area are prejudiced against blacks. Just one quarter of non-white Americans feel the same way. The survey, which was mostly conducted before the shooting of NYPD Officers Wenjian Liu and Rafael Ramos in New York over the weekend,  found similar results on perceptions of the justice system as a whole. While 41% of Americans say the criminal justice system treats blacks fairly, far more whites - 50% - see equity. Among non-whites, that figure drops to just 21%. Two-thirds of non-whites said that the criminal justice system favors whites over blacks. Related: Blame piles on NYC mayor for cop shooting . The CNN / ORC survey offers a statistical explanation of the national racial drama that has unfolded in cities over the past several months, with nation-wide protests over the killing by police of an unarmed black man in Ferguson, Missouri and New York. It reignited over the weekend with the revenge-killing of two New York City policemen. Americans see racism in the justice system, but they do think the problem can be fixed; 53% of whites and 50% of non-whites say racism will not always be a problem in the United States.

"North Korea fired a short-range missile into the Sea of Japan on Sunday, according to South Korea's semiofficial news agency Yonhap, citing a South Korean military official. On Saturday, North Korea launched three short-range guided missiles into the sea, also known as the East Sea, off the Korean Peninsula's east coast, Yonhap reported. The missiles on Saturday were fired in a northeasterly direction, away from South Korean waters, the ministry said. South Korea has beefed up monitoring on North Korea and is maintaining a high level of readiness to deal with any risky developments, the ministry added, according to Yonhap. According to the Arms Control Association, a U.S.-based organization, short-range guided missiles are generally classified as those traveling less than 1,000 kilometers (about 620 miles). Tensions in the region have eased since a period last month that included near daily North Korean threats of war. Opinion: What North Korea could learn from Myanmar . U.S. and South Korean officials feared at that time that Kim Jong Un's regime was planning to carry out a test launch of longer-range ballistic missiles, believed to be Musudans. The South Korean government says they have a maximum range of 3,500 kilometers (2,175 miles). Andrew Salmon, a journalist and author based in the South Korean capital, Seoul, said North Korea's reported launch of short-range missiles Saturday should not cause the same degree of concern as the launch of a satellite or medium-range Musudan rocket. ""It's a short-range tactical weapon. If any other country launched this kind of weapon, it's a routine test, nobody would be too worried. It's really simply because it's North Korea doing this that it raises concerns,"" he said. The situation is much less tense in the region than it was last month, Salmon said. ""The North Koreans have significantly de-escalated their bellicosity and their rhetoric since the end of April,"" he said. ""The South Korean government, I suspect, will not be strongly condemnatory of this test because right now they are very, very keen to get the North Koreans to the negotiating table."" Orphaned and homeless: Surviving the streets of North Korea . The recent tensions flared after the North's long-range rocket launch in December and underground nuclear test in February, both of which were widely condemned. Pyongyang's fiery rhetoric intensified in March as the U.N. Security Council voted to tighten sanctions on the regime following the nuclear test. Annual U.S.-South Korean military drills in South Korea also fueled the North's anger, especially when the United States carried out displays of strength that included nuclear-capable B2 stealth bombers. North Korea is demanding recognition as a nuclear power, something the United States refuses to accept. Last month's crisis resulted in the closure of the Kaesong Industrial Complex, the last major symbol of inter-Korean cooperation.

"I'm not mad at Tiger Woods, or Nike. Those people who are up-in-arms that Woods has climbed back to his standing as the world's No. 1 golfer and that he is no longer asking for our forgiveness are hypocrites. ""Winning Takes Care of Everything,"" proclaims his most recent Nike ad, as a focused Tiger crouches in the background. When I first saw the ad, I thought: Wow, bold move by Nike. It's an in-your-face, unapologetic statement. Back in 2009, when Woods took his public plunge into disgrace by cheating on his wife with a long list of silicone-enhanced beauties, we criticized him for being a fake. We said he'd lied not only to his wife but also to his adoring public, who apparently thought he was a near-God. We said he was the role model for our kids. But I never thought it was Tiger's job to teach my son how to be a responsible, loving husband or father. That's a job for parents. Of course, I'm not excusing his behavior, but I am not his judge. His wife and family -- and Tiger himself -- really were the only ones hurt by his actions. Well, now Tiger is being real. He's being honest with the public. We should be happy. He's finally speaking his mind so there can be no question of what type of man he is today. And I say, good for him. Does winning really take care of everything in Woods' life? And good for Nike for standing by him through what was in the end just a personal flaw. It's not like he's Lance Armstrong, who used enhancement drugs throughout his career and sabotaged an entire sport for years. Woods did not have to give back his championships because he cheated his sport, his fans or his sponsors. Don't be mad at Tiger. It was never him we were disappointed in anyway. It was the cheating boyfriend or spouse who broke our hearts and split up our families. Be mad at the problems in your own personal life. Or, be mad at yourself. I know when I've screwed up, if I'm honest, the first person to be upset with is myself. Tiger has nothing to do with my life or relationships. The Nike ad may be offensive to those who don't quite understand sports culture, or work in extremely competitive environments such as sales, or Wall Street, and even politics. But in those worlds, nothing could be truer than ""winning takes care of everything."" In those worlds you are only as good as your last big win. Photos: Redemption through sports . How many times have we said to ourselves at work: ""I can turn my career around with one success on my next project?"" Or, ""One win will make my bosses happy and all will be forgotten?"" How many of us say to our kids who play sports: ""Hang in there. All you need is one game-winning goal and that will change everything. Everyone will forget you haven't scored all season."" Winning does change things. Just think of Super Bowl Champion Ray Lewis, who the NFL calls one of the best men to ever play the game. Or former Ohio State football coach Jim Tressel, who was a king for a decade, surviving numerous scandals until he was forced to resign amid NCAA rules sanctions. Tressel then went on to work for the NFL. Why? Because he knows how to win. Does anyone think Joe Paterno would have lasted so long at Penn State among the allegations of child sex abuse if the football program was down-and-out? No, sadly, it was the winning and the big money that kept Paterno and others safe. Heck, even Newt Gingrich and Bill Clinton reclaimed their status as kingmakers after personal disgraces. We are a forgiving nation. For me, nothing is better than someone who can get back up and succeed after a bloody knockout. Tiger got back up. And I hope this time around he can relax, be himself and enjoy the game.","Nike's new ad about Tiger Woods proclaims ""winning takes care of everything""

"(CNN) -- Look out Liverpool, Mario Balotelli has arrived. As famous for his larger than life demeanor as he is for his goalscoring exploits, the mercurial striker has completed his move from AC Milan to the English Premier League club. He joined on a long-term deal, Liverpool said on its website Monday wit the fee reportedly around $26.5 million. ""I'm very happy,"" Balotelli told the club's official website. ""We've been talking about coming here and now I'm happy to be here. ""Liverpool are one of the best teams here in England and the football is very good here. ""It's a great team with young players, and that's why I came here."" The Italian is well known to English football fans after a turbulent two-and-a-half-year stint with Manchester City, where he helped the team to a first league title in 44 years while also gaining a cult following for his off-field antics. But Balotelli could be just the man Liverpool needs to help spearhead its Premier League and Champions League challenge following the departure of last season's top scorer Luis Suarez to Barcelona. ""Suarez's exit left a hole in the side in terms of his goals but more than that, it also left a hole in terms of Liverpool losing a player idolized by the Kop,"" Jim Boardman, writer for Anfield Road and The Anfield Wrap websites, told CNN. ""Few players are idolized at Anfield to the same kind of level that Suarez enjoyed but Balottelli is in prime position to take that crown. ""There are question marks about his temperament but Liverpool are signing a 24-year-old established Italian international, a different proposition to the teenager Manchester City courted, the youngster Jose Mourinho said was unmanageable. ""Every signing is a risk but at Â£16 million in today's market that risk is far smaller than the ones taken a few transfer windows ago when Liverpool paid Â£35 million for Andy Carroll and Chelsea paid Â£50 million for Fernando Torres. ""Balotelli will bring joy to Anfield, whether it's more from his natural talent as a comedian or a goalscorer remains to be seen, but the chances are it'll be both.""","Mario Balotelli joins Liverpool from AC Milan .

"(CNN)Double Masters champion, seven-time PGA Tour winner... and now part-owner of his local Minor League baseball club. Bubba Watson is branching out. After his first Masters victory in 2012, Watson recalled that his father had always hoped that he would become a baseball player rather than a golfer, and now he has done the next best thing by buying a stake in Florida outfit the Pensacola Blue Wahoos. The Wahoos are based around 20 miles from Bagdad, the small town in which the extrovert golf star grew up. But the 36-year-old -- who last year took batting practice with Wahoos players before their game against the Mobile BayBears -- was quick to stress that majority owners Quint and Rishy Studer wouldn't be letting him live out his dream of playing for the team. In a Wahoos statement announcing the deal, Watson explained: ""You won't see me out there in a uniform. I already asked, and they said I can't do that even if I own part of the team. ""Ever since I went to my first Blue Wahoos game, I have been a big fan. I love the atmosphere. It's such a great place to go with friends and family. ""There's something special about pulling for the hometown team. It's great that Quint and Rishy were willing to let me be a part of it, and I look forward to a long and exciting partnership with them. ""I just hope Quint doesn't get tired of my crazy ideas, because I have been known to have a few."" The Studers said they were delighted that Watson had come on board, with Quint Studer adding: ""Rishy, Bubba and I all view the Wahoos as an investment in improving the quality of life for people. ""Together we will continue to create great experiences for all ages, make lifelong memories for our fans, be a super place to work and now, with Bubba's leadership, we will gain a national and international awareness for the Blue Wahoos and Northwest Florida."" Watson's arrival has already made a mark on the Wahoos' Pensacola Bayfront Stadium -- the bar and restaurant has been renamed Bubba's Sand Trap in his honour, and peckish fans will be able to enjoy a Bubba Dub Grilled Cheese,a sandwich that also includes hash browns. The stadium's capacity of a little over 5,000 fans is regularly filled, and earlier this year the arena was ranked 12th in the top 100 U.S. sports venues and experiences by Stadium Journey magazine.","Bubba Watson confirms he has bought stake in Pensacola Blue Wahoos .

"A federal appeals court on Thursday upheld parts of a Texas abortion law pertaining to hospital privileges for physicians who perform abortions and protocols for abortion-inducing drugs, a decision that drew starkly contrasting reactions on both sides of the debate. A U.S. district court previously struck down those provisions in the Texas law, which were challenged in court by lawyers for Planned Parenthood.  But the 5th Circuit Appeals Court later issued a stay of that decision ""pending appeal,"" meaning it would not go into effect. The U.S. Supreme Court also weighed in, with a majority refusing to stop the law's implementation. In the ruling opinion, Justice Antonin Scalia wrote that an appeals court stay could not be vacated ""unless that court clearly and 'demonstrably' erred in its application of 'accepted standards.'"" Thursday's ruling means the provisions will remain valid in the state of Texas, until or unless the U.S. Supreme Court rules otherwise or legislators in the state act to modify the law. Supporters of such legislation cheered the ruling. Susan B. Anthony List President Marjorie Dannenfelser applauded the judges ""for upholding this commonsense measure to safeguard women."" ""The people of Texas have spoken through their elected leaders and in support of protecting the culture of life in our state,"" said Gov. Rick Perry, a conservative Republican. ""Today's court decision is good news for Texas women and the unborn, and we will continue to fight for the protection of life and women's health in Texas."" Not surprisingly, Planned Parenthood had an opposite reaction, with President Cecile Richards characterizing the decision as ""a terrible court ruling."" ""The latest restrictions in Texas will force women to have abortions later in pregnancy, if they are able to get to a doctor at all,"" Richards said. ""This court ruling is not the last word."" House Bill No. 2 first caught the country's attention thanks to state Sen. Wendy Davis, who is now a Democratic gubernatorial candidate, and her pink tennis shoes. Davis filibustered the bill for 13 hours in June 2013, earning her street cred in progressive circles but failing to stop the bill's passage. The fight then moved to the courts, with Planned Parenthood filing to halt the law just before it was to take effect. Specifically, the group challenged a provision that required any doctor performing or inducing an abortion to have admitting privileges ""at a hospital no more than 30 miles from the location where the abortion is provided."" Among other things, Planned Parenthood argued the requirement ""lacked a rational basis."" Furthermore, the group's lawyers surmised that it would cause women to lose access to abortions because clinics would shut down, in part because hospitals might refuse to give admitting privileges to those who performed abortions elsewhere. The district court found the arguments valid, not buying the state's contention that the hospital privilege provision would help to better ensure patient's safety by certifying an abortion provider's competency and enhancing communication in an emergency in which hospital care is needed. The appeals court reversed the lower court ruling. Not only are similar provisions in effect elsewhere, but the 5th Circuit appeals court also found that it has ""a rational basis"" and ""the plaintiffs offered no evidence implying that the State enacted the admitting privileges provision in order to limit abortions."" Moreover, the court disputed the assertion that ""abortion practitioners will likely be unable to comply,"" noting state and federal laws ""prohibit hospitals from discriminating against physicians who perform abortions when they grant admitting privileges."" Thursday's ruling also overturned the district court decision on another matter: whether abortion-inducing drugs ""must comply with the protocol authorized by the Food and Drug Administration."" As is, some doctors follow an ""off-label protocol"" different from the FDA recommendations. The district court found the relevant provision in the Texas law places ""a substantial obstacle in the path of a woman seeking"" an abortion between 50 and 63 days after her last menstrual period. The appeals court, again, disagreed: ""H.B. 2 on its face does not impose an undue burden on the life and health of a woman, and the district court erred in finding to the contrary.""","Wendy Davis' filibuster raised profile of the Texas abortion law at center of court fight .

Tycoon Erick Thohir is only the second foreign owner in the Italian first division after acquiring a 70% stake in three-time European champions Inter Milan. He has added Inter to what is fast become a comprehensive sporting profile after becoming the first Asian to own a stake in an NBA team as part of a consortium which purchased the Philadelphia 76ers in 2011.

While a new phenomenon in Italy, foreign ownership is more prevalent in the rest of Europe. The English Premier League has 11 foreign-owned clubs, including Americans in charge at Manchester United, Arsenal and Liverpool and Qatari money funding Manchester City's continued growth. Qatar also has interests at the top of the French league, with reigning champions Paris Saint-Germain bankrolled by Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber Al Thani. PSG's rivals Monaco are controlled by Russian billionaire Dmitry Rybolovlev. Sheikh Abdullah bin Nasser bin Abdullah Al Ahmed Al Thani at Malaga is the only foreign owner in Spain's top flight, while there is no overseas ownership in Germany's Bundesliga. However, there will still be an Italian influence in the corridors of power at Inter's San Siro stadium with former president Massimo Moratti staying on as a member of the board. ""I think Inter's history is going to be enriched by a new season thanks to our new international partners who, I am sure, will contribute to a continued string of successes,"" said Moratti, who has seen the team win 23 trophies under his family's stewardship. ""The new partners' enthusiasm and pragmatism are certainly a guarantee for the future."" The takeover reflects Asia's growing influence in world football, particularly in Indonesia.

"The Gulf's three major airlines have spent the week topping up their fleets with record-breaking plane orders. In doing so, they begged the question: who's going to fly all those new planes? ""We estimate that we'll need around 6,000 pilots by 2020, depending on new delivery timings and old aircraft retirement,"" says Nabil Al Boom, a captain and deputy national cadet pilot manager for Emirates Airlines. In fitting with its recent order and general expansion plan, the airline plans to build a suitably large, dedicated flight training academy in the empty desert near the new Al Maktoum airport. Al Boom says he expects it to take 400 cadets each year on a three-and-a-half-year program that is aimed at turning local Emiratis into some of the best pilots in the world. ""It is very rewarding to see someone who you've almost taken off the street in their dish-dash years later with their stripes on their shoulders,"" he says. Emirates isn't the only airline on the lookout.

Though the region can sometimes take a traditionalist stance on women in the workplace, some female pilots have already started paving the way. ""When I told my parents I wanted to be a pilot, oh my, that was a complete 'no-no',"" says 26-year-old Alia Twal, a first officer for Royal Jordanian Airlines. It took a year for Twal to convince her father. Since then, she hasn't looked back. At the age of 21, she became a flight instructor, and now holds the position of governor of the Arabian chapter of The Ninety-Nines, the International Organization of Women Pilots, which, alas, only has 36 members. Not surprisingly, women continue to be underrepresented in the industry, not just in the Middle East, but globally. Women only account for 5% of members of the Air Line Pilots Association -- the trade organization that represents pilots at U.S. and Canadian carriers. According to Twal, there are only 20 female pilots in all of Jordan (paltry, given the country's population boasts 6.3 million). While Twal says attitudes in Jordan are changing for the better, she admits her gender can prove a barrier, especially when she's  charged with training less experienced pilots who are both older, and male.

She's hoping that will change one day. As vice president of the Middle East chapter of Women in Aviation, she's seen a great deal of potential during school visits and at talks. ""We're keen to get more women into the industry, and what we're seeing is very encouraging,"" she says. ""Ultimately it shouldn't matter who is flying the plane."" Twal agrees: ""The plane does not know who is flying her. We are all equal.

"On the second and final day of Jay-Z's Budweiser ""Made in America Festival"" in Philadelphia, conversation remained centered on its host. After bringing out Kanye West and most of his G.O.O.D. Music crew on the first night during his headlining set, the Brooklyn emcee returned on Sunday, joining Pearl Jam for an airtight, riffing take on his Black Album cut ""99 Problems,"" a version of the song only comparable to a 2004 collaboration with Phish. Jay's surprise appearance highlighted what was a momentous set by Eddie Vedder's crew. Over two hours, the rock vets satiated all levels of fans, mixing set staples (""Better Man,"" ""Alive,"" ""Even Flow"") with unexpected gifts, including a full ride through the Vs. cut ""WMA"" and a brief interlude into the Ramones' ""Blitzkrieg Bop"" during the outro of ""Daughter."" A day earlier, Jay-Z screened a PSA from Barack Obama for audience members, urging them to vote in the upcoming election. Almost exactly 24 hours later Vedder also dabbled in political gesture: ""I want to talk about one of the political parties, "" he told the crowd before charging through the Clash's protest anthem ""Know Your Rights."" ""I won't mention any names, but one of the parties wants to make it harder for you to vote.

Drake, wearing a white-on-white jean-and-tank combo, delivered on the unenviable task of warming up the stage for Pearl Jam. The Young Money rapper, who revealed he's ""working on a new one right now,"" linked up with G.O.O.D Music's 2 Chainz for a fierce take on the Atlanta rhyme-slinger's  ""No Lie"" and MMG's day-one absentee French Montana for ""Pop That."" The rapper, who got somber during the singsong plea of ""Marvin's Room,"" balanced it out with humor (""You got a tank top on and your nipples are out,"" he told an audience member). Performing for the first time since the 2002 murder of co-founder Jam Master Jay, seminal hip-hop crew Run-D.M.C. reunited for a triumphant Sunday afternoon set. Surviving members Joseph ""Run"" Simmons and Daryl ""D.M.C."" McDaniels paid tribute early and often to their late partner (""Jam Master Jay was everything to us, so we put a silence on the group,"" Run explained of the group's decade-long hiatus), even having the late DJ's two sons, DJ Mizell and J'Son, behind the decks. Run, decked out in full Adidas regalia, made no secret of his elation over returning to the stage: ""Damn, this feels good,"" he said at the start of a 40-minute set that peaked with ""It's Tricky"" and ""Mary, Mary."" Immediately after Run-D.M.C. left the stage, rap's newest generation of talent was put on display with a set from Odd Future, which featured an abundance of ""Wolf Gang"" chants and six of the collective's rappers, including Tyler, the Creator, Earl Sweatshirt, and Hodgy Beats. Late in the set, Tyler debuted a blistering, as-yet-unfinished song, sarcastically prefacing it with a false disclaimer: ""It's really calm,"" he said. It wasn't, and Odd Future catalyzed the formation of the only mosh pit Rolling Stone saw all weekend. Punk rockers X attracted a thin crowd late Sunday night at the Liberty side stage; today's punks were nowhere to be found, as the band brought in a markedly older demographic. The foursome appeared a little stiff onstage, but aurally speaking, any Eighties cobwebs were thoroughly dusted off as the band nailed classics like ""Los Angeles"" and ""Johnny Hit and Run Paulene."" Earlier in the day, with rain falling intermittently on the crowd, Rita Ora -- Roc Nation's up-and-coming artist (and a finalist for Rolling Stone's Woman Who Rock contest) -- looked like a street Beyoncé (think beanie and bangs) as she wilded out to her forthcoming debut's Biggie-inspired, reggae-tinged single ""How We Do (Party)"" and ""Hot Right Now."" The Hives, wearing their usual top hats and tuxedos, followed Ora's performance with an occasionally comical but always full-throttle showing. ""You got hands, clap them. You got a**es, shake them,"" frontman Pelle Almqvist instructed the crowd before launching into their new cut ""Take Back the Toys."" One of Sunday's biggest draws was Afrojack, whose set spawned a veritable diaspora toward the Freedom Tent after Drake's main stage performance, siphoning off a considerable number of festivalgoers from X's set on the nearby Liberty Stage. The DJ and producer spun crowd-pleasers like his remix of Martin Solveig's ""Hello"" as his smoke machines were on in full force. ""We're going to make it feel like sunshine,"" Philly native Santigold promised after inviting a handful of eager fans onstage for ""Creator."" Fellow Philly singer Jill Scott did her part to keep the mood lively, calling on the city's own Eve for a surprise performance of ""Let Me Blow Ya Mind,"" a song which had the hometown crowd singing along with every word.

"(CNN) -- It has been said that health policy is too important to be left solely to doctors, because the determinants of health lie mainly outside the medical care system. For complementary reasons I would say that economic policy is too important to be left solely to economists. The effects of economic policy are much more than economic, health principally among them. In fact, so close is the link between social and economic policy and health, that health can serve as an evaluator of policy, a kind of social accountant. Arguably, we value health more than we value growth in the gross domestic product. Health as a social accountant is highly relevant to debates about macroeconomic policy in the wake of the global financial crisis. My caricature of what passes for debate on macro-economic policy is that austerians believe that national debt has to be reduced in order to get economic growth. Keynesians believe that you have to get economic growth in order to reduce debt. Therefore, a booming economy, not an ailing one, is the time for government to spend less. As a non-economist, my solution to the debate is to look not at which policy leads more quickly to economic growth, but at the effect of policy on the lives people are able to lead, and thus on their health. Whatever good economic effects the authors of policies of austerity imagine them to have, their effects on the lives of young people in Europe have been disastrous. There is little doubt that policies of austerity have contributed to youth unemployment in large numbers. Recent figures show unemployment rates of 15 to 24-year-olds are 36% in Portugal, more than 41% in Italy, almost 60% in Greece and almost 58% Spain. By contrast, the figure is just over 11% in the Netherlands and under 8% in Germany. Perhaps some of these young people in Southern Europe are in ""informal"" employment, and shouldn't be counted as unemployed. Even so, there is still a major issue of youth unemployment. It is little use politicians lecturing school leavers to stop being layabouts and get a job, if the jobs are not there. Arguably, policies of austerity make job opportunities more scarce. Youth unemployment matters for at least three reasons. First, unemployment is bad for mental and physical health. Looking across Europe, in general the higher the unemployment rate of a country the higher the suicide rate, and the homicide rate. Far from unemployment being a lifestyle choice, people dislike it so much they are more likely to kill themselves, and each other. The short term effects of unemployment are on mental health. In the longer term, physical health is damaged. In the 1980s economic downturn in Britain, there was clear evidence that unemployment was associated with an increase in mortality of about 20%, compared with people in the same occupational class. Second, young people who leave education for the scrap heap are in danger of never getting gainful employment with any security. The implication is a life of social marginality, including social isolation, poverty and homelessness -- all of which are bad for health. Throw into the mix the fact that the unemployed have worse diets, are more likely to smoke, and may suffer from the effects of alcohol and drugs, and you have a potent recipe for ill-health. Third, ill-effects on health are correlated with other unfortunate social consequences. The riots that scarred London in the summer of 2011 began in Tottenham. I had been citing Tottenham as having the worst male life expectancy in London, 18 years shorter than that in affluent Kensington and Chelsea. What a coincidence that the riots should have started in Tottenham, and not in Kensington and Chelsea. Of 1,000 young rioters going through magistrate courts, 91.4% were not in education, employment or training. Why would a young person with a job, or in education, or training, want to riot and loot, when they have a stake in the future? I do not believe in counsels of despair. The problem of youth unemployment and health is soluble. One strategy is to deal with youth unemployment by making it a prime consideration for macro-economic policy. Other things equal, as economists love to say, do not pursue policies that throw young people on the scrapheap. A complementary strategy is to pursue active labor market policies that have the twin strategy of reasonable unemployment benefits and mechanisms to help young people into training or employment. Evidence from across Europe suggests that the greater the investment in active labor market policies the less effect unemployment has on suicide rates. An economic policy to prevent mental illness? As a public health doctor I would recommend it. READ MORE: . CNN Money: The Future of Health Care . Unemployment is hard on the heart, and the harm may add up . Unemployment takes tough mental toll .

"(CNN) -- The summit of the Hahnenkamm looms large over the Austrian ski resort of Kitzbuhel, more than 1,700 meters above sea level. A myriad of ski slopes meander down the mountain in winter, the most famous of which is the notorious ""Streif."" Translated as ""streak,"" it is the ultimate in downhill courses, and the World Cup race it hosts every January is often run in ludicrously treacherous conditions. Watched by celebrities, such as Arnold Schwarzenegger and Europe's jet set, it is often referred to as ""the Super Bowl of skiing."" The winner each year attains virtually legendary status within the skiing community, while its famous sections such as the Mausefalle and Steilhang -- taken at speeds of about 90 mph -- have become bywords in the Austrian lexicon. At the start gate, insignias bearing the names of its most illustrious sons and daughters take pride of place: Franz Klammer, who won the prestigious downhill four times; Fritz Strobl, a three-time winner; and, most recently, Urban Zemmer, a 42-year-old Italian farmer with a Germanic name. Zemmer's wins on the Streif, though, have come in very different fashion -- and indeed a month after the main event -- as he switches skis for spikes and tackles the course uphill rather than down. As maverick events go, Vertical Up is right up there. The night race, now in its fourth year, features multinational competitors from across Europe -- some choosing cross-country skis and poles -- testing their mettle in subzero temperatures. From the chalets in the valley below, it looks like an eerie blur of lights as the runners in their head torches disappear up the slopes at varying degrees of speed. The goal is simple -- the first one to the top wins. That has tended to be Zemmer, who holds the course record of 32 minutes. The climb, parts of which are virtually vertical, is 3,312 meters in distance with an uphill in total of 860m. By day, Zemmer gets up at 6 a.m. to deal with the cattle on his farm. By night it appears he likes nothing more than careering up a mountainside ... at speed. But why exactly? ""Everyone thinks of the Streif in the sense of downhill racing -- the Vertical Up offers an absolutely new possibility of becoming a Streif conqueror with the bottom-up method,"" he tells CNN. ""Plus I'm now honored by an insignia at the top of the next to the great names like Franz Klammer."" So determined is he to exercise when his working day is done -- Zemmer competes in summer mountain races, likes to cycle and run with his dog, and even his holidays are spent traveling to races -- that he admits: ""I have no idea of boredom."" The first event came into being by word of mouth and, continuing in that same vein, it has become more and more popular. A relatively modest crowd gathers at the bottom but, the whole way up it, crowds hug the advertising hoardings. ""You can feel the enthusiasm and that's very motivating to push myself forward and give the best in order to reach the finish in a good time,"" Zemmer says. ""In every race, you get yourself to the limit, sometimes even further. And in the race I am totally by myself. After the start, I can't see or hear anything. I am just totally focused on my aims. ""The victory is just the reward for all the struggle and the acknowledgment for all the deprivation, which you have to accomplish in sport."" The motto for the Streif downhill is that the best form of defense is attack, and it is something Zemmer adheres to, although the rest of the competitors, who vary massively in their standard, are not always so gung-ho. Among them is former cyclist Gerrit Glomser, an ex-Tour de France competitor and a two-time Tour of Austria winner in his heyday. In the Vertical Up, he does not aspire to victory, although he boasts a top-10 finish in his three outings to date. His inspiration to tackle the slopes came from seeing Austrian skiing great Hermann Maier enter the prologue of the 2003 Tour de France, a race in which Glomser also took part. He had thought of being one of the skiers who help prepare the Streif for the World Cup event but, perhaps rightly, he decided it was too dangerous so opted for uphill instead. ""This is a challenge but more than that it's fun with friends,"" says Glomser. ""It's not a goal to win but I want to do my best. It's not like I'll be disappointed in 17th or 39th or whatever. ""This is about good times on a route which downhillers have come down a few weeks before... fast."" But it is not all fun for the competitors. ""When you get to the end, it's just a relief,"" Glomser admits. ""There's a 100-meter vertical climb at one point during which it feels like your chest is up at your throat. It's hard but then you finish, you get a warm drink and it's joy."" For an athlete who has tackled the Tour's toughest cycling ascents, Glomser is more naturally prepared than other entrants. ""Running up hills is quite normal for me,"" adds the 38-year-old. ""It's hard to compare pushing in the pedal with running uphill but it's something that suits me. ""But it's totally different to the Tour. It's not like anything else, running up ice in spikes. It's -10 degrees but a short-sleeve T-shirt could be fine as you get warm really fast."" British competitor Paul Doyle, a 26-year-old with a best Vertical Up time of 46 minutes, has been a resident in Kitzbuhel since 2005, working as a skiing instructor and also to become a fitness trainer. At last year's race, he said his heart rate was an average 190 beats per minute -- the normal resting rate is 60-100. Like Zemmer and Glomser, he has competed in every Vertical Up to date, and admits to slight nerves beforehand. ""It gets steep immediately and there's only a tiny bit of respite the whole way,"" Doyle says. ""At the end, it's like you're trying to run but you just can't, and there's a horrible burning in your legs. It feels like at any second you're going to turn to jelly but then the finish comes. ""Some collapse, some are sick, some are relieved and some are joyous, you feel like you have nothing left. ""I watched Urban's winning race and that's just insane. We all think the downhill guys are nuts, and I guess we're nuts in a different way. This is simply not comparable to anything in the world. It's like a crazy gathering.""

"Cosmetic companies and animal rights groups have welcomed a proposal by China to allow sales of some cosmetics without requiring them to be tested on animals. Animal testing would no longer be mandatory for ""non-specialized cosmetics"", including shampoo, soaps and certain skin products manufactured in China from June next year, according to a document posted on the website of the China Food and Drug Administration earlier this month. Beauty companies have long faced an ugly dilemma in China. Local laws and regulations require animal testing for cosmetic products sold in the country, which has made the lucrative market a tricky area for brands that want to sell in China without alienating consumers in other places that frown upon animal testing. ""Non-specialized cosmetics produced in China could avoid toxicological testing after going through risk and safety checks,"" the China Food and Drug Administration said. Imported cosmetics are not covered in the proposal. But the document indicated that China would gradually ease regulations on animal testing, which would allow more international firms opposed to animal testing to enter China's 134 billion yuan ($22 billion) cosmetics market. Current regulations require all cosmetics to go through a lengthy approval process known as ""toxicological testing"" which involves testing on animals like rabbits and guinea pigs. ""The Body Shop welcomes the signals that the Chinese authorities are adopting a new approach to cosmetic testing,"" spokeswoman Louise Terry said in emailed comments from London. ""We have campaigned against animal testing for over 20 years and we look forward to selling our products in China one day."" Cosmetic brand Urban Decay last year abandoned plans to sell its products in China in response to pressure from consumers and campaign groups, according to Cruelty Free International. Dave Neale, animal welfare director at campaign group Animal Asia, told CNN the planned changes had come quicker than expected given that local campaigns against animal testing have only been going for two years. ""That's a very significant development because it took many years for European Union to allow these products to be sold (without being tested on animals)."" Earlier this year, a complete ban on the sale of cosmetics developed through animal testing took effect in the European Union. But Neale added that this proposal would not mark the end of animal testing in China. ""As far as I'm aware, products can still be tested on animals. It just opens the opportunity for non-animal products to be sold,"" he said.","China considers allowing sale of some cosmetics without requiring them to be tested on animals.

But does not expect wholesale end to animal testing of cosmetics in China ."
"HARO, Spain (CNN) -- A Spanish businessman withdrew a controversial lawsuit Wednesday against the family of a teenage boy he struck and killed while driving a luxury car. Tomas Delgado had filed a suit asking the dead boy's parents to pay him €20,000 ($29,400) on the grounds that the collision that killed their teenage son also damaged his Audi A-8. News of the case sparked outrage in Spain and generated deep sympathy for the parents of 17-year-old Enaitz Iriondo Trinidad. He was riding his bicycle home to a campground when Delgado's car hit and killed him in August 2004. Hundreds of people descended on a courthouse in northern Spain in a show of support for the boy's parents Wednesday. They broke into applause when word came that Delgado had dropped the suit. The businessman had insisted in a recent television interview that he was a victim, too. He was not present for a court hearing Wednesday. His lawyer told the court that Delgado felt that the extensive publicity amounted to a public lynching. Outside the courthouse, the boy's father -- Antonio Iriondo -- told CNN he was content with the decision. Yet he also said his family will explore the possibility of criminal charges against the man. ""This is just the beginning,"" the father said. His son was killed as he cycled back from a nearby village to a campground where his family was vacationing. Iriondo Trinidad's father told CNN he heard the screeching of the car from the campgrounds. The teen was struck from behind and dragged 106 meters (347 feet) along the rural highway, the father said. A traffic report said Delgado was traveling 113 km per hour (70 mph) in an area where the speed limit is 90 km (55 mph). An independent expert hired by Trinidad's family said Delgado was going 173 km per hour (107 mph). Shortly after the collision, a judge dismissed criminal charges against Delgado after concluding that he had committed no criminal infraction, the Spanish newspaper El Pais reported. The teen's mother, Rosa, told the newspaper that the family was given three days to appeal the judge's ruling, but they were too distraught to pursue it. She also told the newspaper that her family's lawyer advised her and her husband not to pursue criminal charges. After the collision, Delgado's insurance company paid the family €33,000 ($48,500). Two years after the wreck, Delgado sued the family for damages to his car and for car rental costs. The boy's mother told CNN before the hearing that she was indignant that the driver would seek damages after killing her son. A local prosecutor told reporters that he would take a second look at the case to see whether authorities can file fresh charges against Delgado. E-mail to a friend .

"(CNN) -- Memories of salvaging and stealing to avoid going hungry are part of the legacy of the Great Depression. Some iReporters say they can't help but look at the current economy and feel the past holds lessons for the present. Pam Van Hylckama Vlieg says her great grandfather tried to steal chickens after being laid off from mining. Donna LeBlanc of Waxia, Louisiana, says she carries no credit to this day as a result of the frugality and self-reliance instilled in her by her family. Her husband keeps the couple's credit card and maintains a zero balance. The Great Depression meant scary times for many households as a period of economic downturn spread throughout the world. Historians trace its start to the ""Black Tuesday"" stock crash on October 29, 1929, and argue that the resulting global desperation set the stage for World War II. LeBlanc said her grandparents were fortunate that they didn't have investments and could grow -- or catch -- their own food during the Depression years. Her grandfather Lester was a ""Cajun cowboy"" often seen wearing a cowboy hat, and her grandmother Ida was a resourceful woman who spent much of the 1930s working as a store clerk. LeBlanc, always told never to keep credit card debt, heard frightful stories from Ida. iReport.com: See a photo of the happy couple together after all these years . ""She remembered vividly the barrels of flour, the bolts of cloth and the hunger in the faces of people as they begged for store credit,"" LeBlanc said. ""The store must have been at least marginally successful, because my grandmother was able to purchase, a piece at a time, a complete six-person setting of Gorham Chantilly silverware for her trousseau, linens and even a Lane cedar chest to house her treasures."" The couple would catch wild hogs, feed them corn for a year and eat them once the wild taste was out of the scavenging animals. They also took advantage of available squirrel meat, a common food in the South at that time. ""It was a uniquely disgusting thing ... to see my grandfather take a stewed, skinned squirrel's head, smack the skull's dome with a heavy silver tablespoon, and dine on the brains,"" LeBlanc said. Years after the Depression, LeBlanc's grandparents were well off once again. Ida became a packrat and couldn't help saving what she could. When the family opened up the old cedar chest after she died, they found a decades-old treasure trove of sewing materials and other keepsakes. iReport.com: ""My dad used to cry when he spoke of that Great Depression"" The Great Depression turned many Americans into packrats who couldn't bear to part with anything of potential value. They couldn't always afford to buy what they needed. Pam van Hylckama Vlieg of Williamsburg, Virginia, says her great grandfather, Glen Surber, resorted to stealing food at times because he had hit rock-bottom. Surber left the family behind in Saltville, Virginia, so he could head out to West Virginia's coal mines. After he got laid off, he found himself trying to steal chickens from a nearby farmer to feed his hungry family. He hid behind a tree to wait for nightfall, but his plan was stymied when he found another person lurking in the shadows. ""Both men took off running and then they realized they each thought the other was the farmer, but they were both there to steal a chicken,"" van Hylckama Vlieg said. ""Needless to say, that was another night of water bread."" iReport.com: Can you imagine having to steal to eat? Digging into her memories, van Hylckama Vlieg says her great grandfather eventually found a work program after the New Deal and was able to rebuild his life. She is confident we haven't hit another Depression and that we've learned enough lessons from the past to avoid letting things get as bad as they were before. ""Poppy always said the world turns and everything that has happened would happen again. I am sure if he were still with us today he would be warning us to start a garden and buy some chickens."" Saving is a habitual behavior for those who have lived through the Great Depression, says Anjanette Sanchez of Globe, Arizona. Her grandmother, Vera Vasquez, had a difficult time with the Great Depression and seemed to be scarred by it long after. ""She spoke of the time with great disgust in her voice as if it was the most awful time of her life,"" Sanchez said. ""She mostly spoke of being hungry and having to wear old boots that didn't fit."" iReport.com: Read about those times when nothing could be wasted . Vasquez continued to save her things and always kept her freezer packed with food -- like frozen cactus to eat with her scrambled eggs -- because she'd lived through harsh times. There was never room for ice cubes. ""I guess to her, food was more valuable than ice,"" Sanchez said. ""Her motto at the table was to eat as much as you want, but not to waste the food. Take all you want, but eat all you take."" Sanchez now passes on the same ideas to her children and reminds them not to be wasteful. iReport.com: Do you have a story about the Great Depression?

"North Korea launched three short-range guided missiles into the sea off the Korean Peninsula's east coast Saturday, South Korea's semi-official news agency Yonhap cited the South Korean Defense Ministry as saying. The ministry said it had detected two launches in the morning, followed by another in the afternoon, Yonhap reported. The missiles were fired in a northeasterly direction, away from South Korean waters, the ministry said. South Korea has beefed up monitoring on North Korea and is maintaining a high-level of readiness to deal with any risky developments, the ministry added, according to Yonhap. According to the Arms Control Association, a U.S.-based organization, short-range guided missiles are generally classified as those traveling less than 1,000 kilometers (about 620 miles.) Tensions in the region have eased in recent days since a fraught period last month that included near daily North Korean threats of war. U.S. and South Korean officials feared at that time that Kim Jong Un's regime was planning to carry out a test launch of longer-range ballistic missiles, believed to be Musudans. The South Korean government says they have a maximum range of 3,500 kilometers (2,175 miles). Andrew Salmon, a journalist and author based in the South Korean capital, Seoul, said North Korea's reported launch of short-range missiles Saturday should not cause the same degree of concern as the launch of a satellite or medium-range Musudan rocket. ""It's a short-range tactical weapon. If any other country launched this kind of weapon, it's a routine test, nobody would be too worried. It's really simply because it's North Korea doing this that it raises concerns,"" he said. The situation is much less tense in the region than it was last month, Salmon said. ""The North Koreans have significantly de-escalated their bellicosity and their rhetoric since the end of April,"" he said. ""The South Korean government, I suspect, will not be strongly condemnatory of this test because right now they are very, very keen to get the North Koreans to the negotiating table."" The recent tensions flared after the North's long-range rocket launch in December and underground nuclear test in February, both of which were widely condemned. Pyongyang's fiery rhetoric intensified in March as the U.N. Security Council voted to tighten sanctions on the regime following the nuclear test. Annual U.S.-South Korean military drills in South Korea also fueled the North's anger, especially when the United States carried out displays of strength that included nuclear-capable B2 stealth bombers. North Korea is demanding recognition as a nuclear power, something the United States refuses to countenance. Last month's crisis resulted in the closure of the Kaesong Industrial Complex, the last major symbol of inter-Korean cooperation.","Report: The missiles were fired away from South Korean waters .

"(CNN) -- Danish police made around 250 arrests in Copenhagen Wednesday morning as an organized demonstration against the U.N. climate talks converged on the Bella Center ahead of crucial negotiations at the COP15 summit. Kristina Larsen, a spokeswoman for Climate Justice Action (CJA) -- the group organizing the protest -- told CNN that police have used pepper spray and dogs to contain the protests. Around 3,000 activists convened at two railway stations in the Danish capital early on Wednesday and began their march towards the Bella Center -- the scene of the climate talks. CJA is calling for activists to ""take over the conference for one day and transform it into a 'People's Assembly'."" At the same time protesters were marching towards the U.N. summit, a number of delegates were planning to walk out of the Bella Center. Larsen told CNN: ""Around 300 people have marched out of the Bella Center shouting 'reclaim power'."" But the planned ""People's Assembly"" which was due to take place outside the building has, so far, been disrupted by the police. Reporting from inside the Bella Center CNN's Phil Black said that several hundred activists were near the perimeter of the conference center. ""There have been some clashes and scuffles, and the police have fired some tear gas, but the protests have been reasonably low-level."" Black said. CJA say they are holding a ""People's Assembly"" to counter the ""false solutions and elitism of the U.N. climate talks."" A spokesman for the Copenhagen police told CNN that the majority of arrests have taken place outside the Bella Center but there have been no serious injuries. ""The protesters detained have been taken to a temporary holding facility and most are expected to be released in the next two hours,"" the Police spokesman said. On Sunday, police said they had detained 968 people, accusing protesters of donning facemasks, throwing fireworks and stones, breaking windows and setting vehicles alight. A further 212 people were arrested overnight on Monday. CJA says that protesters are engaged in ""peaceful, nonviolent protest"" and accused the police of being ""out of control."" ""We've had a lot of police repression in the last couple of days,"" Larsen told CNN. She also claimed that the environmental group Friends of the Earth had been denied access to the Bella Center on Wednesday morning. While the protests were going on outside, inside it was being announced that Danish minister Connie Hedegaard had resigned as president of the U.N. climate change summit. ""The resignation is essentially procedural,"" CNN's Phil Black said, ""and she'll be replaced by the Danish prime minister. It's a reflection of the fact that the talks are now at the high-level phase, and it was deemed appropriate that the PM should now take over."" World leaders have started arriving in Copenhagen for the final days of ""high-level"" negotiations. British Prime Minister Gordon Brown was among the first to arrive, holding talks Tuesday with Australian and Bangladeshi counterparts Kevin Rudd and Sheikh Hasina. U.S. President Barack Obama is expected to arrive Friday. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon told nations Tuesday that they had the chance to ""change the course of our history"" if they worked together to limit carbon emissions that are blamed for increasing global temperatures. ""We have a chance -- a real chance, here and now -- to change the course of our history,"" he said, noting that countries had to work quickly, because nature doesn't negotiate. He urged both industrialized and developing countries to do more during this week's Copenhagen summit toward reaching an agreement on limiting the emissions, saying they ""can and they must do more."" ""This is a time to stop pointing fingers,"" Ban added. ""This is a time to start looking in the mirror and offering what they can do more of."" Are you in Copenhagen? Share your images . U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton wrote Tuesday that the United States is ready to do their part to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions but that other countries, especially poorer ones, must play their parts as well. Clinton's assertion came as a major international summit headed into the home stretch. ""Nearly all of the growth in emissions in the next 20 years will come from the developing world,"" Clinton wrote in an opinion piece for the International Herald Tribune. ""Without their participation and commitment, a solution is impossible."" The divide between rich and poor countries is one of the key fissures at the conference. Developing countries object to restrictions that they fear would keep them from following the same path to prosperity taken by the United States and other industrialized nations. The man running the conference warned Tuesday that ""nowhere near enough progress"" had been made toward an agreement. ""There is still an enormous amount of work and ground to be covered if this conference is to deliver what people around the world expect it to deliver,"" Yvo de Boer, executive secretary of the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change, said at a news conference.","Protesters to hold day of action at climate change summit in Copenhagen .

"(CNN) -- This week in iReport, we're looking at one of the hottest topics of discussion lately: President Obama's decision to send more troops into Afghanistan. iReporters had a lot to say about this issue, but that's not all. iReporters showed us long lines all around the U.S. for Black Friday, and one shared the story of survivors still suffering 25 years after a major industrial accident in India. Finally, a giant condom was unfurled in observance of World AIDS Day. Obama's Afghanistan plan -- iReporters certainly weren't at a loss for words when it came to President Obama's recent decision to send 30,000 more troops into Afghanistan. Some believed that he was right in listening to his generals and doing exactly that. Others said that it was time for the troops to come home. No matter how iReporters felt about the issue, it was certainly a spirited debate. Chemical disaster -- We looked at powerful international stories this week. One video commemorated the 25th anniversary of a chemical gas disaster in Bhopal, India. On December 3, 1984, 40 tons of poisonous chemicals escaped a Union Carbide chemical plant. iReporter Joel Gershon told us people are still suffering health problems from the tragedy, and he interviewed people who remember the accident and are feeling its effects. World AIDS Day -- We also saw something a bit offbeat, but with a serious message. Gert Ungerer shared the story of a giant canvas ""condom"" placed over a lighthouse on the northern coast of South Africa to bring awareness of World AIDS Day. The region has felt the serious effects of AIDS. Ungerer's video outlined how the condom structure was put up and how it looks in daylight.

"It was a bloody Father's Day weekend in Chicago, but police said murder and shooting rates are significantly below those at the same time last year. Seven people were shot to death and there were 26 ""shooting incidents"" from Friday to Sunday, according to Chicago Police Department spokesman Adam Collins. But to put it into perspective, Collins said, eight more people were shot on the same weekend last year. He said overall crime in Chicago is down 14%, the lowest since 1963. Opinion: Chicago's violence took my dad, friends . Chicago Police Superintendent Garry McCarthy issued a statement regarding the weekend's violence, saying that ""while we've had fewer murders to date this year than any year since the mid-1960s, there's more work to be done and whether it's police, clergy, community organizations, parents or residents, we all have a role to play in continuing to reduce violence and no one will rest until everyone in Chicago enjoys the same sense of safety."" The city ended 2012 with a marked increase in homicides, with 506 people killed that year, up from 433 in 2011. Forty-three people were killed in January 2013 alone. Hadiya Pendleton, 15, was one of those January victims. The teenager had just performed at one of the events surrounding President Barack Obama's inauguration in Washington when she was shot dead in a park a mile from his Chicago home. First lady Michelle Obama attended Pendleton's funeral, and her story became part of the national gun-control debate. Two men have been charged in Pendleton's death. In a February speech about gun violence, President Obama said that poverty and violence are connected and that parents and communities must work to provide hope for young people. Study: Gun homicides, violence down sharply in past 20 years . ""In too many neighborhoods today, whether here in Chicago or the farthest reaches of rural America, it can feel like, for a lot of young people, the future only extends to the next street corner or the outskirts of town,"" he said at a Chicago high school. ""This is not just a gun issue,"" he continued. ""It's also an issue of the kinds of communities that we're building, and for that we all share responsibility as citizens to fix it."" The March shooting death of a 6-month-old baby also captured national headlines. Jonylah Watkins was killed while her father, Jonathan, was changing her diaper in a minivan, police said. A man has been charged in the shooting, which prosecutors say stemmed from the theft of a video game. Chicago's police department has been implementing a new plan to fight crime, and ""we've come up with what I think is a groundbreaking way to do it,"" McCarthy told CNN. Nurses dodge bullets to provide care . The plan centers around drug operations, a new gang database system and more beat cops on the street. ""The same cops on the same street every day, and they know the kids who are coming from basketball practice and the kids that are standing on the street corner,"" McCarthy said. But the city has used more than 75% of its overtime budget, and despite the success, not everyone agrees this is the best way forward. Opinion: Treat Chicago gangs as terrorists . U.S. Sen. Mark Kirk of Illinois announced a plan last month to arrest thousands of gang members -- a plan that was called a ""white boy solution"" by U.S. Rep. Bobby Rush of Chicago. Rush favors community development programs over heavy-handed justice. ""Both are necessary, not either-or, and the notion that its one or the other is wrong,"" said Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanueal. 2 charged in Chicago teenage girl's killing plead not guilty . Emanuel helped develop the overall crime strategy, which, along with the policing changes, includes pushing parents to step up, prevention programs and justice. He says despite the success there are still some serious issues that need to be tackled. ""We still have a challenge where people know someone has committed a crime and are not reporting it,"" he said. ""The community has to be part of the solution to have it long term not momentary, to have it really ingrained to make a community safe.""

"Tehran, Iran (CNN) -- A magnitude 5.3 earthquake hit southern Iran on Saturday morning, the U.S. Geological Survey said, a day after another moderate quake in the country's northeast left 170 people injured. There were no immediate reports of damage or injuries from Saturday's earthquake that struck about 60 miles (95 kilometers) south of Kerman, the USGS said. Friday's magnitude 5.6 earthquake rocked the northern agricultural city of Torbat-e Heydarieh for about 10 seconds, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported. Three villages in the city and 10 others nearby were damaged, and 170 people were injured, IRNA said. Ten people were hospitalized, IRNA said. There was concern Saturday because the Torbat-e Heydarieh quake has produced no aftershocks. Mahmoud Mozaffar, the head of the Red Crescent Society's Rescue Division, told IRNA that could mean a larger earthquake is imminent. The Red Crescent set up 300 tents in Torbat-e Heydarieh to house those whose homes were damaged or destroyed. Iran lies on a series of seismic fault lines and experiences earthquakes almost daily. At times they have devasting consequences, most notably in December 2003, when a 6.6-magnitude quake devastated the ancient city of Bam in southeast Iran and killed at least 30,000 people. Last year, an earthquake struck Hormozgan province in southern Iran, injuring about 700 people in the port city of Bandar Abbas, state media reported. In 2008, a 6.1-magnitude earthquake struck in Hormozgan, demolishing nearly 200 villages and killing at least six people.","Magnitude 5.3 earthquake hits southern Iran on Saturday .

"President Barack Obama delivered one of the most crucial addresses of his presidency, seeking to convince an overwhelmingly skeptical public of the need to punish Syria militarily for alleged chemical weapons use while demonstrating a commitment to pursuing a surprise diplomatic opening to remove those stockpiles from the war-torn nation. With many in Washington and on Main Street demanding clarity during fast-moving events, Obama had five questions to answer Tuesday night: Did he do it? 1. With diplomacy in play, why is military action necessary? This was the most important question the president needed to tackle in his 15-minute, prime-time address. In a major development, Syria has reportedly accepted a Russian proposal to hand over its chemical weapons stockpile to international control, but the details of what was actually agreed to are still murky. The White House is skeptical, cautioning that it could be a stall tactic. But it said it would take a hard look, and it pledged to work with international partners to see what can be achieved. Obama is dispatching Secretary of State John Kerry to Geneva, Switzerland, on Thursday to meet with his Russian counterpart to see where the initiative may go. A stunning turn that could silence Syria war drums . Obama spent most of the speech laying out a chronology of events and pushing for military action on moral, political and strategic grounds, saying that previous efforts to resolve the Syrian conflict diplomatically had failed. He painted a graphic picture of an August 21 attack that his administration says was carried out by the regime of Bashar al-Assad and killed more than 1,400 people. ""The images from this massacre are sickening: Men, women, children lying in rows, killed by poison gas. Others foaming at the mouth, gasping for breath. A father clutching his dead children, imploring them to get up and walk. On that terrible night, the world saw in gruesome detail the terrible nature of chemical weapons, and why the overwhelming majority of humanity has declared them off limits -- a crime against humanity and a violation of the laws of war,"" he said. He only brought up the Russian development later in the address, calling the offer an encouraging sign. But he warned that ""it's too early to tell whether this offer will succeed, and any agreement must verify that the Assad regime keeps its commitments."" He left open the possibility of diplomacy falling short, saying that he has ordered the military to maintain its posture in the region ""to keep the pressure on Assad."" And he wrapped up by arguing that America must lead and that force was just in this case. ""America is not the world's policeman. Terrible things happen across the globe, and it is beyond our means to right every wrong. But when, with modest effort and risk, we can stop children from being gassed to death, and thereby make our own children safer over the long run, I believe we should act. That's what makes America different. That's what makes us exceptional,"" he said. He did, however, put on hold the domestic effort intended to approve a military strike. He asked Congress hold off on voting on the issue -- a vote he probably did not have majority support for. Commentators said after the speech that most Americans probably understand the moral case, but they questioned whether Obama could ultimately sway public opinion to see things his way. A CNN/IRC International initial poll of viewers of the speech found that 47% said Obama made a convincing case for action, compared with 50% who said he did not. U.S. Rep. Elijah Cummings, a Maryland Democrat and staunch Obama supporter who is undecided about the Syria issue, praised him for ""a very good job"" but said his position remained unchanged. ""It was not a wasted speech,"" said Cummings, noting that his constituents are tired of war. ""I thought he made a great moral argument."" Share your view of the speech . 2. Why should Americans worry about Syria? Obama stressed again that the use of sarin gas in Syria was a moral abomination that Americans and the international community simply cannot tolerate. But, simply put, Americans are sick of war. In a CNN/ORC poll released Monday, six in 10 say the Iraq war was a mistake, and about half say the same thing about Afghanistan. Three-quarters say the United States is not the world's policeman. Additionally, nearly seven in 10 say that it's not in the U.S. national interest to get involved in Syria's civil war. Moreover, 72%, say a U.S. airstrike would not achieve significant American goals. Still, Obama laid out a strategic rationale for military force, saying that what happens in Syria could affect allies in the region, including Israel -- all in the U.S. interest, he said. Inaction, he said, would leave al-Assad ""with no reason to stop using chemical weapons."" And as the global ban against them erodes, ""other tyrants"" could acquire them and use them, as well against civilians and even American troops. ""If fighting spills beyond Syria's borders, these weapons could threaten allies like Turkey, Jordan and Israel. And a failure to stand against the use of chemical weapons would weaken prohibitions against other weapons of mass destruction, and embolden Assad's ally, Iran, which must decide whether to ignore international law by building a nuclear weapon or to take a more peaceful path,"" Obama said. CNN Poll: Part of Syria strike opposition is the messenger's fault . Bruce Riedel, director of the Intelligence Project at the Brookings Institution, said an indirect connection to Americans' security is a difficult case to make, ""and the president is not making it."" ""I don't think he can make a case, because I don't think he knows what to do,"" Riedel added. 3. What would be the endgame? Obama explained the goal of military strikes. He has said the United States does not want to use the strike to take out al-Assad, institute regime change or even aid the rebels in the civil war. ""The purpose of this strike would be to deter Assad from using chemical weapons, to degrade his regime's ability to use them and to make clear to the world that we will not tolerate their use,"" Obama said. Obama did say the United States could not ""resolve someone else's civil war through force,"" and he said he would not send in American troops or pursue an open-ended war like those in Iraq or Afghanistan. ""I will not pursue a prolonged air campaign like Libya or Kosovo. This would be a targeted strike to achieve a clear objective,"" he said. ""Even a limited strike will send a message to Assad that no other nation can deliver,"" he said. ""A targeted strike can make Assad, or any other dictator, think twice before using chemical weapons."" He said that ""the day after any military action, we would redouble our efforts to achieve a political solution that strengthens those who reject the forces of tyranny and extremism."" Sen. Rand Paul, a Kentucky Republican and a member of the Foreign Relations Committee, told CNN after the speech that Obama did not provide a clear military objective for attacking Syria. He said bombing the regime will not truly hold al-Assad accountable and ""will create instability in the Middle East"" that would leave an opening for extremist elements in Syria allied with al Qaeda. U.S. Rep. David Valadao, R-California, agreed with Paul. ""The president has failed to deliver some sort of plan that tells the American people that we can do this and this is what we are trying to accomplish,"" he told CNN. U.S. Senate: How they'll vote on Syria strike . 4. If the U.S. attacks, what if al-Assad retaliates? This is a major risk that concerns many members of Congress. If the U.S. military attack is extremely limited and al-Assad retaliates, what are the contingency plans? Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, asked that critical question: ""What if we execute this strike and then he decides to use chemical weapons again. Do we strike again?"" She said it's one of her biggest concerns. Obama did not address the contingency scenario directly, other than to say that not responding would carry unacceptable risks. ""If we fail to act, the Assad regime will see no reason to stop using chemical weapons,"" he said, adding that continued use could make it easier for terrorists to get their hands on them. Al-Assad has said he would respond. ""You should expect everything,"" he told PBS and CBS interviewer Charlie Rose. Obama said the United States does not dismiss threats. ""But the Assad regime does not have the ability to seriously threaten our military. Any other retaliation they might seek is in line with threats that we face every day.  Neither Assad nor his allies have any interest in escalation that would lead to his demise,"" Obama said. 5. Now that Syria welcomes diplomacy, why did Obama address the public? Obama told CNN's Wolf Blitzer this week that he isn't convinced that Syria is telling the truth. The administration distrusts Syria and its ally Russia, and it worries that the proposal to hand over its chemical weapons stockpile is simply a tactic to buy time and derail a potential U.S. strike. While the administration indicated that it will look into Syria's offer, the president doesn't want to get burned. So he continued to press his case for a military strike. And if Syria's offer proves empty, the president won't have lost any time waiting on the sidelines. Obama told the nation from the start: ""I want to talk to you about Syria -- why it matters and where we go from here."" Riedel said the speech put the president in a difficult situation. ""He was trying to convince people of a war they don't want, but he's also saying wait,"" Riedel noted. Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, a co-host of CNN's ""Crossfire,"" said Obama was misguided in going on national television with the situation so fluid and having told Congress to hold off on considering a force resolution to give diplomacy a chance. Rep. Valadao said the president's speech did nothing to convince him to support a possible military strike. He said that after attending every possible briefing and listening to the speech, ""It's locked me more into a solid 'no' than anything.""","Obama addressed the nation from the White House on Tuesday night .

"You are the one hitting the shots, but the man standing over your shoulder could hold the key to your golfing destiny. A caddie can often be dismissed as just an accessory whose sole role is to lump a golfer's clubs round the course and occasionally throw a few speculative blades of grass into the wind. But new research by a leading university suggests a caddie could prove the difference between success and failure. So when the world's best golfers line up for 2014's final major at the U.S. PGA Championship, take a moment to study the person by their side. ""It's simple. In 2007 my caddie Ronan Flood won me the British Open,"" said three-time major champion Padraig Harrington. The Irishman, who won the U.S. PGA Championship in 2008, had a one-shot lead coming down the 18th at Carnoustie in Scotland as he battled to claim his first major back in 2007. But then the nerves took over. ""I hit my tee shot in the water on 18 and was despondent, I then hit my third shot into the water again and felt like I'd lost,"" he explained. ""I had to walk about 150 yards for my next shot and Ronan was talking to me, coming out with all the cliches about what to do next. ""For the first 50 yards I wanted to strangle him, for the next 50 yards I started listening to him and for the last 50 yards I believed him. ""I was in the zone, then out of it and then back in it again -- that really doesn't happen very often. ""In that moment of time I do believe Ronan made the difference -- with any other caddie I would have thought I had lost but my caddie believed in me. ""It's all about creating your own reality when you're on the golf course."" Harrington's recovery from that double blow secured a playoff with Sergio Garcia that he would go on to win, and the 42-year-old retained his British Open crown the following year. His relationship with Flood was critical in that glut of success, underlined by a pair of YouTube videos to support the study in which Harrington's caddie helped him hole a shot from 150 yards while blindfolded. That was part of the research commissioned by HSBC and carried out by Loughborough University, which says a good caddie can boost a golfer's performance by 30% or more. According to Dr Sophia Jowett, the Director of Research Degrees at Loughborough, the axis between player and caddie must be built around four central pillars. First is closeness, including trust and respect, commitment, being complementary as well as open and co-orientation, which hinges on shared knowledge and understanding. Those qualities are, of course, allied to the nuts and bolts of the job. Any caddie must know the game and their employer inside out, study the course and the wind conditions, have food and water available, as well as be able to tell the odd joke here and there. But fundamentally, according to the top players, you just need someone you get on with. Blog: Rory McIlroy fulfills his destiny . ""We're like brothers, brothers that Mom and Dad left alone -- and they left him in charge,"" Ted Scott previously told CNN of his relationship with two-time Masters champion Bubba Watson. ""Sometimes I just want to punch him, but I love him. And I know he feels the same about me. But don't let anybody else say anything bad about us. We'll go into battle for each other."" Watson notoriously wears his heart on his sleeve while out on the course, and his maverick approach to the game often sees him attempt shots other pros wouldn't even contemplate. A case in point is the shot that set up his first Masters victory in 2012, as he somehow managed to maneuver the ball onto the green from a position deep in the trees of Augusta's 10th hole during a playoff with Louis Oosthuizen. So how does Scott keep Watson's emotions in check? ""It takes a long time to learn someone. And that's the art of caddieing -- you have to learn your player,"" Scott says. ""For Bubba it's about keeping him in the middle emotionally. ""You don't want him to get too excited, or too mad. He's extremely emotional. It's about trying to watch him and getting back to that middle point where he plays his best."" One of the most potent player-caddie relationships of recent times was between Tiger Woods and Steve Williams. The Kiwi was on the bag for all but one of Woods' 14 major titles, and the 38-year-old hasn't claimed another since they parted ways. Williams is now right hand man for Australian Adam Scott, who grabbed his first major title at The Masters in 2013, fulfilling years of potential. ""If caddies are just carrying the bag, then players would just hire a local caddie,"" Williams told the PGA Tour. ""Every player requires different things -- the most important role is basically getting your man around the course best you can. ""You have to have the best understanding of the course all the time so you can try to prevent errors. ""There are always going to be errors, but caddies can give the right information and prevent a lot of errors. But we all know the player hits the shots."" The ultimate pressure might be on the player, but there are a few examples of a caddie only adding to their stress levels. Miles Byrne was caddying for 1991 Masters champion Ian Woosnam at the British Open in 2001 when he realized he had 15 clubs in the bag rather than the permitted 14. Woosnam, who was in contention for the title at the time and eventually finished third, hurled the offending club into the rough when Byrne informed him of the error and sacked him a few weeks later. Thankfully, there were no such dramas this time round. Playing in his first major championship during this year's tournament at Royal Liverpool was home favorite John Singleton. The factory resin worker thought his chances of a pro career had vanished after injury curtailed his progress as a youngster but took his place at Hoylake through a qualifying tournament -- a victory he put down in large part to assistance from his caddy Ally Haddow. ""He's the reason I was at The Open. He did a top notch job when I qualified,"" Singleton told CNN, prior to teeing off at Hoylake. ""He knows it's an emotional week for me, he's fantastic at controlling my emotions -- that's his main job. ""If I hit a bad shot it is my responsibility because I'm the one who hit it. If we're not sure what shot to hit we talk it out until we are happy with it. That builds trust really quickly.""","New research claims a caddie can help boost a golfer's performance by 30% or more .

"One day last January, Robert Ethan Saylor, a 26-year-old man with Down syndrome, went to see the movie ""Zero Dark Thirty.""  When it was over, Saylor briefly left the theater, then decided to return and see it again. The manager called security because Saylor didn't pay, and three off-duty deputies, moonlighting at the mall, came in to confront him. According to Frederick County, Maryland, police statements, he swore at them and refused to leave. The deputies tried to remove him, despite Saylor's caretaker's warnings and pleas for them to wait and let her take care of it. What happened next is a little unclear, but witnesses say the deputies put Saylor on the floor, held him down and handcuffed him. Saylor, called Ethan by his family, suffered a fracture in his throat cartilage. He died of asphyxiation. The death was ruled a homicide, but a grand jury failed to indict the deputies and they returned to work without charges. My son has Down syndrome, so I have been following this case closely. But for months, it seemed as if only people in the disability community cared about it. Petitions for independent investigations sputtered out with just a few hundred votes. Local reporting on the case never made a splash in national media. Meanwhile, the Frederick County sheriff investigated his men's conduct, ruled they had followed procedure correctly, and tried to move on. Police violence against people with disabilities is not uncommon, but the cases don't seem to get a lot of publicity. Most people see the disabled as, at best, passive victims, objects to care for, perhaps to love, but not people with whom we automatically identify. This is a mistake. We are all only temporarily able-bodied.  Accidents, illness, and age wait for us all. What happened to Ethan Saylor could happen to you. In July, his death began to get more attention. Heather Mizeur, a member of the Maryland House of Representatives and candidate for governor, seized on Saylor's story and called for new training for law enforcement. Debra Alfarone, an investigative journalist in Washington, began to broadcast and write about the case.  A petition asking Gov.  Martin O'Malley to investigate went viral in mid-August, garnering 300,000 signatures in just a week. This petition fueled a renewed, suddenly national, media narrative. Ethan Saylor and #JusticeForEthan are now an official cause. What's next? An outside investigation either by the Justice Department or as part of a civil lawsuit might piece together the chain of events from the moment deputies confronted Saylor to his death on the cinema floor. We need an unbiased assessment of responsibility, not just to help the Saylor family understand -- although that's important -- but to help all of us understand what went wrong. When law enforcement officers encounter people with disabilities, things can go wrong very easily. Dennis Debbaudt trains police on how to respond to people with intellectual disabilities, and argues that such cases require special tactics. First, he says, law enforcement officers should ensure that they, bystanders and the person with a disability are all out of danger. If the situation is safe, Debbaudt says, officers need to take all the time that's necessary to resolve the problem without force. He tells officers that if the person with a disability isn't ""aggressing into the officer's space,"" then there's generally no good reason to ""aggress into theirs."" Saylor's aide was asking the officers to wait, rather than handcuff and arrest him, because he hated to be touched. To wait sounds a lot like common sense. According to both the officers' and witnesses' statements, no one seems to have been in danger, a deputy initiated contact only after Saylor swore at them, and witnesses report that the officers remained calm throughout. At worst, taking more time would have inconvenienced other moviegoers -- who, in any event, did not see their movie because of the death. I can't say whether the deputies did anything wrong; in fact, they may have followed their typical procedures to the letter. But with just a little more patience, Ethan Saylor could still be alive. This tragedy raises questions about how people with disabilities fit into society. The Americans with Disabilities Act suggests that employers must offer reasonable accommodations to workers with disabilities. That standard has entered the broader culture, even as we repeatedly litigate the meaning of ""reasonable."" Would it have been reasonable to let Saylor watch the movie for free? Would it have been reasonable to try to talk it out for 10 minutes, 30 minutes, an hour, delaying the start of a movie? Would it be reasonable to bar admission to people with disabilities? Making sure we figure out how to safely include people with disabilities throughout our community matters to everyone. Here's a very different story with an equally tragic ending. On August 2, John Wrana, a 95-year-old World War II veteran in Park Forest, Illinois, was scared. He didn't want to go to the hospital for surgery, because he didn't want to end up on life support. The staff at his assisted living community decided to involuntarily commit him and called the police. He threatened the staff with a shoehorn and a cane. The police came. They shot him with a Taser and and fired beanbag rounds at him. He died.

"(CNN) -- A 20-year-old man died Sunday after being shot with a Taser device during a scuffle with a sheriff's deputy in Maryland, a spokeswoman for the Frederick County Sheriff's Office said. Amnesty International blames dozens of deaths on police use of stun guns. Cpl. Jennifer Bailey said deputies responding to a report of a fight in progress arrived at the location in Frederick, Maryland, just before 5 a.m. ET and found four people fighting. A deputy used a Taser device on one of the men, who fell unconscious, Bailey said. The man was taken to Frederick Memorial Hospital, where he was pronounced dead. His identity was not immediately released, pending the notification of his family. The deputy, who has not been identified publicly, has been placed on administrative leave with pay pending the completion of an investigation, Bailey said. Amnesty International has reported that, since June 2001, more than 150 people have died in the United States after being subdued with a stun gun. The organization has called for police departments to suspend use of the devices pending study of their possible risks. Few have done so, said Amnesty, which added that more than 7,000 of the nation's 18,000 law enforcement agencies use the devices. Last month, a police officer in Vancouver International Airport in Canada used a Taser device on a distraught 40-year-old man on his first airplane trip outside Poland. He died. In a statement released Friday, Taser International cited the Vancouver case and said it ""appears to follow the pattern of many in-custody deaths or deaths following a confrontation with police. Historically, medical science and forensic analysis has shown that these deaths are attributable to other factors and not the low-energy electrical discharge of the Taser."" A bystander's video of the Vancouver incident that showed the victim continuing to struggle after being shot with the device ""is proof that the Taser device was not the cause of his death,"" the company said on its Web site. Cardiac arrest caused by electrical current would have caused immediate death, it said. In addition, ""the video clearly shows symptoms of excited delirium, a potentially fatal condition marked by symptoms of exhaustion and mania such as heavy breathing, profuse sweating, confusion, disorientation and violence toward inanimate objects,"" the company said. ""We are taken aback by the number of media outlets that have irresponsibly published conclusive headlines blaming the Taser device and/or the law enforcement officers involved as the cause of death before completion of the investigation,"" said Tom Smith, the company's founder and chairman of the board. But Amnesty International, noting that coroners have identified Tasers as a contributory factor in more than 30 deaths, said such a link cannot be ruled out. The devices use compressed nitrogen to shoot two probes -- connected to the device by wire -- up to 35 feet away at speeds exceeding 100 mph. An electrical signal transmitted through the wires contacts the body or clothing, ""resulting in an immediate loss of the person's neuromuscular control and the ability to perform coordinated action for the duration of the impulse,"" according to the company.

"BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN) -- Six car bombings in four hours killed 48 people and wounded 81 in various Baghdad neighborhoods Wednesday, according to Iraq's Interior Ministry. Iraqi soldiers survey one of the Baghdad marketplaces where car bombs detonated Wednesday. In a separate incident, five people were killed and three wounded by a roadside bomb south of Baghdad, a ministry official said. Most of the deaths came when three car bombs parked at separate but nearby marketplaces exploded in quick succession in the eastern Baghdad Shiite neighborhood of Sadr City, killing at least 45 people and injuring at least 68, the ministry official said. Three other car bombings followed. Two of those, outside a Shiite mosque in the Hurriya district of northern Baghdad, killed three people and wounded eight. The bombs exploded in close succession shortly before 9 p.m. (2 p.m. ET). A third a few hours earlier injured at least five civilians in a predominantly Shiite area of southwestern Baghdad, according to the ministry. Wednesday's series of bombings echoed an incident earlier this month, when seven car bombs detonated within about four hours. The U.S. military blamed al Qaeda in Iraq for what it called coordinated attacks. Sadr City is a heavily populated Shiite area, with an estimated 2.5 million people packed into a 25-square-kilometer area. The district was a stronghold of Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr's Mehdi Army, but most of the fighters went underground after fierce fighting in April 2008. In a seventh bombing Wednesday night, at least five people died and three were wounded south of Baghdad, a ministry official said. A roadside bomb struck a minibus in Hor Rajab, a predominantly Sunni area on the southern outskirts of Baghdad. The casualties were all civilians, the official said. There has been an uptick in bombings and attacks in recent weeks, mainly targeting Shiites and Shiite areas. Last Thursday and Friday, five suicide bombings, as well as other attacks in Baghdad and Diyala province, left almost 160 people dead and 275 wounded. Earlier Wednesday, U.S. and Iraqi troops were ambushed in northern Iraq, according to Maj. Derrick Cheng, spokesman for the U.S. military's Multi-National Division-North. The troops were on a joint mission in Riyadh, southwest of Kirkuk, where coalition forces are working with local police to provide micro-grants to small businesses, Cheng said. Several individuals attacked the troops using at least one grenade and small arms fire, he said. Cheng said two of the attackers reportedly were killed and another two were wounded. A woman reportedly was injured by shrapnel from the grenade, but was treated and released, he said. A soldier was reported wounded but was in good condition, Cheng said. So far this month, 15 U.S. soldiers have died in Iraq, compared to nine in March -- most of those in non-combat-related incidents. March's death toll was the lowest monthly toll for the U.S. military since the war began 2003. The Riyadh incident comes at a time of heightened tension between the U.S. military and the Iraqi government, after two Iraqis were killed during a military raid south of Baghdad on Sunday. Iraqi state TV reported that Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki accused U.S. troops of violating the security agreement between the two countries with the raid in Wasit province. CNN's Jomana Karadsheh contributed to this report.","Six car bombs explode in Baghdad, Iraq's Interior Ministry says .

"Don't mess with Russia. That was President Vladimir Putin's message on Friday, the same day a British government source claimed that Russian troops had significantly ratcheted up their military incursion into Ukraine. Moscow doesn't want or intend to wade into any ""large-scale conflicts,"" Putin insisted at a youth forum, state-run ITAR-Tass reported. A few breaths later, he made the point that Russia is ""strengthening our nuclear deterrence forces and our armed forces,"" making them more efficient and modernized. ""I want to remind you that Russia is one of the most powerful nuclear nations,"" the President said. ""This is a reality, not just words."" He later warned, ""We must always be ready to repel any aggression against Russia and (potential enemies) should be aware ... it is better not to come against Russia as regards a possible armed conflict."" The comments came the same day that Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov accused NATO of using ""images from computer games"" to -- in his view -- falsely make the case that Russian troops are in Ukraine. Lavrov said ""hiding the evidence is an outstanding characteristic of the U.S. and many EU countries"" with regard to Ukraine. See the NATO satellite images . The thing is, many in the West don't believe much of anything coming out of Russia. White House spokesman Josh Earnest said Friday that -- whatever the Kremlin says -- the reality is Russian troops are inside the Ukraine and have fired on Ukrainian military positions. ""Those denials are completely without credibility,"" Earnest said. And Russia's military may be digging in deeper in Ukraine. The British government source told CNN on Friday that Russia has moved 4,000 to 5,000 military personnel --  a figure far higher than one U.S. official's earlier claim of 1,000 troops. The soldiers are aligned in ""formed units"" and fighting around Luhansk and Donetsk, said the UK source. And they may soon have company: Some 20,000 troops are on border and ""more may be on the way,"" the source adds. So what's Russia's endgame? Does it simply want to protect civilians or ethnic Russians in Ukraine? Or does it endeavor to develop a land bridge between Crimea -- which split from Ukraine to become part of Russia months ago, amid the unrest following President Viktor Yanukovych's ouster -- and the Russian border? Or perhaps take over all of Ukraine now? The UK source, giving his government's analysis of Russian troop movements, surmised that right now ""the primary role of the current Russian deployments inside Ukraine is probably to assist, support and take the pressure off the separatist forces in order to maintain pressure on Kiev to decentralize. ""However, we are not ruling out more ambitious plans, including a land corridor from the Russian border to Crimea."" After 8 months of conflict, what's next for Ukraine? NATO chief blasts Russia's 'hollow denials' Ukraine has been in crisis since last fall, when political upheaval preceded widespread violence that threatened to tear the Eastern Europe nation apart. If anything, that violence has worsened the past several months -- as pro-Russian rebels dug in and Ukraine's military stepped up its offensive to retake its territory. The U.N. human rights office reports at least 2,593 people killed between mid-April and August 27, and that many innocent civilians have been killed, hurt or trapped in urban areas. Predictably, both sides have taken the high road while blaming each other for humanitarian crisis and for perpetrating violence rather than having fair, sincere negotiations toward a cease-fire. ""When Kiev said that negotiations would begin only after the surrender of those whom they call 'separatists,' the militia are left with no choice but to defend their homes, their families,"" Russia's foreign ministry said in a statement. Western officials say that Moscow hasn't taken any responsibility, whether for its military's on-the-ground involvement or how it can influence rebels. Speaking after a meeting of NATO ambassadors in Brussels, Belgium, Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said what he called ""the serious escalation of Russia's military aggression against Ukraine"" violates Ukraine's territorial integrity and ""defies all diplomatic efforts for a peaceful solution."" ""Despite Moscow's hollow denials, it is now clear that Russian troops and equipment have illegally crossed the border into eastern and southeastern Ukraine,"" Rasmussen said. ""This is not an isolated action but part of a dangerous pattern over many months to destabilize Ukraine as a sovereign nation."" Fighting raging on multiple fronts . Whoever is to blame, whoever is involved, two things that are not in question is that the fighting is continuing and that there's no end in sight. Ukrainian troops have been fighting on two fronts: southeast of rebel-held Donetsk, and along the nation's southern coast in the town of Novoazovsk, about 12 miles (20 kilometers) from the Russian border. Mykhailo Lysenko, deputy commander of the Ukrainian Donbas battalion, on Thursday described the fighting in the south as ""a full-scale invasion."" Analysts suggest that Russia may have sent its forces into Novoazovsk to secure a land route from the border to the Crimean peninsula it annexed from Ukraine in March, and in order to throw Ukrainian forces making gains against besieged rebel forces in the cities of Donetsk and Luhansk off balance. In a statement issued by the Kremlin, Putin said the rebels had halted a Ukrainian military operation in eastern Ukraine that he said had endangered the civilian population and caused many casualties. The UK government source said Russian forces are fighting alongside rebels around Luhansk and Donetsk. It's too early to gauge their impact, though even if propping up the pro-Russian separatists for months longer so that Ukraine's military doesn't next turn its attention to taking back Crimea could be considered a victory. ""At the very least, the Russian deployments are creating the conditions for a frozen conflict going into winter and ... ensure that Kiev is sufficiently distracted ... to prevent it from refocusing its attention on Crimea,"" the source said. Retired Lt. Gen. Mark Mark Hertling, a 37-year veteran who once commanded U.S. soldiers in Europe, thinks that Russia may be aiming higher than that. If Ukraine folds easily to Russia's military might, neighboring nations might have good reason to worry. On the other side, Moscow could lose sway if its efforts fail. ""He is trying to influence the Europeans, and it won't stop just with Ukraine,"" the military analyst told CNN, predicting more Russian military intervention elsewhere. ""This is something where he is trying to counter the influence of the West, and he can't afford to lose in Ukraine.""

"You'd be hard-pressed to find someone who doesn't own a t-shirt; in fact, the ubiquitous garment is a mainstay in most wardrobes. Nevertheless, Olga Mugyenyi and Nahida Beghani have injected new life into the plain white ""tee"" with Definition Africa, a t-shirt store based in Kampala, Uganda. Bright prints, sharp slogans and youthful energy characterize Definition's alternative approach to fashion, where everyday Ugandan life inspires each new design. ""The concept of Definition came up in and around 2009,"" Beghani recalls. ""We felt like there weren't really any products or apparel in the market that really celebrated the local experience,"" she adds. Following its successful launch on Facebook, Definition Africa eventually evolved into a bricks-and-mortar retailer, growing a loyal and enthusiastic customer base since the store's opening in January 2014. Despite the seemingly globalized nature of the fashion world, Definition's success is largely inspired by regional quirks and local collaborations rather than the latest throwaway trend. ""The t-shirts that we design are in theme with life in Uganda, things that we come across, statements, food, and people,"" says Mugyenyi. ""We also have a line that's called 'Signature Tees' where we invite people to submit their designs and if they go through the approval process then they get printed,"" she says. Having recently received the Young Creative Entrepreneur Award from the British Council, Definition Africa has firmly cemented itself as one to watch. However, the practicalities of producing and manufacturing locally-made clothing has proven to be just as difficult as they had anticipated. ""It would've been much easier to source our t-shirts in China, it would be much easier to get our stationery produced in Dubai, but we had to kind of stick to what we started with and that has been difficult,"" says Mugyenyi. Currently, all of Definition's products are made and sourced in various African countries -- with blank t-shirts sent in from factories in Uganda, Kenya and Tanzania to be printed in-house. Ink, zips and embellishments, however, are mostly sourced from outside the continent, but the company aims to ensure that all components are 100% African-made in the future. This commitment to homegrown design is part of a greater ambition to support local and regional industry, the entrepreneurs say, and so far, consumers have been taking note. Mugyenyi adds: ""One of the things that makes Definition what it is, is that the products are supposed to be entirely African in subject matter and as well as where the material comes from.""

"The government of key U.S. ally Turkey began to crack this week. There are rumblings that an Islamic cleric living in the United States may have something to do it. But prosecutors in Istanbul have said corruption is the culprit. Three Cabinet ministers resigned their posts Wednesday, days after their sons were arrested or temporarily detained in an anti-graft sting, semiofficial news agency Anadolu reported. One of them -- Urbanization and Environment Minister Erdogan Bayraktar -- went further than the other two, not just resigning his Cabinet position but also calling on Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan to step down. On live television in Turkey, Bayraktar said Erdogan asked him to resign and make a statement that would ease pressure on Erdogan. Upset at this, Bayraktar declined to make the statement but stepped down from his Parliament seat as well as his Cabinet post, and called on Erdogan to resign ""to make the people more comfortable."" ""They sent us two papers today -- one for our resignation, the other a statement. Of course I want to make it easier for my party. However, I find this wrong,"" said Bayraktar, whose son was briefly detained in the roundup but later released. Economy Minister Zafer Caglayan and Interior Minister Muammer Guler, whose sons were also arrested in the probe, also resigned Wednesday. Erdogan accepted the resignations, Anadolu reported. The sons were detained in a roundup that included the head of a public bank, several bureaucrats and high-profile businessmen. It came after a two-year probe by the Istanbul Prosecutor's Office into allegations of corruption including money laundering, gold smuggling and bribery. Also, local media outlets reported that former interior minister Idris Naim Sahin resigned from Erdogan's ruling Justice and Development Party or AKP. Sahin, who served as interior minister before Guler, will retain his seat in Parliament. The sweep comes in the runup to local elections in Turkey. Erdogan had been expected to reorganize his Cabinet, because some of his ministers will be running for office in March. Late Wednesday, he announced a Cabinet reshuffle, naming 10 new people. ""I had mentioned previously that there was the possibility of change by the end of the month. Some (ministers) asked to be removed. Some left their positions. Some are my decisions, which I submitted to the President and he has approved,"" Erdogan said. Efkan Ala was tapped as interior minister, Idris Gulluce as urbanization and environment minister, and Nihat Zeybekci was announced as the nation's new economy minister. Turkey bans journalists from police stations . Political rivalry . One of Erdogan's old allies, now a rival, could be having an influence on the crackdown, which Erdogan has called a ""dirty, dirty operation"" aimed at toppling his government. Erdogan appears to be in an open power struggle with former political backer Fethullah Gulen. Gulen is an Islamic cleric living in self-imposed exile in Pennsylvania, and his supporters are thought to be in key positions within the police force and the judiciary. Top government officials accused Gulen recently of trying to establish a ""parallel state"" within the Turkish government. The Hizmet Movement, the name preferred by Gulen's followers, has in the past thrown its support behind the Erdogan-led AKP. But the two have been publicly at odds over the last month. ""It was a forced marriage and now it's an ugly divorce,"" said Ahmet Sik, a journalist who wrote a book on Gulen and his influence within the judiciary and the police force. Retaliation? In the wake of the arrests, Guler, who as interior minister controls the police force, dismissed scores of senior police officers. The government justified the purge by accusing them of carrying out the corruption arrests outside the chain of command. Journalists were hindered from covering the mass firings. Journalists accredited with the Turkish police were ordered to hand in their credentials as well as keys to the media briefing rooms in some police stations. ""If there are any developments or press statements press members will be invited,"" read a statement from the police. Reporters who had long worked the police beat said the ban was unprecedented. According to press reports, Guler had no prior knowledge of the corruption probe that led to the detention of his son and the sons of the other ministers. He has denied any wrongdoing. Erdogan has repeatedly claimed, since the corruption arrests began on Tuesday, that international organizations with branches inside Turkey are trying to destabilize the country. ""This country has never been and never will be the operational space of international organizations. We will not allow the interest lobby, the war lobby, the blood lobby to carry out an operation under the guise of a corruption operation,"" he said during a speech on Sunday.","Recep Tayyip Erdogan announces a Cabinet reshuffle .

"(CNN) -- BP resumed pumping heavyweight drilling mud Friday in its attempt to cap a breached oil well in what the company's top executive described as an ""environmental catastrophe."" The oil giant has measured ""some success"" with a procedure known as ""top kill,"" which had never been tried a mile under the ocean's surface, said Tony Hayward, BP's chief executive officer. The oil leak stopped when heavy drilling mud was pumped into the well at high pressure but it was not clear whether the operation would permanently halt the flow, Hayward said. ""Clearly while we're pumping mud, there is no oil and gas coming into the sea,"" he said. A thick brown stream of liquid seen gushing from the broken pipe into the water was almost entirely composed of water-based mud -- not oil, he said. ""It's like an arm-wrestling match of two equally strong forces,"" said BP's managing director, Robert Dudley. He predicted the company would know by Sunday morning if it is working. Supply ships on the surface are loaded with about 50,000 barrels of mud, and backups with more of the substance could be moved in quickly, he said. U.S. Coast Guard Adm. Thad Allen, who is leading the federal government's oil spill response efforts, said the goal is to send enough mud down into the breached well bore to eliminate the upward pressure from the oil and clear the way for a cement cap to be put into place. ""So while I said the hydrocarbons had been stopped, that does not mean the exercise is over,"" Allen said. BP suspended the effort Thursday after determining that too much of the viscous substance was escaping via the breach instead of going down the well. During that suspension, BP tried another technique -- known as the ""junk shot"" -- pumping solid materials such as rubber balls and other debris, Hayward said. The junk shot began Thursday afternoon and concluded early Friday. Asked whether the junk shot helped, BP Chief Operating Officer Doug Suttles said, ""We believe that it is helping to some degree, but it is very, very difficult to interpret each of those cases."" ""Top kill"" efforts will continue until at least Sunday morning, Suttles said. ""We will continue with this operation until such time as it's either successful or we believe it won't be successful,"" said Suttles. ""I think the key thing here is to exercise patience."" If the ""top kill"" fails, the next step would be to place a ""lower marine riser package"" -- basically a custom-built cap -- over the leak, Suttles said. He added that several versions of the device are ""waiting to go."" If they fail, he said, BP engineers would try placing a second blowout preventer on top of the first, which failed catastrophically. The failed blowout preventer is a 48-foot-tall, 450-ton apparatus that sits atop the well 5,000 feet underwater, which failed to cut off the oil flow after the April 20 explosion aboard the Deepwater Horizon drilling platform left 11 men missing and presumed dead. The Gulf oil spill is the largest in U.S. history. Government scientists said Thursday that as many as 19,000 barrels (798,000 gallons) of oil were spewing into the ocean every day, making this disaster perhaps twice the size of the Exxon Valdez incident. Previously, government scientists had said 5,000 barrels (210,000 gallons) of oil were gushing out every day. On May 17, Hayward had said the spill would have a modest impact on the environment. He upgraded his assessment on Friday. ""This is clearly an environmental catastrophe,"" Hayward said. ""There's no two ways about it."" He sympathized with Gulf residents who have expressed anger over the disaster. ""I understand perfectly why everyone is angry and frustrated that this leak has not been stopped,"" he said. ""We want it stopped and we are doing everything we can to stop the damn leak. And we are going to continue to do everything we can to stop the damn leak."" Hayward cited ""at least seven failures"" that conspired to bring about the disaster. Under intense political pressure to take control of the situation, President Obama toured the region Friday -- his second visit since the April 20 explosion aboard the Deepwater Horizon drilling platform triggered the spill and left 11 men missing and presumed dead. ""We want to stop the leak, we want to contain and clean up the oil and we want to help the people in this region return to their lives and livelihoods as soon as possible,"" the president told reporters. Surrounded by more than a dozen Gulf-area politicians and officials, the president called the oil spill ""an assault on our shores, on our people, on the regional economy and on communities like this one."" Obama said it would be welcome news if BP's top kill effort succeeds in stopping the runaway flow from the well, but noted that other efforts are also under way. Oil spill demystified: A glossary . ""A team of some of the world's top scientists, engineers and experts -- led by our energy secretary and Nobel Prize-winning physicist Steven Chu -- has for some time been exploring any and all reasonable contingency plans,"" he said. Obama said he has directed Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano and Allen to triple the manpower in places where oil has hit shore or appears within a day of doing so. Information about resources available to area residents and businesses will be posted on whitehouse.gov, he said. ""BP is the responsible party for this disaster,"" he said. ""But as I said yesterday and as I repeated in the meeting we just left, I ultimately take responsibility for solving this crisis. I'm the president and the buck stops with me."" More from Obama's press briefing . He also called on Americans to help by visiting the region. Except for three beaches in Louisiana, all the Gulf beaches are open, safe and clean, he said. After Obama left, several hundred workers who had been shipped in early Friday by BP also left, according to a Gulf Coast official. Jefferson Parish Councilman Chris Roberts told CNN's ""Situation Room"" that the workers were offered $12 an hour to go to the scene at Grand Isle and work while Obama was there and that they left shortly after Obama did. Suttles downplayed the claim Friday evening, saying it is not unusual to see people wrapping up work in the afternoon. iReport: Share your views on the oil spill response . ""These individuals are working out in the heat of the sun. These are long days. They start early in the morning and they stop early in the evening,"" he said. ""So the fact that they were leaving the location late in the afternoon was not unusual. It's not associated with the president arriving."" Suttles added that the workers would be back Saturday morning to continue working. Though about 25 percent of the Gulf of Mexico exclusive economic zone has been put off limits, most federal waters in the Gulf are open to commercial and recreational fishing, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. In a response to some local officials, who have been calling for the Army Corps of Engineers to build a ""sand boom"" offshore to keep the water from getting into the fragile marshlands, Obama said Allen is prepared to authorize moving forward with ""a portion of the idea."" That did not entirely satisfy Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, who has advocated immediate construction of the berms. Noting in a written statement that 107 miles of the state's coast have been oiled, he said, ""We continue to ask federal officials to approve our entire sand-boom plan from the northern Chandeleurs to the Isle Dernieres chain.""

"(CNN) -- French President Francois Hollande will travel to Mali on Saturday, where his nation's troops have been battling Islamist militants for three weeks alongside African forces. Hollande will be accompanied by his defense and foreign ministers, the president's office said in a statement Friday. In addition to major cities, he will also visit the historical city of Timbuktu, which French and Malian troops seized from militants who had controlled it since last year. His office did not provide any other details. The visit comes as troops make major gains in the battle to push out militants in northern Mali. France, Mali's former colonial power, is leading the offensive after militants captured the vast northern desert region, raising fears they would turn it into a haven for terrorists. French-led troops now control the cities of Timbuktu and Gao, along with a swath in between that was an Islamist stronghold for almost a year, the French Defense Ministry said. France sent troops at Mali's request after Islamists seized the strategic town of Konna on January 10. The town is now back in Malian control. Islamic extremists carved out a large portion of the north last year, taking advantage of a chaotic situation after a military coup. They banned music, smoking, drinking and watching sports on television, and destroyed historic tombs and shrines in the region. But with the French-led offensive sending the militants on the run, residents are once again roaming the streets without fear. France has 2,150 soldiers in Mali and 1,000 more troops supporting the operation from elsewhere. West African forces are expected to battle the militants alongside French troops. NATO said it does not plan to join the offensive. ""The United Nations Security Council has decided that it should be an African-led mission,"" said Anders Fogh Rasmussen, the NATO secretary-general. ""And this is also a reason why I don't see a role for NATO as an organization in Mali or in the region. But obviously, I welcome that individual NATO allies have taken action and decided to support the French operation in Mali."" Malian interim President Dioncounda Traore has said his nation will hold elections by the end of July. CNN's Sarah Jones contributed to this report.","In addition to major cities, Francois Hollande plans to visit the historical city of Timbuktu .

"On March 9, Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott, the state's Republican candidate for governor, appeared on a Dallas television station and was asked a straightforward question. Would he veto, as Gov. Rick Perry did last year, the Texas version of the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, a bill that would allowed women to file equal pay claims in state courts? Abbott wouldn't say. Instead, he smiled and held forth for a few moments about the importance of women being paid the same wages as men. The campaign of his Democratic opponent, state Sen. Wendy Davis, quickly roared to life. Davis, who shepherded the equal pay bill through the Texas legislature, accused Abbott of dodging the question and demanded a hard answer. Abbott equivocated for 10 days, then said he would veto the bill, handing Davis fresh ammo. ""We need a governor who will fight for economic opportunity for all Texans,"" Davis said at a rally in Austin this week, where supporters waved campaign-sponsored signs reading #EqualPay. ""We need a governor who will fight for that regardless of someone's gender or their race."" The equal pay fight has consumed the Texas race for a better part of a month now, injecting the Davis campaign with fresh energy and a much-needed dose of optimism. For the first time in the race, Davis is playing offense on a policy issue. The flurry of activity in Texas has called attention to a key issue for Democratic candidates this midterm cycle as they try to change the subject from an unpopular President and thorny issues like the Affordable Care Act: wage fairness for women in the workplace. ""It's extremely potent,"" said Democratic pollster Celinda Lake. ""It's the No. 1 issue that gets single women out to vote, but it also unites men and women."" ""We were recently conducting focus groups in Michigan with beefy, 50-year old, white auto workers, and one guy said, 'If the little lady doesn't get paid equally, I have to get overtime, and I can't get that anymore,'"" Lake said. ""While that might not be the most feminist articulation of the policy, men are wildly in favor of equal pay."" Meet 10 visionary women . One equal pay statistic has become a well-worn talking point for Democrats: Women earn 77 cents for every dollar a man earns. President Barack Obama slipped the data point into his 2014 State of the Union speech when he demanded that Congress pass the Paycheck Fairness Act, which would strengthen the 1963 Equal Pay Act signed by President John F. Kennedy. Obama called the income disparity between genders an ""embarrassment"" and proclaimed that ""women deserve equal pay for equal work."" It was one of his biggest applause lines of the evening. Elizabeth Warren, PCCC back Braley for Senate seats . Hardly new fodder for Democrats . The gender pay gap is not attributable to discrimination alone. Studies show that women often take lower-paying jobs than men, and they work fewer hours. Still, while pay disparities vary depending on the occupation -- female teachers make 91 cents on the male dollar, for instance -- men generally take home bigger paychecks than women. The gender pay issue is hardly new fodder for Democrats, who have relied on women voters -- especially unmarried women -- to pull them over the finish line in recent elections. In the Virginia governor's race last fall, Democrat Terry McAuliffe unleashed a sustained assault on his Republican opponent's views on women's health issues. McAuliffe narrowly won the race -- but he won the single women demographic by a staggering 42-point margin. The issue flared during the 2008 presidential campaign, when Obama hammered John McCain and Senate Republicans for blocking the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act. After Obama's victory, the legislation became the first bill he signed as president. The fair pay debate surfaced again in 2012, when Obama's re-election campaign hammered Mitt Romney for dodging a question about whether he would have signed the Ledbetter Act. Like many Republicans, Romney said he supported the concept of equal pay but questioned whether federal legislation would solve the problem. But this year's midterm election is a different beast. With Democratic turnout expected to tumble in a non-presidential year, party strategists are seizing on equal pay as a way to galvanize the base, raise money and once again paint Republicans as tone deaf on women's issues. ""It's just an incredibly important issue for women,"" said Stephanie Schriock, the president of EMILY's List, a group that backs Democratic women candidates. ""We see it in our polling, but also in everyday life, that it's an economic hurt for families. And right now we have a Republican party that is so disinterested in winning over women voters that they are floundering on no-brainer issues like supporting equal pay."" Schriock pointed to a February survey by American Women, an EMILY's List partner, that showed wide majority support among both men and women for ""ending gender discrimination"" in the workplace and passing the Paycheck Fairness Act. Poll: GOP has a 2014 enthusiasm advantage . Others trying to make equal pay an issue . Davis is the most famous Democrat to make equal pay a centerpiece of her campaign, but smaller-scale efforts are underway in campaigns up and down the ballot, in local and federal races. Democratic Senate candidates in Republican-leaning states, such as Alison Lundergan Grimes in Kentucky, Natalie Tennant in West Virginia, and Michelle Nunn in Georgia, have raised the issue in campaign fundraising e-mails and list-building petitions. A volley of them were fired off in January, on the five-year anniversary of the Ledbetter Act signing. ""Mitch McConnell had a chance to be a part of history five years ago, too,"" Lundergan Grimes wrote in one fundraising e-mail chiding her Republican opponent. ""Instead, he did what he's done for nearly 30 years when called upon to lead: he refused to answer -- failing to stand for Kentucky's women and families by voting against the legislation."" By keeping the issue in the news, Democrats hope to benefit in the long term by showcasing GOP presidential hopefuls who oppose equal pay protections. One of them, Rick Perry, vetoed the equal pay legislation that Davis has been touting in the governor's race. This week, Perry called the war of words over equal pay ""nonsense"" -- a remark that Democrats will almost certainly use against him if he becomes the GOP presidential nominee in 2016. Several likely 2016 Republican candidates have come out against equal pay protections, mostly on the grounds that they would encourage lawsuits and cripple the ability of private businesses to set their own pay scales based on merit. Yet while Republicans in Washington have counseled candidates on how to speak more carefully about women's health issues like abortion and contraception, there seems to be no messaging playbook when it comes to equal pay. In the heat of the last presidential race, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio waved off the Ledbetter Act as ""an effort to help trial lawyers collect their fees and file lawsuits."" Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul said the Paycheck Fairness Act would interfere with the free market, comparing it to the way the Soviet Politburo set the price of bread. On the local level, Republican governors like Perry have derided state equal pay laws as redundant given the federal protections already on the books. Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker repealed a pay discrimination law in 2012 for much the same reason. Katie Packer Gage, a former Romney campaign adviser who co-founded Burning Glass Consulting, a firm that advises Republicans on how to appeal to women voters, said Democrats are using equal pay ""to distract women from real issues."" But Gage urged Republican candidates to be more sensitive when rebutting the issue. ""Look, women view this as a problem,"" she said. ""When you talk to women, and you see this in focus groups, they feel it's a problem. They have anecdotal experience, they feel it, but they don't have very specific data. Our party's response has been to push back on it and say it's a not a problem. ""I have advised clients when you are asked your position on this, your response needs to be, 'Duh, of course men and women should be paid the same for equal work!,'"" Gage added. ""This was settled law back in 1963, and Republicans voted for it. Our party is not quick enough to push back on the fact that we already have a law in this country that requires equal pay for equal work.""

"Jim Jeffords, who shifted the balance of power in the Senate when he bolted from the Republican Party in 2001, died on Monday. The former Vermont lawmaker had been in declining health and died at a military retirement center in Washington, according to a one-time aide, Diane Derby. He was 80. Jeffords was a veteran member of the House before moving to the Senate in 1989, where he was one of the most liberal Republicans. Jeffords embraced issues like education and the environment. Years later, many in the party believed he single-handedly sank a sweeping tax cut package proposed by then-President George W. Bush, forcing the White House to negotiate a smaller deal with Democrats. Political tensions boiled over and Jeffords became an independent in 2001 and caucused with Democrats. The drastic step shifted Senate control to Democrats. He left the Senate in 2007. President Barack Obama said in a statement that Jeffords never lost the ""fiercely independent spirit that made Vermonters, and people across America, trust and respect him"" and that he ""voted his principles, even if it sometimes meant taking a lonely or unpopular stance."" People we've lost in 2014 .","Jim Jeffords handed Democrats control of the Senate when he left the GOP .
