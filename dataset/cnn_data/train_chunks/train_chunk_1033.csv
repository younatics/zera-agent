"After more than half a century of intrigue and mystery, the U.S. Department of Energy has declassified documents related to a Cold War hearing for the man who directed the Manhattan Project and was later accused of having communist sympathies. The department last week released transcripts of the 1950s hearings on the security clearance of J. Robert Oppenheimer, providing more insight into the previously secret world that surrounded development of the atomic bomb and the anti-communist hysteria that gripped the nation amid the growing power of the Soviet Union. Oppenheimer led the Manhattan Project at Los Alamos National Laboratory, which developed the atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki during World War II. The secretive projects involved three research and production facilities at Los Alamos, New Mexico, Oak Ridge, Tennessee, and Hanford, Washington. The father of the atomic bomb:  The U.S. Department of Energy has declassified documents related to the Cold War hearing on J. Robert Oppenheimer (pictured) who directed the Manhattan Project . Documents: After more than half a century of intrigue and mystery, the U.S. Department of Energy has declassified documents related to a Cold War hearing for the man who directed the Manhattan Project . Unfair Treatment: The documents provide insight into the previously secret world that surrounded development of the atomic bomb and the anti-communist hysteria that gripped the nation . The once-celebrated physicist lost his security clearance following the four-week, closed-door hearing. Officials also alleged that Oppenheimer's wife and brother had both been communists and he had contributed to communist front-organizations. Steven Aftergood, director of the Project on Government Secrecy for the Federation of American Scientists, said the release of the documents finally lifts the cloud of secrecy on the Oppenheimer case that has fascinated historians and scholars for decades. 'This was a landmark case in U.S. history and Cold War history,' Aftergood said. 'It represents a high point during anti-communist anxiety and tarnished the reputation of America's leading scientist.' The Energy Department had previously declassified portions of the transcripts but with redacted information. Atomic Bomb: A dense column of smoke rises more than 60,000 feet into the air over the Japanese industrial port of Nagasaki, the result of an atomic bomb, the second ever used in warfare on August 8 1945 . Poorly treated: Portrait of Dr. J. Robert Oppenheimer in his office at the Institute of Advanced Study in Princeton following his hearings years prior . Aftergood, who had only scanned the hundreds of pages of newly declassified material, said the documents provided more nuanced details about the development of the atomic bomb, debates over the hydrogen bomb and reflection on atomic espionage. The documents also show how unfairly Oppenheimer was treated immediately following World War II, Aftergood said. Most of the material would be of more interest to scholars because of the inside debates and discussions, Aftergood said. After the Manhattan Project, Oppenheimer served as director of Princeton's Institute for Advanced Study until he retired in 1966. President Lyndon B. Johnson later tried to erase the embarrassment of Oppenheimer's treatment by honoring him with the Atomic Energy Commission's Enrico Fermi Award in 1963. Oppenheimer died of throat cancer in 1967. Accused of being a communist: Dr. J. Robert Oppenheimer, of the California Institute of Technology and the University of California, and head of the Los Alamos Group of Scientists who developed the atomic bomb .

"A father stabbed his estranged wife to death before killing himself as their daughters slept upstairs after she started a new relationship with a teenage toyboy, an inquest has heard. David Stringer, 32, killed his 29-year-old wife Hayley with a  kitchen knife while three young girls - aged 11, eight and seven - were asleep at the family home in Walsall, West Midlands. Mr Stringer then committed suicide by stabbing himself in the chest with the same knife. David Stringer, 32, killed his 29-year-old estranged wife Hayley at the family home in Walsall, West Midlands, while her three young daughters were asleep upstairs . The couple's bodies were discovered hours later by Mrs Stringer's new boyfriend, 19-year-old Matthew Read. The Stringers, who had been together for 11 years and married for 10 years, separated in March this year. They had two children together and Mrs Stringer had a third daughter from a previous relationship - all three of whom were in the house at the time. An inquest heard that Mrs Stringer, a factory worker, had started a relationship with Mr Read around the time that she split from her husband. Detective Constable Brindley also told the hearing Mr Stringer had previously made threats to kill Mr Read and commit suicide but these had not been reported to police. Recording a verdict of unlawful killing for Mrs Stringer and suicide for Mr Stringer, Black Country Coroner Zafar Siddique said it was a 'double tragedy', particularly for the children involved. He said: 'Having considered all the various evidence my conclusion in relation to Hayley is that she was unlawfully killed. Their bodies were found by Matthew Read, Mrs Stringer's 19-year-old boyfriend . 'In respect of David I'm satisfied that he took his own life and therefore he committed suicide. 'This is a double tragedy for both families involved, particularly the children involved, and my heart and sincere condolences go out to both sets of families.' Sandwell Coroners' Court heard how Mr Stringer returned to the family home where Mrs Stringer lived with their children in the early hours of May 10. The pair were said to have argued before Mr Stringer repeatedly stabbed his wife, later turning the knife on himself. Mr Read returned to the house at 3.50am after finishing a night-shift. He found the couple in the hall wayand living room. Both were pronounced dead at the scene by paramedics. The inquest heard Mr Read was arrested at the scene and initially treated as a suspect until he was later ruled out after officers checked with his workplace. Detective Constable John Brindley, from West Midlands Police, told the hearing at Smethwick Council House how they arrested Mr Read because of the circumstances in which the bodies were found. He said: 'Enquiries were made with his work and he was captured on CCTV leaving his work. He would then have to ride his bike from Cannock to Walsall. 'The timings for the journey all fit into line. He was eliminated from the inquiry.' He had previously told the hearing:  'The two persons had been in a relationship for about 11 years, married for about 10 years and had two children in that period aged eight and seven. 'Hayley had a further child aged 11 from a previous relationship. The relationship between Hayley and David came to an end around March 29 this year. We know that Hayley commenced a relationship with another man around that time. Detective Constable Brindley told the hearing Mr Stringer, pictured, had previously made threats to kill Mr Read and commit suicide but these had not been reported to police . The couple had been married for ten years and had two daughters together. Mrs Stringer, pictured left, had an elder daughter from a previous relationship . 'It would appear that they (Hayley and David) weren't getting on and decided to split. It was just prior to 3.50am on May 10, a call was received to ambulance control from a distressed person, Matthew Read. 'He said that the husband had come back and stabbed Hayley. When asked who he meant, he said David Stringer who was also there and had a knife present in his own body. 'The police attended the scene where they found exactly what Mr Read had said. He (Mr Read) was actually at work and had made arrangements to arrive when he had finished his shift. 'The first officer there noticed the front door open, Mr Read was standing in the hallway. There was blood on the door and a female later identified as Hayley had numerous injuries and appeared deceased on the floor. 'A male later identified as David also appeared deceased within the lounge and hallway in a sitting position against a wall. Sandwell Coroners' Court heard how Mr Stringer had returned to the family home where Mrs Stringer lived with their children, above, in the early hours of May 10 . 'Obviously there were children within the premises that were taken to a neighbour. The children were asleep upstairs and were carried asleep from the residence to the neighbours.' Speaking about Mr Stringer's previous threats, he added: 'There were certain references to threats being made, threats to kill being made against Mr Read and David threatening to take his own life as well. 'No complaints were made to the police, they weren't notified of this. That only came to light once the examinations of various mobile phones and computers was conducted. 'From all the evidence and statements that have come to light during this investigation, the conclusion is that David attacked his wife using a large knife from a collection which was at his father's house following which he took his own life.' Mrs Stringer's cause of death was given as multiple stab wounds which caused blood loss, a collapsed lung and an obstruction of her airway. Her husband, who was discovered in a sitting position against a wall with the knife still in his body, died from a single stab wound to the chest. Giving his verdict, the coroner said: 'We heard in evidence that Hayley Stringer and David Stringer were in a long-term relationship, they had a number of children. 'For a number of reasons which isn't clear they decided to end that relationship at the end of March this year. From the evidence Hayley then went on to form a new relationship with a Mr Read. 'On the day of the incident, a call was received from Mr Read that when he arrived home he had seen Hayley and David with significant injuries and stab wounds. 'What has unfolded then was that clearly an argument or altercation had taken place between the two parties whereby David had stabbed Hayley. 'She ultimately died from a number of multiple stab wounds and the cause of death was multiple stab wounds. 'David had received one single stab wound to the chest and the cause of death was a stab wound to the chest.'","David Stringer, 32, killed his 29-year-old wife Hayley with a  kitchen knife .

"A bear has escaped by the skin of its teeth after it was found not to be responsible for the killing of a Polish man. Stanislaw Puchala, 61, was found dead with marks of having been mauled by a bear near the village of Olszanica in the Bieszczady Mountains, southern Poland. The village hunting party sent out to shoot the bear was called off when an autopsy revealed Mr Puchala had been murdered.

Chocolate, crisps  and wine regularly pass her lips, and Pippa claims the real 'secret' to her body is moderation, portion control and regular exercise. 'I grew up with the belief that good health is about moderation in all things, so I'll be celebrating healthy living through exercise, and a little of the naughty stuff sprinkled in - I'm talking chocolate, crisps and occasional glass of wine,' Pippa states in the magazine. And despite the rumours that she joined her sister in a strict no-carb diet in the run up to the Royal Wedding, Pippa insists she has never gone on a fad diet. Known to be a keen sportswomen, Pippa recently, much to the relief of those hoping to achieve her body, admits she is less than strict with her diet, indulging in chocolate, crisps and wine . 'I've never done Dukan, attempted Atkins of exercised religiously seven days a week but I do believe in making healthy choices - keeping refined carbs such as white bread and pasta to a minimum, and sticking to sensible portion sizes.' Instead of restrictive diets she uses exercise to hone her body, sharing  the simple 30-minute total body workout that helps her achieve her toned behind. She swears by four key exercises - ladders, plié squats, wall pushes and the 'classic plank' - that are 'quick and great for toning all over'. Each exercise takes around two minutes to perform, and she recommends a 30 second break between the moves with a two minute rest at the end of each circuit. Pippa says she tries to exercise at least three, and ideally five, times a week and claims it helps her sleep, digestion, mood and energy. And this is only the first of many insights we will be getting into the health and diet of Pippa- and potentially all the Middleton clan . She has now been given a monthly column in Waitrose Weekend Magazine in which to share her diet and exercise tips. She already writes for the supermarket’s food publication Waitrose Kitchen and now plans to share her ‘personal philosophy of healthy eating and exercise’.","Kate's sister is renowned for her toned body .

"Swiss cities Geneva and Zurich are the most 'liveable' places in the world, but London can only manage a lowly 22nd place. This is according to a new study that has ranked the best places to live based on factors such as environment, economy, crime and culture. Geneva and Zurich are followed by Singapore, Copenhagen and Helsinki, while bustling New York can only manage 17th and Tokyo is at 18th. Scroll down for video . Swiss cities Geneva (pictured) and Zurich are the most 'liveable' places in the world but London can only manage a lowly 22nd place . Moscow comes close to the bottom of the rankings at number 62 and Jakarta is the end of the list at number 64, according to the researchers. The list was compiled by scientists from the National University of Singapore, University of California and Curtin University in Australia. Instead of compiling a list of economic powerhouses, they created a measure of 'liveability' in major cities balancing work and social life as well as culture and sustainability. The list was compiled by scientists from the National University of Singapore, University of California and Curtin University in Australia. Zurich was ranked as the second best city in the world . They claim existing city lists often fall into two categories; the first includes those that put a higher value on cities based on economic-financial prowess. 1. Geneva . 2. Zurich . 3. Singapore . 4. Copenhagen . 5. Helsinki . 6. Luxembourg . 7. Stockholm . 8. Berlin . 9. Hong Kong . 10. Auckland . The second ranks cities based on their having a pleasant living environment, a mild climate and a scenic locale. This list, published in the journal World Review of Science, Technology and Sustainable Development, aims to combine the two. Factors taken into account include economic vibrancy and competitiveness, domestic security and stability, socio-cultural conditions, public governance, environmental friendliness and sustainability. 'The rank of a city today is not necessarily a good indicator of its rank in the future,’ the report said. 'Environmental restoration and transport infrastructure improvements already underway in many Asian, and specifically Chinese cities, could see the higher liveability today of European cities outstripped as those developing cities develop further.' Singapore (pictured) came in third, closely followed by Copenhagen and Helsinki, according to latest research . London (pictured) didn't make it into the top ten. In a separate study, the number of people saying they were satisfied with their life in the UK dropped one per cent, from 59 per cent to 58 per cent, in the last seven years. A separate list published last week found people from rich countries like Britain are happier than citizens of poorer nations.

Factors taken into account include economic vibrancy and competitiveness, domestic security and stability, socio-cultural conditions, public governance, environmental friendliness and sustainability. Nearly 60 per cent of people living in the UK rate their happiness as at least a seven out of 10, higher than most other rich countries.

The number of people saying they were satisfied with their life dropped one per cent, from 59 per cent to 58 per cent, in the last seven years. Germany saw a rise of 13 per cent in the same time, possibly because Germans were less affected by the economic downturn than other Western nations.

"The partner of a paramedic who killed herself on the job has called for additional support as figures show an average of two ambulance officers commit suicide every year. Helen Mok took her own life 18 months ago at an ambulance branch at Doncaster, west of Melbourne, where she had gained access to lethal drugs. Her partner of 18 years, Cath Mok, said Helen's death came after years of increasing demands, long hours and the confronting line of work, which slowly and painfully impacted on her mental health.

'It was a job Helen once really loved and she worked so hard to get into it,' Cath told Daily Mail Australia. 'But as time went on it became something else. It became a much darker place.' Helen's story is becoming less of an isolated case within the ambulance sector and will feature on SBS's news program  The Feed on Thursday night. Cath, who had two young children with Helen, said a lot of people assumed the trauma Helen experienced related to 'picking body parts off the road' and 'scraping people back together'. 'But the thing that she found the most traumatic was seeing people calling them because of failures in other areas of the hospital. They were getting called to people with mental health issues that they couldn't actually fix.' Helen started out loving her career as a paramedic but as the years went by it became a darker place, according to Cath . The couple have two young children together, 10-year-old Maisie (left) and seven-year-old Dougal (right) The pressures of shift work and the long hours expected of paramedics was also a major contributing factor to Helen's death. 'There's a lot of pressure for paramedics to continue working long after they're supposed to be finished,' Cath said. Ambulance Employees Australia secretary Steve McGhie told Daily Mail Australia the rising rate of suicides amongst paramedics was highly concerning. 'We've had 13 paramedic suicides (in Victoria) in the last seven years. It's really concerning to us because it used to be a rare occasion. I'm sure the other states would have similar numbers,' he said. 'Pressures of the job, stress, strain, trauma and trying to balance work and family life would be the main factors.' Cath says Helen loved being at home with their two children and was very active within their primary school community . Cath said she was very open and honest about Helen's death with their children and used the words mental illness and depression to help them understand . Helen's manager had committed suicide a year before she took her own life. Another colleague did the same three weeks after Helen died. 'She used to share a lot about her job with me, but in the last few months she was really withdrawn because she was struggling with having to go to work,' Cath said. 'We had a fight one night when she was really down. She said goodbye to the kids and left abruptly. When she didn't come I assumed she'd gone to a friend's to cool down... but she never came home. 'Two senior police officers and Helen's group manager came to the house the following morning. She'd been found in an ambulance branch.' Dave Toll, who is also a paramedic in Victoria, said in the past six to seven years he has lost eight to 10 friends and colleagues to suicide. But Helen isn't an isolated case within the ambulance sector. There's been 13 paramedic suicides in the past seven years in Victoria, according to Ambulance Employees Australia secretary Steve McGhie . Dave Toll, who is also a paramedic in Victoria, said in the past six to seven years he has lost eight to 10 friends and colleagues to suicide . 'The fatigue, the 10 hours with no breaks, the 14 hour night shifts, the missing of family events. These guys are paramedics because they want to help people. It's why they do the job… and they push themselves too far,' Dave told The Feed. Fellow ambulance officer Nicole said at first she wasn't aware of how her work was affecting her, but over time her view began to change. 'I had a bunch of suicide plans for when I got old. It's something that I've often talked to other paramedics about,' she said. Ambulance Victoria said they had ongoing plans to reduce these risks amongst employees. 'Ambulance Victoria recognises the challenging environment that our paramedics operate in and take the health of our staff very seriously,' a spokesperson said via a statement. David said 10 hours without a break and 14 hour night shifts took its toll on many paramedics . Fellow ambulance officer Nicole has admitted to making suicide plans for when she was older . 'We have also commenced a research project to explore potential roster options that meet our service delivery while allowing for a reduction in shift length. 'Ambulance Victoria understands the risk of fatigue in the challenging environment that emergency services operate in.' Cath has not made contact with Ambulance Victoria since Helen died, but is currently still urging the coroner to investigate her death. 'The cause of death wasn't a question, but the circumstances surrounding her death, I felt, needed to investigated,' she said. 'I put in a request a month after she died and they still haven't decided. 'What I would hate is for nothing to change. It’s not just Helen, it’s all of the paramedics that working and all of those who have stopped working because they can’t handle it. 'I feel dismay at the thought they won’t investigate. I don’t think it’s a safe place and it’s the responsibility of the employer to mitigate those risks.'

"The UK economy is being given a much-needed boost - and it's thanks to Middle Eastern visitors who are splashing out on hotel rooms. Middle Eastern visitors are forking out an average 61 per cent more per night for hotel rooms in the UK than the average national rate of £105. Travellers from the region paid an average £169 per night on accommodation in the first half of 2014, making them the highest paying visitors to the UK, even though this rate reflected a six per cent fall from the £180 paid in the same period in 2013. London is given a boost as Middle Eastern tourists spend their cash in top hotels (file photo) Mexican tourists, some pictured with the Royal Navy, are the second most generous visitors to the UK . While Middle Eastern tourists were certainly well ahead of the pack, other nations also paid significantly more than the average national rate. Mexico came second in the list of top international spenders, shelling out an average £146 per night after a four per cent increase. Brazil was not far behind on £141, showing no change on the average price paid last year. The most generous Europeans were the Russians, who came in fourth place at £140 per night after a 13 per cent increase. The report from Hotels.com showed that hotel prices paid by international visitors were on the rise in 2014 compared with 2013, with 32 of the 36 nations analysed paying more in the first six months of the year than in the same time period the previous year. It may be out of a lot of people's price range, but The Savoy is a viable option to Middle Eastern tourists . The average spend of tourists from abroad and what their spend was in 2013 compared with this year . As well as Russia, Taiwan and Spain also experienced the highest percentage increase in the table with a 13 per cent price rise, taking their average price paid to £117 and £111 respectively. Along with the Middle East, the only others to fall were Australia, down two per cent to £115, while China and Hong Kong both dropped one per cent to £133 and £122, respectively. Lizann Peppard from Hotels.com said: 'The UK's internationally central location, rich heritage and beautiful landscapes seem to bring out the urge to splurge in international visitors. 'Middle Eastern visitors have the most expensive tastes when visiting the UK, ahead of Latin American, European and Asian visitors. The overall price rise and continued high spending from international visitors is good news for the UK hotel industry.'","Visitors from the Middle East spend 61% more than national average .

"The Seattle City Council voted unanimously Monday to replace Columbus Day with Indigenous Peoples' Day in the city, ABC News reports. Many  gathered at the Seattle city hall building to hear the Council's decision. The resolution will celebrate the culture and contributions of Seattle's Native American and Indigenous community on the second Monday in October -- the same day as the federally recognized Columbus Day, Fox News reports. The Native American community in Seattle views this decision as a progressive step, however, not everyone is happy about the Council's decision. Unanimous: The Seattle City Council voted unanimously Monday to replace Columbus Day with Indigenous Peoples' Day in the city . The Associated Press reports that several Italian-Americans claim the Council's decision to celebrate Indigenous Day disregards the Italian heritage of many. K5 reports that the Native American protesters said, at a public meeting following the Council's decision, that they're not against all Italians, 'just this one,' referring to the Italian explorer Christopher Columbus who is said to have discovered and landed in the Americas Oct. 12, 1492. Columbus Day is not a legal state holiday in Washington. Lisa Marchese, of The Order of Sons of Italy, said that the Council's decision tells the Italian-American community that the city no longer deems Italian heritage worthy of recognition. Ralph Fascitelli, an Italian-American living in Seattle spoke outside of the Council's meeting, according to AP, saying that the Italian-American community in Seattle has no issue with the idea of the new holiday. Rather the community has an issue with the fact that the holiday comes at the expense of another holiday, one which celebrates Italian heritage. Children: One Native American woman said that celebrating the man who is responsible for the slaughter of millions of native people 'internalizes genocide in our children' 'This is a big insult to those of us of Italian heritage. We feel disrespected,' Fascitelli said. 'America wouldn't be America without Christopher Columbus.' During public comment at the meeting, one Italian-American man asked the question 'But why the second Monday in October?' Fawn Sharp, president of the Quinault Indian Nation on the Olympic Peninsula, got a round of applause at the meeting when she said 'Nobody discovered Seattle, Washington.' 'This action will allow us to bring into current present day our valuable and rich history, and it's there for future generations to learn,' Sharp continued. One Native American woman said that celebrating the man who is responsible for the slaughter of millions of native people 'internalizes genocide in our children.' Change: Minneapolis designated to replace Columbus day with Indigenous Peoples' Day, South Dakota also recognizes the community by celebrating Native American Day . 'It makes them ashamed to be who they are,' the woman said outside of the meeting. 'I personally felt it myself growing up and it's just time to change it so that [our children] can be proud of themselves and not honor a man that murdered their family.' AP reports that Seattle Mayor Ed Murray is expected to sign the resolution Oct. 13. Council member Nick Licata, an Italian-American, said that he does not view the Council's decision as taking something away, he views it as a way to allow everyone to celebrate a new day where everyone's strength is recognized. Council member Bruce Harrell said the Council is 'celebrating the triumph of the indigenous people.' 'We're going to all celebrate, because we're celebrating that spirit that we all have in common,' Harrell said at the meeting. Seattle isn't the only city recognizing the rich history of its Native American and Indigenous community. Earlier this year, ABC News reports, Minneapolis  replaced Columbus day with Indigenous Peoples' Day. South Dakota also recognizes the community by celebrating Native American Day.","Seattle Italian-Americans are insulted by the Seattle City Council's decision to hold Indigenous Peoples' Day on the same day as the federally recognized Columbus Day .

"In life grandmother Lesley Emerson was a prolific texter, never more than an SMS away from her nearest and dearest. So when she lost her battle with cancer at the age of 59, her family decided to bury her with her mobile phone as a way of commemorating something they loved about her. To ease their grief they even sent her text messages with all the family news. But nothing could have prepared them for what was about to happen. Lesley Emerson was buried with her mobile phone when she died so her family could text her as a way of dealing with their grief. But Sheri Emerson (pictured with her uncle Graham Emerson) received a reply which said: I'm watching over you.' The mysterious reply came more than three years after Mrs Emerson's death, despite O2 promising to put the phone number out of service . Mrs Emerson, from South Shields, died from bowel cancer in July 2011 at the age of 59 . Three years after Mrs Emerson had passed away in 2011, her granddaughter Sheri’s blood ran cold when she received a return message. ‘I’m watching over you, you’ll get through this, you’ll be all right,’ the text read. Miss Emerson, 22, a care worker from South Shields, South Tyneside, said: ‘I felt sick when I read it, I was in shock. ‘Obviously we know that Nan wasn’t going to ever reply, it was just something we did as a comfort for ourselves because she loved to text.’ She also received another message which read: ‘I’m watching over you and it’s all going to get better. Just push through.’ 'I'm watching over you, you'll get thought this, you'll be all right': Ms Emerson (left) received the reply a day after she sent a text to her dead grandmother (right) After Lesley, pictured with her sons John and Graham (right), died, network provider O2 promised the number she used would not be passed on to a new customer - but it was recycled and given to another phone user . So Miss Emerson decided to investigate, and sent a response demanding to know who was responsible. Eventually she received an apology from a man who had been given Mrs Emerson’s number a few weeks previously when he signed up to mobile operator Giffgaff. He said he had started to receive texts from unknown phone numbers, and thought they were hoaxes from friends. To join in the fun, he responded – not realising the upset they were causing. After Mrs Emerson passed away, her son John said he received assurances from O2 that his mother’s number would never be used again. Mr Emerson, from Whitburn, South Tyneside, said: ‘We are a big family of texters. If we ever fell out or had something to say, we’d always send a message – that’s why we buried her with her phone. ‘I can’t bear to visit Mum’s graveside. For me it is a way to still feel connected to her. So to think someone else now has our Mam’s number is just awful. We can’t believe O2 has done this.’ O2 said that when a number is disconnected, it is placed in a general pool for reuse and this should’ve been explained. O2 is now liaising with Giffgaff to try to retrieve the number for the family. As for the prankster, no one answered the phone yesterday. Graham rang his mother's phone and spoke to a man who had been using the number for the last few weeks . Mrs Emerson was buried in Harton Cemetery, South Shields, alongside her favourite possessions .","Lesley Emerson, 59, was buried with her phone after dying in July 2011 .

'So for our engagement shoot we wanted to step away from the norm and do something to reflect our fun relationship. 'I spotted an advert online from a lovely girl in Bangor who was selling her wedding dress. I emailed her and told her what it was for and she was more than willing to sell it to me.

"As fears grow that the deadly Ebola virus is spreading one of fashion's biggest names has expressed her concerns and plans to help raise awareness. Naomi Campbell, the world-famous supermodel, told Page Six in New York this week that she was becoming increasingly concerned about the disease. 'I'm scared,' she told Page Six. The 44-year-old model expressed her worries to the paper while adding that she has a home in Kenya and works with three orphanages there. Naomi Campbell announced plans to host a Fashion for Relief show in aid of Ebola on Tuesday night . And Naomi is determined to support the fight against Ebola with Vogue.co.uk reporting that she has announced plans for a charity fashion show. The Fashion for Relief catwalk will aim to help victims of the virus but the model revealed that she also hopes to educate the public on the subject as she believes very little is known about the illness. 'People don't have a clear idea about what Ebola is' adding that she wants to make people aware that 'Ebola does not discriminate.' Naomi established Fashion for Relief back in 2005 and has since raised over £4 million for charity, here she poses with Kate Moss (left) and Annabelle Neilson in 2010 in aid of the Haiti crisis . Naomi always walks for her charitable fashion shows, here she wears Alexander McQueen . Naomi's ambitious plans came about on Tuesday night after attending her friend Charlotte Tilbury's make-up launch at Bergdorf Goodman in New York. This was the second time this week that we have seen the model express her charitable side as on Tuesday she posted her #wakeupcall selfie. The new internet craze involves celebrities posting selfies of themselves as they wake up in bed - and aims to raise money and awareness for UNICEF. Naomi posted her #wakeupcall selfie this week, a craze encouraging the public to donate £5 to the Syrian Crisis . Pictures are posted with the hashtag #WAKEUPCALL #UNICEF Text SYRIA to 70007 (to give £5) or http://wwwwakeupcall.org.uk - with each person nominating three others to do the same. Naomi's recent dabble in fund raising is nothing new for the model. Her plans for her charitable catwalk is not the first time that Naomi has called upon the fashion industry to help raise money for charity, with Fashion for Relief having been successfully established back in 2005. The first show raised money for the victims of Hurricane Katrina, and she has since used the project to raise funds following the India terrorist attacks in 2009, the Haiti earthquake in 2010, and the most recent being Japan earthquake and tsunami in 2011.

Her long dark hair straightened and her lips and eyes . covered in black makeup for a rock'n'roll-inspired shoot, . Davila said she aspires to break into commercials or television . because, she explained with a sigh, she is not tall enough to . compete in Miss Venezuela. Davila is one of dozens of girls aged three and up who attend a . modeling academy run by Gisselle Reyes, a former Miss Venezuela . candidate who now prepares girls for the pageant, to learn how . to strut down a runway and perfect pageant etiquette in the . hopes of one day being crowned queen. But even at this glamorous holdout in Caracas' affluent . Altamira area, shortages are crimping plans to follow in Reyes' footsteps - sometimes quite literally. Young girls don their mothers' heels because they can't find . stilettos their size. Teachers usually make them work the runway . barefoot - or strap them into their mothers' oversized shoes . with scotch tape. Girls share makeup and look up YouTube videos on how to make . deodorant at home. Even when they can find the beauty products . they want, some are unable to pay for them as scarcity drives up . prices. Davila estimates the price of a good face powder, for . instance, has increased 500 percent in the last 18 months. Modelling is a career of choice in Venezuela with the country producing more Miss Universes than anywhere except the United States. But even competitors for Miss Venezuela are struggling to get basic supplies . Designer Nidal Nouaihed takes out a dress from a garment bag before fitting it on a client, at his office in Caracas. He struggles to import materials but says the richest customers are still buying . Designer Nidal Nouaihed puts the final touches to a dress worn by a client at his office in Caracas. The outfitter of choice for many beauty queens, he has to battle shortages caused by currency controls . Even aspiring Miss Venezuelas are having trouble getting . their hands on makeup ahead of the pageant next month, said an . instructor who, like the candidates, is barred from speaking to . the press in the run-up to the event. The quest for beauty is one of the rare pastimes that unites . this polarized oil-rich nation. The country boasts seven Miss Universes, a record only . topped by the United States. Venezuela is thought to have one of . the highest rates of breast implants in the world, and plastic . surgeries are sometimes given away as raffle prizes. Venezuela's government says parts of the capital and seven western states were left without electricity after two generating plants had technical problems. The blackout began at 1.30 pm on Thursday in Caracas and lasted about an hour. It caused traffic jams in parts of the capital as street lights stopped working and office buildings were evacuated, causing hundreds of people to walk in the middle of streets because sidewalks were overflowing. Electrical energy minister Jesse Chacon said frequency fluctuations caused problems in ""two large generating machines"" in the Andean region. He said seven of Venezuela's 23 states were affected. The socialist country suffered major blackouts in 2012 and 2013. The administration blamed those outages on sabotage, while opponents said they were the result of government incompetence. But now, doctors say beloved Botox and breast implants can . be hard to come by. When Maria Eugenia Espinoza decided to replace her . eight-year old implants, equivalent to bra size 36, she was told . only implants equivalent to size 42 and up were available. 'Imagine!' said the 46 year-old mother of two. 'I would have . looked like one of those dancing girls!' After searching for five months, Espinoza found implants in . the nick of time for her scheduled operation. Critics have long said Venezuela's cult of beauty . objectifies women and promotes shallow values. And Osmel Sousa, . the president of the Miss Venezuela pageant, gave them more . ammunition when he said last year that ugly women invented the . concept of inner beauty to feel better about themselves. The shortages of beauty products can seem frivolous when . compared with the scarcity of medicines and basic goods from . flour to diapers. Venezuela's scarcity index hit a record 28 percent in . January, indicating that 28 of 100 basic consumer goods were . scarce. The central bank hasn't given data on shortages since. Currency controls first enacted by former socialist . president Hugo Chavez more than a decade ago mean companies . struggle to get hold of the hard currency required for imports. Chavez's hand-picked successor, President Nicolas Maduro, . blames the shortages on rapacious smugglers who scoop up . price-controlled goods, including shampoo, to resell them on the . local black market or even in neighboring Colombia. Venezuela has a history of producing beauty queens including the current Miss Universe, Gabriela Isler, who was crowned in Russia last year (left) and is building a lucrative modelling career (right) as a result . Some government supporters scoff that a pampered elite is . overstating the magnitude of shortages to try to weaken the . president. Venezuela is grappling with 60 percent annual inflation and . sky-high crime rates, and is widely believed to be in recession. Maduro says the country's problems are the result of an . ""economic war"" waged against him by Venezuelan business leaders . and foreign companies. But, paradoxically, some say the hardships are actually . pushing some Venezuelans to dedicate even more time to their . appearance. 'Venezuelans ... might not have enough money to eat, but . they'll have enough money to be beautiful,' said Miguel Torres, . who runs a beauty parlor and used to work for Miss Venezuela. Jeweller George Wittels designs the crowns for many Venezuelan beauty pageants. But the women taking part struggle without access to basic make-up. The cost of face powder has soared 500 per cent in just 18 months . Not only women are affected by the lack of beauty products. Daniel Eduardo, a barber in Caracas spends his days off in search of wax - and uses gelatin when it has run out . Greisy Palacios, a 30 year-old receptionist, spends hours in . lines for everything from soap to nail polish remover and says . she would only leave her house without makeup if she were . depressed. 'If you're not made up, don't go out,' she said as she got . her nails done. But Palacios is finding it ever harder to abide . by that mantra. Recently, for instance, friends alerted her that razors had . arrived at a nearby pharmacy. Palacios dashed out of the office. 'But the lines are like a kilometer long, just for razors!' she said. 'I'm going crazy waiting for the country to change. I . regret voting for Maduro.' The industry that caters to image-conscious Venezuelans is . also feeling the pinch. In a Caracas salon, beautician Janeth Canaveral points to a . small table covered with a dozen pots of creams and wax: 'That's what I have left.' At this rate, Canaveral, a single mother of three, said she . will be forced to shut down her business within a year. 'How do . I start again at age 50?' Shortages are a fact of every day life in Venezuela, with shoppers having to rush when items become available . Imported products are more expensive and scarcer because of currency controls which stop dollars being brought into the country . Barber Daniel Eduardo said he spends Mondays - his day off . - hunting down products. 'If I don't have wax I go out to walk . and look for some,' he said, speaking above pulsating music in a . buzzing salon in Caracas' Catia slum. 'And if there's no wax, well, I use gelatin,' he shrugged. 'You have to be a magician here.' Bigger companies are often better able to cope with red tape . and expensive imports. Nidal Nouaihed, a designer who has dressed the current Miss . Venezuela, hired five people to help him import fabrics like . silk and chiffon. Costs have skyrocketed, but he says his . high-end business is still booming. 'During times of crisis, there's a lot of anxiety and people . want more luxury, want to be more glamorous, they want to . forget,' said Nouaihed. 'We create a parallel world.'","Left-wing government's currency controls mean shortages of make-up .

"Health tracking apps and bands have many uses, but they’re limited because they still need you to enter your eating habits manually. But, researchers are hoping to change this using a sensor, worn around the ear, that automatically tracks how much people eat. Cameras fitted to the device also snap images of the food as it enters the mouth to determine calorie content and other nutrient information. Called Automatic Ingestion Monitor (AIM), the device lets wearers track eating habits. A sensor, worn around the ear (pictured) monitors movements of the jaw. It is activated by vibrations caused by chewing, and filters out movements made by talking. The camera captures images of food to estimate its calorie content . As well as being easier to track food intake, the sensor has the potential to be more accurate than current, manual entries, explained the researchers from the University of Alabama. Called Automatic Ingestion Monitor, or AIM, its creators also claim it has potential to improve weight-loss, and help doctors discover eating patterns in overweight patients. The sensor works by monitoring vibrations in the jaw, made when people chew and is so sophisticated, it can filter out other motions, including talking and yawning. Earlier this year, researchers from Canada created a chin strap that harvests energy from jaw movements, including chewing and talking. It is hoped the device could soon be used to power electronic devices, such as hearing aids, cochlear implants, and even phones. The strap is made from a smart material known as PFC. PFC is a type of piezoelectric material made up of integrated electrodes, and an adhesive polymer matrix. The material is able to produce an electric charge when it stretches, and is subjected to mechanical stress. Jaw movements proved to be one of the most promising candidates for generating electricity from human body movements, with researchers estimating that an average of around seven microwatts of power could be generated from chewing during meals alone. Pictures of the food and drink are compared to an online database, using image recognition, and compared against a list of nutritional information. And, because the device is wearable, it could additionally double-up as a pedometer or activity tracker to compare exercise levels against calorie intake. Dr. Edward Sazonov, an associate professor of electrical and computer engineering at the university: ‘Weight gain comes from an unbalance of the energy we take in versus the energy we expend. ‘We can estimate diet and nutrient intake, but the primary method is self-reporting. 'The sensor could provide objective data, helping us better understand patterns of food intake associated with obesity and eating disorders.’ Already proven viable, further work is being carried out to update the device, make it smaller and more robust, and boost its accuracy. Dr Sazonov intends to test the AIM’s accuracy as an alternative method to tracking energy use from water samples. This current method measures the body’s elimination rate of stable isotopes of hydrogen and oxygen added to the water, a process that can take two weeks. The information can be used to estimate how many calories a person consumes over a period of time, but is expensive and requires medical expertise.

"A New York City cab driver who struck and killed a 9-year-old boy crossing the street on the Upper West Side back in January has now been charged in connection to the accident. Koffi Komlani, 53, was taken into custody October 7 on suspicion of failing to exercise due care when making a left turn from West 97th Street onto West End Avenue on the night of January 10, when he mowed down Cooper Stock, 9, and injured his 51-year-old father, Dr Richard Stock. Komlani initially got off with a ticket for failure to yield to a pedestrian and police ruled the fatal crash an accident. Justice for Cooper: New York City cabbie Koffi Komlani, 53, has been charged with failing to exercise due care, which resulted in the death of 9-year-old Cooper Stock in January . Devastating: The boy's head and body were run over by the front and rear tires on the driver's side, while his father, Dr Richard Stock (right) suffered a leg injury . At the time, Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance stated that he could not charge the cabbie with vehicular homicide because of a law that requires two separate citations to show criminal conduct, reported Eyewitness News. Komlani only had one citation for failure to yield. At the time of the crash, the cabbie had been driving on an expired TLC license for nearly six months. The case sparked an outrage in New York and prompted Mayor Bill di Blasio to implement the Vision Zero program - a citywide initiative whose goal is to put an end to traffic deaths by creating 'slow zones.' If convicted of failure to exercise due care, Komlani could face up to 15 days in jail and a fine of $750. He also stands to lose his driver's license. Got off easy: Komlani was initially cited for failure to yield to a pedestrian, and the January 10 crash was ruled an accident . In violation: At the time of the crash, the cabbie had been driving on an expired TLC license for nearly six months . Following his arrest, Komlani was released on his own recognizance. His next court date is December 4. Dana Lerner, Cooper's mother, was not satisfied with the charge against the man who killed her son. ‘He wasn’t speeding, he just didn’t stop. He hit two people and a child died. That’s not a traffic violation. That’s a crime,’ she told New York Daily News. The accident happened when Cooper and his father were coming home from dinner on January 10 at about 8:30pm. Koffi Komlani turned left from 97th Street onto West End Avenue, striking both as they crossed the avenue. Cooper's head and body were run over by the front and rear tires on the driver's side. His father, Dr. Richard Stock, a radiation oncologist whose patient list includes former Mayor Rudy Giuliani, suffered a minor leg injury. When interviewed by police, Komlani said he did not see the boy and his dad when he turned left on a green light. Heartbroken: Cooper's mother, Dana Lerner, pictured with her husband on the day of their son's memorial service in January, helped push through a new law that strips taxi drivers of their license if they kill or injure a pedestrian . 'Suddenly I heard a boom,' Komlani told police, according to a criminal complaint cited by New York Daily News. 'I never saw anyone. I accelerated to the left and stopped my car. When I got out of the car, someone said to me, ""You just killed a kid.""' During an emotional memorial service for Cooper attended by hundreds of family members, friends and well-wishers, the precocious 9-year-old was remembered for his sense of humor, wit and his love for the New York Knicks, DNAInfo.com reported at the time. In the aftermath of the tragedy, Dana Lerner helped push through a legislation named after her son, intended to suspend taxi drivers' TLC licenses automatically if they kill or injure a pedestrian as a result of failure to yield. The City Council adopted Cooper's Law, sponsored by Councilwoman Helen Rosenthal, in May.","Cooper Stock, 9, and his father, Dr Richard Stock, were struck by a cab while crossing the street on Upper West Side January 10 .

"UN investigators have found proof that a shipwreck found off northern Haiti could not be the Santa Maria, the lost flagship from Christopher Columbus' first voyage to the Western Hemisphere, as a U.S. explorer had claimed. Uncesco said a team of experts who explored the site at the request of the Haitian government determined the wreckage was from a more recent vessel for reasons that included the discovery of copper nails and spikes at the site. The Santa Maria would have used components of iron or wood, the agency said. Christopher Columbus on Santa Maria in 1492, in a paiting by Emanuel Leutze from 1855. Experts now believe they have discovered the wreck of the ship off the coast of Haiti. The Santa María was believed to be a 58 ft (17.7 m) long boat, described as 'very little larger than 100 toneladas' (About 100 tons, or tuns). It was used as the flagship for the expedition, along with the smaller ships Santa Clara, remembered as La Niña ('The Girl'), and La Pinta ('The Painted'). All three of the ships were second-hand (if not third or more) and were not intended for exploration. The report, which the agency said was conducted in a 'neutral and scientific manner,' found that it is possible the actual wreckage may be buried under what is now land because of heavy sedimentation from nearby rivers. U.S. explorer Barry Clifford had announced in May that he believed that he may have found the Santa Maria near the city of Cap-Haitien in what would have been a major archaeological find. The ship struck a reef and was abandoned by Columbus in December 1492 and about two dozen crew members were left behind. Last month, Haiti's culture minister told The Associated Press that preliminary research indicated that the ship was not the Santa Maria and Clifford said that he expected that the UNESCO report would raise doubts. He stood by his claim Monday, calling the UNESCO report flawed because the agency's experts did not consult him or the photos and charts he and his associates made of the wreckage site. Clifford also said the copper components could have been used on the Santa Maria or the material came from another shipwreck that cross-contaminated the site in an area where a number of ships are known to have sunk. The explorer had reached his conclusion based on the location of the wreckage, the presence of the type of stones used for ballast in that era as well as a type of cannon that was there when he first took photos of the site but had apparently been looted when he returned this year. 'All of this information I would have made available to UNESCO and they never asked me for it,' he said by phone from Provincetown, Massachusetts. In its report, UNESCO faulted Clifford for announcing his findings in the media before officially informing the Haitian government of his intention to continue his research in the bay of Cap-Haitien. The explorer said he had a permit. Earlier this year Portuguese-American historian, Manuel Rosa, who has spent 20 years tracing the ship, claimed it was run aground and used as accommodation before finally being burnt by natives. He believes the Santa Maria was purposely dragged up onto the beach of Caracol, re-christened Natividad and ordered shot side-to-side by a cannonball on January 2, 1493. 'This cannonball intentionally disabled and marooned the Santa Maria,' claims Rosa. He believes Columbus had to maroon the Santa Maria for three reasons: So that those left behind could not follow him home, so that Spain was forced to send a rescue fleet, and because the Santa Maria would have been highly dangerous to sail back through the winter seas of the Azores. He also claims in the book 'Columbus-The Untold Story', which is currently looking for an English language publisher, the explorer made sure to take back all the pilots with him, so that, if those marooned could repair the hole in the ship’s hull, they would not know how to reach Spain. 'All of Columbus’s actions were calculated to prevent scrutiny, hide his tracks and allow for Portugal to control the spice trade of India, while denying Spain access to that same route' Rosa said. 'By marooning his own ship, Columbus was free to report to the court of Queen Isabella whatever lies he wanted without the court’s overseers from the 1492 voyage contradicting him, exactly as he did.' The route of the first voyage - and the final resting place of the Santa Maria . During The first voyage of Columbus in 1492, near Hispaniola, Columbus' flagship, the Santa María ran aground, and the waves smashed it to pieces. Leaving several men behind to establish a fort, Columbus set sail for Spain in the Niña. The discovery has been backed up by 2003 researcher that pinpointed the probable location of Columbus's fort nearby. An expedition a decade ago led by Clifford had photographed the wreck - but had no idea the boat was the Santa Maria. However, the team has already found items - including a cannon, have been looted, and is working with the Haitian government 'to ensure the site is protected and preserved. 'I am confident that a full excavation of the wreck will yield the first ever detailed marine archaeological evidence of Coumbus's discovery of America, said Clifford. 'If excavations go well, it may ultimately be possible to lift any surviving remains of the vessel, fully conserve them and put them on display in a museum in Haiti. In 1492, King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella, the rulers of the Spanish kingdoms of Castile and Aragon, agreed to outfit three ships for Columbus, also promising to make him governor of any new lands he might acquire, along with 10 percent of all the wealth that he would bring to Spain. With his fleet of three ships Columbus sailed west on August 3, 1492 with 90 crew, first stopping  at the Canary Islands to make repairs and take aboard fresh food. Then the fleet headed out into the open Atlantic, dubbed the Sea of Darkness . On the 70th day (many days after Columbus had already expected to reach Japan), a lookout sighted land. It was early on the morning of October 12, 1492. They landed on one of the islands of the Bahamas, which Columbus named San Salvador. The island natives came down to the shore to see Columbus' strange ships. Thinking he had reached the East Indies, Columbus called these people Indians. Columbus had discovered what Europeans would soon call the New World of the Americas. Santa María ship model displayed in Fort San Cristóbal, San Juan, Puerto Rico . The voyage sailed on to Asia. He spent the next ten weeks exploring the islands of the Caribbean, landing on the island of Hispaniola, shared today by the Dominican Republic and Haiti. He also landed on Cuba, which he thought was the Asian mainland. Both islands were heavily populated. Near Hispaniola, Columbus' flagship, the Santa María, ran aground. The waves smashed it to pieces. Leaving several men behind to establish a fort, Columbus set sail for Spain in the Niña. On the voyage home, he wrote a report of his discoveries. He offered  'as much gold as they need…and as many slaves as they ask'  if King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella would finance another voyage. As proof of what he could do, he brought them back a small amount of gold, parrots, and plants - as well as some Indians he had kidnapped and enslaved. Previous researcher has found the daring seafarers who went on Christopher Columbus’ second trip to the New World in 1493 had major obstacles to overcome in their journey. Not only were they stepping into the unknown to find a home, but a new study suggests they may have also suffered from scurvy while sailing across the Atlantic. The scurvy killed many of the early colonisers, researchers claim, causing the ultimate demise of the La Isabela settlement within just four years of it being founded. This is according to historic documents and analysis of 27 skeletons buried at Columbus' settlement in what is now the Dominican Republic. Researchers believe the colonisers beat most of the scurvy by the time they died, but the disease may have contributed to a wave of deaths in the early colony. La Isabela, the first permanent European town in the Western Hemisphere, was abandoned within just four years of being established amid sickness and deprivation. Bones of sailors and colonists from graves behind the abandoned village's small churchyard have been unearthed from the site since the 1980s. La Isabela was established in what is now the Puerto Plata, Dominican Republic. It was one of the first European settlements in America. It was founded by Christopher Columbus during his second voyage in 1493 and named after Queen Isabella I of Castile. Historic documents and analysis of 27 skeletons buried at Columbus' settlement in what is now the Dominican Republic suggests the early colonisers suffered from severe scurvy . Hunger and disease is thought to have soon led to mutiny, punishment, disillusion, and more hunger and disease. A group of settlers, led by Bernal de Pisa, attempted to capture and make off with several ships and go back to Spain. La Isabela's demise took place in 1496 when Columbus decided to abandon it in favour of a new settlement, which is now known as Santo Domingo. ‘They were still encased in earth when we started the study. We had to clean the bones to proceed,’ study author Vera Tiesler told National Geographic. Historians have blamed smallpox, influenza, and malaria for the town's failure, but the latest study by Mexico's Universidad Autonoma de Yucatán argues scurvy was the main cause. At least 20 of the 27 skeletons had signs—ridges carved in the outer lining of bones—of what the study describes as 'severe scurvy.' Scurvy, caused by one to three months of vitamin C deficiency, plagued seafarers until the 18th century. Symptoms included lethargy, anaemia, and, the re-opening of old wounds. Researchers suggest the voyagers might have avoided scurvy if they'd sailed directly from Spain to La Isabela - a journey of two months or less. When Columbus and his companions reached the Americas, they landed at a Hispaniola outpost first. ‘It was especially long, this trip - three months. And that's exactly the time scurvy needs to be in full bloom,’ Professor Tiesler said.","U.S. explorer Barry Clifford had announced in May that he believed that he may have found the Santa Maria .

Matthew, 32, is expected to make his first court appearance on Thursday to face a charge of abduction with intent to defile - or sexually molest. While Charlottesville Police Chief Timothy Longo has encouraged residents of his city of 40,000 and beyond to be aware of any sign of Graham, the team directed by Eggeman brings special skills in its search for her. They are trained, for instance, to detect signs of human movement. 'You're looking for signs of passage, you're looking for the very subtle things that most people who are not trained to do this will walk right past,' Eggeman said.

Extradited: Matthew was returned from Texas late Friday after he was found on a beach near Galveston and taken to Charlottesville-Albemarle Regional Jail. He is expected to make his first court appearance on Thursday . The team includes volunteers often called in by the state to look for lost hunters or wayward elders. Others taking part include members of the Albemarle County Sheriff's Office. The searchers number about 20 and include about half as many canine units. Eggeman said the focus of the search is based on investigative leads. He declined to state precisely where searchers were looking Saturday other than to say south of the city in Albemarle County. 'There's a lot of ground to cover,' he said, calling the search part marathon, part process of elimination. Last weekend, more than 1,200 volunteers searched Charlottesville. The search area has widened to the rolling hills outside of Charlottesville. Confusion: This map shows Hannah Graham's movements on the night of Friday 12 and Saturday 13. At 11.50pm she was seen at a party by friends with another male friend. She then seemed to head westward toward the Charlottesville Downtown Mall - where she encountered Matthew . To supplement the professional searchers, Longo has encouraged area residents to search their property for any signs of Graham. He also asked real estate agents to search vacant properties. Longo acknowledged that hope of finding Graham, who was born in Reading, in the UK, dims the more time passes, but he said he remains hopeful. As for Eggeman, he too remains hopeful as leads continue to pour into Charlottesville investigators. Longo has said more than 1,600 tips have come in. 'Every day there's new information, there's a new lead,' Eggeman said. 'It's like building blocks, it's one thing leads to another. 'As long as they have things to pursue, we will continue to search.' Hannah's parents, John and Sue, spoke publicly on Sunday for the first time since their 18-year-old daughter's disappearance last week. Mr Graham said: 'As this nightmare for Hannah, for us, for Hannah's big brother James, her grandparents and extended family continues we would like to make this statement. 'Hannah is our little girl, our only daughter, James's little sister. She is also the oldest granddaughter of her grandparents. She is enormously precious to us.'

Mr Abdulkader has reportedly been on the run since January 21, when he escaped during a transfer from a Brisbane detention centre to a hospital. Immigration officers contacted the female security guard but 'were put through to the maternity ward where she had just given birth to a baby allegedly fathered by a detainee who has been on the run', Hadley told his 2GB listeners. According to the whistleblower who runs the Brisbane Immigration Transit Centre, the female officer's sister was also a Serco security guard. 'They are investigation fraud and rorts being performed by another Serco employee where government funds have been claimed illegitimately,' Hadley said. Steve McMahon, chair of the Prison Officers Vocational Branch of the PSA expressed his concern with private operators, such as Serco, running federal facilities. Serco is a British contractor who is contracted by the Australian government for $1.8 billion . 'These services are and should be solely the responsibility to the government - when handed to private contractors this is what happens,' Mr McMahon told Daily Mail Australia. 'The entry level scrutiny isn't any where near to the same standards as public persons. 'When private operators operate a federal facility their loyalty is between them and their share holders. Mr McMahon said that the government has justified their contract with Serco because  it is more cost effective. 'In the mean time they are cutting corners and not paying their staff properly - which is when things like this happen,' he said. Serco is a British contractor who is contracted by the Australian government for $1.8 billion. The British company has been involved in a number of controversial incidents involving security failures that saw 63 people escape from detention last year. Daily Mail Australia contacted Serco for comment, however a spokesman said it was inappropriate to provide comment while an investigation is under-way. A spokesperson for the Immigration Minister Scott Morrison said, 'The Minister has been advised that the department has requested a formal investigation of the matter by the service provider. 'This matter is also being referred to the AFP.'","Detainee Aziz Ali Abdulkader fled a Brisbane detention facility January 21 .

"Lord Justice Moore-Bick ruled the public interest in the Chinese man's crimes outweighed his children's right to family life . JUDGES yesterday struck a huge blow for ‘common sense’ by ruling a dangerous Chinese robber could be booted out of the UK even though he has two young children living here. MPs said they hoped the ruling marked a landmark moment in the battle to end the rampant abuse of Article 8 of Labour’s Human Rights Act – the right to a so-called family life. It is the first case to come to light since Theresa May changed the law earlier this year to state that Article 8 should  prevent deportation of criminals with jail sentences of more than four years only in the most ‘exceptional cases’. The Chinese immigrant – a failed asylum seeker suspected of involvement in two similar crimes – carried out the terrifying robbery in London in 2010 to try to pay off a £200,000 debt. The now 28-year-old broke into a ground-floor flat in the middle of the night, tied up his two female victims with their own clothes and tape and forced them to hand over bank cards and PINs. When one of his victims wriggled free, she was warned she would be killed if she called the police. The man, who for legal reasons can be identified only as LC, was sentenced to five years in jail in July 2010 – prompting Mrs May to make an order for his removal back to China. But he lodged a human rights appeal against his deportation on the grounds he had a wife and two young children – one of whom was born in 2011, while he was behind bars. Both the youngsters have British citizenship and lawyers argued they needed to be brought up by both parents in the UK. Immigration judges originally found in favour of the migrant, who first entered the UK claiming asylum in 2002 and met his Chinese-born wife here. But, in a hugely significant ruling, the Court of Appeal has decided the public interest in seeing the Chinese man returned to his own country ‘outweighs’ the human rights of the criminal’s children. Lord Justice Moore-Bick, vice-president of the civil section of the Court of Appeal, said the man’s children – a son aged six and daughter aged three – were not required to leave Britain and could be cared for by their mother, who is claiming benefits. He added: ‘If he is deported, it will be for him and his partner to decide whether it is in the children’s best interests to remain here with her or move to China as part of a united family. ‘Neither the fact that his children enjoy British nationality nor the fact that they may be separated from their father for a long time will be sufficient to constitute exceptional circumstances of a kind which outweigh the public interest in his deportation.’ LC could potentially lodge an appeal to the Supreme Court or European Court in Strasbourg, though lawyers would face an uphill task persuading either to hear the case, given the firmness of the Appeal Court’s judgment. It is understood he is currently on immigration bail. Scroll down for video . The ruling was made at the Court of Appeal in the Royal Courts of Justice in London's Strand (pictured) today . Last night Mrs May said: ‘I welcome this judgment, which sends out a clear message to foreign nationals who break the law that they face deportation and can no longer exploit the system to stay in the UK. ‘The new Immigration Act will make it even harder for foreign criminals to launch spurious appeals to stay in the country. It will also allow a deport-first, appeal-later approach for some foreign criminals making Article 8 claims.’ Tory MP Dominic Raab, who has campaigned to end the abuse of human rights law, added: ‘This is a welcome ruling – some long-awaited common sense on the application of Article 8. ‘But one swallow doesn’t make a summer – we need to see the whole approach to deportation re-oriented to put public protection first.’ A foreign national can face deportation from the UK under three circumstances laid out by the Home Office. These are: . • Where the Secretary of State deems the person's deportation to be conducive to the public good . • Where the person is the spouse or civil partner or child under 18 of a person ordered to be deported . • Where a court recommends deportation in the case of a person over the age of 17 who has been convicted of an offence punishable with imprisonment . The decision can however be appealed against if the order is interferes with Article 8 of the European  Convention on Human Rights - the right to respect for private and family life. Under Article 8, 'everyone' has the right to respect for his private and family life, his home and his correspondence. This cannot be interfered with by a public authority except if done so legally and deemed necessary in the interests of national security, public safety, the economic well being of the country, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others. In some cases a judge can order that the family of a foreign national ordered to be deported are also sent out of the country. A spouse or civil partner will not normally be deported if they have qualified for settlement in his own right or has been living apart from the deportee. The child of a deportee will not normally be deported if they live with their other parent his mother or father are living apart from the deportee, they have left home and become independent, or they are married before deportation comes into prospect. The Court of Appeal ruling follows a string of shocking examples of foreign criminals thwarting deportation on the grounds they have children living in the UK. The most notorious case is that of Aso Mohammed Ibrahim, who left 12-year-old Amy Houston to die ‘like a dog’ under the wheels of his car after knocking her down in 2003 while disqualified from driving. Earlier this month, the Tories unveiled plans to scrap the Human Rights Act and replace it with a British Bill of Rights. Justice Secretary Chris Grayling said one of the main aims was to make it easier to deport foreign criminals. How May trumped the soft judiciary . James Slack's Analysis . It is the first case to come to light since Theresa May changed the law earlier this year to state that Article 8 should apply only in the most ‘exceptional cases’ For years foreign criminals have thwarted authorities trying to deport them by claiming they have children in the UK who deserve the right to a ‘family life’. In some cases, judges even accepted this argument when there was no evidence a convict was still in touch with their son or daughter. In 2012, exasperated at the abuse of Article 8 of Labour’s Human Rights Act, Theresa May issued new guidance to judges, saying serious foreign criminals should normally be kicked out. The judges largely ignored her – saying it was only guidance, and they would continue to take their lead from the Act. The Home Secretary’s response was to change the law, forcing the courts to respect the wishes of Parliament. The Immigration Act received Royal assent in May. The rules state that, if a foreign criminal has been sentenced to less than four years in jail, they should be removed unless there are ‘exceptional’ family reasons not to do so. To satisfy this test, they must have a child who is a British citizen who, if their parent was deported, would have nobody else who could care for them in the UK. It must also be unreasonable to expect the child to leave the county. In cases such as LC, who was sentenced to more than four years, the rules become stricter. The only way a convict can avoid removal is to show there were ‘exceptional circumstances justifying his remaining in the UK which outweigh the public interest in his removal’. LC failed on this count because of the severity of his crimes and the fact his British-born children have a mother who – while born in China herself – is free to continue living here. The judges found that the fact LC might not see his children for a decade or more was tough luck. As Tory MP Dominic Raab shrewdly observes, one swallow does not a summer make. But ministers will hope that – finally – judges have got the message that Article 8 should not be cited as a bar to removal. The key test will come next year, when we learn just how many criminals cheated deportation in 2014. In 2013, before the new legislation was passed, the number rocketed by 50 per cent. In total, only 1,310 of the 4,030 overseas convicts who were considered for removal were sent home. The offenders who weren’t thrown out included 15 murderers, five people guilty of manslaughter and 15 rapists.","Chinese national was convicted of robbing two young women in their flat .

An earlier version of this article said that this is the first case to come to light since Theresa May changed the law earlier this year to state that Article 8 should apply only in the most ‘exceptional cases’.

"He may have shelled out £1.4million on a Hollywood Hills mansion. But self-styled revolutionary Russell Brand decided he was the right man to lead a protest against inflated house prices in a fashionable area of London which he frequents. Dressed as a street urchin, the comedian led his first action against Britain's richest MP Richard Benyon and his brother Edward after their family firm bought a housing estate and inflated the rent. Russell Brand led the first stage of his revolution against the family firm owned by MP Richard Benyon and his brother Edward . More than 90 households within The New Era Estate in Hoxton, East London, fear the plan to charge 'market rents' will treble their bills. The star, who is worth £9million, invited people to join him for a day of 'Dickensian fun' to protest against the 'three Scrooges' - Boris Johnson and the Benyon brothers. He was seen attaching a fake eviction notice to a  Benyon Estate property and hanging a banner which said 'social housing not social cleansing' to the scaffolding. 'As you know property developers – in partnership with corrupt, inept or lazy politicians – have created a housing crisis for ordinary people all over the world,' he said on his website.

'I bet your rent is soaring; I bet you are finding it hard to pay. It's especially bad in cities, and for this first action we want to focus on London. 'In Hoxton, East London there is a diabolical situation that we need your help with. The New Era estate provided affordable homes for ordinary working families (they ain't that ordinary I hang out with em – some of em are right weirdos). 'Then unfortunately (and I'm partly to blame by moving in and being so cool) Hoxton became 'trendy'. 'That's when the old Etonian Edward Benyon (brother of richest Tory MP in Britain Richard Benyon), along with billion dollar American property firm Westbrook, purchased the property. 'They backtracked on the deal to keep the estate as affordable housing.' At least 100 people turned up to the first stage of his revolution, which had a heavy police presence.

At least 100 people turned up to the first stage of his revolution, many dressed as street urchins . But the sales figures may further fuel his reputation as 'a champagne socialist' - after he ducked out of left-wing demonstrations in London to head to an exclusive celebrity-packed West End party. Two days before the 'peaceful' protest, he wrote on his website: 'Dress up as a pauper or an urchin – pretty soon you’ll have no choice if they get their way – and support The New Era residents whose demands are simple – to stay in the homes they’ve worked to make their own at the rent that was agreed. 'I’ll be there – I’m either going as Fagin or Elephant Man – I know he wasn’t a Dickens character, he was a real bloke, but he was Victorian and he was exploited.' The tables were turned on Russell Brand earlier this week after Twitter users started using a Blur song  to mock him on the internet. Whenever the outspoken 39-year-old posted messages online in recent days his remarks have been met with the response 'Parklife' - the name of one of band's best known hits. This is because Twitter user Dan Barker posted a line from the comedian's book and remarked that his writing 'feels like someone is about to shout ""PARKLIFE!"" at the end of every sentence'.

"Stuart Delaney  tried to disguise himself with a hoodie while raiding a bookmakers - only to reveal his face to the CCTV camera . A bungling robber was caught after trying to disguise himself with a hoodie while raiding a bookmakers - only to reveal his face to the CCTV camera. Stuart Delaney, 29, also hurled a brick at the security screen in front of the cashier's desk at Ladbrokes in Stechford, Birmingham - only for it to bounce off. The criminal then tried to steal a charity box from behind the counter of the branch - but left it because it was too big to fit under the metal tray. Even his own defence lawyer said that the raid was a 'total failure', describing the would-be thief as 'clumsy' and 'bizarre'. Just hours before raiding the bookies on June 22, he had broken into a house nearby and stolen £2,000 worth of valuables. Delaney has been jailed for three years and eight months after he admitted burglary and attempted robbery at Birmingham Crown Court. The court heard the 'bizarre' raid took place while other gamblers carried on playing the fruit machines. His face can clearly be seen on the security camera footage - even though he tried to hide his identity with a hooded top. Prosecutor Fiona Contese said: 'The cashier did not say anything and the defendant then approached the door that led to the staff side of the counter and threw a brick which bounced off.' Delaney, of Sheldon, Birmingham. threw the brick again, forcing the cashier to duck, before he tried to grab the charity box. Earlier the thief had ransacked a property and vandalised the outside with spray paint. He was caught after he left fingerprints on the paint he used and left near the house. The former kitchen assembler handed himself in shortly after the botched bookmakers raid. John Smitheman, defending, said Delaney had begun drinking heavily after he split with his girlfriend and lost his job shortly before his bungled raid.

"David Cameron has clashed with Russian President Vladimir Putin in diplomatic talks in Milan today over the continuing crisis in Ukraine. The Prime Minister said Russia must denounce unofficial elections in rebel-held areas of Ukraine, which are propped up by the Kremlin, if it is to stand any chance of seeing EU sanctions eased. But Mr Putin failed to offer any assurance on the issue during talks with European leaders and Ukraine's President Petro Poroshenko in a fresh push to end the conflict. David Cameron (left), French President Francois Hollande (centre) and Russian leader Vladimir Putin (right) held talks in Milan today . Downing Street sources described the exchanges with EU leaders and Mr Poroshenko - in the margins of today's summit in Milan - as 'frank'. Mr Putin declared his intent to avoid a 'frozen conflict' in the region, they said, but had been pressed repeatedly to offer concrete examples of what the Kremlin was prepared to do. The Kremlin said the talks had been 'difficult and full of misunderstanding and disagreements'. A ceasefire deal was signed in Minsk in September but more than 300 people have since been killed in continued clashes with pro-Russian separatists in the east of the country. Moscow denies arming the rebel forces but the EU and US have imposed economic sanctions in response to the annexation of Crimea and what they see as continued support for separatists. 'Vladimir Putin said very clearly that he doesn't want a frozen conflict, he doesn't want a divided Ukraine,' Mr Cameron said after the talks ahead of the Asia Europe Meeting. The Prime Minister held 'frank' talks with his Russian counterpart in talks over the crisis in Ukraine . David Cameron arrived at the Asia-Europe summit in Milan, northern Italy, today amid continuing bloody skirmishes in Eastern Ukraine . Vladimir Putin gets into a car as he leaves the Asia-Europe Meeting, brings together 53 countries - representing more than half the world's gross domestic product and over 60 per cent of the global population . 'But if that is the case then Russia needs to take the action to put in place all that has been agreed - getting Russian troops out of Ukraine, getting heavy weapons out of Ukraine, respecting all the agreements and only recognising one legitimate set of Ukrainian elections,' he told reporters. 'If those things don't happen then the European Union, Britain included, must keep in place the sanctions and the pressure so that we don't have this kind of conflict in our continent.' French President Francois Hollande, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi, European Commission president Jose Manuel Barroso and European Council president Herman van Rompuy were part of the latest peace push - which also focused on a gas dispute which has raised fears of energy supplies to Europe being affected. Further talks between officials will take place later today in a bid to thrash out formal agreements. Official parliamentary elections have been called for October 26, with local polls - including in disputed areas - for December 7, but rebels have declared their own vote on November 2. A Downing Street source said: 'It was a pretty frank meeting. On the one hand there are signs that Putin doesn't want a frozen conflict, but I think we remain cautious that we see that progress on the ground.' Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and British Prime Minister David Cameron held talks on the sidelines of the summit in Milan . Mr Putin 'wouldn't commit' to denouncing the rival polls. 'Clearly those are not the ones agreed by the Ukrainian government; they are therefore not in line with Ukrainian law and we all need to be clear that we'll denounce them and won't recognise them.' Before leaving Italy, Mr Cameron had face-to-face talks with President Nursultan Nazarbayev, of Kazakhstan, about the latest situation. He also met his newly-elected Polish and Swedish counterparts, Ewa Kopacz and Stephan Lofven.More than 3,600 people have died in eastern Ukraine since fighting broke out in mid-April when armed separatists declared they were setting up their own state. Although Putin announced this week that Russian troops near the border with Ukraine would be pulled back, Western officials want to see clear evidence that Moscow is acting on this. 'Vladimir Putin said very clearly he doesn't want a frozen conflict and doesn't want a divided Ukraine. But if that's the case, then Russia now needs to take the actions to put in place all that has been agreed,' said British Prime Minister David Cameron. 'If those things don't happen, then clearly the European Union, Britain included, must keep in place the sanctions and the pressure so we don't have this sort of conflict in our continent.'","PM said Russia must denounce unofficial elections in rebel-held areas .

"Despite attempts from the Government to crack down on the industry, street monkey shows remain a popular form of entertainment in Indonesia. The performances- known locally as 'topeng monyet'- involve the monkeys wearing little jumpsuits and mimicking human activities like riding bicycles or walking on stilts. Animal rights groups have long campaigned for a ban on the shows, which they claim are cruel and exploitative. The shows are also believed to be a health risk as the monkeys have been known to carry diseases including tuberculosis, hepatitis and the bacterial disease, leptospirosis. The performances involve macaques being dressed in human attire and imitating human activities activities like riding motorbikes . Animal rights groups have long campaigned for a ban on the shows, which they claim are cruel and exploitative . The governor of Jakarta, Joko Widodo, ordered all roadside monkey performances in Jakarta to be banned in Jakarta last year, but they remain popular in other parts of the country . The governor of Jakarta, Joko Widodo, ordered all roadside monkey performances in Jakarta to be banned last year. The city government announced it would buy back all monkeys used as street buskers for  $90AUD and shelter them at a preserve at Jakarta's Ragunan Zoo. They also arranged for caretakers of the monkeys to be provided vocational training to help find new jobs. Outside of Jakarta, the performances remain a popular activity, and for some, even a means of livelihood. Yuli Seperi is photographer based in Bintan, Riau, Suamtera, Indonesia. He documents local street monkey performances. 'Performing monkeys on the streets has been a regular in various regions of Indonesia. It's entertaining for the audience,' he said. Seperi said he sympathises with the animal rights groups who campaign against the shows. 'Performing like this does seem cruel and exploitative. But I think some people have grown to rely on the shows to earn their living expenses. These are people who have little means of earning an income.' Yelki said performing monkeys can generate Rp 50,000 or US $5AUD each performance. With about six performances being standard in a day, one monkey can earn around $30AUD a day. He said he was not aware of the health risks associated with the shows. 'In my opinion, this show will not cause illness to the audience. I have never heard about this.' Yelki said performing monkeys can generate Rp 50,000 or US $5AUD each performance, and up to $30AUD a day .

"Google's inbox shows live alerts and updates . Google has launched an new email . service it hopes will help people organise their lives. Called 'Inbox', it mixes traditional email with live alerts for appointments, flight . bookings and package deliveries. Google said the service was designed to deal with the way email has changed. 'Email started simply as a way to send digital notes around the office,' said Google's Sundar Pichai. 'But fast-forward 30 years and with just the phone in your pocket, you can use email to contact virtually anyone in the world…from your best friend to the owner of that bagel shop you discovered last week.' The new Inbox will address the rpboem of getting too much email. 'With this evolution comes new challenges: we get more email now than ever, important information is buried inside messages, and our most important tasks can slip through the cracks—especially when we’re working on our phones. 'For many of us, dealing with email has become a daily chore that distracts from what we really need to do—rather than helping us get those things done.' For now the new service is being provided alongside Gmail, . which was launched in 2004. It will be available on the Web as . well as on Android smartphones and iPhones. Google said it was sending out invitations to selected Gmailusers to try out the new service. Users can also email the . company at inbox@google.com to get an invitation. 'Inbox is by the same people who brought you Gmail, but it's . not Gmail: it's a completely different type of inbox, designed . to focus on what really matters,' the company said in a blog . post. Google said Inbox displays real-time updates to emails - for . example, showing the delivery status of items bought online. Inbox highlights the key information from important messages, such as flight itineraries, event information, and photos and documents emailed to you by friends and family. It will even display useful information from the web that wasn’t in the original email, such as the real-time status of your flights and package deliveries. It lets you add your own Reminders, from picking up the dry cleaning to giving your parents a call and can show the relevant numbers alongside tasks. It also shows reminders in a more accessible way that allows . users to more easily keep track of chores and appointments. The company said the new application also enhances features . that are already available in Gmail that allow users to view . purchases and bank account statements grouped together.

"When it comes to the cinema sensation Gone Girl, it appears that most of us fall into one of two camps – those who have seen it, and those who are about to see it. The thriller, which topped the UK film charts, taking £4.1million in its opening weekend, is the story of an unhappily married woman who goes missing – leaving her husband accused of murder. At its heart is British beauty Rosamund Pike, 35, who plays Amy, the wife of Nick Dunne, portrayed by US star Ben Affleck, 41. Scroll down for video . Gone Girl star Rosamund Pike, 35, said people have ridiculous expectations of their spouses nowadays . Even though she is not married herself, Miss Pike has revealed forthright views on matrimony during interviews about the movie. The actress, who is expecting her second child with partner Robie Uniacke, said we demand too much of our spouses nowadays, telling Spectrum magazine: 'People have ridiculous expectations of a mate. 'In my grandmother's day, you wouldn't expect your husband to fulfil the same need in you as your sister, or girlfriends, or colleagues at work. You'd have different needs met by different people. 'Now we want all our needs met by one person, and I don't believe that's possible. Or rather, it is, but I don't think it's universally achievable. British beauty  plays Amy, the wife of Nick Dunne, portrayed by US star Ben Affleck, 41, in Gone Girl . 'I do think separation is key to a relationship. I go out with my partner and we are put next to each other – there's a feeling of, 'What, you don't think we can't operate without each other?' I don't need him as a crutch. Of course, he's the person I want to go home with but he's not necessarily the person I want to sit next to. I'd rather meet someone new, and he would too.' The success of the film – directed by David Fincher – puts it on course to become one of the biggest earners this year, and has catapulted Miss Pike to global fame. On Monday, it was one of the most talked-about topics on Twitter. Speaking of the difficulty of rehearsing sex scenes with on-screen lover Neil Patrick Harris, 41, she told Glamour magazine: 'It was very funny. David left Neil and me alone for two hours to make sure we could do it. But when it's just two of you on a bed, it feels so inappropriate.' Prior to meeting Robin, Rosamund was engaged to Pride & Prejudice director Joe Wright, but they split in 2008 when he called off their wedding plans. In an interview soon after, she said: 'I still have no idea why Joe called off the wedding. He was never clear about it. Part of what makes it so confusing. 'I still think he's an extraordinary man, I really do.'","Rosamund Pike, 35, said we demand too much of our spouses nowadays .

"This brazen picture shows fraudster Nicholas Wayne Lowe relaxing on a sun lounger catching some rays holding up a wad of 500 Thai Baht bills to the camera. The snap, released by the South Australia Court Registry, reveals an insight into the sort of lifestyle the former public servant was living before he was caught stealing $1.135 million from the Victims of Crime Fund. At the latest court hearing on Wednesday Lowe, who headed up an embezzlement ring that swiped the cash  over a period of four years, was told by Judge Paul Muscat at the District Court that he will be swapping the silver service he was used to for plastic service, reports The Advertiser. Nicholas Wayne Lowe is seen here pictured holding a huge wad of cash while on holiday in Thailand . The judge added: 'They enjoyed themselves at the expense of the Victims of Crime fund ... there’s simply nothing (here) but sheer greed, luxury and excess.” The court heard how a junior Crown Solicitor’s Office clerk discovered the conspiracy Lowe's wife Andrea, a former employee of MP Jennifer Rankine’s, deleted an incriminating email chain. She has pleaded guilty to one count of impeding an investigation and was due to be sentenced today. Lowe, 31, stole the cash between October 2008 and August 2012 and employed his family and friends in the lucrative scheme. Lowe appeared at Adelaide District Court yesterday and was told he would be sentenced by December 5 . The former clerk in the Crown Solicitor's Office pleaded guilty on May last year to 26 aggravated counts of dishonestly dealing with documents. In the four years he personally pocketed $491,200 share of the $1.135 million illicitly obtained by the fraud group, reports The Advertiser. The court heard how the other men involved in the fraud racket were Lowe's family and friends who he asked 'want to make some money?' and said all he needed to use was their names to make the false claims. Lowe worked at the Crown Solicitor's Office in Adelaide when he committed the crimes between 2008 and 2012 . The other defendants- James Peter Moore, Steven and Travis Langston, Kane Peter Dominey, Andrew John Soliatis and Daniel Stephen Almstetter- each pleaded guilty to one or more counts of the same offence, reports The Advertiser. After the false claims were made Lowe would then approve and issue to them and when they were cashed half was given back to Lowe. Judge Muscat gave Soliatis, Almstetter, Moore and Steven Langston suspended jail sentences on the condition of good behaviour at Wednesday's hearing. Dominey and Travis Langston were also bailed to be sentenced in two weeks on November 19 . Lowe was remanded in custody until December 5.","Nicholas Wayne Lowe is seen posing with a huge wad of cash on holiday in a picture released by the South Australia Court Registry .

"Britain's most pernicious invasive plant, Japanese knotweed, may have finally met its match in a two millimetre-long insect . It has plagued gardeners for decades and affected thousands of house sales because of its ability to grow more than 9ft in just ten weeks. But Britain's most pernicious invasive plant, Japanese knotweed, may have finally met its match in a two millimetre-long insect. Research on Aphalara itadori, a psyllid or plant louse similar to aphids, has established that it inhibits the growth of the knotweed and poses no risk to native species, including the plant's close relative rhubarb. Scientists at CABI, formerly Commonwealth Agricultural Bureaux International, announced that they have also succeeded in getting the insect to survive through British winters. Dr Kate Constantine, from CABI, said: 'The results confirmed the psyllid to be a high-specialised natural enemy of Japanese knotweed. The challenge now is to get the psyllid to establish in the natural environment which, as for any programme of this type, isn't easy.' Tens of thousands of specially bred lice were placed on knotweed at eight locations in England and Wales as part of the research. This was the first time the release of an alien insect species had been authorised in the European Union. The study found the insect would feed on the sap of the knotweed, inhibiting its growth - but it failed to breed on any of 90 other native British species, meaning that they would face no threat from the insect. Scientists say the number of colonies that have successfully over-wintered remains too small to be certain that the bug could widely establish itself in Britain. But if it does, they believe the bug will allow natural order to slowly reassert itself and knotweed could eventually be seen as just a 'mild nuisance'. Writing in The Ecologist, Dr  Constantine said: 'A more natural equilibrium is restored. Biological control doesn't aim to eradicate the target plant, but rather to reduce its vigour and invasiveness. Keeping the invasive plant in check ideally allows native plants to re-establish and flourish.' Scroll down for video . Research on Aphalara itadori, a psyllid or plant louse similar to aphids, has established that it inhibits the growth of Japanese knotweed . Elizabeth Abraham's house lost half its value because Japanese knotweed started taking over the back garden . The Government last year faced calls to do more to tackle the invader following reports that banks were refusing to offer mortgages on properties affected by knotweed. Homeowners faced bills of up to £20,000 to remove the prolific foreign invader before they could sell. Earlier this year, Elizabeth Abraham's house lost  half its value because Japanese knotweed started taking over the back garden. The 91-year-old was told the house in Swansea, which was expected to be valued at £80,000, will not sell for more than £45,000 because of the untamed wild weed. The destructive bamboo-like plant has flourished across the country and the Government estimates it would take £1.5billion to clear the infestation. It can grow more than 9ft in just ten weeks, and easily spreads from neighbouring homes, wasteland, waterways, railway lines or footpaths. Its extensive deep roots can penetrate roads, concrete, damage foundations and drains. Japanese knotweed - which has the scientific name fallopia japonica - was introduced into Britain by the Victorians. Incredibly invasive, it can grow four inches (ten centimetres) in a day from April to October and a tiny root can establish itself as a plant in just ten days. Apparently solid structures such as tarmac and flooring in houses are no barrier to its growth and the weed also creates a risk of flooding if leaves clog waterways. Knotweed is recognised by its shovel-shaped leaves, bamboo-like stem and white flowers produced in autumn.","Scientists have found an insect which inhibits growth of Japanese knotweed .

"Charged: Paul Hewitt, pictured leaving Exeter Magistrates' Court today, is one of seven managers and 15 other care home staff accused of ill-treating residents . Twenty two members of staff at three care homes have appeared in court accused of abusing vulnerable residents and keeping them prisoner. Seven senior managers and 15 workers face a total of 86 charges - 11 counts of ill-treating patients and 75 counts of false imprisonment. The offences are alleged to have taken place at the Veilstone, Gatooma and Teignmead homes in Devon, run by Atlas Project Ltd. All the homes were shut down in 2012 and the residents moved elsewhere. The charges say seven victims were 'unlawfully and injuriously imprisoned' and detained against their will on 68 separate occasions. Three victims are said to have been ill-treated by staff on five occasions while being treated 'for mental disorder as an in-patient'. Exeter Magistrates' Court heard the alleged abuse occurred at the care homes, in north and south Devon, between December 31 2009 and January 1 2012. All three homes, which cared for adults with learning disabilities, were closed in 2012 following inspections by the Care Quality Commission. Two more workers have been summonsed to appear at the court next week to answer eight charges of false imprisonment and one of ill-treating a patient. District Judge Stephen Nicholls committed the case to Exeter Crown Court where the defendants will next appear on November 21. Speaking after the hearing, Detective Inspector Steve White, of Devon and Cornwall Police, said: 'This case is unique in terms of the number of suspects, the complex needs of the victims and the volume of investigation material. 'It has and continues to involve many partners and agencies and we will continue to work together to support those affected as the judicial process continues.' The defendants are all former employees and worked at Gatooma, in Holsworthy, Teignmead, in Teignbridge, and Veilstone, near Bideford. Case: Jolyon Marshall (left) and his wife Rachel are also managers accused of offences related to three care homes in Devon . Case: Camilla Cameron, Christine Kent, Lisa Pluckrose and Lee Farrant (top left to bottom right) are among 15 other staff accused of poor care . Seven defendants, described as 'senior managers' by police, were arrested and charged with separate offences of false imprisonment and ill-treating patients. They are: Victoria Cobbett, 25, of  Bideford; Paul Hewitt, 68, of  Teignmouth; Russell Hewitt, 40, of Teignmouth; Jolyon Marshall, 39, of South Molton; Rachel Marshall, 29, of  South Molton; Timothy Stevens, 43, of Bideford; and Emma Turner, 27, of Teignmouth. It is alleged that the seven, who were all released on conditional bail, conspired together to commit the offences between 2009 and 2012. Fifteen members of staff appeared before the same court to answer summonses for offences of false imprisonment. Four of them also face a charge of ill-treating a patient. Case: Sarah Eke (right holding the hand of an unknown man) is accused of false imprisonment .

"A herd of elephants slap a layer of thick mud and dust over their skin - in the same way as we apply sun block. And with the baking hot African sun baring down on them, and a lack of rainfall, these elephants at the Etosha National Park in Namibia wasted no time in covering themselves up. The 'dust bath' is part of a daily routine that elephants practice after a morning bathe. The thick mud layer helps keep their body temperature down and acts as a parasite deterrent. An elephant tosses a trunk full of dirt onto its head, to help cool off under the baking hot African sun . The 'dust bath' is part of a daily routine that elephants practice after a morning bathe . A cloud of dust forms around the elephant, as it uses its trunk to scoop of the rain-deprived soil . Photographer Peter Delaney found the elephants leaving a nearby waterhole and then captured them applying their all-natural sunblock. Mr Delaney, from Avoca in County Wicklow, Ireland, followed the elephants after they had spent the morning bathing and drinking at a waterhole. The 47-year-old wanted to 'create images that are unique and captures the essence of my subject'. And it was a 'frustrating week', waiting for the perfect opportunity to capture the iconic animals. Photographer Peter Delaney tracked the elephants, after they spent the morning bathing at a waterhole . He said: 'But on my last day all the elements needed for these images came together. 'The image where the four metre tall, four ton heavy elephant raised his trunk filled with the red Kalahari dust and in one fluid movement sprayed his forehead is my favourite.' The grassland dominates the national park where elephants roam along with ostriches, giraffes, antelope and lions. Normally a slight red in colour, the pale yellow grass indicates just how parched the soil is outside of the seasonal rain.","Mud helps elephants keep cool and acts as a parasite deterrent .

"This is the moment a weatherman was left with a sore arm after wrestling with a playful dog live on air during his morning broadcast. Mike Sobel, a weatherman in Edmonton, Canada, was game for a laugh when he decided to do his broadcast with Ripple the dog who made the phrase 'never work with kids or animals' ring true. It starts off tamely enough, as Ripple, an 18-month-old mastiff mix appears alongside him on Global Edmonton. But it soon descends into chaos. Scroll down for video . Calm before the storm: Mike Sobel, a weatherman in Edmonton, Canada, introduces Ripple, the dog . I want to break free: Ripple appears to have his own plan regarding how the broadcast will go . The dog was making the appearance on the TV news show to promote animal adoption, but instead ended up highlighting why so many people love their playful pets. Sobel said: 'This is going to be a challenge.' He then calmly introduces Ripple to viewers and says the dog is just a year-and-a-half old and wants to play. 'Sit ripple, sit, Ripple! Sit, sit, no, Ripple's not sitting that's for sure,' he said. He then valiantly  tells viewers that the temperature is currently three degrees, as the dog tugs at his leash, appearing to want to bite through it. Extreme conditions: For a few seconds, Sobel tries, in vain, to get through the rest of his report . Tugged: But Ripple has already decided to tug him to the right of the screen during the hilarious broadcast . Biting: He battles, in vain, to calm Ripple down as the dog bites through his red leash live on air . Sobel said jokingly: 'Ripple wants to play, right Ripple?' He then  wraps the dog leash around his hand and tells viewers  about cold spots in Barrhead, as he clutches the bright red leash in his left hand. For a few seconds, he tries, in vain, to get through the rest of his report, and at one point, he looks down a Ripple and asks him 'are you having fun there?' Suddenly Ripple decides that this is his chance to wriggle free of the weatherman. He begins frantically twisting and turning, forcing Sobel to turn as well. Viewers watch as the dog yanks Sobel so hard that the weatherman is forced to laugh loudly as he tries to give the weather forecast alongside the dog. But the Canadian broadcaster is such a professional that he never once stopped giving his report. Rough conditions: As Sobel attempts to give the next seven days' forecast things get blustery in the studio . Forecast: The broadcast ends with the dog jumping up on him and pushing him backwards . He shouts: 'No' in between fits of giggles to Ripple the dog. However, Ripple, still baring his teeth, and trying to chew through his leash isn't having any of it. Finally, the weatherman says 'alright, alright, alright' as he tries to calm Ripple down. He then talks to someone off camera saying: 'Okay, you're going to be able to hold him better?' Sobel then goes back to his weather forecast to talk about calm conditions at Grand Prairie, despite there being rather turbulent conditions in the studio. As he gets to the 7 day forecast he jokes: 'Okay we've got to move quickly through this!' as the dog continues to struggle to break free. Suddenly, Sobel realizes that the dog has actually managed to chew right through his leash, leaving the weatherman with just the end of it wrapped around his hands. He looks down in shock and then admits defeat as the entire studio crew bursts into laughter. 'He broke it,' he laughs, 'alright you're on your own' he tells the dog shooing him away. 'Here, do you want to play with this?' he adds holding up the leash to the dog. Ripple decides this is the perfect opportunity to jump up and push Sobel several times as the weatherman, simultaneously tries to do the weather report and wrestle, unsuccessfully, with the dog. The broadcast ends with the dog jumping up on him and pushing him backwards. Both the weatherman and dog are thought to be fine.","Mike Sobel, a weatherman in Edmonton, Canada, was game for a laugh .

"Christine Cheung wonders if there will be a day where she could go about her life without being asked if Lucas is her real son. She had her husband Aaron, who are both of Asian descent, welcomed their first child two years ago but were shocked to find that he had a rare medical condition - one that is believed to have only struck two families in Australia. The main symptoms being that Lucas had intractable diarrhoea, an immune deficiency and blonde hair. But the Cheungs - who live in Riverview in Sydney's north shore -  say they are approached by strangers at least three times a day, intrigued to learn about Lucas' biological history. On many occasions, Mrs Cheung says has been left frustrated and angered by questions which imply her son does not belong to her. Christine Cheung with her two-year-old son Lucas who has tricho hepato enteric syndrome which includes symptoms such as blonde hair . It took doctors one and a half years after Lucas was born that doctors were able to diagnose him with the rare medical condition . 'It took us a year and a half to find out what medical condition Lucas had and the doctors had never heard of such a case,' Mrs Cheung told Daily Mail Australia. Lucas has tricho hepato enteric syndrome - a disorder which has only ever been reported 44 times worldwide. Needless to say, it was an arduous time for the first-time parents as Mr and Mrs Cheung were desperate for some kind of diagnosis for their son who was born prematurely at 32 weeks. 'We had to go through test after test which kept coming back negative so we were pretty much living in the hospital for a year and a half,' Mrs Cheung said. 'It was painful but in the end we were so happy to finally get an answer.' However the Cheungs were faced with the reality that there was limited information and research surrounding the uncommon illness. There are reportedly only two families in Australia, seven around the world, who have tricho hepato enteric syndrome. 'We actually went and visited the one other family in Australia who have a child with the same condition as Lucas,' she said. 'We're lucky in a way to know that there's another family in Australia who's going through the same thing as us. 'From what we know, and with the minimal information that we have, we're the first Asian family in Australia to have the syndrome so far.' Little Lucas was born prematurely at 32 weeks and had to be kept in hospital for a year and a half . Due to Lucas' rare disorder, he was unable to digest anything as he had intractable diarrhoea . Mrs Cheung says her son's symptoms are now manageable and he's becoming more healthy each day . While Mrs Cheung, 32, tends to her child's medical needs as he has trouble digesting food, she also has to deal with the multiple questions and assumptions made about why her son naturally has platinum blonde hair. 'Nobody knows about his condition because there's not much research about it,' she said. 'Lucas' symptoms are now manageable but he used to get diarrhoea about 30 to 45 times a day.' So her annoyance is understandable when she is constantly questioned by strangers, who most which are quite presumptuous and rude. 'It depends how I'm approached but unfortunately most of the time I get asked ""was he born like that?"" or ""why is he blonde"" and they're all asked in a judgemental tone so that's why I react in a negative way,' she said. 'It's as if they're asking me whether he's been adopted. Actually, I was even asked by this one woman: ""is he your real son?"".' 'I feel that when I'm asked in a rude way that the information is really none of their business and I'm seriously so sick of the questions.' (From left) Husband Aaron Cheung, little Lucas and mum Christine Cheung . Mr Cheung, 34, spending some quality time with his first child Lucas . While Mrs Cheung recognises the natural curiosity of others, she wants people to think before they jump to conclusions. 'I'm not exaggerating when I say that I get asked minimum three times a day,' she said. 'But I get it, Lucas stands out. He has blonde hair and I've even given him a trendy haircut because I love his hair and want to make the most of it. 'I know where people are coming from but they should think before they ask such rude questions and if they were more polite about it then I'm happy to respond.' Yet in a more recent incident, Mrs Cheung was at a restaurant with her family when another diner interrupted her meal and questioned her about Lucas. 'She stopped eating and came straight up to our table and asked me: ""why is he blonde?"". She didn't even say hello or anything,' she said. 'If she had approached me in a more polite way I wouldn't have been so angry about it.' Ever since Lucas came into her life, Mrs Cheung's outlook on life has changed. 'I know that if I saw someone looking a little different on the street that I wouldn't go up and ask them about it - it's their life and it's personal,' she said. 'My dream goal is to help mums with sick kids or children with special needs because I've been through it all. 'Some people think we should appreciate it that we're being given special attention when all we really want is to be treated like any other person. 'I feel uncomfortable with that kind of attention and it can be quite frustrating at times.'","It took over a year for Christine and Aaron Cheung, of Sydney, to find out about their son's rare condition .

"Dressing up, posing for photo shoots and updating fans on your goings-on is something more commonly associated with celebrities. But that lifestyle is an every day reality for one popular pooch who just a year ago was rescued from a puppy farm. Cavalier spaniel Lucy - who has almost 3,000 Facebook followers - was named Britain's most heroic dog at the Birmingham NEC's National Pet Show in September. And to celebrate her title the seven-year-old is now set to star in her own calendar, which features the mutt in different outfits each month. Lucy the cavalier spaniel was named Britain's most heroic dog at the National Pet Show in Birmingham, presented by Ben Fogle . Lisa Garner (right) adopted Lucy, seven, in March 2013 after she was rescued from a puppy farm when she weighed just eight pounds . The 2015 calendar will hit the shops just in time for Christmas and show Lucy in a party hat celebrating her birthday month and sitting in a suitcase with a bucket and spade in the summer. Money raised will be split between PupAid, set up to highlight puppy farm cruelty, and Many Tears Animal Rescue. It is an organisation close to the heart of her owner, Lisa Garner from Studley, Warwickshire, after her pooch was rescued from squalor in March 2013. The 35-year-old, who runs a dog boutique, said: 'When I first saw Lucy, she was skin and bone and very withdrawn. She was absolutely tiny, weighing only eight pounds. 'Lucy didn't even resemble the breed. She had bald patches, stained feet from being kept on a urine-covered floor, and an arched back. 'When I first held her, it broke my heart because Lucy just wanted to get down and back into her bed. The pooch poses in a suitcase alongside a bucket and spade and sun cream for her new 2015 calendar, in shops before Christmas . The spaniel dressed as a teacher for the September page of her 2015 calendar, which celebrates her title awarded in September . Lucy celebrates her birthday month of March in this shot for the calendar, as she poses with a streamer in her mouth and wears a boa . Owner Lisa set up a Facebook page to raise awareness of puppy farming after she adopted Lucy in March 2013 and has been overwhelmed by the following they have recieved . 'She still has some health problems, but the transformation over 18 months has been amazing. 'She loves everyone she meets, which is surprising when you think what she's been through.' Since then, the hound has become an internet sensation,after her owner set up Facebook page 'Lucy The Rescue Cavalier' to raise awareness of puppy farming.

"There was a time when she held the nation – and Captain Ross Poldark – in the palm of her hand. Now, as the BBC revives the classic costume drama Poldark, here is the first look at the new Demelza. Eleanor Tomlinson – previously seen in the BBC’s The White Queen – is taking over the role of the fiery heroine first made famous by Angharad Rees. And these pictures show her on set last week in Corsham, Wiltshire, which is standing in for 18th Century Cornwall. HEROINE: Eleanor Tomlinson in the role of Demelza which Angharad Rees made famous . THEN AND NOW: The 1970s and 2015 incarnations of Ross Poldark and Demelza . The original series attracted audiences of up to 15 million when it ran from 1975 to 1977. And when the eight-part revival airs next year, it will be in a post-9pm watershed slot, so producers can make it steamier than before. Tomlinson, 22, said: ‘Demelza was so brilliantly played by Angharad, and I have done my best to try not to disappoint the army of Poldark fans.’ Ms Rees died of pancreatic cancer in 2012. In the revival, Ross Poldark, first played by Robin Ellis, will be played by Aidan Turner from The Hobbit movies.","Eleanor Tomlinson takes over the role made famous by Angharad Rees .

"Soothing blue lights will be installed in some rail stations in the hope it will stop the growing number of suicides. Network Rail is undertaking a series of trials, including the blue lights in canopies and lighting studs on platforms. It is also investigating the use of sensors which are triggered when people enter certain areas of the railway, such as the end of platforms, and then play a recorded announcement. Scroll down for video . Blue lights have already been installed in Gumyoji station, west of Tokyo, Japan. Network Rail will be trialling the lights to see if it has an impact on the number of suicides . There have been 279 suicides or suspected suicides on the rail network in 2013 to 2014, the highest number on record and up from 246 the previous year, according to official figures. 'We want to do everything we can to stop this from happening and, if it does, to help our people deal with it,' Ian Stevens, suicide prevention  manager for Network Rail, told the Sunday Times. Rail Safety and Standards Board revealed there were 29 suspected suicides in August and 28 during July. The monthly average over the past year has been 23. These figures come after an inquest last week heard how a troubled schoolgirl who threw herself in front of a train had been struggling to deal with the death of a former classmate who had killed herself in the same way. Mary Stroman, 16, had talked about Tallulah Wilson's suicide and her mother said the death had 'played on Mary's mind'. Mary Stroman, 16, (left) threw herself in front of a train after  struggling to deal with the death of former classmate Tallulah Wilson, 15, (right) who killed herself in the same way . The Samaritans have emphasised that the number of people who have killed themselves on the railways as a proportion of total suicides has increased. Railway suicides represented 4.7 per cent of total suicides in 2012, up from 3.2 per cent in 2003 and 4.6 per cent in 2006. The charity believes that financial pressures caused by the years of economic downturn may also have contributed. 'We have been coming out of a very big recession and the impact of the economic climate is very much being felt,' said Ola Rzepczynska, who has been heading a joint suicide prevention plan between the Samaritans and Network Rail. 'The real impacts are being felt in the most recent years.' About 200 railway staff, British Transport police officers and Samaritan volunteers will hold a one-day conference in Coventry on Thursday to discuss what more can be done to prevent railway suicides. Andrew Wellbeloved, 51, an operations manager for Network Rail, used his training two years ago when he was told that a man was standing on the tracks at a station in Cheshire. By the time Wellbeloved arrived the man had climbed back onto the platform, after an approaching train had stopped, but he remained highly distressed. 'I approached the man, who seemed to be confused and disorientated but [was] clearly in a state of despair,' Wellbeloved said. 'He told me he wanted to die. I told him that I had time to listen to him and asked him to come to my van with me. Thankfully, he agreed.' In a separate incident Wellbeloved, from Flintshire , had to comfort a train driver at the scene of a fatality. 'He just said, 'Twenty-six years and this has never happened to me. I'm devastated.' You could hear his voice was shaking, there were tears in his eyes.'

"AC Milan president Silvio Berlusconi has said he lost out at the World Cup because a £28million transfer involving Mario Balotelli and a Premier League club has stalled after Italy’s performances in Brazil. Italy crashed out at the group stages after failing to beat Uruguay and Costa Rica, and Berlusconi believes Balotelli’s disappointing performances in those games have scuppered his plans to get rid of the unpredictable 23-year-old. One person who will no doubt that Balotelli is staying in Milan is his girlfriend Fanny Neguesha who was seen enjoying a spot of shopping in the Italian city. But Berlusconi is far from amused, he said: ‘Other than Italy, I’m the one who lost at the World Cup,’ he is reported to have said during a meeting of his political party Forza Italia in Rome.

"They call Pele the greatest of all time and most of the world agrees. Many here in Brazil call Garrincha even greater that Pele because he played football with the rhythmic soul of the samba nation and personified the spirit of the beautiful game. They call Ronaldo the Phenomenon because how he ever came back on crippled legs to win one of their five World Cups so far and thus become the leading goalscorer in the history of the these Finals defies mortal rationalisation. Samba magic: Neymar has scored four goals at this World Cup to fire Brazil into the last 16 . Finisher: Following his double against Cameroon, Neymar has 37 goals in 53 internationals for Brazil . VIDEO Neymar better than Pele . Age: 22 (D.O.B. 05/02/1992) Born: Mogi das Cruzes, Brazil . Position: Forward . Clubs: Santos (2009-13), Barcelona (2013-) International debut: August 10, 2010 vs USA . International caps: 53 . First international goal: August 10, 2010 vs USA . International goals: 37 . They don’t know what to call Neymar. Not yet. But what they do suspect is that they may, just may, have found Brazil’s successor to the legend of Edson Arantes do Nascimento. If Neymar da Silva Santos Junior is the next Pele then we are watching it happen at this World Cup. What makes this all the more possible – not to mention so thrilling that we hardly dare believe it – is that this young man refuses to countenance any such comparison. ‘Pele is a god,’ he says. ‘I’m a footballer.’ You have to love a boy - he is still only 22 - who insists on having Neymar Jr inscribed on the back of that imperishable yellow shirt in reverence of his father. No that his football playing dad ever scored a goal of genius like the first of the two he put past Cameroon to ensure that the host nation dazzle on to the last 16 of the first World Cup played in this spiritual home of the beautiful game since 1950. But it speaks of respect. Looking up: Arguably only Pele and Garrincha now stand ahead of Neymar in the list of Brazilian greats . Poise: Neymar readies himself to score Brazil's opening goal against Cameroon in their 4-1 World Cup victory . 1) Pele - 77 goals (92 caps) 2) Zico - 66 goals (88 caps) 3) Ronaldo - 62 goals (98 caps) 4) Romario - 55 goals (70 caps) 5) Bebeto - 39 goals (75 caps) 6) Neymar - 37 goals (53 caps) Neymar has already had with a former girlfriend a son, who he vows will always be central to his life, plus a tabloid affair with a glamourous TV celebrity. Yet he remains the fresh-faced lad every Brazilian mother would love her daughter to bring home for dinner. Yet there is a feisty edge to this personality which is reminiscent, also, of the icon whose boots he is being called upon to fill. Pele could look after himself on the pitch if put to the intimidation. Similarly, when a Cameroon heavy gave him a gratuitous and potentially wounding shove into the cameramen and their heavy equipment, Neymar brushed away the false hand of apology and promptly sent his assailant and his team=mates on their way home with another defeat. We will come to recall many moments when Neymar convinced of his greatness but that will remain one of mine. Along, of course, with the goals and the wondrous touches of skill. The magic is beginning to enchant the watching world, especially as it its couched within his boyish charm. Reverence: The 22-year-old insists on having 'Neymar Jr' on his back, such is his respect for his father . The best: Pele is widely regarded as Brazil's greatest ever player but Neymar is now making his mark . Treble: Pele won three World Cups and Neymar is hoping to inspire Brazil to their sixth triumph . He scores, four times already on his way to what may be his winning of the Golden Boot at this World Cup. He winks cheekily. He smiles. He mingles with the Brazilian people as if he is still simply one of their own. In that, he is more reminiscent of Garrincha than Pele. For that, they love him all the more. But in the reckoning it is the exquisite ability that counts. In a game increasingly populated by men of muscle and power, he is a wraith wrapped around silken skills. In that he reminds me of George Best, a will o’ the wisp with the courage to deliver his talent. I defer to no-one in my worship of the pantheon of Brazilian footballers but in my estimation Neymar is close to superceding most of them... Zico, Falcao, Didi, Vava, Jairzinho, Rivellino, Romario and Ronaldinho included. Time will be the judge, of course. But he is so good that the modern generation have a discussion in which to engage which is of their time. The tendency has been to propose Lionel Messsi and Cristiano Ronaldo as the current pretenders to the thrones of not only Pele and Co but Diego Maradona, Alfredo di Stefano and Johan Cruyff. Class: Arguably only Garrincha (left) and Pele now stand ahead of Neymar in Brazil's all-time great list . Both are marvellous player but Neymar brings something all the more valid to the debate. Messi tends to operate on the wide right so as to cut in onto this wand of a  left foot and Ronaldo is inclined to work the left flank in readiness for angling in onto his potent right. But Neymar works where it hurts, where it can do the most damage, where it really matters. Through the middle. That is how he has come to play 53 games for his country at such a tender age, scoring 37 goals in the process. That is why he just might win this World Cup for Brazil. That is why he is climbing so quickly through the ranks of greatness. I would suggest that only two giants remain for him to elevate himself above - Pele and Garrincha. That enormous task does not appear to be beyond him. It will take more than one World Cup to make it happen but if he works his magic here, he could well be on his way to immortality. Perhaps, one day, he will be talked of not as the new Pele - but as the first Neymar. VIDEO Neymar will handle the pressure - Ronaldo .

"A warning to parents has been sent out by police in Denver - where at least 200 dispensary stores are licensed to sell marijuana - about the dangers of their children accidentally eating candy that is laced with weed over Halloween. The discerning video message is an attempt to show parents how easily a child could unknowingly ingest THC-infused treat, which have become hugely popular across Colorado since the state legalized recreational marijuana in January. Dispensaries have been developing their own edibles, ranging from cookies to lollipops, peanut butter cups, gum, chocolate and jelly candy. 'A kid is not going to be able to tell the difference,' Denver Police spokesman Ron Hackett told ABC News. Scroll down for video . Can you spot the difference?: A regular jelly candy (left) sits next to one sprayed with THC oil in a video posted online by the Denver Police Department ahead of Halloween . Advice: Patrick Johnson, owner of the Urban Dispensary in Denver, explains the popularity of marijuana edibles and the difficulty in discerning it from regular candy . Throw them in the trash: Authorities have warned parents to throw away any candy that looks questionable . 'My daughter is seven-years-old: She couldn't care less if it’s growing mold. She’s going to eat it.' In the video Denver police interviewed Patrick Johnson, owner of the Urban Dispensary, to explain the difference between marijuana edibles and regular candy. Johnson said that edibles account for somewhere between 20 and 30 percent of the gross sales in his shop. W'hat's happening a lot with the edible manufacturers who have focused on a hard or a soft candy is that the most cost-effective way for them to bring that to the market is to use knock-off candy,' Johnson said in the video, which was posted to YouTube on Monday. 'So they'll buy it in bulk form, then they infuse it by using viscous hash oil. 'They spray that onto the candy and once that candy dries, there's really no way to tell the difference between candy that's infused and candy that's not infused.' Hugely popular: Edible marijuana products are pictured on display at a medical marijuana dispensary in Denver on Friday, April 18, 2014. Many of the items are far more potent than a single marijuana joint . As a result, Johnson said that not only would parents have trouble discerning between a THC product and a regular sweet, but experts like himself would struggle too. He warned parents to throw away anything they remotely question. Johnson added that the safest candy to eat at Halloween is pre-packaged ones from big manufacturers such as Hershey's.

Mexico needed favours to reach the World Cup finals, now they are looking increasingly like a team nobody will want to play.

"Winning everything suits Paul Pogba. While France now look unrecognisable from the disgraced 2010 World Cup 'team', and regardless of what happens in Friday's quarter-final, will return home to an appreciative welcome, the Juventus ace will probably feel short-changed. That is simply his nature. The 21-year old fears no-one and backs himself, permanently and unreservedly. His single-mindedness has raised eyebrows, yet, given his spectacular rise and success, does not appear to have harmed him. The only way is up: Pogba points to the heavens after scoring in France's win against Nigeria . Eyes on the prize: Pogba follows the flight of the ball before looping a header to make it 1-0 . His headed goal against Nigeria last night is another step toward tightening his grip on his place in France's midfield, within a squad bursting with positivity. In many ways, the most exciting element now, for quarter-finalists France, is what the next tournament holds. A future under Didier Deschamps is tantalising with promise, punctuated by the younger and hugely motivated players. Moreover, this World Cup has proven those who are bursting onto the scene are capable of carving out victories, not just making individual impressions. Full flow: Pogba powers past Ogenyi Onazi during France's last-16 victory at Estadio Nacional . Technique: The midfielder forced Vincent Enyeama into making a fine stop from this well-struck volley . Mentor: World Cup winner and current France boss Didier Deschamps congratulates Pogba at full-time . There was room for both Pogba and benched Real Sociedad winger, Antoine Griezmann, to start. It wouldn't have been placing all unhatched eggs into one basket. Yet the eternally inconsistent, always either brilliant or thoroughly pedestrian, Olivier Giroud, started and not until the substitution could Karim Benzema rifle through the middle in his preferred position. Pogba may feel as if he were slightly isolated in the first half, but trebled his effort after the break and certainly didn't look at risk of receiving a second back-heel nutmeg from John Obi Mikel. The dynamic among individuals in France is curious. Giroud smiles, while aware of his dips in form. Benzema is rebuilding his own pride, slowly, the ache of having his dedication, and even ability, questioned during a goalless period for France which lasted 1,224 minutes, finally ending - after 58 shots – against Australia in October last year. Graceful: Pogba controls the ball brilliantly during Juventus' Europa League clash against Benfica . Formidable: At Juventus, Arturo Vidal and Pogba have formed an exceptional central-midfield partnership . Pogba is a talisman, buoyed by a solid two years – and two Scudetti – at Juve, adorned with a £60million price tag and reported keen interest from Chelsea. In a similar manner to how the phrase 'complete midfielder' has been bestowed on Monaco's Columbian James Rodriguez, it has been afforded to Pogba. Forward runs, technical ability and the well-handled assurance which comes from being both young and having played at the top level. Of course, the Under-20 World Cup winner is also a complete joy to watch. Curled free kicks into top netting are one thing, following that curve which, with Pogba, starts from a skip onto a moving ball and shifts into a volley is poetic. Let go: Pogba in action for United's youth team in an FA Youth Cup semi-final versus Chelsea . Stalled: But the Frenchman was given few first-team opportunities at Old Trafford by Sir Alex Ferguson .

While Manchester United fans will be looking in healthy anticipation to the fabulous Dutch master, Louis Van Gaal, channel-hopping through highlights of Pogba's artistry will perhaps grate. Having completed his transfer to Old Trafford in October 2009, Pogba went on to score seven goals in 21 appearances for the under-18 team, prompting Sir Alex Ferguson to promote him, alongside three other academy players, to the first team. Fergie saw his remarkable ability early on, tactically observing if Pogba were to have been held back, he would leave for another club. What he may not have accounted for, however, is how 'special treatment' is exactly why Pogba looked elsewhere. He signed for Juventus in summer 2012, complaining of how United had forced him to train alone, and somehow disrespected his status as 'an athlete, not a footballer'. Specimen: Pogba is tall, muscular and quick on the ball, making him a nightmare for his opponents . Powerful: Pogba has emerged as one of the most complete midfielders in Europe during his time in Serie A . Cynics, or perhaps just most of us, who fail to make this professional distinction, predicted another 'Le Sulk' in the making. Pogba's attitude was frequently a point of discussion, the prodigious talent criticised for what many saw as petulance and arrogance, but for Juventus boss Antonio Conte, demonstrated an iron-cast ambition. Conte praised Pogba for his response to picking up the Golden Boy award in December last year, Tuttosport's annual award for recognising the best Under-21 footballer in Europe. The player said he wanted to win 'everything', and some interpreted this as if the award were a tick in a box rather than an achievement to savour. What could have been: United let Pogba leave and now he has become a star for club and country . Conte, in a far more measured way than those who scrutinise each of Pogba's actions to deride, said it showed hunger and was certainly not disrespectful. What is seldom open for debate, is Pogba's pronounced domestic form. Few managers are in a position to guarantee first-team football during academy graduates' contract negotiations, therefore United fans shrugged him off. Maybe now, they wonder what could have been.","Midfielder scored first goal in France's 2-0 win over Nigeria in the last 16 .

"One of the greatest sporting rivalries in Australia's history is set to end as Ford has announced it will not renew it's deal with Bathurst champions Ford Performance Racing. The move by the car manufacturer, which will see the removal of V8 Supercars from it's $60 million sponsorship deal, will end the infamous rivalry between the company and Holden by the end of 2015. The unexpected move means that the upcoming Bathurst 1000 will be the second to last time the two long standing rivals with race against each other in the championship. The iconic competition was made famous 22 years ago by the late Peter Brock and Dick Johnson. Johnson, a three-times winner of the Bathurst circuit, said that he believed die-hard fans would boycott the brand, reported The Daily Telegraph. Scroll down for video . One of the greatest sporting rivalrys in Australia's history is set to end as Ford has announced it will not renew it's deal with Bathurst champions Ford Performance Racing . The move by the car manufacturer will see the removal of V8 Supercars from it's $60 million sponsorship deal . Johnson, a three-times winner of the Bathurst circuit, said that he believed die-hard fans would boycott the brand . 'It would be a disaster for the sport. From our point of view we need them here,' he said. It has been a week of surprises for Ford fanatics, with the manufacturer announcing the discontinuation of GT Falcon. The announcement also follows on the closure of Ford's Australian factory, as the manufacturer confirmed in May that it would be ceasing production in Australia . V8 Supercars CEO James Warburton confirmed that the company will have two teams who will race Ford in 2015 'even if they will not be factory backed.' 'We have consistently made our case to Ford, not only for 2015, but well into the future. They know exactly where we are going and the huge benefits we can deliver,' Warburton said. 'We would obviously love to have them continue in the sport.' The manufacturer only has two teams left in the mix, the Ford Performance Racing team and Dick Johnson Racing, which has not had official sponsorship for the last six years. 'It would be a disaster for the sport. From our point of view we need them here,' Johnson said . The iconic competition was made famous 22 years ago by the late Peter Brock and Dick Johnson . 'Growing up I always watched the Ford and Holden rivalry and was very proud to have cars made in Australia,' said Lowndes. Holden's golden boy Craig Lowndes, who is celebrating 20 years at the Bathurst 1000, has released a limited edition Commodore ahead of Saturday's race, with the car costing $60,000. The car will go into production this week and all of the vehicles will be completed by the end of 2014, reported news.com.au. 'Growing up I always watched the Ford and Holden rivalry and was very proud to have cars made in Australia,' said Lowndes. 'It was something I never thought would change. But of course times have changed and it’s going to be a very sad day to see Holden and Ford cease to be manufactured locally.' This weekend will see Mark Winterbottom representing Ford going head to head with Holden's Jamie Whincup in the 1000km blowout at Mount Panorama.","Ford has announced it will not renew multi-million dollar deal with Bathurst champions Ford Performance Racing .

"James Anderson and Joe Root combined to break a number of records as England took the lead on day four of the first Test against India at Trent Bridge. England had begun the day trailing India by 105 runs with Anderson and Root putting on an unbeaten 54 for the last wicket on Friday. But instead of going the same way as their colleagues Sam Robson, Gary Ballance and Ian Bell, who were quickly bowled out in the middle session on day three, the pair united to break the record for the highest last wicket stand in Test cricket. Leading the way: James Anderson was in imperious form for England on day four of the first Test . Record breaker: Anderson made his first ever Test century for England as they took the lead against India . Anderson also took his first ever half century and recorded the highest score by an England No 11, breaking John Snow's 59 against the West Indies at The Oval in 1966. The partnership also produced the longest innings by a No 11 in Test match cricket and England's biggest ever last wicket partnership. As if that wasn't enough the match went into the record books as the first where both No 11s have scored 50 runs. Root also recorded his fourth Test century as the 23-year-old combined with Anderson to notch a joint score of well over 200. The run eventually came to  an end after lunch when Shikhar Dhawan caught Anderson out on 81 leaving England 496 all out with a lead of 39. Anderson will continue to wait for his first Test century but he has more pressing matters at hand, as Alec Steward reminded him on Twitter. Steward said: 'Superb effort from Root and Anderson. Now back to your real day job Jimmy of taking wickets on this minefield!' James Anderson's first ever half century. Highest score by an England No 11 beating record set in 1966. Longest innings by a No 11 in Test match cricket. England's biggest ever last wicket partnership. First Test match where both No 11s have scored 50. Joe Root's fourth Test century.

"A 15-year-old says she was humiliated by a teacher who showed an enlarged picture of her in a bikini to more than 100 other students during a school assembly. Children at Eggbuckland Community College in Plymouth, Devon, were shown the photograph taken from her Facebook profile to illustrate the pitfalls of posting private images online. Unknown to the schoolgirl, who has not been named, staff had taken her swimwear photo off the internet. It was blown up and added to a portfolio of other pictures then shown during a packed school assembly. The shock tactic at the 1327-pupil specialist arts school left the girl distraught. Scroll down for video . Upset: A 15-year-old was left in tears after staff at Eggbuckland Community College in Plymouth, Devon, pictured, showed a picture of her in a bikini to a packed assembly . Her mother, who has now made an official complaint to Ofsted, said: 'They took the photo from her Facebook profile - she put it on there last year. 'They used other photos of kids from the neck up but for some reason they thought it was OK to use a picture of my daughter in her bikini. 'Why did they have to use an image like that to make their point. Then they pointed her out in the assembly. She was really upset. 'I got a phone call from my daughter in the afternoon. When she told me about it I went from nought to sixty. I was so upset at work I was sent home. 'She's really upset and hurt and this has knocked her confidence. She's not the type of girl who likes attention like this. 'She's a tom-boy, she doesn't wear make-up and she doesn't even have her ears pierced. It's not often you even get her in a bikini.' Complaint: The girl's mother, says she has had an apology from the headteacher, but has complained to Ofsted about the incident . The woman, who does not want her daughter to be identified, has now written to education watchdogs Ofsted, the board of governors and the head teacher to demand answers about the incident. She says if the school were concerned about the image, they should have pulled her daughter aside or contacted her to voice concerns - rather than using it to embarrass her. She added: 'The headteacher has since phoned me and couldn't me more apologetic. I don't think she was aware it was going to happen.' The school today said today it had stated a 'formal investigation' into the incident, which will consider the teacher's conduct. A spokesman added: 'In a House assembly last week on the topic of ""Online Safety"", students were shown a PowerPoint including a short video about the potential dangers of which they need to be aware. 'One of the images in the presentation was of an Eggbuckland student wearing shorts and a bikini top. The member of staff leading the assembly had accessed the picture simply by Googling the names of some of our students. 'She wanted to illustrate how freely available such images are, through the internet. We are really sorry for the way in which this important message was delivered. This was an error of judgement: the member of staff had not intended to cause any embarrassment'. A Plymouth City Council spokesperson said on behalf of the school, whose motto is 'Learning, caring, achieving': 'We cannot comment on the incident itself. 'It is very important that young people understand the risks of posting images and messages about themselves online. 'All our partner agencies, including all schools, have a duty to promote on-line safety and equip all pupils and students with the ability to stay safe online. 'Most images placed online on social networking sites or through the use of smartphones can be found and copied, and then shared. 'Sadly, there are people of all ages who know that they can use photographic images to bully, exploit or coerce others, and do so. 'The advice given to children and parents is that it is very difficult to ensure any picture is completely private and it is important to positively manage their online identity and profile and think carefully before sharing personal content.'","Staff at Plymouth school took the swimwear shot from her Facebook profile .

"From Moroccan oils to high-tech serums, Brazilian blow dries to GHD hair straighteners, I shudder to think how much money I have spent on trying to tame my wild mane over the years. Left to its own devices, my hair is wild, bushy and as coarse as a Brillo Pad. Only with handfuls of Kerastase anti- frizz shampoo (a snip at £13 a bottle) and lashings of super-moisturising conditioner (which comes in a gold tub and costs almost £20 a pop) does it go some way towards behaving itself. Then comes the array of argan oils, heat-protecting sprays and serums - each costing between £7 and £20 - to try to finish the job. Scroll down for video . Rave reviews: Marianne with the Mane'n'Tail products which promise shiny, glossy hair . Not impressed: Marianne after using her usual products, left, and after using Mane'n'Tail . It's no wonder I'm always going over my overdraft limit - I need a big win at the horses to pay for my hair. Which is why I was so excited when I heard about the latest bargain that's now the number one bestselling hair product on Amazon. At just £7.50 for the shampoo and the conditioner, it's said to be loved by celebrities such as Kim Kardashian, Demi Moore, Sarah Jessica Parker and Jennifer Aniston. So, what is this wonder product? Horse shampoo. Yes, you read correctly: actual horse shampoo. Mane'n'Tail was originally created for show ponies to keep their manes and tails shiny and glossy. The results were so good that, soon, the horses' owners started to use the products on their own hair - and then word spread. According to the makers, their shampoo and conditioner 'have been a best-kept secret for beauty aficionados everywhere'. The shampoo is 'fortified with moisturisers and emollients to help leave hair soft and ultra-clean', while the conditioner 'helps nourish and aid healthy hair growth, leaving hair looking lustrous and silky'. Mixed reviews: The two products cost £7.50 but it seems you'll either love them or hate them . Together, 'these micro-enriched protein formulas help to prevent hair breakage and repair split ends, achieving the goal of longer, stronger, fuller hair . . . the results are unbelievable!' Blimey. Can this really be true? I quickly get online to Amazon to order it and find out for myself. The next day, it arrives. The packaging is not exactly a glamorous addition to my bathroom - the big, white, plastic bottles have a picture of, well, a horse on them, which looks as though it's running into a yellow sunset. If John Wayne were to buy beauty products from Amazon, it would be this duo. Still, I'm hopeful. Given that horses' hair is dry, frizzy and three times thicker than human hair, I figure this stuff has got to be able to whip even my mop into shape. The shampoo is reassuringly thick and creamy, but it doesn't smell like normal shampoo. I try to put my finger on what it is like and can come up with only one thing: carpet cleaner. No horsing around: Mane'n'Tail left Marianne's hair dry and tangled . Marianne will stick to her old shampoo, left, as the horse shampoo made her feel 'like an old nag'. Her hair is much frizzier, right, after using Mane'n'Tail . The shampoo lathers well but, after rinsing, my hair feels much drier than it usually does. I apply lashings of the equally-thick conditioner, which looks creamy, but feels quite watery compared with my usual conditioner. My hair soaks it all up but, again, after rinsing, it feels dry and brittle. Things take a turn for the worse when I put my mop under the hairdryer - my hair feels like straw and looks as frazzled as if I'd put my hands into an electric socket. It's become so knotted and tangled at the ends, I even struggle to get my brush through it. I haven't experienced anything like this since I was a child. So much for show pony - I feel more like an old nag. I can't understand the rave reviews. I did more hunting in the Amazon reader comments and found that, underneath the dozens of five-star reviews, there were a few like me, who found their hair became dry and matted after use. This seems to be the Marmite of hair products - you either love it or hate it. One user said it took a while for her hair to get used to the products, so I persisted for a week. After two further washes, my hair did adjust slightly. It didn't feel quite so dry, and it did feel like it cleaned my scalp well. The tangles, however, remained. So, there'll be no more horsing around for me. I will return to my usual, reassuringly expensive hair products - and maybe have a flutter on the gee-gees to help pay for them.","Mane'n'Tail was created for show ponies .

"There were many times on Monday, during Eugenie Bouchard’s straight-sets victory over Alize Cornet when it was easy to forget she was playing in only her sixth Grand Slam main draw. The world No 13, from Canada, is just 20 and won the Wimbledon girls’ title as recently as 2012, yet she is now just one win from reaching her third consecutive Grand Slam semi-final. She dispatched Cornet, who knocked out Serena Williams in the third round, with the same charming efficiency as she treated  post-match questions about her family’s obsession with royalty. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Bouchard dazzle during Sportsmail photoshoot . Roar of delight: Eugenie Bouchard celebrates after beating Alize Cornet on Centre Court on Monday . Nothing seemed to faze her, but then Bouchard is named after  Princess Eugenie of York, so perhaps it was fitting she performed  so well under the Centre Court  roof in front of a Royal Box  boasting the Duke of Kent and the Countess of Wessex. The ‘temple of tennis’, she called it, noting dryly that she ‘follows the roof on Twitter, so I hope he was proud of me’. There was also sporting royalty looking on in the shape of Sir Alex Ferguson, although Bouchard — and particularly her mother, who called her twin daughters Eugenie and Beatrice and her son William — might have preferred the other ‘Fergie’, Sarah. ‘First off, I should say it’s a  parental interest in royalty,’ said Bouchard, smiling, ‘probably mostly my mother. She named us, so I wasn’t really aware of what was going on at that time. She’s kind of a closet royalist. ‘I can be a princess, though. I can be moody in the morning and my fitness trainer carries my tennis bag around. ‘But that’s so I don’t get tired because I want to save all my energy for the match. I can demand a few things once in a while but I do it with love.’ Eyes on the prize: Eugenie Bouchard stretches to reach a ball during her victory over Alize Cornet . Fans favourtie: The Wimbledon crowd showed their support for Eugenie Bouchard on Monday . Bouchard may admit she is prone to the occasional princess-like moment, but the only thing  precious about her display yesterday was her talent. She would obviously have  preferred to face Cornet over  Williams, but the Frenchwoman, ranked No 24 in the world, was still a testing, experienced opponent. FA chairman Greg Dyke inexplicably appeared to snooze off towards the end, but  this was a close, high-quality encounter  with plenty of entertaining tennis. Cornet was playing in her 34th Grand Slam and, at the age of 24, is a veteran  of two Olympic Games. She chased, harried, shrieked, played some exquisite drop shots and enjoyed success at the net as she tried to rush Bouchard, but the Canadian kept her cool and responded by moving up a gear when it mattered. Her flat, hard groundstrokes were erratic at times, particularly on the forehand side or when trying to take the ball out of the air, but she rarely panicked and showed maturity far beyond her tender years. Not this time: Cornet couldn't pull off another surprise win over Bouchard having beaten Williams previously . Not impressed? Sir Alex Ferguson appeared to be falling asleep during Bouchard's victory . Bouchard said she was a ‘bit of a nerd’, enjoyed maths at school and had Jim  Parsons, star of TV show The Big Bang Theory, watching from the players’ box. There is certainly a calculated, almost unemotional approach to her play. Fans known as Genie’s Army have thrown cuddly toys on to court at previous Grand Slams but there is nothing soft about Bouchard’s on-court demeanour. Her steely resilience means she has far more in common with her idol Maria Sharapova than just blonde hair and Hollywood looks. A 20-minute delay with Cornet leading 3-2 on serve in the first set, Bouchard’s first experience under the Centre Court roof and a 4-1 deficit to overcome in the first-set tiebreak were simply obstacles for her to scale. She had to come from behind in the second set, too, slipping 4-2 behind and then pushing an ill-advised forehand volley horribly wide to give Cornet a sniff of a second break at 30-30 in the  seventh game. Plenty to ponder: Greg Dyke looked like he had a lot on his mind as he sat in the Royal Box at Wimbledon . Bouchard clung on, however, forcing Cornet to serve for the set at 5-4, and then pounced on a  second serve, breaking back at the second time of asking. From then she did not look back, racing through the three remaining games in classy style to wrap up the match in 1hr 46min. Bouchard said: ‘I believe in myself. Every match I play, I believe I can win. I’ve proved to myself I can play on the big stage and I’m proud of the way I handle it out there. I think I was able to step up on the important moments. ‘I’ve been in situations like that before, so I had full belief in myself that I wasn’t out of it. ‘This is what I’ve worked so hard for — to be in the quarter-finals of Wimbledon — but I don’t want to stop here.’ Bouchard next plays the winner of Sharapova vs Angelique Kerber, who could not start their match on Court One last night. If one of that pair reaches the semi-finals, they will have to play three games in as many days.","Bouchard won 7-6, 7-5 and will now face Maria Sharapova or Angelique Kerber in Wimbledon last eight .

"There was a moment after Argentina’s semi-final victory over Holland when Javier Mascherano was reminded of his match-saving challenge on Arjen Robben late in the second half. ‘I thought I had slipped, I thought I wouldn’t make it, but I tore my arse on that move, the pain . . .’ he admitted after his perfectly-executed tackle inside the area prevented the Dutch flyer from homing in on goal.

"Helicopter rescue teams airlifted a 68-year-old American man to hospital after he was attacked by bears while hunting on a remote island off the coast of Alaska. The man, identified as Michael Snowden, was transported by coast guards to Kodiak Municipal Airport where he was passed on to medical services who treated him for serious leg injuries. It is understood a group of up to five bears attacked Mr Snowden and his friend Jeff Ostrin as they dragged the carcass of a deer they had shot through dense vegetation on Sally Island in Uganik Bay. Scroll down for video . Threat: A group of up to five bears attacked Michael Snowden and his friend Jeff Ostrin as they dragged the carcass of a deer they had shot through dense vegetation on Sally Island in Uganik Bay. File picture . The attack took place yesterday afternoon on a remote island off the southern coast of mainland Alaska. The state is home to 98 per cent of the United States' total brown bear population. Nathan Svoboda, a local wildlife biologist, gave details of the attack to Alaska Dispatch News. He said the two men where dragging a deer through vegetation when they stopped for lunch. No sooner had they sat down to eat when a large female bear charged at them. The animal reportedly attacked Snowden, biting and scratching his body before Ostrin, 38, shot the animal three times, killing it. Seconds later, more bears emerged, with Ostrin shooting and killing one of the cubs. The shooting apparently scared the rest of the animals away. The crew on board a fishing vessel witnessed the entire incident and reportedly raced to the shore to remove the men to the safety of the sea, with the captain calling the coast guard to the scene. Saved: Michael Snowden, was transported by Alaska State Troopers to Kodiak Municipal Airport where he was passed on to medical services who treated him for serious leg injuries File picture . Mr Snowden was first transported by helicopter to Kodiak Municipal Airport, before being taken to the Providence Kodiak Island Medical Center where he was treated for serious leg wounds. His condition is not thought to be life-threatening. 'The fact that there were five bears was an abnormality and this serves as a reminder that anything can happen and we need to be aware of our surroundings,' said Lt. Joseph Schlosser, operational unit watchstander for the Coast Guard 17th District. Hunters in rural Alaska are told not to carry the entire carcasses of animals they have killed because bears are attracted by the smell of blood. Instead, hunters are advised to carefully butcher the animals where they died and place the meat into sealed containers. The attack comes after a woman jogging at an Air Force base in Alaska survived an attack by a female that was defending its two cubs.","Michael Snowden was taken to hospital with serious leg injuries .

"Health inspectors making checks on GPs’ surgeries are routinely snooping through the private medical records of patients without their consent. Officials from the Care Quality Commission are demanding computer passwords from GPs to allow them to access the medical files of patients during routine inspections. The watchdog claims it needs to see the records to monitor ‘clinical quality’ – such as whether doctors are giving out the correct advice or medication and following up on blood test results. But senior doctors and health experts have described it as a ‘fishing exercise’ which threatens to undermine patient confidentiality. Dr Clare Gerada, former president of the Royal College of GPs, described the CQC’s actions as outrageous. Care Quality Commission officials are looking at peoples' medical records, without consent, during inspections . Only yesterday the Daily Mail revealed that NHS officials are to press ahead with a highly controversial project of harvesting data from millions of patients’ records to store on a giant database. They will shortly begin extracting information from up to 1.7million patients despite concerns from doctors that it will fall into the hands of hackers. It has now emerged that the CQC is routinely trawling through patients’ medical records – stored on computers – as part of their inspections of 8,000 surgeries in England, which began in April. Inspectors are standing over GPs and practice managers and demanding they hand over the passwords enabling them to access the medical files. They clearly state patients’ names, dates of birth and addresses as well as their complete medical history, including past conditions and complaints they may never have divulged to family or friends. Rules on who can see medical records without seeking the patient’s consent are highly ambiguous. The CQC claims it can trawl through them during routine inspections under the Health and Social Care Act 2008. But guidelines from doctors’ regulator the General Medical Council say they should only be handed over in exceptional circumstances to the likes of the police, a court or health officials. From time to time, researchers, private organisations or NHS trusts ask to see records in order to analyse trends. But the guidelines instruct GPs to provide them on an anonymous basis to protect patients’ identities, and only where there is a clear public interest, such as for research into certain diseases or NHS care. Even the GMC can only get hold of records on an anonymous basis when investigating doctors who face being struck off. Dr Gerada, a GP at the Hurley Group which runs practices and walk-in centres across London, said: ‘It’s outrageous. If this was my record I would not want it looked at by anybody without my consent. ‘The patient record is sacrosanct. It’s your secret record and unless you give consent no one should have access to it.’ Speaking to Pulse magazine, which was also made aware of the CQC’s actions, she later added: ‘I am surprised as to the ease that CQC can access patient records for inspection purposes where there has not been any previous identified patient or clinical performance issues. ‘Not even the GMC (General Medical Council) can, I believe, enter a practice and for no reason demand to see patient records.’ Dr Chaand Nagpaul, chairman of the British Medical Association’s GP committee, said it was vital private medical information remained confidential . Dr Chaand Nagpaul, chairman of the British Medical Association’s GP committee, said: ‘The confidentiality of private medical information is the basis of the trust that patients put in their family doctors and it is vital that this is not compromised. ‘If CQC inspectors want to have access to the private medical records of patients they need to put in place systems that obtain the explicit consent of patients.’ Roy Lilley, a health policy analyst and former chairman of an NHS trust, said: ‘Complete strangers are probing through our medical records. It’s just a fishing exercise in our most personal records.’ Ordinarily, doctors cannot hand over patient records without their consent to anyone except the police or another doctor or nurse treating them. This is enshrined in the GMC’s guidelines for doctors on patient confidentiality. But the CQC claims it was granted legal powers to see the files without seeking consent under the Health and Social Care Act 2008. GPs whose surgeries are being inspected feel they have no choice but to hand over the records to inspectors in case they are given a bad rating. The CQC would not say how many records inspectors look at for each surgery but the Mail understands they ask to see several at random. If the watchdog has concerns about a practice it may demand to see dozens more. The CQC inspections of surgeries involve three or four inspectors, including a former GP or practice nurse as well as inspectors previously employed as NHS managers or council workers who have had training. Nigel Sparrow, senior national GP adviser at the CQC, said: ‘The main purpose of the review of medical records is to assess the quality of care provided by the practice. It is not to assess the individual clinician. In routine inspections, the GP or nurse specialist adviser will look at the medical records. ‘Although the 2008 Health and Social Care Act does not require this, our view is that in most cases it is appropriate for the clinicians on the team to lead this aspect of the inspection. ‘This will usually be the case but where inspection teams have concerns about a practice it may be necessary for any of the inspectors to access medical records or to see a medical record.’ The CQC has a chequered past, missing several scandals, notably the abuse of vulnerable adults at the Winterbourne View care home near Bristol in 2011. Its plan to let relatives spy on care homes using secret cameras if they suspect loved ones are being abused were this week called an ‘admission of failure’.","Health inspectors making surgery checks are accessing medical records .

"I’ve never been so angry watching a game as a neutral. My initial shock and fascination at what was unfolding soon turned to disgust at half-time. It wasn’t just Brazil’s lack of defensive ability, their lack of interest in defending was a disgrace. As a player I have had bad games and suffered heavy losses (never 7—1 though!) and walked away wishing the outcome had been different. But from 2-0 down the lack of leadership and character was something I don’t think I’ve ever seen at the top level. VIDEO Scroll down for 'Six minutes of nightmares' - Scolari . Opener: Thomas Muller scores Germany's first to set Joachim Low's men on their way to a 7-1 victory . Rudderless: David Luiz was captain on the night but he showed no leadership skills as Brazil collapsed . Off target: Luiz resorted to trying to hurt his opponents as his side's gameplan fell apart in Belo Horizonte . The first of many: Luiz can be excused for the first goal but his defending was woeful throughout . VIDEO 'Six minutes of nightmares' - Scolari . It started with Marcelo, who has been poor from game one, and can’t defend. He was trying to be clever with a step-over,  followed by a blind pass. Germany broke, he scampered back and conceded the corner and was then apologising. I’m still astonished that Atletico Madrid’s Filipe Luis is not in the squad never mind the team as I didn’t see a better left back in Europe last  season — or in this competition to date. The corner for the first goal was a well-worked routine from the Germans with Thomas Muller losing David Luiz, who was blocked off. You perhaps can excuse him for that one. But how can anyone try to explain the overall defensive performance of the Brazilian captain? I have never been a fan, then warmed to him in this tournament, but… that was as bad a central defensive performance as I’ve seen from someone at this level. Record breaker: Miroslav Klose celebrates after becoming the top scorer in World Cup history with 16 . Lethal: Brazil midfielder Fernandinho watches on, as their defenders did all night, while Klose slots home . Partners: Brazil, whose team bus has the slogan 'Brace yourselves! The sixth is coming!', were humiliated . In my preview to the game, I mentioned his leadership qualities: rallying the crowd, taking a penalty, consoling players after they’d missed theirs. That’s the easier bit of leadership. The difficult part is on the pitch: organising the players around you, cajoling your team-mates, making people around you perform better, setting an example in times of trouble. He didn’t do that. Instead he allowed Brazil to sink. He was running all over the pitch, failing to hold his position. Then went for the oldest trick in the book, trying to hurt German players to show the crowd how determined he was. He caught Miroslav Klose with an elbow twice, then took a wild swing at Muller in the second half — that was embarrassing. Certain centre backs are leaders, while others need to be led. After this game, it is obvious what category he is in! He shoots, he scores: Germany midfielder Toni Kroos nets his side's third past after more poor defending . Watching the first half, as Germany raced into a 5-0 lead, took me back to how people must have reacted when watching Liverpool’s first half against AC Milan in  Istanbul, where it actually becomes painful to watch. The half-time whistle reminded me of the dressing room that night — but we were only 3-0 down! Our dressing room then was in a state of shock, heads bowed with embarrassment. But that night in Istanbul we somehow rallied each other. Then, in the second half, with a combination of determination  and some tactical changes, we got ourselves back into the game. To be fair, Luiz Felipe Scolari made changes and Brazil should have scored a couple before Germany made it 6-0. Kroos-ing to victory: Dante and Julio Cesar can do little more than look at each other after the fourth goal . Easy does it: Sami Khedira slots the ball home to give Germany into a 5-0 lead on 29 minutes . Opposites: Germany celebrate but David Luiz is unable to lift his teammates as the scoreline worsens . The Germans must take huge credit for their work-rate and  intelligence. More importantly, their composure in a semi-final of a World Cup was remarkable. They scored three goals, from Klose, Toni Kroos and Sami Khedira, as if playing a training game, passing the ball around the penalty box. The goals and intelligence of Muller, the strings being pulled by Kroos on his 50th cap — and both are only 24 — were impressive, but we should also mention the beautifully-timed tackles and assists of Phillip Lahm, who is the best full back in the game, and the imposing features in goals of the outstanding Manuel Neuer. People have said the only thing missing from this tournament is an outstanding team, but I think we’ve seen one now. No way back: Oscar and Fred stand in the centre circle - something they did all too frequently on Tuesday night . Too little, too late: Oscar scored a consolation for the host nation in the dying minutes but it was pointless . Don’t forget they beat Cristiano Ronaldo’s Portugal 4-0 in the first game and this team have a strong influence from Bayern Munich similar to the one Barcelona had on the Spanish team over the last few years. Bayern have won eight  trophies in the past two years and Germany now look odds on to add an international trophy to that domestic haul. The 1-7 result will be remembered a lot longer in Brazil than in  Germany. The 1950 Brazil team were always reminded of their defeat by Uruguay in the final and they only lost 2-1! This result has shocked the world.","Hosts beaten 7-1 by clinical Germans .

"Former Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney hit the campaign trail hard this week for GOP hopefuls across the country, laying hefty criticism on the current occupant of the White House wherever he went. President Barack Obama 'went around the world and apologized for America. Now it's time for him to apologize to America,' Romney said of the man who dashed his presidential dreams while speaking at a rally in Livonia, Michigan, for Senate candidate Terri Lynn Land on Thursday. 'It's just tragic the mistakes that have been made,' the Republican heavyweight told the same audience, according to a reporter for The Detroit News. But don't take Romney's prolific campaigning against President Obama and his Democratic allies as a sign that the two-time presidential contender is applying to be the nation's Commander in Chief a third time. As Romney repeatedly told reporters this week, it's not going to happen. President Barack Obama 'went around the world and apologized for America. Now it's time for him to apologize to America,' former Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney said on Thursday while stumping for Michigan Senate candidate Terri Lynn Land . Romney is pictured here greeting and introducing Land, left, at a rally in Livonia, Michigan . 'I'm not running, I'm not planning on running and I expect to be supporting one of the many people who I think are looking at this race,' the former Massachusetts governor said Thursday. 'We have a number of different voices within our party that have have different views about where america should go and I look forward to supporting one of them,' he added, according to The Courier-Journal. 'I don't know which one it will be.' Romney was in Louisville, Kentucky, campaigning for Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell when he attempted to make his presidential aspirations, or lack thereof, crystal clear. There, he also decried almost every major foreign policy decision Obama has made as president, accusing him of 'misjudging Russia's intentions and ambitions, misunderstanding what would happen if we did not support moderate voices in Syria and get them armed, misunderstanding what would happen if Iraq didn't have a status of forces agreement with American troops staying behind to help support the Iraqi military.' In Michigan, the place of Romney's birth and the state his father George Romney served as governor, the former presidential nominee pleaded with his audience to elect Land to the Senate in November in order to place a check on President Obama. The Senate is controlled by Democrats as present, but Republicans have a strong chance of swinging the pendulum their way in the upcoming midterm elections. 'I need your help. Michigan definitely can be the difference between new leadership in the Senate, or more of [Senate Majority Leader] Harry Reid,' Romney said in remarked captured by CBS's Washington, D.C. affiliate. Romney was busy, busy, busy this week as he crisscrossed seven states to campaign for Republicans competing in November's elections . After campaigning for Land in Michigan on Thursday, Romney flew to Kentucky to show his support for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, right. McConnell is pictured here walking hand in hand with his wife Elaine Chao before at a press conference with Romney at Donamire Farm in Lexington, Kentucky . Romney spent his week doing his part to help Republicans take a majority in the upper chamber, traveling to seven battleground states in the span of five days. The amped up campaign schedule gave reporters and candidates alike multiple opportunities to press him on his plans in 2016. At an appearance on Wednesday in Atlanta, Georgia, with Republican attorney general candidate Sam Olen, Romney reiterated that he's just trying to 'help people who are running for something' and isn't out on the trail this fall to further his own political ambitions. 'I was honored to become the Republican nominee, so I continue to have some voice. But I'm not running for anything,' he told reporters, according to CBS. 'And I'm making my effort known in the states that welcome me.' CBS noted that Olen told Romney, 'I wish you were on 1600 Pennsylvania Ave.' 'I'm just sad I'm not able to be there either,' Romney replied, after a reporter prodded him about giving it another shot. 'I'd like to be in the White House. I wish I would have had the chance,' Romney lamented. Romney has said for months that he doesn't intend to seek his party's nomination to the presidency for a third time, but ambiguous statements about how 'circumstances can change' and comments from wife, Ann, about what it would take for Mitt to enter the race next year have left fans of the Republican politician hoping he'll give it another go after all. The New York Times may have doused even more cold water on Romney's alleged 2016 plans this week when it reported that Mitt and Ann were permanently relocating to Utah be closer to their son Josh, who owns property adjacent to the land they've been building a 5,900 square foot home on for the last year and a half or so. They also bought an $8.9 million home in the state last year and have been living in it part time ever since. Romney's last two presidential campaigns were run out of Massachusetts, where he currently resides, by longtime aides - many of whom worked for him since his time as governor. A move to Utah would make little sense for the Romneys from an operational standpoint if Mitt secretly hopes to run again.","'I'm not running, I'm not planning on running and I expect to be supporting one of the many people who I think are looking at this race,' he said .

"Stella McCartney never has a problem filling her front row. Her shows are easily some of the most hotly anticipated over the fashion week period. In fact her shows have become so exclusive and well respected that the 42-year-old British designer has taken to presenting her collections at Paris Fashion Week rather than in her home town of London. And yet despite her relocation fans of the brand are still prepared to travel far and wide in order to catch a glimpse of her sought-after SS15 creations with today's front row including Coco Rocha, Bar Refaeli, Salma Hayak and of course, the illusive American Vogue editor Anna Wintour. Scroll down for video . Cara Delevingne appeared more sophisticated than ever on today's Stella McCartney catwalk . Loyal fans of Stella's are sure not to be disappointed with her latest line as today's models sauntered down the runway in a collection that stayed true to the designer's relaxed yet elegant style. Models wore lose-fitting dresses in elegant silks. The theme for the collection was clearly oversized as billowing shirts and parachute trousers proved that bigger is better. Other, more feminine pieces included sheer slips printed with intricate patterns and decorated with structured embroidery giving the dresses body and shape. Fans of the brand can rejoice as the 42-year-old designer presented her usual relaxed designs . Oversized outlines and muted tones were on the menu at the show in Paris this morning . Stella embraced the much appreciated SS15 trend of flat shoes on her catwalk today . The designer hasn't completely forgotten her British style routes as she gave a nod to the bare nipple trend that consumed the catwalks of London Fashion Week. Naked breasts appeared across the catwalks of Christopher Kane,  Burberry and Erdem during the London shows and they were seen again today peeping from under the delicate slips and tartan silk dresses. As well as following the trend for exposed chests, Stella embraced the (much appreciated) fashion for flat shoes with models taking to the runway in various leather sandals, fastened with leather thongs snaking up their ankles. As well as flat shoes, Stella also seemed to give a nod towards the bare breast trend that was seen across the catwalks of London Fashion Week . Cara seemed on her best behaviour today (right) following last season where she caused quite a stir (left) when she led models astray by skipping down the catwalk . Although the collection seemed to be consistent with her previous collections with her AW14 line featuring the similar shapes to today's offerings, there was one element to the show that differed greatly from last season and that was Cara Delevingne. Last season saw the 22-year-old model causing a stir during Stella's catwalk when she skipped down the runway leading other's astray as she closed the show, however today she appeared to be on her very best behaviour. Cara appeared on the catwalk looking more serious and sophisticated than ever in palette of black and dark grey as she wore an oversized embellished coat and lace shorts. Her sleeked back hair and solemn expression provided a complete turn-around from the previous season that saw the usually goofy Cara taking centre stage. It appears that the 22-year-old is growing up in the world of fashion and what better place to do it than on the runway of one of the world's most sophisticated designers. The illusive American Vogue Editor, Anna Wintour refused to miss this morning's catwalk . Salma Hayak was spotted on today's front row and backstage with Stella (left) and fashionable friends Coco Rocha and Bar Refaeli (right) were also keen to see what Stella had on offer this season .

"Luis Suarez could get his four-month ban for biting put on hold so he can play from the start of the season. FIFA rejected an appeal by Suarez and the Uruguay Football Federation against his suspension for biting Italy’s Giorgio Chiellini. Suarez is now considering an appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS), asking them to suspend the ban pending their verdict. Banned: Luis Suarez has seen his appeal against his four-month ban for biting Giorgio Chiellini rejected . Chance: Suarez could still get his ban put on hold via the Court of Arbitration of Sport . CAS could refuse but, if agreed, it could mean Suarez being available at the start of the domestic season, which is expected to be with Barcelona when the striker’s move from Liverpool is confirmed. The downside is that if the CAS agreed, Suarez would lose the close-season part of his ban and miss even more football if helost his appeal. That issue would be a key part of transfer discussions between Liverpool and Barcelona. Suarez’s ban was imposed on June 26 and as well as the four-match ban from all football activity, there was a nine-match international ban and a £66,000 fine. FIFA head of media Delia Fischer confirmed CAS could order the ban to be suspended while it dealt with the case. VIDEO Suarez appeal rejected . Bye bye: Luis Suarez will move to Barcelona from Liverpool in a £75million deal . Decision: Suarez has 10 days to request the full written reasons for the appeal being rejected by FIFA . If Suarez wants to pursue the matter he has 10 days to request the full written reasons for the appeal being rejected by FIFA, after which he can lodge a further appeal with CAS.

"One mother has revealed how she makes butter out of her own breast milk. Michelle Cohn, 26, of Rockville, Maryland, shared pictures of her creation on Reddit, calling it 'butter that I made without ever leaving my house! Pretty cool.' Describing the flavor afterwards, she told MailOnline: 'It was very sweet and it was very creamy - it was really good.' Scroll down for video . The final product: Maryland mother Michelle Cohn made butter using nothing but her own breast milk . Ms Cohn, who has a 16-month-old daughter, shared the simple process she used. The idea occurred to her when she was home alone for the first time since her daughter was born. 'I needed to make sure that I kept my milk production up,' she says. 'So I was hand expressing into a little container and then I remembered one time I was at a fair and they had a butter-making contest, where they had milk in jars and you shook it. 'So I wondered if you could do that with breast milk. I looked it up online and sure enough, you could and I did it.' Sole ingredient: Ms Cohn started with a container filled with her own breast milk . More volume: She then moved it to a larger container, and continued to add milk . She says the first time she tried it, she used about two ounces of milk, and after she shook it for about 45 minutes, the first butter began to form. She shook it for another 15 minutes, which yielded a small amount of butter - the size of a soybean. 'The next day, I put a little bit of milk in the fridge overnight and I added to that the next day, but a lot more - closer to eight ounces - and I started shaking. And that time, within about two minutes, I had butter,' she says. Ms Cohn says the result was 'not all that different from regular butter.'

Ms Cohn says she posted the photos on Reddit because she thought others might find them interesting . She adds: 'I think the idea of an adult person consuming breast milk or a product of breast milk is sort of novel, so people are unsure how to react to it.'","Michelle Cohn of Rockville, Maryland, discovered that all it takes is vigorous shaking to turn breast milk into butter .

"A couple of New Zealand men, who were desperate to move a fridge despite lacking ropes, were caught taking the saying 'when there's a will, there's a way' just one step too far. One sure-footed West Auckland man was seen perching atop a black Nissan over the weekend while holding a large fridge in place on the roof of the vehicle. With no ropes to pin the fridge down and only thongs on his feet, the man stayed in place on the boot of the Nissan as a second man drove the car on Friday. Scroll down for video . A New Zealand man was seen balancing on the back of a moving black Nissan while holding a fridge in place . The photo, snapped by someone driving in a car behind the precarious movers, has gained over 600 likes and 300 shares on Facebook. Since being shared on social media, the man balancing on the boot of the car, Daniel Jackson, has identified himself by commenting on the posts. 'Hae, this is me. We didn't have a rope and needed that fridge, but no dent incurred and we got it home safely,' Mr Jackson wrote in a comment below the picture. Other Facebook users soon began berating the man, accusing him of putting both himself and other drivers at risk. The man later identified himself on social media when the image went viral, ignoring all the criticisms . Earlier in the month, Australia's highway patrol officers shared images like this of some of the most questionable do-it-yourself delivery drivers on New South Wales' roads . 'Well yous wouldn't want to see any other photos of things we have moved on a roof then lol,' Mr Jackson responded. He later added: 'I was there to hold it so it wouldn't [fall and harm other motorists] and it was at most 1km up the road from Rosier Road to Leo Street and we were going no more than 20kph so calm down and see the lighter side guys'. Despite his lack of concern, New Zealand police have condemned the dangerous behaviour while expressing interest in identifying and questioning the two men. These men doubled up as passengers and a support mechanism for a bed loaded to the roof of a car . Fruit packs illegally tied to the back of this ute make it impossible for this driver to see through his rear vision mirror .

"Finn Harvey Schneider, whose real name was Raymond Fairclough used 17 different names to claim a range of benefits and continue working . A fraudster who changed his name 17 times to claim a £47,000 in benefits received a suspended jail sentence. Finn Harvey Schneider, 47, from Osgathorpe, Leicestershire, used bogus names such as Rai River Croft and Zachary Caleb Maxillian to earn up to £1,000 a week working odd jobs, while claiming benefits at the same time. Leicester Crown Court heard how Schneider changed the names on his driving licence more than 12 times to keep up with his 'sophisticated' frauds and lived in a 'fantasy world'. Schneider's original name is believed to have been Raymond Fairclough and over the past five years he has created 17 different personas for himself. He even changed his name to Rai River Croft since his arrest. The court heard how Schneider was claiming benefits including a carer's allowance, job seekers' allowance, disability living allowance, social fund payments and incapacity benefit under one name but working and earning up to £1,000 a week in various other names. Schneider pleaded guilty to cheating the public revenue out of £42,042 by fraudulently claiming a variety of benefits by using false names, between March 2007 and October 2012. In 2009, Schneider claimed disability living allowance because he claimed he had depression, was awaiting a hip operation, was liable to self-harm, suffered panic attacks and needed a full-time carer. But it turned out Schneider was actually working and earning money at the same time. Schneider also admitted failing to notify Oadby and Wigston Borough Council of a change in circumstances, when claiming housing and council tax benefits, totalling £5,088, between April 2009 and October 2012. Leicester Crown Court was told Schneider was suffering from mental problems, including a personality disorder, which could have contributed to his criminal behaviour. He was given a 12-month jail sentence, suspended for two years. Schneider received a 12-month jail sentence suspended for two years at Leicester Crown Court, pictured . Judge Nicholas Dean QC said: 'It seems to some extent you live in a fantasy world relating to your identity. 'I don't know if you're pulling the wool over everyone's eyes or not, or whether in truth you suffered abuse in childhood, or suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder, or other disorders, as referred to in the psychiatric report, such as depression and anxiety. 'It would be inappropriate for me to make a finding that the psychiatric report is wrong. 'You were a persistent and rather sophisticated fraudster who managed to obtain over £40,000 in benefits you weren't entitled to. Finn Harvey Schneider . Damian Cleary . Rhys Phoenix Robinson .

'It may be part of your offending is a product of your personality disorder; a product of the person you are, rather than calculated criminality - it's very hard to say.' Simon Worlock, prosecuting, said: 'The Crown traced 17 names having been used, but not all of those were done during the period of offending. 'He obtained changes in names on driving licences and got new National Insurance numbers.' Olwen Davies, mitigating, said Schneider's mental health issues 'go back a long time', prior to the offending. 'His change of names is accounted for by his psychiatric illness. 'He's suffered poetic justice as officials will only deal with him in his original name of Fairclough, and he no longer has those papers and can't claim benefits.' She said he was subject to a 'refund system' which means he would be repaying the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) until 2050. The judge also placed Schneider on a Financial Reporting Order, under the 2005 Serious Organised Crime Police Act, for 10 years. It means he must report annually to an officer of the DWP with full details of his income, current P45 or P60 and evidence of his name and address.

"Saxophonist: Raphael Ravenscroft, of Exeter, Devon, died following a suspected heart attack on Sunday . The musician behind one of the most recognisable saxophone solos - on Gerry Rafferty's hit Baker Street - has died. Raphael Ravenscroft, 60, who found fame almost overnight following the release of the 1978 track, went on to work with music icons such as Pink Floyd, Abba and Marvin Gaye. More recently Ravenscroft, of Exeter, Devon, also worked as a session musician for pop artists Daft Punk and Duffy. He died following a suspected heart attack early on Sunday. Ravenscroft is reported to have been paid £27 for the session with a cheque that bounced, while the hit reached number three in the UK charts and number two in the US. Rafferty was said to have earned £80,000 a year from the royalties on the song alone. In a radio interview in 2011, Ravenscroft said hearing the song annoyed him. He said: ‘I'm irritated because it's out of tune. Yeah, it's flat. By enough of a degree that it irritates me at best.’ He had already appeared on one disco album by Maxine Nightingale, Right Back Where We Started From, in 1976, as an arranger but emerged as one of pop-rock's most prominent sax men. In 1990 Ravenscroft, also a former tutor of music at York College, published a successful instruction book, The Complete Saxophone Player. Scroll down for video .

"Karen Danczuk is unrepentant about the cleavage baring selfies she posts on Twitter . The French have a rather charming phrase for a woman with a seriously impressive chest. She has, they say ‘beaucoup de conversation’ – plenty to say for herself. And Britain’s most famous local councillor, MP’s wife Karen Danczuk, does indeed have plenty to say for herself, both literally and in the Gallic sense. Today, her famous bust is like a Zeppelin; large, rigid, and heading skywards. It’s encased in a 34E bra but I think she’s bigger than that, way bigger. ‘I haven’t had myself measured. I stick with an E because those bigger sizes, the Fs and Gs...’ She drops her voice conspiratorially. ‘They’re scary, right?’ Her bosoms are more familiar to her thousands of Twitter followers in a state of deshabille in a low- cut dress, vest-top or bikini. Her passion for selfies has seen her post a summer’s worth of pictures, which have made her – or rather her deep, caramel-coloured cleavage – an online star. And because Karen Danczuk is wily and because political creatures need a high profile like they need to breathe oxygen, she’s seized the kind of opportunity for advancement enjoyed by busty girls since Nell Gwyn got ’em out for Charles II. She’s now a fully paid-up member of both the Labour Party and the Twitterati. But is she too much of a Twitter-tarti for us to take her seriously – and is this storm in an E-cup the electoral strategy of a Westminster wannabe? I headed to Rochdale, her husband’s constituency, to ask. ‘I did not think “I’ll post some selfies and have a publicity hit,”’ she tells me. ‘I don’t look at myself and think, “Oooh, Karen, you’re gorgeous.” I don’t have the confidence or the arrogance people think I do. ‘I’m not fame-hungry. I just take selfies going about my business like millions of others. The only time I show my chest off is if I’m going out, dressed up on Friday night, when I’m not Councillor Karen or Businesswoman Karen, I’m just being myself. And that’s allowed. Anyway, if I had to pick my best feature I’d say I quite like my eyes.’ Among those who would beg to differ are the lads’ mags that have offered her significant amounts of money to pose topless. But she’s not interested. ‘You’ll not be seeing my assets on the front of a magazine any time soon.’ And she’s unrepentant about the controversy she has caused. ‘I’m a woman, I have boobs and if you want to talk to them you can, or you can talk to my brain. I’m not a feminist who’s furious.’ No, indeed, I’d say she was thrilled and is working out how to parlay her chest’s popularity into a proper political career. She half-admits as much when she says: ‘I’m honoured by all the support I’ve had and I do not underestimate the benefits of it all.’ A classic politician’s answer. Karen is the wife of the Rochdale MP Simon Danczuk, whose plain-talking on issues such as immigration and whose investigation into child sex abuse and the grooming scandals in his constituency has made him a figure of influence. So how does he feel about it all? A typical picture posted on Twitter by Mrs Danczuk - for which she has been heavily criticised . ‘Rochdale has given us Gracie Fields, Lisa Stansfield and Anna Friel. We have a fine reputation for supporting glamour and Karen is a very smart-looking woman. Besides,’ he twinkles, ‘I am quite happy to see her cleavage. Why wouldn’t I be?’ Not everyone has been, though. Karen was ambushed live on ITV’s Loose Women last week and told by Janet Street-Porter that she was a bad role model for young women. Former Tory MP Louise Mensch has also accused Karen’s ‘memorable mammaries’ of cheapening the work of women in politics, labelling her Westminster’s ‘most embarrassing wife’. This, Karen attributes, to old-fashioned class war. Mrs Danczuk (pictured centre) was ambushed on Loose Women last week and told she was a 'bad role model' ‘I still come across snobbery,’ she says. ‘I face people like Louise Mensch who believe you should know your place in society. Well, we’re all different and I believe a Labour Government would speak more widely and warmly to people like me. I am Labour. I define myself as “working-class Karen” and I will never forget my roots. Because I lead a middle-class life, some would argue than I should now be a Tory voter but I would never flip.’ She and Simon live with their two sons – Maurice, four and Milton, six – in a modest three-bedroom bungalow. (No duck-house here.) When I arrive Simon is in the kitchen with a pinny protecting his pinstripes, making a vat of Lancashire stew between political appointments. Karen who, at 31, is 16 years his junior, appears from the bedroom, with her curlers still in. She is also wearing a sensible cream shift dress, along with a navy jacket and pearls, and looks rather more matronly than her girlish, carefully curated selfies – she has perfected the art of the doe eye and dropped chin – would suggest. But the voice, the views, and the rhino hide as far as criticism is concerned, feel authentic. She is a devoted Catholic, plays the violin and the piano, and makes a legendary Sunday roast. She and Simon have been together seven years. They met after he separated from his first wife, by whom he also has two children. However, the pair did not divorce until Karen was pregnant with Milton. Two images for which Mrs Danczuk, the wife of Rochdale MP Simon Danczuk, has been criticised . I would like to ask: ‘So Karen, what first attracted you, a Labour activist with political ambitions, to the town’s much-admired MP?’ But I can’t because he wasn’t an MP back then and she wasn’t a councillor. Or even on Twitter. And he was only her second serious boyfriend. ‘I was never fussed about men, I was too independent,’ she says. ‘We met – corny – at Rochdale Labour Club, went for a drink and clicked. When I found out I was pregnant I was in shock for nine months.’ They married two years ago. Twitter is what Karen does to relax. She’s been on it for two years but it was a cheeky selfie of her eating a bacon sandwich after the Ed Miliband bacon buttie disaster which led newspapers and political gossip websites to her Twitter feed. ‘I love Twitter – it’s a creative way of expressing who we are and what we do,’ she says. ‘I don’t plan my selfies, they’re taken in the moment. I’ve no intention of changing myself – I’d be letting myself down. What you see in those photos, that’s me. I’m more than an MP’s wife, I’m also a businesswoman and a mum.’ The question is: does she want to be an MP too? ‘Will I go down that route? Maybe in ten years’ time. But I’m not a career politician. I do this [local politics in Rochdale] because I care. I’m more than capable but I have two small boys, and I can’t just up and leave them.’ Ten years will give her time to mature politically because, as she admits, ‘right now I float around in my views. I’m Labour for ever but the party needs a firmer vision, clearer policies. Because we are not clear, even I can’t tell you what I agree and disagree with’. However, she goes on to demand a cap on immigration and a review of the party’s commitment to the minimum wage. Ten years will also give her time to post a lot more selfies. Do I think she has the chutzpah to be an MP? Definitely. Would I want her as mine? No, but give her time. Karen Danczuk’s greatest political skill thus far has been reflecting herself well in the hall of mirrors that is social media. I prefer my politicians to be more substantial. And I don’t mean in their bra size.","Rochdale MP wife criticised for showing cleavage in Twitter pictures .

'There were many times on the air in recent years where I nearly said that I'm transgender,' she said.

'From the minute I woke up to the minute I went to sleep it was always there. 'The thought was there in my head constantly.' Hirst said: 'I'd drive home in the car - I'd be driving home on the M1 and, honestly, I could have just turned the wheel to the central reservation. I didn't of course. Or I would scream. 'I remember sitting in my kitchen rocking backwards and forwards going ""just make this stop, go away, leave me alone"" and I felt like she was eating me up inside.' Asked how listeners would react, she said: 'I'm just me, I'm the same person. 'I'm not going to flounce around in flowery dresses all day. I'm just me, I'm just a human being, I still love people, still care for people the same way - nothing changes.

"It's the age old question that most woman are dying to find the answer to.... does bread really make you fat? Australian women it seems are choosing to believe what they hear, or the so called myths, about consuming bread in their daily diet, with a number steering clear of the carb. New research has found that in fact 43 per cent of woman avoid eating bread when trying to lose weight, 20 per cent feel guilty when they eat bread, while more than half of women find the healthy bread category overwhelming and confusing. Scroll down for video . Mmmmm carbs! New research has revealed that bread isn't the cause of weight gain or bloating although 43 per cent of woman avoid eating bread when trying to lose weight . The national study of more than 1,000 women aged between 25 and 65 taken on behalf of popular bakery, Bakers Delight, is aiming to bust those bread myths and change attitudes towards eating bread. Once seen as a relatively healthy part of our diets, bread these days is getting a bad wrap, touted as the reason why we gain weight, blamed for putting on the bloat, while the gluten used in bread is being seen as the all round bad guy. The research also found that more than a third of Aussie women indicated they are looking for healthier bread options with 65 per cent believing information about healthier bread alternatives should be more accessible. Parents are also limiting their kids' bread intake with 15 per cent of Aussie mums cutting back because they don't want them to get overweight. The statistics : National survey of more than 1,000 Australian women has busted some of the myths about eating bread . While some women avoid bread, there's no denying they can't resist bread for it's taste, the survey revealing a high 83 per cent of women eat it because it is delicious . Nutritionist and health expert, Sharon Natoli of Food and Nutrition Australia says since Dr Atkins published his new ‘Diet Revolution’ in the 1990’s and other low carb fad diets quickly followed, it has created a stigma associated with eating carbs. She says the survey results were reflective of current nutritional debates which continue to fuel uncertainty around healthy bread options. 'It reflects a loss of basic nutritional knowledge around healthy bread options,' she said. 'Many women are unaware of the long list of benefits offered by wholemeal and low GI breads, and often gluten free diets can be more harmful than good in terms of increased sugar levels.' 'The right bread choice can offer numerous health benefits including digestive health, sustained energy and an all round healthier heart mind and body,' said Ms Natoli. She says there's no evidence on its own that contributes to weight gain. 'Large studies of populations show that people who have higher intakes of whole grain foods, such as whole grain breads, are less likely to be overweight or gain weight over time. 'Many women are unaware of the significant nutritional benefits of wholegrain bread including fibre, B vitamins, magnesium and iron,' she said. 'Large studies of populations show that people who have higher intakes of whole grain foods, such as whole grain breads, are less likely to be overweight or gain weight over time, ' according to nutritionist and health expert Sharon Natoli . More info please! Women say they want more information to make the right choice on what bread to buy according to their needs and lifestyle . Ms Natoli agrees it very important for every consumer to have access to all the information they need to make the right choice when buying bread to make their needs and lifestyle. 'Kids may benefit from bread that provides omega 3s along with the usual benefits of fibre and B vitamins while people concerned about heart health may prefer a bread that is high in seeds and wholegrains. 'There are many different breads on the market so understanding your needs and matching this with the benefits of the loaf is important,' she said. 'Bread is a food that national health authorities recommend daily as part of a healthy, balanced diet due to its important contribution to nutrient intakes, so there is no reason to feel guilty about eating bread.' 'While some people can find bread contributes to bloat, it is important not to mistake this for other causes of bloating and have these investigated first, before cutting bread out of your diet,' she said. Can't resist a slice! Despite some Aussie women cutting back on bread because of myths that it causes weight gain, on average they eat bread about five times a week . A case study of 42 year old mother of two, Angela, also found that ditching the carbs won't make much of a difference. She completely cut out bread from her diet for a while but reported seeing no difference in her weight and felt no less bloated. Despite those shying away from bread, research tells us that a number of Aussie women are still happy to munch down on carbs, with on average, women eating bread at least five times a week. And there's no denying most can't resist bread for it's taste, the survey revealing a high 83 per cent of women eat it because it is delicious. And there's also the convenience factor of quickly putting together a sandwich or chucking it in the toaster, 73 per cent admitted they eat bread because it is convenient.","New research reveals bread isn't the cause of weight gain .

"Sir Andrew Green, a leading opponent of mass immigration to Britain, is to become a peer. David Cameron personally nominated the chairman of MigrationWatch for a seat in the House of Lords as a crossbencher for his public service as a former diplomat and for his role in the immigration debate. The appointment comes amid a growing public clamour for tighter controls on immigration, with Mr Cameron promising to impose curbs on EU migrants as part of his plan to claw powers back from Brussels. Sir Andrew Green, chairman of MigrationWatch, is to join the House of Lords as a crossbench peer . MigrationWatch is a think tank which campaigns against Britain's open borders with Europe, warning levels of immigration are unsustainable. Three other people will also become crossbench peers. They include former MI5 boss Sir Jonathan Evans and education expert Professor Alison Wolf. One appointment which is likely to raise eyebrows in Westminster is that of Sir Robert Rogers, who this year quit as the clerk to the Commons after reports of rows with Speaker John Bercow. However, Sir Andrew's elevation to the Lords at a time when immigration is dominating political debate is likely to prove the most controversial. He co-founded the MigrationWatch think tank in 2001, after a career as a diplomat in the civil service, retiring in 2000 after four years a Britain's ambassador to Saudi Arabia. He has become a leading voice against immigration and a supporter of Mr Cameron's promise to cut net migration to the tens of thousands. The official citation for Sir Andrew states: 'Sir Andrew Green KCMG was the British Ambassador to Syria from 1991 to 1994, and to Saudi Arabia, 1996 to 2000. 'He served for over 35 years in the Diplomatic Service. Since retirement in 2000, he has carried out a wide range of voluntary work. This includes MigrationWatch UK which he co-founded in 2001 and still chairs.' The decision to reward such an outspoken opponent of mass immigration comes as Mr Cameron is in the grip of a major row with the EU over attempts to curb freedom of movement. Former MI5 boss Sir Jonathan Evans also becomes a crossbench peer in the list announced today . Former Commons clerk Sir Robert Rogers and education expert Alison Wolf also become peers . The Premier has pledged to put immigration 'at the very heart' of his renegotiation strategy for Europe, which he has promised before staging an in-out referendum by 2017. The Tories promised to cut net migration to the tens of thousands, but latest figures show it has topped 200,000. Sir Andrew has warned that 'immigration on this scale is simply not sustainable'. He has urged the government to consider 'what reforms can be made to Freedom of Movement in the EU, so as to limit the number of low skilled EU migrants coming to the UK, at least until migratory pressures abate.' Senior Conservatives are considering a proposal to impose quote on 'time-limited national insurance numbers' to limit the numbers of people able to move to Britain for work. But outgoing European Commission president Jose Manuel Barroso has warned restricting migrant numbers would 'not be in conformity with European laws'. As Prime Minister, Mr Cameron personally nominates crossbench peers to the Queen in recognition of their public service. The number of appointments covered under this arrangement is a maximum of 10 in any one Parliament, Downing Street said.","Prime Minister personally nominates appointment to the Queen .

"The parents of the model shot dead by Oscar Pistorius have attacked the 'volatile' and 'trigger-happy' athlete saying 'sooner or later he would have killed someone'. They have sat through an agonising seven-month trial, but June and Barry Steenkamp said justice for their daughter Reeva, 29, has not been served as the 'Blade Runner' could be out in 10 months. Mrs Steenkamp, 68, said she did not believe the athlete's story, describing him as 'vague, evasive and shifty' after he claimed  he shot Reeva thinking she was an intruder. 'It was Reeva's bad luck that she met him, because sooner or later he would have killed someone. I do believe that,' she said in an interview with The Times Magazine. Scroll down for video . June and Barry Steenkamp said justice for their daughter Reeva, 29, has not been served as Pistorius could be out in 10 months . 'I wasn't happy with the sentence at all. I don't think that was justice for Reeva at all.' They have a recurring image of Reeva, terrified and alone in the small toilet cubicle, pleading for her life or screaming in agony once she had been shot. 'Both of us are haunted by the same nightmare. The vision of Reeva suffering this terrible trauma. Her terror and helplessness. Her yells for help piercing the silent night air,' said Mrs Steenkamp. Her husband imagines her begging for her life. 'He agonises over what was going through her mind: 'Where is anyone? Who is going to save me?' ' Mrs Steenkamp said she he did not believe Oscar Pistorius' story, describing him as 'vague, evasive and shifty' after he claimed he shot Reeva (left) thinking she was an intruder . Pistorius told the court they were planning a life together, but Mrs Steenkamp thinks Reeva had 'nagging doubts about their compatibility'. 'She had confided to me that she hadn't slept with him. They'd shared a bed, but she was scared to take the relationship to that level … She wouldn't want to sleep with Oscar if she wasn't sure,' she said. 'I believe their relationship was coming to an end. In her heart of hearts, she didn't think it was making either of them happy.' In her book, titled Reeva: A Mother's Story, Mrs Steenkamp describes Pistorius, 27, as a 'pathetic figure'. Her parents have a recurring image of Reeva, terrified and alone in the small toilet cubicle, pleading for her life or screaming in agony once she had been shot, pictured as a toddler (left) and during a family Christmas . The extract focuses on the athlete's public apology during the televised trial. 'It was an extraordinary moment. You could cut the atmosphere in the courtroom with a knife: silence, but for the sound of journalists tapping on their screens. It put me in an awkward position. 'Why decide to say sorry to me in a televised trial in front of the whole world? I was unmoved by his apology. I felt if I appeared to be sorry for him at this stage of his trial on the charge of premeditated murder, it would in the eyes of others lessen the awfulness of what he had done. 'He was in the box trying to save his own skin after he had killed my daughter and I was sitting in that courtroom wanting to hear the factual truth.' The model (centre) with her brother Adam and mother June (right) who has written about her daughter's death in her book titled: Reeva: A Mother's Story . Pistorius told the court they were planning a life together, but Mrs Steenkamp thinks Reeva had 'nagging doubts about their compatibility' Miss Steenkamp's parents said their daughter's death in the early hours of Valentine's Day last year remained shrouded in mystery, and 'only Oscar knows' the truth . The five-year sentence given to the double amputee athlete has been criticised by some as too lenient. But Miss Steenkamp's parents told ITV's Good Morning Britain they accepted the sentence and 'don't want revenge'. They said their daughter's death in the early hours of Valentine's Day last year remained shrouded in mystery, and 'only Oscar knows' the truth. Judge Thokozile Masipa ruled the state had failed to prove Pistorius knew it was Reeva when he opened fire through the locked toilet door of his apartment in Pretoria. Throughout the trial, he said he mistook his girlfriend of three months for an intruder. 'He said pulling the trigger was 'an accident'. What? Four times an accident?' Mrs Steenkamp said in her book. 'He said Reeva did not scream, but she would definitely have screamed. I know my daughter and she was very vocal.' Pistorius, who the court heard has no income and no property after selling it during the trial, was driven away in a police van with barred windows after his sentencing on Tuesday. He is expected to be held in the hospital section of a prison in Pretoria. Mrs Steenkamp's book is to be published on November 6.

"It is a hammer blow for Fulham fans. Felix Magath has declared that he wouldn’t sign Brazilian superstar Neymar, even if he had the chance to get him for free. Despite the club playing Championship football next season, Magath sees no role at Craven Cottage for one of the best players in the world. The Fulham manager appeared on Germany’s major TV channel ZDF after Argentina’s victory over Switzerland, to give his own expert view on the World Cup. Talking to former Bayern Munich star Hasan Salihamidaic, the German coach said that he didn’t like players like Neymar. VIDEO scroll down to watch Thomas Muller leading Germany's training . Star of the show: Neymar has been one of Brazil's key men - but he would not get in Felix Magath's team . Going alone: Neymar scores a lot of individual goals - according to Magath . 'I like team players. Players like Neymar, where it’s all about the individual scoring goals... I don’t know,' said Magath, before breaking into sheepish grin, 'I probably wouldn’t even take him for free'. Salihamidaic’s reaction was one of visible shock, and the Bosnian couldn’t help but burst out laughing. Even as a tongue-in-cheek remark, it was a bold claim from Magath, who faces the mammoth task of reshaping Fulham’s squad for the Championship following their relegation in May. Team player: Magath is a fan of players like Germany's Thomas Muller . Midfield master: Magath is also a fan of Bastian Schweinsteiger . He did offer optimistic Fulham fans a glimmer of hope though, saying: 'If Neymar wins the World Cup with Brazil, then maybe I’d consider it.' Happily for the Craven Cottage faithful, Magath’s infamous love of the transfer market has not disappeared entirely. Asked which World Cup stars he would like to bring to Fulham, Magath said he thought Manuel Neuer had been outstanding, and that he’d always welcome Thomas Muller. With those two transfers under his belt, perhaps Fulham wouldn’t even need Neymar to guarantee promotion next season. Making his mark: Magath will look to lead Fulham back to the Premer League at the first attempt . Magath was also full of praise for Bastian Schweinsteiger, saying he was the 'right man' for Germany’s midfield. He claimed that the Bayern Munich player was a superior choice to Real Madrid’s Sami Khedira. 'Khedira can’t play the same leading role at the moment,' he said. The Fulham boss then laid into Germany coach Joachim Low, saying that he had to stop playing captain Phillipp Lahm in midfield. 'Phillipp wants to play there, but it’s not about that. It’s about the team. For this team, he is more urgently needed as a left back. Benedikt Hoewedes can’t fulfil that role properly at the moment'.

"Warning: Lord Robert Winston, the geneticist and Labour peer, said there was a ‘risk’ the new Bill could lead to treatments which could do harm to people rather than improving their lives . Plans to allow terminally-ill patients to be given untested treatments without proper safeguards were branded ‘dangerous’ by a top scientist last night. Lord Robert Winston, the geneticist and Labour peer, said there was a ‘risk’ it could lead to treatments which could do harm to people rather than improving their lives. But another peer, Lord Blencathra, who has multiple sclerosis, made an impassioned plea for the law to be changed, saying he was willing to try innovative jobs which could improve his quality of life. Lord Maurice Saatchi, the former marketing expert for Margaret Thatcher, has introduced a Bill in the House of Lords aimed at allowing some people dying of cancer to be voluntarily treated with unlicensed drugs. It gained government backing earlier this week after further safeguards were proposed requiring doctors to get the agreement of another specialist in prescribing drugs. But the medical and legal professions are divided over the measure and the Tory advertising mogul faces an uphill struggle with nearly 40 amendments tabled to the Medical Innovation Bill. Lord Saatchi has been campaigning for law changes to enable more innovation in treatment since his wife, novelist Josephine Hart, died from a form of ovarian cancer in 2011. Yesterday, he denied that the legislation could give comfort to ‘quacks or cowboys’ and insisted that with the new safeguards it would provide greater certainty to doctors, helping them to innovate. The Bill would give legal protection to doctors who want to try different procedures or treatments when they have exhausted other options. But Lord Winston warned that as currently drafted, the proposals would increase uncertainty and would create a lack of clarity, adding: ‘The Bill as it stands is quite a dangerous Bill.’ He said his medical career had been based on consistent innovation and Lord Saatchi was mistaken if he thought practitioners were concerned about the risk of litigation in trying new treatments. ‘The risk is that if we encourage innovation, as we are inclined to do and as is happening in private practice at the moment for quite large fees, there is a real risk in the long term,’ he said. As an example, he pointed to the decision of two internet companies which have offered to freeze the eggs of their employees to try to delay their childbearing. This could lead to the risk of high blood pressure, heart disease, osteoporosis or dementia among older mums who take up the offer and have children late in life. Labour’s Lord Turnberg, a former professor of medicine, warned the Bill as currently drafted left open ‘to too great a degree the potential for harm by unorthodox, unregulated practitioners’ and called for the safeguards to be tightened. Backing: Lord Maurice Saatchi (right), the former marketing expert for Margaret Thatcher, has introduced a Bill aimed at allowing some people dying of cancer to be voluntarily treated with unlicensed drugs . Lord Saatchi said he was happy to hold talks with peers on the Bill’s provisions before the next stage of debate. ‘I am trying to deliver an Act Of Parliament which is simple, completely straightforward and totally clear - providing clarity and certainty at the point of treatment, both to the doctor and the patient, he said. Tory former minister Lord Blencathra, who suffers from multiple sclerosis, said: ‘I suspect that I am typical of many who will try any innovative treatment. I am 16 days into a treatment with a new drug, Fampridine, which is approved for use in this country but only, I think, in the national neurological hospital in the wonderful Queen Square. ‘At the moment there is no cure for MS but these innovative treatments are making life better. After just 16 days of my experimental treatment, I certainly feel a marginal improvement—at least I am not declining further. ‘That may be the only hope one can offer many people—not that we can fix them but we will make the quality of their lives better for the long term and we will try to hold the disease at bay.’","New Bill aims to allow those dying of cancer to be given unlicensed drugs .

"Having children can make you more productive at work, and the effect is especially pronounced for women. A study claims that having one or more children can makes someone a better work in the early and latter stages of their career. It was found that mothers with at least two children perform the best. Study by Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis says having children can make people more productive at work (stock image shown). They sampled nearly 10,000 men and women. Men were found to be least productive when they had one child and most productive when they had more than one . The researchers from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis in Missouri sampled about 10,000 men and women. They were examining the hypothesis that having children makes a person less productive. To make their findings the researchers sent out more than 30,000 surveys, a third of which were responded to. Work stress - and related drinking and smoking - are taking an increasing toll on their health, according to the Office for National Statistics. In 1963 men were twice as likely to die early as women. Last year however the increased risk fell to one and a half times and the life expectancy gap has fallen from six years to fewer than four. The ONS study is the first official recognition that women who have abandoned the domestic lives of their grandmothers now face the same shorter lifespans of men. ‘Ministers want women to work long hours when they have children, but these figures…indicates there may be public health problems as a result,’ said Laura Perrins of the pressure group Mothers at Home Matter. And the results showed that men with one child were similarly productive or less productive than their childless colleagues. Men with more than one child, however, were more productive than those with one or no children. For women the effect was even more pronounced; those without children were far and away less productive without a child in later life. Those with multiple children, however, seemed to be much more productive throughout their career. ‘Mothers of at least two children are, on average, more productive than mothers of only one child, and mothers in general are more productive than childless women,’ they write. ‘Fathers of at least two children are also more productive than fathers of one child and childless men.’ The Washington Post notes that the authors were examining a narrow group of men and women, in this case somewhat ‘privileged’ economists. However, the age of children was also important. There was a 15 to 17 per cent drop in productivity for women with young kids. But once the children had grown up, it seemed productivity levels would increase. The results showed that men (left graph) with one child were similarly productive or less productive than their childless colleagues. Men with more than one child, however, were more productive than those with one or no children. For women (right graph) the effect was even more pronounced .","Study by Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis in Missouri says having children can make people more productive at work .

"More than half of voters think the Lib Dems are irrelevant, as latest polls show barely three per cent of people will definitely vote for Nick Clegg at the next election. The Lib Dem leader issued a rallying cry to activists today, warning they have the 'fight of our lives' ahead to prevent wipeout in May 2015. One former minister, Jeremy Browne, branded the Lib Dems the political equivalent of struggling supermarket chain Morrisons. But in the conference hall in Glasgow delegates appeared to be looking for divine intervention, pictured apparently praying in the auditorium. Lib Dem supporters, including Vince Cable (top row, second left) and Danny Alexander (bottom row, second left) appeared to be looking for divine intervention in Glasgow today . Pollsters ComRes  found 56 per cent of people think the Lib Dems have become irrelevant, while just 26 per cent disagree, in a survey for ITV News . A new ComRes poll for ITV News found 56 per cent of people think the Lib Dems have become irrelevant, while just 26 per cent disagree. Just 14 per cent trust Mr Clegg to keep the promises he makes while 63 per cent believe the Lib Dem leader will break his pledges. Some 44 per cent of adults believe it was a mistake for the party to go into Coalition with the Conservatives in 2010 and 42 per cent feel betrayed by Nick Clegg. But ousting the Deputy Prime Minister and replacing him with a new leader would mean just 18 per cent are more likely to vote for the Liberal Democrats. More voters, however, still give the Liberal Democrats credit for raising of the personal tax allowance to £10,000 at 30 per cent compared to 22 per cent for the Conservatives. In a separate poll by Lord Ashcroft, just 7 per cent of people say they plan to vote Lib Dem next year, . Of those, just a third - or 2.2 per cent of all voters - say they will definitely vote for Mr Clegg's party. Overall, the Tories are ahead on 32 per cent - after their successful conference last week - with Labour on 30 per cent. UKIP are on 17 per cent, with the Greens on 7 per cent - the same as the Lib Dems. The ComRes poll also revealed that just a third of the public think it was not a mistake for the Lib Dems to enter into Coalition with the Tories . The public still distrust the Deputy Prime Minister over his broken election promise not to increase student fees . The Lib Dems are languishing in fourth place in the polls - equal with the Greens, but behind UKP . Today Mr Clegg played down his party's struggles in the polls. He told ITV's Good Morning Britain: ' 'I've literally lost count of the times, with the greatest respect, that I've been asked questions saying 'oh isn't it going to be a disaster? Aren't you going to be wiped out? Isn't it all going to be terrible?' And every time we confound the sceptics and I genuinely think we will do so next year. 'Not because I'm being somehow naïve about this – of course this has been tough for us over the last few years. 'But because I experience this in my own constituency in south-west Sheffield – and speaking to my friends and colleagues here, we all experience the same – when we get out and tell our side of the story and say that it's because of us the economy is now growing again. 'It's because of us people have got more money in their pockets because we've given fair tax cuts to people on low and middle incomes, it's because of us there are more apprenticeships than ever before, it's because of us the state pension has gone up by the largest cash terms ever, and so on and so forth – the more we explain our side of the story and what we've done in government, the more we do get people to support us in those areas where we are competing for those votes. And that's what we need to do between now and the next general election. 'I'm not a soothsayer or a pollster so you'll need to speak pollsters and soothsayers about what they think the future will hold. All I can tell you is what I believe, what our values are and the pride that I have in what we've done over the last four and a half years.' Nick Clegg changed into casual chinos and a dark shirt for a Q&A at the Lib Dem conference in Glasgow this afternoon . Party activists appeared less than enthralled by the day's debate at the SECC arena on the banks of the River Clyde . Delegates listen to speakers at the Liberal Democrat Autumn conference - the last before May's general election . However, Mr Clegg's main conference slogan has been ridiculed by former Lib Dem minister Jeremy Browne. He branded the party the political equivalent of struggling supermarket chain Morrisons. Mr Browne said the party's positioning showed a 'fundamental misunderstanding' of the current political reality and mocked the Lib Dems' 'stronger economy, fairer society' conference slogan, repeatedly used by Mr Clegg in broadcast interviews. Voters will not be won over by a party that makes reining in others and banning things its main pitch, he told the ResPublica conference fringe. He said: 'Our slogan really is stronger economy, invisible brackets, than you would get if Labour was in government on their own, close invisible brackets. Fairer society, open invisible brackets, than you would get if the Conservatives were in government on their own, close brackets.' 'So, the very slogan of our conference is about how we would aspire to mitigate others in government, that our raison d'etre in politics is not to advance our our ideas but to retard the advancement of other people's ideas and that we will, quotes, anchor them in the centre ground, i.e., make sure people who believe something can't put actually put their beliefs forward unimpeded. 'It feels to me like we are pursuing a second vote strategy in a one preference voting system.' He added: 'I think we need a message, I don't just mean in this election but for the next 10 years, about what we believe in, what do we stand for as a party.' While UKIP and the SNP are like Aldi and Lidl, the Lib Dems are like Morrisons, he said. 'The Lib Dems are the Morrisons of our day. We have to think what are we offering the customers that goes beyond those who shop at Morrisons out of habit or because it is the nearest to their home.' 'At the moment we are heavily reliant on habit and geographic proximity.'","Poll by Lord Ashcroft shows just 7% planning to vote Lib Dem next year .

"Deirdre 'White Dee' Kelly is making up to £6,000 a night and is set to pay 40 per cent income tax just months after finding fame as a long-term welfare claimant. The 43-year-old Benefits Street star charges at least £1,500 an hour to appear at nightclubs and her manager claims she can manage four meet-and-greets a night. Now she is also being invited to student debating societies after she appeared at the Tory party conference and demanded the government do more to get people into work. And she has still not ruled out standing as an MP next year - even though it would mean a pay cut. Scroll down for video . Hey big spender: Deirdre 'White Dee' Kelly, pictured at a Stoke-on-Trent nightclub last week, makes £1,500 an hour and is set to pay 40 per cent  tax just months after life as a long-term welfare claimant made her famous . Selfie: Miss Kelly's agent Barry Tomes claimed she can be mobbed by hundreds of people wanting photos . Tonight alone, the most controversial resident of Birmingham's James Turner Street will appear at two nightclubs in Sheffield - a week after she was mobbed by revellers in Stoke-on-Trent. Her manager Barry Tomes told MailOnline: 'She usually goes for an hour and sits in the VIP area where she's looked after by a couple of doormen. 'Last week we had one where 200 or 300 people queued up to meet her and it took us 45 minutes just to get from the car into the venue. 'Her minimum fee is £1,500 an hour and for a big awards ceremony for example - unless it's for charity - that could double. 'Last week she presented a footballing award and next week she's presenting an award at an Asian community event.' Well-known: The resident of Birmingham's James Turner Street shot into the headlines on C4's Benefits Street . Long road travelled: This week she appeared at the Tory conference and has been invited to student debates . The mother-of-two shot into headlines in January for her bullish appearances on Channel 4's controversial fly-on-the-wall show Benefits Street. When she appeared on the documentary her last full-time job had been at Birmingham City Council - from which she was fired in 2007, and narrowly avoided a jail sentence, for stealing £13,000. She was immediately controversial when she was shown swearing repeatedly at her children and having little motivation to search for a job after years of unemployment. Change of heart: She said it was 'not fair' for benefits claimints to earn more than minimum-wage workers . In the months after Benefits Street she began cashing in on her notoriety, flying to Magaluf where she downed shots with punters while still claiming sickness benefits. She then stopped claiming state handouts in May, and has since built a career around her status as a TV personality. The mother-of-two appeared on Celebrity Big Brother and will feature in a Channel 5 documentary on her new lifestyle from January. Mr Tomes claimed she is 'easily' earning at the 40 per cent tax rate and has often pulled in fees from several nightclubs a night - though she still makes less than big names from The Only Way is Essex. 'During the Christmas period where every nightclub wants someone we can do as many as 12 venues,' he said. 'You start with an under-16s disco and you're still doing a gay club at 3.30am.' The culmination of her unusual new life came on Monday when she appeared at a fringe event at the Tory party conference - and admitted the life she had boasted of living previously was 'unfair'. She said: 'It's not fair that someone works a 40-hour, if not more, week and doesn't have as much to live on as someone who sits at home, doesn't work and is given money from the Government. 'But that's not that individual's fault, that is the Government's fault. I think the Government also has to look at (the) minimum wage and things like that. 'It's the Government that says how much someone is entitled to to live on, not the individual.' She also laid in to government policy, saying: 'I have experienced some not very nice job centres,' she said. 'You do just go in, you sit down, you are looked down upon. 'They just need to understand that, just because you are on benefits does not mean that you are not a real person. Just because you are on benefits doesn't mean that you are not physically looking for a job.' Big ambitions: The 43-year-old has still not ruled out standing as an MP - even though it would earn her less . Asked about the welfare changes introduced since 2010, she said: 'I have noticed a change. I think it's considerably got worse.' Miss Kelly has still not ruled out standing as an MP next year, despite reports that she no longer wants to because she earns more as a 'celebrity'. 'I've said she should put it on the back burner for ten years because she wouldn't be able to be as outspoken or do as many appearances', Mr Tomes said. 'Why would she want to be an MP on £60,000 when she would be very restricted on what she would be doing? 'But she's a strong-willed woman so she won't necessarily listen to me.' Almost 900 viewers complained to Ofcom after Benefits Street was aired. Many of them  said the residents had been misrepresented, children were exploited and the show was 'poverty porn' which demonised those on benefits. In a lengthy decision, the regulator  ruled there had been no breach of the broadcasting code.","Deirdre Kelly, 43, enjoyed huge boost to her profile at Tory conference .

"Sean Price, 56, (pictured outside Newcastle Crown Court), was dismissed from Cleveland Police in 2012 . A chief constable who became the first police chief to be sacked in 35 years has told a court he cannot repay £500,000 his former bosses claim he should never have been paid because he no longer has the money. Sean Price, 56, was dismissed from his position at Cleveland Police in October 2012 for gross misconduct. The force's Police and Crime Commissioner Barry Coppinger is now suing him for the payment which was part of a 'golden handcuffs' deal to keep him in post prior to the scandal. The civil claim, which is expected to last two weeks and will take place in March, comes after the force said he should never have been paid the money. Following a preliminary hearing before Mr Justice Coulson at Newcastle Crown Court, Mr Price told reporters the move was vindictive, that Mr Coppinger had been party to agreeing the payments when he was a member of Cleveland Police Authority, and that the case was a waste of public money. Police authorities were replaced by PCCs' offices following elections in 2012. Outside court, he said: 'It is a real irony that Barry Coppinger was one of the people who authorised those payments to me because they wanted me to stay in Cleveland Police, and it is now he that has tried to get the money back. 'I look forward to it. 'I don't think it is lawful what they are trying to do, but a court is going to have to hear it.' He referred to the £5million cost of Operation Sacristy which looked at allegations of corruption in the force, and led to no-one being prosecuted. 'This feels like vindictiveness, ""we need to win this whatever it takes"", and I have done nothing wrong. 'I haven't got the money and this is a further waste of public money.' Mr Price, who is representing himself in court, claimed the cost to the public so far in legal fees was £50,000. 'Imagine how much a two-week trial is going to cost,' he added.

"Mexico coach Miguel Herrera will allow his players a small celebration after what he regarded as one of the best days of his life.

"It is a deadly virus that has so far claimed the lives of more than 3,400 people. So, when the Jacksonville Jaguars' mascot made a joke about Ebola, he sparked a storm of criticism. The mascot, who has played the role of Jaxson de Ville for 20 seasons, commented on the disease, which recently infected an NBC cameraman, during the game against the Pittsburgh Steelers in Florida yesterday. Referring to Steelers' fans' iconic 'Terrible Towels', he held up a handwritten sign reading: 'Towels carry Ebola', while carrying one of the yellow towels in his right hand. Under fire: The Jacksonville Jaguars' mascot, dubbed Jaxson de Ville, sparked a storm of criticism with this sign reading: 'Towels carry Ebola'.

Today, the Jaguars apologized for the sign, which was created and held up by Jaxon de Ville during the fourth quarter of the game at Everbank Field, which the team lost 17-9. According to ESPN, Curtis Dvorak, who has worn the yellow-and-blue suit for nearly 20 seasons, is believed to have been wearing it at the time. 'Improvisation and humor have both been key elements to the character of Jaxson de Ville, especially when he performs at home games,' the Jaguars' president Mark Lamping said. 'On Sunday, the person who has played Jaxson de Ville over the past 20 seasons made an extremely poor decision in that regard.

The midfielder will wear red instead of blue on his next visit to Goodison Park as he bids to claim victory against the team he grew up supporting as a boy. But Lallana isn't the only Evertonian to have plied his trade at Anfield. Here Sportsmail takes a look at how six other stars got on after crossing the Stanley Park divide.

Born in St Albans but choosing to support Everton like his father, Lallana used to go along to Goodison Park with his Dad and watched the likes of Duncan Ferguson and Neville Southall star for the Toffees as the club won the FA Cup in 1995. However, the England international admits the club's glory days were in the past when he became a fan. 'Dad used to reminisce about the good old days when Everton won the old first division championship and the FA Cup back in the 1970s and 80s but they weren’t quite so good when I started supporting them,' he said.

Having once described himself as 'the biggest Blue in Bootle', Jamie Carragher ended up playing over 500 league games for the red half of Merseyside. However the former centre back and Sportsmail columnist has freely admitted the love he had for the Toffees growing up. 'I was a total Everton fanatic right through my childhood and teens,' Carragher said in 2008. 'Everton controlled my life and dominated my thoughts 24/7. I went to the away games, followed them across Europe and in the mid-80s went to Wembley so often it began to feel like Alton Towers.

Following Michael Thomas' last-gasp winner which denied Liverpool the 1989 First Division title, an 11-year-old Carragher applauded lads who scrawled 'Thank You Arsenal' on the wall of a Bootle pub. During the defender's Liverpool testimonial against the Toffees in 2010, Carragher scored for both sides - the Reds legend hijacking Yakubu's penalty to score an 'own goal' from the spot.

Born in St Asaph in Wales, boyhood Everton fan Ian Rush joined Liverpool from Chester City in 1980 and went on to score nearly 250 league goals for the club. Ask any Blue about the Welshman and they'll probably roll their eyes before admitting most of those strikes probably came against Everton!

Wind up: Rush pretended he'd signed for Everton as part of a Shoot magazine April Fool's Day prank in 1989 . ROBBIE FOWLER . Given the nickname 'God' by the Anfield faithful, Robbie Fowler grew up as an Everton fan before joining Liverpool's academy at age 11. The deadly striker, who scored 183 goals for the Reds during two spells at the club, even turned down a move to Goodison Park as a teenager after falling in love with his surroundings. In an interview with Goal.com in 2009, Fowler said: 'When I was very young I used to watch them (Everton) but I was at Liverpool when I was 11 years old – I’ve been a Liverpool fan from then on.

'At that time it would have been easier to get into the Everton first team but I stuck to my guns and am happy with decision I made!' Legend: Fowler went on to score 183 goals for Liverpool after avoiding the temptation to move to Goodison Park . MICHAEL OWEN . After his father Terry started his career with Everton in the mid-sixties, Michael Owen grew up supporting the Toffees. As a youngster, when having a kick-about with his Dad, Owen would pretend to be former Everton frontman Gary Lineker. Shortly after starting high school, Chelsea, Arsenal, Manchester United and Liverpool all showed an interest in Owen, and, despite being a Blue, the striker decided to join the Reds. The frontman went on to become one of the Premier League's most-lethal finishers and burst onto the scene by scoring on his Liverpool debut against Wimbledon in May 1997.

In a 2004 interview with Four Four Two, Mcmanaman said: 'When I was younger I was desperate to sign for Everton but they weren't as forthcoming as Liverpool. For a young player, 15 years old, your chances were so much better at Liverpool. 'I think that when I was about signing age Liverpool's youth policy was much better than Everton's.' McManaman was such a big Blue that during Liverpool training if he ever found the net with his head the wideman would shout 'Latchford!' after Everton legend Bob, who played up front for the Toffees during the 70s.

PS - And what about these two... STEVEN GERRARD . After a photo emerged of Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard wearing a full Everton kit and posing with the club's trophies as a youngster, arguments ensued across Merseyside about whether or not the Reds' talisman actually grew up a Blue. However, it transpired that after Everton had won the First Division in 1987, Gerrard’s uncle Leslie took Stevie - then . seven - to Goodison Park to have his photo taken with the trophy and . the Charity Shield. Leslie even bought his nephew a new Everton kit for . the photo shoot. Rather amusingly, Everton fans often joke that the photo is the closest Gerrard has ever got to the title! True Blue? Steven Gerrard was dressed in Everton kit to have his picture taken with the First Division trophy and Charity Shield in 1987 . WAYNE ROONEY . Rumour has it Liverpool offered a trial to Wayne Rooney before his beloved Blues spotted him. The staunch Toffee - who was once a mascot at a Merseyside derby - did accept Liverpool's offer but insisted on wearing his full Everton kit. Eventually ending up at Goodison Park, the frontman went on to live the dream and marked his arrival in an Everton shirt by scoring that goal against Arsenal in 2002 aged just 16. However, having once famously revealed a shirt which read 'Once a Blue, Always a Blue', Rooney eventually went on to play in red when he joined Manchester United in 2004.

"For a while it seemed like Novak Djokovic was done, another big seed facing a big loss. He was startlingly poor for two sets, slipping and sliding and whingeing and dropping points. Then he changed his shoes and fortunes. Sometimes the simple solutions are best. With new footwear he looked like a different player to the one who had followed a 6-1 first-set win by losing the next two 6-3, 7-6. He promptly blitzed the fourth set 6-2 and then the third 6-2 to see off the 26th seed and set-up an intriguing semi-final against Grigor Dimitrov, who crushed Andy Murray so emphatically earlier in the day. Nervy: But Novak Djokovic did come out on top against Marin Cilic in a five-set thriller at Wimbledon . Respect: The Croatian 26th seed pushed him all the way on Court No 1 . Fan favourite: The top seed salutes to the crowd following his victory . Uncomfortable: Djokovic was two sets to one down at one stage, and seemed to be all at sea . Not his day: It was a frustrating day at the office for Djokovic on Court No 1 on Wednesday . Getting away from him: Djokovic stretches to return a shot to Cilic . But this was exceedingly hard work. At . one stage, Djokovic was so tetchy that the outside noise caused by that . Centre Court match was visibly bothering him. He waited between points, . huffing and puffing and staring at the umpire. For . sure, much of the frustration would have been born in his own . performance. This was often rusty, uncharacteristic tennis from such a . supremely talented athlete. To . think it was all looking so easy early on. Djokovic charged through the . first set, breaking twice as Cilic fell victim to his nerves. At . one stage, the Croat attempted a backhand from the back of the court . and it barely reached the net, so misjudged was his power. Djokovic wrapped up the set 6-1 in only 27 minutes but even then was doing what he was needed and not a huge amount more. In . the second, he fell a long way short. An element of that was down to . his form slipping, a larger reason was the sudden discovery of range by . Cilic, both on serve and in the effectiveness of his forehand. From . winning only six points on his first serve in the opening set, Cilic . took 13 of 19 in the second. Out of reach: Djokovic tumbles in the third set as he attempts to return to the Croat . Physique: Djokovic returns a shot somewhat unconventionally, showing off his acrobatic side . Crucial: Cilic celebrates winning the third set, putting him 2-1 in front . He . broke for 3-1 and quickly raced to 5-2. Djokovic had his moments, . playing a sublime point at 2-5, 30-30, when he sucked Cilic into the net . and then played a delicious lob. But Cilic, occasionally questionable . under duress, held it together with some big forehands. He served out . the set for 6-3. The . 26th seed broke for 6-5 in the third and then gave it straight back, . farcically dropping the first point of his service game by hitting the . net with his racket on a routine smash. The tiebreak was then a calamity . of errors, both players trading mini-breaks before Djokovic put a . backhand long for 7-4 Cilic. Two . early breaks put Djokovic in command of the third set, not to mention a . new pair of shoes after several slips. He closed the set 6-2 at the . first time of asking with a service winner. Goran Ivanisevic, Cilic’s . coach, stopped smiling. From . there, Djokovic closer resembled his usual self. He broke in the first . game of the decider – crucially the top seed found his range on his . backhand – and at one stage won 14 straight points on serve. He got a . second break and, arguably, a second chance in these Championships. Upset avoided. VIDEO Wimbledon Day nine roundup .

"Mark Cavendish's Tour de France is in the balance after a dramatic crash which ended the Manxman's dreams of wearing the yellow jersey in his mother's home town of Harrogate. Cavendish separated the acromioclavicular (AC) joint between his right shoulder and collarbone when he tumbled to the tarmac after colliding with Orica GreenEdge rival Simon Gerrans around 200 metres from the line. The 29-year-old had an MRI scan on the injury on Saturday night and will make a decision on Sunday morning as to whether to continue in the Tour with his Omega Pharma-QuickStep team.

'I wanted to win today, I felt really strong and was in a great position to contest the sprint thanks to the unbelievable efforts of my team. Sorry to all the fans that came out to support - it was truly incredible.' After Cavendish tumbled to the tarmac, Marcel Kittel raced away to win the opening stage of the Tour for a second year running. Cavendish, who had been bidding for his 26th Tour de France stage win, had ridden gingerly back to the team bus holding his side before being taken away in an ambulance with his wife Peta Todd and two-year-old daughter Delilah following in a team car.

After a neutralised ride-out from Leeds to Harewood House, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry gave the Tour a royal send-off. The stage was listed as flat, but it was undulating all day in the rolling Yorkshire countryside. German Jens Voigt (Trek Factory Racing), the oldest man in the peloton at 42 and in his 17th Tour, was in the day's three-man breakaway and distanced Frenchmen Benoit Jarrier (Bretagne-Seche Environnement) and Nicolas Edet (Cofidis) on the second categorised climb, the Cote de Buttertubs. Voigt held a three-minute advantage with 70km of racing remaining and secured the polka-dot King of the Mountains jersey at the final climb of Cote de Grinton Moor before being caught by the peloton with 60km to go.

"FIFA has suspended Brazil's communications director Rodirgo Paiva from match-day duty for the remainder of the World Cup after he pushed Chile striker Mauricio Pinilla. Paiva claimed he only shoved the Chile substitute in self-defence when the teams were leaving the pitch at half-time during the last-16 tie.

The fourth match, however, is suspended for a two-year probationary period. The disciplinary panel was believed to have had access to video footage and pictures of the incident in Belo Horizonte. A scuffle broke out as the teams headed to the dressing rooms in the Mineirao Stadium, sparked by Brazil striker Fred slapping Chile striker Gary Medel on the back of the head as they walked off the pitch. Brazil media said Paiva and Chile assistant boss Sebastian Beccacece were involved in a confrontation which ended in the Brazil official punching Pinilla. Paiva told Brazilian reporters there was widespread pushing between the two squads, and said: 'It was not just me. Pinilla came towards me and I just defended myself. I reacted by pushing him.' Pinilla, who plays for Italian side Cagliari, came off the bench and nearly won the match for Chile but his shot in the last seconds of the match struck the cross-bar.

"Almost half of holidaymakers row in the car over directions, a survey suggests. Researchers found that the younger the couple the more likely they are to have an argument because traditional map-reading skills are in decline. Fifty-six per cent of couples say they squabble on holidays – with 39 per cent admitting to fighting over driving instructions. Fed up on holiday? You're not alone - almost half of couples have argued over directions on a foreign jaunt . It was worse for younger holidaymakers, with those in their 20s almost twice as likely to have a 'where are we?' row as those in their 60s (38 per cent compared to 21 per cent). The next biggest topic for an argument was disagreements over money (18 per cent) or the stress of deciding where to eat or drink (14 per cent). The survey was commissioned by comparison site TravelSupermarket promoting map-reading skills with Ordnance Survey. Bob Atkinson, of TravelSupermarket, said: ‘Exploring a country should be fun, whether you’re finding your way around a city or hitting the open road in a hire car. ‘It’s disappointing a key element of this, map reading, is the major cause of relationship strains on our holidays. With such a large number of couples are falling out with loved ones while away, we want to promote the skills of map reading and in raising this issue we are going to do just that.’ Driven to distraction: The allure of iPhones and other gadgets draws attention from traditional map-reading . The survey also found that 55 per cent of men think they are better at map reading than women. Men are also three times more likely to boast that they split up with a partner after a map-reading related argument than women. The study, by Opinium Research, was carried out last month and involved 2,003 adults. Couples are still using traditional paper maps (41 per cent) to find routes ahead of sat-navs (33 per cent) or mapping iPhone apps (17 per cent) due to the high cost of data roaming fees.","Researchers found younger couples are the most likely to argue .

"The model who stripped naked at the AFL grand final has revealed her parents were not impressed and says she will write a formal apology to league officials. Heather McCartney has blamed the free alcohol bar for her raunchy antics that shocked fans following Hawthorn's big win over the Sydney Swans on Saturday. The 26-year-old Scottish model told Seven News: 'We were just playing around and everyone was betting silly things so I decided to bet, if Hawthorn win, then I'll get naked.' After receiving complaints, police arrived to arrest the Gold Coast woman but she lashed out, kicking, punching and biting the officers as they tried to handcuff her. Scroll down for video . Heather McCartney (left) donning a Hawthorn scarf before she danced naked in full view (right) of strangers during the game's final quarter at AFL Grand Final in Melbourne on Saturday . McCartney, who has over 250,000 fans on Facebook, was a last-minute guest with a friend in a corporate box on Saturday. Seven News reports that McCartney threw her underwear out the window when Tom Jones was performing before the match. Shortly after the final siren, she took off her dress and performed a naked display of celebration, which she now admits was a big mistake after she woke up on the floor of a police cell. 'I just pretty much went up to the window, turned around, walked away and put it back on,' she said. 'People around me were in absolute shock.' Heather McCartney, who models as 'Eva Darling, posing up in lingerie and a Queensland Maroons jersey . McCartney said she and her new media manager Ricky Nixon will deliver the handwritten letters of apology to the Melbourne Cricket Club and the AFL on Friday. 'I'm going to write to Gillon McLachlan and Mark Anderson, saying 'I'm sorry',' she told Seven News. 'I'm sorry for any conflict and embarrassment I've caused them and everyone.' McCartney also added that she had to apologise to her parents who live on the Gold Coast. 'They're not impressed, put it that way,' she said. Tom Steinfort tweeted a photo of Heather McCartney, naked in a corporate box at the MCG, captioning the snap: 'Celebrating your team winning the grand final by getting nude in a corporate box... priceless' Melbourne Cricket Ground and the AFL have launched an investigation. A representative from the building company denied hiring Ms McCartney as the AFL announced they were investigating the incident. 'Edgeton Properties did not hire a stripper to perform in a corporate suite at the MCG Grand Final,' the company told the newspaper in an email. It's not yet known if the company was using the corporate box during Saturday's game, or if it had leased it out. The company would not comment on who was using the corporate box  and how Ms McCartney came to be naked when the game ended. Ms McCartney denies being a stripper and claims she was dared to strip off if the Hawks won. The AFL fan has also been revealed to be a rugby league supporter, although it is unknown whether she will support the Rabbitohs or the Bulldogs during this weekend's NRL grand final . It comes as several photos emerged of Ms McCartney in various sporting attire, with the model posting several racy snaps of herself online wearing a Queensland NRL State of Origin jersey. Other photos show her wearing a Socceroos jersey, various Australian-themed swimsuits, baseball themed shoots and most recently, both Sydney Swans and Hawthorn Hawks-themed lingerie ahead of her notorious antics. Ms McCartney was arrested by police following complaints at the MCG. She reportedly lashed out by kicking, bunching and biting the officers as they tried to handcuff her. The 26-year-old was photographed being led away by police where she spent the night in a cell and was fined $300 for indecent manner. She told a Melbourne court the following day that it was a bet. Ms McCartney was seen leaving court on Sunday morning, holding a clear plastic bag of her belongings, including her clothes, shoes and make up. She was wearing black tights and a dark grey knitted jumper and had no shoes on at the time.

Ms McCartney posted a raunchy photograph of herself, with her hair in pigtails, wearing just a yellow bikini top and dark bottoms and a red AFL ball in one hand on Monday morning. She captioned: 'What a weekend! Had a blast with my girl. Melbourne.' One man who claimed he was in the box during the stunt said Ms McCartney was hired for the day and was promised double pay if she 'got naked and cheered in front of everyone'. Despite receiving messages of congratulations on Facebook, the incident has angered officials at the MCG, who have launched an investigation. MCG spokesman Shane Brown told the Herald Sun it would work with Victoria Police and the client to establish the circumstances and appropriate action would be taken. 'From the evidence available, we are very disappointed ... and are taking the matter seriously,' he said. An AFL spokesman said they were also awaiting on information from the MCC regarding the investigating. AFL Fans Association spokesman Brian Clarke said he was disgusted by the return of the 'blokey culture' to AFL. 'It's a disgrace. It's the people's game and it's for families,' he said. 'This goes against everything the AFL has been trying to achieve. I hope the AFL come down hard on those who were behind this.' The model appeared at a Melbourne court after a night in police custody . The court was told that McCartney was dared to strip naked if Hawthorn won the Grand Final against Swans .

Luiz Felipe Scolari (Brazil)Joachim Low (Germany) Job to do: Luiz Felipe Scolari's Brazil will have to try and make the final without Neymar . Team news: Luiz Felipe Scolari has several options to replace injured star man Neymar. Paulinho or Fernandinho could be asked to play a more advanced role now that regular midfielder Luis Gustavo is back from suspension. But the two biggest contenders to fill Neymar's position are Chelsea forward Willian or Shakhtar Donetsk's Bernard. Neither player has started a match for Brazil during the World Cup, but Willian has come off the bench in all but one of the team's matches. Bernard, a tricky, diminutive 21-year-old, has made two substitute appearances during the tournament. Brazil captain Thiago Silva will also miss out due to suspention and will be replaced by Dante with David Luiz taking the captain's armband. Germany coach Joachim Low has no such selection problems with only Shkodran Mustafi unavailable, yet he still does not seem to have found his first-choice starting XI. Philipp Lahm moved back to right-back in the quarter-final against France with Miroslav Klose making his first start up front, where Thomas Muller had previously been first choice. Mesut Ozil has struggled to deliver while Lukas Podolski no longer seems to figure in Low's plans. Key clash: Oscar (Brazil) v Bastian Schweinsteiger (Germany) With Neymar injured Oscar will revert to his preferred No 10 role and he will be looking to constantly put pressure on Schweinsteiger who, despite being one of the world’s best midfielders, will have his questionable fitness tested by the Brazilian.

Joachim Low has no major injury concerns in his Germany squad .
Brazil have reached the semi-finals of the World Cup for the first time since 2002, a year that they went on to lift the trophy.
The Seleção have lost none of their last six semi-final matches, winning five and drawing the other.As such, Brazil have advanced through to the final in each of their last six appearances in the final four; needing penalties just once (versus Holland in 1998).
Germany are the first country to reach the semi-finals of the World Cup in four consecutive tournaments.
However, they have reached the final just once (2002) in their previous three appearances at this stage.
This will be only the second meeting between these two nations at the World Cup.The first clash came in the 2002 final when Brazil won 2-0; with Ronaldo scoring both goals.
Since that 2002 final the two teams have met three times in all competitions, including in the 2005 Confederations Cup. They have won one match each with the other ending in a draw.
Their last meeting came in August 2011. Goals from Bastian Schweinsteiger, Andre Schurrle and Mario Gotze helped Germany to a 3-2 win. Neymar and Robinho netted for Brazil.
Brazil have scored in each of their last 10 clashes with Germany, averaging 2.2 goals per game.Neymar has scored four goals and assisted another in the 2014 World Cup; but will miss the rest of the tournament through injury.
The Barcelona forward has played a hand in 50% of Brazil’s 10 goals so far in the tournament.Brazil’s captain Thiago Silva will miss the semi-final through suspension. Brazil have lost none of their last 10 matches that he has featured in (W8 D2).
Eyes on the record: Miroslav Klose needs one more goal to be the all time leading World Cup goalscorer .
Silva’s replacement in the Brazil team is likely to be Bayern Munich defender Dante. The defender has played 151 times in the German Bundesliga for FC Bayern and Borussia Monchengladbach.
Dante is one of four players (two of which are goalkeepers) in the Brazil squad yet to play a minute at the 2014 World Cup.
No side have kept more clean sheets in the 2014 World Cup than Germany (3), while Brazil have only kept one in their five matches.
Brazil have won just one of their last four World Cup matches against UEFA opposition. That victory came in the Group Stages of this tournament against Croatia (D1 L2).
Germany’s only defeat in their last nine matches against South American opposition at the World Cup came in the 2002 final versus Brazil. They have won six and drawn two of the other eight.
Germany’s last six goals in the competition have been netted by six different players.
Only Thomas Muller (4) has scored more goals for Germany in this competition than centre-back Mats Hummels (2).
Both teams had to rely on goals from centre-halves to win their quarter-final match (Thiago Silva, David Luiz and Mats Hummels).
Against Colombia, Brazil conceded 31 fouls; more than the Seleção have conceded in any single World Cup game from 1966 onwards.
Miroslav Klose needs one goal to be the World Cup’s all-time leading scorer. He is currently joint-top with Ronaldo (15 goals).
The Lazio forward is the only player from either squad that was part of the 2002 final."

He'd love a RT!' The American singer, 53, who is father to global pop sensation and wild child, Miley Cyrus, sent the message on to his 1.75million followers. Scroll down for video . Billy Ray Cyrus was tricked in to retweeting a picture of paedophile Jimmy Savile to his millions of followers . The American singer, best known for his 'Achy Breaky Heart' song, was fooled into retweeting the image . The country singer performing in 2006 (left) and (right) with daughter Miley, who he starred with in the Disney Channel series Hannah Montana . But fans were quick to alert him of the mistake to tell him the image was one of Britain's most predatory sex offenders. Savile abused at least 500 victims, with the youngest allegedly just two years old, the NSPCC has reported. The most common age group for his victims was 13 to 15. He also targeted hospital patients, ranging from five-year-old children to 75-year-old pensioners, including men, women, boys and girls. He may have even committed sex acts on dead bodies in the mortuary at Leeds General Infirmary. Donald Trump, 68, was tricked into sharing this photo of serial killers Fred and Rose West after he was sent a message by a follower saying the tycoon had been a 'big inspiration' to his parents . The team who run the Apprentice US star's Twitter feed shared the message, but quickly removed it after realising the mistake. The serial killers (right) murdered young women and girls between the 1960s and 1980s . Five hours after he shared the post, the tycoon said it was evidence you should not be 'nice and trusting' The concept of 'Rickrolling' is basically sending a person a link to something that appears interesting or relevant. But it is actually just a disguise - when the person clicks on the link, it takes them to Rick Astley's uber-cheesey music video for his 1987 song 'Never Gonna Give You Up.' The clip managed to find its way into pop culture, with celebrities and even politicians 'Rickrolling' people. Donald Trump was on the receiving end of a similar joke earlier this week, when he retweeted a picture of infamous serial murderers Fred and Rose West. The US business magnate was contacted on social media by Philip Bradbury, who sent him a message saying his late parents had always considered him a 'big inspiration'- but included an image of the convicted rapists and murderers instead. The message was quickly shared on the multi-millionaire's feed by his media team to his 2.7m followers but was taken down 40 minutes later after they realised their embarrassing mistake. But hours later the tycoon responded, saying he may sue the culprit.","Country singer was tricked into retweeting picture of the paedophile .

"A group of drunken friends who got naked in a bath with a stolen pet rabbit then tried to shave her, wrung her neck and threw her out of a window, have escaped jail. Rebecca Atkinson's much-loved white lion-headed rabbit, Percy, was stolen from its hutch and carried to a party in Seaham, County Durham, at the end of June. The whereabouts of the rabbit remained a mystery until Mrs Atkinson went online and saw a video which showed her pet being tortured to death. Percy was taken from her hutch and carried to a party where she was cruelly abused a group of drunken friends who tried to shave her, wrung her neck and threw her out of a window . Percy, a much-loved white-headed rabbit (pictured), was taken from her hutch by the group at the end of June - the Atkinson family found out what happened when they were contacted by a woman who saw the video . Rebecca Atkinson's daughter Jessica (pictured) said: ' I just can't believe anyone could be so cruel' The shocking video showed Percy being cruelly abused by Martin Bell, 20, Frank Hudson, 19 and two 17-year-olds who cannot be identified. Percy had recently given birth to five babies when she was snatched from her hutch - but those young rabbits all died because they could not survive without their mother, despite the efforts of their owners to rear them by hand. Peterlee Magistrates, in County Durham, heard how Bell and Hudson admitted causing unnecessary suffering to the pet. Chairman of the Bench William Brown told the pair: 'What we have had described to us is quite a horrendous event. 'It is a rabbit, somebody's pet and the difference between civilised people and uncivilised people is how they deal with the creatures on the earth with us. 'You did not treat that rabbit nicely.' Jessica Atkinson, pictured with mother Rebecca and new pet rabbit, Jonny, were devastated by the horrific suffering of their pet . Percy had just given birth to five babies but those bunnies died because they could not survive without her . Their offending was a joint enterprise, the court heard, although it was Bell who threw Percy out of the window, and one of the youths, who will be sentenced separately next week, who wrung her neck. Any of the four young men could have put a stop to her suffering, the chairman said. He said the panel considered the custodial sentences that many people in the area had called for, but instead sentenced Bell and Hudson to 18 month community orders, with 18 months supervision, and 200 hours of unpaid work each. They were both banned from keeping animals for five years, ordered to pay £85 costs each, a victim surcharge of £60 and £50 each in compensation to the Atkinson family. Mr Brown added: 'I think when you grow up and have a family and one of out children loses a pet, you will know how distressed they can be. 'While it is ""only"" a rabbit, it is somebody's pet and it meant a lot to them. 'I am sure you can see from social networking, people are horrified with what you have done. Today will not stop what aggravation you have been suffering.' The family were disappointed by the sentencing and said it was 'pathetic' and simply a 'slap on the wrist' In a victim impact statement read in court, Anthony Atkinson, 31, of Seaham, said his wife Rebecca, his step-children Jessica, 14, Aaron, 10, and son Brynn, four, were devastated. Mr Atkinson reported feeling numb, angry and unwilling to go out in case he confronted the youths and lost control. 'This broke our hearts,' he said. Mr Atkinson, a carer for his wife, said  his daughter noticed the rabbit was missing from her hutch the morning after Percy was stolen. The rabbit had been misnamed when they thought she was male. He did not report the missing pet to the police but made an appeal on Facebook and soon after his wife was contacted by a woman who had seen a similar rabbit on a video posted on Instagram. They could not bear to watch the horrific scenes themselves, but were shown a screen grab of the rabbit in Bell's arms as he sat naked with one of the youths who is brandishing a can of lager, and Hudson. The picture was shared on a local Facebook page and one of the youths messaged Mr Atkinson saying: 'Hello, that picture you put on Facebook with the rabbit - I'm on that photo. 'It got brought in the house and someone hoyed [threw] it out of the window. 'I'm just telling you the craic.' Jessica saw that Percy, her pet rabbit, was missing from her hutch the morning after she was stolen . The youth was arrested and he showed officers a black bin bag where Percy had been dumped. An autopsy showed she suffered a serious injury caused by landing hard on the ground. She would have been in pain before she had her neck wrung. The youth said the other 17-year-old had stolen the rabbit, brought it to the party and thrown it to the three of them in the bath. They drunkenly tried to wash and then shave her, without success, before Bell threw her out. The youth who sent the Facebook message to Mr Atkinson was the one who put her down. Paula Sanderson, prosecuting, said: 'None of the defendants made any attempt to stop any suffering caused to that rabbit.' When Hudson was interviewed by police he admitted it was 'mad' to put the pet in the bath and that she would have been scared. Mike Simpson, defending both men, said the 'only decent thing that anybody did that night was to put it out of its misery' once it had been so badly injured in the fall. He said both men had been subject to threats and, on at least one occasion, violence. 'There has been vilification on social media and perhaps that is what follows, having used social media themselves in the first place,' he said. Reacting to the sentences imposed, Mr Atkinson said: 'We feel robbed, after months of waiting it ends up with a slap on the wrist for them. 'They will be out and about, laughing. 'It is pathetic really. My wife is fuming.' He said thousands of people had signed a Justice for Percy petition calling for the defendants to be jailed.","Percy, the pet rabbit, was stolen from her hutch and taken to a party .

"Almost half of both France and Nigeria's starting lineups for their World Cup last-16 tie in Brasilia came from the Premier League. Here, Sportsmail looks at how the English-based contingent got on in Monday's game: . One winner: Kenneth Omeruo comes out on top against Arsenal striker Olivier Giroud in this duel . Familiar foes: Odemwingie and Evra came up against each other on the international stage . Troubles in front of goal: Victor Moses hooks Benzema's shot off the line as Nigeria looked to hold the French . Best of enemies: Kenneth Omeruo and Laurent Koscielny go up for a header during the last-16 tie . Anticipation: Chelsea youngter Omeruo tries to get in the way of a Giroud shot . 19 minutes: Tottenham's Huge Lloris gets beaten by Emenike at his near post. Luckily the goal is ruled out . 28 minutes: Olivier Giroud appears to aim an elbow at John Obi Mikel - but the incident goes unspotted by the referee. 37 minutes: Patrice Evra has his arms wrapped around Peter Odemwingie but the referee decides it does not warrant a penalty. 39 minutes: Finding himself running onto a pass on the edge of the box, Mathieu Debuchy blasts one of France's best chances wide. 48 minutes: John Obi Mikel brilliantly nutmegs Chelsea target Paul Pogba with a backheel . 63 minutes: Odemwingie flashes a snapshot at goal from the edge of the area but Lloris gets down low to save his powerful effort. 68 minutes: Victor Moses races back behind his goalkeeper to clear Benzema's shot off the line and keep the score at 0-0. 74 minutes: This time it's Mikel's turn to clear off the line as France turn up the pressure. Hugo Lloris (France, Tottenham) - 90 minutes . The Spurs 'keeper was perhaps lucky not to concede in the first half after Nigeria's Emenike was narrowly adjudged to be offside as he put Nigeria ahead, beating Lloris at his near post. Otherwise the sweeper-keeper was at his commanding best, dominating the high balls that Nigeria tried to send into the French penalty area. Mathieu Debuchy (France, Newcastle) - 90 minutes . The Newcastle man, starting ahead of new Manchester City right back Bacary Sagna ably supported Mathieu Valbuena down the right hand side. He was rarely tested defensively and even had a decent effort at goal towards the end of the first half with a shot that flew wide. Laurent Koscielny (France, Arsenal) - 90 minutes . Solid at the back, as he has been all season for his club. Koscielny dealt well with the high balls that Nigeria sent into the box but in truth he was rarely troubled except occasionally by Odemwingie's pace. Patrice Evra (France, Manchester United) - 90 minutes . Luke Shaw might find it difficult to find a place in the Manchester United side if their stalwart left back continues this kind of form. Evra was imperious down the left hand side but he perhaps could have conceded a penalty in the first half as he grappled with Peter Odemwingie - showing some of the worrying frailties that he displayed at Old Trafford last season. Olivier Giroud (France, Arsenal) - 61 minutes . Could be considered lucky to even be on the pitch for as long as he did after appearing to aim an elbow at John Obi Mikel in the first half. Giroud has been a frustrating figure for many Arsenal fans this season and he showed why against Nigeria. The French have experimented with pairing Giroud with Karim Benzema or playing the latter alone. Giroud's inability to combine with his strike partner upfront for France was one of the reasons they struggled to create much in the first hour of the game. France looked much better when he was withdrawn for goalscorer Antoine Griezmann. Battle: Giroud has to fight off the attentions of Omeruo as France seek to break down Nigeria . Bad boy: Giroud was substituted by Didier Deschamps as France went in search of a winner - which they found . Speed merchant: Chelsea loanee Moses uses his pace to get him around Manchester United's Evra . War: Victor Moses comes out on top in this challenge with Karim Benzema, with Odemwingie looking on . Kenneth Omeruo (Nigeria, Chelsea/Middlesbrough) - 90 minutes . Looked strong in the centre of defence against one of the World Cup's most effective offensive sides. While he seems unlikely to get a chance at Chelsea, Omeruo could be in line for a Premier League loan after a successful spell at Middlesbrough last season. John Obi Mikel (Nigeria, Chelsea) - 90 minutes . The Chelsea man was his usual self in the heart of midfield, keeping things ticking over and playing the unglamorous simple passes that are often under-appreciated. While he usually plays slightly further forward for his country, Mikel returned to his withdrawn role to combat France's runners from midfield. He found himself in the right place at the right time to clear off the line in the second half. His backheel on Pogba was brilliant. Victor Moses (Nigeria, Chelsea/Liverpool) - 88 minutes . Moses came into the side in place of the injured Michael Babatunde but struggled to make an impact. His clearance off the line with the score at 0-0 was brilliant though, and not something you would usually expect from the flying winger. He was unlucky to see his curling shot deflected by Debuchy as Nigeria tried to grab an equaliser. Peter Odemwingie (Nigeria, Stoke) - 90 minutes . Odemwingie has always been known as a bit of a troublemaker - and he was one of Nigeria's brightest sparks, using his space to cause problems for the French backline. He slammed one shot which Lloris did well to save but couldn't quite make the breakthrough for his side. We're through: Giroud might have had a poor game but he celebrates with North London rival Lloris here . On top: Hugo Lloris gets above three fellow Premier League players to punch the ball away . Clash: Debuchy tries to stop Chelsea's John Obi Mikel in his tracks as both sides struggled to create .","France and Nigeria started five and four Premier League stars respectively .

"Getting up in the middle of the night and navigating your way to the toilet can be tricky in the dark. But a new invention will light the way - and mean men never miss the bowl again - thanks to colour-changing LEDs fitted to the seat. Called IllumiBowl, the water-resistant lights turn on automatically using a motion sensor that detects when someone enters the bathroom. Scroll down for video . The water-resistant, colour-changing LEDs in IllumiBowl alternate between purple (left), red, orange, blue (centre), white and green (right). The device is fitted with motion sensors that detect when someone enters the bathroom, and switches off autoamtically when they leave . They then switch off after the user has left. The LEDs are the brainchild of 23-year-old Matt Alexander from Utah, who was inspired to create the IllumiBowl because he ‘hated turning the bathroom light on in the middle of the night’. The LEDs are placed beneath the seat, to illuminate the entire bowl. They alternate between red, orange, green, blue, purple and white, and users can change the colour by moving a switch on the device. IllumiBowl LEDs are placed beneath the seat, to illuminate the entire bowl. They alternate between red, orange, green, blue, purple and white and users can change the colour by moving a switch on the device. The water-resistant gadget turns on automatically using a motion sensor that detects when someone enters the bathroom. It then switches off after the user has left. The 2-inch (5cm) device uses two AAA batteries, and an LED is said to last for more than 11 years. It is available to pre-order from Mr Alexander’s Kickstarter campaign for $15 (£9), and is set to ship in January. Mr Alexander, from Provo, Utah, said: ‘I came up with the idea because I hate turning the light on in the middle of the night! ‘The device works by a motion sensor. It turns on when you walk in and turns off when you leave. ‘It is a colour-changing LED that changes between colours every few seconds. ‘If you want to freeze it on a specific colour just move the switch and it will stay on that colour permanently unless you move the switch back. ‘We are developing a future model with a germ killing UV LED as well.’ He admitted he also designed it to stop men from ‘missing the toilet’ in the dark - something he believes will ‘save a lot of marriages’. The 2-inch (5cm) device uses two AAA batteries, and an LED is said to last for more than 11 years. It is available to pre-order from Mr Alexander’s Kickstarter campaign for $15 (£9), and is set to ship internationally in January. The campaign has already surpassed its $20,000 (£12,500) funding target by raising more than $48,000 (£30,000) three weeks before it ends.

The device also means users don’t have to turn the light on in the middle of the night. It can be pre-ordered from Kickstarter and is set to ship internationally in January . Mr Alexander, a student at Brigham Young University, added: ‘The device protects you from blinding light in the middle of the night. 'And it also helps parents with children because little children can’t reach the light switch and mothers want to use it to help potty train their toddlers. ‘I love how convenient it is to go to the bathroom in the middle of the night now and just how cool it looks to have a glowing throne.’","LEDs alternate between red, orange, green, blue, purple and white .

"Drunk driver: Marco Antonio Dominguez, 24, told a cop he would join ISIS and then return to kill him . A drunk driver told a cop who he was planning to join ISIS and threatened that when he did he would return to kill him. Marco Antonio Dominguez, 24, from Hendersonville, Tennessee, was stopped on suspicion of being under the influence overnight. When he was arrested for DUI, he told the officer while in the back of the patrol car: 'I am going to join ISIS and when I do, you will be the first person I kill'. According to the arrest report, he continued to threaten the officers saying: 'Why don't you take these handcuffs off and (I'll) show you what I am made of,' according to the report. Officers who arrived said he had slurred speech, was unsteady on his feet and had vomit all over his pants. At the time he was standing outside his vehicle which had a smashed-in windshield which police believe was caused by him hitting a sign on Interstate 65. Arrest reports state that Dominguez pulled over at a gas station at West Trinity Lane, outside a Subway restaurant. Dominguez was charged with drunk driving, assault, driving without a license, and leaving the scene of an accident. Dominguez, who is locked up on $20,000 bond, is scheduled for a court hearing today.

"A teenager used a bounced cheque to swindle £13,400 worth of liposuction  from a top London plastic surgery clinic, a court heard today. Racine Peters  obtained the treatment dishonestly from the EF MEDISPA clinic in Kensington, London in August, Hammersmith Magistrates' Court was told. The 18-year-old is accused of obtaining thousands of pounds worth of cosmetic surgery by forging a Metro Bank letter - and presenting a cheque knowing there were insufficient funds in the account. Racine Peters (pictured) used a bounced cheque to swindle £13,400 worth of liposuction treatment from a top London plastic surgery clinic, a court heard today .

'I've been holding flashlights and helping work on the trucks since I was three,' she said. 'At eight, I was trying to move eight hundred pound tires that are five feet tall - it's kind of crazy. 'I started driving monster trucks professionally when I was just 14-years-old - there aren't any girls who have done that quite yet.

"Germany reacted in wonder and disbelief as their national team thrashed Brazil 7-1 to reach the final of the World Cup. Even tabloid Bild found themselves lost for words as they tried to document what had unfolded in a remarkable semi-final at the Estadio Mineirao in Belo Horizonte. 'Without words' ran the headline on Wednesday's front cover as the paper allowed the scoreline and celebration picture do the talking. VIDEO Scroll down for German fans celebrate their 7-1 victory over hosts Brazil . 'Without words': Bild let the 7-1 scoreline do the talking on the front cover of their Wednesday edition following Germany's memorable triumph over Brazil in the semi-finals of the World Cup .

Crestfallen: David Luiz is consoled by the suspended Thiago Silva, whom he replaced as captain for the match, at the final whistle . VIDEO Disbelief in Belo Horizonte after devastating Germany win . Germany blew Brazil away in a sensational 18-minute spell in the first-half that yielded five goals - two from Toni Kroos and one apiece for Thomas Muller, Miroslav Klose and Sami Khedira. Klose's goal saw him overtake Brazil legend Ronaldo as the leading goalscorer in World Cup tournaments, with 16 now to his name. Substitute Andre Schurrle added two further goals after the break to extend the lead to seven, before Oscar scored a late consolation. Lukas Podolski was straight on to Twitter with a dressing room celebration picture, writing: 'Amazing win!! Rio we are coming...'

Delighted: Mesut Ozil posted a celebration picture with Julian Draxler in the dressing room . Dream lives on: Jerome Boateng tweeted this message after the remarkable win in Belo Horizonte . He was shown alongside Khedira, Schurrle and Klose in the changing room and the latter praised the team's togetherness afterwards. 'You could see in training that we harmonise greatly,' said Klose. 'We are one unit and you can see that in the pitch. It was so important that our set-pieces work. 'Toni brings the ball exactly there where it belongs. I was hit during my goal so there was no chance to do a (celebration) flip.' Record-breaker: Miroslav Klose celebrates scoring Germany's second goal, taking him above Brazilian legend Ronaldo to become the World Cup's all-time leading scorer . Muller admits they were surprised by the margin of victory, although he accepts they benefited hugely from Brazil's wide-open approach. 'You couldn't expect that at all but you can see on that how different games can develop,' he said. 'The spaces were bigger today than against defence-minded teams. We benefited from that overwhelmingly, at one point you have broken the opponent. 'Now we have to keep pushing, give full power and get the cup.' Kroos admitted Germany’s players were stunned by the manner of the humiliation. He said: ‘We realised the Brazilians were not so clear in their actions in the first few minutes, and we took advantage of that. Sometimes we couldn’t even believe it ourselves, that it was 5-0 after only a few minutes. We delivered an outstanding match today. ‘We delivered a marvellous performance. But we’re here to become world champions, and we’re not world champions yet. That’s the feeling in the dressing room: we have a tough task ahead still.’ Post-match treat: Thomas Muller eats pasta as he salutes the German supporters after the full-time whistle . Breakthrough: Muller started the rout by scoring after 11 minutes, with the floodgates opening from there . Former German players took to Twitter to celebrate the fantastic result. Michael Ballack was pictured holding up seven fingers, Jurgen Klinsmann tweeted in capital letters and Dietmar Hamann summed up the team's qualities. He posted on Twitter: 'Master class from Germany. Clinical, organised, hard working, unselfish and humble. Very proud of the team. One to go.' Germany coach Joachim Low believes Brazil cracked under the pressure of being hosts. Low said: 'Let's put it into context: the hosts were unable to deal with the pressure. 'We had a clear, persistent game-plan and if we were courageous and believed in our own strengths, we would win this match. 'That the result would be so emphatic was not to be expected. Scoring three in four minutes the hosts were in shock, confused, and never returned to their original organisation. We were extremely cool and realised they were cracking up, and we took advantage of that.' Cracked: Germany boss Joachim Low commiserates with his counterpart Luiz Felipe Scolari after the end of the match . Low said Germany must turn their attention to Sunday's final, and that he understood what Brazil must now be going through. He added: 'We've won this match. We're in the final of the World Cup, against a different opponent. We were lucky that the hosts were shell-shocked. Now we must prepare well for the final. 'I remember once losing to Italy in Germany when everyone wanted us to go to the final. We lost in the 119th minute back in 2006, so we knew how Scolari feels, how the Brazilian team feel, and the people in Brazil feel right now.' Wolfgang Niersbach, president of the German Football Association, hailed a momentous occasion. 'This is an historic day for German football,' he said. Thrilled: Jurgen Klinsmann was obviously and understandably thrilled by the performance . Seventh heaven: Michael Ballack salutes the victory while working as a TV pundit .

"Marouane Fellaini insists he has nothing to prove after it emerged that Manchester United are ready to cut their losses on the Belgian midfielder. Sportsmail revealed on Wednesday that new Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal has instructed executive-vice chairman Edward Woodward to sell Fellaini, with the Dutch manager understood to have told associates that the former Everton players is not of the right calibre for the Old Trafford club. Nothing to prove: Marouane Fellaini trains with Belgium ahead of their quarter final with Argentina . Fellaini, who disappointed once again during Belgium’s victory over the USA in the first knockout round of the World Cup, insists he has nothing in Brazil despite a traumatic first season at Old Trafford. The Belgian started just twelve Premier League and failed to score as David Moyes endured a dismal campaign after taking over from Sir Alex Ferguson last summer. Talking a good game: Fellaini speaks to the media at Belgium's training camp . Tough going: Fellaini had a difficult first season at Manchester United . But Fellaini, who Moyes brought to the club in a £27.5million deal from Everton, told Sky Sports News: ‘I don’t have to prove (anything) - I’ve been a professional footballer for eight years.’ United are believed to be prepared to listen to offers in the region of £15m for Fellaini but the Belgian refused to comment when quizzed over his Old Trafford future, simply stating: ‘We will see after the World Cup.’ Fellaini must now attempt to impress potential suitors with improved performances at the World Cup and he will have the perfect chance to do so when Belgian side face Argentina in the quarter-final of the competition on Saturday evening.","Manchester United keen to cut their losses with £27.5m signing and sell him this summer .

"Manchester United fans drooling at the prospect of Louis van Gaal bringing a clutch of Holland players with him to Old Trafford had their bubble burst on Sunday, as a number of reported targets went missing against Mexico. The only players linked with a move to United that emerged with any credit in Fortaleza were Dirk Kuyt, the former Liverpool attacker unusually employed at left wing-back by van Gaal, and centre-back Stefan de Vrij. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Manchester United target De Jong starring in AC Milan training . United-bound: Van Gaal surveys the action in Fortaleza as Holland left it late to beat Mexico . Targets: Martins Indi, De Jong and Janmaat have all been linked with moves to Old Trafford . Kuyt is renowned for his willingness to chase lost causes and put his body on the line for his team, and that was the case again as he played in a deep position on the left and made some crucial tackles in defensive areas for Holland. De Vrij, meanwhile, looked good moving out of defence with the ball but was shaky when dealing with Mexico's vibrant attacking pair of Oribe Peralta and Giovani dos Santos. Holland were dealt an early blow as Nigel de Jong was forced off through injury. The AC Milan player  lasted just nine minutes before limping off to be replaced by another United target Bruno Martins Indi. De Jong has been crucial for Holland at the last two World Cups and his presence was missed in central areas, with Daley Blind moving into midfield to take his place. In fact, Mexico took the lead with a swerving shot from exactly the kind of area that De Jong usually patrols. Giovani dos Santos pushed the ball away from Blind 25 yards from goal and then smacked a shot into the bottom right corner with his left foot. Game over: De Jong was forced off by injury after just nine minutes of the game at Estadio Castelao . Dogged defending: Kuyt performed well despite being played out of position at left wing-back . United’s search for centre-backs to replace Rio Ferdinand and Nemanja Vidic has been well documented. Two of Holland’s back-three against Mexico, Martins Indi and De Vrij, have been outlined as van Gaal targets, but neither impressed defensively against Miguel Herrera’s side. United are said to be hijacking Lazio’s move for De Vrij, while Martins Indi is reported to have an offer on the table from Porto. Martins Indi was strong in the air but he struggled with the pace and directness of Dos Santos and Peralta. Header: Martins Indi was strong in the air but not a lot else for an under-par Holland side . Pass-master: De Vrij's distribution was good but he looked less comfortable against Mexico's pace in attack . De Vrij was comfortable bringing the ball out of defence. On a number of occasions he nicked the ball from Mexico’s attackers, strolled forward and then played incisive passes towards Arjen Robben and Robin van Persie. One of Holland’s best chances in the game from a similar passage of play. Midway through the first half De Vrij waltzed over the halfway line and pinged a forward pass to van Persie. The Manchester United attacker controlled the ball brilliantly but his shot on the turn let him down, the ball flashing wide of Guillermo Ochoa’s goal. VIDEO Dutch party rumbles on . Van the man: The Manchester United forward wasted a couple of chances and was replaced by Huntelaar . Another United target, Daryl Janmaat, played no part against Mexico. Van Gaal is reportedly keen on taking the right-back to Old Trafford with him, but the Dutch boss did not trust him to start in their last-16 clash, instead picking Augsburg defender Paul Verhaegh. Van Gaal's team relied on some late magic from old-timers Wesley Sneijder and Arjen Robben to spare their blushes, the former lashing home from a corner and the latter winning the penalty that Huntelaar slotted into the corner to put Holland through.

"An estranged wife has alleged her former husband has taken two expensive paintings from their luxury apartment. Lydia Astill claims the most substantial item allegedly taken from the property by her husband, Cameron, is the Brett Whiteley painting 'Interior with Bull-Bull Egg Sculpture. The affluent Gold Coast couple, who are believed to own several exclusive properties together, are now embroiled in a bitter battle over the artworks. Ms Astill has told police the couple had yet to decide who would claim the paintings from one of Australia's most influential artists, the Gold Coast Bulletin reported.

Brett Whiteley is considered one of the most important and influential artists in Australia since World War Two. He won numerous art prizes before his death at 53 from a heroin overdose. Last year, Whiteley's painting  My Armchair sold for $3.2 million, making it the the all time second highest price for an Australian painting. Gold Coast Chief Superintendent Des Lacy told The Gold Coast Bulletin: 'It appears to be a civil dispute and the fact is you can't steal your own property,' Mr Lacy said.

"The International Monetary Fund has lowered its outlook for global economic growth this year and next, mostly because of weaker expansions in Japan, Latin America and Europe. The IMF said on Tuesday the global economy will grow 3.3 percent this year, one-tenth of a point below what it forecast in July. World growth should then pick up to 3.8 percent in 2015, two-tenths of a point lower than its previous estimate, the IMF said in the latest installment of its World Economic Outlook. The global lending organization has a more optimistic view of the U.S. economy, which it expects will grow 2.2 percent this year, up from an earlier forecast of 1.7 percent. Its forecast for 3.1 percent growth in the U.S. next year was unchanged. The revised forecast was announced at a press conference held by the IMF in Washington on Tuesday . Still, the global lending organization warned that the U.S., Europe and Japan could face years of sluggish growth unless governments take steps to accelerate activity. It acknowledged that it has frequently cut its forecasts in the past several years, and said that was partly because of slower long-run growth in advanced economies. 'The recovery continues, but it is weak and it is uneven,' Olivier Blanchard, chief economist at the IMF, said at a press conference. Blanchard warned that low interest rates have made investors 'too complacent' in the advanced economies, particularly about the uncertainty around interest rates in the U.S. That could trigger sharp falls in financial markets, especially if rates rise faster than expected. The IMF forecasts for China unchanged growth at 7.4 percent this year and 7.1 percent in 2015. While those figures would be healthy for most nations, they represent the slowest growth for China in decades . The IMF predicts that Russia's economy will be brought to a near-standstill by sanctions and falling confidence among international investors . Turmoil in the Ukraine and Middle East also pose risks to global growth, though for now the economic impact is limited to the countries involved, Blanchard said. The IMF forecasts that Russia's economy will be brought to a near-standstill by sanctions and falling confidence among international investors. The IMF forecasts that growth in the 18 countries that use the euro will be just 0.8 percent this year, down from 1.1 percent in its July forecast. It lowered its 2015 projection to 1.3 percent from 1.5 percent. Japan will grow just 0.9 percent in 2014, the fund said, down from the 1.6 percent pace the IMF previously projected. It sees Japan's growth slipping to 0.8 percent in 2015, down from its July estimate of 1 percent. The world's No. 3 economy has slowed after a large sales tax took effect this spring. It left its forecasts for China unchanged at 7.4 percent this year and 7.1 percent in 2015. While those figures would be healthy for most nations, they represent the slowest growth for China in decades. The report predicts that the U.S. Federal Reserve will hold off raising interest rates until the middle of next year . The fund also sharply cut its forecast for Latin America and the Caribbean, which it now expects to grow just 1.3 percent in 2014, down from a July estimate of 2 percent. Growth will be 2.2 percent in 2015, down from 2.6 percent. The figures largely reflect weakness in Brazil. The report is being released ahead of this weekend's annual joint meetings of the IMF and World Bank in Washington. The IMF urged the United States, Europe and Japan to keep interest rates low to spur more borrowing, spending and growth. The European Central Bank should also consider buying government bonds if needed to avoid deflation, the report said. The fund also said the U.S. and Europe should benefit from fewer tax increases and spending cuts in 2014 than in previous years. The report predicts that the U.S. Federal Reserve will hold off raising interest rates until the middle of next year. The report echoes a speech last week from IMF managing director Christine Lagarde, who said that policymakers need to pursue bold policies to ensure that the 'new mediocre' doesn't become permanent . But aging populations and lower productivity threaten to lower long-run growth in advanced economies, including the U.S. but 'especially (Europe) and Japan,' the IMF said. To counter those trends, governments should consider spending more on infrastructure, education and job training, the IMF added. The report echoes a speech last week from IMF managing director Christine Lagarde, who said that policymakers need to pursue bold policies to ensure that the 'new mediocre' doesn't become permanent.","IMF has lowered its global economic outlook for this year and next due to weak markets in Japan, Latin America and Europe .

"Liverpool are set to miss out on their number one left back target Alberto Moreno, after they failed to agree a fee with Spanish club Sevilla. The 21-year-old Europa League winner has been tracked by Brendan Rodgers for some time and although negotiations were lengthy the two have been 'miles apart' on their valuations of the player with the Spaniards looking for £20million. 'The matter of Alberto is practically settled. We couldn't reach an agreement and I don't think it can be revived,' Sevilla's Sporting Director Monchi told Spanish newspaper El Correo de Andalucia. Top target: Moreno was identified as Liverpool's top choice at left back but they failed to agree a fee . 'It was great offer but the player is only 21 years old and it's possible that the catharsis of being with the national team had a positive effect. 'He has a lot of room to grow and the coach is very happy to have him. 'I don't think we'll make a lot of moves but if on August 14 a club comes along and they give you a mountain of cash, well....I know you don't like to hear it, but we are economic managers. 'My feeling is that the negotiations are paralysed and I don't see any hint that they will be restarted. Youngster: Moreno has been linked to many sides and is considered to be one of the best young left backs . 'We put a price on our players which we believe to be appropriate.

"Fabio Capello claims 'all referees are against us' after Russia crashed out of the World Cup at the hands of Algeria, and says a laser pointed at Igor Akinfeev blinded the goalkeeper for the equaliser.

"Defence cuts have left the Royal Navy so short of engineers it has had to borrow some from the US Coast Guard. This month, American servicemen will start work as engineering technicians on board Type 23 frigates on the south coast. If it is a success, there will be a total of 36 Coast Guard personnel working in the positions in Portsmouth by the end of 2016. The Royal Navy's Type 23 frigate HMS Westminster, moored in Portsmouth Naval Base . The navy says it is bringing the engineers to the city because of cuts to staff numbers in the government's 2010 Strategic Defence and Security Review. Critics have called it a 'desperate move', saying it proves armed forces redundancies, which saw the loss of around 500 engineers in 2011, are a false economy. Former naval officer Mike Critchley, the publisher of maritime book Warship World, said: 'Having to borrow engineers is hugely embarrassing and bringing them across is a desperate move. 'It is fortunate the US Coast Guard has excess personnel at the moment, after they have paid off some ships that were very manpower intensive. 'You can't just recruit guys off the street and train them - the Royal Navy is looking for experience. 'But I'm sure these guys will do a great job and keep ships at sea.' The project will cost the navy £187,000 from April 2014 to April 2015, and the average pay for each engineer is £35,000. First Class Cadet Holly Madden logs a reading in a ship engine room . Admiral Lord Alan West, a former head of the Royal Navy, said he thought the move was a sensible one. He said: 'There is a national shortage of engineers in this country, and that is obviously going to affect the military as well. 'I have served with a lot of Americans and they fit in extremely well. 'This seems to me a good temporary measure but there does come a stage where we need more people in the navy.' The Royal Navy said it is actively recruiting in all branches, including engineering. It is not uncommon for servicemen and women from other nations to serve on board Royal Navy warships. The First Sea Lord Admiral Sir George Zambellas welcomed the move, saying: 'The professional maritime partnership between the USA and the UK is one without equal. 'This latest initiative strengthens its authority further still. 'The Royal Navy already enjoys a highly successful collaboration with the US Coast Guard as we fight the war on drugs together. 'But this agreement takes our partnership to the next level - and beyond - and I warmly welcome that. 'It is quite true that the Royal Navy is under significant manpower pressure in key specialist skills to meet today's commitments. 'This is a recognised leadership and management challenge that is part and parcel of the Royal Navy's renaissance. 'We are working to meet that challenge, but also to chase the opportunities it offers, but I do not expect it to throw us off track.' The trial partnership will begin this month when four personnel come over from America. Another 16 will follow in 2015 and 16 more in 2016, bringing the total to 36. The Royal Navy already has a number of regular and ongoing exchanges with other foreign navies including the French, Australian and New Zealand.","Americans will start work on board Type 23 frigates later this month .

"The parents of Ashya King have spoken of their flight across Europe and arrest - and revealed their anger at being branded a threat to their sick son by police. Brett and Naghmeh King were detained in Spain three weeks ago after an international manhunt, accused of ‘abducting’ their five-year-old son who has a rare form of cancer from an NHS hospital in Southampton. Speaking exclusively to the Daily Mail, they revealed their anguish at being taken away from Ashya after their arrest at a Malaga hotel on August 30, in Naghmeh’s case for the first time since his birth. Scroll down for video . Anger: Brett (left) and Naghmeh King (right) have spoken of their flight across Europe and arrest - and revealed their anger at being branded a threat to their sick son Ashya (centre) by police . Their son was largely left alone in a Spanish hospital during their three-day detention, howling in despair and confusion at being apart from his family. Held in grimy adjoining cells at a Spanish police station, Mr King recalled: ‘She [Naghmeh] was crying: “Ashya, where is my Ashya?” On and on and on. ‘She was saying: “Are you happy now? We should have stayed in England — this would never have happened.” Suddenly it was my fault. ‘I said: “Please, if you carry on like this I will have to move cells. My heart is so high in my chest.” I could feel it up here somewhere.’ He thumps his sternum. ‘I said: “Please stop, I can’t take it any more.” She didn’t stop.’ Ordeal: While she was being held in custody, Mrs King would cry 'Ashya, where is my Ashya?' Arrest: Mr and Mrs King, seen leaving a police station in Malaga for an extradition court hearing, were arrested and thrown into cells in one of Spain’s most notorious prisons for three nights . Mrs King said: ‘I wasn’t crying for myself in prison, I was crying for Ashya. I didn’t want him to be alone in a foreign country not understanding the language. I was just praying the nurses would feel sorry for him, be with him, so he wasn’t completely alone.’ The following morning, their son Danny told them he was being prevented from seeing his little brother. Mr King said: ‘I knew Danny loved Ashya and wouldn’t leave his bed. But the police chief had given the order. When we saw him I said: “Are we criminals for what we’ve done?” ‘He said: “I have no knowledge of you or your son.” I pleaded with him to let Danny see Ashya. I said: “He’s a sick five-year-boy. He won’t know what’s happening. He’ll be terrified. He’ll think we’ve all abandoned him”.’ According to Mr King, the police chief told him: ‘From what we’ve heard from England, your other son could go in there and cause him harm. He needs protection from you all.’ Diagnosis: Ashya, pictured with his sister Sion around one month before his surgery, was diagnosed with a brain tumour in July after his mother noticed he had problems with his knee and keeping his balance . Brother: Mr and Mrs King' said they had to plead with the police chief to left their son Danny (pictured centre, leaving the Malaga children's hospital) see his little brother . Later that day, the Kings were ‘bundled into a car’, taken to a small town on the outskirts of Malaga to appear before a court before being transferred to Madrid for an extradition hearing. Ashya’s case sparked widespread public outrage that his parents had been unfairly vilified for seeking the best treatment for their little boy. Mr King decided to flee with Ashya from Southampton General Hospital in late August when he says he was told, in no uncertain terms, that his son’s cancer didn’t qualify for proton treatment. If he asked any more questions, he claims Ashya would be taken from his parents — an allegation that Southampton Hospital has denied. Certain that proton therapy in the Czech Republic would give his son a greater quality of life, he began to make preparations for the trip. Mr King said: ‘Ashya needed to have the therapy four to six weeks after removal of the tumour for the best chance of survival, so time was running out. We had a buyer for our apartment in Spain, which we were selling to raise funds. I called the estate agent to tell him to sell, quickly.’ Plight: Ashya was largely left alone in a Spanish hospital during his parents' three-day detention, howling in despair and confusion at being apart from his family . 'Protection': According to Mr King, the police chief told him: 'From what we've heard from England, your other son could go in there and cause him harm. He needs protection from you all' Ashya’s welfare remained their primary concern. First, they needed to stock up on the protein shakes his son depended upon so Mr King went online to order two large boxes to pick up in Spain. They also renewed Ashya’s passport and bought a wheelchair. On August 28, five-and-a-half weeks after Ashya’s surgery they fled to the continent via a ferry. Fearing for Ashya’s wellbeing, doctors contacted the police, who launched an appeal for information on the King family’s whereabouts. A media storm erupted as they warned that the child needed specialist equipment to keep him alive and that ‘time was running out’. The hospital also revealed the fact the family are Jehovah’s Witnesses, creating the impression the Kings were religious zealots putting their son’s life at risk. Outcry: Ashya’s case sparked widespread public outrage that his parents had been unfairly vilified for seeking the best treatment for their little boy . The first the family knew of the police hunt was when Mr King Skyped his mother, Patricia, at her home in Southsea, Hampshire, from Madrid. ‘She said: “It’s terrible here. The police have been round searching my house. They’re looking for you. This message is probably being taped. You’d better go.” ‘When I told Naghmeh, she just wanted to get back into the car and drive.’ By now in Spain, the family began the 280-mile journey from Madrid to their holiday apartment on the coast. Mr King said: ‘We knew there was a children’s hospital in Malaga, so we found a hotel called Esperanza, which means hope in Spanish. That was what we needed.’ It was here that their son, Naveed, 20, suggested making a video and posting it on YouTube so the world could see his little brother was safe. Five minutes after the recording was made, their eldest son Danny, 23, returned to the room. He’d overheard the receptionist on the phone to her boss; they were calling the police. Ten minutes later, two officers arrived and arrested the couple. ‘They said: “Hi, how’s everything?” I said: “Fine, no problem.” I had no idea what lay in store.’ The Kings were to spend the next 72 hours in prison, facing extradition to the UK to face charges under the 1933 Child Cruelty Act. The last they saw of their sick son was through the ambulance window as he lay on his back being driven away. ‘We thought we’d be able to sort this out at the police station,’ says Mr King. Instead, the Kings were fingerprinted and placed in adjoining tiled cells where they each had a thin plastic mattress and a quilt that stank of urine. Back in the UK, the story of Ashya’s disappearance had reached fever pitch, with questions being asked over whether his parents had been unfairly demonised. Accusations: The Kings were detained in Spain three weeks ago after an international manhunt, accused of ‘abducting’ their five-year-old son who has a rare form of cancer . Desperation: Mr King decided to flee with Ashya from Southampton General Hospital in late August when he says he was told, in no uncertain terms, that his son’s cancer didn’t qualify for proton treatment . The couple were eventually freed by a judge and reunited with their son. He is now in hospital in Prague where he is undergoing pioneering treatment for his cancer. Last night a hospital spokesman said: ‘Southampton General Hospital has defended its decision to recommend standard radiotherapy and chemotherapy and said its treatment plan for Ashya complied with NHS best practice guidelines. ‘The Trust was concerned for Ashya’s safety because, among other reasons, Ashya was dependent on a tube for food and his -parents are not trained to use it. ‘The Trust contacted the police in line with Trust policy to alert them to the problem.’","Brett and Naghmeh King detained in Spain after international manhunt .

"Vain: Michaela Hutchings spent £52,000 Litchfield Council put in her account by mistake, instead of reporting the error . A young woman went on a marathon shopping spree hours after a bungling council accidentally credited her bank account with £52,000, a court heard yesterday. Michaela Hutchings, 23, spent £9,000 on expensive designer clothes, sunglasses and other items after finding the money in her account. Instead of reporting the error, she also gave her mother Elaine £1,000 in cash, before she  was caught by police on April 24 last year. After she was caught, officers . discovered she had transferred £40,000 into an investment account after . taking advice from her bank, which was unaware of the mistake. The . mother of one was found guilty of dishonesty and retaining a wrongly . credited bank transfer when she appeared  at Stafford Crown Court on . Monday. Recorder Derek Desmond told her: ‘A little over £52,000 was put . into your account in error. ‘That had nothing to do with you. You didn’t cause that error, but you decided to keep it.’ He added that Hutchings, from Lichfield, Staffordshire, was encouraged to spend the money by her boyfriend at the time. He . said: ‘I have no doubt you were influenced by your partner – he wanted . to spend the money. You went on a spending spree and between you, you . spent £9,000. This man who spurred you on is no longer in your life – no . doubt your family will be glad about that.’ Hutchings, who is believed to be a . single stay-at-home mother,  was given a 12-month community order and . told to carry out 150 hours of unpaid work. The . court heard an administrative error meant Lichfield District Council . accidentally transferred £52,000 into her account instead of paying . Bromford Housing Association. Bubbly: Hutchings spent £9,000 at a Birmingham shopping centre after the money was accidentally transferred . Saving: The 23-year old from Lichfield, Staffordshire, also put £40,000 into an investment account . The . council managed to stop a further £44,500 being transferred into her . account and desperately tried to trace her to explain the error. But by the time they caught Hutchings, she had spent more than £9,000 during a shopping spree at Birmingham’s Bull- ring centre. The court heard that she and her partner bought designer shoes, jeans, sunglasses and other luxuries. Hutchings, . the mother of a young daughter, will face a further investigation under . the Proceeds of Crime Act relating to the £40,000 she transferred into . an investment account. Phillip Bradley, defending, said she admitted to a . ‘fleeting moment of pleasure’ in spending the money. 'Influenced': Hutchings also bought designer clothes and sunglasses with the Lichfield Council's money . He . added: ‘However, in her mind she was aware this situation would end . badly. This was a woman who had shown no sign of dishonesty in her . life.’ Hutchings, who posted . a series of glamorous images of herself on social media websites, left . the court in tears after being told she would not be jailed. Lichfield . councillor Christopher Spruce said after the hearing: ‘Last April, due . to a contractor’s clerical error, £52,000 was transferred to a benefits . claimant, rather than to one of our housing association partners. ‘We are working with the police to recover the wrongly transferred funds. ‘We . are also working closely with our partners to put additional checks . into our systems to ensure a similar payment error cannot happen again . in the future.’","Michaela Hutchings blew £9,000 on trip to Birmingham's Bullring Centre .

"There is a 43-year-old, 5ft 5in Brazilian that wears the nickname ‘Pe-de-anjo’, or the ‘foot of the angel’. The name Marcelinho Carioca emerged in conversations after David Luiz earned a garland for his latest artistic execution with one swish of that side-foot, sending the ball swerving at a searing velocity into the top right-hand corner of David Ospina’s goal to defeat Colombia. Carioca was revered for his unique technique when he approached the dead-ball during a glittering career largely spent in his native Brazil, and this was the reference point for Brazil manager Luiz Felipe Scolari in the aftermath of David Luiz’s strike: ‘We had a player who played in Corinthians, Marcelinho Carioca.

He, . perhaps more than any other player, is riding the tidal wave of emotion, . seemingly immune to the expectations of hundreds of millions of . Brazilians watching on, from the Copacabana to the Amazonian jungle. Luiz etches his name into every game . at this World Cup, beginning with his visceral rendition of the Hino . Nacional Brasileiro.

Let's hear it: Luiz gears up for each match with a rendition of the national anthem in front of the home crowd . Even the mascots follow his lead, staring into the . distance, belting out every word, as though it would be an insult to . sing along at a normal volume. His performances answer the noise, the . colour and the endless stream of banners and songs cascading down from . all sides of the stadium, responding with crashing challenges, forward . bursts, wonder goals and joyous celebrations. At times, you do worry whether it will . all become too much, whether he will lose the sense of himself at a . pivotal moment, storming into a challenge with excessive haste, . gallivanting over the half-way line without due regard to his defensive . duties. These were the concerns that so . bothered Jose Mourinho, the inherently cautious coach rarely likely to . indulge the defender’s more impulsive tendencies.

Levante’s Keylor Navas was voted the best stopper in Spain last season and last night he proved to the world precisely why, with a series of thrilling saves capped by heroics in the penalty shoot-out. Backed by five nerveless spot-kicks from his team-mates, Navas ensured his tiny Central American nation will take part in their first ever World Cup quarter-final, despite playing for nearly an hour with 10 men against Greece. They responded to misery having been seconds from victory before Sokratis Papastathopoulos appeared unmarked to keep the Greeks in the competition with a stoppage time goal which wiped out the opener scored by Bryan Ruiz. Greece seemed sure to win from this point but Costa Rica dug in, rode their luck it has to be said, relied on their magnificent goalkeeper and won it on penalties.

"Click here to find out more from our brilliant Match Zone service - including Paul Pogba's heat map . Ecuador went out of the World Cup with a display of heroic defiance which shook France, the new contenders for the crown, to their aristocratic roots. The unfancied South Americans blazed another thrilling episode into this magnificent World Cup even after Manchester United’s Antonio Valencia was sent off early in the second half. That decision by the Ivory Coast referee could not discourage Ecuador from going desperately close to overcoming a French team who have become many people’s latest fancy to return here to the Maracana for the final. A lot of hearts went out with Ecuador as their electric counter-attacks had Didier Deschamps’ men scrambling to keep them out. Tottenham goalkeeper Hugo Lloris was almost as busy in the French goal as the flying Alexander Dominguez at the other end.

When the breathless end came, France were heading for a date with Nigeria, Ecuador for home. However, the concept of this French team as ready to surpass the likes of Brazil and Argentina was not given any added traction.Beneath all the thrills there a was a back story on which the French are building their aspirations. The . battle for Karim Benzema was being joined in earnest by Real Madrid and . Arsenal, even as France breathlessly awaited a further sign that this . man is riding a magic carpet similar to that on which Zinedine Zidane . bore them to World Cup glory. The French regard Le Mistral, the hot . southern wind which comes to them from the deserts of North Africa, as . being full of mystery and wonder.That superstition was heightened . when Zidane, born in Marseilles of Algerian parents, arose to spirit . them to their first world championship in Paris in 1998. Sixteen . years later Benzema, born in Lyon to parents from a deeply spiritual . corner of Algeria, is emerging as their exotic new talisman. To . support that belief, he went into this match against Ecuador’s hopefuls . only one behind the four-goal leaders in the race for the Golden Boot, . Neymar and Lionel Messi. Not that he looked like catching them on this . outing. Still the French see it as another positive omen that on the . very day they formally closed out qualification for the last 16 Zidane . has accepted his first managerial appointment, at the club which is . determined to keep Benzema. Less romantically, the recruitment of Benzema’s idol as coach of their second team is a piece of clever opportunism by Real. The . prospect of working in the same environment as Zidane, on a daily . basis, would make it all the more of a wrench for Benzema to up sticks . and move to north London. A persuasion perhaps as great as the hugely . enriching new contract with which Real are preparing to welcome him back . to Spain from this World Cup. It counters the attraction to Benzema of playing under Arsene Wenger, the iconic French manager at the Emirates. VIDEO France fans optimistic about knockout stage .

Holding on: Alexander Dominguez of Ecuador makes a save as France threaten to break the deadlock .

Arsenal . are hoping also that one of their moles in the French camp, Olivier . Giroud, can excite Benzema to the possibility of them partnering each . other in the Premier League the way they work together for France. Albeit . not from the off in this game, in which Benzema was nudged forward . positionally to orthodox centre-forward and Giroud rested. But these . players will not be able to resist comparing two contracts, Giroud’s . existing deal at Arsenal and the bonanza being offered for Benzema to . keep playing his club football in Spain. And it has to be doubtful if . Arsenal will be either willing or able to match such astronomic wages, . especially if Benzema pushes them yet higher with more goals in these . finals. Such has Benzema’s impact been on this shimmering tournament . already that the French have as good as forgotten the grief which . consumed their nation when Franck Ribery was taken from them by injury. Ribery, after all, had been described by Zidane as ‘the new jewel of French football’. But . this team came into this tournament sparkling without him, so . brilliantly in their first two games that they have begun daring to . dream of winning their second World Cup. Ecuador have brought a . little perspective to that notion. They entered the Maracana expecting . that if they were to join Les Bleus they would have to resist being . demolished the way the Swiss were by France in game two of this group. Switzerland, . despite that five-goal hammering, were in pole position to follow . France through as they took on a demoralised Honduras.

Of . the Premier League contingent on view, Newcastle’s Moussa Sissoko . threatened in the early exchanges and Lloris came out smartly to smother . at the feet of Ecuador’s other Valencia. He was to be even busier . later.

A . previously somewhat tepid game was now fully ignited – although the . French still marginally held the upper hand - this firefight  was not in . their script. Lloris had to pull out a huge save from substitute Ibarra to keep it goalless.

"A baby boy died after doctors repeatedly failed to diagnose a life-threatening heart condition, an inquest has heard. Thomas Duffy was 14-months-old when he died after going into cardiac arrest at the Alexandra Hospital in Redditch, Worcestershire in March 2011. A coroner said medics were guilty of a 'gross failure' after they failed to recognise the symptoms of the condition when his parents, Jo and John Duffy, took him into the A&E department as he struggled to breathe. Speaking today, Mr and Mrs Duffy today said that they have finally received justice, following a three-year battle to find out the truth surrounding their infant son's death. The hospital trust responsible has since apologised for the poor standard of care Thomas received. Thomas Duffy died from a cardiac arrest at just 14 months old after doctors repeatedly failed to diagnose an underlying heart condition . Parents Jo and John Duffy, 36 and 39, (pictured with their son Luke) underwent three inquests to battle for a fair and accurate public account of what happened to their son. At the latest inquest, a coroner said medics were guilty of a 'gross failure' An inquest held in June 2011, three months after Thomas' death, found that he died of natural causes. But his parents fought successfully to have the ruling overturned, concerned relevant witnesses were not called to give evidence during the proceedings . A second inquest was held in December last year, but it had to be adjourned due to a problem with the evidence. Mr and Mrs Duffy said they hope that their case will encourage changes to ensure other parents do not suffer what they have been through. They said: 'Thomas was an energetic 14-month-old boy - he was a proper boy. 'He did everything you'd expect him to do the week before going into hospital - he was standing on his rocking chair, climbing up the stairs. 'We wouldn't want any other families to have to go through what we have since Thomas' death and hope by our actions we can help other children and their families in the future.' Thomas was born on January 21, 2010, but within a year his parents were taking him to the GP on a weekly basis for viruses and infections. Two days before he died, Thomas was suffering from vomiting, lethargy, loss of appetite, gagging and retching. Mr and Mrs Duffy took him to the GP as usual, but were reassured by two different family doctors that he was healthy and 'thriving'. Eight hours later he began to struggle to breathe, and Mr and Mrs Duffy rushed to the A&E department at their local hospital. January 21, 2010: Baby Thomas Duffy was born healthy after a normal pregnancy. July 2010: Thomas started to suffer from viral symptoms including a wheeze, a cough and diarrhoea. The GP diagnosed an upper respiratory tract infection (URTI). August 2010 - December 2010: Thomas was repeatedly taken to the GP where doctors diagnosed URTIs, chest infections and bronchiolitis. He was prescribed inhalers and regular antibiotics. January 2011: Thomas became increasingly unwell and his parents were attending his GP surgery on almost a weekly basis. He was never referred for further investigations. February 2011: Thomas deteriorated and suffered from frequent vomiting. He was diagnosed with an ear infection, followed by oral thrush, a URTI and a chest infection throughout February. March 2011: Thomas was suffering from vomiting, lethargy, loss of appetite, gagging and retching. The family were again reassured by the GP on both March 17 and 18. March 19, 2011: Thomas’ breathing became laboured and the family attended A&E. His enlarged heart went undiagnosed and he suffered a cardiac arrest and died. He was treated for a viral induced wheeze and then for sepsis- blood poisoning – as his condition deteriorated. He seemed to improve with the treatment, but hours later suffered a cardiac arrest and died. John Ellery, the assistant coroner in Shropshire concluded that Thomas died from an underlying heart condition that should have been diagnosed much earlier. If appropriate treatment had been given, Thomas would not have died when he did, he added. Mr Ellery, who was sitting at Stourport Coroners Court, said a post-mortem found Thomas was suffering from a condition affecting the main pumping chamber of heart. But he said the life-threatening problem should have been identified by a paediatrician when he was brought into A&E at the Alexandra Hospital. The coroner also criticised the hospital's on-call paediatrician for not attending despite repeated requests by nursing staff - saying it amounted to a 'gross failure'. Mr Ellery said he planned to write to the Trust Development Agency and NHS England to ensure that lessons were learnt from Thomas's death. It was the third inquest Mr and Mrs Duffy have been forced to undergo to get a public account of their son's death, that they felt was accurate and fair. The first inquest was held in June 2011 and came to the conclusion Thomas died of natural causes. But the verdict was quashed by a judicial review brought by the couple, who were concerned relevant witnesses were not called to give evidence. And a second inquest, held in December last year, had to be adjourned due to a problem with the evidence. Speaking after the inquest, Mr and Mrs Duffy said they hoped Thomas's case would prevent other couples from going through a similar ordeal. Mrs Duffy said parents were repeatedly told Thomas's illnesses, including frequent chest infections, were normal for a child of his age. Mr and Mrs Duffy said Thomas was a 'cheeky - a wonderful little boy' 'Every time we went to the GP they said he was a normal, healthy child and he was never referred for a routine hospital appointment' she said. 'On the two days leading up to Thomas's death he was seen twice by the GP and considered a thriving child. 'But just eight to 10 hours later we had to rush him to hospital with severe breathing difficulties. 'On admission Thomas was originally treated for a viral induced wheeze and then for sepsis as his condition deteriorated. 'After a morning of intense treatment we were informed Thomas was in a stable condition but an hour or so later he suffered a cardio-respiratory arrest and died. 'It was only after a post-mortem examination that we learned of Thomas's heart condition.' The couple lived in Bromsgrove in Worcestershire when Thomas passed away in March 2011 but have since moved to Shirley, near Solihull in the West Midlands. After Thomas's death they went on to have another son, Luke, now two, and Mrs Duffy is due to give birth to their third child next month. 'Luke has been our tonic. He was the focus we needed to move on and now we are looking forward to our third baby next month.' the couple said. Paying tribute to Thomas, the couple added: 'Thomas was just amazing. He enjoyed everything about life and he had a wonderful smile - everywhere he went everyone would comment on his beautiful smile. 'He was cheeky - a wonderful little boy.' Penny Venables, chief executive of Worcestershire Acute Hospitals NHS Trust, has now issued an apology to the family. She said: 'We accept the coroner's conclusions and we deeply regret that, in this case, we did get things wrong. 'In the three and a half years since Thomas's death the trust has made significant changes to ensure that the issues highlighted will not be repeated.' She added the coroner had said he was reassured lessons had been learned from Thomas's death and the trust had offered to meet with the parents to discuss measures which had put in place to avoid a repeat of the tragedy. Kay Kelly, a solicitor at Lanyon Bowdler who represented Mr and Mrs Duffy, said: 'The parents of baby Thomas have been forced to go through three separate inquests to gain the answers to their questions as to how and why their beautiful baby son died.' The hospital trust who run the Alexandra Hospital in Redditch, Worcestershire, have apologised to the family and said that they 'did get things wrong'","Thomas Duffy died of a cardiac arrest at a hospital in Redditch in 2011 .

That honour would go to the irrepressible Angel Di Maria. But Messi would emerge as the provider of the all-important pass, delivered to perfection, after an explosive trademark run. For Switzerland it was so, so cruel. For 118 minutes they had more than provided an answer to the best that Argentina could throw at them. They were the better team for the first half, creating much the better chances, and courageous in their defiance after the break. Diego Benaglio, their goalkeeper, was magnificent. As were Fabian Schaer and his colleagues in the Swiss back four. After the first half chances that were so wastefully missed, it made defeat all the more painful for a Swiss team that certainly looks capable of troubling England come those Euro 2016 qualifiers. That said, Hitzfeld will not be in charge and Roy Hodgson can be thankful for that. Because a manager who has twice won the Champions League, who yesterday even had to deal with the tragic news of his brother’s death, proved himself a brilliant tactician here. His side might have conceded five to a rampant France but here, once again, was proof of the impact a top international coach can have on his team. While Hitzfeld encouraged Xherdan Shaqiri to terrorise Argentina’s defence in a manner that delighted the Brazilians whose yellow shirts broke up the sea of blue and white that dominated the Arena De Sao Paulo, he had his more defensive players brilliantly drilled to nullify the attacking threat of Argentina. Di Maria ended up conceding possession 37 times in normal time. Messi found himself surrounded by three or four red shirts every time he was on the ball. Indeed, that burst of speed that saw Messi ride one challenge before knocking that pass into the path of Di Maria represented the first time he had found space between the Swiss midfield and the back four. But as Hitzfield acknowledged afterwards ‘it only take one second for Messi to decide a match’. Readying: The teams waiting to come out before the start of the game .

That it does, but is also doesn’t hide the fact that Argentina remain far too reliant on their captain. Even when he endures what was comfortably his worst performance of the tournament so far. For the Argentina fans it must have been torturous, the goal coming as such a relief to one chap he jumped in the air and proceeded to tumble with quite a thud down the stairs. The fact that he was dressed as The Pope served only to magnify his embarrassment, although his apparent escape from serious injury was nothing short of miraculous. More predictable was the evidence of an imbalance in this Argentina team. Alejandro Sabella might have insisted that the defensive fragility they had shown until now would be addressed. But the Swiss were doing a number on his side, soaking up the pressure and hitting them on the break. Corinthians: The Arena in Sao Paulo packed to the rafters . Watching on: Swiss boss Ottmar Hitzfeld (left) and Argentina coach Alejandro Sabella eyeing the action . Tame: Argentina goalkeeper Sergio Romero saves the attempt of Josip Drmic . Kept out: Romero of Argentina making a save . Stopper: Swiss goalkeeper Diego Benaglio makes a diving save . After a cagey first 25 minutes Granit Xhaka should have tested Sergio Romero more than he did. His shot was way too tame. But if Xhaka was guilty of lacking conviction, it was nothing compared to Josip Drmic when he was sent clear by  a marvellous, defence-splitting pass from Shaqiri. He had only Romero to beat but his left-foot chip was floated meekly into the arms of a relieved Argentina goalkeeper and to the understandable disappointment of Shaqiri. A quick assessment of the 22-year-old Shaqiri: at times it was like watching a young Cristiano Ronaldo with all those step-overs but he really is a super little player. After the break and the Swiss would continue to squander opportunities, with Drmic misfiring after another pass from Shaqiri. Hurting: Di Maria goes to ground . Battle: Josip Drmic of Switzerland fights for the ball with Marcos Rojo . Nerves: The Argentina replacements watch from the bench with the game still at 0-0 . Pains: Benaglio hits the ground injured . Effort: Messi has a pop on goal . By now Argentina were starting to threaten more. Benaglio had to stretch to parry an angled shot from Marcos Rojo, and was more impressive still when he then diverted a close-range header from Gonzalo Higuain over his crossbar. Benaglio would then deny Messi when it seemed the Barcelona superstar had finally carved out an opportunity for himself. The final chance in normal time would nevertheless fall to the Swiss, with Fabian Schaer missing with a header he too should have buried. In extra time, Benaglio would then thwart Ezequiel Garay. Di Maria too. But not in the 118th minute. Not once Messi had intervened and Di Maria had produced what was a fabulous finish. Intake: But it finished goalless after normal time .

"The London marathon has seen racers compete in almost every wacky outfit imaginable over the years - but a mother-of-five is attempting a world first by running the race in high heels. Natalie Eckert hopes to raise £5,000  by completing next year's London marathon in a pair of sparkly five-inch high heels, earning herself a Guinness World Record in the process. The 37-year-old was inspired after hearing about German Julia Plecher earning a place in the Book of Records by running 100m in 14.531 seconds while wearing golden heels. Despite never running a marathon before, Mrs Eckert, from Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, says she is confident of completing the race and has set herself an ambitious target of four hours. Mother-of-five Natalie Eckert plans to become the first person to complete a marathon wearing high heels, despite never having run that distance before . Mrs Eckert, a housewife whose youngest child is just three months old, is currently training by running twice a week wearing a pair of five-inch high heels and going boxing on the other three days . Her training regime consists of running two nights a week and doing boxing on three nights. She added: 'My friends are always laughing at me because I'm always wearing high heels. I wear them all the time, even on the school run. 'I've been known to wear them when I've been pregnant. I absolutely love them. I read about the German lady doing 100m and thought ""that's nothing, she should try a marathon"". 'I have always been into sports, I recently entered into a spinning marathon [on an exercise bike] at the local gym for cancer charities and did well in that so I thought this would be a great challenge. 'I've got 25 weeks to up my training. I started running in heels a few weeks ago but it didn't feel too strange. 'The only problem I think I might have is getting the heel caught in a hole or something like that on the road. 'I would like to do it under four hours. I have never ran a full marathon, the maxiumum distance I have ever done is a half marathon, but I want to set myself an ambitious target. 'The Guinness World Record people said the minimum height is three inches but I thought that was no problem. The smallest pair I have are five inches so I have been training in them anyway. 'It's not as though this is going to be an easy task for me. I'm a mother of five children and my youngest is only a three-month-old baby. It's going to take a lot of hard work and dedication.' Mrs Eckert says she has always been involved in sports and is known among her friends for always wearing high heels - including while she was pregnant . Mrs Eckert is hoping to raise £5,000 for two different charities during the event - and bag herself a spot in the Guinness Book Of World records in the process . Mrs Eckert, a housewife, lives with her husband Kevin, 30, a building site supervisor, and their five children ranging from a three-month-old baby to a 13-year-old teenager. To comply with the Guinness World Record regulations, she will have four pairs of identical stilettos for the big race in London next April. She now hopes to attract a big name sponsor for the marathon and plans to raise over £5,000 in aid of Asthma UK and a charity for bereaved children called Winston's Wish. She added: 'My son who is two has been diagnosed with asthma so I wanted to donate to the charity. I had asthma as a child so I know how bad it can be. 'I have been in touch with Stella McCartney, Jimmy Choo and Victoria Beckham. I'm hoping at least one of them will get back to me. 'I haven't got the pair of shoes I'm going to do the race in yet but I'm hoping Jimmy Choo might donate a pair if I'm lucky. 'I've also contacted Elastoplast. Fingers crossed they get back to me because I'm going to have some huge blisters.'

"Roger Federer put on a show for his fellow sporting superstars as he eased into the second week of Wimbledon without dropping a set. Colombian Santiago Giraldo was Federer's latest victim, the seven-time champion winning their third-round contest 6-3 6-1 6-3 in an hour and 21 minutes. Balanced: Roger Federer took just 81 minutes to beat Santiago Giraldo . David Beckham, Sachin Tendulkar and Sir Bobby Charlton stayed into the evening in the Royal Box to watch the grass-court master at work, and he did not disappoint. Federer's backhand did the damage at the start as the fourth seed moved into a 3-0 lead, and he was untroubled through the rest of the opening set. Giraldo, who was looking to become the first Colombian to reach the fourth round at Wimbledon, needed a good start to the second set but played a woeful service game. Federer, who had called on umpires to tackle time wasting, breezed into a 4-0 lead and nothing was going right for his opponent. Serving to stay in the set, he thought he had served an ace only to be pulled up for a foot fault, and Giraldo then drove a forehand long to hand it to Federer. Delight: Federer was keen to avoid another early exit from SW19 . Disappointment: Santiago Giraldo failed to trouble Federer on saturday . The only moment when Giraldo threatened to get back into the match came in the seventh game of the third set, but Federer saved two break points with big serving. In the next game he broke serve when Giraldo netted a forehand and Federer clinched the final game to love to set up a clash with either Tommy Robredo or Jerzy Janowicz. Federer was more than happy with his victory, saying: 'I got off to a good start and stayed in control until midway through the third set when he had a couple of break points. Waves: Beckham and Sir Bobby Charlton (left) stand to the applause of the Wimbledon crowd . Past, present and future: Boxers Anthony Joshua (left) and David Haye (right) in the royal box . 'Next thing I had break points, I got it done and served it out. I'm very happy. It was a really good match.' Federer joined Andy Murray in reaching round four without dropping a set, and he said: 'I'm very pleased. 'It's always good to keep moving on. I'm aware of the dangers on this surface. You're always worried about the first week. 'For me it's about maintaining a good level. I've got a few niggling things going on but nothing that worries me. I need to keep playing aggressive.'","Seven-time champion put on a masterclass on Centre Court .

"Daniel Ricciardo is smiling. He’s always smiling, but today he has a greater reason than already emerging as the virtuoso performer from this Formula One season, to be happy. It was his birthday. Ricciardo, the only driver outside of Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg, to win a grand prix this season, has reached the grand old age of 25. So, does he have anything planned to celebrate hitting a quarter of a century? ‘No. Not really,’ the Australian says. ‘Perhaps, I’ll get a haircut.’ It’s an answer which may have James Hunt, the 1976 World Champion, whose notoriety for his frivolous conduct away from the track was arguably greater than his displays in a race car, turning in his grave. Birthday boy: Red Bull star Daniel Ricciardo celebrated his 25th birthday on Monday . But Ricciardo, who moved to England to pursue his motor racing career six years ago, insists his partying days are all but a distant memory. ‘I guess when I first came here I was probably 19-years-old, and there was a pretty big group of young kids here who we used to boogie with,’ he says. ‘But my boogie days are over.’ On track, and Ricciardo has played the role of party-pooper at Red Bull this season; expected to be second fiddle to four-times World Champion Sebastian Vettel, following his promotion from the team’s junior outfit Toro Rosso, the Australian has upset the odds. Not only is he ahead of his more established team-mate in the drivers’ championship by 23 points, he has also qualified in front of the German six times from the opening eight races. Indeed, of the four grands prix they have both finished in China, Bahrain, Spain, and Canada - where Ricciardo claimed his maiden grand prix win after passing Rosberg in the most dramatic of finales - he has finished ahead of Vettel on each occasion. All smiles: Riccaiardo shares a laugh with Sebastien Buemi (right) at Daytona Motorsport in Milton Keynes . ‘Coming into a World Championship-winning team you try not to be like that kid on the first day at school, you ease into it,’ Ricciardo explains. ‘But now I feel like I can be who I am and I don’t have to be someone different. ‘Obviously you want to win as soon as you can and to have already done it in the first part of the year was good. I’ve had a lot of great results already this year which has done a lot for me confidence wise, and that just topped it off.’ Unlike his predecessor Mark Webber, who endured a tulmutuous four-year partnership alongside Vettel at Red Bull, Ricciardo enjoys a healthy relationship with the reigning World Champion.‘We do get along outside the car and I think we’ve really handled the year well,’ Ricciardo said. ‘Although in the car it is different. No-one is even close to being a friend when they get in the car.’ Upon his switch to Red Bull, Ricciardo made a deliberate attempt to raise his professionalism, admitting he couldn’t have joined the team and acted ‘like a clown’. Posers: Australian Ricciardo poses next to current British Touring Car Champion Andrew Jordan . But the Australian, eight races into his Red Bull career, admits he still enjoys playing practical jokes away from the cockpit, despite the last laugh usually falling on him. ‘They play jokes on me,’ he says, referring to his team of mechanics. ‘On Sunday mornings, I get in the car and I do a few things in the cockpit. I have to take my shoes off to get in the car. But they glued my shoes together on the floor. I put my feet in the shoes, went to walk off, and nearly face planted. But I’ll get them back, I’m just being patient.’ Ahead of this weekend’s British Grand Prix, Ricciardo is a whopping 83 points adrift of championship leader Rosberg. But does he expect the German, who holds the equivalent of a race victory over Hamilton to win the title? ‘It will all come down to who has got the clearest mind, and who is thinking the straightest on a Sunday,’ he says. ‘Both Nico and Lewis are very evenly paced. Nico has had more luck in terms of reliability, but I think that will all even itself out over the course of the year and if it does it will be the smartest driver who wins. Who that is I don’t know. Nico is a bit more stable and consistent but Lewis, on his day, can be very strong, and if he has more of those days than Nico, then I think that might be enough.’","Daniel Ricciardo insists his partying days are all behind him .

"Click here to see more from our brilliant Match Zone service - including this heat map from Wesley Sneijder . If Holland are to go on and achieve something significant here over the next two weeks then one moment from this extraordinary afternoon in north-east Brazil will be frozen in time. The image — shown afterwards by the host broadcaster here — is of Wesley Sneijder, caught mid-strike, head and knee perfectly over the ball, as he catches an 88th-minute volley flush on the sweet spot of his right boot. It shows a world-class sportsman — no doubt exhausted after an hour-and-a-half of play in extreme conditions — in perfect control of his body, all outside pressures and influences rendered irrelevant by concentration and calm. A moment that saved Holland from expulsion, it would have been ruined had Sneijder shown anything other than the most remarkable assurance. He, of all the people here, knew he was going to score.

This, . though, was a match rescued by a moment of perfection. The heroic . Mexico goalkeeper Guillermo Ochoa — sadly now on his way home — hardly . saw  Sneijder’s shot. It flew past him like a missile. When he watches . it again on TV, maybe he will shrug. The great players, no matter how . poorly they are playing, produce great moments when it matters. And . Sneijder had played badly. He is past his best. South Africa 2010 was . his time. As Holland  rallied, he was outshone by Arjen Robben and, as . strange as it sounds, Dirk Kuyt. If . you have a player like Sneijder, though, you keep him on and you wait. ‘I have seen him deliver  that type of shot so many times in the last . two years,’ said Van Gaal afterwards. ‘He is also one of the fittest . players in the squad.’ Everybody . had to be fit. It was 38 degrees on the field. In the stands, . you needed leather skin. Either that or a big hat.

FIFA . allowed the teams a water break in each half.

Prior to the Mexico goal, Holland had been desperately poor. A . five-man defence that attracts criticism in Holland often resembled an . orange wall of seven as holding midfield players retreated into the . backline whenever Mexico had the ball. All . it did for an hour was invite Mexico to attack, and they did. The . Central Americans could and should have scored in the first half. Miguel . Layun twice threatened from distance and  Hector Herrera had a great . sight of goal  in the 17th minute. Holland, . deprived of the injured Nigel de Jong after only 10 minutes, created . one chance that Robin van Persie wasted with a poor touch and should . have been given a penalty when Robben was fouled by Rafael Marquez and . Hector Moreno in the 44th minute. Van . Gaal’s team needed to improve but it didn’t happen until after Mexico . had scored.

Chances . did come but the Dutch couldn’t take them and when Ochoa somehow saved a . point-blank volley from Stefan de Vrij on the hour, it was tempting to . wonder if it just wasn’t Holland’s day.

"Fresh start? Rebekah Brooks may be being offered a new job by her old boss Rupert Murdoch . Rupert Murdoch may be about to offer Rebekah Brooks a new job at the top of his media empire, it emerged today. Mrs Brooks, 46, has visited the News Corporation headquarters in New York this week 'as she explores and considers her professional future', a company spokesman has confirmed. In June the former News International chief executive was acquitted of all hacking charges and said she had been 'vindicated' after her seven-month trial at the Old Bailey. Mr Murdoch and Mrs Brooks have enjoyed a close relationship and the 83-year-old billionaire is understood to be keen to offer her a new start in the United States. The former News of the World editor is known to have received payouts totalling £16million from his business following her resignation in 2011, including the legal fees for her defence. News Corp staff said last night she was seen being shown around its Sixth Avenue headquarters with an assistant - and a new job was likely discussed. A spokesman for News Corp said: 'She and her family are here in the United States for a visit, reconnecting with friends and meeting with businesses as she explores and considers her professional future.' Mrs Brooks her husband Charlie, 51, who was also cleared of a conspiracy charge at her trial, and their daughter Scarlett, two, would move to New York from Chipping Norton in Oxfordshire. A clue to her destination could be linked to former Daily Telegraph editor Will Lewis, a friend of Brooks, who is now in charge of Mr Murdoch's Dow Jones in New York. Mr Murdoch is said to consider  Mrs Brooks as a fourth child and said famously she was his 'top priority' when the hacking scandal happened and he flew to London. Scroll down for video . Spotted: News Corp have confirmed Mrs Brooks was at its New York headquarters this week 'as she explores and considers her professional future', the company confirmed . Statement: Mrs Brooks last spoke in June after her acquittal but she would not answer questions about her future . When they worked together they went for swims together,  sailed together and spoke on the phone every day. Colleagues described how at almost every meeting he attended in London he would be by her side. Even after she resigned after the News of the World was shut down, Mr Murdoch supported her publicly and they dined together to the fury of staff who lost their jobs. Mrs Brooks last spoke publicly in June, after the end of her trial, and refused to answer any questions about her plans for the future. 'I am innocent of the crimes that I was charged with and I feel vindicated by the unanimous verdicts,' she said. Asked if she could have done more to prevent phone hacking at the News of the World, Mrs Brooks told journalists: 'It's been a time of reflection for me. I've learned some valuable lessons and will hopefully become the wiser for it'. Andy Coulson, Mrs Brooks' successor as editor of the News of the World, was the only defendant convicted of phone hacking by the jury. David Cameron's former spin doctor is serving an 18-month jail sentence for his part in the hacking scandal.","Rupert Murdoch understood to be keen to offer his former editor a new job .

"Cristiano Ronaldo's new zig-zag patterned haircut drew a range of reactions when he unveiled it to the world ahead of Portugal's 2-2 draw with the USA on Wednesday. But according to a story circulating online it seems his new engraving on the right side of his head is less of a fashion statement and more of a kind gesture towards a young boy in Spain. Ronaldo paid Erik Ortiz Cruz's entire £50,000 medical fee as he underwent brain surgery recently and the jagged line incorporated into his new haircut is rumoured to be a nod to the youngster's surgery scars. Viva Ronaldo: The Ballon d'Or winners new haircut might be a hint to his charity work earlier this year . Bizarre: The Portuguese winger showed off his new design for the first time against the USA . Respect: The unconfirmed rumour has been making waves among plenty of CR7 fans on Twitter . Young Erik had his surgery in February this year and Ronaldo's design is believed to mirror the marks made in the operation - although the Real Madrid forward has yet to confirm or deny the claims. However, the Portugal captain very rarely speaks publicly about his charity work and is therefore unlikely to be tweeting to explain his tribute anytime soon.

In a new post penned by airline crew member Sarah Steegar - for travel information website FlyerTalk - she debunked some myths and revealed what it's really like behind the scenes when the cabin lights are dimmed. Speaking about an image from airline company Boeing, Ms Steegar says this representation of the crew looking relaxed as they chat over a cup of coffee is unfortunately for her and many others, a misconception. Scroll down for video . Flight attendant Sarah Steegar, said although people may think this is what breaks look like for cabin crew, the reality is far from it . 'It looks so fun, right?! Like a kid’s treehouse, or a cozy clubhouse where no one can bother us unless it’s an emergency. Heaven! ... If I ever actually find time to do that on a flight, I’ll come back and let you know!' she wrote. Ms Steegar, who has worked for a major US carrier for the past 15 years, goes on to say the 'cute' and 'vintage' scene portrayed never actually takes place, and the reality is much less glamorous. 'What really happens in crew bunks is more like a sprint to see how fast you can throw your body into a horizontal position and slam those eyes shut (and pray for actual sleep, especially if it’s only 6 p.m.). 'If a crew member is lucky (or unlucky) enough to nab the first break, they then need to make the tough decision to either sacrifice precious shut-eye to shovel some food into their mouth or try and sleep through hunger pains. Ms Steegar, a veteran flight attendant, said the rest areas aren't always spacious and comfortable as people think they are . 'And even if they did feel like catching up over a cuppa in the crew rest area, which is often substantially smaller than the public perceive them to be - it would more than likely be poorly received by colleagues.' Ms Steegar also revealed the perils of having to share the rest room with other attendants who are a little more than inconsiderate. 'A certain flight attendant is on my mental hit list for how clumsily he comes into the bunkroom. He’s always 20 minutes late, bangs the door shut and carelessly tosses his shoes to the floor', she wrote. Often the sleeping spaces are tucked away, and sometimes staff have no other option but to take a snooze sitting up behind a curtain . Also addressed was the variation in size of rest areas on aircraft, depending on the size of the plane, the airline company and the length of the flight. Some planes don't even provide beds for the crew, but simply a single seat in a curtained off area of the plane, often just by where the passengers line up to use the bathroom. 'I've spent many a crew ''rest'' with a parade of bums pressed against my shoulder as passengers wait in line for the restroom on the other side of the curtain. Inconsiderate crew members can also be a hassle when attendants are trying to get some shut eye . 'Sometimes I even open my eyes at the sound of snaps being undone, only to see the head of a Curious George passenger poking in to stare at us sleep,' Ms Steegar wrote. She closed the piece with a reiterations that flight attendants certainly don't live a life of luxury lounging around in fancy bunks. 'When we do, it may not have the Boeing Book Club ambiance, but one thing is consistent: we’re intensely grateful for whatever we do get! Like you, I just hope for flights where I can get a horizontal space, even if just for a bit', Ms Steegar revealed.","Sarah Steegar says the crew hardly live a life of luxury behind the scenes .

"The seedy Melbourne hotel that was the scene of an alleged brutal sex attack by a self-proclaimed vampire gigolo has been bought up by The Block. Nine Network bought the Hotel Saville at South Yarra in Melbourne's south-east for $7 million for its popular reality renovation series, according to the Property Observer which claims to have seen sale documents.

The Hotel Saville at South Yarra in Melbourne is believed to have been bought by the Nine Network . The hotel is rumoured to have been bought by popular renovation television series, The Block . But the Property Observer claims the hotel, which features eight floors with 34 apartments, was bought for $6.25 million while the nearby car park used by the hotel was purchased for $1.1 million. The octagonal building features 360 degree views and sits on 940 square metres of land. However, the unique building is infamous for being the scene of male prostitute Shane Chartres-Abbott's alleged attack on a former client in August 2002. He allegedly raped the woman and bit off part of her tongue. The hotel was bought for $6.25 million while a nearby car park used by the hotel was purchased for $1.1 million . Hotel Saville features eight floors with 34 apartments and a a 360 degree view of the city . The unique octagonal building is infamous for being the scene where male prostitute Shane Chartres-Abbott's allegedly attacked a former client in  2002, after claiming to be a vampire . The victim was found unconscious in the Melbourne hotel room, bloodied and beaten, with cuts, burns and bite marks covering her body and a chunk of her tongue missing. A police officer described it as one of the most brutal rapes he had seen. During the trial, the court heard that Chartres-Abbott had told his alleged victim that he was a vampire who needed to drink blood to survive, and he was older than the city of Melbourne. He was gunned down in his front yard as his girlfriend looked on in 2003. Mark Adrian Perry, Warren Shea and Evangelos Goussis were acquitted of orchestrating his murder in the Victorian Supreme Court in July this year.

Built in the 70s, the Hotel Saville was mostly used, in more recent years, by family members visiting patients in the closely located Prince Alfred Hospital. Recent reviews from January and February this year on Trip Advisor, describe the rooms as being 'cheap, dingy, dodgy' and 'dirty' with a lot of noise from the outer streets.

"Shocking footage of a burning firebomb being launched at former celebrity photographer Darryn Lyons’ nightclub has been revealed, as he claims he has repeatedly come under 'attack' since becoming the mayor of his hometown. The one-time Celebrity Big Brother contestant, famous for pink hair and enhanced abs, was elected the 95th mayor of Geelong, in Victoria, on 23 November 2013 but Cr Lyons told the Herald Sun that since then there have 'been various issues'. In the CCTV footage, a man in a white hoody can be seen grabbing the jerry can bomb from the boot of a car parked outside the nightclub. But the bomb goes up in flames on the street after being thrown at the window of the building and lands on the street. Scroll down for video . CCTV shows three men carrying out what is believed to be a firebomb attack on Mayor Darryn Lyons' club . Mayor of Geelong Darryn Lyons (right), seen here with Prime Minister Tony Abbott, says he has become the target of attacks . Describing the attack at his Home House nightclub on Moorabool Street on June 26, Cr Lyons said it could have claimed lives. 'There was no doubt it was a targeted attack. There have been various issues, stuff at home that has caused concern. This was the most serious of the targeted attacks on the mayor,' Cr Lyons told the Herald. Cr Lyons is appealing for help to catch the culprits after police revealed five litres of high-octane Nitro-X fuel, which is only sold at three stores in Victoria, was found at the scene. A Victoria Police spokesperson told Daily Mail Australia: 'Police are investigating a suspicious fire at a Geelong nightclub. 'This happened on 26 June. The blaze caused damage to the footpath and front façade of the building. Detectives are still looking into it.' The CCTV footage films three men arriving outside the nightclub on June 26 . The fire hit the glass window of the club but did not go inside . A man in a white hoody can be seen grabbing the jerry can bomb from the boot of a car parked outside the nightclub . The 48-year-old  won the Mayoral post in Geelong last year, taking 29.9 per cent of the primary vote. The Liberal party member took 70,795 votes after preferences, ahead of his nearest challenger Stephanie Asher by more than 12,600 votes. When he announced his intention to run in the Australian state of Victoria he said he had learned from his time living in Britain that 'every election needs a comedy candidate,' reported The Age. His campaign slogan was 'vision, passion and change,' and he publicised his message with adverts, T-shirts, and a stream of public appearances. Mr Lyons was victorious despite the fact he has lived in Europe for several decades - he arrived in London aged 22. In 1992, Lyons founded picture agency Big Pictures, later gaining notoriety for selling a photograph of David Beckham and Rebecca Loos to the News Of The World. In 2011 he appeared on the UK Celebrity Big Brother during which time bragged of his bedroom antics with a series of famous faces. Cr Lyons' Home House nightclub (pictured) on Moorabool Street was attacked by a firebomb on June 26 . Cr Lyons was elected the 95th mayor of Geelong, in Victoria, on 23 November 2013 . He even claimed to having spent the night with 12 girls at the same time. The paparazzo told model Bobby Sabel: 'I once shared a bed with 12 girls. Those were the crazy days.' On the Channel Five programme in which he came in sixth place, he also debuted his surgically-sculpted six pack. The £4,000 procedure sees fat sucked out of specific areas of the torso to make it look as if the patient has super-toned abdominal muscles without ever hitting the gym. Talking about the procedure, Mr Lyons said: 'I had contouring done to my body. 'I had to get really fit and lose a fair bit of weight. It takes away all the fat around it and actually lets your natural abs be there. 'Basically it's the male version of a boob job.'","CCTV footage shows Darryn Lyons' Home House nightclub allegedly being firebombed .

"Rafael Nadal gritted his teeth, wiped his brow and looked to the sky after  winning on grass for the first time in two years. He had become only the 11th player in the open era to win 700 tour-level matches but his expression told a story of relief, not records, after he battled back to beat Martin Klizan 4-6, 6-3, 6-3, 6-3. The murmurs began among the Centre Court crowd as the Slovakian, unknown to all but the tennis fanatics in attendance, served out to take the first set over the world No 1. After being bundled out in the first round at Wimbledon last year by tour journeyman Steve Darcis, was Nadal about to take another early bow? Tough test: Nadal recovered from a slow start to make it through to the second round . The Spaniard shuffled to his seat, . peeled off his top — much to the delight of some spectators — and could . have been forgiven for posing himself that very question. But . doubts like that are for mere mortals, not for great warriors like . Nadal, who denied his thoughts had wandered to Darcis or Lukas Rosol, . the Czech who knocked him out in 2012. ‘When . you are in a match, you are not thinking about what happened last year . or two years ago,’ he said, ‘You’re thinking about the next point, . you’re thinking about finding a solution for that match.’ In a  curious . twist, Nadal will face Rosol in the next round, the same stage at which . the Czech triumphed in a five-set blockbuster. But Nadal is not one to . entertain talk of bogeymen. ‘I lost because he’s a good player,’ he . said. ‘He plays very well on this surface and it will be a tough match . again. I know if I want to have chances to win, I need to play very . well.’ Klizan might be 51 . in the world — 50 places behind Nadal — but he is no slouch, as . evidenced by his ATP Newcomer of the Year award in 2012 and the way he . attacked from the first point. The . 24-year-old immediately raced to three break points, which Nadal saved. But the Spaniard was broken in the ninth game of the set and looked . jaded, perhaps feeling the effects of the run to his 15th Grand Slam . title at Roland Garros earlier this month. Pure delight: Nadal celebrates his win as he looks to win another Wimbledon title . Effort: Nadal needed to draw on his reserves to book his place in the next round . VIDEO Wimbledon Day 2 review . In . Halle last week he lost to world No 78 Dustin Brown and admitted he is . struggling to make the transition from clay to grass with only two weeks . between the conclusion of the French Open and the start of Wimbledon. ‘Mentally . and physically you play a long clay-court season,’ he said. ‘If you are . able to win Roland  Garros, you have already played for a long time at . your top level —  mentally and physically. It is  normal to go down a . little bit. The grass deserves to have one more week, as it will next . year. For the players who are able to play very well and long on clay, . having this extra week will help. ‘It . is always a bit more dangerous physically when you are finishing Roland . Garros on Sunday and you have to play again on Wednesday. ‘It’s . tough to make the right preparation for the tournament. You don’t have a . lot of time to prepare and to play matches on grass but the best . players are able to do it.’ Nadal . looked the least comfortable of the top four in the opening round but . once he has battled through the early stages and found his feet on the . greens of SW19, you sense a third Wimbledon title could be on the cards. He would become only the  second man after Bjorn Borg to win at Roland . Garros and Wimbledon in the same year on three occasions. Pumped up: Nadal was his usual expressive self on court . This . was a workmanlike and confidence-boosting  victory for Nadal after more . than three hours on court but  there were some magic moments. In the . fourth set he slipped, got up and smacked a backhand diagonally which . dipped inside the line to set up a break point, which he duly converted . for the double break. Klizan . fought valiantly, got one break back and forced Nadal to save a break . point as he served  out for the match. First round  victories for world . No 1s are rarely  celebrated so expansively. lLleyton . Hewitt completed his 13th first-round victory at Wimbledon with a 6-2, . 6-7 (14-16), 6-1, 6-4 win over world No 120 Michal Przysiezny. Now . aged 33, this could be his final competitive visit here and he will . face against 15th seed and 2013 semi-finalist Jerzy Janowicz tomorrow. Close: Martin Klizan couldn't keep up his effort and lost in four sets . The . Australian made it clear after his victory  how much he enjoys . Wimbledon, saying: ‘It doesn’t get any  better than playing in this . tournament, Physically I’ve come through a few things over the last . couple of years with surgeries ...but it’s all worth it out here.’ Only . three times in his 16 visits has Hewitt fallen at the first hurdle, and . in 2002 he won the title,  beating the now-retired David Nalbandian. There . are only four other former champions in the men’s draw, and the one in . Hewitt’s quarter is  seven-time winner Roger Federer. ‘I . came out being really aggressive and played a great first set, and then . it’s always tough because you’ve got to start again.’ Hewitt said. ‘Fitness-wise I felt fine.’","Rafael Nadal beat Martin Klizan after losing the first set .

Suarez last summer. The only negotiation remained the structure of the . payment particularly once it became clear that Alexis Sanchez did not . wish to be part of the transfer. Suarez . is now facing a fight to appeal his four-month ban, described by his . lawyer as ‘draconian, totalitarian and fascist’ with an appeal going to . the Court of Arbitration for Sport. Decision: Suarez has 10 days to request the full written reasons for the appeal being rejected by FIFA . The . ban prohibits Suarez from attending football matches, training with . Uruguay or his club and attending functions organised by his team — a . penalty now borne by Barcelona. Suarez’s . lawyer Alejandro Balbi said: ‘We hope they revoke this sanction that is . blatantly draconian, totalitarian and  fascist. The right of a . footballer to work is being violated, and football should be worried . about that. The nine international games may seem excessive, but the . fact that he can’t watch a game of football, or train or carry out his . job, we are talking about unpleasant things. ‘Luis recognised his error but we’ve seen that for FIFA saying sorry is not an important factor,’ added Balbi. ‘Justice . will take its time but it will come. We knew that FIFA would uphold the . ban because they are corporatists. We will not stop, we are going to go . to the CAS and we will keep taking the juridical path that is available . to us.’ For Liverpool, Suarez is no longer their problem.

"Suddenly it feels different. Speculation about Luis Suarez’s future is nothing new but this time, almost in the blink of an eye, his departure from Liverpool seems inevitable. ‘Why?’ you will ask. Liverpool, after all, have not been approached by any club in Europe about Suarez since Arsenal’s ham-fisted £40million plus £1 offer last July nor has he personally told Brendan Rodgers or members of Anfield’s hierarchy that he wants to leave. Furthermore, the impression in the dressing room is that Suarez wants to give Liverpool 12 more months, to sample Champions League nights at Anfield and help the club attempt to go one place better after that remarkable pursuit of the Barclays Premier League trophy last season.VIDEO Scroll down to see Uruguay hero Suarez get serenaded by his team-mates . All smiles: Luis Suarez in training with Uruguay ahead of their pivotal World Cup clash with Italy . Emotion: Suarez celebrates scoring the dramatic late winner against England . Bundle: His brace kept Uruguay in with a chance of qualifying from Group D . With Suarez, though, you can never relax and the last few days have proven that momentum is building. Liverpool have done all they can to keep him, making the 27-year-old the highest paid player in their history when they offered him a new contract last December, but it seems as if the point has been reached where they can do no more. If Suarez’s comments after he put England to the sword in Sao Paolo set alarm bells ringing, the flurry of stories in El Mundo Deportivo – the influential Barcelona-based newspaper – and words from his father-in-law Gustavo Balbi ('this is the right time for him to move,' he told Spanish TV show La Sexta) suggest this is a fight Liverpool cannot win. They were outstanding 12 months ago when he tried to engineer a move to Arsenal. Brendan Rodgers handled a difficult situation with aplomb, while principal owner John W Henry stood up to player power and maintained unequivocally that Suarez wouldn’t get his way. But what do they do this time? Today’s edition of El Mundo Deportivo reports that negotiations 'are about to begin with Liverpool for Suarez' to make him 'the stellar signing for Barcelona’s 2014/15 campaign'. Gearing up: Suarez in a press conference before the vital Group D showdown . Puffed out: Suarez and his team-mates looking tired at the end of a session . Liverpool have had no dialogue with Barcelona but the level of detail in the story includes reference to that Raul Sanllehi – a man who was influential Neymar’s last summer – will be instrumental if and when the time comes for negotiations to begin. For the moment, however, all Liverpool can do is wait and see what unfolds. At face value, Suarez is still a Liverpool player representing his country at the World Cup but it is impossible to escape the feeling that, very soon, something will happen that will transform the situation. Who knows? Something could even happen tonight. Suarez is bound to be asked a question if he stops in the Mixed Zone after Uruguay’s showdown with Italy in Natal and given how comfortable he feels speaking to his compatriots, that is where the key answer may be found. Should that be the case, Liverpool will have no option but to act quickly and decisively. For all that Rodgers, Henry et al excelled in the face of last year’s saga, they could do without another one following them around and dominating the agenda once more. July is going to be a busy enough month for Rodgers as it is, with friendlies to play in Copenhagen, Preston, Boston, Chicago, New York and then Charlotte and the last thing he will want is to be giving daily updates on Suarez’s future. This time, if Barcelona do come calling, the key is to get the maximum they can out of the deal and have it concluded as swiftly as possible. They do not want to fall into the same trap as Tottenham did with Real Madrid and Gareth Bale and still be negotiating with deadline day looming. Heartache: Suarez sits in disbelief after Liverpool throw away a three-goal lead against Crystal Palace . Embrace: Being consoled by Steven Gerrard as Liverpool's title dream slipped away at Selhurst Park . Duo: Reds fans wlll be desperately hoping it's not the last they see of these two together . Selling Suarez is not a decision that will be made easily. He is a sublime talent, comfortably keeps company with the top five in world football, and is blessed with that magical quality of being able to produce those moments of fantasy that others can only dream. Those who have watched him at Anfield for the last three-and-a-half years will tell tales to their grandchildren in the years to come about the magic of the man from Salto who upheld the tradition of the club’s fabled No 7 shirt and almost made Liverpool champions. For that reason, Liverpool will fight until the very end to keep Suarez on Merseyside. But the problem they have is the identity of the suitor. When Barcelona and Real Madrid set their mind to acquiring a player, the chase only ends one way and Liverpool know this better than most, given what happened in the past with Javier Mascherano, Xabi Alonso and Steve McManaman. Barcelona can pay Suarez a king’s ransom after losing high wage earners such as Carles Puyol, Cesc Fabregas and Victor Valdes – Xavi is also likely to leave – while they need to make a statement after seeing their bitter rivals Madrid win the Champions League last month. The statement they want to make is Luis Suarez – and that is why it feels inevitable this story is heading for one conclusion.","Barcelona are closing in on Liverpool superstar Luis Suarez .

"Brendan Rodgers and the Liverpool fans are partly to blame for Luis Suarez’s latest bite. By throwing his arms around Suarez last summer, Rodgers got the best out of the player, but he also fed his ego. The fans forgot the Ivanovic bite, they swept away memories of Suarez openly saying he wanted to leave Liverpool, and they chose to ignore the fact that Suarez downed tools on his return to Melwood after the Confederations Cup. Suarez was allowed to get away with lots of bad stuff, and was treated as a legend, simply because he scored lots of goals.

Just a quick check back through the history books confirms that you have to do a little bit more than finish second to be a Liverpool legend. And it may be the lack of title success in the modern era that has lowered standards at Anfield, but those fans should ask more of their players on and off the pitch. The irony is that the points dropped in the games Suarez missed because of suspension at the start of last season cost Liverpool the title. That ban came back to bite Liverpool on the shoulder. The season of adulation Suarez enjoyed gave him God-like status in his own mind coming into the World Cup. The crisis when he was injured fed the ego even more, and the desperation to have him back after Uruguay lost to Costa Rica gave Suarez a head the size of South America. End of the road: Suarez returned home after being banned from football for four months . Ovation: Suarez returned home to a hero's welcome despite his ban for biting the Italian defender . Previous: Suarez was banned for biting Branislav Ivanovic during Liverpool's game against Chelsea at Anfield . Two goals and a victory later, Suarez was the self-appointed King of the World Cup. He taunted the English and punished us all - in his world. And then, just when it looked like Uruguay were going out of the tournament, frustration set in and Suarez’s 'God status' was threatened. He lashed out, he regressed to childhood and bit an opponent. Again. What would Bill Shankly have said about that bite? Well he probably wouldn’t have said anything because I suspect he would have sent Suarez packing after the bite on Ivanovic last year, described by Brendan Rodgers as an 'unfortunate incident.' Seeing is believing: Suarez was named Player of the Year after his form helped Liverpool to second place . Regular: The Uruguayan scored 31 Premier League goals last season and nearly guided Liverpool to the title . Faith: Brendan Rodgers made Suarez Liverpool captain at Tottenham, a game they won 5-0 . VIDEO Suarez family say he should leave Liverpool . When it comes to finding the right words, there are few from the footballing world who get close to matching the articulation of Shankly the great, so Rodgers has a tough act to follow. The Liverpool boss has shown admirable deference to Shankly, and made attempts to follow his lead. The short-termism shown by Rodgers in his treatment of Suarez has taken Liverpool back into the Champions League, but it’s also damaged the reputation of this special club. Shankly wouldn’t have stood for that. The great man once tore into Tommy Smith for wearing a bandage at training, so you can only imagine what he would have thought of a Liverpool player biting an opponent. Back in December, Brendan Rodgers made Luis Suarez captain of Liverpool for their Premier League game at Tottenham. The manager explained the decision by saying he wanted: '…someone who could represent me and the club.' Spat: Suarez was also banned for racially abusing Manchester United's Patrice Evra in October 2011 . Shake on it? Suarez and Evra didn't shake hands at a Premier League meeting at Old Trafford in 2012 . Stand by your man: Suarez was brought to Anfield by Liverpool legend Kenny Dalglish . That is surely no longer the case. Remember when Suarez made Kenny Dalglish look a fool over the Evra handshake? If a player thinks it’s acceptable to do that to a legend like Dalglish, he’s not fit to represent the club. Liverpool fans have forgiven Suarez too many times. They should now sell him, and trust their manager to spend the money wisely. Liverpool Football Club has always held its head up high. But you can only hang that head in shame when one of your players has a habit of biting opponents. Time to let Luis Suarez walk on through his storm, and not damage the great name of Liverpool anymore.","Luis Suarez was treated like a legend despite his previous incidents .

A family spokesman identified the woman's husband and daughter, who held hands on their way into the church, but he kept reporters away from the building. About 450 people attended, said Tony Vann, the spokesman. Apart from a statement released Wednesday, the family hasn't spoken publicly about Hufford's death. 'Losing our mom, wife and grandmother has been one of the most difficult challenges any of us have faced in our lives,' the statement said. 'For her life to have been taken in such a tragic act of violence adds a depth of grief we are trying to comprehend.' At the church Friday, around a dozen mourners wore jerseys bearing the logos of the Oklahoma City Blazers and Barons as a tribute to Hufford, remembered as a regular patron, with her husband, of the city's minor league hockey teams. Former Blazers coach Doug Sauter was among those attending. 'She was loved and liked by everyone,' Sauter told The Oklahoman newspaper this week. 'They enjoyed the games so much. It will be hard to see that empty seat.' Fundraising effort: As of Friday, people had pledged more than $8,400 to the family of Colleen Hufford to show their support. She is pictured here with her husband, K.C. Hufford . Charged: Alton Nolen, 30,  has been charged with first-degree murder in the beheading of his Vaughan Foods plant co-worker, Colleen Hufford, on September 25 . The cover of her funeral program included the logo of the Barons, the city's current team, and was decorated in the team's blue color. Police this week arrested one of Hufford's co-workers, Alton Nolen, 30, after he was released from a hospital. Officers said the plant's chief operating officer, Mark Vaughan, who is also a reserve sheriff's deputy, shot Nolen with a rifle to stop him as he attacked Traci Johnson, 43, who had complained that Nolen had made racial remarks at work. Police said Vaughan Foods' human resources department suspended Nolen September 25 and that he went home, retrieved and knife and returned to the plant. According to an arrest affidavit, he attacked Hufford from behind, severing her head, and attacked Johnson, too, until Vaughan intervened. Prosecutors have filed paperwork saying they'll seek Nolen's execution if he's convicted. Cleveland County District Attorney Greg Mashburn has said he made that decision to seek the death penalty after meeting with Hufford's family. Beloved: Colleen Hufford (far right) is pictured with her husband KC, daughter Kelli and granddaughter Riley . amily: Colleen's family and friends have set up a tribute page on Facebook and are asking people to donate to charity.

Because the attack followed a series of high-profile videotaped beheadings by Islamic State militants in the Middle East, Moore police asked the FBI to help investigate. Friends started an online fundraising effort to help Hufford's family. As of Friday, people had pledged more than $8,400 toward the goal of $10,000. The Great Falls (Montana) Tribune and The Oklahoman reported this week that Hufford, then Colleen Thompson, was a 1978 graduate of Great Falls High School.

"Why can’t we all sing as well as Taylor Swift or Michael Bublé? While most believe you're born with - or without -  the talent, research suggests being a good vocalist is simply a matter of 'practice makes perfect'. Experts say that we all have the ability to sing well and, just like how going to the gym improves everyone's physique, a person's singing skills can be trained to a reasonably high level. ‘The voice can be trained in just about everyone,’ she quotes Justin Stoney of the New York Vocal Coaching in New York City as saying. Pictured is Taylor Swift in St Louis, Missouri last year . Dana Dovey writing for Medical Daily found that there were less obstacles than thought in getting a good singing voice. ‘The voice can be trained in just about everyone,’ said Justin Stoney of the New York Vocal Coaching in New York City as saying. ‘The evidence that we have says that if you really apply good technique, just about anyone can sing well.’ As you inhale your diaphragm contracts, drawing air into your lungs, and vice-versa. Exhaling forces air through the vocal folds, which can vibrate very quickly. This process creates a vocal sound as you expel breath. Along the vocal tract, various structures can shape this sound into words and even carry a tune. Dovey cites a 2012 study by the University of Montreal that found 35 per cent of people struggled with pitch - while others have different ‘musical deficiencies’. Some people are also physically better built to sing, with structure of the vocal chords and larynx, in addition to the size of their skull, determining how a person sounds. For these people, they will find it quicker and easier to become better singers. Indeed a study by the Journal of Medical Genetics found as much as half of musical talent may come from nature rather than nurture. But the environment a person is brought up in also plays a part, says Mr Stoney; being exposed to music or playing instruments from a young age can help a person learn to sing well. Some people are born with better voices and learn quicker. As you inhale your diaphragm contracts, drawing air into your lungs, and vice versa. Along the vocal tract, various structures can shape this sound into words and even carry a tune when you exhale (illustrated) Earlier this year a study aimed to find which singer had the greatest vocal range. Website concerthotels.com plotted the vocal range of singers widely considered to be the best, alongside contemporary artists nominated for last weekend's Billboard Music Awards. The list features the likes of Michael Jackson, Whitney Houston and Aretha Franklin but the singer who topped the chart was Guns N’Roses frontman Axl Rose, followed closely by Mariah Carey. According to the chart, Rose covers five octaves ranging from F1 on There Was A Time, from the 2008 album Chinese Democracy, up to Bb6 on Ain’t It Fun from the 1991 album 'The Spaghetti Incident?'. Although Mariah Carey has the highest note of the group, hitting G7 in 1991 hit Emotions, she is in second place to Rose’s range.

"A Christmas Day diner died and dozens of others became seriously ill after eating their turkey lunch at a pub where staff paid 'lip service' to safety procedures, a court heard today. Mother-of-one Della Callagher, 46, died after paying £39.95 for the four-course lunch at the Railway Hotel, Hornchurch, Essex, on Christmas Day 2012. She was among 33 people who fell ill following the alleged outbreak of food poisoning, later attributed to a bacteria known as Clostridium perfringens. The restaurant's former owner Ann McSweeney, 40, and ex-chef Mehmet Kaya, 37, deny serving food that was unfit for human consumption. Ann-Marie McSweeney (pictured, left) is on trial accused of serving food unfit for human consumption in her pub after mother Della Callagher (right) died . Today, John Callagher, 53, described his wife's 'horrific' death, describing the moment she began shaking and rolled her eyes back while lying in bed next to him. Mr Callagher, who breathed deeply throughout his evidence and sipped at a glass of water to keep his composure, said that his wife was in a 'great mood' on Chistmas Day because she loved being with her family. He told the court that his wife began to feel unwell at around 5:30am on Boxing Day and he started to feel unwell about an hour later. Mr Callagher said: 'We both had the same symptoms, but Della got progressively far worse than me as we went throughout the day, with vomiting, diarrhoea and stomach pain. 'I called my mother-in-law, and said ""you've got to come to the house"". 'I was getting increasingly concerned as the day went on. The vomiting and diarrhoea wouldn't stop and Della was a very private person, and it was horrific to see what was going on. 'My mother-in-law called NHS Helpline first and that didn't seem to work, whatever that was, and then the paramedics were called by 999. 'My symptom's were nowhere near as bad as Della's. They gave her Diarolyte. 'Della was in quite a state physically so they took her in an ambulance to Queen's Hospital, Romford.' He told the court that because of his food poisoning, he wasn't well enough to go with his wife. He said: 'I couldn't. I wasn't in the physical state to go. My mother-in-law went and I think my brother-in-law joined them later at the hospital. 'The next thing I discovered, they were back at my house, my brother-in-law is a black taxi driver and he brought them back.' He continued: 'They didn't take her in A&E because I think they were concerned it was the norovirus, even though it was clear - the paramedics said to me: ""this looks like salmonella."" More than 30 diners fell ill with food poisoning after the meal at the Railway Hotel in Hornchurch, Essex . 'They gave her a shot of something in the ambulance. They [A&E] sort of turned her away.' He said she seemed a bit better, but in the afternoon or early evening she took a turn for the worse. Mr Callagher said: 'She got far, far, far, worse. It was horrific.' He said he called his mother-in-law again, asking her to come back to the house, adding: 'I didn't know what to do. 'I called my mother-in-law and she was going to come round and I was holding Della on the bed because I didn't want vomit to go down her throat, and she would choke.' He added: 'Something changed. I felt her physically shake and her eyes rolled, as if she was having a cardiac arrest.' He claimed that the ambulance took more than 45 minutes to arrive, as somebody instructed his brother how to do CPR. He said: 'We had someone on the line who was instructing us to do CPR. My brother-in-law was giving her CPR and trying to save her, but there was no sign of life. 'My mother-in-law was very ill by this point. The paramedics took over and we went downstairs to let them do their job. We hoped for a different outcome, but she hadn't breathed now for 45 minutes. 'Paramedics took my brother-in-law outside and I think they was going to say she was clinically gone, and they then felt a pulse and they took her to hospital.' Mr Callgher told the court that this time he travelled in the ambulance with his wife, regardless of his own condition. He said: 'It didn't matter to me what state I was in. 'I left with her and my mother-in-law left in a different ambulance.' Mrs Callagher was pronounced dead at the hospital on December 27th at around 08:15am. The pub's parent company, Mitchell and Butlers PLC, based in Birmingham, also deny the charge at Snaresbrook Crown Court. McSweeney, of Hornchurch, and Kaya, of  Purfleet, Essex, also deny perverting the course of justice by falsifying records in a 'daily kitchen due diligence log' relating to the cooking and cooling of turkey meat. The pair are accused of failing to properly monitor the temperature of the turkey as it cooked. Following the incident, they allegedly falsified their food safety records to hand to health and safety inspectors. McSweeney further denies obstructing an officer in the course of their duty by handing the falsified documents to food safety inspectors. Andrew Campbell-Tiech, prosecuting, told the court: 'Mehmet Kaya grossly, grossly mismanaged the preparation of the Christmas turkey. 'By that act he caused his employer, the company, to place unsafe food before its customers on Christmas Day. Mrs Callagher, who tragically later died, was initially seen at Queen's Hospital in Romford, pictured . 'Miss McSweeney was in overall charge. She knew, she must have known, that Mr Kaya did not follow safety procedures. Her default is clear, she should have intervened. She did not.' Referring to the charge of perverting the course of justice, Mr Campbell-Tiech said: 'The actions of Miss McSweeney and Mr Kaya in the immediate aftermath of this tragedy were not those of innocent actors caught up in a tragedy not of their making. 'News of a possible food poisoning outbreak reached The Railway Hotel sometime in the morning on Boxing Day. Carole Rowe, a diner, had returned to the hotel to complain.' He added: 'Miss McSweeney contacted the company, who by 1pm on Boxing Day were aware that six people had reported illness. 'Environmental Health Officers attended on the 27th and, by that time, all trace of the Christmas meal had disappeared. There were no samples for the officers to seize.' He continued: 'Clearly the turkey breasts were cooked and cooled, otherwise they could not have been reheated and served the following day, Christmas Day. But when and for how long, we simply do not know.' Mr Campbell-Tiech claimed the kitchen logbooks showed 'the kitchen of The Railway Hotel paid lip service only to the systems the company had prescribed but did not enforce'. The trial continues. The bacterium Clostridium perfringens is widely distributed in the environment and food. It is the third most common cause of food poisoning in the UK. If spores of the bacteria survive cooking, they can germinate to form growing cells. Spores cannot grow in a refrigerator or freezer but thrive at room temperature. In optimal growing conditions, the organism has a generation time of 10 to 12 minutes. When a large number of the vegetative cells are consumed this will more-likely-than-not lead to gastroenteritis. Food poisoning from the bacteria most often occurs when foodstuffs, usually red meat or poultry, is prepared in advance and kept warm for several hours before serving. The illness, with diarrhoea and abdominal pain the main symptoms, generally lasts for less than 24 hours but elderly people may be more seriously affected. The bacteria is also responsible for 80-95 per cent of gas gangrene cases, a rare but severe form of gangrene.

"The jurors in a Polo millionaire's retrial for DUI manslaughter will not see the two cars at the center of the crash that killed a 23-year-old student, it was today revealed. John Goodman, 50, was sentenced to 16 years in prison in May 2012 after being convicted of killing Scott Wilson in a drunken hit-and-run in Wellington, Florida, in February 2010. But a retrial is currently underway after the tycoon's initial conviction was thrown out when a mistrial was declared because of juror misconduct. Scroll down for video . Alleged manslaughter: John Goodman (left), 50, was sentenced to 16 years in prison in May 2012 after being convicted of killing student Scott Wilson (right) in a drunken hit-and-run in Wellington, Florida, in 2010 . Wrecked: But a retrial is currently underway after the tycoon's initial conviction was thrown out. In the retrial, the jurors will not see the $200,000 Bentley (pictured) that Goodman was driving at the time of the crash . In the case, the new jury will not be shown the $200,000 Bentley that Goodman was driving when he allegedly ran a stop sign and smashed into Mr Wilson's car at speed, sending it into a canal. They will also not see the Hyundai that the engineering graduate was travelling in when he plummeted into the water and drowned, according to ABC. This is because officials ordered the release of the two vehicles after Goodman, the founder of the International Polo Club Palm Beach, was convicted in his first trial. The cars were crushed. 'His car was a crucial piece of evidence in the first case,' said ABC News legal analyst Dan Abrams. Crumpled: They will also not see the Hyundai (pictured)  that Mr Wilson, an engineering graduate, was travelling in when he was struck by Goodman's vehicle. The student then plunged into a canal and drowned . Surveying the damage: This is because officials ordered the release of the two vehicles after Goodman (pictured with his damaged Bentley) was convicted in his first trial. The cars were to be crushed . 'This is a much better case for the defense this time around.' Earlier this week, Palm Beach Homicide Detective Troy Snelgrove told the new jury that Goodman appeared inebriated with watery eyes and slurred speech in the hours after the fatal crash. At the time, the millionaire's blood alcohol level was measured at .177 percent, more than twice the legal driving limit, and he smelt strongly of the substance, he said. Meanwhile, a local bartender testified that Goodman bought 18 drinks before the crash, including tequila shots and a vodka drink, but said he shared them between friends. On trial: Earlier this week, Palm Beach Homicide Detective Troy Snelgrove told the new jury that Goodman (seen, left, in court) appeared inebriated with watery eyes and slurred speech in the hours after the crash . Tragic: Goodman said he left the scene because he was not aware he had hit the University of Central Florida graduate (pictured with his mother), who was driving home to Wellington to visit his family at the time . Evidence presented in court showed that the mogul's bill at the venue came to around $272. However, Goodman's lawyers claimed that he was not driving while drunk, but instead had a drink following the incident to calm his nerves. During his testimony, Snelgrove also told the court that investigators had recreated the impact of the crash, which saw the 3,600lb Bentley slam into Mr Wilson's much lighter car at 63mph. If Goodman is convicted again of DUI manslaughter and vehicular homicide, he faces 16 years in prison . 'The vehicle was registered in Texas, which means it had a front license plate on it,' he said, according to Local10.com. 'When the Bentley came through the intersection and struck the Hyundai, it actually left the imprint of the numbers on the license plate on the front wheel.' Speaking in the first trial, Goodman claimed his brakes had malfunctioned before the crash. 'I began to apply my brakes, and the car did not seem to be stopping as easily as I was used to,' he said. He added that he left the scene because he was not aware he had hit the University of Central Florida graduate, who was driving home to Wellington to visit his family at the time. He told the court that if he had known, he 'would have done whatever I could have done to help'. In a stunning move in March 2012, Goodman tried to adopt his girlfriend Heather Hutchins, 44, which would have entitled her to a large amount of his children's $300million trust fund. The adoption papers stated that Ms Hutchins, who has been dating the millionaire since 2009, was entitled to at least a third of his trust, according to the Palm Beach Post. At the time, Wilsons' attorney, Scott Smith, said Goodman was attempting to use the adoption to shield his assets. A Miami appeals court later ruled that the businessman could not adopt Ms Hutchins. Goodman's appeal for a retrial was granted after juror Dennis DeMartin, 69, was found guilty of misconduct after not disclosing his ex-wife's DUI during jury selection. Couple: In  March 2012, Goodman tried to adopt his girlfriend Heather Hutchins. Above, the couple together . Lap of luxury: The International Polo Club, which Goodman founded, attracts a range of A-list celebrities . 'A juror who deceives to get on a jury in a high profile case for his own profit is a trial lawyer's worst nightmare,' Goodman's attorney Roy Black wrote in a statement at the time. The new jury was selected in Tampa and brought to West Palm Beach because of the publicity that the high-profile trial attracted initially. Jurors are being kept away in a hotel. If Goodman is convicted again of DUI manslaughter and vehicular homicide, he faces 16 years in prison. He has pleaded not guilty to the charges.","Tycoon John Goodman, 50, convicted of DUI manslaughter in May 2012 .

"It was the most shameful hour in the history of German football. Ten minutes into their final group game of the 1982 World Cup in Spain, Horst Hrubesch put West Germany 1-0 up against neighbours Austria. It was a scoreline that would send both teams through to the following round. From that moment on, the two sides honoured an implicit non-aggression pact. Neither side made any significant attempt to score. Disgrace: West Germany's (centre) victory against Austria in the 1982 World Cup has forever been tarnished . Bad pact: The 1-0 win ensured both sides qualified for the next round, whilst Algeria were knocked out . Sham: Horst Hrubesch (left) scored West Germany's goal in their 1-0 win against Austria in the 1982 World Cup . For over an hour, the whole stadium in Gijon provided a soundtrack of whistles and boos. Both German and Austrian television commentators apologised to viewers on behalf of their teams. But it didn’t help. The game finished 1-0. Algeria, the unfortunate victims of the disgrace, were knocked out, left only to fume at the terrible injustice. Thirty two years on, and Germany is beginning to worry that the ‘Scandal of Gijon’ might happen again. In the zone: The current Germany World Cup squad are focused on avoided a repeat of the 1982 fiasco . Thursday sees the current German side play their final group game of the 2014 tournament. They face the USA. A draw would see both teams progress, with Germany topping the group. The fear of a repeat of Gijon is not as irrational as it might seem. Germany and the USA are practically cousins in footballing terms. In Jermaine Jones, Fabian Johnson, John Anthony Brooks, Julian Green and Timothy Chandler, the US have five squad members who played in the Bundesliga last season. All five of them were born in Germany, and three of them - Johnson, Brooks and Green – played for German national youth teams, before deciding to switch allegiances to the US. Johnson even won a major trophy with the Germany U21s. In 2009, he conquered Europe alongside Mesut Ozil, Sami Khedira and Manuel Neuer, all of whom he will meet again on Thursday. And who could forget the coach? Jürgen Klinsmann is not just a German, he is the man who, between 2004 and 2006, revolutionised the German national team. He laid the foundations for the exciting, youthful Germany set up we see today. After the 2006 World Cup he handed the reins to his right hand man: Joachim Low. Switching allegiances: USA's Timothy Chandler (left) and Jermaine Jones (right) were both born in Germany . Klinsmann and Low belong together. They are Jogi and Klinsi: the stylish revolutionaries, who still stay in touch, sharing tips and keeping each other on their toes. As far as their next encounter goes, however, all parties insist that there will be no Gijon-style pact between the two teams. Klinsmann has said that he and Löw have not contacted each other. ‘This is no time to be calling your friends. It’s down to business. We will do everything to beat Germany,’ said the US coach. Dynamic duo: Joachim Low (left) and Jurgen Kilinsmann (right) worked together between 2004 and 2006 . In the German camp, the party line is much the same. Low’s assistant Hansi Flick reminded reporters that the US had been seconds away from qualification against Portugal, before the Iberians clinched a late equaliser. ‘For that reason, we will do everything to avoid a draw. We want to win.’ Defender Mats Hummels was quick to back his bosses up. ‘It would be horribly unsporting if we were to play for the draw. That’s not how we play. ‘That’s not to say I’m going to be taking on four players on my own in the 91st minute, though,’ Hummels added, ‘though I might take on one or two’. Heartbreak: USA were seconds away from qualifying to the last-16 of the World Cup before Portugal equalised . The German press have certainly made it clear to their team that they will not accept another sporting disgrace against the USA, with Gijon dominating headlines in the build up to Thursday’s game. The ‘Tagesspiegel’ ran with the ominous headline ‘Scandal on the mind’, while ‘Handelsblatt’ simply pleaded ‘Anything but another Gijon’. If the German side needed any other reminder not to repeat the antics of their predecessors, the luck of the draw has also given them a serendipitous heads up. Should Germany win the group as expected, they are likely to play Algeria in the second round. No matter what happens against the USA, the North Africans would surely enjoy a chance to avenge the insult of 1982.","Germany play USA in their final Group G game on Thursday .

"A man's unique charity challenge has become a selfie sensation after he successful spent the month of September taking photos with complete strangers. He has taken selfies with Power Rangers outside Buckingham Palace, posed thousands of feet in the air above France and he even gatecrashed a couples wedding photos in Benidorm. Paul Barnes, 35, from Bolton, Lancashire, has finished his 'Stranger Selfie September' challenge after coming up with the idea to raise money for Cancer Research. He said: 'The best moments along the way were seeing the reactions of a person after you interrupt their day. Paul Barnes, from Bolton, Greater Manchester, said the favourite part of his Stranger Selfie September was interrupting a Spanish wedding (above) 'The initial reaction is a kind of 'what do you want, why are you talking to me, is this a scam, do you want money from me, I don't even know you'. But as soon as they realise all I want is a photo, and the pressure of donation is totally up to them at a later stage, their face changes completely.' His idea to take photos of complete stranger not only helped him meet a whole host of people but it also raised awareness of the charity, as well as having a huge amount of fun. 'My favourite moment was interrupting a Spanish wedding as not only did I manage it, I broke the language barrier,' said Mr Barnes. A selfie with the Power Rangers outside Buckingham Palace, 34-year-old Mr Barnes set himself the task of taking a photograph of himself with someone he doesn't know every day for the entire month . He is trying to start a new fundraising craze with his selfie campaign, in aid of Cancer Research . 'Excuse me, I said, can I have a photo with you please? The groom looked confused, but the bride said 'Ce Ce', then when I got my phone out and got myself into the shot the groom remarked 'Ahhh 'Selfie'. It was such a great moment.' Mr Barnes has his fair few ups and downs during the challenge and admits it was a struggle at times to approach people, with his main regret of missing out on a selfie with former England football star David Platt. He added: 'It takes a lot to go up to a complete stranger, and interrupt their day and then to ask for a photo. Some people just don't want to be bothered and would rather go about their day and some just plain don't like their photo being taken. 'It really knocks the stuffing out of you when you are refused a selfie, but each time it has happened I just think about the reason I am doing this and soldier My mum has had breast cancer and other family members have also been through some very tough times, We have lost close friends and family so this was the reason behind choosing Cancer Research.' Mr Barnes hoped on raising just £200 through the challenge, but ended up with almost £500, which is a figure that is still rising. Mr Barnes is taking a selfie with at least one stranger every single day, or in this case, several during a hen do . A selfie at the beach: Mr Barnes took a selfie with a stranger every single day in September an effort to start a new fundraising craze . 'I did think the idea had potential, but I am a little overwhelmed at just how well it has all gone,' Mr Barnes, following his idea which has inspired others to take part in the challenge for there chosen charity. 'After the first couple of days, I had discussed all kinds of charities with different people. Lucy Openshaw, raising for mental health charity Mind, and Sara Patel, for Papyrus, which help with the prevention of young suicides, both approached me stating that they wished they had thought of the idea. 'It was then that I asked them to set up their own 'Just Giving' page then join the Selfie teams page. This was exactly the reaction I wanted and still hope others will join us and we can all raise money together but for our own causes at the same time. ' Together the group raised around £1000 for their chosen charities as they hope to start a 'chain reaction' of people looking to take up the challenge for a month. Mr Barnes and his team will also be holding a 'super selfie session' to official end their month long challenge at a Tesco Extra in Bolton on Sunday, October 12, taking as many snaps with strangers as possible.

"Should FIFA ban Luis Suarez after latest bite storm? Uruguay striker Luis Suarez has until 9pm tonight to produce any evidence to defend his  extraordinary biting of Giorgio Chiellini during the victory over Italy. But there is nothing in the complex FIFA rulebook preventing Suarez's shocking previous record for biting opponents being taken into account. An expected  six-strong independent FIFA disciplinary committee, chaired by Switzerland's Claudio Sulser, will then decide his fate with the possibility of a decision late tonight. FIFA have to act fast with Uruguay due to play their last sixteen match against Columbia at the Maracana on Saturday. Security: Uruguay's team hotel in Natal has been surrounded by armed guards in response to the incident .

The . disciplinary committee have requested audio and  TV evidence of the . incident with the super high definition coverage likely to make it . glaringly clear that Suarez was guilty of biting - this time on .

FIFA spokeswoman said: 'The processes are outlined in the disciplinary . code, but we cannot anticipate what will happen or a precise timeframe. But they are fully aware of the urgency with Uruguay still in the . competition. 'They are focusing 100 per cent on the proceedings without any involvement from any other body or FIFA figure. Article . 118 states if a ban is for less than three matches or upto two months, . no appeal is allowed  which would rule out the chances of  Suarez  using . the system to  delay his suspension from the tournament.

"Sam Torrance caused one or two raised eyebrows when he urged Europe’s Ryder Cup captain Paul McGinley to end any uncertainty regarding Lee Westwood’s place in the team by picking him straight away. Not least from the man who made Torrance vice-captain. ‘Yeah, I saw that,’ said McGinley, chuckling to himself. ‘That might be Sam’s view but it’s certainly not mine.’ Torrance was on safer ground when he mentioned Graeme McDowell for similar treatment, while Ian Poulter, if necessary, will definitely get one of the three wild cards as well. Big call: Paul McGinley is not afraid to . leave out Lee Westwood for Ryder Cup . But Westwood, whose struggles continued with a missed cut at the Scottish Open, is one of a host of players McGinley will be keeping a close eye on as thoughts turn to the 143rd Open Championship at Royal Liverpool next week. McGinley said: ‘We all know Lee has the pedigree. If you look back at the Ryder Cup since 1997, he has been the one constant pillar of all our success during that time. I’m a huge fan, and I’m certainly not looking to rip up the template. But I have to justify every decision I make, so he has to show me some form. ‘I spoke with Chubby (Chandler, Westwood’s manager) last week and spelled it out. We’ve got three huge events coming up that will determine the final line-up and the truth is Lee needs to do something.’ Poulter and McDowell are in a different category. ‘They’ve got the pedigree and they’re in good form,’ argued the Irishman. Poults is one place outside the team and G-Mac’s just won the French Open. So I’m not going to try to kid anybody. If either of them end up needing a pick, they’ve got a very good chance of getting one.’ It never does any harm to have one or two current major winners in the team and McGinley is confident a European can pull off an Open victory on the Wirral. He said: ‘I’m very interested to see how they get on, because I think our chances of coming up with a winner have gone up considerably with so many of our top guys  competing in the Scottish Open. ‘I could never understand why you would come straight from  Florida to play links golf. Take  tennis. Would Federer or Murray go straight from playing on clay to Wimbledon without a warm-up event on grass? ‘I’m a big fan of seeing a major like a big exam, and you have to  prepare. Going from Florida golf to links golf, to me, is like studying English for a maths exam. So let’s see how they fare at Hoylake.’ Before competing in the Scottish Open, McGinley was at St Andrews last week overseeing a junior camp run by one of his sponsors, Allianz. His passion for the project was obvious. During a clinic he talked about his own career, in which he contributed fully to three Ryder Cup victories. ‘I’ve been a pro for 22 years and I would do things a lot differently if I had my time again,’ he told the audience. Focused: Europe captain McGinley will be keeping a close eye on a host of players . He held up a golf club and likened it to a tree. ‘If you think climbing that tree is like getting to the top in golf, the idea should be to get there as quickly as possible,’ he explained. ‘But there are so many distractions which I regard as branches, like schedule and swing thoughts, and I ended up going sideways along too many branches. ‘I would hold up Colin Montgomerie as the perfect role model in this regard. He didn’t worry about swing changes, or getting too fit. He just concentrated on what would get him to the top.’ McGinley has watched the recent victories for Europe’s heavy hitters with mixed feelings. ‘Don’t get me wrong, it was great to see wins for Martin Kaymer, Rory McIlroy, Justin Rose and G-Mac, and the team is shaping up really nicely,’ he said. ‘But it was like this in 2012, when you couldn’t pick up a paper on a Sunday night without reading about yet another European victory. ‘And what happened when we got to Medinah? We got outplayed for most of the contest and got lucky when Poults changed the outcome almost single-handedly with his performance on Saturday night when he birdied the last  five holes. ‘I’m a great lover of boxing and we were on the ropes in the 11th round when we lashed out and caught our opponent,’ said McGinley. ‘If Poults hadn’t done what he did on the Saturday we’d have probably lost by about four or five points. In the doldrums: Lee Westwood missed the cut at the Scottish Open  in Aberdeen . Good form: England's Ian Poulter will be one of the captain's picks if required . ‘So I’m using that as a real motivating factor. We’ve won the last two Ryder Cups but how many  sessions have we actually won? (The answer is two out of nine). So the American luck has to change. I just hope it’s not on my watch.’Whenever talk turns to The Open right now, McDowell’s name invariably crops up. He was the first-round leader at Hoylake last time and is heading to a course that plays to his strengths with his recent Paris win under his belt. ‘If you look back at G-Mac’s record, he invariably follows one victory with another soon after, and Hoylake looks perfect for him,’ said McGinley. ‘But I’m reluctant to  single out Europeans who I think will do well. Few players react well when they’re under that kind of pressure and I don’t want to heap any on his shoulders.’ Three big events to go and McGinley reckons Victor Dubuisson, Jamie Donaldson, Henrik Stenson, Sergio Garcia, McIlroy and Kaymer are booted and suited. Rose, McDowell and Poulter are all  guaranteed places, one way or the other. So that leaves three places up for grabs. Could the stakes be any higher, therefore, heading to Royal Liverpool? Not only a Claret Jug to play for but a Ryder Cup place as well. One thing’s for sure: McGinley will be watching. l Allianz Insurance ambassador Paul McGinley was mentoring young golfers from across the world at St. Andrews Links.

"A 42-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a police sergeant was shot in the leg with his own gun during a struggle in a  hotel room. The Sergeant, from the Darebin Police Service, was called to a man self harming at the Sleep & Go Bell City on Bell Street in Preston, inner north Melbourne, on Thursday night at around 7.30pm. During a struggle, the officer's gun was fired. 'He received a gunshot wound to the leg,' Leading Senior Constable Adam West said. The officer suffered a gunshot wound to the leg during a 'struggle' with a man who was reportedly self-harming . The incident occurred at the Sleep & Go Bell City on Bell Street in Preston, inner north Melbourne . The officer and the man were taken to hospital for treatment of non-life threatening injuries. An ambulance spokesperson told the Herald Sun that a man with 'lower body injuries' was taken to hospital in a serious but stable condition. The man was brought down from the fourth floor of the three star hotel around an hour after the incident, The Age reports. A woman staying at the hotel, named only as Alex, told the paper she saw dozens of police arrive in the hotel reception when she left the hotel gym. Both the officer and the man were taken to hospital for treatment with non-life threatening injuries . A struggle broke out when officers arrived at the scene . 'The cops were really worried, they were anxious. We heard the words ""attempt to murder"" and ""weapon"",' she said. Police early on Friday said in a statement that a  Preston man had been charged with attempted murder and causing serious injury following a firearms incident. The man has been remanded in custody and will appear in Melbourne Magistrates Court later on Friday.

"Determined: Culture Secretary Sajid Javid, pictured, will dramatically lower the threshold of what is considered a spam call or text . New laws to end the scandal of nuisance marketing calls and text messages plaguing millions of people every day are to be brought in within weeks. Culture Secretary Sajid Javid will dramatically lower the threshold of what is considered a spam call or text and give watchdogs powers to hit the firms behind them with fines of up to £500,000. He says he is determined to act following research showing that so many people are suffering cold calls that 58 per cent say they no longer want to answer their own phone. There has been a particular explosion in nuisance calls offering to recover mis-sold payment protection insurance (PPI) from banks. Spam text messaging is also on the increase, particularly messages about debt management and accident claims. Industry figures show 30million Britons receive up to a billion nuisance phone and text messages a year. But as the law stands, the Information Commissioner’s Office must prove a company caused ‘substantial harm or substantial distress’ by their conduct before it can act. The Government wants to reduce this so the ICO only has to prove the calls have caused ‘annoyance, inconvenience or anxiety’. The ICO can launch an investigation on the basis of a single complaint about a nuisance call or text. In 2012 the watchdog levied a fine of £300,000 against Christopher Niebel, the co-owner of a marketing company, Tetrus Telecoms, which sent hundreds of thousands of texts about PPI and accident claims. Scroll down for video . But last year the Information Rights Tribunal upheld Mr Niebel’s appeal that the messages did not meet the legal test which requires ‘substantial harm or distress’ to have occurred for a fine to be issued. The watchdog warned that the ruling left it almost powerless to deter such companies even if they churn out industrial quantities of messages. Consumers registered with the Telephone Preference Service are not supposed to receive unsolicited marketing calls unless they have agreed to receive them from a specific organisation, but millions do. Surge: Industry figures show 30million Britons receive up to a billion nuisance phone and text messages a year . Mr Javid said he now planned to change the law after a rapid six-week government consultation, to be announced today. The law could be changed within 12 weeks of the end of the consultation. ‘Companies have bombarded people with unwanted marketing calls and texts, but have escaped punishment because they did not cause enough harm,’ he said. ‘Being called day after day may not be “substantially distressing”, but that doesn’t make it acceptable. I want to make it easier for companies to face the consequences of ignoring the law and subjecting us to calls or texts we have said we don’t want.’ Anyone who wants to stop receiving nuisance calls can submit their details to the Telephone Preference Service (TPS). Companies are legally obliged not to make unsolicited marketing calls to numbers listed on the register, and they must screen their data against it. You can request that both your mobile phone and landline numbers are included, and individuals can sign up as well as companies or organisations. Once a number has been submitted, it will be added to the list within 28 days and calls should stop. The TPS is a free service which is funded by the direct marketing industry. Once you have signed up, your phone number will remain active on the register and there is no need to renew your listing. Some 20million phone numbers are currently registered with the TPS – almost four-fifths of households. Richard Lloyd, executive director of consumer group Which? and chair of the Government's taskforce on marketing consent, said: ‘Changing the rules so it's easier for regulators to punish the companies making nuisance calls is a big step forward and a victory for the 125,000 people who supported our campaign on the issue. ‘Millions of us endure unwanted calls and texts every day so these new powers must be introduced as soon as possible. We look forward to the regulators using them to crack down hard on the unscrupulous firms that flout the rules.' Which? is leading a separate review of how consumers provide and withdraw consent to receiving marketing calls, which will report to the Government by the end of December. Information Commissioner Christopher Graham said: 'The public clearly want to see a stop to nuisance calls and texts. 'We welcome this proposed change in the law which will enable the ICO to make more fines stick, sending a clear message to the spammers and scammers that the rules around cold calls and spam texts must be followed. 'The majority of rogue marketing firms make hundreds, rather than thousands, of calls and the nuisance is no less a nuisance for falling short of the ‘substantial’ threshold. 'This change means we could now target those many companies sending unwanted messages – and we think consumers would see a definite drop off in the total number of spam calls and texts.'","Threshold of what is considered a spam call or text will be lowered .

"The public are being urged to cancel planned visits to the Tower of London this weekend to see the magnificent poppy display as the site is becoming too overcrowded. Officials from Historic Royal Palaces, who manage the exhibition, are asking visitors to consider coming the following weekend, when half-term has ended. The Blood Swept Lands and Seas of Red installation will be complete in just 11 days - and has been a phenomenal success attracting around four million visitors from around the world. Scroll down for video . Wide view: A picture taken using a panoramic function offers a majestic view of the site, with the city of London in the background . Crowds: Thousands of people turned out to catch a glimpse of the installation this week - mostly due to the half-term school holidays . Contrast: The Tower of London, first built in the 11th century, is surrounded by a sea of scarlet poppies in the shadow of the Shard - which became Europe's tallest building when it was completed in 2012 . And as the display nears completion and congestion around the site gets worse, Transport for London (TfL) has closed Tower Hill, the nearest Tube station. The closure is likely to cause severe congestion with thousands of people flooding through two Tube stations instead of three. Earlier in the week some visitors described how the poppy memorial was so busy at the beginning of the half-term holiday that there were queues of around one hour just to get in and out of the nearest Tube stations. Others said the area was horribly congested with crowds desperately scrambling to get a look at the sea of flowers. Alert: Historic Royal Palaces, who manage the exhibition, posted this Tweet earlier - urging people to postpone planned weekend visits . Powerful: Paul Cummins's Blood Swept Lands and Seas of Red installation lies before an illuminated Tower Bridge  yesterday . Meticulous: Around 8,000 volunteers have been working on the powerful exhibition at the tower over the last four months . TfL admits 'large numbers of people' are expected over the weekend but claim engineering works were planned before the exhibition was known about. TfL's decision to continue with their planned engineering works has been met with criticism on Twitter with one user calling the move 'crazy'. Ross Lydall wrote: 'Crazy: As thousands head to Tower of London poppy display, Tfl shuts Tower Hill station this w'kend.' A spokesman for Historic Royal Palaces said: 'We are really overwhelmed by the public response and are experiencing huge amounts of visitors. Panoramic: A wider view of the poppies can be seen in this shot. The flowers extend all the way round the Tower of London . Congestion: As the exhibition prepares for one of its busiest weekends, Tower Hill, the nearest Tube station, will be closed for planned engineering works to London's District Line . Visitors: Historic Royal Palaces said it's been overwhelmed by the public response and they are experiencing huge amounts of visitors . On November 12 the same army of 8,000 volunteers who began planting them on July 17 will begin to uproot each bloom individually, before sending it off to be washed and posted on to its new owner . Tour: A Chelsea Pensioner is given the chance to walk through the moat where the poppies have been installed. Each one sold for £25 . 'Our advice to people is that if you want to come and get a really good view of the poppies this weekend, the best time would be before 10am or after 6pm. 'The poppies are floodlit at night and look really beautiful. But we're encouraging as many people as possible to come next weekend when half-term is over.' As a result of the closure of Tower Hill, travelers are being advised to use Tube stations at London Bridge or Aldgate and TfL say their ambassadors will be on duty help with directions. Most of the moat surrounding the Tower of London is now obscured by the exhibition's ceramic poppies - each one marking the death of a Commonwealth soldier during the First World War. Busy: Up to four million people from around the world have now visited the exhibition at the Tower of London . Art: Created by ceramic artist Paul Cummins, with setting by stage designer Tom Piper, the poppies also mark 100 years since the outbreak of the First World War in 1914 . Restricted: The moat is not open during the installation and people are advised to view the poppies from above on Tower Hill . Charity: The project will help support six service charities in the UK including Cobseo, Combat Stress, Coming Home, Help for Heroes, The Royal British Legion and SSAFA . On Remembrance Day, November 11, the last of the 888,246 poppies, each one sold for £25, will be be planted. The very next day, the same army of 8,000 volunteers who began planting them on July 17 will begin to uproot each bloom individually, before sending it off to be washed and posted on to its new owner. The installation, he brainchild of ceramic artist Paul Cummins,  is expected to raise around £11.2million for military charities including Help for Heroes and Combat Stress. Warning: With thousands expected to flock to the site this weekend, Tfl have closed Tower Hill, the nearest Tube Station, for engineering works - visitors are being advised to use Tube stations at London Bridge or Aldgate . Labour of love: Volunteers are busy putting the final touches to the installation while thousands of people watch from the moat path . Sea of scarlet: When the feature is completed on Remembrance Day, November 11, there will be 888,246 ceramic poppies . Military personnel inspect the ceramic poppies as thousands of people crowd the perimeter of Tower Hill on London Poppy Day . Visitor numbers to the Tower have vastly increased since work on the poignant memorial began in July. A Tower of London spokesman today said the attraction is 'extremely busy' and confirmed visitor numbers have increased greatly compared to the same period last year. The scarlet moat also appears to have helped entice visitors into the Tower itself, with reports of queues of up to two hours to see the famous Crown Jewels display. The feature, which has seen potters in Cummins' Derbyshire studio work around the clock making poppies for the piece, was visited by the Queen two weeks ago and by the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge in August. Tribute: Each of the 888,246 poppies planted represents a Commonwealth solider who died during the First World War . Journey: The poignant tribute in the tower's moat has come a long way since work originally started on it back in the summer (above) Each poppy is handmade and carefully shaped by a team of workers in Derby . Each poppy is handmade and individually shaped by a team of local workers in Derby, making each poppy unique. Clay is sliced by hand and rolled into large flat sheets and a metal stamp, much like a large biscuit cutter, carves out petal patterns. They are then paired together by hand to form six overlapping petals. The petals are individually moulded to create the shape of the flower and fired to fix their position. The bright red glaze is applied to the fired poppies before they are returned to the kiln for the second and final firing. Ceramic artist Paul Cummins, who came up with the idea, has had a team working on the project since January. He said: 'I was inspired to create this installation after reading a living will by an unknown soldier who we think may have been from Derby. I approached the Tower as the ideal setting as its strong military links seemed to resonate. 'The installation is transient, I found this poignant and reflective of human life, like those who lost their lives during First World War. I wanted to find a fitting way to remember them'. He came up with the idea of creating a 'sea' of poppies two years and was delighted when the Tower of London decided to bring his idea to life with the help of set designer Tom Piper. The artist has experience of working with historic buildings and over the last three years he has been commissioned to create large-scale installations for the Duke of Devonshire's Chatsworth House, Derby Royal Hospital, Althorp Estate and Blenheim Palace.","Historic Royal Palaces are 'overwhelmed with response' but are encouraging people to come next weekend instead .

"A nationally ranked boxer who hoped to make the 2016 Olympic team has been crushed to death by a six-ton tank he was sandblasting on a job. Tony Losey, a 22-year-old engaged dad of two, was working as a subcontractor at a steel plate company in Wichita, Kansas on Tuesday afternoon when the tank slipped and fell on him. Police Sergeant John Ryan told the Wichita Eagle that although the tanks fall several times a year - often because their weight is not properly supported - people are usually able to get out of the way. 'It doesn't take much once you get that kind of weight moving,' Ryan said. 'Everything shifts out of the way, and it starts sliding.' Tragic: Tony Losey, 22, was crushed to death as he worked as a subcontractor at a steel plate company . Big dreams: Losey had hoped to qualify and try out for the 2016 Olympic boxing team next year . When Losey was found pinned beneath the tank, he was not breathing. Emergency crews arrived on the scene within minutes but he was later pronounced dead. The young dad was well known in boxing circles and was ranked third nationally in the 152-pound weightclass by USA Boxing in July. His coach at Wichita’s Northside Boxing Club, Lewis Hernandez, told KWCH that he was devastated by the loss of Losey, whom he considered to be like a son. 'He's an excellent young man, I mean a great young man. Real... real humble,' said Hernandez, adding that Losey was never too busy to help someone out. Left behind: Losey, who was ranked third in the country for his weight class, was an engaged dad of two . 'He'd go help another kid, you know? See a beginner doing something wrong, he'd go over there and correct them and he'd stick with them, whether it took away from his training time or not.' Speaking to the Eagle, Hernandez added that it was his goal to reach the Olympics. It was his plan to compete at a qualifying trial in January in Washington before hopefully heading to the Olympic Trials in a bid to score a sport on Team USA for 2016. Losey, who was planning his wedding, had turned to boxing to escape the darker areas of his life, Hernandez told the Eagle. His brother was sentenced earlier this month to life in prison for a hit-and-run death of a 34-year-old woman in October last year. Scene: He was sandblasting a tank at Boardman in Wichita, Texas on Tuesday when the accident unfolded . Losey had been in the car at the time of the accident and cops found out he'd violated his probation from a 2011 aggravated battery case by being out past 9pm and by drinking alcohol. As a result, his probation was extended by a year. One of the conditions was that he could only leave home to attend work - but the judge recently allowed him to go to the gym too, after hearing impressive reports of Losey's hard work on the job. 'This is a sad day,' Hernandez added. 'We just have to remember the good times we had with Tony.'","Tony Losey was working as a subcontractor at a steel plate company in Wichita, Kansas on Tuesday when the tank slipped and fell on him .

"Diabetic: Sophia Bhanji was taken to hospital with symptoms of hypoglycemia, or low blood sugar . A diabetic woman died in the back of an ambulance after its lift broke down while outside a hospital - trapping her inside. Sophia Bhanji was taken to Northwick Park Hospital in Harrow, north-west London, in the early hours of Wednesday morning with symptoms of hypoglycemia, or low blood sugar. But when she arrived at the accident and emergency unit, the tail lift of the ambulance she was travelling in stopped working. The fault meant paramedics were unable to move the trolley bed she was being treated on inside the hospital. A number of doctors from the hospital worked for almost an hour in the back of the vehicle to resuscitate Miss Bhanji when she went into cardiac arrest, but they were unable to save her. Miss Bhanji's family are understood not to have been informed of the details surrounding her death before they were contacted by the Evening Standard this morning. A family friend told the newspaper: 'They had their suspicions something was wrong, because she was being treated in the ambulance for a long time. 'Now they know there was a fault with the ambulance and they will want to know how this could have affected the treatment she received. 'The uncertainty will add to their grief as they will want to know if she could have been saved.' Writing on Facebook on Wednesday, her sister Rehanna said: 'Early hours of this morning I lost a part of my heart and life Sophia Bhanji passed away my big sister gone in heaven u r an angel I miss u so much.' Friends quickly responded with heartfelt tributes to Sophia.  One posted: 'Missed Sophie so much today. It's going to be hard.' Another, writing on her other sister Rosemin's profile, said: 'Rest In Peace dear Sophia.' Today the London Ambulance Service was unable to explain why Miss Bhanji was not carried out of the ambulance but said an investigation was under way. A spokeswoman said: 'We can confirm that we were called just after 2.50am on 15 October to reports of a woman feeling unwell at Farm Avenue, Wembley. Fault: The problem with the tail lift on the ambulance, pictured above, meant paramedics were unable to move the trolley bed she was being treated on inside the hospital . 'We sent an ambulance crew to the scene and the patient was taken to Northwick Park Hospital as a priority. 'Our ambulance crew, along with staff from Northwick Park Hospital, made every effort to resuscitate the patient but sadly she died. 'We are aware that there was an issue with the tail lift and we are looking into the circumstances of what happened.' The five-year-old Mercedes Sprinter, normally stationed at the North Kensington ambulance station, has been taken out of service. It is not known whether Miss Bhanji was a Type 1 or Type 2 diabetic.","Sophia Bhanji was taken to Northwick Park Hospital in Harrow, London .

"Adam Freeman, 31, was sentenced to at least five years in jail for his role in the production of more than 19kg of the amphetamine MDA . The son of late Sydney underworld figure George Freeman was brutally bashed in jail with a tuna can by a fellow inmate, a Sydney court heard. The attack on convicted drug manufacturer Adam Freeman with the food container resulted in a 10 centimetre facial laceration, whilst a 'malicious Facebook attack' branded him an 'informer.' Almost four years after Adam Freeman fled overseas in December 2010, he was sentenced on Monday to at least five years for his role in the production of more than 19kg of the amphetamine MDMA. His mother Georgina Freeman gave evidence of the trauma her son has experienced in jail, explaining that her son became a target in the jail within days of his arrival, due to his family connections. Judge Andrew Haesler responded to her claims, telling the court, 'Jails are violent places. Notoriety brings with it risks.' In handing down his judgment at Sydney's District Court, Judge Haesler also described the effect of the Freeman name. Freeman will spend his time in jail 'looking over his shoulder' thanks to his father's notoriety, Judge Haesler said. The 31-year-old entered jail in August. 'He is not to be sentenced as his father's son... but that carries with it certain baggage,' Judge Haesler acknowledged. 'He will serve his sentence ... looking over his shoulder.' By the end of George Freeman's life in 1990, the Kings Cross identity had been accused of assault, fixing horse races, bribing police and running illegal casinos. His reputation as a colourful character of Sydney's late night district was further immortalised in the popular Underbelly television series. When talking about the show in an interview with News Limited in 2009, Adam reportedly praised how his father was portrayed. 'Our dad looked cool, pretty good. ... the others looked stupid because they were drug dealers.' Adam Freeman, son of late Sydney underworld figure George Freeman (pictured), will spend his time in jail 'looking over his shoulder' thanks to his father's notoriety . Speaking outside court his mother Georgina Freeman (pictured) said 'it is always sad when a child takes a wrong turn' But by November 2010, Adam Freeman's views on the drug scene had seemingly changed. The 31-year-old became involved in the large-scale manufacture of drugs at a rural property in Werris Creek near Tamworth in NSW. The venture was brought to a halt after three weeks when his co-accused were arrested during a random breath test. A day later Freeman fled overseas, eventually ending up in Bangkok. After negotiations with the authorities, the 31-year-old was extradited to Sydney in 2011. While it is unclear what role Freeman played in the production of the drugs, Judge Haesler said he was a 'trusted member of the group'. 'His reward I believe would have been commensurate with the risk, which would have been substantial.' Taking into account his early guilty plea and his assistance, Freeman was sentenced to a minimum of five years and a maximum of seven years and eight months. His earliest date of release will be May 2019. Speaking outside court his mother Georgina Freeman said 'it is always sad when a child takes a wrong turn.'

"He was the chairman of the Federal Reserve until the start of this year. But even Ben Bernanke is having trouble refinancing his own home loan. Speaking a conference in Chicago yesterday, the American economist said: 'I recently tried to refinance my mortgage and I was unsuccessful in doing so. When the audience laughed, he added: 'I'm not making that up.' Speaking a conference in Chicago yesterday, Ben Bernanke (pictured) said: 'I recently tried to refinance my mortgage and I was unsuccessful in doing so. When delegates laughed, he added: 'I'm not making that up' Bernanke, 60, made the remarks on lending restrictions to moderator Mark Zandi, of Moody's Analytics Inc, at the National Investment Center for Seniors Housing and Care conference. During the discussion, he addressed the tightening of such restrictions by banks and regulators following the financial meltdown and Great Recession. He said he thought it was 'entirely possible' that lenders 'may have gone a little bit too far on mortgage credit conditions', according to Bloomberg News. He added that the first-time home buyer market is 'not what it should be', with housing the 'one area where regulation has not yet got it right' in a recovering economy. Bernanke, 60, made the remarks on tighter lending restrictions to moderator Mark Zandi, of Moody's Analytics Inc, at the National Investment Center for Seniors Housing and Care conference(file picture) Bernanke, who was paid $199,700 as chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York last year, purchased his three-bedroom Capitol Hill home for $839,000 in 2004, public records show. Since then, he and his wife Anna have refinanced the home twice - with one occasion being in October 2009, when they took out a 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage of $685,385. The other was in September 2011, when they reportedly took out a $672,000, 30-year, fixed-rate loan at 4.25 per cent. Bernanke, who recently joined the Brookings Institution as a distinguished fellow, is currently commanding as much as $250,000 per speech, according to reports seen by CNN. The American economist (pictured delivering his first economic report to Congress in 2006) said he thought it was 'entirely possible' that lenders 'may have gone a little bit too far on mortgage credit conditions' He is also reported to have a $1million book deal. Although is not clear why he has not been able to refinance his home again, one possibility could be that that his new, irregular income is more difficult to verify that his previous salary. It is also possible that his recent change of jobs has made him a steeper credit risk in the automated world of mortgage finance.","Ben Bernanke, 60, said he failed in attempt to refinance his home loan .

"Reocvery: Kian Musgrove is showing no signs of the neoblastoma he was diagnosed with last year . When the results of 18-month-old Kian Musgrove's full body scan came through, doctors feared the worst for the youngster. The image, taken at Newcastle's Royal Victoria Infirmary, was covered in 27 black spots on his legs, lymph nodes, spine and skull. Each one was a tumour. But after 10 weeks of gruelling chemotherapy and a number of surgeries, the cancer appears to have gone. His relieved mum Kat, 26, who lives in Newcastle, said: ‘Kian has been absolutely amazing. He has fought through this incredibly well. ‘When the doctors said they couldn’t see any of the tumours anymore, it was such a relief. To think that he has fought off 27 tumours is just incredible.’ Kian first started being unwell last summer whilst on a family holiday to Turkey with his mum and sister Katie, four. Miss Musgrove said: ‘He woke up one morning whilst we were on holiday and he just couldn’t seem to get his balance. The following day he had a high temperature and I thought he had picked up a virus so I took him to the doctors there. ‘They said he was just teething and we were due to fly home later that day so we got on the plane and came home. When we arrived home he was screaming so much in pain and it wasn’t like him so I took him straight to hospital.’ When he got to hospital doctors x-rayed him to see if he had broken any bones, which he hadn’t, so he was sent home again. But he carried on getting worse. Miss Musgrove took him back to the doctors another six times, and each time he was sent home after she was told it was just a virus. She said: ‘I knew there was something wrong with Kian, but each time the doctors sent him home insisting it was just a virus.’ After Kian still wasn’t any better after eight weeks, Miss Musgrove took him to the Royal Victoria Infirmary where they took blood tests. She said: ‘I was at my wits end by then. Kian was just lifeless in my arms and whimpering. They had a terrible time trying to get blood out of him as his blood was just clotthing immediately. Initially they thought he had a bone infection, so they kept him in.’ But then tests revealed that he had cancerous cells in his body. They broke the devastating news to Miss Musgrove that Kian actually had cancer. Covered: The scan revealed he had 27 tumours, the only parts of his body not affected were his hands and feet . Relieved: His mother Kat, 26, took him to the doctors six times. On each occasion they said he had a virus . Hospital: Kian went through 10 weeks of treatments including radiotherapy and a number of surgeries . She said: ‘My world just fell apart when they told me had cancer. It was the biggest shock of my life. I just couldn’t take it in. ‘All those times when I’d taken him to the doctors and they’d said it was just a virus. When all along he’d been fighting cancer.’ A scan revealed the terrible extent of his disease. Tumours were raging all around his body. Miss Musgrove said: ‘I nearly fainted when I saw his full body scan photos. It was just a mass of black everywhere. It was in his bones all over his body. The only place where there were no tumours were his hands and feet.’ Kian started chemotherapy straight away. He had ten weeks of intensive treatment then he had operations to remove a tumour in his adrenal gland and one on his lymph nodes. Then he had his own stem cells removed, followed by high dose chemotherapy treatment again. Then he had a stem cell transplant. Now after his massive battle, there are no sign of the 27 tumours. He is still having radiotherapy treatment as neuroblastoma cancer in children can recur. Kat said: ‘We can’t believe he has done so well. There is a possibility of the cancer coming back so we are fundraising to take him to America for treatment that isn’t available over here. ‘He has done so well so far, and we want to give him every possible chance in the future which is why we are fundraising to take him to America.' Family: Kian, pictured with his four-year-old sister Katie, developed the symptons last August while on holiday . Neuroblastoma is a rare childhood cancer which develops from nerve cells called neuroblasts. It usually starts in the child's abdomen, often developing in the adrenal glands above the kidneys. It can then spread to other areas such as the bones, liver and skin. The cancer affects about 100 children in the UK each year and is usually diagnosed in under-5s. It is the most common form of solid tumour cancer in childhood after brain tumours. The symptoms depend on where the cancer is and whether it has spread. Initial symptoms often include aches and pains and loss of appetite. The most common symptom when the cancer has developed is a lump or swelling in the child's abdomen. Other possible symptoms are a lump in the child's neck, bone pain, weakness in the child's lower body, anaemia and bluish lumps in the skin. Because the early symptoms are vague, the cancer is often not diagnosed until it has spread around the body. The outlook is better if the child is younger and the cancer is slower growing. It is common for the cancer to return after treatment and treatment tends to be less successful in older children.

"America’s Walt Disney is poised to take full control of the ailing French firm that runs Disneyland Paris. After decades of financial losses, Euro Disney yesterday said it required an £800million rescue package to keep the park open. Despite attracting millions of visitors a year and owning the rights to all of the popular Disney characters, the French-operated theme park has never made a profit since launching in 1992. Scroll down for video . Sleeping Beauty Castle: Despite attracting millions of visitors a year and owning the rights to all of the popular Disney characters, the French-operated theme park has never made a profit since launching in 1992 . Yesterday the park said business has deteriorated ever further, as it went begging to its investors for more money. Some 14.1million visitors flocked through its gates last year – almost 800,000 fewer than the year before. The theme park has suffered as cash-strapped families in France and across Europe reined in their spending in the wake of the financial crisis. As many as five of its top seven markets were plunged into recession in 2013. Before the financial crash hit, it was enjoying attendance numbers of more than 15million. Its range of Disney hotels at the park – which are undercut by local, cheaper rivals – have also seen their takings dwindle. Europe's biggest tourist destination now expects to report financial losses of £94million this year, up from £61million last year. The company yesterday said it required £800million to pay down its burgeoning debt mountain. Floats: The park said business has deteriorated ever further, as it went begging to its investors for more money . Euro Disney shares on the Paris stock exchange plunged more than 20 per cent on the news. Walt Disney, which owns 40 per cent of Euro Disney, has agreed to stump up the money. But other investors have not yet committed. Mark Stead, Euro Disney finance director, said: ‘It is clear that if none of the other shareholders participate, Walt Disney will increase its holding.’ Ten per cent of the company is owned by the Saudi prince AlWaleed bin Talal. Euro Disney said cutting its mountain of debt would leave it with more cash to improve and invest in new facilities, which could include new rides to ‘enhance the guest experience’. In July this year, the theme park opened its 60th ride based on the Disney Pixar film Ratatouille about a chef rat. The ride uses a 3D projection system to take guests through the film’s bustling kitchens. The admission of failure by the Parisian firm comes after France received a barrage of criticism over its economic malaise in recent days. Last week the boss of John Lewis said that France was ‘finished’. Fireworks: Before the financial crash hit, the park was enjoying attendance numbers of more than 15million . Andy Street described the French nation as ‘sclerotic, hopeless and downbeat,’ adding: ‘I have never been to a country more ill at ease… nothing works and worse, nobody cares about it.’ In a London speech he was later forced to apologise for, he also described Paris’ flagship train station Gare du Nord as the ‘squalor pit of Europe’. One of Germany’s most highly regarded economists also warned that France could ‘bring down’ the euro by refusing to get to grips with austerity. Hans-Werner Sinn, the president of Germany’s Institute for Economic Research think tank, accused the bloated socialist state of ‘hiding the unemployed in government offices’.

"Marussia sporting director Graeme Lowdon has revealed the confusion and mayhem that followed Kimi Raikkonen's accident on the opening lap of Sunday's British Grand Prix helped wreck Max Chilton's race. Chilton admitted he was ""very lucky"" as a stray tyre from the 150mph, 47g impact of Raikkonen's Ferrari into a metal guardrail flew over his head after hitting the front-left wing of his car. Believing his race to be over as he was unsure of the damage, Chilton returned to the pits when he instead should have lined up on the grid as the race had been red flagged. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Incredible new angles of Raikkonen British F1 Grand Prix crash . Crash: Raikkonen's car is lifted away from the track after his 150mph smash at Silverstone . Once the race resumed behind the safety car after an hour's delay to carry out repairs to the barrier, Chilton was immediately a lap down. The 23-year-old had to wait at the end of the pit lane whilst the field toured behind the safety car for a lap, only being released once they had filed past. As further punishment for entering the pit lane under a red flag, Chilton was handed a stop-go penalty, eventually finishing the race in 16th and two laps down on race winner Lewis Hamilton. Explaining Chilton's difficulties, Lowdon said: 'Max unfortunately got caught up in that accident where Kimi went off. Blunder: Chilton went in to the pits while the red car was out, incurring a stop-go penalty . 'The car sustained some damage, and although it was only to the front nose, it was unclear at the time, so he called to pit, but then obviously the race was suspended. 'When the red flags come out you cannot then enter the pits, but by that stage it was too late as he'd already committed to coming in, so he was then stuck between a rock and a hard place. 'It was a bit a double whammy as he had to start at the end of the pit lane, and on the resumption of the race behind a safety car which does a lap, you are a lap down. 'You only start when the last car goes past the end of the pit lane and the pit lane exit lights go green. 'Then, of course, he received a penalty because it's very clear in the sporting regulations you can't pit when a race is suspended. Battling back: The young Brit eventually finished 16th despite losing time . 'It was unfortunate the way the timing all worked.' Lowdon concedes the volume of radio traffic further clouded matters, adding: 'There were a lot of things going back and forth. 'First of all there was the shock of the accident, and secondly he was trying to feel the extent of the damage to the car, and then the red was thrown in the middle of that. 'Potentially it could have been a really nasty accident for Max because there were some bits flying around, and he just appeared at the wrong time and the wrong place. It was one of those things.'","Max Chilton finished 16th at British Grand Prix .

"I thought we had seen everything in this World Cup, but that first half was absolutely unbelievable. I wrote on Monday that I feared for Brazil. Yes, they have talent but they have been playing off the cuff and relying on pure passion to get them through. And it finally caught up with them.

"Thousands of strays, of both the homeless canine and working feline variety, were rounded up and cleared off the streets of Rio as part of the pre-World Cup clean up. There must have been at least a couple of four-legged survivors. Because England have made two dog’s dinners of Brazil 2014. One on the pitch, the other off it. Dog's dinner: Roy Hodgson guided England to an early exit after losing their opening two games . To end up playing a match which was surplus to little Costa Rica’s requirements – but a dead-dog rubber for England - before slinking back home is more humiliating than it has ever been for football’s mother country. To inflict a goalless draw of such numbing indifference on so brilliant a World Cup carnival was tantamount to an act of vandalism. But not as wretched as to indulge in self-aggrandising, show-boat insulting of FIFA and its president in public, which was not only embarrassing but moronic. Whatever Roy Hodgson and his team got wrong in what turned out to be not so much a group of slow death as one of rapid suicide, those deficiencies pale in comparison with the damage self-inflicted on our national game by chairman Greg Dyke and his FA gang of fools. There are times when Hodgson is too open and honest for his own good – although bless him for that – but when it comes to putting boot in mouth Dyke is in a class all his own. Debacle: England are heading home early from the World Cup after losing to Italy and Uruguay . Hodgson is endlessly courteous and charming when trying to explain the thinking behind decisions for which he is criticised. It probably wasn’t a great idea to declare, after the debacle in Brazil, that he will need six more years to get England up to World Cup speed. Even US presidents only ask for four more. But he is telling it as he sees it, not for effect nor to excuse in advance what may well go wrong in the next couple of tournaments. England’s manager is simply trying to focus the FA and the Premier League on the scale of the task and the revolution which needs to take place. Since World Cups are voyages of discovery, Hodgson is speaking from what he has learned here. It was a mistake to bring too many young players. Albeit one made in the desperate knowledge that the long-established members of the squad had failed too often, losing the faith of the English public while doing so. Mistakes: Hodgson will have to go back to the drawing board ahead of the European Championship qualifiers . Two or three boys of exceptional promise – Raheem Sterling, Ross Barkley, Daniel Sturridge – were enough. Tactically there was an old-fashioned look about England. The world game evolves constantly and we saw little or nothing from Roy’s Boys of the dynamic pressing and quick, clever angled passing made possible by sharp movement which are fundamental to the best teams in this competition. That is by no means all the fault of this manager. The Premier League is more about box-office thrills and spills than technique and intelligence, while not enough English players are benefitting from the experience of the Champions League. Even so Hodgson will shoulder his share of the blame for a showing even more dismal than England’s only previous failure to qualify from the group stage. Promising signs: Ross Barkley was one a few England players to make an impression . So must the likes of Steven Gerrard, Wayne Rooney, Leighton Baines, Phil Jagielka, Joe Hart, Jordan Henderson and Danny Welbeck. At least in 1958 England forced three draws and returned home undefeated. Two strikes and out before this mostly meaningless exercise in Belo Horizonte of giving the back- up chaps consolation World Cup caps is nothing less than humiliation. Frankly, it is no wonder that the folks back home wonder how some of these players can be paid so much yet do so little for the country. The wretchedness of their efforts has become clearer with a realisation that Italy and Uruguay are no better than average teams. Shouldering the blame: The likes of Rooney, Baines and Jagielka must take responsibility . Yes, part of the answer lies in improving the identifying of the best young talent and educating those boys properly in the finer arts of football. This is the primary responsibility of the FA. Dyke pays lip service to that duty, while just grandstanding on the world stage. England were like a dog chasings its own tail. Even worse, the FA were barking up all the wrong trees. Dyke should have been campaigning for the introduction of international regulations which would force the self-interested Premier League to limit the number of foreigners at our major clubs and thereby develop world class footballers of English birth-right. He should have been working quietly behind the scenes to heal the rift between England and the governing body of the world game so that we might rebuild the respect and influence we once had and, hopefully, bring football home again. Dog's dinner: Greg Dyke's tenure has been nothing sure of a disaster so far . But oh no. Not our Mr Dyke. Up he jumped in front of the whole congress to demand the head of Sepp Blatter over a corruption issue for which he is not culpable - and even as he is presiding over a magical World Cup which will generate billions for the game around the world. There is as much chance of Blatter not being re-elected next year as there ever was of England winning this World Cup. It’s all in the timing. This is embarrassingly reminiscent of previous FA bigwigs promising to vote for a European candidate against Blatter when he was first elected, then hastily switching when they realised which way the wind was blowing. Dyke fancied he could position himself as the champion of an anti-Blatter movement. Seemingly he fails to understand that it was this president who expelled Mohammad Bin Hamman, the Qatari accused of 2022 World Cup hosting corruption. Attack: Dyke hit out at Sepp Blatter on the eve of the tournament . Nor does he grasp that any hostility to Blatter in most of the rest of the world is nothing like as fierce as in insular England and that he has antagonised not only the FIFA high command but  many other countries. If it really is English football’s ambition never to win or stage the World Cup again, then the FA have gone a long way towards achieving those goals.","England humiliated by early exit at the World Cup .

"Moeen Ali had to wait a long time before his sceptical captain gave him a proper bowl on Sunday. But in wrestling back a Test that had been slipping from England’s grasp, he soon showed he might become more than just a bit-part spinner. Alastair Cook has made it clear with his sparing use of Moeen in this two-Test Investec series that he remains far from convinced the Worcestershire all-rounder is the man capable of stepping into Graeme Swann’s massive shoes. It seemed almost in desperation that the England captain finally threw him the ball with just over an hour of the third day to go. He had given Moeen just one over before then in Sri Lanka’s second innings on this dry Headingley pitch. A Test that England had dominated for most of the first two days was slowly being turned on its head by the Sri Lankan giants Kumar Sangakkara and Mahela Jayawardene, and Cook’s need of a breakthrough was becoming acute. VIDEO Ali pleased with late breakthrough against Sri Lanka . Breakthroughs: Moeen Ali claimed two wickets in two balls when Sri Lanka were cruising at Headingley . Big wicket: Matt Prior celebrates as Sri Lanka's Kumar Sangakkara was given out LBW off Moeen's bowling . Key wickets: Moeen looks determined after taking the wicket of Sangakkara for 55 runs . Short stuff: Diminutive but hugely experienced, Mahela Jayawardene withstood some aggressive bowling . Hal a job: Jayawardene acknowledges his 50 milestone but will be key to Sri Lanka setting a big total . Enter the man the New Road marketing . men call the ‘beard that’s feared’. Sangakkara, who had just become only . the fourth man to record seven consecutive Test scores of 50 or more, . was in the mood to turn what might be his last Test innings in England . into something considerably more substantial. Yet . Moeen, who had dismissed Sangakkara for his first Test wicket at . Lord’s, quickly made him his  second victim when one of the greatest of . all batsmen played him the old-fashioned way with his pad rather than . bat, and was lbw. Cook could . easily have then taken Moeen off to attack Lahiru  Thirimanne with . either of the men who have tormented him in this series — Jimmy Anderson . and Liam Plunkett — but he kept his spinner on and was immediately . rewarded. Thirimanne was . dismissed for two and two at Lord’s and was out first ball in the first . innings here.  Perhaps ominously, with Rangana Herath due to bowl last, . Moeen got appreciable turn and Thirimanne was bowled by a beauty to . complete his pair. It was . two wickets in three balls for Moeen, and how England needed that double . strike. When they had battled their way to 311 for three on Saturday . thanks to Sam Robson’s maiden hundred in reply to Sri Lanka’s 257, there . seemed only one possible winner of this decisive Test. VIDEO Sangakkara is the world's best batsmen - Atapattu . Another milestone: Sangakkara earlier reached a record-equalling seventh consecutive half-century . Danger man: The veteran left-hander added 55 runs to his 79 in the first innings . Yet . the dismissal of Ian Bell, frustratingly strangled down the leg-side, . was the catalyst for a transformation that saw Sri Lanka take England’s . last seven wickets for 54 runs and then fight their way to 214 for four . by Sunday’s close. Thanks . to Moeen, England remain favourites but if Sri Lanka can extend a lead . that currently stands at 106 beyond 200, then a team without a Test win . since their third in the Ashes last summer at  Durham will be decidedly . twitchy. This was . undoubtedly Sri Lanka’s day from the moment their impressive captain . Angelo Mathews showed his seamers how to do it by putting the ball in . the right place at barely 75 miles per hour and letting the conditions . do the rest. Mathews, little . more than an occasional bowler, had struck twice on Saturday and took . two of the last four England wickets to fall, with the notoriously . fickle Headingley pitch suddenly resembling a minefield. Stranded: Prior managed just 27 not out before he ran out of partners as England lost four wickets for 45 runs . House knocked over: Liam Plunkett walks off after his middle stump was displaced by Angelo Mathews . Opening up the shoulders: With wickets falling around him Matt Prior hit Shaminda Eranda for six . When . England’s last two men in Plunkett and Anderson fell to near-unplayable . balls, Cook (below) would have been confident that a lead of 108 would . prove decisive. But his seamers got it all wrong and Sri Lanka displayed . considerable spirit. England . clearly expected uneven bounce but little came when they kept on . bowling a fraction too short. They did not help themselves with yet . another fielding lapse, Chris Jordan dropping Dimuth Karunaratne when he . was on four. A wicket then . would have exposed  Sangakkara to the new ball and things could have . been very different. But Anderson and Stuart Broad, worryingly with five . Tests to come against India in just six weeks, struggled to make an . impression and looked out on their feet by the close. It . was left to Plunkett, seizing his second chance in Test cricket, to . take the first two wickets but with Sangakkara and  Jayawardene both . reaching their half-centuries Cook was running out of ideas before he . turned to his spinner. Floored: Chris Jordan drops a catch off the edge of Sri Lanka's Dimuth Karunaratne at second slip . Out of character: The athletic fast bowler put down a straightforward catch off James Anderson's bowling . No idea: Anderson cops a brilliant bouncer from Eranga which he can only glove to the bowler . ‘It . was nice to contribute and get us back in the game,’ said Moeen, who . even bowled his doosra in the seventh of his nine overs. ‘They were . playing very well at the time and I just tried to bowl as straight as I . can to Sanga because if you get it slightly wrong he can take you . apart.’ England still have . much to do and Jayawardene, almost certainly playing in his last Test in . England, is still there after surviving a reviewed lbw call from . Plunkett on 45 that just about went in his favour. Together . with Mathews he could yet push Sri Lanka’s lead beyond the 225 which . they think, with  Herath in their ranks and the pitch expected to offer . more turn on the last two days, will win them their first Test series in . England. It is up to . England, who squandered seven chances in Sri Lanka’s first innings . before throwing away their position of dominance with the bat, to make . sure they make no further mistakes.","England were all out for 365 on morning of day three at Headingley .

"As the four remaining teams in this year’s World Cup prepare for battle with a place in the final at stake, there is one war that has already been won... by adidas. More than half of the players expected to start in the semi-finals will be wearing boots made by the German sportswear giant. Those adidas players include Lionel Messi, Arjen Robben, Thomas Muller and Oscar. Adidas and their 26 players lead rivals Nike, who have 15 sporting the famous swoosh, while only two players will walk out in Puma boots at the semi-final stage. And one, Brazil's Hulk, wearing Mizuno. VIDEO Scroll down for Lionel Messi and more... plus an ENTIRE breakdown of all the boots!

Adidas’ Battle Pack range seem to be the most popular among the world’s elite. Mesut Ozil, Robben and Robin van Persie will all take to the field in adidas’ new World Cup range. Messi even has his own design - the F50 Adizero Messi. Wearing the same boots as the four-time Ballon D’or doesn’t come cheap, though, at the cost of £170. Brazil’s quarter-final hero David Luiz leads the way for Nike along with team-mates Willian and Luis Gustavo. The centre-half, whose boot took the hosts to the last four with a spectacular 30-yard free-kick, will be lacing up his Nike Magista Obras once again in Tuesday's clash with Germany in Belo Horizonte. Nike’s newest boot, developed especially for the World Cup, has a sock-like second skin to improve durability and provide an almost barefoot feel. Emulating the former Chelsea man’s choice of footwear will set you back £255, though. Eight of Germany’s expected starting line-up will be wearing adidas, including Manuel Neuer, Philipp Lahm, Mats Hummels, Toni Kroos and Bastian Schweinsteiger. In the other semi-final, six of the eleven players for Argentina will be wearing adidas boots. Amid the players wearing adidas is . acrobatic goalkeeper Romero, energetic winger Lavezzi and, of course, . arguably one of the finest players to have ever graced the game, Messi. Four of the 11 players for the South American giants will be wearing . Nike, including world-class full-back Pablo Zabaleta and midfield . maestro Javier Mascherano. Puma icon Sergio Aguero will be wearing the . rather vibrant EvoSpeed boots which have unsurprisingly caught the eye of many . football fans. Flick: Mesut Ozil will take to the pitch with his Germany team-mates wearing his adidas boots . Crunch time: Ozil will line up with Germany to take on the host nation Brazil on Tuesday . The two super-brands have been going head-to-head for nearly 60 years, and are the equivalent of Argentina vs Brazil. Cristiano Ronaldo and Gareth Bale may be team-mates at Real Madrid but they are enemies in terms of branding. Ronaldo being with Nike, and Bale with adidas.

Battle Pack Range. This connotes that the new range of adidas boots is . more successful than the new Nike Magista’s, both of which were . previously unveiled before the World Cup commenced. The boot encounter concerning the . Holland squad conveys a very comparable story. Although this time it is . even more disproportionate as eight of the expected . starting eleven will be wearing adidas boots on the fateful night. This . includes the likes of the outstanding Robben and the magnificent Van Persie both having used their flamboyant footwear to help . their team progress. The two stars both wear the adidas f50 AdiZero . boots - part of the Battle Pack range. Just three of the Holland expected . line-up will be wearing Nike, which is a very disappointing statistic for the . company. Wesley Sneijder will be showing off his Nike Hypervenom’s as . well as Ron Vlaar and Stefan de Vrij, who will be wearing their Nike Tiempo’s, . but adidas is sure to gain more publicity with eight out of the 11 . players wearing their boots.

"The New York City clinic where Joan Rivers was having surgery when she went into cardiac arrest could lose its license in January. Yorkville Endoscopy, located in the city's Upper East Side neighborhood, was deemed deficient in four major categories required for accreditation following an investigation by the New York State Health Department. If it does not correct these problems, it will lose its license on January 7 of next year. Scroll down for video . Deficient: The clinic where Joan Rivers went into cardiac arrest while undergoing routine surgery has been deemed 'deficient' by the New York State Health Department . Shut down: Yorkville Endoscopy (above) has until January to fix their problems or they will lose their license. Dr. Lawrence Cohen, who was director of the clinic and Joan's gastroenterologist was forced to step down . In a October 9 letter to the clinic's director of operations, Tricia Dougherty, btained by MailOnline, the categories the clinic is 'noncompliant in the following four areas:  'governing body and management, surgical services, medical staff and patient rights.' 'This is a big, big deal,' Dr. Jerome Waye, a Manhattan gastroenterologist who has spoken with physicians on the Yorkville staff about the investigation, told MailOnline. 'They won't be able to take Medicare patients, and that's got to be at least half their clientele.' 'I don't know of any circumstance where the whole Medicare certification is pulled over one doctor doing one procedure,' said Waye. 'I'm quite surprised that Medicare has come down on Yorkville like this,' Waye said. Waye said it appeared as though the violations were directly related to the Rivers incident. Dr Wayne believes that the violation of patient's rights cited alludes toThe patient's letting someone not certified do the biopsy, violating [Rivers'] rights and and the 'governing body and management' I for them not following protocol in letting the doctor do the unauthorized procedure, . After reading the letter, Dr.Wayne believes that that 'they didn't do much of an investigation, if they didn't find any wrongdoing by the doctors. It looks like they just threw everything they could at [Yorkville], saying you had all these violations, now we're going to take away your certification.' Other specifics are not being disclosed at this time. Furthermore, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Service notified the clinic that it 'no longer meets the requirements for participation as a supplier of services in the Medicare program.' A source close to the investigation confirmed to the MailOnline that Yorkville did, indeed, respond to the Oct. 9th letter with a Plan of Correction within the ten days required by Medicare. The source also confirmed that the investigation resulted from a complaint over the Rivers' incident. This news comes just one day after it was revealed that Rivers died due to a lack of oxygen in her blood. The popular comedian was having routine surgery at Yorkville Endoscopy on August 28. Her gastroenterologist, Dr. Lawrence Cohen, who was in charge of the procedure, has since left the practice.

"Southampton have begun their rebuild under new manager Ronald Koeman by completing the signing of Dusan Tadic in a deal that could be worth up to £10.3million. The Saints saw off reported late interest from Everton to complete the deal for the Serbian midfielder. Tadic, 25, moves to St Mary’s from Dutch club FC Twente and his arrival at St Mary’s on a four-year contract is a huge boost to the south coast club following recent departures of Adam Lallana, Rickie Lambert and Luke Shaw, and strong interest from Liverpool in central defender Dejan Lovren. Scroll down for video . Incoming: Southampton have completed the £10.3m signing of Dusan Tadic from Twente . Tadic said: 'It is a really nice feeling, this is a really nice club of which I have heard a lot of good things about. I have already seen the beautiful training centre and there are lots of nice people that work here including the coaches, so I am really happy to be here.' Attacking midfielder Tadic, 25, scored some 16 times in 33 league games last season for Twente, as the Dutch side finished third behind Ajax and Feyenoord. Tadic is confident he has joined a club going places under Koeman, who impressed while in charge of Feyenoord in the Eredivisie. 'I watched a lot of the games last season and saw that the club plays really nice football which will suit me because I like to play in the same way,' he added. 'The manager obviously knows me from the Dutch league so when he called me and told me his plan it was an easy decision to make. 'I know the manager well because he is one of the biggest Dutch legends in football, everyone knows him. 'He is a really good coach and you can always expect his teams to play well because he is leading them and because he is so good tactically. I am really excited to start playing for the club.' VIDEO Tadic becomes Koeman's first signing . International star: Tadic (left) has been a regular for the Serbia national side since 2008 . Koeman made Tadic one of his leading targets shortly after succeeding Mauricio Pochettino as Saints manager. He will be a natural replacement for left-sided Lallana who joined Liverpool in a £25million deal shortly after England’s exit from the World Cup. Tadic has played in Holland since 2010 after starting his  career in his native Serbia. He played for Groningen before signing for Twente, who finished third in the Dutch league and Tadic’s reputation soared as a player who can create as well as score goals.","Dusan Tadic has signed four-year deal with Saints after late Everton interest .

"Centre Court was dressed up for the coronation of Eugenie Bouchard. Genie’s Army whooped as the starlet entered stage left clasping a bouquet of flowers, smiling warmly at her adoring fans. Even Buckingham Palace played their part, dispatching Princess Eugenie, the Canadian starlet’s namesake, to sit just feet behind the baseline in the front row of the Royal Box. The unwilling participant in this production was Petra Kvitova, who destroyed a helpless Bouchard in a 55-minute exhibition of terrifyingly good tennis . It was the shortest women’s final since 1983 when another Czech, Martina Navratilova, took 54  minutes to beat Andrea Jaeger, an American who has since become a nun. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Eugenie Bouchard dazzle during Sportsmail photo shoot . Victorious: Petra Kvitova is the 2014 women's Wimbledon champion after beating Eugenie Bouchard 6-3, 6-0 . Debate: The female winners get the same prize money as the males, but play less time . All eyes on her: Champion Kvitova beat Bouchard in 55 minutes on Centre Court . The moment: Kvitova drops her racket after hitting a superb winner on championship point at SW19 . Brave: Bouchard was runner-up but lasted just 55 minutes in the Wimbledon women's final . Respect: The pair shake hands on Centre Court after the match which ended 6-3, 6-0 to Kvitova (right) Off her feet: Kvitova's match was just four minutes longer than Novak Djokovic and Roger Federer's first set . Bouchard is unlikely to retire to the . convent just yet, stating afterwards: ‘I will never be satisfied, I want . to play in many more Grand Slam finals.’ But . she was no match for Kvitova, who was imperious in winning her second . Wimbledon title. The world No 6 greeted victory by shutting her eyes . momentarily, raising both arms towards her player’s box and laying flat . on the lawn. Kvitova’s . ascent to the box to celebrate with her team was as straightforward as . her victory, facilitated by the introduction of a ‘safety gate’, which . has removed the iconic scramble over the commentary box and into the . stands. The emotion of the moment was not diminished for Kvitova or her . father Jiri who was in floods of tears as he was when she beat Maria . Sharapova to win her only other Grand Slam title here in 2011. ‘He . cries a lot actually,’ said Kvitova. ‘It’s nothing new, nothing . special. Actually I think everyone was crying in my box, he wasn’t only . one. I was crying, as well. I get that from my dad. ‘He has a birthday tomorrow, so I’m just glad that he has a nice present.’ Unfortunate: Eugenie Bouchard had no answers to Petra Kvitova on Centre Court in two sets . Happy moment: Kvitova made it up into the stands to celebrate with a member of her support . Focused: Kvitova was desperate to land her second Wimbledon title . Easy: Kvitova won the first set 6-3 on Centre Court on Saturday, with the roof open . When . she woke on Saturday morning, the 24-year-old was greeted by the word . ‘bojd’ - a Czech term meaning ‘come on' - which her coach David Kotyza . spelled out in kitchen roll on the front garden of the house she is . staying at in Wimbledon. The . pair remained a professional partnership even as Kvitova struggled to . recapture the promise she showed three years ago. His charge did not . require much encouragement yesterday. She . broke Bouchard’s serve six times and won seven consecutive games to . triumph 6-3, 6-0. Using her backhand as a tranquiliser dart and her . forehand to deliver the fatal blow, Kvitova zapped the belief of the . talented 20-year-old. Even . Kvitova’s movement, normally considered the weak point of her game, was . superb as she chased down balls even she didn’t expect to reach. ‘I . think maybe it was magic,’ said Kvitova. ‘A few shots were really . incredible and I couldn’t believe I was getting there and then playing . such an amazing shot back. I said to myself “Oh my God this is good. I . can really run and get everything back.” ‘This . means maybe more than 2011 because I really played a great tournament . here. I was ready for every match and I think that I’m more prepared to . handle the pressure.’ Pressure: 20-year-old Bouchard was playing in her first ever Grand Slam final . Hitting winners: Kvitova was far too strong for the youngster in the first set . Potential: This may not have been Bouchard's year, but many are tipping her to win a Grand Slam soon . Dominant: The Czech star celebrates after winning a point in the first set . The . majority of the attention before the match had been focused on Bouchard, . earmarked as ‘the next Maria Sharapova’ and who could potentially rival . the Russian in both major titles and off-court earnings. She did not suffer a fit of nerves and even broke Kvitova once in the first set but she admitted to being outplayed. ‘I . think it’s a tough road to try to become as good as I want to be,’ she . said, ‘I’m not going to win every single time. I think this was a good . experience for me, my first Slam final. ‘It . was a big moment walking out onto Centre Court for a final. You know, I . have that experience now. I know what it feels like. It was very . special. It was different. We were holding flowers instead of our . tennis bags. I just felt so grateful to be able to walk out on a stage . and, you know, have a chance to perform and do what I love. It was nice . to have Princess Eugenie there, I’m just sorry I couldn’t have put on a . better show for her.’ The . rain began to fall over SW19 just as the final point was concluded. The . roof was shut on Centre Court and the players were led into the bowels . of the building as the lawn was prepared for the trophy presentation. Bouchard, who won junior Wimbledon just two years ago, was led to the . engraver’s room. Celebrity presence: British actor Chiwetel Ejiofor sits beside Keira Knightley (right) on Centre Court . Looking smart: Frank Lampard in Christine Bleakley sit in the Royal Box . Support: Eugenie Bouchard was watched by her namesake, Princess Eugenie (pictured), at Wimbledon today . ‘I was watching them work, wishing one day, dreaming that he’ll write my name somewhere,’ she said. ‘Maybe . it’s a bit cruel but I didn’t ask questions. I was in there when I won . the juniors. So I had flashbacks to that time. At that time I also got a . picture with the men’s doubles winners which included the British man . Jonny Marray. I think it’s fascinating. ‘There are some old pictures on the wall. You see these trophies. It’s like nothing else.’ Bouchard, . who will go into the top 10 in the world for the first time next week, . will take home £880,000 in prize money and stands to earn much more in . endorsement deals. But presently her mind is on her living room in . Montreal. ‘I’m just excited to spend a little time off, you know, with my family back home. ‘I’m . going to spend a lot of time on my couch.

"Jenson Button will go into the British Grand Prix with his future as uncertain as at any time in his distinguished 15-year career. Button, 34, is out of contract at McLaren at the end of the season and the team are waiting to see how the driver market shakes up before deciding whether to offer the 2009 world champion a new deal. Sportsmail understands that Fernando Alonso of Ferrari is top of McLaren’s short list, with Lewis Hamilton a maverick possibility to return to the team that nurtured his talent. VIDEO Scroll down for Jenson Button takes part in an extraordinary car wash . Uncertain future: Jenson Button's spell at McLaren is in doubt . A source close to McLaren said the hierarchy believe Button is ‘a tenth or two’ short of the speed they want to help them escape the mediocrity of recent seasons. Ron Dennis said after last Sunday’s Austrian Grand Prix that they were ‘not looking to finalise our driver line-up now’ — hardly a ringing endorsement of Button. Much depends on whether Alonso is ready to join McLaren at the start of their engine partnership with Honda, which begins for next season, or would rather see out the final year of his Ferrari contract before committing. It is understood McLaren would have no reluctance in signing Alonso despite the acrimonious year they spent together in 2007. Top target: Fernando Alonso is on McLaren's wish list . Their less favoured option is Hamilton, although he would only leave Mercedes if he loses out on the title to his team-mate Nico Rosberg. Even if Alonso or Hamilton joined, Button could yet be preferred to McLaren’s other driver, rookie Kevin Magnussen. Button is certainly confident the British Grand Prix on July 6 will not be his last. Alternative: Hamilton is an option for McLaren . ‘Not as far as I know,’ he said. ‘I don’t know why McLaren wouldn’t take me for next year. The delay is just the way it is for a big team. We will leave it to the last moment to make a decision.’ Button is popular with the team and sponsors, as well as being experienced and reliable. ‘It’s not necessary to talk about contracts right now because they’ve got other things to focus on, like making the car quicker,’ he said.","Button's contract at McLaren expires at the end of the campaign .

"Military officers have slammed a sexual assault survey as 'intrusive' and 'offensive' after being forced to answer detailed, graphic personal questions. The questionnaire is conducted every two years, taking responses from hundreds of thousands of servicemen and women. However, the Defense Department this year altered the wording to be much more explicit and detailed  in order to get more accurate results as the military struggles to reduce its sexual assaults. 'Intrusive': Nate Galbreath, senior executive adviser for the Department of Defense Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office (SAPRO), has been slammed for the survey which military members brand 'intrusive' Here is a sample question, one of a series of 11 graphic questions out of 34 developed by the Rand Corp. Some are even more detailed: . 'Before 9/18/2013, had anyone made you insert an object or body part into someone's mouth, vagina or anus when you did not want to and did not consent?' A number of military members told The Associated Press that they were surprised and upset by the questions, and some even said they felt re-victimized by the blunt language. None of them would speak publicly by name, but Pentagon officials confirmed they had received complaints that the questions were 'intrusive' and 'invasive.' The survey questions, which were obtained by The Associated Press, ask about any unwanted sexual experiences or contact, and include very specific wording about men's and women's body parts or other objects, and kinds of contact or penetration. It begins with questions about sexual harassment, asking about jokes, 'sexual gestures or sexual body movements,' requests to take or share sexually suggestive pictures or videos or efforts to establish 'an unwanted romantic or sexual relationship.' 'We've had a number of complaints,' said Jill Loftus, director of the Navy's sexual assault prevention program. 'I've heard second- and third-hand that there are a number of women, officers and enlisted, who have gotten to the point where they've read the questions and they've stopped taking the survey. They found them to be either offensive or too intrusive — 'intrusive, invasive' — those are the words they used.' About 560,000 active duty, National Guard and Reserve members were invited to fill out the questionnaire — about five times the number the survey was sent to two years ago. Officials will not say how many responses they have received so far. Early last year, a report on the 2012 anonymous survey results set off a furor when it estimated that 26,000 military members may have been sexually assaulted or subjected to unwanted sexual contact. Exasperated members of Congress complained that the Defense Department wasn't doing enough to combat sexual assault and tried, largely unsuccessfully, to force changes in the Pentagon's legal and command procedures. In addition to the Rand questions, Loftus said the Navy sends its own survey to sailors and Marines that doesn't get as specific. She added, 'We think we've done a very good job of trying to make people aware of what sexual assault is.' But Rand analysts say the more detailed questions are necessary. So does Nate Galbreath, the senior executive adviser for the Pentagon's sexual-assault prevention office. 'This is a crime of a very graphic nature,' Galbreath said. 'For us to improve our understanding, it sometimes requires asking tough questions.' He said the Defense Department hired Rand to develop and conduct the survey this year, based on new direction from Congress that the effort be fully independent of the Pentagon. He was aware of the complaints but said that the more succinct the questions are, the more accurate the results will be. 'Research has told us, if I ask someone, 'Have you ever been raped?' they will say, 'No,'' Galbreath said. 'If I ask that same person, 'Have you ever been forced to engage in sexual activity against your will?' they might say 'Yes.' It's because of the loaded terms like rape and sexual assault, that it's not very clear to a lot of people what we may be asking about.' Kristie Gore, one of the project leaders at Rand, said participants were told they could skip questions they found upsetting, or simply not take the survey. In the end, she said, Rand received a 'relatively small' number of complaints. She said research suggests that 'the discomfort from being asked about prior trauma in a confidential survey is temporary and that such questions cause no additional long-term harm to previously traumatized persons.' Andrew Morral, the other project leader, said the questions were based on the Uniform Code of Military Justice. 'If you don't use precise language to describe different types of sexual assault and harassment, people define those terms for themselves in different ways, which leads to ambiguous results,' he said. The report on the 2012 survey, which was released early last year, showed sexual assault incidents rose from about 19,000 in the 2010 survey to 26,000. Those totals far outdistance the number of sexual assaults that are actually reported by members of the military. According to the latest report, the number of sexual assaults jumped by 50 percent last year as the military worked to get more victims to come forward. Over the past two years, the military services have tried to increase awareness. Phone numbers and contact information for sexual assault prevention officers are plastered across military bases, including inside the doors of bathroom stalls. And top military officers have traveled to bases around the world speaking on the issue. In the 2012 anonymous survey, about 6.8 percent of women who answered said they were assaulted and 1.2 percent of men. There are vastly more men in the military; so by the raw numbers, a bit more than 12,000 women said they were assaulted, compared with nearly 14,000 men.","Thousands of servicemen and women take assault survey every 2 years .

"Liverpool are giving serious consideration to making a move for Chelsea defender Ryan Bertrand as Brendan Rodgers attempts to fill the club’s troublesome left-back position. Bertrand is ready to leave Stamford Bridge this summer in search of regular first-team football after nine years with the club. Liverpool manager Rodgers is a long-term admirer of Bertrand after working with him previously at the Chelsea academy and the 24-year-old has emerged as a serious alternative to Sevilla’s Alberto Moreno. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Bertrand: Work hard play hard on holiday in Marbella . Solution: Liverpool are considering making a bid for Chelsea left-back Ryan Bertrand . Problem position: Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers has struggled to fill his left-back role . The Spanish left-back was one Rodgers’ principal targets at the beginning of the summer but Liverpool are reluctant to meet Sevilla’s asking price, after they demanded a deal in excess of £20million for the 21-year-old defender. Bertrand, who spent the second half of last season on loan at Aston Villa, would be rather more affordable at around £8m and the player is understood to be keen on a move to a club playing Champions League football. Liverpool endured major difficulties at left-back last season following the injury to Jose Enrique and the disappointing form of Aly Cissokho, although John Flanagan did impress in the final few months of the season. Rodgers will also step up his pursuit of Southampton’s Croatian defender Dejan Lovren, with a £15m bid expected to be lodged in the coming weeks.

"Costa Rica coach Jorge Luis Pinto praised his players' character after they overcame a second-half red card, conceded a late leveller and sustained attacks from Greece to reach their first ever World Cup quarter-final. Holland lie in wake for los Ticos after a topsy-turvy encounter in Recife, where they went ahead early in the second half through captain Bryan Ruiz's first-time strike. That looked to be enough for Costa Rica, only for Greece defender Sokratis Papastathopoulos to net a stoppage-time leveller to take the last-16 encounter into extra-time. The match eventually went to penalties and, after man-of-the-match Keylor Navas saved Theofanis Gekas' attempt, Michael Umana struck home to send the Central Americans into the last eight.

Costa Rica goalkeeper Keylor Navas made a number of crucial saves, none bigger than his stop to deny Theofanis Gekas in the shootout. Pinto paid tribute to his goalkeeper, saying: 'I believe he is one of the best in the world. He is the complete protagonist. We trusted him in the shootout. He has grown, he is an extraordinary man and we can recognise his abilities today.' An ecstatic Navas added: 'This is an unbelievable moment and we’re grateful to God for this experience.

"Sabine Lisicki has progressed to the Wimbledon quarter-finals for the fifth year in a row after a 6-3, 3-6, 6-4 victory over Yaroslava Shvedova that was mired in controversy. The German, a beaten finalist last year, clearly angered her Kazakh opponent in the deciding set by walking off court having double-faulted to gift break point in the third game. Lisicki demanded a trainer for a sore right shoulder but Shvedova was initially reluctant to return to her chair at such a key moment in the match.

Respect: Despite her outrage, Shvedova congratulated her opponent after the match . Lisicki denied her choice of medical time-out had been tactical. 'The timing was very unfortunate,' she said. 'I hit a ball before, and it just went into my back. I tried to keep going. I played a few points but I wasn't able to lift my arm. 'It was obvious. I was serving 50 miles an hour or something. I don't remember if I ever served that slow in my life before. That's why I had to call the trainer.' To accusations of gamesmanship, she responded: 'I cannot change their opinion. I just know honest to myself that that hasn't been the case because I really tried to play several more points. 'I have a big respect for my opponent. It's the first time that I had to do it ever.

"Wimbledon champion Andy Murray joked about his position as 'No 2 son' after he scored a Centre Court win and mum Judy chose to watch brother Jamie play doubles. The Scot was pleased Jamie and Australian John Peers had won their doubles match, but jokingly rued his lack of family support.

'My brother's the priority - he's No 1 son - he's always had the preference since I've been a kid, but it's good that we both won.'

"It seems that Hollywood may no longer be the place to go if you want to get rich and famous. A recent breakdown of Tinseltown salaries in The Hollywood Reporter noted that jobs out in sunny California were not only paying less, but getting harder and harder to come by. That being said, it was a great year to be Leonardo DiCaprio in 2013 - just not so much Jonah Hill. Scroll down for video . Queen B: Sandra Bullock (above) took home over $70 million for her work in Gravity . Jo-no: Leonard0 DiCaprio (right) made $25 million for starring in The Wolf of Wall Street, while his buddy Jonah Hill (left) only banked $600,000 . For his work in The Wolf of Wall Street, DiCaprio pocketed a very nice $25 million, while his less genetically blessed costar, Hill, only took home $600,000. Both also walked away from the project with Oscar nominations. When it comes to making bank however, it is all about the back end, something stars like Sandra Bullock and Robert Downey Jr. profited hugely from in 2013. Downey took home $75 million thanks to getting 7% of the earnings from the Marvel blockbuster Iron Man 3, while Bullock really had cause to celebrate after a 15 percent, first-dollar deal on Gravity, a film that made over $700 million worldwide and, as a result, netted her over $70 million. Her efforts also earned her another Best Actress nomination. The iron touch: Robert Downey Jr. (above) made $75 million last year thanks to a 7% back end on the film Iron Man 3 . If film isn't working out however, television is still very welcoming to former big screen stars, with studios getting out their checkbooks for ladies like Halle Berry, Tea Leoni and even Katherine Heigl, who will all appear in American homes every week this season at the cost of $150,000 an episode. Then there is Crystal the monkey, an adorable little creature who earned $108,000 in 2012 for appearing on just nine episodes of the failed NBC sitcom Animal Practice. Had it gone the entire season, she would have taken home $264,000. That's a whole lot more than her porn star pals in the San Fernando Valley are taking home, averaging a salary of $120,000 for an entire year's worth of far more rigorous work. Monkey business: Crystal the monkey (above) made $108,000 for working on just nine episodes of the sitcom Animal Practice . Porn pays: Workers in the adult film industry take home about $120,000 a year . The biggest problem facing many in Hollywood now is that many productions are moving to Louisiana, Georgia and other low-cost states, grabbing local workers who cost far, far less. A stunt person in Los Angeles commands a far higher sum, around $50,000 a film, than a stunt person working in another low-cost state, and to keep costs down many productions are happy to film on location. As for the $50,000, that may seem like a lot, until one takes into account the huge insurance premiums these men and women pay given their line of work. And it does not pay to get hurt. 'I was doubling for Jim Carey in Yes Man, on the back of a scooter on Sunset Boulevard with the girl doubling as Zoeey Deschanel,' recalled stuntman Tom McComas. 'A car that was supposed to slide by us hit us at 50 miles per hour. She shattered her pelvis; I jumped, flipped in the air and herniated a couple of disks.' He went to work the next day, got fired, and was suddenly collecting disability rather than a paycheck. 'Basically we're blue-collar workers who punch the clock,' he added. Safety first: One stunt man recalls getting fired after an injury on the set of Yes Man (above), a movie that made millions for Jim Carey . Speaking of Yes Man, Carey took home 36.2% on the back end of the 2008 release according to Deadline, a move they mocked the actor for at the time as he agreed to forgo any salary for the film. The film made almost $225 million at the box office, which comes out to a little more than $81 million. Even better, Carey herniated no discs during production.","A new report reveals how much everyone in Hollywood is making these days, from actors and assistants to porn stars and animal talent .

"'The biggest mistake of my life': Paul Hollywood and his former lover Marcela Valladolid . She hit the headlines for her scandalous affair with Great British Bake Off judge Paul Hollywood. But now his ex-mistress Marcela Valladolid is celebrating moving on with her life – by announcing she is expecting her second child. Chef Valladolid, 36, embarked on a fling with Hollywood – dubbed the ‘George Clooney of baking’ – after they co-starred together in a US version of the baking show last year. He briefly split with wife Alexandra but the pair have since reunited. Valladolid is now dating top Hollywood agent Phillip Button and took to her Instagram page last week to post a sonogram snap of their unborn child saying: ‘Good morning, world, what’s happening out there?’ Valladolid has a ten-year-old son Fausto from a previous marriage. She confirmed her happy news in a statement, saying: ‘Fau asks daily about the gender of the baby and has already picked out names for both a brother and a sister. Scroll down for video . ‘He’s been asking for a really long time for a baby brother or sister and is thrilled it’s finally happening.’ Hollywood called the affair ‘the biggest mistake of my life.’ 'Good morning world': The Mexican Made Easy host seemingly confirmed the news as she shared a photo of sonogram on her Instagram just over a week ago .

"A pilot  who flew on a mission to West Africa and began experiencing ‘flu-like symptoms’ when he returned home was tested for Ebola but has been declared free of the deadly virus. The pilot from the 437th Airlift Wing based in Charleston, South Carolina, flew to Liberia  on a three-hour mission on October 23. He  began experiencing ‘flu-like symptoms' when he arrived back in the U.S but was considered low risk because he never left the plane. Ebola free: Members of the 437th Airlift Wing based in Charleston, South Carolina stand beside their plane, this week one of their pilots was tested for the Ebola Virus . Isolation pod: The patient was transported to the hospital in an ‘isolation pod’ to minimise the risk of spreading any possible infection . Low risk: This week, doctors at the Medical University of South Carolina where he was being treated downgraded him from ‘low risk’ to ‘no risk’ of Ebola. This week, doctors at the Medical University of South Carolina where he was being treated downgraded him from being ‘low risk’ to having ‘no risk’ of Ebola. However, doctors say they will continue to monitor him as an extra precaution. MUSC spokesman Tony Ciuffo said: ’In consultation with DHEC, CDC and the Department of Defense, it has been confirmed that the patient had no contact with anyone in Liberia, and based on this information, he has been determined to have no risk for Ebola.' 'The patient will be removed from Ebola precautions, and no quarantine will be required.’ According to Staff Sergeant Anthony Hyatt, the serviceman, who lives off-base, began experiencing the symptoms on Wednesday, and was transported to MUSC on Friday morning. Officials from Joint Base Charleston coordinated with the state's Department of Health and Environmental Control to exercise ‘the appropriate protocols and an abundance of caution.' According to the U.S. Department of Defense pilots who travel to and from an airfield of a country where an Ebola outbreak is occurring will not be held for controlled monitoring if they meet the following guidelines: . The hospital which is an 'Ebola ready' hospital swung into action to deal with the serviceman according to Fox News Carolina. It is one of three hospitals in the state prepared to take on Ebola patients and has an isolation wing. MUSC spokesperson Heather Woolwine said; ‘Late yesterday evening, we got a patient who required an Ebola medical screening.’ The patient was then transported to the hospital in an ‘isolation pod’ to keep the risk of spreading any possible infection between the patient and attending medical staff to a minimum. He was treated on an isolated ward and anyone who treated him was required to wear protective gear. Hyat said: 'Servicemen who travel to the countries in Africa which have been affected by Ebola are monitored for 21 days, and so far, only the pilot in question has shown any adverse symptoms.’ ‘MUSC followed protective protocol as a precautionary measure.’ ‘The patient remains in isolation and the initial assessment indicates the patient is unlikely to have Ebola,’ MUSC said. No risk: The pilot was cleared of Ebola as he only spent three hours in the region and never left the plane . Monitor: Servicemen who travel to Ebola-affected countries in Africa are monitored for 21 days . Outbreak: The World Health Organization said nearly 5,000 people have died from the Ebola virus disease in the three West African countries at the center of the current Ebola outbreak . ‘However we will continue to monitor the patient closely in the isolation unit.’ The pilot landed at an airport in Liberia which was operated by U.S. personnel who had no contact with Ebola patients. Its American personnel also self-monitor for adverse symptoms twice daily. Hyatt added: ‘Upon landing, the crew left their engines running and remained on the flight deck for the entirety of their three hours and nine minutes on the ground.’ ‘In other words, there were many layers of separation put in place to protect transiting aircrew.’ Hyatt also confirmed that no food from Liberia was served to crews while the plane was on the ground. According to the World Health Organization, nearly 5,000 people have died from the Ebola virus disease in the three West African countries at the center of the current Ebola outbreak. A total of 4,950 people have died of Ebola in the three countries, the WHO said. The United Nations health agency said 13,241 confirmed, suspected or probable cases of Ebola had been reported in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone -  the three worst affected countries.","The pilot was from the 437th Airlift Wing based in South Carolina .

"Braces are an awkward and often painful rite of passage for many teenagers, but they can transform the most crooked teeth into Hollywood smiles. A strangely captivating time-lapse video reveals how an 11-year-old-girl’s warped teeth were transformed over just 18-months. It shows how her top teeth move down and into more uniform positions, as the wire straightens across her braces. Scroll down for video . Before: A strangely captivating time-lapse video reveals how an 11-year-old-girl’s warped teeth (pictured) were transformed in 18-months by braces. It shows how her teeth move down and into more uniform positions, as the wire straightens across her braces . She was treated by Dr Thomas Rocke of Kesling & Rocke Orthodontic Group in Westville, Indiana. People wear braces for cosmetic as well as structural reasons, such as correcting their bite and repositioning crooked teeth. While braces may be seen as a modern ‘extra’ when it comes to health and dental treatments, there is evidence that ancient people wrapped metal bands around their teeth in a bid to strengthen them. After: She was treated by Dr Thomas Rocke of Kesling & Rocke Orthodontic Group in Westville, Indiana and this still shows her teeth following the 18 month orthodontic treatment . People wear braces for cosmetic as well as structural reasons, such as correcting their bite and repositioning crooked teeth. The girl is pictured left, before wearing braces and right, after the treatment . Aristotle mulled ways to straighten teeth in 380AD and archaeologists have found mummies that appear to have metal bands wrapped around their teeth. Sometimes a cord made from animal intestine was used to straighten teeth. A Roman tomb revealed teeth bound with gold wire. In 1728, French dentist Pierre Fauchard wrote a book on methods of straightening teeth and is credited with inventing modern orthodontics. He used a horseshoe-shaped piece of iron to expand the arch of teeth. In the 19th century the field of orthodontics was officially recognised and new devices invented. Gum elastics were first used and it was decided that mild force at timed intervals is the best way of encouraging the movement of teeth. In the early 20th century, Edward Angle devised a classification system for crooked teeth, which is still used today. Braces are able to move teeth by applying pressure on them. Traditional braces comprise of four elements: brackets, bonding material, arch wire and ligature elastics, known as ‘o-rings’ to align teeth. Teeth move when the arch wire puts pressure on the brackets, which are bonded to the teeth. O-rings are sometimes used to generate force in order to pull teeth in a certain direction. The tension of the arch wire is set at regular orthodontic appointments - typically a month apart - so that the correct amount of pressure is applied slowly over time. When pressure is applied on the teeth, their periodontal membrane stretches on one side and is compressed on the other. This loosens the teeth so that new bone grows to support them in their new positions. The process is called bone remodelling, which is the biomechanical process responsible for making bones stronger. If too much pressure is applied too quickly, the teeth can be loosened too fast for new bone to grow, meaning that a patient can be at risk of losing their teeth.","Video reveals how an 11-year-old's crooked teeth were fixed in 18-months .
