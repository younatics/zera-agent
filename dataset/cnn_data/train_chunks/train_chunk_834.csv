"Martin 'Mad Dog' Allen returns with the latest installment of his weekly column for MailOnline Sport. The Barnet boss does not hold back with his views on current issues in football. THE BIG QUESTION – Wayne Rooney: in or out? I reckon Roy Hodgson will pick Wayne and play him in a role behind Daniel Sturridge. I think he’ll do a similar thing to Sir Alex Ferguson and play Rooney off the front and against Italy tell him to watch Andrea Pirlo. Leader: Roy Hodgson is likely to select Wayne Rooney (above) behind Daniel Sturridge . He is Italy’s pass master, their . catalyst, who wants to dictate and control the game. In the old days . when the cavalries would ride into battle they used to target the . general at the back, sitting on his white horse. As soon as . you got to him the attackers knew the rest of the soldiers would . scarper without their leader. Pirlo is the general on that horse but the . Italians are not renowned through history for being great battlers. If Rooney and England can stop Pirlo, then I don’t think this Italian team will be up for the battle. Maestro: England must stop Andrea Pirlo if they are to have any chance against Italy . MY ENGLAND SCOUTING REPORT . JOE HART . Shows good body language and good distribution but can be poor on crosses, particularly from corners. Looks confident but at times he could be overconfident. GLEN JOHNSON . Has been poor attacking in the final third in the friendlies and was not tested defensively one v one. He can be poor in possession and always looks like he’s got an error in his game. GARY CAHILL . A strong, dominant header of the ball in both boxes. He is growing as a leader but he does lack a bit of pace in tight areas and can be average in possession . Safe hands: Joe Hart's confidence will help the team build from the back . Solid: Gary Cahill (left) and Phil Jagielka (right) are strong in the air but lack pace at the top level . PHIL JAGIELKA . A whole-hearted player and a leader. Attacks the ball well in the air at both ends and wants to score at set plays. His passing could be better but he is a fraction too slow to be top level. LEIGHTON BAINES . Is average defending the far post from crosses and can be guilty of poor one on one defending around his own box. He has good pace going forward but lacks real quality deep in the final third. STEVEN GERRARD . Now playing a deeper role and is England’s quarter back. Can open teams up and is very good switching the play and shows good discipline in the role, rarely leaving the middle of the pitch. Shield: Steven Gerrard and Jordan Henderson can protect the back four in deep-lying midfielder roles . JORDAN HENDERSON . An energetic midfielder and a good athlete who has an eye for a goal, particularly around the edge of the box. He is a simple passer and links play well, but he is not a spectacular player. DANNY WELBECK . A great athlete, particularly tracking opposition full backs and shows good energy. Always has a positive attitude on the ball whether through passing or running with it but lacks real technical skill. WAYNE ROONEY . Will sit tight and play on Pirlo. Has lost a yard of pace but links play so well. He is one of England’s leaders and has the technical ability to score around the box. With the hot conditions I feel the whole game will be too much for him, so expect him to be replaced after 60 minutes for a lad called Barkley. Leading the way: Daniel Sturridge can be extremely dangerous from outside the box . RAHEEM STERLING . Quick, tenacious and always positive in possession, he has the speed to break between the lines and do damage in the final third. He is all right foot but anything can happen with this kid. Beware. DANIEL STURRIDGE . Can be magic, can be a match-winner and can be bang average. But around the box he’s always looking to try and get a shot in and needs to be watched carefully. SUBSTITUTE . Roy will make plenty of changes but the boy Barkley is the closest to Gazza I’ve seen. He’s got tricks, skills, top technical ability and is always looking to score or find an incisive pass to create a scoring opportunity. When this boy comes on something will happen. Wing wizard: Raheem Sterling (left) offers pace and tenacity from the flanks . Back-up: Adam Lallana misses out on a place in the starting line-up against Italy . BROKEN DREAMS . Well, what did you expect? With just days to go and a lifetime’s dreams ahead, one bad tackle, one poor challenge or a bit of hard luck and you’re out of the World Cup. Over the last 10 days we have seen Italy’s Riccardo Montolivo break his leg, Franck Ribery of France hurt his back and Germany’s Marco Reus injure his ankle. Playing against Honduras, who are extremely physical with strong athletic, tough players, was a tricky encounter for the last warm-up game for the young lions. But thankfully they came through and there was no way they were going to over exert themselves and put themselves in danger missing out. Agony: Marco Reus is one of several talented stars set to miss the World Cup with injury . P.S. As a very passionate Englishman who loves the flag of St George, is very proud of his country, who was stood in South Africa with the barmy army supporting our cricket team and as an England supporter watched the team in the World Cup in Cape Town and Port Elizabeth after doing the full length of South Africa’s famous Garden Route in a Fiat Panda in just one day to get there in time, I cannot and will never, ever pick anybody to beat my beloved England. Forget Messi, Ronaldo, Neymar and the rest of them. For me it’s Rule Britannia. England to win it. Believe: Forget the likes of Lionel Messi and Neymar, England can lift the 2014 World Cup trophy . My week... On Tuesday I played in the Redgrave and Pinsent Celebrity Classic at the Sparks charity golf day at Harleyford Golf Club. It’s a lovely spot just between Marlow and Henley-on-Thames down by the river. Both gentlemen are big enough and strong enough to look like Micky Droy, Chelsea’s famously tough centre back but they helped raise a great deal of money for the charity, which does vital research into children’s healthcare. And once again Sparks put on a tremendous day. As the speeches at the end of the day were being made, Sir Matthew revealed that he’d brought along with him a little box that we might all want to look at. Rewarding: Sir Steve Redgrave promised to bring his five gold medal to the next Celebrity Classic . Everyone was intrigued until he opened . the box and inside were four small, saucer-sized Olympic gold medals. He . then, believe it or not, gave them to the first table of golfers and . guests and they were nonchalantly passed around the room for us all to . take pictures and touch the gold medals. It was pretty magical from such . a humble Olympic hero. Sir Steve congratulated everyone taking part and . thanked Matthew for bringing his four gold medals. He ended the day by . saying next time he would have to bring his box with five in it.","Andrea Pirlo must be stopped if England are going to defeat Italy .

"By . Paul Bantley . Caroline Baines, outside London's High Court. She is locked in a bitter legal dispute with her mother, also an estate agent, whom she accuses of 'harrassing'  her . A mother and daughter ‘aired their dirty laundry’ yesterday in a bitter £150,000 court battle over the family estate agency. Nicola Low, 71, is being sued by Caroline Baines, 40, who claims her mother reduced her salary while she was on maternity leave. She is also accused of harassing her daughter and making malicious complaints about her to police. The High Court in London was told Mrs Low did not visit Mrs Baines after she had her baby and could not remember her grandson’s birthday. In a counter-claim, Mrs Low is suing her daughter for setting up a new agency and allegedly stealing her clients. The pair ran their lettings agency Halcyon House together until their catastrophic falling-out at the beginning of 2010. Mrs Baines had expected her normal four-figure monthly wage but was told she would receive statutory maternity pay like other staff. From wanting to hand her business to her daughter Mrs Low now ‘wanted to take her out of the equation’, barrister James Purnell said. To this end, she began ‘nit-picking and looking for problems,’ the lawyer told the court. She allegedly berated her daughter about her work just two weeks after she had an emergency caesarean. Mrs Low claims they fell out after her daughter ‘helped herself’ to company money to make up the shortfall in her maternity pay. Mrs Baines denies this. The feud led to Mrs Baines setting up a rival estate agency in Welwyn Garden City, Hertfordshire. Mrs Low is claiming up to £100,000 from her daughter, alleging breach of contract and failure in her duty as a Halcyon House director. But Mrs Baines and her business colleague, Sue Mogridge, are counter-suing Mrs Low for more than £50,000, claiming harassment, including alleged ‘spiteful and malicious’ complaints to the police and professional bodies. Appearing in the witness box, Mrs Low was accused of prioritising control of the business over her relationship with her daughter. ‘You wanted to discipline Caroline and remove her. You berated her just two weeks after she had a C-section,’ Mr Purnell said. The High Court heard that Mrs Baines claims her mother Nicola Low decided to slash her pay whilst she was on maternity leave, giving birth to her son Henry. But Mrs Low (pictured with her son outside court) said she offered her daughter the statutory maternity pay . ‘Your first contact with your own daughter after she had an unplanned caesarean section was to send round a courier to deliver a letter about the business.’ He added: ‘You don’t even know the birthday of your own grandchild.’ Mrs Low denied the allegations but, when pressed, said she thought Henry’s birthday was February 20. In fact it is the 16th. She said: ‘I wanted to give the business to my daughter, who I was trying to protect, but I also had a duty to protect the business.’ Mrs Low had been intending to hand the reins of the business Halycon House to her daughter in the near future and retire, but the tension between the pair spilled over into their professional lives . She added: ‘I very much object to washing my dirty laundry in public.’ Setting out the mother’s case, Judge Richard Seymour QC said: ‘What Halcyon is seeking is damages for loss of business and the vital thing is whether Mrs Low can prove that contact was made by way of pinching the clients.’ Of Mrs Baines’s harassment case, he said: ‘The daughter says malicious complaints were made spitefully in order to make life difficult. ‘This mother and daughter are entitled, if they cannot resolve their difficulties between themselves, to have their differences settled for them by the court.’ The hearing continues.

"By . Louise Cheer . and Aap . Doctors are still administering a flu vaccination that is banned from being used on children under five after it caused a five-year-old girl to become severely disabled. The use of bioCSL Fluvax on children under five years old was blacklisted after an increase in febrile convulsions in children was linked to the vaccine in 2010. Febrile convulsions, or febrile seizures, occur when normal brain activity is interrupted by a fever and usually it happens without warning. Scroll down for video . Doctors are still administering the bioCSL Fluvax to children under five four years after it was banned of that use . So far this year, there have been 31 reported cases of the bioCSL Fluvax being administered to children under the age of five. It has dropped since last year when there were 43 reported cases. Australia's chief medical officer Professor Baggoley said doctors still giving the vaccine 'defies belief'. Prof Baggoley said he had sent out letters to doctors and took other measures to inform them. He admitted this year's figures were low, considering 48,360 children under five were given other suitable flu jabs last year. There were also no reports of adverse events. So far this year, there have been 31 cases of the flu vaccine used on children in this age group . The Federal Department of Health advises that the vaccination should only be used in children five to nine years old after careful consideration of the benefits and risks. In response to the banning of the use of bioCSL Fluvax in children under five, the Therapeutic Goods Authority ordered all sides of the packaging be plastered with a warning that reads: 'Do not use in children under five years' in white text on a red label. Its product information pamphlet also contained a black box warning with a similar message. As well as that magnets to put on vaccine fridges were distributed amongst doctors reminding them not to use it on kids that fell in that age group.","The vaccine was banned in 2010 after an increase in seizures in children .

"By . Ryan Gorman . and Associated Press Reporter . A civilian employee of the Coast Guard in Alaska was convicted Friday of the 2012 shooting deaths of two of his co-workers at a remote base originally thought to be the work of a bizarrely-tattooed drifter charged in a separate murder. James Wells, 62, was found guilty of murdering Coast Guardsmen Petty Officer 1st Class James Hopkins and retired Chief Petty Officer Richard Belisle - but his defense team vehemently denied his guilt and tried to blame the murders on another man. The 15-member federal jury took only six . hours to reach a verdict after the month-long trial. They found Wells . guilty of two counts each of first-degree murder, murder of an officer . or employee of the United States, and possession of a firearm in a crime . of violence. Accused killer: Jason 'Eyeball' Barnum was accused of killing an Anchorage police officer only months after Belisle and Hopkins were shot dead . Wells showed no emotion as the verdict was read, according to KTUU, but relatives of his victims burst into tears. Federal . prosecutors earlier said they would not seek the death penalty if Wells . was convicted. His sentencing was set for July 8. He will likely spend the rest of his life in jail. It is not clear if he plans to appeal. Investigators revealed during the trial that Wells put . together an almost-air tight alibi before sneaking on to the base April . 12, 2012 to kill the two men, their bodies were found in the station's rigger shop, where antennas are built and repaired. Prosecutors contended Wells, a Coast . Guard civilian technician, resented the growing influence of Belisle and . Hopkins in the shop where he was a nationally recognized antenna . expert. They said he meticulously planned an alibi, sneaked onto the . communications station and gunned them down. Wells . made it home after the shooting and called Hopkins' work phone, leaving . a message saying he would be late for work because of a flat tire, . officials claimed. Eyeball . But his defense team argued it was Jason 'Eyeball' Barnum that pulled the trigger. Barnum, known as 'eyeball' for both . the tattoo on his right eyeball that has permanently colored the eye . black and an illustration of an eyeball on his forehead, declined recognizing the names of either . man while in court with the jury out of the room, according to the . Anchorage Daily News. The 38-year-old also refused to answer when asked if he took drugs the day of the murders or whether he killed the two men. 'I don't want to answer that,' he said. Wells' defense team claims the man - currently being held on charges he gunned . down an Anchorage police officer - took drugs the day of the murders . and skipped town before being caught. He acknowledged in court being on . the island during the killings and leaving shortly after. FBI . agents talked to Barnum in the months after the double murder while . making it clear he wasn't a suspect, but he refused to answer any of . their questions. Barnum's . testimony was then sought by the defense team because he was a known . acquaintance of an ex-con who dated Belisle's teen daughter, according . to the paper. She admitted to having past drug problems and dating the . former convict. They once worked together: This July 2, 2011 file photo provided by the U.S. Coast Guard shows Richard Belisle, second from left, and Coast Guard Petty Officer 1st Class James Hopkins, second from right, with Jim Wells, left, and Coast Guard Petty Officer 3rd Class Cody Beauford as they help erect a communications antenna on Shemya Island, Alaska . Dead: Belisle, shown here in 2011 after killing a caribou, was gunned down at the Coast Guard base . Remote: The base is located on Kodiak Island, about 250 miles south of Anchorage . Prosecutors were able to convince the . judge the already-accused killer had nothing to do with the Kodiak . murders and would only be brought to the witness stand 'to frighten the . jury,' according to the paper. They then proceeded to mount their case against Wells, saying he . committed the cold-blooded killings because he became jealous of the . pair's growing influence at the island base. Hopkins, 41, was an electronics technician from Vergennes, Vermont. Belisle, 51, was a former chief petty officer who continued service to the Coast Guard as a civilian employee at the base about 250 miles south of the state capital Anchorage. In memorial: Former colleagues hold a plaque dedicated to Chief Petty Officer Richard Belisle, retired, and Petty Officer 1st Class Jim Hopkins during a memorial held at the unit on April 12, 2013 . Prosecutors say the flat tire was a ruse to give him a cover story for committing the murders. Wells told the FBI he started driving to work, detected a soft tire, stopped at a hotel near the Kodiak airport entrance, checked the tire and returned home to change it, authorities said. Unbeknownst to Wells, a security camera at the nearby Coast Guard main gate recorded his truck heading for the communication station shortly before 7 a.m. and driving in the opposite direction toward his home 34 minutes later. Wells' wife was out of town the day of the shooting, and her blue SUV was parked at the Kodiak airport. Investigators concluded Wells switched cars, waited for Hopkins to drive by, followed him to the communications station and shot him and Belisle. Federal public defender Rich Curtner said in his opening statement that Wells suffered from chronic diarrhea following gall bladder surgery and was delayed the morning of the murders because he spent 20 minutes in a bathroom of a commuter airline. Wells made no mention of using an airport bathroom to the FBI. Curtner and defense attorney Peter Offenbecher of Seattle contended authorities immediately focused on Wells and ignored other possible suspects, including 'eyeball.' They said prosecutors had no eyewitnesses, no confession, no murder weapon and no physical evidence linking Wells to the homicides. Wells served eight years in the Navy and 13 with the Coast Guard. Upon discharge in 1990, he was hired as a civilian employee. Kodiak Island is home to the largest Coast Guard Air Station in the . Pacific. The double homicide took place 3 miles away at the base's . communications station, where personnel monitor radio traffic from ships . and planes.","Jason 'Eyeball' Barnum was questioned in the killings and declined to speak both to the FBI and in court .

"By . Steve Doughty . The annual British social attitudes poll revealed that 95 per cent of the population think immigrants should speak English (file picture) Most people in Britain think immigrants should speak English and have their access to benefits restricted, but there is a ‘disconnect’ between politicians’ attitudes and public opinion on the issue, a survey has found. The annual British social attitudes poll revealed that 95 per cent of the population think the English language is the cornerstone of Britishness. Around three out of four said you must be born in Britain or have lived here for most of your life to be classified as British, and six out of ten think EU migrants should wait three years before claiming benefits. The poll of 3,000 people was carried out by the state-funded NatCen group last year. It found that politicians contributed to anti-immigrant sentiment because of a ‘growing disconnect’ between the ‘Liberal political class’ and mainstream public opinion on the issue. The study says: ‘There is a clear and intense demand for action on the issue from one section of the electorate, a demand that politicians ignore at their peril. ‘Yet responding to the concerns of the voters worried about immigration today risks alienating the rising sections of the electorate whose political voice will become steadily louder in elections to come.’ The survey, which has been run every year since 1983, found there has been a hardening of attitudes to immigration in the last decade – the numbers of participants who believe that people must speak English to be British has gone up from 86 per cent to 95 per cent. Across the same period, the percentage of people who say that to be British you must have lived here most of your life has gone up from 69 per cent to 77 per cent. The survey also revealed that 77 per cent want immigration reduced. The survey by NatCen also revealed that 77 per cent people in the UK want immigration reduced (file picture). The same percentage believe people have to have lived in the UK for most of their adult life to be British . NatCen’s chief executive Penny Young said: ‘In an increasingly diverse, multi-cultural country, we might expect people to be more relaxed about what it means to be British, yet the trend is going in the opposite direction. 'It is now harder to be considered British than in the past and one message comes through loud and clear, if you want to be British, you must speak English. ‘As we debate whether Ukip’s vote will hold up in the general election, the survey shows that the public is yet to be convinced that politicians have got a grip on immigration.' Scots would like to keep the trappings of British life even if they vote to become independent, according to the poll. The British social attitudes survey found that nearly two thirds of Scots would like to keep the Queen, four out of five want to keep the pound, and only one in seven would lose the BBC. The majority also want to keep Trident submarines and the nuclear deterrent at Faslane. But one in three people in England and Wales think Trident submarines should be based outside an independent Scotland. Professor John Curtice from NatCen said: ‘If Scotland does leave the United Kingdom, Scotland and England will have to find ways of getting along.’","Annual British social attitudes poll of 3,000 people revealed latest findings .

The Australian War Memorial is the world's 17th best attraction as judged by TripAdvisor travellers . The memorial beat out other landmarks such as Rio de Janiero's Christ the Redeemer and Sydney Opera House . It drew praise for its in-depth look at the Anzacs' involvement in wars, and its moving and reflective atmosphere. Traveller Eileen K, from the United Kingdon, said it was 'as splendid as the Taj Mahal'. 'The war memorial is one of the most beautiful I have ever seen,' she wrote. 'I can't find the right words to describe how moving it is.' Another fellow traveller - also from the UK - PetGill17 agreed, saying it was a must-see. 'The Australia War Memorial is the most sincere place I have ever visited,' they wrote. San Francisco's Golden Gate Bridge came in at 21 (left) and Rio's Christ the Redeemer (right) came in at 22 . Whitsundays' Whitehaven Beach in Queensland was named as fifth best beach in the world . 'It does not glorify war, but you feel humbled by the way in which those who died have been remembered. 'The folly of war and the suffering are clearly there for all to see and it was heart-warming to see so many families coming to pay their respects and to educate their children about the bravery and the sacrifice of so many fellow countrymen and women so they can have the life they enjoy today.' The memorial and the opera house were the only two Australian attractions that made the top 25 list. As for world destinations, Sydney was the only Australian city or town that made it into the top 25 coming in at 22, and naturally it took out top spot in national rankings as well. Other Aussie successes on the TripAdvisor lists were Queensland's Whitehaven Beach in the Whitsundays taking out fifth best beach in the world, followed by Exmouth's Turquoise Bay in 20 and Broome's Cable Beach in 22. Travellers loved Whitehaven's picture perfect views of the ocean. Noelene R R, from South Africa, said it was 'a bit of heaven' after visiting the beach on a day trip. 'Words cannot describe the feeling you have being a part of this amazing place,' she said. 'The care taken to keep it pristine is commendable too and I cried when we left, such was the impact of visiting this fabulous place.' AlistarHawkwind said it was an 'unspoilt beauty' and it lived up to its namesake . 'This is quite simply the most beautiful place I've ever seen, twice, ' he said. 'The sand is the purest silica in the the world, and white, white, white. Feels like fine flour.' Sydney Opera House took out 25th place, trailing behind the war memorial .

"By . Lydia Warren . A 14-year-old boy has been charged with murder for stabbing his classmate to death with a kitchen knife outside their school gates. Noel Estevez allegedly used a kitchen knife to stab 14-year-old Timothy Crump three times in the torso after school in the Bronx, New York on Wednesday. Witnesses said that Estevez pulled out a knife after Crump punched him, while friends claimed the deadly dispute came after weeks of Crump bullying his killer - beating him, teasing him for his mother's recent drugs bust and leading him to attempt suicide. Estevez was charged with second degree murder and second degree manslaughter on Wednesday night. He's being charged as an adult, police . sources told the New York Daily News. Scroll down for video . Dispute: Noel Estevez, left, allegedly stabbed Timothy Crump, right, repeatedly in the torso, killing him, as they left school on Wednesday. Friends claimed Crump had bullied Estevez . The bloody scene unfolded after the teens were let out of class at I.S. 117 around 3pm. Several boys said they saw Crump confront Estevez as they left school, before punching him and kneeing him in the nose, the New York Times reported. In retaliation, Estevez pulled out his knife and stabbed Crump as teachers and school safety officers ran over to stop the fight, they said. Chailyn Oballe, 12, added to amNewYork that she was leaving classes for the day when she saw a group huddling outside the school. 'And . that's when I saw the boy with the knife,' she said. 'He looked like . he was about to stab somebody else and then he put the knife in his . pocket and covered it with his shirt.' As he tried to leave, people scattered screaming 'someone has a knife' and the boy was stopped by a security guard. Charged: Estevez can be seen center being hauled in for questioning on Wednesday night. He has now been charged with second degree murder and has been charged as an adult, police said . Crump was taken to Bronx-Lebanon Hospital where he was pronounced dead and a knife was recovered outside the school, Department of Education Spokeswoman Marge Feinberg said. Those who knew the boys, who were friends on Facebook, have given differing accounts of their relationship. Police sources told the New York Daily News that Estevez attacked Crump because he had beaten him and robbed him a few weeks ago, and other friends said he had long been bullied by Crump. 'Timothy is one of the kids that is constantly bullying Noel,' Estevez’s neighbor Stephany Arroyo, 23, said. '(He . would say) things like, ""Ha ha, your mom's a crackhead, you're . stuttering, you don't got no food stamps, you're mom’s locked up!.' The boy's mother was arrested on drug charges last week, Arroyo said, which Crump 'found funny.' She said he and his friends would hang outside Estevez's building, threatening him. The treatment eventually left Estevez suicidal, another family friend, Marisol Perez, said. Crime scene: Authorities gather outside the school where the teenager was stabbed after class . Fight: Witnesses said they saw Crump punching Estevez before Estevez pulled out the knife . Arrest: A security guard reportedly stopped the fight outside the school, IS 177, and the boy was arrested . 'Two . weeks ago he tried to hang himself in his own apartment,' Perez said. 'His . father found him hanging himself in the closet with a rope.' Estevez was recently released from the hospital and returned to school this week, even though he told his father he didn't want to go because of the bullies. 'His father brought him to school this morning and said, ""Don’t worry, just go straight home after school"",' Perez said. But Crump's neighbors at a shelter called the boy quiet - and branded Estevez as the bully. 'He wanted to make it look like he was the victim,' Tyrone Rivers said. 'He'd say, ""I run this block, I’m going to get my gun and shoot you."" I’ve seen him say it.' Grief counselors will be available at the school on Thursday.

"By . Associated Press . and Daily Mail Reporter . The Walmart truck driver who smashed into comedian Tracy Morgan's limo van - seriously injuring him and two others and killing another man - was speeding before the crash, a report has revealed. The preliminary report released on Thursday by the National Transportation Safety Board said that trucker Kevin Roper was driving 65 mph for the 60 seconds before the June 7 crash. But about a half-mile south of the crash on the northbound New Jersey Turnpike, signs advised drivers to slow from 55 mph to 45 mph because of construction ahead, the report said. Questions: Kevin Roper, in court on June 11, was driving the truck that hit a limo van on June 7, killing one man and injuring comedian Tracy Morgan. On Thursday, a preliminary report by the NTSB revealed that he had been speeding . The NTSB used the truck's electronic engine-control system to calculate how fast Roper was driving. Wal-Mart Stores Inc. trucks are equipped with devices that limit the vehicles' speed to 65 mph, a spokeswoman said, so Roper was going at the top speed possible. Drivers are required to follow the posted speed limit under Wal-Mart policy, spokeswoman Brooke Buchanan said on Thursday. 'Of course we expect our drivers to comply with the laws, whether it's a speed limit, or (something else),' she said. 'We don't condone speeding.' In the report, officials also said that Roper had been on duty for 13 hours and 32 minutes, which is half an hour below the federal limit. He had been driving for nine hours and 37 minutes. Hurt: Morgan, pictured in 2012, was seriously injured in the New Jersey crash and remains hospitalized . A criminal complaint also alleged that . he had not slept for more than 24 hours before the crash, but the NTSB . said in its report that it is still investigating how much rest he had. It concluded that Roper left a . Wal-Mart facility in Smyrna, Delaware, at about 11.30am on June 6 and . made stops in Delaware, New Jersey and Pennsylvania during the day. Just . after midnight on June 7 he left Bristol, Pennsylvania, en route to . Perth Amboy, New Jersey, when the crash happened about 30 minutes into . his trip. The truck . struck Morgan's limo from behind, sending it into other vehicles and . eventually onto its side. The limo van was carrying Morgan and six . others. The 45-year-old . former 'Saturday Night Live' and '30 Rock' star suffered broken ribs . and a broken leg, while his friend and fellow comedian James McNair, 63, . was killed. Wreck: An image taken the night of the June 7 crash shows the limo van flipped over after the collision . Crash: Roper was driving this Walmart truck when he hit the van carrying Morgan and six other people . Just before his . death, McNair, who was laid to rest in Peeskill, New York last week, . had been helping Morgan work on material for his new stand-up routine. This week, Morgan's condition was upgraded to fair condition. 'His personality is certainly starting to come back as well,' spokesman Lewis Kay said. Morgan's . assistant, Jeffrey Millea, has also been upgraded to fair condition, . Kay said. Hospital officials said comedian Ardie Fuqua remains in . critical condition. Comedian Harris Stanton, 37, was released from hospital last week with a broken wrist. New . Jersey prosecutors have charged Roper, who is from Jonesboro, Georgia, . with vehicular homicide and assault, but he has pleaded not guilty. Remembered: Mourners gathered for comedian James McNair's funeral in Peeskill, New York last weekend . A conviction on a death by auto charge . carries a five to 10-year prison sentence. Each assault by auto charge . is punishable by up to 18 months in prison. Following a hearing earlier this month, Roper, 35, was released on $50,000 bail.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A Florida man celebrating the homecoming of his newborn daughter is dead after a stray bullet allegedly fired by his ex-con neighbor went through his backdoor and hit him in the head earlier this week. To make the tragic death even more heartbreaking, 33-year-old Justin Ayers daughter was born on Sunday - Father's Day. Authorities in Panama City were called to Ayers' home about 6:12 p.m. Tuesday, after a someone called 9-1-1 to report that he had been shot while standing in his home with friends and family celebrating his daughter's homecoming. Tragic: Justin Ayers was shot dead in his kitchen while celebrating bringing his newborn daughter home from the hospital . Felon: Neighbor Charles Shisler admitted to firing the shot with a gun he possessed illegally because he is a convicted felon . Crime scene: Police say the bullet went through a glass door in the back of Ayers' home (pictured) Officers found a bullet hole in the sliding-glass door in the rear of the home and did a perimeter check of the property, which is when they found Ayers' neighbor Charles Shisler - a convicted felon who is not permitted to be in possession of a fire arm - in his backyard directly behind Ayers' property. Authorities says Shisler has admitted to firing the shot while in his own home. 'The bullet traveled from within his residence, through his yard, . through a wooded area that was probably 20 feet, through the back yard . of the victim’s residence, through the sliding glass and across that . residence,'  Major Tommy Ford of the Bay County Sheriff’s Office tells WMBB. As of Wednesday, Shisler has been charged with manslaughter and possession of a firearm by a convicted felon. However, police are still trying to figure out exactly what caused Shisler to discharge the weapon. Talent: Ayers (right) was a musician who friends say was dedicated to his family and his craft . 'We are trying to determine based on the forensic evidence and limited . information that we have what truly occurred, what caused the shot,' Ford said. Shisler's prior felony conviction stems from an incident in 2006, when he was arrested for carrying a concealed weapon without a permit. But this isn't the first time police have been called to Shisler's home after a neighbor heard gunfire. Police confirmed to WMBB that officers were dispatched to Shisler's home in March when a neighbor called to report hearing gun shots. Police entered Shisler's home to investigate, but he convinced the officers that the sound came from fireworks. Police note that two people with Shisler also said the noise was caused by fireworks. No weapon was visible inside of Shisler's home, so the officer left without filing any charges. Support: Ayers' friends say his family has a good support base and that it will be tough, but they will get through it . Meanwhile, friends of the aspiring musician are heartbroken. 'I had just gotten a picture of him and the baby which was just born . father’s day,' close friend Scott Fryer told the station. 'The look on his face . was just priceless, I was so happy for him.. So this is a real tough . thing.'","Justin Ayers, 33, had a baby girl on Sunday, which was Father's Day .

"By . Damien Gayle . 'Dog killer': Baltimore police officer Jeffrey Bulger, 49, was booked Wednesday on charges after slitting the throat of a dog in police custody . A policeman cut the throat of a dog that bit a woman despite a colleague having it under control, police said. Baltimore Police Officer Jeffrey Bolger has been charged with animal cruelty, with officials saying there was no reason to kill the dog if it was already restrained. The alleged attack happened on Saturday morning in Brewers Hill, a south-eastern district of the city, after police responded to a report of a woman being bitten. Deputy Commissioner Dean Palmere said officers gained control of the animal, a seven-year-old Chinese Shar-Pei, with a dog pole and an officer used a knife to cut the dog's throat. Late last night, Detective Jeremy Silbert issued a statement identifying that policeman as Bolger. Announcing that internal affairs were investigating the killing, Mr Palmere called the incident 'outrageous and unacceptable'. Witnesses told police that as Bolger got out of his vehicle, he said: 'I'm going to f****** gut this thing.' He waited until colleagues got control of the dog before bending down and slashing its throat with a knife, witnesses said. It bled to death before animal control arrived, police told the Baltimore Sun. The dog was initially thought to be a stray, but later was determined to have escaped from its home. Its owner says her pet, called Nala, was not vicious but just lost and scared. 'I never thought in a million years the police would show up and cut my dog’s throat,' Sarah Gossard told CBS Baltimore. Miss Gossard had posted pictures of Nala online after the dog had gone missing. It is understood that the woman who was bitten had been trying to read the dogs tags, which were engraved with an address and phone number. 'She went missing Saturday and after looking for her all day, I found out through a neighbour that she was put down,' Miss Gossard told CNN. 'Police never contacted me until today. Only after did I find out more details. I learned from the news that she was stabbed in the throat. I want justice.' Shar-Pei's are a fighting breed originally used as palace guards in China. The protective and loyal dogs take well to training and are easily socialised but can be stubborn. Largely silent, they only bark when playing or worried. Bolger, who has been on the force since 1992, has been suspended without pay. Police are investigating why Bolger's colleagues didn't report the incident until Monday - two days later. Deputy Commissioner Jerry Rodriguez told a news conference: 'We have no words to describe this. To say that we’re appalled at the allegations I think is an understatement.' Mr Palemere told reporters: 'This is an outrageous and unacceptable breach of our protocol. The BPD does not condone and will not condone such actions.'","Baltimore Police Officer Jeffrey Bolger has been charged with animal cruelty .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . It could be Britain’s first billion-pound divorce – if the combatants can agree on their respective wealth. Financier Sir Chris Hohn is one of Britain’s top philanthropists, having handed more than £1billion to children’s charities. But his American wife, Jamie Cooper-Hohn, claims he is not being as generous when it comes to her settlement. Financier Sir Chris Hohn (left) is one of Britain’s top philanthropists but his wife Jamie Cooper-Hohn (right) says he is not being generous enough when it comes to her settlement . Sir Chris, 47, says Mrs Cooper-Hohn, 49, is entitled to just 25 per cent of a family fortune. She is asking for an equal split. The couple married in 1985 and had four children, including triplets, before she petitioned for divorce in March 2012. A . battle has broken out over the value of The Children’s Investment Fund . (TCI), which he founded, with the Surrey-born billionaire threatening to . walk away and leave it effectively worthless. A grab from the website of The Children's Investment Fund Foundation, a charity the estranged couple both support . Sir . Chris puts a value of only £64million on the company’s net assets, . while his wife claims his shares are worth more than £872million. Yesterday Mrs Cooper-Hohn lost her bid to produce expert evidence about . the value of his hedge fund management companies. Earlier . this year, a High Court judge said the proposed evidence was . speculative and of no material value in the consideration of her . financial claim against Sir Chris. Mrs Cooper-Hohn’s counsel, Martin . Pointer QC, told the Court of Appeal it was necessary to have an . independent assessment of the TCI Group entities for the purpose of . resolving the financial dispute at a trial due to start on June 30. Forbes listed Sir Chris as one of the world's highest-earning hedge fund managers and traders last year, estimating his annual earnings at around £225million. The Surrey-born hedge fund manager set up the Children's Investment Fund (TCI) in 2003 with most of the company's huge profits being channelled to the foundation managed by his wife, who he met at Harvard University. It is estimated the charity made around £1.2billion out of the arrangement, including around £800million in 2007 and 2008, which made Sir Chris one of Britain's most generous men. He came to public attention last year when it emerged his investment fund had snapped up five per cent of shares in Royal Mail. The revelation increased pressure on ministers at the time over whether the firm was undervalued before its sale. Mr Hohn was once described as a ‘locust’ after helping to remove the boss of Deutsche Börse, a German firm that was trying to buy the London Stock Exchange. The couple married in 1985 and had four children, including triplets, before she petitioned for divorce in March 2012 . Mr Hohn, pictured centre, became one of the UK's leading philanthropists after giving an estimated £800m to children's charities since 2003 . He . said the judge had erroneously adopted the husband’s valuation, . accepting without question that the business was wholly dependent upon . him and he was never going to sell it. ‘The . notion that the husband is really the only person who matters for the . purposes of valuing the business is over-stating it,’ Mr Pointer said. The Children’s Investment Fund Foundation (CIFF) aims to improve the lives of children in developing countries, mainly India and Africa, by achieving. A statement on the company's website says: 'We believe that every child deserves to survive, thrive and mature into adulthood in a supportive and safe environment'. The key areas the charity focuses on are neonatal survival, prevention of mother-to-child HIV transmission, education, combating malnutrition, deworming and climate change. Earlier this month CIFF announced it is investing £14.6million in HPV vaccination, which offers the best protection against cervical cancer for women living in developing countries. Both Sir Chris Hohn and Mrs Cooper-Hohn are listed as trustees of the Children's Investment Fund Foundation. He added that it was not credible that Sir Chris would just walk away . from the business: ‘He has generated wealth of $5.7billion . (£3.3billion). 'It is not in his character simply to walk away if there . is significant value in the hedge fund management companies that he . could realise.’ For Sir Chris, Lewis Marks QC said the judge was entitled to reach the opinion that the evidence was not necessary. ‘The . evidence before him was that the husband was the sole decision-maker in . this enterprise, makes all the investment decisions and is the . regulated person as far as the Financial Services Authority is . concerned. 'Without him, there is no business.’ Dismissing Mrs . Cooper-Hohn’s appeal, Lord Justice Ryder said the expert report could be . only hypothetical and would be neither relevant nor necessary. The . court heard that the couple’s assets comprised of investments in TCI of . £680million, the disputed TCI entities, other investments (£17million), . pensions (£50million) and properties (£21million).","Chris Hohn's hedge fund used to give chunk of profits to foundation .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A Florida teen is fighting for her life after she was stabbed multiple times by a registered sex offender during a police chase. Ashley Lyon, 16, from Valrico, went missing Friday, with her parents believing she was lured away by 41-year-old Steven Patrick Myers, who has twice been convicted of child molestation. The pair were spotted at the Tiger Truck Stop near Grosse Tete, Louisiana, at about midnight Wednesday by a patron who recognized them from an Amber Alert. Critical: Ashley Lyon, 16, right, from Valrico, went missing Friday, with her parents believing she was lured away by 41-year-old Steven Patrick Myers, left, who has twice been convicted of child molestation . The patron called the Iberville Sheriff's deputies who arrived to find Lyon and Myers in a Chevy 3500 flatbed pickup truck. When Myers, who was driving, spotted the deputies he fled in the truck and a high speed chase ensued that stretched more than 40 miles to Lafayette, authorities said. Myers rammed four other cars during the chase, in what appeared to be an attempt to create roadblocks behind him. According to the Tampa Bay Times, stop sticks eventually deflated his tires, however the criminal continued driving until his tires wore down to the rims. Tragic: Lyon, pictured left and right, was found inside the truck with multiple stab wounds and was rushed to a Lafayette hospital . When he finally came to a stop, he got out of the truck with a knife in his hand and started yelling at deputies to shoot him, deputies said. At some point he stabbed himself. A police dog was then set on him and he was arrested. Myers was treated for two self-inflicted stab wounds and bites from the police dog. Lyon was found inside the truck with multiple stab wounds and was rushed to a Lafayette hospital. She was listed in critical condition early Thursday. 'We don't have anything new,' Ashley's uncle Todd Lyon told the newspaper from her parents' home. 'When we get more information and we know Ashley's safe, that will be the time to communicate.' Earlier this week, the teen's family revealed that she had exchanged thousands of text messages with Myers prior to her disappearance.","Ashley Lyon, 16, from Valrico, Florida, went missing Friday .

"By . The Associated Press . An 89-year-old Philadelphia man was ordered held without bail today on a German arrest warrant charging that he aided and abetted in the deaths of 216,000 Jews while he was a guard at the Auschwitz death camp. U.S. authorities arrested retired toolmaker Johann 'Hans' Breyer on Tuesday. He spent the night in custody and appeared frail during a detention hearing in federal court, where he wore an . olive green prison jumpsuit and carrying a cane. Legal . filings unsealed today indicate that the district court in . Weiden, Germany, issued a warrant for Breyer's arrest the day before, . charging him with 158 counts of complicity in the commission of murder. Scroll down for video . Johann 'Hans' Breyer's wife Shirley Breyer speaks to reporters outside her home in Philadelphia after her husband's arrest on Wednesday over his alleged role at Auschwitz during the Second World War . Suspected Nazi prison guard Johann 'Hans' Breyer, lives at this Philadelphia home, pictured center, along with his wife. He moved to the U.S. in the 1950s . Each . count represents a trainload of Nazi prisoners from Hungary, Germany . and Czechoslovakia who were killed at Auschwitz-Birkenau between May . 1944 and October 1944, the documents said. Breyer was born in 1925 in what was then . Czechoslovakia to an ethnic German father and an American mother, . Katharina, who was born in Philadelphia. Slovakia became a separate . state in 1939 under the influence of Nazi Germany. In 1942, the Waffen . SS embarked on a drive to recruit ethnic Germans there and Breyer . joined at age 17. The fact he was a minor at the time was critical in . the 2003 decision to allow him to stay in the United States. In . 1951, American military authorities in Germany carried out a background . check on Breyer when he first applied for a visa to the U.S. The file from that investigation lists . him as being with a SS Totenkopf, or 'Death's Head', battalion in . Auschwitz as late as Dec. 29, 1944, four months after he said he . deserted. Breyer has admitted . he was a guard at Auschwitz in occupied Poland during World War II, but . has told The Associated Press he was stationed outside of the . Auschwitz-Birkenau death camp part of the complex and had nothing to do . with the wholesale slaughter of about 1.5 million Jews and others behind . the gates. In a 2012 AP interview at his . modest row house in northeastern Philadelphia, Breyer acknowledged  that . he was in the Waffen SS at Auschwitz but that he never served at the . part of the camp responsible for the extermination of Jews. During the interview, Breyer said he had recently suffered three 'mini-strokes', but he was cogent and clear as he talked about his past for more than an hour. 'I . didn't kill anybody, I didn't rape anybody, and I don't even have a . traffic ticket here,' he said. 'I didn't do anything wrong.' He . said he was aware of what was going on inside the death camp, but did . not witness it himself. 'We could only see the outside, the gates,' he . said. This photo from January 1945 shows Jews at the Auschwitz concentration camp in Poland, where Johann Breyer is said to have been a guard . Following his arrest, Breyer's attorney . Dennis Boyle argued his client is now too infirm to be detained pending a . hearing on his possible extradition to Germany. Breyer has mild dementia . and heart issues and has previously suffered strokes, Boyle said. More...

Laid to rest in the street: The haunting images of Italy's soldiers on the front line during the First World War . 'Mr. Breyer is not a threat to anyone,' said Boyle. 'He's not a flight risk.' But . Magistrate Judge Timothy Rice ruled the detention center was equipped to . care for Breyer, who appeared to comprehend questions about the nature . of the hearing. A law enforcement officer also . testified Breyer and his elderly wife grasped what was happening during . his arrest on Tuesday outside their home in northeast Philadelphia. 'They both understood,' deputy marshal Daniel Donnelly said. 'It wasn't news to them.' Breyer has been under investigation by prosecutors in the Bavarian town of Weiden, near where he last lived in Germany. This image obtained from the National Archives shows a U.S. Army intelligence card on Johann 'Hans' Breyer, indicating he served in Auschwitz as of Dec 29, 1944, four months after he says he deserted . This document provided by the U.S. Department of Justice shows a copy of a World War 2-era record of Breyer's employment as an Auschwitz camp guard in Birkenau . The Army Investigative Records Repository file, obtained by the AP from the National Archives through a Freedom of Information Act request, is significant because judges in 2003 said Breyer's testimony on desertion was part of what convinced them that his service with the Waffen SS after turning 18 might not have been voluntary, further mitigating his wartime responsibility. Breyer testified in U.S. court that he served as a perimeter guard at Auschwitz I, which was largely for prisoners used as slave laborers, though it also had a makeshift gas chamber used early in the war; it was also the camp where SS doctor Josef Mengele carried out sadistic experiments on inmates. But he denied ever serving in Auschwitz II, better known as Auschwitz-Birkenau, the death camp area where the bulk of the people were killed. He also said he deserted in August, 1944 and never returned to the camp, though eventually rejoined his unit fighting outside Berlin in the final weeks of the war. Also weighing in Breyer's favor with the judges was his testimony that he refused to have the SS tattoo; he does not have such a mark today or evidence that one was removed. This undated file image shows the main gate of the Nazi concentration camp Auschwitz I Poland, which was liberated by the Russians in January 1945 . Thomas Walther, a former federal prosecutor with the specia loffice that investigates Nazi war crimes in Germany, now represents family members of some of Breyer's alleged victims as co-plaintiffs in the case. He called for a speedy extradition. 'The German court has to find late justice for the crimes of Breyer and for the victims and their sons and daughters as co-plaintiffs,' Walther wrote in an email to the AP. 'It is late, but not too late.' Prosecutors in Weiden could not be reached for comment on Wednesday. Their investigation comes after years of failed U.S. efforts to have Breyer stripped of his American citizenship and deported. A court ruling in 2003 allowed him to stay in the United States, mainly on the grounds that he had joined the SS as a minor and could therefore not be held legally responsible for participation in it. His American citizenship stems from the fact his mother was born in the U.S.; she later moved to Europe, where Breyer was born. Victims of the Auschwitz death camp stand on the platform at Birkenau Station during World War 2 . During . Breyer's arrest on Tuesday, he asked the marshals to retrieve papers in . his home that document his right to stay in the U.S., Donnelly . testified.

"By . Corey Charlton . Doctor Zyad Younan claims he was drugged during his visits to the strip club but the company is refusing to drop its claim for his $135,000 bill . A strip club is continuing its lawsuit against a wealthy doctor to try and settle his massive $135,000 bill, despite police claims he was the victim of a gang of strippers who drugged and scammed at least $200,000 from their victims. Police recently arrested a crew of New York City strippers who they say were spiking wealthy men's drinks before dragging them to strip clubs to rack up enormous charges on their credit cards. Now a strip club at the centre of the offending is refusing to drop its lawsuit against Dr. Zyad Younan for a massive bill he incurred. The New York Post reported the strip club Scores' attorney Alison Blaine as saying Dr. Younan's big spending was voluntary. 'He was at the club three times. He was drugged three times?,' she said. Drug . Enforcement Administration and New York Police Department investigators . recently arrested four women: Samantha Barbash, Roselyn Keo, Karina Pacsucci and . Marsi Rosen, on charges including grand larceny, assault and forgery in . relation to the scam. Dr Younan is just one of four victims, which also includes a banker, a lawyer and a real estate attorney, to be plied with ecstasy, cocaine and prescription drugs and then taken to Scores in Manhattan and the RoadHouse NYC Gentleman’s Club in Queens. Once there the women would whisk the intoxicated men away for private dances and then take away their credit cards while they were too wasted to stop it. Busted: Samantha Barbash, is escorted by law enforcement officers following her arrest in New York. Barbash is allegedly part of a crew of New York City strippers who scammed wealthy men by drugging them and running up extravagant bills at topless clubs while they were in a daze . Charged: Karina Pascucci arrives in court on Tuesday night after being charged in connection with a scam involving exotic dancers in New York City . Carmine Vitolo, a manager at the Roadhouse was also charged with conspiracy, grand larceny and tampering with physical evidence. According to court papers, the strippers would prowl bars in Manhattan and Long Island for their victims over a four month period beginning in September 2013. The roundup followed an undercover investigation that found that the women joined in a scheme to rip off the men by drugging them with Molly, a powerful powder form of ecstasy after arranging to meet them on 'dates'. According to court papers, Samantha Barbash was the ring-leader along with Roselyn Keo. Barbash’s attorney, Stephen Murphy, has said his client denies the charges. Ruthless: Samantha Barbash is allegedly the leader of a gang of strippers who have stolen hundreds of thousands of dollars from wealthy male clients in New York City . Destination: This is Scores gentlemen's club in Manhattan - one of the destination for the women after they allegedly drugged their victims . Once they had given their victims the drugs the women then took the men to the clubs and brought the inebriated men to private rooms for dances and then stole their cards and racked up huge charges. The strippers falsely authorized tens of thousands of dollars to the victims' cards by forging their signatures and making them believe they were being charged for a lower amount. 'These individuals targeted and isolated victims in order to illegally obtain access to their credit cards and thousands of dollars of credit,' said Police Commissioner Bill Bratton. 'Thanks to the hard work of the investigators and prosecutors in this case, these individuals will no longer be in a position to profit from this type of fraudulent activity.' Also charged: Marsi Rosen is also charged with being part of a crime ring of strippers who have allegedly stolen at least $200,000 from wealthy New York City men . Exotic: This is the RoadHouse Gentlemen's Club in Queens - another favorite destination of the strippers . Indeed, in some cases the strippers took photos and videoed the men in compromising sexual positions with women and men and threatened to blackmail them. The three other unidentified victims were all allegedly conned for a total of $55,000. Special .

"By . Lydia Warren . Locked up: Ricky R. Weeden has been sentenced to five years behind bars for a 2012 hit-and-run . A man who has been arrested 150 times for driving violations has been sentenced to just five years in prison for a hit-and-run that killed a four-year-old boy. Ricky R. Weeden Sr., 56, whose arrests include drunken driving, speeding, reckless driving and driving without a license since his was revoked in 1993, struck a plea deal in St Louis County, Missouri on Friday for his most recent charges - involuntary manslaughter and fleeing the scene of a fatal crash. Weeden, who killed two other young people in a previous car crash in 1983, will receive credit for his 20 months already served. The sentence relates to an October 2012 crash, when he hit and killed Traye-shon Williams and injured his brother Jay'Shard Conner, then 10, as they crossed the street in Pagedale. After Weeden knocked them down in his GMC Sierra pickup, he drove off, leaving the younger boy to die at the scene. Jay'Shared suffered leg injuries. Police later found Weeden's truck and tied it to the crime, and he was charged three days later. He was initially charged with second-degree murder and assault, but prosecutors said there were problems building a case against him because one witness refused to testify and another had edibility problems because of a criminal history, the St Louis Post-Dispatch reported. Authorities said there was also no evidence that Weeden was drunk at the time, and that wet road could have played a role in the crash. Loss: Traye-shon Williams, pictured with his mother Felicia, died at the scene after he was hit by the car . But the boys' mother, Felicia Williams, responded on Tuesday: 'Someone is laying in the cemetery dead and they will never get up and come home again. That's enough evidence right there.' Weeden's record includes at least 11 DWI arrests, including six that resulted in convictions. In 1983, he ran a red light in St. Louis . and hit another vehicle, killing Avance Wilson, 23, and Doris Ann Jones, . 20, and injuring two others. St. Louis police sought charges of manslaughter, assault and careless and imprudent driving against Weeden in the case - but he was only charged with careless and imprudent driving and was freed on $50 bail. His license was revoked in April 1993 after he refused to take a breath test during a traffic stop and he never got it back, records show. Missed: His mother said the five-year sentence was not enough seeing as he had been a serial offender . Despite this long rap sheet, he served fewer than two years in prison for his DWIs - an example of how offenders avoid tough penalties after deals made in municipal courts, the Post-Dispatch reported. Williams, 32, said she believed the sentence was too lenient, especially considering his history. 'It's not just my baby,' she said. 'It's two other bodies.' She demanded to know why his sentence wasn't harsher. 'Why is he so privileged?' she asked. 'To just receive five years, and you’ve been doing this since the ’80s, is crazy.'","Ricky R.

Actor Michael Jace appears in court in Los Angeles today where he pleaded not guilty to shooting his wife April dead at their home last month in front of their two young sons . Jace's attorney Jason Sias said that his client might seek a reduction of his bail at a future hearing.

"By . Darren Boyle . The mystery man who took almost 500 selfies over a 30 year period has been identified as photobooth technician Franklyn Swantek. Mr Swantek was owner of Swantek Photo Service which described itself as 'Michigan's largest operators and distributors of Photomatic'. The 455 images form part of a exhibition at Rutgers University's Zimmerli Art Gallery in New Brunswick, New Jersey. Franklyn Swantek took the 455 images over a 30 year period between the 1930s to 1960s . Mr Swantek, right, was identified by his nephew Tom Trelenberg who spotted a story about the mystery man on the internet . Curators at the gallery were unaware of Mr Swantek's identity until his nephew Tom Trelenberg from Minden, Nevada logged on to the internet and saw a story about the mysterious man. Scrolling through the images, Mr Trelenberg said: 'Wow, that looks a lot like Uncle Franklyn.' As he read through the article, which speculated that the man may have been a photobooth technician, adding, 'I knew it was him.' According to Mr Trelenberg, he would regularly visit his uncle's home in New Boston, Michigan during the summer. 'Uncle Franklyn was a lot of fun, just a cheerful guy. It’s why I kept going back. I remember helping him tear apart Photomatics that weren’t being used anymore. As payment, he let me keep whatever I found in the coin box.' Mr Trelenberg said his uncle was the co-owner of a plane as well as an avid fisherman who owned a cabin. He said: 'There are a lot of great family stories about Uncle Franklyn.' His uncle even visited Mr Trelenberg's home in Nevada until his death in in the mid 1980s, even visiting a casino. 'We’d walk down the street, and Uncle Franklyn would pull out a coin, run up to a door and try to shove it in the keyhole. 'Then, he’d turn to us and say, ""Sorry, I thought it was another of those slot machines!""' Donna Gustafson of Zimmerli gallery said: 'Now . that the man has a name, the 445 portraits have gone from an essay on . passing time focused on a single face to a real person with a . biography. 'The story comes full circle and returns the . photographs in a strange and beautiful way to the family.' Her colleague Susan Sidlauskas of the Rutgers Department of Art History  added: 'Knowing that this man was ‘the fun . uncle’ allows us to see these hundreds of images less as a curiosity . than as evidence of one man’s ability to perform multiple selves, and in . so doing reach across time. 'There’s a twinkle in his . eye that suggests that he had a reason for holding on to all those . photos.' Mr Trelenberg said he particularly enjoyed visiting his uncle's house in New Boston, Michigan while he was growing up . Franklyn Swantek, photographed along with is family, left, is featured in the exhibition at Rutgers University, right, called '455 Portraits of Man', his story is also being told in a forthcoming book American Photobooth . Franklyn Swantek, right, photographed with two children . The photographs were bought by Donald Lokuta said he believed Mr Swantek knew exaclty what he was doing by keeping the images. 'He was making a record of his life,' he said. Mr Swantek's story is now being written by author Näkki Goranin in American Potobooth. Most of the pictures show Mr Swantek grinning at the camera in the photobooth while others show him almost scowling as his mood changes. In some of the pictures he is seen sporting a fedora and smoking a pipe, while other times he is dressed in a suit. The pictures are now being shared in an exhibition at Rutgers University in New Jersey in an appropriately named show called '445 Portraits of Man'. Mr Lokuta told Rutgers: 'As a historian, I knew this was very rare, but on a deeper level, I wondered, ""Why would somebody want to take almost 500 photos of himself in a photobooth?""' 'There’s quite an age difference in the photos: You see him as younger man and then with a white, receding hairline and wrinkles.' Mr Swantek, left, ran Michigan's largest Phototomatic business and took the images of himself to test that the machines he had installed had been working correctly .

"By . Snejana Farberov . and Associated  Press Reporter . Baby-faced killer: Aza Ray Vidinhar, 16, has pleaded guilty to two counts of murder, admitting that he intentionally and knowingly stabbed his two younger brothers to death last spring . A 16-year-old boy from Utah has pleaded guilty to two counts of murder, admitting that he intentionally and knowingly stabbed his two younger brothers to death last year. Aza Ray Vidinhar agreed to a deal Wednesday in a court in Farmington that calls for him to serve time for one count of murder in juvenile detention until he turns 21. After that, he'll be transferred into the adult court system to serve time for the second count of murder on a sentence that could be as long as life or as short as a few months. Vidinhar was calm, stoic and spoke in a deep voice during consecutive court hearings in juvenile and adult court where judges made sure he understood the conditions of the agreement. The teenager did not say anything beyond responding to the judge's questions. But his attorney, Todd Utzinger, said Vidinhar is sorry for what happened and took the deal in part to spare his parents from having to endure a trial. His parents were present at both hearings, but they left the court without talking to reporters.  His father wiped tears from his eyes while his mother sat in silence. Utzinger called it a somber day despite a deal that both the defense and prosecution, as well as the parents, agree is fair. 'They are in an impossible situation,' Utzinger said about the parents. 'They are trying to balance their love for Aza and their other children and how to handle an event of this magnitude. They just want an opportunity to move on privately with their lives.' Innocents: Alex Vidinhar, 10 (left), and his 4-year-old brother, Benjie (right), were stabbed by their then-15-year-old brother, Aza, while their parents were away . Shocking crime: This May 23, 2013, file photo shows medical examiner officials removing the body of one of the slain Vidinhar brothers from their home in West Point, Utah . Family tragedy: The murdered children's mother returned home and found her sons stabbed to death while in the care of their older brother . The murder case sent shockwaves last spring through the middle-class subdivision where the family lives in West Point, a city of 9,800 about 25 miles north of Salt Lake City. Vidinhar's adopted younger brothers, Alex, 10, and Benjie, 4, were found dead in May 2013 when his mother returned home from taking another sibling to a dance recital. At first, Aza was thought to be a third victim because he was missing from home, but police found him hours later spattered with blood. Authorities said they believed the stabbings were an unplanned attack. Utzinger declined to discuss what Vidinhar said about what happened that night. He also declined to discuss if Vidinhar has any mental illness. In signing off on the deal, juvenile court Judge Janice Frost said the agreement adequately balances public safety needs while giving Vidinhar access to treatment and rehabilitation services in juvenile court that he needs. Frost implored Vidinhar to take advantage of treatment he'll receive in juvenile detention and the opportunity to finish his high school degree. She said it's clear that he needs guidance and direction he would not receive in adult prison. Justice: Aza Ray Vidinhar, pictured shackled in court, will serve time for the murders in both juvenile detention and adult prison . Frost told him multiple times that how he behaves in juvenile detention will impact how long he spends in state adult prison. 'You can't make up for what happened. But you can commit to doing better and being better,' Frost said. 'It's a sad thing that happened, but you can move forward from this. I hope you can take advantage of your opportunity.' In their joint obituary, Alex was described as an outgoing and friendly boy who loved meeting new people and singing; his younger brother, Benjie, had a passion for trucks and hot wheels, but was the more reserved of the two. On May 22, 2013, the two kids were left in the care of their older brother while their mother took her daughters to a dance recital, Desert News reported at the time. The woman returned home in the afternoon with her three girls and discovered the body of 4-year-old Benjie. She called 911, thinking that Alex and Aza Ray were missing, but police officers who arrived on the scene found the 10-year-old dead in another part of the house. The teenager did not say anything in court, but his attorney, Todd Utzinger (center), said Vidinhar is sorry for what happened . At around 11.35pm that night, officers tracked down Aza Ray Vidinhar, who was arrested at once in connection to his brothers’ stabbing deaths. At the time, police said they had a motive for the crime but would not elaborate on it. ‘We never imagined something like this could happen,’ the boys' father told KSL. ‘I understand that there must be justice, but life without parole would be way too harsh for a 15-year-old with no previous criminal history.’ At the time of the slayings, the father was on active military duty in Alabama. Neighbors described Aza Ray as a quiet teenager who excelled in his studies. Local school officials confirmed that the ninth-grader was an honor student at West Point Junior High School. Aza Ray made headlines in 2011 when he ran away from home, sparking a massive search. He was eventually found sitting in a Wendy’s restaurant four miles from home. Figure of maturity: Second District Judge David Hamilton speaks during Aza Ray Vidinhar's  plea deal during at the Davis Justice Complex in Farmington . Outside court Wednesday, his attorney, Todd Utzinger, said sending Vidinhar first to juvenile detention gives him a real chance at rehabbing. 'It would be inhumane for any 16-year-old child to go straight to the prison without first having an opportunity for treatment and rehabilitation,' Utzinger said. 'That's what we're trying to accomplish.' Once Vidinhar is transferred to adult state prison, his attorneys plan to ask the parole board to immediately review the case and assess his behavior in juvenile detention to decide how much longer he'll serve in adult prison. The plea deal calls for a sentence of up to life, but the parole board could go to the opposite extreme and give him credit for time served and let him out immediately, Utzinger said. If Vidinhar doesn't do well in juvenile detention, he could serve many years in state prison. 'If he isn't rehabilitated by 21, the state wanted the safety valve of having him go to prison to see how he does there,' Utzinger said.","Aza Ray Vidinhar, 16, will serve time in juvenile detention until age 21 and will then be transferred into adult court system .

Manatees are protected by the Florida Manatee Sanctuary Act, which makes it illegal to injure, harm, capture or attempt to capture a manatee in Florida. The enormous, friendly mammals are also called sea cows. As Florida's inlets and coastal canals have become more populated with power boats, manatees - which often swim near the surface of the water - have been the unintended victims of countless run-ins with propellers of power boats, which has led to their inclusion on the endangered species list.","Blake Martin and Seth Andrew Stephenson were caught after they posted a video of their stunt on the Internet .

"By . Sean Poulter . British tourists are turning their backs on Kenya because of the threat of terrorism. Militants linked to Al Qaeda carried out two massacres in villages close to a holiday island this week, claiming more than 60 lives. Terror group Al Shabab, which has carried out a series of recent bomb attacks, warned: ‘Kenya is now officially a war zone and any tourists visiting the country do so at their own peril.’ Scroll down for video . Residents barricade a road as they protest against the recent killings in the village of Kibaoni. Militants linked to Al Qaeda have carried out two massacres in the area - claiming 60 lives . A man observes the remains of destroyed vehicles and buildings in the town of Mpeketoni after the area was attacked by extremists this week. Terror group Al Shabaab have warned tourists they visit the country 'at their own peril' Some tour operators, including Thomson, stopped sending travellers to Kenya in May after the first of the bombings. In a normal year, more than 180,000 Britons would travel to the East African country for its beaches, safaris and wildlife. But visitor numbers have plummeted – with up to 80 per cent of hotel rooms reportedly empty in Mombasa, the country’s second-largest city after the capital, Nairobi. Kenya’s tourist board in London has tried to play down the threats. It confirmed that gunmen had raided Majembeni village, a rural farming community about ten miles from Kenya’s coast and 40 miles south of Mokowe, where many holidaymakers take a boat to Lamu, a popular tourist spot. But a spokesman said: ‘Majembeni village has no international tourist facilities and no tourists were involved in the incident. ‘Lamu Island, one of Kenya’s primary tourist resorts, is in no way affected by this attack and neither is any other part of the Kenya coast. The majority of visitors travelling to Lamu arrive by air into the local airport.’ Kenyan police officers patrol Mavuno villages near Mpeketoni after unidentified gunmen attacked the coastal Kenyan town. Hotels are believed to be 80 per cent empty in Mombasa, the country's second city . Somali group Al Shabab confirmed it had carried out the latest attack, telling Reuters that its ‘operations in Kenya will continue’ in response to the presence of Kenyan troops in Somalia and the killing of Muslims. Spokesman Sheikh Abdiasis Abu Musab said it had raided villages around Mpeketoni, and he claimed most of those who were killed while watching a World Cup match in a hotel were police officers and wildlife wardens. Thomson said all outbound flights up to October 31 have been cancelled and anyone with a booking should contact the company. Kenya police observe the remains of burnt-out cars at a police station in Mpeketoni.  Kenya's tourist board in London has attempted to play down the threats in a bid to save the tourism industy . A spokesman added: ‘Customers will be able to amend their booking to an alternative holiday, any on sale season for either long haul or short haul destinations, as long as the holiday is booked by the end of June. ‘If the cost is less than their original holiday, they will be refunded the difference. ‘If it’s more expensive we will pay £50 per person towards the extra cost as a gesture of goodwill. ‘If we are unable to secure an alternative holiday, then a full refund will be offered.’ A spokesman for rival operator Thomas Cook said: ‘We monitor travel advice closely and are contacting the small number of customers with forward bookings to the affected areas that are travelling over the next few weeks to discuss their options. We will liaise with our experienced overseas team and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and update on changes in advice.’","80 per cent of hotel rooms reportedly empty in Mombasa, Kenya .

She said that her frail mother was left lying on the road unable to move or have a drink on the advice of the emergency call operator. Her daughter and carer, 64, also of Farndon, said it was disgraceful. 'I just thought it was horrendous,' she said. 'It was a very hot day. She was lying in the road on the gravel. She couldn’t move and she couldn’t have water. 'We explained she was 94 but were told the call was not a priority. I couldn’t believe it when we were told it wasn’t urgent. It was horrific.' Mrs Rogers, who is recovering well, said: 'The pavement was on a slope and I just went over. 'I remember banging my head and there was blood everywhere. ”It was so hot in the road just lying there.

"By . Sam Webb . The owner of a Staffordshire Bull Terrier that ripped the head off another dog has been jailed. David Savage, 45, was sentenced to four weeks in prison after he was spotted walking a different dog - in breach of a 10-year ban. He was given a suspended sentence in August after his Staffordshire Bull Terrier George decapitated tiny Pomeranian Elvis in what was described as a ‘horrific’ attack in Warrington, Cheshire. Savage was arrested by officers on Sunday walking another dog - described as larger than his previous one - and jailed for four weeks at Halton Magistrates Court on Monday for breaching his suspended sentence. David Savage, 45, was sentenced to four weeks in prison after he was spotted walking a dog in breach of a 10-year ban. His Staffordshire Bull Terrier George decapitated Elvis (right), a tiny Pomeranian,  last year . Mauling: Susan Campbell is seen dragging the Staffordshire Bull Terrier, called George, away after it had mauled Gemma Antell's Pomeranian dog Elvis in Warrington, Cheshire . Last year he admitted being in charge of dog dangerously out of control in a public place, and the court heard he had a conviction for the same offence in 2006. Susan Campbell, who was walking the dog, called George, at the time, received a five-year banning order. The dog was destroyed. The owners of the savaged pup Elvis said they were disgusted to hear Savage had been spotted walking another dog. They were also furious that the animal has been allowed to remain at the house where Campbell and Savage live because they have claimed a third person owns it. Mother-of-three Gemma Antell said: 'For an even bigger dog to be allowed to stay in that environment is like a timebomb. 'We’re pleased the court has taken this seriously but our main priority is that dog is still in that house because of a ridiculous loophole. Elvis' owners Gemma and Steven Antell. She said: 'I'm so scared of walking the dog now and feel nervous all the time' 'It’s not fair on the dog and it should be removed and given to a loving home. If it’s brought up in the same environment then the same thing will happen again but next time it could be a child.' The family were tipped off by friends in the Latchford area Savage had been seen with another dog and immediately contacted the police. Mrs Antell, who has since replaced Elvis with a cross Pomeranian and chihuahua called Presley, added: 'I’m so scared of walking the dog now and feel nervous all the time. 'I really don’t want to see another victim of a dog attack and if they’re spotted again walking a dog we’re just going to keep ringing the police until they get the message. Adorable: Elvis as was described as 'friendly, attention seeking and harmless' 'I feel like people and pets aren’t safe because they are not responsible for a dog and I’ve experienced the worst possible outcome.' A picture of the dog that died, a Pomeranian pup called Elvis, covered in blood went viral after the incident in August last year. At the time Elvis was playing in a garden in Latchford, Warrington, when he barked at another dog walking past. George burst through the gate, snatching Elvis in its jaws and ripping his head off. Witnesses say the dog then spat out Elvis’ head after being pulled away by its owner. Mrs Antell, 30, described Elvis as ‘friendly, attention seeking and harmless’. He was being looked after by mother-in-law Margaret Antell on Saturday while Gemma celebrated son Lincoln’s sixth birthday. She added: 'It was like something out of a horror film, like it’s not actually happened. My children are distraught. 'It is the first thing they have had to lose and it’s completely changed the way they see dogs as they are now terrified, which is very sad. 'Elvis would never hurt anyone. The kids have grown up around him and he hardly had any teeth because with his breed, they fall out. 'Everyone loved him and we couldn’t walk down the street because people would want to stop and stroke him. 'I am still in shock.

Former England international Ian Wright is understood to have flown home from Brazil after his wife and children were burgled at knifepoint. It is understood four men armed with knives made their way into his north-west London home and held his wife and children before making off with personal possessions. The 50-year-old pundit, who has been working for ITV at the World Cup, tweeted on Wednesday night: 'You won't get away with it.' Home: Ian Wright is understood to have left Brazil after his wife and children were burgled at knifepoint . A Scotland Yard spokesman said: 'We are investigating an aggravated burglary at an address in north-west London after we were called at 9.20 last night. 'Personal possessions were stolen. The suspects are described as four black men aged between 18 and 25, with London accents, wearing dark clothing and hoodies obscuring their faces.' The Sun reported that the former Arsenal striker dashed back from the World Cup after learning the gang had held a blade to his wife Nancy's throat. Wright's manager Steve Kutner told the newspaper: 'It was a terrifying ordeal. They marched Ian's wife from room to room. 'I would like to thank ITV for helping Ian to get home as quickly as possible.' Nancy, 39, is thought to have been put in a bedroom while the couple's two girls were taken to another room. ITV later confirmed that Wright had left Brazil and would be replaced on Thursday night's broadcast by Gus Poyet. 'Ian travelled home immediately to be with his family on hearing this shocking news.

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . Former Business Secretary Lord Mandelson defended Tony Blair against criticism over Iraq, insisting it was a 'mistake honestly made' The Iraq war was a ‘mistake honestly made’, Lord Mandelson claimed last night as he leapt to the defence of his old friend Tony Blair. The former Labour Cabinet minister insisted Mr Blair had not ‘gone a bit nuts’ for calling for new military action and did not take the ‘country to war on a lie’. Lord Mandelson said he was not going to ‘join Tony Blair's chorus of critics’, after the former Prime Minister came under fire in recent days for claiming the latest unrest in Iraq was unconnected to the 2003 invasion. Mr Blair has come under fire from across the political spectrum for his call for new military intervention in Iraq. His former deputy Lord Prescott accused him of behaving like the ‘crusades’ while London Mayor Boris Johnson said the former Premier ‘needs professional psychiatric help’. Islamist jihadists are now in control of large areas of the Iraq, plunging the country into its bloodiest crisis since the withdrawal of US troops in 2011. ISIS rebels, led by Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, are threatening to topple the government, with David Cameron warning the group would attempt terror strikes against Britain. But Mr Blair this week claimed Iraq would have been 'engulfed by precisely the same convulsion' if Saddam Hussein had remained in power, as he called for new military intervention. The remarks reignited the bitter row about the basis of his decision to follow George W Bush into the war. Lord Mandelson, a former New Labour spin doctor, refused to criticise the decision to go to war. He told BBC 2’s Newsnight: ‘I think that on reflection you could judge that it was a mistake, but this is the crucial point I would make to you: if it was a mistake, it was a mistake honestly made. ‘I do not believe that either Tony Blair or the government as a whole - as some people claim - took the country to war on a lie. I think that's unacceptable. I don't think it's true.’ The former Labour spin doctor denied Mr Blair had 'gone a bit nuts' after calling for new military intervention in Iraq . Mr Blair has come under renewed criticism for his decision to join US President George W Bush in the 2003 invasion . He also denied Mr Blair had gone too far in defending the 2003 war, and the bloodshed which followed after Saddam Hussein was ousted. Lord Mandelson added: ‘I do not think he's gone a bit nuts and I think he is fully entitled to defend his position. ‘I also happen to think he's right to say that whereas 25 years ago... we had the relative certainties of the Cold War to deal with, we now have the terrible uncertainties of jihadism, of radical Islam. ‘He is right to point out the dangers of that and he's right to galvinise people and mobilise people to take the action, to adopt the policies to deal with it.’ However, not all of Mr Blair's former Cabinet colleagues have been so supportive. His former Foreign Secretary Jack Straw insisted the rise of jihadist extremism in Iraq is linked to the 2003 invasion. He said it was 'impossible' to argue that the war ordered by Mr Blair 'played no part at all in today's events'. It put him at odds with Mr Blair who claimed Iraq would have been 'engulfed by precisely the same convulsion' if Saddam Hussein had remained in power, as he called for new military intervention. Lord Prescott, who served as Deputy Prime Minister at the time of the war, accused Mr Blair of trying to take the West 'back to the crusades'. 'He says he's disappointed with what has happened in Iraq... but he wants to invade somewhere else now,' he told Sky News. 'Your great danger, when you want to go and do these regime changes, you're back to what Bush called a crusade... put on a white sheet and a red cross, and we're back to the crusades.' Clare Short, who also served in Mr Blair's Cabinet during the war, said he had been 'absolutely, consistently wrong, wrong, wrong' on the issue, and branded him a 'complete American neocon'. 'More bombing will not solve it, it will just exacerbate it,' she said.","Ex-Cabinet minister insists Britain was not taken to war on a 'lie'

"By . Kieran Corcoran . Kitten killer: Robert Cashmore, 21, punched five-week old Bobby the kitten, leaving him unable to eat for days while he starved to death . An unemployed cleaner killed a kitten by punching it repeatedly in the face, the leaving it for days to starve to death, a court heard. Robert Cashmore, 21, broke the jaw of the defencless animal, called Bobby, leaving it unable to eat, Birmingham Magistrates court was told. The injury left the five-week old pet unable to eat, leading to its slow, painful starvation, magistrates heard. Cashmore also admitted poking another kitten in the eye while it was in his care last year, magistrates found. The drive cleaner, from Edgbaston in Birmingham, was convicted of two counts of causing unnecessary suffering to the animals. He admitted the charges, accepting that he had failed to find medical help for the animals, but had denied he attacked Bobby. However, magistrates found that he did, in fact, attack the kitten. A woman, Cashmore's former partner Charlotte Coombes, 18, was also convicted of causing unnecessary suffering to Bobby. At the hearing, Cashmore was told by the bench: 'Your evidence was not credible. We find as a matter of fact you did punch him (Bobby) four times. You are guilty of causing unnecessary suffering.' Giving evidence in his defence, Cashmore initially claimed Bobby had been injured after falling on to a pair of hair clippers. Yet in an interview with an RSPCA officer he said he had stepped on Bobby, before finally admitting that he punched the kitten. Killed: RSPCA investigators produced this image of Bobby the kitten after he died . Suffering: Cashmore, left at Birmingham Magistrates' Court, admitted casuing unnecessary suffering to two cats. Charlotte Coombes, 18, a former partner of Cashmore, admitted one count . Asked why he changed his account under cross examination, Cashmore said: 'I only said what I said because I had not been accused of anything like this before. I just wanted to get the RSPCA agent out of my flat. 'I didn’t punch him four times, I only said that because I thought I was doing the right thing by making up a truth.” Five-week old Bobby was found dead in a basket at Cashmore’s flat last August by an RSPCA inspector alerted by an anonymous tip-off. At an earlier hearing Rafe Turner, prosecuting, said the kitten had a festering wound to its lower jaw. 'This kitten had suffered a substantial injury to its jaw and that had caused its demise,” he said. Mr Turner said the kitten would have been left unable to eat because of its injuries and had probably suffered for days before succumbing to starvation. Cashmore and Coombes will be sentenced on July 18.","WARNING GRAPHIC CONTENT .

"By . Sam Webb . Villagers were plagued by rats after they broke free from an overcrowded cage to escape horrific neglect by their owner - who was reportedly breeding them as snake food. Andrew Hughes, 24, of of Hallglen, Falkirk, Scotland, kept almost 200 rodents in the cruelly . cramped conditions of a wooden rabbit hutch that only had enough space . for 32 of the creatures. Most of the animals were pregnant females. The Scottish SPCA was called in when residents of the village of Standburn reported rats swarming around their back doors in October. Sickening: The rats were forced to endure horrendous conditions by owner Andrew Hughes. when they escaped they swarmed through the village of standburn in Scotland . They were then able to trace the source of the animals. It is believed the rats had chewed through  the cage and made their escape. Hughes pleaded guilty to being responsible for 220 domestic rats and failing to provide them with a suitable environment and accommodation, keeping them in a wooden shed which had little light or ventilation. The cage, which was not rat proof to prevent them from escaping, was contaminated by faeces and the rats were forced to swarm all over each other, leading to disease. Hughes used 16 small boxes to keep 50 female rats and their young in overcrowded conditions. He failed to separate the pregnant and weaning female rats from other rats prior to giving birth, so some of the young were consumed by other rats and their mothers. He also failed to prevent uncontrolled breeding and inbreeding. Animal welfare officials today slammed a court for not banning Hughes from keeping animals of any kind  for life. A Scottish SPCA officer said: 'This was a . horrific case of animal neglect. The hutch was swarming with rats and . they were piled up on top of each other due to lack of space. 'It was clear the conditions were woefully inadequate and completely inhumane.' The rats were left to inbreed and newly-born rats were often consumed shortly after birth because females were not separated . Scottish SPCA inspector Leanne McPake said: 'Hughes was keeping 170 rats in a two storey rabbit hutch which was approximately two foot by four foot in size. 'Of the 170 rats, 140 were females and many of them were pregnant. A further 50 mothers and their young were also found in smaller boxes, bringing the total number to 220. 'In times of stress mother rats will harm or destroy their babies and we could see young being eaten by their mothers and other rats.' It is believed that the rats may have been bred for sale to owners of snakes. The court was told Hughes had 'no interest in animals'. Sheriff William Gallacher replied: 'That much is evident.' He was ordered to complete 200 hours of unpaid work in the community, within six months. Hughes refused to comment after the case.","A horde of vermin flooded a Scottish village after escaping vile conditions .

Founders Rolant Tomos (left) and Rob Lilford enjoy some of their own beer. The two men hit it off after going for a coffee and discovering a mutual interest in home brewing . He added: 'We discovered that we had a lot in common, including an interest in home brewing.' The pair hope that their beers will make a dent in the commercial market. 'I’ve always dreamed of owning a brewery, as every sensible young man does, and when I told Rolant about this he said he may be able to help with his experience as a business mentor.' After two years of planning, tasting and pouring pints, the Tomos Lilford Brewery now produces four core ales - Rosemary Ale, Hay Ale, the Personal Best bitter and Trip-hop. The company has been given a boost with £2,000 of grant funding from Creative Rural Communities, a local enterprise scheme. The extra money has allowed the business partners to invest in new tanks and pay an advertising agency to develop their brand - they also recruited Mr Lilford's brother Rob for the team. Their new logo features a cormorant - a large waterbird - and will be officially revealed on Saturday.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Heavy metal rockers Iron Maiden say the Glastonbury Festival has become too ‘middle class’. Bruce Dickinson, the band’s privately-educated lead singer who is also a qualified airline pilot, will not be joining fellow rockers Metallica at the 'bourgeois' event. Instead Dickinson will top the bill at hard rock festival Sonisphere, at Knebworth Park - where Metallica will also appear - the week after Glastonbury. No regrets: Bruce Dickinson said he was glad Iron Maiden was playing a hard rock festival instead of Glastonbury . Dickinson told the Telegraph: ‘In the days when Glasto was an alternative festival it was quite interesting. ‘Now it’s the most bourgeois thing on the planet. Anywhere Gwyneth Paltrow goes and you can live in an air-conditioned yurt is not for me. Dickinson singled out Gwyneth Paltrow for particular criticism, saying anywhere she goes 'is not for me' ‘We’ll leave the middle classes to do Glastonbury and the rest of the great unwashed will decamp to Knebworth and drink lots of beer and have fun.’ When the festival first started in 1970 - the day after Jimi Hendrix died - it was called the Pilton Pop, Blues and Folk Festival, attracted just 1,500 people and charged £1 for a ticket. The Kinks headlined the events, and attractions included free milk from Worthy Farm and an ox roast. In 1971 . the event was free to enter, and prided itself on being less commercial . than other events, taking up the medieval tradition of music, dance, . poetry, theatre, lights and spontaneous entertainment. Attendance . that year shot up to 12,000, with acts included David Bowie playing. It . was also the first year the iconic pyramid stage was built using . scaffolding and tarpaulin. Nowadays tickets cost £210 each, and all 120,000 of them sold out within just one hour and 27 minutes for this year's event. The . campsite, once little more than a muddy field, now boasts VIP areas . with some companies offering luxury tents complete with duvets, pillows, . lighting, toiletries. So-called glampers will also have access to private facilities such as luxury showers, a make-up parlour, restaurant and bar. Other companies offers tipis with Egyptian cotton sheets, rugs, double beds and bamboo towel rails. Festival organisers have spent £600,000 on smell-free ‘super loos’ this year, instead of the much-feared portable toilets of old. Tech-savvy campers will also be able to charge their phones at the event, taking place on Worthy Farm in Somerset next weekend, using charging stations, will have 4G provided by EE and be able to pay with credit cards at the food stalls. The second year Glastonbury was held, in 1971, entrance was free and it prided itself on being unlike other more commercial events. Headliners that year included David Bowie . Nowadays campers can sleep in solar-powered pods, or in a luxury tipi complete with double bed, linen, duvets with access to beauty parlors, 'vanity vans', restaurants and bars .","Privately-educated Bruce Dickinson said Glastonbury is now too posh .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Compulsory: International development minister Lynne Featherstone (pictured) said tackling FGM should be a required part of the curriculum . Lessons on female genital mutilation should be a compulsory part of the school curriculum in areas where the practice is prevalent, a junior minister said. Lynne Featherstone also stressed more support and training was needed for professionals dealing with the issue on the front line. Speaking in the Commons, she said: 'When I went to Burkina Faso, one of the leading countries in Africa in reducing and tackling female genital mutilation, I visited a school to watch an FGM lesson where it is part of the curriculum. 'I do believe it needs to be a required part of the curriculum here in high prevalence areas. 'The Deputy Prime Minister (Nick Clegg) in a recent speech on development made a commitment linked to this and also support to frontline professionals, because we know from the NSPCC helpline that professionals need support and training. 'FGM is violence against women and girls and the UK has made the largest donor commitment ever to end FGM with a flagship programme of £35 million in at least 17 countries. 'The Prime Minister (David Cameron) will host a summit in July that will step up global efforts to end both FGM and child early enforced marriage within a generation.' The international development minister was responding to a question from Cambridge MP Dr Julian Huppert, who asked: 'Do you agree with many of the people who have given evidence to the Home Affairs Select Committee that we should ensure all children in the UK are taught about FGM and the fact it is not allowed? 'And that we should not allow parents to take their children out because the children whose parents would not want them to know would be the children we need to target?' Ms Featherstone said he had raised a 'critical issue'. Pledge: Ms Featherstone said that David Cameron would host a summit in July with the aim of stepping up global efforts to end both FGM and child early enforced marriage within a generation . She was then asked by Angela Watkinson whether she agreed the problem was part of a wider issue of gender inequality. The MP for Hornchurch and Upminster asked: 'Would you agree FGM is part of a much wider issue of cultures where gender equality is not recognised and will you take every opportunity possible when contacting countries where this applies to further the cause?' The minister replied: 'I can assure you I do take every opportunity to raise the issue. 'These social norms which oppress and suppress women - and have been going for 4,000 years - are really because of women’s low status in the world in terms of rights, in terms of voice, choice and control over their own lives.'","Lynne Featherstone calls for tackling FGM to be part of the curriculum .

"By . James Slack . Police yesterday admitted that three murderers – one of whom went on the run 17 years ago – are among almost 90 inmates missing from a notorious open jail. Last week, a row erupted after it emerged that a staggering 88 convicts had absconded from HMP Ford in West Sussex without being recaptured. Now Sussex Police, which kept many of the cases secret for years, have issued a belated appeal to try to catch some of the men. Killers: Timothy O'Leary, 59 (left) was jailed for murder in September 1981 but walked out of Ford Open Prison in 1997. Robert Donovan (right) was jailed for life in 1974 for stabbing a man to death in the street in London . Dangerous: Derek Passmore (left), who murdered a . man in the street in 1996, walked out of the prison last June. Police . are also searching for 48-year-old post office robber David Blood . (right), who left Ford last week . They include Timothy O’Leary, 59, who . walked out of Ford as long ago as 1997. O’Leary, who also used the name . Timothy McCarthy, was jailed for life for the murder of a fellow . traveller in Nuneaton, Warwickshire, in September 1981. Other . wanted killers include Robert Donovan, 57, who was jailed for life in . 1974 for stabbing a man to death in the street in the West End of London . when he was 17. He left Ford prison on day release in June 2010 but police only issued a first appeal to find him last week. Also . on the list is Derek Passmore, 49, who walked out of the prison in June . last year on day release. He was serving life for the brutal murder of . Paul Craig while in a jealous rage in a street in Hampton, West London, . in October 1996. Nick Gibb, the Tory MP whose constituency covers Ford, . expressed alarm at the number of criminals who are absconding from the . open prison, which has previously been described as a ‘holiday camp’. Police are seeking Steven Evans, 55 (left) who was jailed for life in February 2003 for a pre-meditated assault on a man with a metal bar in a car park in Southend-on-Sea, Essex. Craig Hayler (right) disappeared in March . Under fire: Last week it emerged 90 inmates were on the run from Ford Open Prison. Two have been found . ‘I’m worried about how prisoners are chosen to be sent to Ford open prison, and that too many are absconding,’ he said. ‘The . theory is that these are prisoners who are coming to the end of their . sentences and therefore should no longer be at risk of absconding. The . risk assessment of prisoners who are being sent to Ford is clearly not . vigorous enough.’ Despite 88 criminals being on-the-run from Ford, police only released the identities of eight. Superintendent . Lawrence Hobbs said: ‘We have assessed the cases of every prisoner who . is currently wanted after absconding from Ford prison ... We have no . evidence that any of these men are a danger to the public but because of . the offences they have previously committed we cannot rule it out. ‘We need the public’s help to track them down and return them to custody.’ Arben Nuredini, 39 (left) also known as Arben Alizoti, was jailed for seven years in December 2004 for wounding.

"By . Steve Doughty . Sir James Munby, said he would talk to lawyers, judges and social work chiefs about 'the possible hearing in public of certain types of family case' Members of the public could be allowed in to the family courts to watch cases for the first time, a senior judge said yesterday. The leading family law judge, Sir James Munby, said he would talk to lawyers, judges and social work chiefs about 'the possible hearing in public of certain types of family case'. Sir James' plan raises the prospect of ordinary people being allowed to attend courts as they decide on cases of children taken from their parents into state care, adoption, and where children should live when their families break up. In the past such cases have always been closed to the public because of fears that neighbours and those who knew the families could go to the family courts and then spread damaging gossip about children. The promise to gather 'preliminary pre-consultation views' on allowing the public into family courts will be part of a paper on ending secrecy in the courts to be published shortly by Sir James, who is President of the Family Division. The Daily Mail's campaign against secret justice has highlighted controversial decisions made behind closed doors in the family courts and the closely-related and even more secretive Court of Protection, which deals with the affairs of vulnerable adults. Last year the Mail revealed that the Court of Protection secretly imprisoned a 50-year-old woman, Wanda Maddocks, for trying to get her elderly father out of a care home where she thought his life was in danger. Sir James has since forbidden secret imprisonment and has ordered that judges must publish their rulings in family and Court of Protection cases. Yesterday he said in a circular sent to judges that he is to press for further moves towards openness. Approved journalists have been allowed in to family court hearings since 2009 following an attempt to open up the courts by Labour Justice Secretary Jack Straw. However Mr Straw's rules  applied only to journalists, not to members of the public, and allowed judges to apply reporting restrictions so that nothing about the cases they observed could be published. Sir James' circular also promised that his consultation, to be published 'shortly', will press for the publication of court documents, so that outsiders who attend family courts will be able to understand lawyers and judges who argue their case by reference to secret documents. It will also call for better announcements in advance of what cases will be in the courts and when. 'I will be canvassing views as to any ways in which the guidance can be improved, and, perhaps, extended,' Sir James said.","Plan raises prospect of ordinary people being allowed to attend courts .

"By . Becky Barrow . and Hugo Duncan . Business Secretary Vince Cable (pictured) yesterday warned against a premature rise in interest rates . Vince Cable yesterday warned against a premature rise in interest rates. The Business Secretary sounded the alarm about homebuyers who are being lent mortgages equal to ‘five times’ their salary. An outspoken critic of Britain’s banks, Mr Cable questioned whether such super-size loans were ‘sensible’. He warned that the overheating housing market could lead to a premature rise in interest rates which would jeopardise the recovery. Mr Cable said: ‘There is a risk that the destabilising effects of the rise in house prices, certainly in London and the South East, potentially has a major impact on the economy as a whole. ‘If, for example, interest rates were to rise sooner than they otherwise would have done on the basis of the overall position of the economy, then this potentially is a negative consequence of the imbalance that is happening.’ His comments came as the Bank of England gave its strongest signal yet that interest rates will rise before the end of the year – pushing up mortgage costs of millions of families. Mr Cable said a home loan which is five times bigger than a worker’s salary ‘must raise all kinds of questions about whether this is sensible for lenders and sensible for borrowers’. Mr Cable said the ‘traditional’ model was to lend around three to 3.5 times’ somebody’s salary. Speaking in London yesterday at the headquarters of Bloomberg, the financial newswire, he said: ‘What is going on here?’ The Office for National Statistics this week said house prices have risen by nearly 19 per cent in London over the last year. This is the second fastest rise in house prices in the capital since its records began, and means the average London home now costs nearly £500,000. Mr Cable said his views were not just ‘a personal prejudice’, and cited the recent warning by the International Monetary Fund. Recently, it said some buyers are ‘at risk of borrowing more than they can afford to pay’, he said. In Mr Cable’s constituency of Twickenham, the average person who lives in the leafy London borough and works full-time in the area earns £33,000. Sky high: The Office for National Statistics this week said house prices have risen by nearly 19 per cent in London over the last year . But the average house price is nearly £595,000, according to the property website Zoopla. If they want to buy a house, they would need to borrow a mortgage which is 18 times bigger than their salary. Last week, the Bank of England governor also raised his concerns that the mortgage market is ‘becoming more lax’, less than two months since new rules were meant to make it safer. Around four in ten people who have taken out a mortgage recently are borrowing a loan which is ‘at least’ 3.5 times their salary, which is an all-time high. One in ten borrowed ‘at least’ 4.5 times their salary. For example, this means if they earn £50,000, they are borrowing more than £225,000. The worry is that people are taking out loans that they can afford when interest rates are low, but not when they inevitably go up. More than one million people have bought their first home since 2007, the last time that interest rates were increased in this country. There are fears of the ‘interest rate shock’ that will hit them because they have never experienced an increase in the cost of their mortgage. Warning: Bank of England Governor Mark Carney said that the first increase in Bank Rate since 2007 'could happen sooner than markets currently expect' The Bank yesterday hinted that rates will rise before the end of the year having been frozen at 0.5 per cent since March 2009. Officials on the panel that sets rates said it was ‘somewhat surprising’ that a hike in 2014 was not more widely expected. The comments followed last week’s warning from Governor Mark Carney that the first increase in Bank Rate since 2007 ‘could happen sooner than markets currently expect’. Samuel Tombs, UK economist at Capital Economics, said: ‘The risk of 2014 hike is clearly growing.’ Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, said: ‘Clearly savers will be cheered by the rewards that higher interest rates will bring but the big unknown is how households will react to the prospect of more expensive mortgages. ‘If consumer spending falls as higher mortgage costs eat into disposable incomes the wider economic recovery could be in jeopardy.’ All nine members of the Bank’s rate-setting monetary policy committee voted to hold rates at 0.5 per cent this month, according to minutes of the meeting published yesterday. But the report showed that for some the decision ‘had become more balanced in the past couple of months than earlier in the year’ – suggesting at least one official is close to breaking ranks. The minutes said: ‘The economy was starting to return to normal. Part of that normalisation would be a rise in Bank Rate at some point.’ The Bank added that ‘it still seemed likely that when Bank Rate began to rise it would do so gradually and to a level below its pre-crisis average rate’ of around 5 per cent.","Vince Cable warns against premature rise in interest rates .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Chains such as Pizza Express are stealing business from more formal restaurants, market research shows . Families have helped drive up the popularity of casual dining – where they can enjoy both speedy service and a restaurant atmosphere, say researchers. But the rise of chains such as Nando’s and Pizza Express, which typify the casual dining experience, has come at the expense of more formal eating out. Market research firm NPD Group found that casual dining has increased annual traffic by 11.6 per cent compared with five years ago. NPD said the rise equated to 47million more restaurant visits. Quick-service restaurants, including fast food outlets, coffee shops and bakeries, recorded 4.2 per cent traffic growth. Full service restaurants, however, have seen traffic fall by 11.4 per cent. Families account for more than a third of casual dining visits but only a quarter overall. With an average bill per visit in a casual . dining restaurant standing at £11.90 for a dinner - only slightly more . affordable than the full service where bills average £15.17 - NPD said price was not the only appeal. They said: ‘People tell us that casual dining is the best of both worlds – speed and a good ambience. 'We believe casual dining restaurants will continue to take business from full service restaurants.’ Among the chains in NPD’s casual category are Café Rouge, Café Uno, Garfunkels, Harry Ramsden’s, Nando’s, Pizza Express, Pizza Hut, TGI Fridays and Prezzo. The findings also show Britons see casual dining as a good family option when eating out. Firm NPD Group found casual dining had increased annual traffic by 11.6 per cent but full service restaurants had seen traffic fall by 11.4 per cent . At dinner time, 36 per cent of all the meal occasions in casual dining restaurants are due to family visits, whereas they only account for 25 per cent of the meal occasions in restaurants generally. The casual dining sector remains small, accounting for only 4 per cent of Britain's total foodservice market, which generates 11 billion visits annually. But The NPD Group said further growth was likely. Casual dining visits in Britain grew 1.5 per cent in the year ending March 2014, while fast food restaurants grew 0.6 per cent.","Rise of the casual dining comes at the expense of more formal eating out .

"By . Alexandra Williams . , in Geneva . In rehab: Schumacher was conscious as he was transported 120 miles from Grenoble Hospital to University Hospital Lausanne on Monday morning . Formula One legend Michael Schumacher had his eyes open and was conscious during his transfer from a French hospital to a facility in Switzerland, according to a Swiss report. It also stated that Schumacher, 45, was able to communicate to ambulance staff by nodding his head. Schumacher was transported 120 miles from Grenoble Hospital to University Hospital Lausanne on Monday morning. The report in the Swiss tabloid Blick . stated that the ambulance was operated by Sanitätoberwallis, a company . based in Visp in the canton of Valais rather than from Grenoble or . Lausanne. Ambulance staff . were not told the identity of the world-famous patient in advance. They . also had to relinquish their mobile phones on arrival at Grenoble. Matthias . Volken, medical superintendent of the ambulance firm, said: 'I can . confirm that we carried out the drive to transfer (Schumacher) on . Monday.' The paper said Schumacher had lost a lot of weight during his 170 days in hospital since the accident. Schumacher did not speak, but he communicated by nodding his head and had his eyes open for most of the journey, the paper said. The hospital where he is now being treated is one of Switzerland’s best and has renowned neurology experts. It is in the city of Lausanne, just 20 miles from Schumacher's home, where he lives with his wife Corinna and two children. The University Hospital of the Canton of Vaud (CHUV) in Lausanne, where Schumacher was transferred from a French hospital to begin a lengthy rehabilitation regime after his terrible skiing accident left him in a coma . It is almost 25 weeks ago that Schumacher, a very competent skier, suffered his life-threatening accident. He was holidaying with family and friends in the French resort of Meribel, where he owns a chalet. On Monday his manager Sabine Kehm announced that he was no longer in a coma and had been transferred to Lausanne where he will undergo a lengthy rehabilitation regime.","Former Formula One star was able to communicate with staff by nodding .

"By . Richard  Shears . Ewen Geoffrey Peter, 68, has been arrested in Cambodia on sex charges . A British man who ran website for 'best Thai woman' in Devon has been arrested in Cambodia on sex charges. Officials named the man as 68-year-old Geoffrey Peter Ewen, although Cambodian police are known to often get the names of foreigners muddled. The Briton was arrested in the southern resort of Sihanoukville on charges which include filming her naked against her will. ‘He confessed that he sexually assaulted his girlfriend and produced pornography,’ provincial deputy police chief Mam Makal told the Cambodia Daily website. A Cambodian website used by expatriates claimed that the man had also hired a Vietnamese woman for sex and that police believed the video was being shot for commercial purposes. According to police, Peter has been a regular visitor to Cambodia. He was said to have met his alleged victim, a 20-year-old woman, at the Dream Bar in Sihanoukville, a drinking establishment which claims to have the ‘most beautiful girls in Sihanoukville’,and where a draft beer sells for just 75 cents. They began a sexual relationship, but a week later the woman went to police. She claimed that she had caught Peter videoing her as she left the bathroom naked - and that he had used a sex toy against her will while they were having sex. Mr Makal said police raided the guesthouse where the Briton was staying and seized a computer, camera, sex toys and a generic form of Viagra. The Briton was arrested in the southern resort of Sihanoukville (pictured) on charges which include filming her naked against her will . Police photographed him in his room wearing a red Arsenal T-shirt. Geoffrey Peter Ewen is a former director of a now-dissolved company called Tiger Stop Ltd, with an address in Teignmouth, Devon. On its website it carries a promotion for 'Thai women', which invites readers interested in 'best Thai women' to register for free. Just last January Briton Stuart Green, 47, from Eccles was found dead in a Phnom Penh hotel room after reportedly taking his life while police were hunting him for the murder of a 20-year-old local woman. Cambodia was one of the haunts of notorious paedophile Gary Glitter, who fled the country and set up home in neighbouring Vietnam. He was arrested and jailed on child molestation charges before being deported to Britain.

"By . Tom Mctague, Mail Online Deputy Political Editor . Islamic terrorists fighting in Iraq are 'planning to attack us here at home in the United Kingdom', David Cameron said today. The Prime Minister told MPs that the crisis in the Middle East must not be dismissed as 'nothing to do with us'. He said the jihadist insurgents in Iraq, Syria, Somalia and Nigeria would 'come back and hit us at home' if the UK did not help defeat them. David Cameron told MPs during Prime Minister's Questions that the threat posed by ISIS militants was not confined to the Middle East. He said they were planning to turn their fire on Britain . The damning warning came after former security minister Baroness Neville-Jones claimed Britain was sending more Islamic extremists to Syria and Iraq than any other country in Europe. Speaking in the Commons Mr Cameron said: 'I'd disagree with those people who think this is nothing to do with us and if they want to have some sort of extreme Islamist regime in the middle of Iraq that won't affect us – it will. 'The people in that regime, as well as trying to take territory, are also planning to attack us here at home in the United Kingdom. Baroness Neville-Jones has said more young men leave the UK to become jihadis than anywhere else in Europe . 'So the right answer is to be long term, hard-headed, patient and intelligent with the interventions that we make, and the most important intervention of all is to make sure that these governments are fully representative of the people who live in their countries, that they close down the ungoverned space, and they remove the support for the extremists. 'If we do that, not just in Syria, but we have to help in Iraq, in Somalia, in Nigeria, in Mali, because these problems will come back and hit us at home if we don't.' Earlier, Baroness Neville-Jones warned there is a danger of 'a sufficient number' of British citizens travelling to fight in Iraq and Syria becoming radicalised against the West and returning 'with the intention of doing damage.' The former chairman of the British Joint Intelligence Committee said militants in the region posed the gravest threat to Britain today, as Iraq's ambassador to the U.S. warned ISIS extremists could produce 'a thousand' global terrorists like Osama bin Laden. Lukman Faily has said if the U.S. and other nations focus too much on Iraq's internal politics and ignore the 'immediate threat' of a terrorist movement that's gathering steam, the results will be catastrophic. Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Baroness Neville-Jones said there was a danger of 'real radicalisation' if British citizens travelled to fight. She said: 'I think the danger lies in their desire to go, for whatever motive, and what happens to them when they are there, then that's the danger of real radicalisation, coming back with skills and without any other activity in life and motive.' She warned a 'sufficient number' could return to the UK with the 'intention of doing damage.' The former Tory minister said: 'I think it's entirely undesirable that any should go and indeed I think it may become an offence to do that. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEOS . Lukman Faily, the Iraqi ambassador to the United States, warned CNN's Christiane Amanpour that 'a thousand' Osama bin Ladens could emerge from among the Sunni extremists pushing to take over Baghdad . Pushing back: Iraqi Shiite tribesmen are joining state-run security forces in the fight against Jihadist militants who have taken over several northern Iraqi cities; Iraq's US ambassador says his country needs America's help to prevent 'a thousand' Bin Ladens from turning the globe into a terrorist shooting gallery . 'But I think a sufficient number will be radicalised and will be radicalised in ways where this notion about how it's the West's fault will get embedded in their thinking and they will come back with the intention of doing damage.' Baroness Neville-Jones said: 'Unfortunately, I think the UK exports more young men to become jihadis in Europe than any other.' She went on to say: 'The intelligence picture is fairly clear. There's no doubt the numbers are there and there is a real danger of these young men when they come back getting into serious trouble. 'Our ability to track what's going on is infinitely greater than it was post 9/11 which I think is one of the reasons why we haven't seen the national alert rise.' Baroness Neville-Jones was asked whether young men with 'muddled views' about fighting with Muslims, when in Iraq and Syria they would also be fighting against other Muslims, should be regarded 'as potential radicals'. She said: 'I think we can't take the risk of this kind of thinking just brewing without any kind of antidote.' She suggested educating and providing young men with more information in the short-term, along with a longer-term process of better integration. Mr Cameron yesterday said the police service and spy agencies have been ordered to focus their efforts on the Islamic insurgents, particularly those returning to Britain. Today's warnings were backed by security expert Professor Peter Neumann who said Britain will be 'haunted' by the threat of terror for years to come. Professor Neumann, director of the International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation, said the country faced a 'significant' risk from a minority of those who joined groups such as Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (Isis). He said: 'I think personally that it is a threat that will continue to haunt this country and other European and western countries for years to come. 'Even if Isis is pushed back from Iraq, they are still going to exist. This is going to be keeping the security services and police busy for many years to come.' The ICSR estimates that between 400 and 500 Britons have gone to fight in Syria, with many believed to have joined the ranks of Isis. Professor Neumann said: 'Up to about a week ago almost all of them were in Syria but we are now seeing reports of people crossing the border into Iraq.' It comes after MailOnline revealed more . British citizens have signed up to fight in Iraq and Syria than joined . the Army Reserve last year. Ministers have been caught off-guard . by the speed of the insurgency by the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) sweeping through Iraq, with more evidence emerging of . brutal executions. Several . hundred Britons have travelled to the region to join militants in . fighting, but just 170 extra reservists enlisted over the past year. Mr Cameron yesterday insisted the prospect of battle-hardened jihadists returning to the UK was a ‘real threat to our country’. Mr Faily has warned of the dangers of . the U.S and other nations focussing too much on Iraq's internal politics . and ignoring the extremist movement. 'This . is a global tumor in Iraq taking place now and in Syria,' he said, . referring to the Sunni militant group calling itself ISIS. 'We've seen it before.' ISIS aims to establish a caliphate -- an Islamic state that transcends national borders -- in areas of Syria and Iraq, and it has captured at least nine cities in the two countries . The . White House has scolded Nouri al-Maliki's government in Baghdad for . provoking ISIS by alienating the country's Sunni minority. Barack . Obama said on Friday that U.S. military intervention would be . conditioned on reconciliation efforts from Maliki's Shia majority. 'Any . action that we may take to provide assistance to Iraqi security forces . has to be joined by a serious and sincere effort by Iraq’s leaders to . set aside sectarian differences, to promote stability, and account for . the legitimate interests of all of Iraq’s communities,' Obama said in . public remarks. 'So . this should be a wake-up call.  Iraq’s leaders have to demonstrate a . willingness to make hard decisions and compromises on behalf of the . Iraqi people in order to bring the country together.' Baroness Neville-Jones backed Prime Minister David Cameron's comments that militants in Iraq and Syria pose the gravest threat to Britain today . But Faily suggested during an interview with CNN's Christiane Amanpour that Obama is naively fiddling while Baghdad burns. 'These are all ""nice to have"" discussions,' he said, but 'what we have in Iraq now, to -- is an immediate threat.' 'But . do you not feel this is an immediate threat?' Amanpour interrupted, . 'that practically half the country feels disenfranchised? The Sunnis?' 'We're . not saying we're not happy to [have a] discussion,' he responded. 'We . want to have that discussion. But we're saying conditioning that . discussion is not wise. Making clear that we all stand together against a . threat in global terrorism is the question.' 'Let me give you an example. What you have in Afghanistan, with one Bin Laden – you will have a thousand of them.' 'No POWs,' he warned. 'Nothing, none of that. No rules of engagement but destruction.' 'That's the situation in Iraq.' Obama told . Congress on Monday that he is sending 275 armed military men and women . into Baghdad to protect American embassy personnel and assets as they . are moved elsewhere in Iraq and to Jordan. They . will be 'armed for combat,' the White House said, while insisting that . the ground troops won't be the first drop in an ocean of military . entanglements of the sort that Obama campaigned against in 2008 and . 2012. An . administration official also said Monday that the president is . considering the deployment of a small contingent of Special Forces to . Iraq, specifically to help the al-Maliki government slow the advance of . ISIS. Obama . is also mulling unilateral air strikes to hamper ISIS, but . administration sources told MailOnline on Tuesday that the primary . objection to that strategy is political, not tactical. The . National Security Staff, one source said, is concerned that forcing . ISIS off the battlefield now that neighboring Iran has sent 2,000 of its . elite Quds forces to stabilize the region could effectively clear the . way for Iran to seize oil fields and other lands in eastern Iraq.","Prime Minister says insurgents in Iraq planning attacks on the UK .

"By . Mia De Graaf . From the boxing ring in Liverpool, to Nazi camps in Greece, Douglas 'Duggie' Pomford was the bare-fisted bruiser who scaled German strongholds and took them on face-to-face. Having battled his way to success in the ring at home, 'Duggie' was hand-picked to join a special troop of elite fighters - and let loose on the enemy. In one incident in 1944, the 24-year-old even catapulated himself into the bedroom of two senior Nazi militants as they changed into their pyjamas...and disposed of them with his bare hands. Fighter: Douglas 'Duggie' Pomford (pictured left as an amateur boxer at home in Liverpool and right, on the right, fighting in Greece) was hand-picked to join an elite troop of fighters who raided Nazis' rooms barehanded . Medals: His Military Medals for bravery have been uncovered and are going under the hammer for £50,000 . Now, 70 years on from his perilous night raids, Sergeant Pomford's family has uncovered his Military Medals for bravery, which are going under the hammer for an estimated £50,000. Duggie's rise to Special Commando was fast - and he narrowly escaped death on a number of occasions. He had ploughed his way through opponents at . home in Liverpool, and was almost ready to settle . as a champion of the amateur boxing ring in 1940. Little did he know, he had bigger fish to fry. He had only been in the army for six . months when he was handpicked to join the British Commandos and went on . to become a founding member of the Special Boat Service. In November 1941, he had been due to take part in the disastrous attempt to capture Field . Marshall Erwin Rommel. But . the submarine he was on had to withdraw due to weather conditions and . he missed the ill-fated raid, which ended in the capture of all but . three of the 34 commandos involved. After . joining the crack Special Boat Section, Sgt Pomford was among 200 . soldiers stationed at their training base in Palestine from where they . carried out a raid on three airfields in Nazi-occupied Crete. At war: Sergeant Pomford (left) with his raiders who were shot as they fought for Britain's base in Greece . Sgt Pomford’s unit then turned their attention to the islands of Kos and Leros which they cleared and established an airfield. But . the Nazis retaliated and reclaimed the islands, forcing the commandos . to retreat to Turkey where they were arrested by neutral forces and . later released. Sgt Pomford was awarded the Military Medal for his bravery during the raids on the Greek islands. A second Military Medal was awarded to Sgt Pomford for devastating attacks on Ios, Amorgos and Naxos in 1944 - including his bedroom attack on two Nazi officers. It . was the middle of the night and the Allies had just been forced back . into Turkey, surrendering their airfield on the Mediterranean islands. With . victory still a distant fantasy, British commanders decided to deploy a . team of elite fighters to take it on fro the inside - and Duggie was . one of them. Incredibly, the . 24-year-old set upon the enemy as they were changing into their pyjamas. The two soldiers launched themselves at their attacker and tried to kill him with their bare hands. But Duggie, or Sergeant Pomford, had not lost his skills honed in the ring back home and promptly dispatched of them. In 1945 Sgt Pomford qualified as a paratrooper and took part in further operations in the Balkans before being demobilised in 1946. Undercover: Sergeant Pomford had a Nazi uniform (pictured) he donned on occasion to mislead enemy aircraft . Wounded: Here Duggie receives first aid treatment for a shrapnel wound before ploughing on . On his return home Sgt Pomford became the foreman at the Port of Liverpool Stevedoring Company and was instrumental in settting up the famous Golden Gloves Amateur Boxing Club. He died in 1969 aged 49. His medal set, which also includes the 1939-45 Star, the Africa Star, the Italy Star and the War Medal 1939-45, is now being sold by his family. It is tipped to fetch £50,000. A spokesman for the family said: 'These medals are being sold because they have been in a biscuit tin for 60-odd years and have never been on display. 'The hope is that they will go to somebody who will understand and appreciate them. 'They are a part of history and they need to go to someone who can not only treasure them but also afford to insure them, which I can’t. 'It’s a way of keeping his legend alive and is much better than them staying in the biscuit tin.' Pierce Noonan, from London auctioneers Dix Noonan Webb, said: 'Pomford was a classic Special Forces hero. 'A pugnacious Liverpudlian, he developed his fighting skills in the boxing ring in his home city and then used them to lethal effect in raids on German forces in the Eastern Mediterranean. 'Even among the highly decorated founders of the Special Boat Section, he stood out as exceptionally brave and tenacious.' The auction will take place on June 26 in London.","Douglas 'Duggie' Pomford was recruited to join elite band of fighters .

"By . Sean Poulter . Hundreds of railway stations are to open ‘click and collect’ stores, including changing rooms, for people to pick up their internet purchases . Women shopping on the web for the perfect little black dress or a new pair of shoes will be able to collect them up the following day from the train station as they make their way home. Many of the outlets will have changing rooms to allow people to try on their latest purchases and return them immediately if they don’t fit or match expectations. Hundreds of railway stations are to open Doddle click and collect stores where customers can pick up their internet purchases and try them on. Pictured is the first such store in Milton Keynes . Big brands such as the fashion chains ASOS, New Look and TM Lewin, have joined the initiative with many other stores and courier firms expected to follow suit. Open seven days a week, the shops will fit around people’s busy lifestyles and enable them to choose exactly how, when and where they receive or return internet purchases. The initiative offers huge benefits for shoppers, who do not have to wait at home for deliveries, while retailers can save on couriers by dropping items off at one central hub. There will also be an associated website and notifications service through text message and email to let customers know when their parcel has arrived. The scheme is the result of a £24million joint venture between Network Rail, which runs the nation’s stations, and the founder of the Travelex currency bureaux chain, Lloyd Dorfman. The first of the chain of click and collect stores, which is called Doddle, has opened in Milton Keynes with others to follow at London Waterloo, Bromley South, Brighton, Chelmsford and London Cannon Street before the end of August. The rest of the 300 will open over the next three years, creating an estimated 3,000 jobs in a venture that will turn railway stations into internet shopping hubs. The Doddle service is the only one of its kind that is available to every retailer, e-tailer, parcel carrier and shipper, creating a network of hubs for the collection and return of web purchases. Customers using the service pay no fee . provided the retailer, such as ASOS, is an official Doddle partner. However, people can also choose to get items from other web outlets . delivered to the chain’s railway shops for a small fee, which is likely . to be less than £5. A Doddle . spokesman said: ‘The service will allow consumers to combine . collections and returns from multiple retailers into one trip at a time . that suits them or coincides with an already planned journey.’ Big brands such as the fashion chains ASOS, New Look (Oxford Street branch pictured) and TM Lewin, have joined the initiative - with many other stores and courier firms expected to follow suit . Chief executive, Tim Robinson, who was previously a senior executive at Network Rail, said: ‘We created Doddle to improve the online shopping experience. We’re not another ‘me too’ click and collect offer, it’s a game-changing service consumers are crying out for but no one else can provide. ‘We offer a premium service with contemporary shops, advanced technology and highly trained staff delivering a dedicated customer experience. ‘It is the next major step in online shopping, providing a parcel collection, returns and delivery service that has customer choice and convenience at its very heart.  What’s more, we are delivery carrier and retailer agnostic so any brand can offer the Doddle service to their customers.’ Robin Gisby, Network Rail’s managing director, network operations said: ‘More people are travelling by rail than ever before and stations have become more than just a place to wait for, or get off a train. We’ve adapted to passengers’ changing needs and now offer quality retail, food and drink at our biggest stations, such as London Waterloo. ‘Introducing Doddle to stations will enable us to reinvest our profits back into the railway and is a natural next step to help passengers and people who work and live near stations, whose lives are increasingly busy and on the move.’","Hundreds of stations to open 'click and collect' stores plus changing rooms .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . Half of voters think Labour should ditch Ed Miliband before the general election, according to the latest poll which will make grim reading for the under-pressure leader. In a damning assessment of his hopes of winning the election, even 43 per cent of Labour supporters think Mr Miliband should go. It comes after a separate survey revealed his personal ratings have plummeted to a record low, worse even than Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg. Ed Miliband's personal ratings have plummeted from a high of -12 two years ago to a new low of -39 . Labour leader Ed Miliband, speaking at Prime Minister's Questions today, has been hit by a run of bad polls . Labour remains ahead in the opinion polls, but the dire public perception of the leader will alarm party strategists who fear voters do not see Mr Miliband as a potential Prime Minister. An IpsosMORI survey found 49 per cent of all voters think Mr Miliband should be ousted, including 43 per cent of Labour backers, the Standard reported. The figures are worse than both the Lib Dem and Tory leaders. Only 44 per cent think Mr Clegg should be given the boot, while just 27 per think the Conservatives should ditch David Cameron. Just 22 per cent of those surveyed think Mr Miliband is 'ready to be Prime Minister', down from 24 per cent last year. The Labour  leader is under intense pressure from his MPs and party members with less than a year until the general election. After a run of PR gaffes, Mr Miliband’s net satisfaction rating has dropped to -39, even worse than Mr Clegg’s -37 points. Last week he was forced to apologise for posing with a copy of The Sun, after MPs and councillors from Liverpool complained about the newspaper’s history of reporting on the Hillsborough disaster. It followed car crash TV and radio interviews in which Mr Miliband stumbled on grocery bills and local Labour councillors, and a notorious picture of him struggling to eat a bacon sandwich. Just 22 per cent of voters think Mr Miliband is doing a 'good job', the lowest figure of any of the party leaders . David Cameron enjoys the best ratings of any leader, with UKIP leader Nigel Farage close behind . The latest ICM poll for The Guardian yesterday put Labour on 32 per cent, ahead of the Tories on 31 per cent, UKIP on 16 and the Lib Dems on just 10. But when asked if the leaders are doing a good or bad job, David Cameron is well ahead. Some 42 per cent of people think Mr Cameron is doing a good job, with 47 per cent saying he is doing a bad job, giving him a net rating of -5. By comparison, just 22 per cent of people rated Mr Miliband as doing a good job - the worst of all the leaders - while 61 per cent said a bad job. It means he has a net rating of a woeful -39 points. One in four people - 25 per cent - said Mr Clegg was doing a good job and 62 per cent a bad job, giving a net rating of -37.

"By . Emma Glanfield . A British chef died after accidentally inhaling laughing gas in France just two days after telling his family he was to become a father, an inquest heard. Jordan Guise, 21, was found dead at his flat in Beziers, southern France, by concerned restaurant bosses after he failed to turn up for work on February 6 this year. Stourport Coroners Court heard Mr Guise - who was originally from Kidderminster, West Midlands, and known to his friends as Jord - died just days after his girlfriend Kim Taylor told him she had fallen pregnant. Jordan Guise, 21, was found dead at his flat in Beziers, southern France, by concerned restaurant bosses after he failed to turn up for work on February 6 this year. A coroner ruled his death was an accident at the inquest . Tragically, she miscarried their child the day after his funeral on February 24. At the hearing into his death yesterday, Worcestershire deputy coroner Marguerite Elcock ruled the head chef died as a result of an accident. She said: ‘He was a recreational user of nitrous oxide and paraphernalia associated with taking it was found surrounding him. ‘There is no evidence he deliberately intended to take his own life. ‘I conclude this young man died as a result of an accident.’ The court heard that French authorities gave the medical cause of death as asphyxiation through the use of the legal high. Mr Guise’s mother, Leesa Malpas, 47, told the court how she discovered her son had become a recreational user of the high, known as laughing gas, in 2010. She said that last summer, during a holiday to Malaga, Spain, her son was introduced to the gas, which friends had since told her he regularly enjoyed. The chef, originally from Kidderminster, West Midlands, had just told his family his girlfriend was pregnant . When Mr Guise was offered an opportunity to work in France, he thought getting away from England might help him cut down on drug use. He started at La Charniere restaurant in Beziers last August and was quickly promoted to head chef. In November, Miss Taylor started working at the restaurant and the couple began a relationship. In January, she found out she had become pregnant. On February 4, Mr Guises called his mother and father Michael, 52, to tell them his news and said the couple had discussed terminating the pregnancy. However, his girlfriend decided at the last minute to keep the baby and Mr Guise had said he wanted her to either go ahead with the termination or move back to France to raise the baby, the inquest heard. He arranged to update his parents with their decision a few days later – but they instead got a phone call to say their son had been found dead. Mr Guise had just been named head chef at this British-French restaurant in Beziers when he died . Mrs Malpas told the coroner her son was not depressed about the situation and was ‘being very practical and knew something had to be done’. She added: ‘I think he might have been high at the time. ‘I do not think for one minute he would have taken his own life.’ Speaking at time of his death from the family home in Kidderminster, Worcestershire, Mrs Malpas said: ‘The cause of Jordan’s sudden demise is ironic - it was a substance that is freely available and a legal high - laughing gas - that actually took his life. ‘He lived his dream - to be a head chef in France. ‘He was passionate about his work and was very proud of himself, as were his family, friends and work colleagues.’","Jordan Guise was found dead at his flat after failing to turn up for work .

"By . Liz Hull . A toddler lost her mother and three relatives when their car crashed on the way home from a trip to the seaside. Holly Hind, 18 months, was the sole survivor when her great-uncle Martyn Pugh’s car was in a pile-up with a fuel tanker and a van. Her 28-year-old mother, Alison, Mr Pugh, 47, and his partner’s elderly parents, John and Margaret Kehoe, all died. Survivor: Holly Hind, 18 months, (left) was the sole survivor when her great-uncle Martyn Pugh's car was in a pile-up with a fuel tanker and a van, killing her 28-year-old mother, Alison (right), Mr Pugh, 47, and his partner’s elderly parents, John and Margaret Kehoe . They were returning home on the A44 in Mid Wales following a trip to the seaside at Aberystwyth. The road was named last year as one of the worst in the country for accidents and fatalities. Mr Pugh’s Ford Focus collided head-on with a Scania fuel lorry between the villages of Llangurig and Ponterwyd at around 3pm on Tuesday. The driver of a Ford Transit van that crashed into the back of their car escaped uninjured as did the lorry driver. But the four adults in the Ford were killed. Holly, who was strapped into a child seat, was airlifted to hospital in Cardiff. Although she suffered serious head injuries she is expected to survive. Her father, 36-year-old mechanic Steve Hughes, is at her bedside. The incident led to a 21-mile stretch of the road being closed for 12 hours. Scene: The 'dangerous' A44 in Powys was closed for 12 hours after the tragic crash . Yesterday Holly’s great-grandfather, Emrys Davies, 80, said: ‘The police came for Steve and he is in Cardiff with Holly in hospital. We are all just hoping she will be okay.’ Lynn Kehoe, 39, was last night said to be devastated. Neighbour Alan Crisp said: ‘She was very tearful. She has lost both her parents and her partner at the same time so we are all feeling for her. I have known Martyn for many years – he and his family are nice people.Martyn was the full-time carer for Lynn’s dad who was in a wheelchair and was quite ill. He was only able to go out if Martyn took him.’ Councillor Gareth Morgan said their village of Llanidloes in Mid Wales was in shock. He has called on the Welsh Government to carry out an urgent review of the A44, which is the main road from the Midlands to the west coast of Wales. Loss: Holly's father Steve Hughes, 36, pictured with Ms Hind is at his daughter's bedside in hospital in Cardiff . ‘It is a dreadful shock,’ he said. ‘I often saw Martyn with the little girl walking their chocolate Labrador. She is a lovely child. The accident was at a real blackspot, one of the most dangerous stretches of road in Wales. Fatal accidents have happened there far too frequently. ‘Accident statistics tell you in black and white that it is a very dangerous road; scenic but deadly. ‘The Welsh Government have made minor improvements to the highway but there is now an urgent need for a strategic review of that road, before more lives are lost.’ He added: ‘This will have a devastating effect on Llanidloes – we are a small community where we all care for each other. For four lives to be wiped out in an instant like this is very difficult to comprehend.’ Last night a spokesman for Dyfed Powys Police said that Holly remained in a serious but stable condition in hospital. He confirmed the names of the deceased and added: ‘Our thoughts and sympathies are with the family at this incredibly difficult time. ‘Next of kin are being kept informed and are being supported by specialist officers.’ The eldest child of Mr Hughes and Miss Hind, Ethan, six, was at school at the time of the crash. Tragedy: 18-month-old Holly Hind was rescued from the vehicle's wreckage and flown to hospital by air ambulance after a collision involving a fuel tanker and a van in Wales . Holly was flown south to the University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff and is today in a serious condition in hospital but is expected to survive.

"By . Chris Pleasance . An award-winning food blogger has hit out at bakery chain Lola's Cupcakes, accusing it of 'stealing' her recipe for Marmite and chocolate cakes and passing it off as their own. Kerstin Rodgers used her blog, Ms Marmite Lover, to attack the London bakers for saying they made the first official sweet and savory treat last week when she posted a recipe online in 2010. She claims their guide to baking the cakes 'makes no sense' and contains identical passages to her own recipe, which was also published in her book in 2011. Kerstin Rodgers, who goes by the name Ms Marmite Lover online, claims bakery chain Lola's Cupcakes stole her recipe for Marmite and chocolate cupcakes . Proof?: Kerstin posted this image online from the pages of her book showing the recipe for the cupcakes . Speaking to Mail Online, she said: 'I was a bit shocked when I saw the recipe, I thought ""how can they be saying this when they know perfectly well it's not true?"" Ms Rodgers' says that several identical passages from her recipe book appeared in Lola's own guide . 'I have contacted my lawyers about this, but there isn't much case history in the UK because I think people are afraid of taking on big corporations. 'Lola's have sent me a message saying they are formulating a response, so we will see what the next step is after that. 'They should absolutely not be allowed to get away with this. 'If they wanted my recipe they could have just hired me, but instead they decided to run roughshod over my work for their own gain.' On her blog, she added: 'Their recipe makes no sense. The ingredients and the method do not match. That's what tends to happen when you copy and paste from someone else's work, you slip up. 'The biggest ""coincidence"" is that the genius who runs Lola's Cupcakes came up with this quote: ""The centre will either be a shock or a pleasure depending on where your Marmite sensibilities lie!"" 'Lets compare and contrast with my blog post of 2010 which says: ""This 'centre' would either be a shock, or a pleasure depending on where your Marmite sensibilities lie"".' Ms . Rodgers said Lola's has no right to . claim theirs as the first Marmite cupcakes, as the brand contacted her . in 2010 to make a recipe. She also accused Lola's of 'bungling' her recipe, with online users complaining that the instructions were impossible to follow. In . a joint statement, Lola's and Marmite denied that the recipe was . stolen. The companies said: 'Ms Marmite Lover’s cupcake has a vanilla sponge and cream cheese topping, while Lola’s is chocolate sponge with a buttercream chocolate ganache frosting. 'The only similarity is the use of a liquid centre that is found in over a third of Lola’s range. This is a standard caramel recipe with some Marmite added.' Last week Lola's released the 'first ever' Marmite cupcakes. Managing director Asher Budwig said he was 'always searching for ways to create innovative, exciting cupcakes with unusual ingredients' Ms Rogers said Lola's recipe 'makes no sense' as parts from her guide were used out of context . Ms Rodgers began blogging about her recipes in 2008 under the name Ms Marmite Lover, then shot to fame by hosting an underground supper club at her north west London home. Since then has won the Fortnum And Mason Online Food Writer Award 2014 and the Guild of Food Writers Food Blog of the Year Award 2013. Many other supper clubs have now popped up in the capital and beyond, and Ms Rodgers' website plots them on a map, helping to spread the trend. Popular: Ms Rodgers shot to fame in 2009 after she began hosting supper clubs at her north west London home . Kerstin Rodgers, aka Ms Marmite Lover for followers of her blog, began writing online about food and recipes in 2008. However she wasn't truly well known until 2009, when she began hosting a supper club at her home in north west London, one of the capital's first underground restaurants. Since the trend for supper clubs took off, she has become a household name, publishing a book of her recipes called Supper Club: Recipes And Notes From The Underground Restaurant. She also won the Fortnum And Mason Online Food Writer Award 2014 and the Guild of Food Writers Food Blog of the Year Award 2013. Her writing has appeared in several national newspapers, and she was named among the 1000 most influential Londoners in a poll. She has nearly 14k followers on Twitter and 4,500 followers on her Facebook page. She also trained as a photographer and has had a number of exhibitions in Paris, Chartres and London. In another, rather more bizarre brush with stardom, the 80s hit ‘My girl’s mad at me’ by Madness was written about her.","Kerstin Rodgers shot to fame in 2009 hosting supper clubs at her home .

"By . Tom Mctague, Mail Online Deputy Political Editor . Britain is an 'old and declining empire' that is embarrassed about its standing, a Chinese newspaper owned by the ruling Communist Party has claimed. The damning editorial was published after it was reported that the country's Prime Minister Li Keqiang had demanded an audience with the Queen. The Global Times, a newspaper widely seen as the mouthpiece of the Beijing government, denounced the claim as a sign of British prejudice against the emerging economic giant. The article criticising Britain emerged as Chinese Premier Li Keqiang continued his visit to London, including visiting the House of Lords . Mr Li met Lord Speaker Baroness D'Souza in the River Room of the Houses of Parliament . Earlier the Chinese premier shared a platform with Chancellor George Osborne at the UK-China Financial Forum at Lancaster House, in London . The Global Times said: 'Chinese people should forgive Britain's confusing sentiment' The Queen received the Chinese premier Li Keqiang and his wife at Windsor Castle yesterday after claims he demanded a meeting as part of his official visit. But a Chinese newspaper owned by the Communist regime said the 'eccentric' claims were designed to mask Britain's embarrassment at being an 'old and declining empire' The paper also accused the British media of 'hyping' concerns over China's human rights record and claimed it was time for a 'realistic recognition of the two countries' power' - with the UK no longer in the same league as China. 'Perhaps Chinese people should forgive Britain's confusing sentiment,' said the Global Times editorial. 'A rising country should understand the embarrassment of an old declining empire and at times the eccentric acts it takes to hide such embarrassment. 'Diplomacy has to be based on realistic recognition of the two countries' power. No matter for China or the UK, it will be tiring if they try to distort this reality.' The Global Times said it was 'completely normal and proper' for the Chinese Premier to meet the Queen, and said that it was London, not Beijing, which 'conceives they could utilise different options to express its opinions'. It added: 'British public opinion remains prejudiced against China and highly expects to embrace an opportunity to prove that it is superior compared with the emerging nation. Nevertheless, engaging in economic co-operation with Beijing is in its practical interests. The Prime Minister has rolled out the red carpet for Mr Li during his three-day state visit amid hopes of closer economic ties between the two countries . 'Whenever Chinese and British leaders meet with each other, the British media habitually hypes China's human rights and calls on the British Government not to sell its soul in exchange for Beijing's trade pacts. 'Britain's national strength cannot be placed in the same rank as China now, a truth difficult to accept for some Britons who want to stress their nobility. If they refuse to recognise this fact and find fault with China on purpose, even at the cost of bilateral relations, they will not find any mental comfort.' Prime Minister David Cameron's official spokesman sought to shrug off the significance of the article, telling a Westminster media briefing: 'I read in The Times of London Premier Li's article when he said this was a great nation. That is the Prime Minister of China's view.' China's diplomatic clout has soared as its economy has boomed over the last 30 decades. Since 1980 it has seen economic growth of 10 per cent a year on average .","Her Majesty received the Chinese PM Li Keqiang and wife at Windsor Castle .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . Britain is one of the loneliest countries in Europe, with less connection to their neighbours and no-one to turn to in a crisis, a new report reveals. Britons are also less happy with their social life than most Europeans and feel less safe walking home at night. The state of the nation is revealed in a new report from the Office for National Statistics into how wellbeing varies across the continent. It is part of the project ordered by David Cameron to major how the nation feels, as well as what it earns through the economy. ‘An individual’s dwelling, their local environment and the type of community in which they live may all have an effect on a person’s well-being,’ the Office for National Statistics said. But the league tables on life in the 18 EU member states reveals stark differences between the countries. While Britain is financially better off than most countries, with low unemployment and largely good health, it recorded some of the lowest figures for having a sense of 'belonging' where people live. Just 75 per cent of people in the UK feel safe walking home at night in the city or area where they live, compared to 85 per cent in Slovenia. Barely half of Britons – 58 per cent – say they feel close to people in the area where they live, the lowest in the whole of Europe with the exception of Germany on 58.3 per cent. People in the UK also feel less supported when things go wrong. Only 88.7 per cent of people said they had support from family, friends or neighbours to help cope with a serious personal or family matter. This puts the UK third from bottom in the European league table, ahead only of France and Denmark, but well behind the EU average of 93.0. The highest-ranking country was Slovakia (98.8 per cent). Health can also have a major impact on the way people view their lives. The ONS said: ‘According to the Department of Health, there is a two way relationship between well-being and health: health influences well-being and well-being influences health.’ Almost a third of people (32.9 per cent) report having a long-standing illness or health problem, slightly higher than the EU average. Only 62.7 of Britons say they health is good or very good, compared to an EU average of 64 per cent and well behind the highest ranked country, Ireland, where 75.3 per cent were in good health. Britons seem to be fitter than most of Europe, with 46.8 per cent of over-16s taking part in sports or physical exercise at least once a week. This was higher than the EU average of 39.7 per cent and similar to Germany (47.6 per cent). The highest proportion of people who took part in sports or physical exercise at least once a week were in Finland and Sweden (72.5 per cent and 70.4 per cent respectively), while the lowest proportion was in Bulgaria (12.0 per cent), the ONS said. Workers in the UK enjoy higher job satisfaction that the EU average and 26 per cent say they do voluntary work. Some 45.87 per cent say they have time to do things that they really enjoy in their daily lives, well ahead of the lowest ranking country, Romania, on 27 per cent, but behind the Netherlands on 66.3 per cent. People in the UK are also better off than most of the rest of Europe, enjoying a greater share of net national income per head and less at risk of social exclusion.","Only Germans say they feel less close to people in their local area .

"By . Paul Bentley . and Samuel Howitt . The distraught parents of a three-year-old girl who was run over as she played on her scooter said last night they had been ‘robbed of the sparkle of life’. Toddler Rosa Simon was playing outside her family home on a quiet cul-de-sac when she was knocked down by a neighbour late on  Tuesday afternoon. With his vision obscured by a hedge, the man accelerated out of his drive without seeing the little girl and killed her instantly. Paul Simon, the father of three-year-old Rosa Simon, told the BBC he heard a big crash and believed his daughter died instantly. He described her as their 'fantastic, special, loving, exuberant child' She died in Ipswich Hospital last night despite attempts to revive her by her mother Sheeba, 36, who is a nurse. The . accident has raised concerns about the safety of scooters, which allow . children to race away from their parents and out of the eyeline of . oncoming traffic. Reports . suggest there has been a huge increase in casualties involving the . toys, with many children using them without wearing a helmet. Her father Paul Simon described her as their 'fantastic, special, loving, exuberant child'. In a statement released through police, her family said: 'Rosa was a much beloved and loving daughter and sister. 'Small in size, but a giant in character, kindness and with a sheer joy at being alive. 'It has been a privilege to have known her as parents and as siblings. She made us better and happier people. The young girl was knocked down and killed on this quiet cul-de-sac in Hadleigh, Suffolk, yesterday . 'We are devastated by losing her. Her death has robbed us of much of the sparkle of life. We now ask that, as a grieving family, we are given time to be with our dear family and friends.' 'Rosa was a much beloved and loving daughter and sister. 'Small in size, but a giant in character, kindness and with a sheer joy at being alive. 'It has been a privilege to have known her as parents and as siblings. She made us better and happier people. 'We are devastated by losing her. Her death has robbed us of much of the sparkle of life. We now ask that, as a grieving family, we are given time to be with our dear family and friends.' Mr Simon said his daughter was, 'in one of those wonderful heady moments that three- year-olds have', racing around the cul-de-sac on her scooter. He ran to her aid with his wife after hearing a 'big crash'. He added: 'We believe she died instantly.' The driver of the car, who is not related to the girl, received medical treatment for shock, Suffolk Police said. No one has been arrested. Rosa leaves behind an older sister, Millie, and a older brother, Thomas. Neighbour Carla Maloney, 41, said Rosa and her five-year-old son were 'best friends'. The mother-of-two said: 'Rosa was just a lovely, sweet little girl who always had a smile on her face. 'She played with my son and they were best friends. He is only five-years-old and he doesn't understand that she has gone.' Tributes have been left at the scene where Rosa was . killed while she was playing on her scooter . Her father led the tributes to the young girl, but many others left flowers and notes at the scene . Brian Riley, a county and district councillor who knows the family, said: 'People are very upset. 'There are ripples running through the town. The parent's are well-known members of the community.' Mr Simon, who studied at Oxford University, works as a communications manager for Babergh District Council. Charlie Adan, Chief Executive of Babergh District Council, said: 'Our thoughts are with our colleague Paul and his family at this terrible time. 'I hope Paul will know that all his colleagues are deeply saddened and we are here to offer whatever support we can. 'All of the staff and councillors at Babergh and Mid Suffolk send our sincere condolences to Paul and his family.'","Rosa Simon was hit on the pavement by a car pulling out of a Suffolk drive .

"By . Kieran Corcoran . Netherlands striker Robin van Persie has received the ultimate seal of approval after his 93-year-old grandfather joined in social media tributes to a stunning World Cup goal he scored. Van Persie, 30, made an astonishing leaping header to score for the Dutch national side against Spain in a group stage match on Friday. It was one of five goals scored against the defending champions, and is being heralded as one of the most impressive moments of the tournament so far. Scroll down for video... Still got it: Wim Ras, 93, took a photograph of himself re-creating his grandson's spectacular swan dive in the World Cup . Audacious: Robin van Persie, 30, scored the daring goal in a World Cup match against Spain last week . Flying leap: The impressive goal, one of five scored against defending champions Spain, is already being hailed as a definitive moment in the 2014 tournament . The goal has also prompted a tide of copycat photographs from fans on social media - including the striker's own grandfather, Wim Ras. Mr Ras took a picture of himself lying prone on his living room floor mimicking the pose, and later lavished praise on his grandson, who plays for Manchester United. In an interview with Dutch news outlet Omroep Brabant, he said: 'I thought it was a great landing. I have done gymnastics before but those moves are choreographed. Robin had just a fraction of a second to jump.’ He was hardly alone in his appreciation for the goal, which has inspired the #Persieing hashtag on Twitter. Joining in: The #Persieing trend is taking off on social media - with efforts such as this one from Dutch diplomatic staff in London . Followers who have uploaded an attempt of their own include seven staff from the Dutch embassy in London. The eventful game last Friday was Spain's leaviest loss in decades - and particularly galling after their triumph in the 2010 World Cup. The defending champions took an early lead after a dubious penalty but it wasn't long before the Dutch equalised and began their rout. The Dutch took revenge with two goals each for Van Persie and Robben and one by Stefan de Vrij. Spain have won the last three major football tournaments they have played in, wining the European Championships in 2008 and 2012 as well as the 2010 World Cup. Spain, also 2008 and 2012 European champions, took a 27th-minute lead through a Xabi Alonso penalty after Brazilian-born striker Diego Costa went down under a challenge from de Vrij, only for Van Persie to equalise brilliantly in the 44th minute. Sea of orange: Stunning goals from van Persie and Robben ensured an awful start to Spain's World Cup . I carrot believe it! A Dutch fan with a very home-made hat shows his delight in the stadium in Brazil . The Dutch forward stole in between Sergio Ramos and Jordi Alba to meet a searching Daley Blind cross with a powerful diving header that left goalkeeper Iker Casillas rooted. Moments before Van Persie's goal Spain missed a chance to double their lead when midfielder David Silva's cheeky chip was pushed wide for a corner. After the break the Dutch poured forward and went ahead after 53 minutes when Robben got on the end of another superb Blind lobbed pass before turning Gerard Pique and holding off Sergio Ramos to fire home from seven metres. The match opened up but in the Netherlands' favour with De Vrij stealing in on 64 minutes at the back post to convert a free kick after Van Persie put Casillas under pressure. It got worse for Spain as Van Persie added a fourth after taking advantage of a sloppy touch by Casillas to slot home in the 72nd minute and Robben stunned a raucous crowd as he toyed with the Spanish defence and Casillas before belting home in the 80th. The defeat was the heaviest yet for Spain under coach Vicente Del Bosque.

"By . Tom Mctague, Mail Online Deputy Political Editor . Beleaguered Home Secretary Theresa May was today forced to make a grovelling apology to families who have missed their holidays because of the chaos at the Passport Office. The Tory Cabinet minister said she and the Government are 'sorry for any inconvenience' they had caused by failing to control the backlog in applications. She also revealed that the number of people  waiting for their travel documents is now some 25,000 higher than what David Cameron admitted last week. Home Secretary Theresa May apologised for the chaos threatening to ruin family holidays this summer. She said 11 per cent of applications were not being processed in time . Mrs May said 11 per cent of applications are not being processed within three weeks. With the backlog at 493,289 - this means some 54,262 are now at risk of missing their holiday. The Tory minister told MPs that the figure was around 50,000. Speaking in a Commons debate on the passport crisis this afternoon Mrs May said: 'Her Majesty's passport office is dealing with the highest demand for passports for 12 years while the surge in demand usually experienced during the summer months started much earlier in the year. 'As a result, a number of people are waiting too long for their passport applications to be processed. 'I would like to say to anybody who is unable to travel because of a delay in processing their passport application that I am sorry and the Government is sorry for the inconvenience they have suffered and we are doing all we can to put things right.' But MPs heard that crisis is likely to get worse before it gets better this summer. Home Affairs Select Committee chairman Keith Vaz  said: 'We have not yet reached the peak. We actually do need a timetable to get the ""work-in-progress"" working quickly.' Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said it was unacceptable that ministers had not revealed how long it would take to clear the backlog. She said: 'Are we talking about a few weeks or a few months?' Today's Commons debate came after it was revealed that the backlog of passport applications almost doubled in just three months this year. Passport Office chief Paul Pugh admitted almost 500,000 people are now waiting for their travel documents - some 200,000 higher than last year after a surge in applications in the first five months of the year. Mr Pugh, who revealed he earns £104,000 a year, blamed a 'substantially higher intake' of applications. Unions said the Government had 'lost control of the backlog'. Scroll down for video . Passport Office chief Paul Pugh, who earns £104,000 a year, told MPs the backlog had hit 480,000 - around 200,000 higher than usual . Mr Pugh admitted that he considered resigning over the fiasco. He said: 'Of course I've considered whether it would be right for me to have stepped down.' Mike Jones, the Home Office group secretary of the Public and Commercial Services Union representing Passport Office staff, appeared before MPs on the Commons Home Affairs Select Committee this afternoon . Home Affairs Select Committee chairman Keith Vaz questioned the PCS's Mike Jones this afternoon as part of his investigation into the passport crisis . But the PCS union representing passport staff has refused to rule out going on strike over job cuts and privatisation. Mr Pugh said any strike action would be 'extremely damaging'. He told MPs that even before strike action there had 'never been a challenging situation of this kind' in recent years. Mr Pugh apologised to families who suffered delays in their passport applications. Addressing Mr Pugh, the committee chairman Keith Vaz said: 'Would you like to take this opportunity to apologise to all those who have been waiting? I have a sheaf of letters from members of the public, from members of parliament, who are very, very angry. 'You don't seem to recognise the fact that people are very upset and angry. Would you like to apologise?' Mr Pugh replied: 'I absolutely recognise the anger and distress that some people have suffered and I would like to put on record that yes, in every case where we haven't met our service standards, where we haven't been able to meet the customer's needs, yes, certainly, we are sorry for that.' Pictures leaked to MailOnline, showing hundreds of boxes of applications piled on the floor of a Passport Office in Liverpool, piled pressure on the Government to introduce emergency measures to tackle the backlog . The images showed boxes of applications piled in a spare room set aside for interviews. Officials at the Liverpool clearing house where the image was taken said the situation was 'a million times worse' in Durham . Standard passports cost £72.50 - or £46 for children - and should only take three weeks to get. Those needing a passport urgently can pay extra for a premium or fast-track service. The 'premium' service, costing £128, means passports can be collected within four hours of being approved. Under the fast-track service, costing £103, a passport is returned within a week of the application being approved. The Home Office has urged those who have already applied not to resubmit their application. But those that need to leave the country within the next seven days and have been waiting for their passport for more than three weeks can have their application fast tracked for free. British families abroad can get an automatic 12 months extension - while their children will be given emergency travel documents. The Prime Minister last week apologised for the chaos after he revealed  there were at least 30,000 applications outstanding which had not been processed within the normal three-week limit. But it now emerges that his only accounts for a fraction of the true backlog. Amid mounting fury over the passport delays the Government was forced to take urgent action to deal with the crisis. Those who desperately need travel documents were told that they could get their applications fast-tracked free of charge, instead of paying an extra £55.50 a person. But this will only apply to those who have not had their passports back within three weeks and are going abroad in the next seven days. Minister also announced that those renewing their UK passports from overseas will be given an automatic 12-month extension. And families applying from abroad for passports on behalf of their children will be given emergency travel documents as well, the Home Secretary announced. The Passport Office has increased the number of examiners and call centre staff by a further 200 on top of the 1,000 staff already redeployed to deal with a surge in applications running at a 12-year high. Mrs May has drafted in emergency staff - earning up £70 an hour - to the Passport Office to clear the backlog. Around 100 Home Office staff based in the North have been asked to move to the Liverpool Passport Office for up to two months, a letter leaked to MailOnline revealed. This is on top of the 250 backroom staff at the Passport Office which have already been redeployed to the front line. The Government's attempt to head off the growing crisis came after MailOnline published pictures showing hundreds of boxes of passport applications piled on a sorting office floor. Last week passport office workers revealed the pressure they were being put under to clear the backlog. One whistleblower said workers were being left 'suicidal'. He said Mrs May did not have 'any idea' how bad the situation really was and claimed staff were at breaking point. Speaking anonymously, he said he had been working seven days a week for four months to clear the estimated 500,0000 backlog of applications. He said: 'We're tired, we can't concentrate. Theresa May hasn't got any idea. She doesn't now how bad things are.' As the Government moved to avert a summer holiday crisis, hundreds of families last week descended on offices - like this one in London - to renew their passport in person . The whistleblower was asked about the morale at the Passport Office. The worker said: 'It's suicidal. Suicidal. The staff are worn out. 'Management keep changing the goal posts. They come up with crazy ideas and say how can we help, but they don't have a clue. 'The overnight staff are only supposed to work until 9pm, but they are working till midnight. I'm just so tired. 'I just want people to know the truth. I'm worn out, really worn out and it's been going on for far too long.' He added that the Passport Office in Durham was 'a million times worse' than in Liverpool. He added: 'It's really bad - they are way behind.' The worker said that yesterday morning a woman 'burst into tears because of the pressure they're putting on us'. Theresa May ordered hundreds of staff to move from UK Visas & Immigration to the Passport Office, as this leaked letter to MailOnline revealed, to help clear the backlog. But unions said the move would leave other areas short staffed . Last night a spokesman for Her Majesty’s Passport Office said: 'There are currently approximately 480,000 active applications being processed. 'It is not unusual during peak periods for HMPO to operate with high numbers of applications in the system at any one time, with this year seeing the highest levels for 12 years. 'We are working to ensure that the vast majority of people continue to receive their passports within our service standards. 'We have also introduced a range of measures to help those who need to travel urgently, including free upgrades.'","Almost 500,000 Brits waiting for passport after backlog doubled in 3 months .

"By . James Rush . Rory McIlroy has announced he will represent Ireland at the 2016 Olympics in Brazil when golf makes its return to the Games for the first time since 1904. The 25-year-old, who would be eligible to play for either Great Britain or Ireland, had considered not playing at all to avoid upsetting people. But he has now said he has made his decision ahead of this week's Irish Open at Fota Island. Rory McIlroy (pictured on Sunday) has announced he will represent Ireland at the 2016 Olympics in Brazil . 'I’ve been thinking about it a lot,' he told a pre-tournament press conference. 'I don’t know whether it’s been because the World Cup has been in Brazil and I’ve been thinking a couple of years down the line. 'Thinking about all the times that I played as an amateur for Ireland and as a boy and everything, I think for me it’s the right decision to play for Ireland in 2016.' The Northern Irish golfer is Catholic by birth, but is not believed to be particularly religious, and comes from the predominantly Protestant Holywood area of Belfast. He has previously spoken of being in an 'extremely sensitive and difficult position' over the decision, releasing an open letter on his Twitter account in September 2012 in response to quotes attributed to him which said he felt 'more British than Irish'. Asked if he had been 'torn' on the issue, the former world number one said today: 'More worried about what other people would think, rather than me. But you’ve got to do what’s right for yourself and what you feel most comfortable with, and ultimately that was the decision that I made. McIlroy (pictured last month), who would be eligible to play for either Great Britain or Ireland, had considered not playing at all to avoid upsetting people . 'I was always very proud to put on the . Irish uniform and play as an amateur and as a boy, and I would be very . proud to do it again. 'Just . because now that I’m playing golf for money and I’m a professional, I’m . supposed to have this choice or this decision to make, where if you . look at the rugby players, you look at cricketers or hockey players, . they view Ireland as one, the same as we do in golf. 'I don’t think there’s any point to change that or go against that just because it’s a different event or it’s the Olympics. 'I’ve had a lot of time on my own the last few weeks and just been thinking about it a lot. It’s something that’s been quite important to me and something that I needed to make some sort of decision or some sort of stand on it. Changes: McIroy's decision to represent Ireland comes just weeks after he announced he had broken off his engagement to tennis player Caroline Wozniacki, 23 (right) 'Just weighing up everything, and thinking back about the times that I played for Ireland and won the European Team championship with Ireland, won a lot of great amateur titles representing Ireland, I just thought why change that? Basically it’s just a continuation of what I’ve always done.' McIroy's decision to represent Ireland comes just weeks after he announced he had broken off his engagement to tennis player Caroline Wozniacki, 23, saying he had realised he was not prepared for 'all that marriage entails'. The couple, who were together for three years, had been due to marry in November and had sent out their wedding invitiations the weekend before McIroy ended their relationship. 'The problem is mine,' he said. 'The wedding invitations issued at the weekend made me realise that I wasn't ready. 'I wish Caroline all the happiness she deserves and thank her for the great times we've had. Everyone has been through break-ups and it's obviously very, very difficult.'","Rory McIlroy had considered not playing at all to avoid upsetting people .

"By . Sean Poulter . Tesco is launching its own diet service with guidance on how to achieve weight loss goals and a new range of calorie controlled meals. The scheme will put the supermarket head to head with the likes of Weight Watchers and Slimming World, which dominate the weight loss market and have even been accepted into the NHS. Shoppers can put their height and weight into Tesco’s Health and Wellbeing website and will then be offered guidance, fitness advice and a personally tailored eating plan. Slimming: Tesco has launched a range of low-calorie products that combine to create slimming meal plans . Central to the regime is the launch of a range of calorie controlled products under a new brand called ‘my fit lifestyle’. The products fit under one of five colour coded headings ranging from 100 to 500 calories, which can be combined to create a daily menu. The range, which is launching initially in London, builds on a new and emerging trend in the US for personalised eating plans and puts together menu suggestions that will add up to less than 2,000 calories a day. Breakfast might be a ‘Greek style yoghurt with granola, pear, apple, berries’ plus a ‘roasted snack mix’ and a ‘grape, blueberry and pomegranate fruit pot’. Together these add up 398 calories. Lunch could be a ‘superfood salad with pineapple, kiwi and blueberry seed boost’ paired with a pack of ‘smoked paprika and cream cheese popcorn’, which adds up to 608 calories.

"By . John Drayton . Despite losing 2-1 against Italy, England could take many positives from opening World Cup match defeat in Group D. One of them was the form of Daniel Sturridge, with the Liverpool striker scoring on his World Cup debut after grabbing an equaliser for Roy Hodgson's side in Manaus. It was a familiar sight for Reds fans, who have seen the striker score consistently since arriving from Chelsea last year, as was the 24-year-old's trademark dance celebration after his strike. Starting early: Daniel Sturridge has been dancing after scoring since he was a teenager . in the flow: Sturridge celebrates scoring for Manchester City Under 15s against Barcelona . Needs work: Sturridge's celebration as a teenager lacks the finesse compared to today . Reappearance? England fans will hope Sturridge sticks to his original celebration if he scores against Uruguay . And as well as his overall play, it seems the former Manchester City hitman's dance floor moves have also made dramatic improvements over the last 10 years. Footage of Sturridge scoring against a Barcelona youth side in 2004 for City's Under 15 team show a more wild take to the post-match dance celebration - perhaps lacking the finesse with his arms he would develop over the next decade. England fans will hope Sturridge can continue his World Cup form to help shoot down Uruguay in a pivotal clash concerning the Three Lions' last 16 hopes. But to prevent global embarrassment, we would rather Sturridge stick to his modern dance celebration rather than the teenager at a school disco.

"By . Oliver Todd . Spain's legendary coach Vicente Del Bosque admitted he may face the axe after the humiliating World Cup exit following the 2-0 defeat by Chile in the Maracana. It is the first time the reigning champions have been knocked out of the World Cup after just two matches and a number of Spanish players are also facing the chop for the shameful showing. Chile have qualified from Group B along with Holland after goals from Eduardo Vargas and Charles Aranguiz secured victory while Spain's loss, coupled with last week’s 5-1 defeat by Holland has sent them crashing out. Lost for ideas: Del Bosque could not inspire his side to repeat their heroics from 2008, 2010 and 2012 . New feeling: Del Bosque has been used to success but found himself on the end of two defeats in Brazil . Del Bosque said he need to take time to think about his own future and 'what is good for Spanish football'. 'It’s true that when such things happen during a World Cup or a tournament like this then it has consequences but I don’t want to start thinking about that right now. We have time to analyse that and it is not the right time now. 'There will be time to think and reflect what we are going to do. I think this team is good but we have to take a decision about what is good for Spanish football and that applies to myself as well.' Head scratcher: Del Bosque will take time out before making a decision on his managerial future . Alone: The Spain coach looked dejected on the touchline as Spain failed in their task at the Maracana . Del Bosque said Spain had been too timid in the first half against Chile which saw La Roja 2-0 down at the break and with a mountain to climb. 'In the first half we were really shy and sluggish and not brave enough so Chile were able to put the pressure on us. 'In the second half we had more space and some chances but I am trying to find excuses - we played worse than Chile and Holland and so we have lost.' Pressure: The successful Spanish coach oversaw big defeats to Holland and Chile in Brazil . Frustration: The World Cup winner simply failed to get the best out of his world-class squad . VIDEO Reigning champions out as Chile stampede . Chile’s Argentine coach Jorge Sampaoli had sympathetic words for Spain, whose winning streak of two European Championships either side of a World Cup has come to a sorry end. He said: 'In football everything changes. Spain has played very well over the years and had wonderful performances but today that generation of players couldn’t keep that success going, and that’s normal because success is not forever.' Sampaoli said Chile would now go all out to beat the Dutch and finish top of their group which would avoid a likely meeting with hosts Brazil. All over: Sergio Ramos rues Spain's defeat to Chile which ends their reign as World Cup holders . He added: 'Against Holland we will have the same approach knowing we need to win to be first in our group. 'If we don’t win against Holland we will probably have to play Brazil if they win against Cameroon. 'Considering our performances the most important thing is to play as a team - and that’s why we have been so dangerous and have had such good results.' End of an era: Del Bosque and Fernando Torres are unlikely to be at the Russian World Cup in 2018 .

"By . Mark Wilson . Ronny Delia has revealed how a trans-Atlantic phone call to Scott Brown confirmed there would be no lingering issue between the Celtic captain and John Collins. Speculation has surrounded their relationship given that Brown was part of the Hibernian squad when Collins was the victim of a dressing-room revolt in 2007. A group of players reportedly met with chairman Rod Petrie to air grievances about his managerial methods before backing down and apologising. Captain's orders: Brown has given Collins' appointment at Celtic his blessing after a phone call . Brown and Collins will now be reunited when Celtic pre-season training kicks off next week after Delia appointed the former Scotland midfielder as his assistant. The Norwegian has already had an introductory chat with Brown, currently on holiday in Florida, and is confident any problems are no longer relevant. ‘I asked him, of course, about John but as he said it has been many years now and he’s a professional,’ said Deila. ‘Both of them are older and maybe brighter, as well. ‘It’s not going to be any problem. Of course, I’m the manager and it’s Scott and me who are going to have the most important dialogue. ‘I’ve spoken with some of the players and Scott was one of them as he is the captain of the team. He is a very important player for us and knows the club well. He’s looking forward to coming back, starting training and doing well for Celtic. Accepted: Collins and Brown have had disagreements in the past but are said to be happy to work together . ‘The players are also excited to know the new manager and who he is. It’s important I talked with some of the leaders in the group so they feel they are being seen and that I give them something.’ Deila is delighted to have Collins on board as he begins to shape his plans for Celtic, with John Kennedy also set for a backroom role. ‘He (Collins) is going to be my right hand,’ said Deila, who left Stromsgodset to take over at Parkhead 13 days ago. Key: Brown celebrates last season's SPL title win with the fans - and will be expecting the same this season . ‘He’s going to be involved a lot in everything we do and we’re going to talk about football, how we like to play. I need a good staff around me and he’s one of them. We also have a physical coach, scouting and so on. Everybody has to come in and feel a part of it. ‘In the beginning, John Kennedy is going to be a part of it. He’s a boy who has talent and he’s part of the club, what position we don’t know yet. I’m delighted he’s here. He gives me energy when I talk with him and that’s good.’ History: Collins is a former Celtic player and is highly regarded by new manager Ronny Delia .","Brown was part of Hibs squad that led a revolt against Collins in in 2007 .

"By . Corey Charlton . One man's hobby has led to a series of explosive pictures capturing some of the most stormy conditions to rock the US. The incredible photographs show the visual impact of lightning as giant bolts can be seen striking the Arizona landscape and dominating the skyline. U.S.-born technician, Steven Maguire, 49, . is a daring storm-chaser in his spare time – and he describes the . pictures he took of the lightning strikes captured in Arizona. Technician and storm chaser Steven Maguire captured the incredible images in the state of Arizona during some of the most stormy conditions to hit the country . 'Most people see just a storm image, what I see is the beauty of what the storm delivers in a very split second in time,' he said. 'I scout locations during the off season looking for different views that I think would be interesting to photograph. 'Then when the storms start to develop I already have an idea of where I want to set up for the shot.' By scouting locations during the off season, he is better prepared for the shots. He then waits for the forecasts to indicate a storm is brewing before going into action . The state of Arizona has monsoon season thunderstorms and chasing them is a risky business. An average of 51 people die every year from lightning strikes in the US . The remarkable pictures capture moments that are only visible for milliseconds when seen by the naked eye - what Mr Maguire calls the storm's 'beauty' The University of Arizona states that one cloud-to-ground lightning strike can generate between 100 million and 1 billion volts and reach temperatures of more than 27,000 degrees. According to the weather service there is an average of 51 deaths a year in the US from lightning strikes. Mr Maguire uses a variety of cameras and lenses to capture the incredible shots. 'I enjoy photography so much that there's always something new to learn every time I go out and shoot,' he said. 'The longest I have been out is anywhere from 30 minutes to 5 hours shooting some storms. 'Sometimes the storm puts you in a place you didn’t expect and you capture a shot that turns out to be a winner. 'There are a lot of frustrating moments when chasing storms. If you are really passionate enough and keep with it, the payoff is worth it.' Mr Maguire said patience was key for getting great photographs while storm chasing. Using weather and forecasting technology, he can ensure he is well prepared . Mr Maguire's daring photography work chasing storms is only a hobby, although one shoot can take him anywhere between 30 minutes and five hours . He said his passion for photography was strong enough that when he finally gets the shot he wants it is worth all the 'frustrating' moments .","Storm chasing hobby leads to remarkable photographs showing lightning strikes blasting the state of Arizona .

"By . Ian Laybourn, Press Association . Bradford forward Chev Walker admits the relegation-threatened Bulls have hit 'rock bottom' but sends out a note of defiance ahead of their game against Hull KR at the Provident Stadium on Friday night. Captain Matt Diskin takes charge of his first match as caretaker coach following the sacking of head coach Francis Cummins and assistant Lee St Hilaire in the wake of Sunday's demoralising 46-18 defeat at Salford. It was the latest twist in a season of woe for the Bulls which began with the deduction of six points for going into administration and leaves them with the unlikely task of needing to win at least five of their last 11 matches to preserve their First Utility Super League status. Where now? Bradford forward Chev Walker admits the relegation-threatened Bulls have hit 'rock bottom' 'Sadly we are used to things going against us but we're not rolling over and calling it quits,' Walker said. 'Obviously confidence is shot at the minute. 'Disko has put his hand up and his first day as coach was good. We had a good session and he delivered his messages and his game plan over to us really well. 'Credit to Disko for doing that. Obviously Lee and Franny were a big part of our group and held us together for so long so it's sad, but as a group we owe it to them and to ourselves to try and get some performances. 'We are trying to gain something to give us that little bit of confidence to move forward.' Cummins paid the price for the below-par performances of his players and the 31-year-old Walker, who had a two-year spell at Hull KR from 2008-09, acknowledged he endured an off day at Salford, which was a sad way to mark his 300th career appearance. 'There is no point looking at the table, we know where we're at,' Walker said. 'We're all striving to be that bit better in what we're doing. Trouble: The Bulls lost to Niall Evalds (centre) and Salford this week and are second bottom in Super League . Paying the price: Head coach Francis Cummins was sacked as they attempt to avoid relegation . 'I know at the weekend I was second guessing over things that I'd normally take for granted. I don't know if it was pressure, it just seemed to be one of them where we fall in a heap. It seems to come down to a lack of trust in your own ability and the situation that we're in.' If Bradford are to pull off 'mission impossible', a win over a weakened Rovers is essential and Walker sees the visit of his old club as a potential life-saver. 'It's a winnable game but we've not been helping ourselves at times,' he said. 'Our backs are completely against the wall now, we are at rock bottom, so we definitely need to come out fighting. 'Regardless of the result, we need to get some confidence back, and hopefully off the back of that the performances and wins will come. 'Hull KR are in a similar boat to ourselves. They've got a decent enough squad to be able to play well but they are a bit hit and miss. It should be a good battle between two teams looking for a bit of momentum.' Rovers have slipped out of the top eight after conceding 88 points in their last two matches, and former Bradford favourite Jamie Langley joined fellow forwards Justin Poore, Kevin Larroyer and Jordan Cox on the sidelines with a season-ending knee injury sustained in last Friday's home defeat by Warrington. The Robins beat the Bulls 16-0 at home in March but coach Craig Sandercock, who is in talks over a new contract, admits the change of coach makes Bradford dangerous opponents. 'I am disappointed for Francis as a coach but when teams change coaches there always seems to be one or two weeks where they really up the ante,' Sandercock said. 'On paper they have a good squad and at their home ground they are always tough to play against so we are under no illusions.'","Chev Walker admits they have a tough job on their hands .

"By . Karel Janicek, Associated Press . Justin Gatlin remained unbeaten this season by winning the 100 metres at the Golden Spike meet on Tuesday, clocking 9.86 seconds to improve his own world-leading time of the year. Gatlin pulled away from the rest of the field from the start, easing to his eighth victory of the year despite facing a head wind of 0.4 meters per second. Gatlin had promised to 'do something very special' at the meet, which is part of the IAAF World Challenge series. Poser: Justin Gatlin stops for a snap with fans after winning the men's 100m race .

""I was looking for a better time but I'm very happy with it.' Gatlin had set the previous world-leading time of 9.87 at the Beijing World Challenge meet last month. In a 1-2 finish for the United States, Mike Rodgers came second in 10.08 ahead of veteran Kim Collins of St. Kitts and Nevis, who was third in 10.12. Gatlin came to Ostrava to replace Usain Bolt, the Olympic and world champion who announced this month he would skip the Golden Spike and a Diamond League meet in Paris on July 5 because he was behind with his training following a foot injury. Gatlin was the only sprinter to beat Bolt last year, edging him at the line in the 100 in Rome last June, but was beaten by him at the worlds two months later.

Gatlin, the 2004 Olympic champion, said he doesn't plan to compete at the U.S. championships this year but planned to return to Europe to 'run some fast races ... hopefully to get to the low 9.7s, maybe high 9.6s.' Americans were also fast in some other track events at the Golden Spike. LaShawn Merritt dominated the men's 400 with a time of 44.16, with Isaac Makwala of Botswana coming in second in 44.83 while Briton Martyn Rooney was third in 45.03. In the women's 200, U.S. sprinter Allyson Felix proved she's getting back to her top form after collapsing on the track with a torn hamstring at last year's worlds. 'It's a bit weird for me to reach a perfect shape after my injury,' said Felix, who clocked 22.75. 'The wind here disturbed me a bit.'

Raphael Holzdeppe of Germany, who upset Lavillenie at last year's worlds, finished sixth after clearing 5.53. In other events, world indoor champion Caleb Ndiku of Kenya looked strong in the men's 3,000, clocking a world-leading 7:31.66, and Jamaica's Hansle Parchment pulled ahead in the final meters to win the men's 110 hurdles in 13.18. He edged Pascal Martinot-Lagarde France who was second in 13.28, while Xie Wenjun of China was third in 13.37.","Gatlin wins 100 metres at Golden Spike meet in Czech Republic .

"By . Mike Dawes . Former Sussex bowler Naveed Arif has been handed a life ban from cricket by the England and Wales Cricket Board after pleading guilty to six breaches of its anti-corruption code. All of the charges related to Sussex’s Clydesdale Bank 40 match against Kent in August 2011. Arif is now banned from taking part in any form of cricket sanctioned by the ECB, the International Cricket Council or any other national cricket federation. ECB chief executive David Collier said: 'Today’s announcement sends out a very clear message that the ECB has a zero-tolerance approach to corruption in cricket and that it will root out and punish those who pose a threat to the game’s integrity.' Forbidden: Naveed Arif has been given a life ban by the ECB for six breaches of its anti-corruption code . Reports last month stated Arif was under investigation from the ECB, who are looking to clamp down on spot-fixing. Arif acknowledged his guilt in taped interviews with the governing body’s anti-corruption unit, as well as signed statements, and has accepted his punishment. Collier added he hopes the ban will serve as a warning to all cricketers. 'We thank the anti-corruption team for their work in bringing this case and trust that it will serve as a stark reminder to all players of the dangers that corrupt activities pose to their careers and livelihoods,' he said. Arif, a left-arm seamer who also represented Pakistan ‘A’, joined Sussex in time for the 2011 campaign, spending two seasons with the south coast county. He made 11 appearances for them in the LV= County Championship, 13 in the CB40 and six in the Friends Life t20 before it was announced he would be released in September 2012 after falling down the pecking order at Hove. Arif expressed his regret and apologised for his actions, admitting he had no excuses. Guilty: Arif's (far right) charges relate to his time playing for Sussex County Cricket Club in 2011 . A statement via his solicitors said: 'Mr Arif regrets his conduct which has let himself, his team-mates, Sussex County Cricket Club and the cricket fraternity down. 'He is deeply ashamed of his actions and, consequently, bringing the game of cricket into disrepute. These actions were unacceptable and Mr Arif has no excuses. 'Being banned from cricket, the game he loves, is the most severe punishment he could receive. Mr Arif is currently considering his future, having learnt some painful lessons from his past.'","Naveed Arif given life ban from cricket by the England and Wales Cricket Board .

"By . Oliver Todd . Andy Murray should play without the weight of the nation's expectation heavy on his shoulders when he walks out at Wimbledon as defending champion next week, according to former winner Goran Ivanisevic. The 27-year-old Scot returns to the All England Club having become the first British winner since 1936 after beating Novak Djokovic. But Murray is without a tournament win since his triumph at SW19 just under 11 months ago and suffered a shock early exit at Queen's Club last week after a crushing defeat to Rafael Nadal in the French Open semi-finals. Baying crowds: Becoming Britain's first male Wimbledon winner since 1936 will reduce the pressure on Murray . Murray broke down in tears when he was runner-up against Roger Federer on grass two years ago, such was the sense of occasion. But Ivanisevic, Wimbledon champion in 2001 after being given a wildcard entry, believes that last year's win will see a very different player take to Centre Court on Monday afternoon. 'First of all, Andy Murray will have the privilege to open the Championships, and he has deserved it,' said Ivanisevic, who helped launch IMG’s BNP Paribas Tennis Classic at Hurlingham on Tuesday. New ideas: Murray shares a laugh with Amelie Mauresmo who will hope to guide him to a second title at SW19 . 'There will be less pressure for him this time because he did it last year and deserved it last year because he was the best player over the two weeks. 'I have no idea if he is going to win again this year but there will be much less pressure on him - he has already won Wimbledon and nobody can say anything to him anymore. 'Of course if he does not win it again this year, he will be disappointed, but he can always go home and say ""I am Wimbledon champion"", and nobody can take that away from him.' Frustration: Murray has been out of sorts since his injury problems and crashed out of Queen's early . Emotion: Murray finally won the tennis' oldest tournament last year after losing in the 2012 final . Ivanisevic, who never got the chance to defend his title at SW19 because of injury, added: 'However, he is too good a player not to win it again, whether it will be this year or next year, who knows, but his form is picking up now after the injury. 'Already in Paris, he hit the ball much better and I think he is going to be ready.' Much has been made of Murray’s decision to appoint Amelie Mauresmo - the former world number one and 2006 Wimbledon women’s singles champion - as his coach after parting company with Ivan Lendl. Name on the trophy: Murray is fully focused on reaching peak form ahead of the defence of his title . The pair only started working together after Murray’s run to the semi-final of the French Open, where he lost to Rafael Nadal. It remains to be seen what the partnership will bring, with Murray having lost against Radek Stepanek in his second match at the Aegon Championships in Queen’s last week. Ivanisevic, 42, now works as coach for compatriot Marin Cilic, and sees no reason why Mauresmo should not make an impact on Murray’s game. Take two: Ivanisevic says Murray will definitely become Wimbledon champion again - potentially this year . 'It is not like Andy has just chosen a woman, Mauresmo was a Grand Slam winner, she was world number one, an amazing tennis player and is a great person,' said Ivanisevic, who watched Cilic play Kyle Edmund in Thursday’s warm-up event in west London. 'If it is working, then people will be saying ""well done Andy, what a great choice"". If it is not working, then they are going to give him a hard time. 'I hope it goes well, because Amelie is a great girl and an amazing tennis player, so we will see - I think it might work.' Ivanisevic continued: '(As a coach) you do feel a bit frustrated (from the stands), but you have to stay positive - if he looks at you and you make stupid faces, you do not help anybody. 'I was a tennis player, so I know how it feels. I just have to be there and support him, always be positive and so far it is working well.' Masterplan: Mauresmo's coaching for the grass game could be key to Murray's chances, says Ivanisevic . Murray is scheduled to play at IMG’s BNP Paribas Tennis Classic on Thursday, while Friday’s action at Hurlingham is also set to include world number one Nadal, the 2014 French Open champion. Ivanisevic believes the competition will help fine tune preparations for the All England Club. 'It is important for the guys to have a match, to feel the grass, because it is not the same with just practice, and this event here at Hurlingham, with the crowd, it is not like a tournament, but you feel more serious and feel more pressure,' Ivanisevic said. 'The grass here is great, okay you cant get like Wimbledon, but it is a perfect event.' Passing shot: Murray surrendered his Queen's title against Paul-Heri Mathieu last week in the second round .","Past winner Ivanisevic says Murray's first title will make his job easier .

"By . Emily Crane . A Brisbane man has been fined for engaging in a sex act with a 15-year-old girl who was forced to work as a prostitute before and after school by her Thai mother. Queensland District Court judge Richard Jones imposed the 'very lenient' $1,500 fine on the 63-year-old man on Thursday. The man hadn't solicited the act in October 2010 and had initially thought it was the girl's mother he was with, a court heard. A Brisbane man has been fined for engaging in a sex act with a 15-year-old girl (picture posed by model) who was forced to work as a prostitute before and after school by her Thai mother . The mother, a prostitute from Thailand, had told her long-standing clients the girl was her 19-year-old sister or cousin. The girl was living with her grandparents in Thailand when her mother brought her to Australia for a holiday in 2004. During the six-week stay, the nine-year-old girl was taught massage and a number of sex acts. 'It is a case that is almost impossible to comprehend for normal people... That a mother would, in such a perverse way, corrupt a young daughter from such a very early age'- Queensland District Court judge Richard Jones . Two years later, the mother brought the child to Australia permanently to work as a prostitute out of their Runcorn house, in Brisbane's south. The girl worked before and after school, and was abused or starved if she complained. 'It is a case that is almost impossible to comprehend for normal people,' Justice Jones said. 'That a mother would, in such a perverse way, corrupt a young daughter from such a very early age.' The girl, now 19, went to authorities in 2011. During a house raid, police found photos and more than $200,000 cash in a safe. The man had been seeing the girl's mother for five years but never knew her daughter was acting against her will. The man hadn't solicited the act in October 2010 and had initially thought it was the girl's mother he was with, Queensland District Court heard . Police believe the threats were delivered in front of clients in Thai, and the teenager never let on. The man pleaded guilty and had shown remorse and shame, the court heard. Justice Jones didn't record a conviction so the man can visit his son who lives in the United States. 'I have treated you very leniently, so suggest you don't come back to this court again,' he said. The mother was sentenced to nine years in jail in 2013 for child trafficking and will be eligible for parole in three years.

"By . Emily Crane . The competition watchdog is taking Virgin Australia and Jetstar to court, accusing them of slugging customers with hidden fees when buying cheap airfares online. The airlines are alleged to have engaged in 'drip pricing', where a headline price is advertised but extra fees and charges are introduced during the booking process. The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) has launched separate Federal Court proceedings against Virgin and Jetstar, with the airlines facing hefty fines and orders to change their advertising practices. The competition watchdog is taking Virgin Australia and Jetstar to court, accusing them of slugging customers with hidden fees when buying cheap airfares online . Jetstar said it will defend the allegations, while Virgin is reviewing the ACCC's proceedings and considering its options. Jetstar is alleged to have failed to inform customers they would be charged a booking fee of $8.50 per passenger when they paid online with a credit card. Virgin allegedly includes a booking fee of $7.70 for those paying with a credit card, debit card or via PayPal. The airlines are alleged to have engaged in 'drip pricing', where a headline price is advertised but extra fees and charges are introduced during the booking process . 'The ACCC alleges that these fees applied to the substantial majority of online bookings and should have been disclosed upfront and prominently with or within headline prices,' the watchdog said. Jetstar said it offers airline seats at the lowest price, and then optional extras - including fees for a particular way of booking. 'The booking and service fee is clearly disclosed and the total price that people pay is shown before they finalise their purchase,' a Jetstar spokesperson said. The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission chairman Rod Sims said the watchdog was investigating similar 'drip pricing' behaviour by businesses in other industries after Federal Court proceedings were launched against Virgin and Jetstar . 'Our customers have the option to choose one of four fee-free payment methods and that's how a large number of them book.' Virgin said all Australian airlines have long charged separate booking and service fees and its customers are also offered fee-free payment options. More...

"By . Sarah Dean . Mobile phone users across Australia have vented their anger after two of the country's largest mobile phone networks crashed. Customers were unable to make phone calls or send text messages when Vodafone and Optus suffered a major technical glitch called a 'failed transmission link' on Thursday. The issue also spread to customers using Amaysim and Virgin Mobile, as they are part of the Optus network. Frustrated Vodafone customers took to Facebook to express their anger. Jarrod Rudd wrote: 'I absolutely hope I get compensated for my problems that I cannot rectify, which are your company's fault because your lines are down.' Fail: Both Vodafone (left) and Optus (right) suffered problems on Thursday leaving customers fuming . Vanessa Rasmussen Bettina fumed: 'We pay for a service... Constant outages and then having to call to get them to compensate me is insulting. If it's not working we should not be paying.' A post on Vodafone's Facebook page around lunchtime said: 'Hi everyone, we've just had confirmation that we're currently experiencing some network issues. We're working to restore these issues as soon as possible and we'll keep you updated throughout in this thread.' But by 3.15pm a resolution had still not been found and a post on Vodafone's website said: 'No further updates at this stage. We'll update you again as soon as we have more information to share.' A Vodafone spokeswoman told MailOnline their service was back up and running after 4pm. The company is unsure how many people were affected because the outage was 'intermittent'. The spokeswoman explained: 'At times some people could make and receive calls.' Optus used social media to update its customers about its problems . Advice: The telecommunications company asked customers to turn their phones on and off . Meanwhile, Optus advised customers via Twitter this afternoon to turn their phones on and off to fix the problem. 'Those customers affected, please turn your phone off & then on. This should fix the problem. We apologise again for the inconvenience,' they wrote. Earlier in the day they said: 'We are aware of an issue affecting some Optus customers at the moment. We're currently investigating the problem and will keep you updated.' Vodafone service first dropped out in Western Australia this morning and then customers on the east coast also began to experience major difficulties. An Optus spokesperson told MailOnline on Thursday evening: 'We're currently trying to see who is back up and running.' 'Network issues': Vodafone used Facebook to communicate with their customers but were not able to give much information during the day . She explained that the company did not know what caused the outage. They also weren't sure whether the Optus outage was related to the Vodafone outage. In a statement they added: 'We are investigating the cause of an issue that is affecting the mobile services of some of our customers. 'We are working on the issue as a priority and will provide an update as soon as possible.

"By . Daniel Mills . The first pictures of one of the world's rarest sea creatures, Migaloo the white humpback whale, have been taken of the magnificent animal beginning his yearly migration north along Australia's eastern seaboard. The all-white Migaloo who shares his distinguishable albino appearance with just one other white whale in the world, a Norwegian, was sighted for the first time this year by a member of the public just off the coast of Green Cape in southern NSW on Tuesday. He was then spotted several times again on Thursday, with camera crews getting magnificent views of the 35-year-old off the coast of Sydney. He was snapped and filmed breaching in waters off Botany Bay, Cronulla and Bondi as Australia's much-loved white whale continued his three-month migratory trip from Antarctica to North Queensland and back. Scroll down for video . Photographer Jonas Liebschner shot this stunning picture of Migaloo as he surfaced near the boat of Whale Watching Sydney at Cronulla in Sydney's south on Thursday afternoon . Migaloo was swimming in a 'competition pod' with four other Humpback whales as they tried to jostle one another for the leading position while heading north through Sydney . It is the 23rd consecutive year Migaloo has been spotted on the eastern seaboard, his first being in 1991 when he was sighted by marine biologist Dan Burns off the coast off Byron Bay. By Friday he will have made his way north of Newcastle, before reaching Queensland at the end of the month. He is being joined by others from the Australian East Coast Humpback whale population, leaving the cool waters of the Antarctic behind in search of Queensland's tropical warm paradise. Photographer Jonas Liebschner was on scene to snap Migaloo during his first movements through Sydney.  Mr Leibschner was tipped off by whale station volunteers at Botany Bay that Migaloo and a pod of other humpbacks were swimming a few hundred metres off shore in what's known as a 'competition pod.' 'They try to swim as fast as they can and jostle for the dominant position, zig-zagging underwater,' he told Daily Mail Australia. Usually restricted to a minimum of 150 metres from Migaloo, Mr Liebschner and his team from Whale Watching Sydney got closer than they anticipated because of the pods erratic underwater behaviour. He said his crew were forced to the boat's engine off and idle near the whales which surfaced closer to the boat than expected. Migaloo, just one of two white humpback whales in the world, breaches in the foreground with a stunning afternoon backdrop of Sydney's CBD behind him . Mr Liebschner was on Migaloo watch on Thursday, first heading to Bondi at 6.30am, before receiving a call from a whale station at Botany Bay to inform he and his whale watching team that Migaloo was further south . Migaloo is only part way into his three month winter journey from Antarctica to North Queensland in search of warmer water . The best places to catch Migaloo this week will be Newcastle and Nelson Bay, north of Sydney on Friday, before makes his journey north to Cape Byron where he was first spotted by a marine biologist 23 years ago . Australian laws exist whereby planes and sea craft are prohibited from entering a certain zone when photographing or filming Migaloo. Founder of the White Whale Research Centre Oskar Peterson, who has been tracking the albino's movements since he was first spotted in the early 90s, told Daily Mail Australia why. Mr Peterson, who also runs a blog dedicated purely to the 'fascinating' sea creature, said Migaloo survived a run-in with a trimaran or outrigger boat which left him with significant black scarring on his lower back. The close shave meant tougher laws were brought in to protect the rare animal who has a life expectancy of 80. 'Planes have to stay at least 2000 feet from him and 500 feet if you are travelling in a boat,' Mr Peterson said. Oskar Peterson excitedly tweeted to his followers about Migaloo's first Australian sighting for the 2104 migratory season . Cronulla, Botany Bay and Bondi were some of the areas around Sydney where Migaloo was spotted on Thursday . Members of the public were more than interested in getting a glimpse of the famous white whale . Mr Peterson also took to twitter on Thursday afternoon to spread the good news that Migaloo was in Sydney. 'Attention Sydney whale watchers. Migaloo was just sighted off Cronulla 30 minutes ago, heading north towards Bondi, enjoy!' The researcher runs his pet, not-for-profit blog full of facts, photos and other tidbits about Australia's much-loved sea creature. The site, migaloo.com.au, is used predominantly as an education tool for school children. 'I've had quite a lot of money offered for the website, but I use it as an educational site mainly for school kids who send me plenty of emails at this time of year.' As well as receiving countless school children's emails, Mr Peterson is also inundated with great images and updates of Migaloo's three-month round journey from Antarctica and back between late June and September.","Amazing pictures of rare white whale swimming north off coast of Sydney .

"By . Freya Noble . Industrial action may be taken by staff at the Australian Tax Office if a proposed extension to their working day goes ahead. Formal action is yet to be taken, but on Monday afternoon the ATO is expected to put forward a proposal that could require workers to be at their desks for an additional nine minutes each day, for no additional pay. A spokeswoman for the ATO told the MailOnline that 'the day ends at 4.51 according to enterprise agreement.' Staff at the Australia Tax Office could have their work days extended from 4.51pm to 5pm . The spokeswoman said this is due to the fact that core working hours are stated as 7.21 per day in the agreement. However, Jeff Lapidos, secretary of the Australian Services Union branch that represents workers at the ATO told the MailOnline they are 'strongly opposed' to any push from the Government that could see staff finishing closer to 5pm. He said the extra minutes staff could be asked to work per day 'is equivalent to cutting five and third days in annual leave per year'. The ATO spokeswoman said they are keeping staff informed and currently working through a range of options. 'The ATO will negotiate in good faith with the CPSU, the ASU and individual employee representatives on its enterprise agreement. According to the ATO enterprise agreement, the working day currently ends at 4.51pm . 'We will be discussing a range of employment conditions as part of that process, but as part of our commitment to good faith bargaining we will not be publicly commenting on the negotiations prior to bargaining discussions.' There are many hoops the unions need to jump through before industrial action can be taken, but Mr Lapidos said it was unlikely the ATO would change their minds unless they put up a big fight. 'Industrial action can't be taken in the immediate future as the fair work act lays down a process to be followed. '(But) they have little incentive to change their position if they [the unions] don't take action.' 'The last time they tried this was in 2006 and we campaigned strongly against it then, and the tax office withdrew their position.' On Monday afternoon the ATO are expected to formally hand down proposed changes . Mr Lapidos also said there would be no compromise from the union on working hours, and the government was trying to implement the changes for their own benefit. 'The government isn't prepared to share the productivity savings which are expected from the tax office over the next few years.' 'The purpose behind that from their perspective is to finance a minimal pay rise.' The exact proposed changes will be formally revealed early next week, and if the tax office aren't prepared to cooperate industrial action could take place in the coming months.","The Australian Tax Office are expected to extend the working day beyond its current end at 4.51pm .

Cleo was saved from the Gypsy Jokers outlaw motorcycle gang clubhouse in Sydney, on Wednesday, after police raided the venue. The brown female Alpaca was being kept in a paddock at the rear of the building. She was allegedly stolen from a property in Bringelly, NSW, in February and the RSPCA are now hoping to reunite her with her real owners. Saved: Cleo the Alpaca was rescued from a bikie gang clubhouse in Sydney on Wednesday . An RSPCA spokesperson told MailOnline: 'She was found in pretty good condition. The vets have had a good look over her and there are no broken bones or anything.' 'She's just in our animal shelter at the moment, it's got paddocks and stables and she's living with a couple of very cute baby goats called Ben and Billy,' she added. But Cleo wasn't the only thing police scooped during the dramatic raid. They also seized a loaded .32 calibre revolver, a loaded pistol and approximately 700 rounds of ammunition. And officers discovered more than 200 tablets, believed to be MDMA, in the bolt hole. The Gypsy Jokers motorcycle gang, who originally formed in San Francisco, California on April Fool's Day, 1956, are one of the most notorious and violent motorcycle gangs in both the US and in Australia. Loaded: Police seized a .32 calibre revolver, a pistol and approximately 700 rounds of ammunition from the Gypsy Jokers clubhouse in Sydney . In 2008, police forced the Gypsy Jokers to dismantle its clubhouse fortifications in Perth. The gang had set-up a concrete front wall, surveillance cameras and modified doors on the building and claimed the security was needed in the area as the burglary rate was high. Investigators from the Gangs Squad's Strike Force Raptor are investigating Wednesday's findings and police expect to make arrests. The seizure of the items comes during Operation Unification, a joint initiative involving police agencies from across Australia, which is focused on getting illicit firearms out of the hands of criminals.

"By . Amanda Williams . Mother-of-two Janine Mallett drowned on an Ibiza beach after ingesting ecstasy and cocaine, an inquest has heard . A mother-of-two found dead on an Ibiza beach with high levels of ecstasy and cocaine in her body had been warned by her husband to stay away from drugs, an inquest has heard. Janine Mallett was found on S’Arenal beach on the Spanish island on July 6 last year. Teesside Magistrates’ Court heard that the 31-year-old had drowned after losing consciousness - and a pathologist said there was evidence of 'voluntary ingestion of cocaine, MDMA (ecstasy), amphetamine and methamphetamine'. But Mrs Mallett’s husband Iain told the inquest that his wife was . 'completely anti-drugs' - and that he had warned her about drugs being 'in her face' on the party island. And the court heard conflicting statements from friend Aimee Owens, a student at Teesside University, who went on holiday with Mrs Mallett - one which confirmed the pair had taken drugs, and one which said they had not. The . first was given to Spanish police - which Ms Owens says was taken by an officer who spoke poor English. She said it was written in Spanish and not read . out to her before she signed it. In . this statement, Ms Owens said that her and Mrs Mallett had been . drinking vodka and lemonade poolside at their hotel, the Club Maritimo . in Ibiza, before going out in San Antonio. While out, the statement said the pair bought a light pink ecstasy tablet from a man for 10 euros, and took half each. Later, they bought two dark pink, slightly smaller, ecstasy tablets from an African man for 15 euros. They took half of one each, and both later took the other half. Mrs Mallett was found on S'Arenal beach on the Spanish island on July 6 last year. Teesside Magistrates' Court heard medical evidence that the 31-year-old had died from drowning . However . in a second statement given back in England on March 15, 2014, Ms Owens . claimed tthat Mrs Mallett had not taken any drugs at all. A . pathology report conducted in England by Dr Nigel Cooper at the . University Hospital of North Tees on July 18 concluded that Mrs Mallett, . of in Thornaby, had high levels of MDMA in her system and had died as a . result of drowning, or from the effects of MDMA. This report also found alcohol and traces of cocaine. Ms Owens - who was carrying Mrs Mallett’s shoes and handbag - said she had lost sight of Mrs Mallett near the beach. Ms Owens said she looked for her, before getting a taxi back to their hotel and waiting up and searching the area. She searched again the next morning, but reported Mrs Mallett missing to the hotel reception at around 11.30am. Shortly after, two paramedics came to the hotel and asked Ms Owens if her friend had a tattoo on her hip and piercings - before they confirmed her friend had been found dead in the sea at around 10.45am. Mrs Mallett was described during the inquest as a 'very special lady' who was devoted to her family. But Mrs Mallett's husband Iain, told the inquest that he warned his wife that drugs would be 'in her face' and that she was 'completely anti-drugs' In a statement, Mr Mallett said: 'She was one of those special people who lit up a room.' Mr Mallett’s statement described how his wife had not wanted to go on the holiday and leave their two children, Jack and Evelyn, who were five and three at the time. 'I talked her into going because she never did anything for herself, she only thought of her family. He said that his wife had never taken recreational drugs in her life and was 'very anti-drugs' as well as being anti-smoking - even making him give up cigarettes when they first met. Mrs Mallett drank alcohol occasionally but was a responsible drinker. The inquest also heard that Mrs Mallett, who had been made redundant from her job as a team leader at a call centre, had been volunteering as a teaching assistant at a local school after completing a college course. Mrs Mallett never received the news that staff at the school were set to offer her a paid job. Before she went away she left a note reminding her husband to look after their children, Jack and Evelyn before signing it off saying: 'I just want to tell you how much I love you and I'm going to miss you like crazy.' Acting Coroner Clare Bailey recorded an open verdict. She said: 'I am prepared to accept the medical opinion. 'No evidence has been provided for Mrs Mallett taking the drugs. We also have no evidence explaining her movements from when she was last seen to when her body was found. 'We cannot say how she ingested the drugs or what steps led to her being found in the water.'","Janine Mallett was found on S’Arenal beach on the Spanish island on July 6 .

"By . Ellie Zolfagharifard . and Associated Press . Digital currency Bitcoin is built on the premise that it exists outside the control of any centralised power. But now it is in danger of losing this credibility because of the growing power of a group that runs some of the computers behind it. In recent weeks, a London-based 'mining pool' called GHash has amassed nearly half of the Bitcoin computing power and has briefly gone over 50 per cent. In recent weeks, mining group GHash has amassed nearly half of the Bitcoin computing power and has briefly gone over 50 per cent.

Bitcoin is a distributed peer-to-peer . digital currency that functions without any central authority, such as . the Bank of England. The currency was launched in 2008 and is traded within a global network of computers. Miners operate the computers that keep . track of bitcoins and create additional coins. They pool their computing . power to spread the financial risk of their operations. Bitcoins can be bought with near anonymity, which supporters say lowers fraud risk and increases privacy. But critics say that also makes bitcoins a magnet for drug transactions, money-laundering and other illegal activities. The value of bitcoins has fallen six per . cent in a week to around $600 (£354) as the threat posed by GHash has . become clearer, although the decline is within the range of normal . fluctuations for the volatile currency. A . bitcoin investor, Norwegian Kristoffer Koch, recently made more than . half a million pounds after he forgot he bought £17 of currency four . years. This means GHash could, in theory, control the flow of transactions, freeze people out of the network and keep all future bitcoins for itself. Although GHash says it's committed to preserving Bitcoin as a trustable technology, the mere fact that one player can amass majority control could undermine trust in the currency, which is worth only what people are willing to pay for it. The value of bitcoins has fallen six per cent in a week to around $600 (£354) as the threat posed by GHash has become clearer, although the decline is within the range of normal fluctuations for the volatile currency.

Bitcoins have also become a target of speculators betting on a continued run-up in the currency. Its value has grown a hundredfold over two years. From a technical standpoint, bitcoins are sequences of numbers, painstakingly produced by computers churning through millions of calculations.

A single mining computer might take years to produce a single block of coins, and there's no way to know when that might happen. In pools, miners divide the bitcoins they create among themselves in proportion to the work done, providing with them with a steadier stream of income. The pools aren't created to threaten the trust placed in bitcoin; it's a side effect of the pool's growth. GHash is controlled by a British company, CEX.IO Ltd. The company said in a statement Monday that it wants to protect Bitcoin, but it doesn't want to turn away people from the pool or impose other temporary solutions to back away from the 50 per cent threshold. GHash said it's arranging a 'round table' meeting of key players in the Bitcoin system in July to 'with the aim of discussing and negotiating collectively ways to address the decentralisation of mining as an industry.'

"By . Sarah Griffiths . Tesco is challenging Skype's dominance by launching its own cheap international calling app (pictured) The cost of calling home from abroad has plummeted in recent years thanks to services such as Skype. And prices could be set to fall even lower as Tesco is challenging the voice-over-IP service’s dominance with its own low cost international calling app. The Tesco Calling Card app is available for iPhone and Android handsets and offers international calls for as little as two pence a minute. Holiday makers and football fans visiting Brazil for the World Cup, for example, would pay just 60p for 30 minutes, when using the app. Tesco said a comparable length chat from a hotel in São Paulo would cost around £60. A half-hour call from Spain using the app would cost just 30p, compared to a hotel phone in the Costa Del Sol, which the company said would cost £14.50. The app can also be used to call overseas from the UK from just 1p per minute. ‘The new app offers an even more convenient and cost effective way to keep in touch with loved ones over the summer, whether that be from the sun lounger to back home, or from the sofa in the UK to family living overseas,’ said Tesco. Users can earn £1 credit for downloading the app and £2 for referring friends. They can also make calls and send messages app-to-app for free. The Tesco Calling Card app is available . for iPhone and Android handsets and offers international calls, to any number, for as . little as two pence a minute using a Wi-Fi connection. The app also lets people make calls and send messages app-to-app (pictured right) free of charge . Tesco Calling Card can also be used by people without a smartphone as they can buy traditional cards worth £5, £10 or £20 in the supermarket, which they can then use on holiday. The cards are valid for 90 days after purchase or topping up. While Skype and Tesco’s services both require an internet connection to work, an app called Ringo is offering calls between countries for up to 25 per cent less than Skype, using submarine cables. This means the app bypasses expensive carrier call costs, doesn’t ask people to turn on roaming data and the firm claims is typically 25 per cent cheaper than Skype. But the app does not have such a large geographical spread, as users can call from 16 countries. Holiday makers (stock image pictured) and football fans visiting Brazil for the World Cup, for example, would pay just 60p for 30 minutes, when using the app. Tesco said a comparable length chat from a hotel in São Paulo would cost around £60 . Tesco's new app could also be put to a more novel use as a survey has found that millions of besotted cat owners stay in touch with their pets by calling home to 'speak' to them. One in three use video messaging service Skype to see and give them attention, a poll of 1,000 owners by Hallmark claims. A quarter of male owners admit they’ll even call home just to hear their feline friend purring - more than the number of women who do. While more companies are entering the low cost international calls market in new ways, Skype is trying to stay ahead of the game. Microsoft has unveiled its new Skype Translator technology that it says can decode languages in real-time. It means that during video calls the speech recognition software will allow two callers from different countries to talk with ease. Around 300 million people use Skype and two billion minutes of conversation are spoken every day, so Tesco has some catching up to do before it rivals the VoIP giant.","Tesco's Calling Card app is available for iPhone and Android handsets .

"By . Emily Crane . The daughter of one of two elderly women murdered in their northern NSW nursing home has spoken of her heartache as police continue the hunt for their killer. Marie Darragh, 82 and Isobella Spencer, 77, were found unconscious in their beds on May 10 by staff at St Andrews Village nursing home in Ballina. Police have confirmed they are 'looking at the actions of all nursing home staff' in relation to the deaths and are examining what medications the elderly residents were given. Scroll down for video . Marie Darragh, 82, was one of two women found unconscious in their beds on May 10 by staff at St Andrews Village nursing home in Ballina . Ms Darragh, who was on the brink of death when she moved to the Ballina nursing home three years ago, managed to turn her health around after she quit smoking. Her daughter, Janet Parkinson, said her mother's new-found health and happiness made the suspected murder so much harder to deal with. 'It's total heartbreak,' Ms Parkinson said on Thursday. 'Because when she went in there she was ready to die. She was so frail and it has taken them three and a half years to get her where she was. 'They built her up and she had to go this way ... that's the heartbreaking thing.' Ms Darragh's daughter, Charli Matterson, told the ABC her mum had lived at the home for three years and was healthy at the time she died . The women were pronounced dead before paramedics arrived just before Mother's Day. A third elderly woman at the nursing home was attacked on the same night but survived. She is understood to be helping police with their investigation and her name has not been released. The nursing home said she is in good health and is back at the facility after a stint in hospital. Detectives believe they have a good idea how both women died and have questioned nursing home staff. 'Obviously we are looking at the actions of staff members that night. However, we are keeping an open mind,' Detective Superintendent Mick Willing said on Wednesday. 'The fact that these deaths occurred in unexpected circumstances on the same night, in the same location, prompted an immediate response from homicide investigators.' Ms Parkinson said she had her own suspicions about what happened, but could not speak highly enough of the nursing home staff. 'Obviously I have missed something,' she said. Ms Darragh, a grandmother to 11 and mother of three, had 'loved' living at the nursing home, according to her daughter. Ms Darragh was a grandmother to 11 and mother of three including Charli Matterson . Police have not disclosed any further details about the women's deaths but said there was no 'existing threat' at the nursing home. 'I want to make it absolutely clear that we believe this is an isolated incident,' Det Supt Willing said. 'There is nothing to suggest the women's deaths are in any way linked to deaths in other nursing homes.' Det Supt said the management and staff at St Andrews Village nursing home have been very supportive of the detectives managing the case. Police say the killer may have been a staff member at the northern NSW nursing home and detectives have examined what medications the elderly residents were given . The manager of the nursing home, Phillip Carter, said that the cause of the women's deaths was still unknown but that the deaths have 'deeply distressed staff, residents and their families'. 'The police have advised me they do not have conclusive information on the causes of death at this stage,' he said. 'St Andrews acted immediately to involve the police because the deaths were unexpected. 'We understand the pain of losing a loved one and we are doing all we can to assist police.' He also said he knew nothing about the assault on the third woman. 'All I've been told is there's an investigation because of two unexpected deaths. They haven't consulted with me about anyone else being assaulted or tampered with,' he told MailOnline. Police did not disclose any further details about the women's deaths but said there was no 'existing threat' at the nursing home .","Marie Darragh, 82 and Isobella Spencer, 77, were found dead at Ballina nursing home just before Mother's Day on May 10 .

"By . Sarah Dean . and Louise Cheer . Unusual: Funeral organiser Joanne Cummings used air conditioning in her vehicle to preserve a man's body in Western Australia . A pair of funeral directors had to store a body of a 200kg man in their car overnight after a Western Australian hospital rejected the corpse because it was too big. Initially the couple - funeral organiser Jo-Anne Cummings and her partner Gavin Ness - wanted to store the man at Karratha Hospital, but were told by staff it would not fit in the fridge. Last Wednesday when the body was refused, Ms Cummings and Mr Ness had to drive almost 200km from Roebourne to Hedland Health Campus. But on arrival the body was unable to be moved because the equipment to transport it from the car was already being used by another corpse. Ms Cummings said clear communication from Hedland staff could have stopped them driving there and back, with the body in the car. The owners of Pilbara Funeral Services had no other choice but to preserve the man's corpse by using their car's air conditioning. They had to kept the car running throughout the night, burning through three tanks of fuel, until they were able to get a chilling container the next morning to store the body in. 'It was about 8pm when we got to Hedland and then we had turn the car around and go back home with the deceased in the car,' Ms Cummings said. 'We had to check on him every half hour because it was just sitting in the driveway and to keep the temperature down.' A corpse should be kept between 1.5 and 4.5 degrees for the first couple of days. But Ms Cummings said this was not the first incident of its kind. A year ago, the same issue came up and Ms Cummings had alerted health officials to the problem then, but it still had not been addressed. 'The initial incident happened about a year ago and we turned up with a 250kg man at the Hedland Hospital,' she said. 'The hospital services manager took one look at him and basically said he’s too fat he won’t fit in the car in front of two police officers and my husband and myself. 'That's the kind of offhand comment we had to deal with. 'We have a population that is larger and it’s not just going to go away.' Not equipped: A spokesperson for Hedland Health Campus (pictured) said they 'only have equipment for storing bodies weighing up to 150kg' Long journey: Ms Cummings drove to the morgue at Hedland Health Campus, Colebatch Way, South Hedland, she then had to drive to hours back to her home in Roebourne with the body still in the car . Ms Cummings said the hospital's past failure to act was disrespecting the deceased and their family. 'If it was your child or relative in my car, you wouldn’t like that,' she said. 'They go through a rough enough time without having to worry about where to store their body.' Ron Wynn Regional Director WA Country Health Service-Pilbara told MailOnline: 'Currently the Hedland Health Campus only has equipment for storing bodies weighing up to 150kg and is not equipped to transfer bodies in caskets. 'Special arrangements have to be made to store bodies weighing more and for those in caskets,' he said. 'We will investigate installing equipment which has a capacity of up to 300kg.' He also explained that Ms Cummings' arrangement to store bodies at the hospital morgue was on a 'good will' basis. 'The Pilbara Funeral Service does not have body storage facilities in Port Hedland and Karratha and therefore the hospital mortuaries have assisted. However; the Newman funeral director does have storage. Shocking: The body of a 200-kilogram man was kept inside Joanne Cumming's car last Wednesday night after the morgue refused to take it . 'The WA Country Health Service-Pilbara staff will meet with representatives of Pilbara Funeral Services to develop a formal agreement for receiving and storing deceased persons at Hedland Health Campus. This is currently carried out on a good will basis and there is no fee for this service. 'Hedland Health Campus staff have assisted with the transfer and handling of deceased persons from Pilbara Funeral Services and when the Funeral Director has not been available staff have conducted viewings for the deceased’s family,' Mr Wynn said. He added: 'It is imperative that at all times a deceased person is treated with the utmost care and respect and viewings are arranged so as not to cause distress and inconvenience to grieving families. We endeavour to do this in all WA Country Service hospitals.' Ms Cummings was hopeful a positive result would come out of talks with them and the health service.","Joanne Cummings drove almost 200km across WA with corpse in her car .

"Jessica Bradford was diagnosed with cervical cancer at the age of 18 - after doctors told her she had an STI . A teenager told the cervical cancer invading her body was nothing more than an STI is today clinging to hope of one day becoming a mother after doctors froze her eggs. Hairdresser Jessica Bradford visited doctors five times before a correct diagnosis was made, with one GP telling her she was too young to have the disease. The 18-year-old has had 10 of her eggs successfully frozen, after starting aggressive radiotherapy to treat a cancerous growth found on her cervix. But the teenager and her mother Julie Bradford, from Rhymney, are campaigning to lower the age when women are first screened for cervical cancer in the hope more young people will be diagnosed at a early stage. When Jessica noticed abnormal bleeding in December last year, she visited her doctor. The teenager was told she had thrush and was prescribed antibiotics. But when her symptoms persisted, Jessica returned to the doctors. She was diagnosed with a bacterial infection before a GP told the trainee hairdresser her symptoms were most likely the result of a sexually transmitted infection. Taking matters into her own hands, Jessica researched the symptoms online. Fearing her condition was more sinister and suspecting cervical cancer was to blame, Jessica visited her doctors again. But the teenager was told at the age of 18 she was too young to be suffering the disease. A series of tests, scans and biopsies finally confirmed the teenager's worst fears. Jessica is one of the youngest women in Britain to be diagnosed with cervical cancer - women are not normally scanned for it until they are at least 20. But Jessica and her mum, also a hairdresser, are now campaigning for the age to be lowered in the hope that other teenagers could be diagnosed early. In February Jessica received another blow. Doctors at Llandough Hospital in Penarth revealed she would not be able to have a child naturally, due to the aggressive treatment she required. Doctors accelerated her in vitro fertilisation (IVF) procedure to allow for Jessica's eggs to be harvested before her radiotherapy began. She said: 'I have always wanted a big family in the future so I am very pleased that the treatment was successful. 'IVF treatment normally lasts eight weeks but the doctors have given it to me over two weeks.' Jessica and her mother Julie are now doing all they can to raise awareness about the importance of spotting symptoms and going to see a doctor early, following Cervical Screening Awareness Week last week. Cervical Screening Awareness Week (CSAW) s a UK-wide initiative led by Jo’s Cervical Cancer Trust. The trainee hairdresser and her mother Julie Bradford, are calling for the age at which women are first screened for cervical cancer to be lowered from 25. Jessica is today hopeful she will become a mother after doctors harvested 10 of her eggs after revealing the aggressive treatment would leave her infertile . Research released by the Trust shows that 22 per cent of women in the UK still do not attend cervical screenings. Jessica said: 'I would urge young girls who are putting off their routine smear test to go and get it done quickly. 'For girls who have had clear tests but are still worried, I would encourage them to push for more tests until you get a definite answer to put your mind at rest.' 'I would urge young girls who are putting off their routine smear test to go and get it done quickly' - Jessica Bradford . Her mother, Julie added: 'At the first sign of symptoms, Jessica went to a doctor but the scans showed that the growth was already pretty big. 'If she had left it any longer it would have been too late. Jess is strong-minded and she is positive. I am really proud of her.' Cervical cancer screenings are only routinely available on the NHS in Wales for women over the age of 25, an age that Jessica believes should be lowered. She said: 'I want girls to be given smear tests from a younger age so it’s not too late for someone else to be treated. 'I have received such a positive response on social media and think it’s important to raise awareness.'","Jessica Bradford first noticed abnormal bleeding in December last year .

"By . Mark Prigg . Apple is preparing to give the iPad a new split screen mode so users can run two apps at once, it has been claimed. Video showing the feature has been leaked online - at it could be available in the next update of Apple's iOS software. It allows the user to change the window size using a finger. Scroll down for video . The update would allow the iPad to run two apps side by side. The feature is already in the latest beta version of the iPad software, according to one user who uploaded a video of it. The feature allows the iPad screen to be split in two. It is now known how the command will be triggered. Using  two fingers on the screen, the apps can be resized. Each app is able to work independently. It is also expected to be simple to copy data between apps. Expected to be unveiled in September when the firm is expected to unveil new iPhones and iPads, the move will be a major change to the way the iPad handles multiple applications. However, the tablet will not be the first with the feature - and Microsoft even made the iPad's lack of split screen functionality the subject of a recent ad. 'iOS 8 is likely to supercharge the functionality of Apple’s iPad with a new split-screen multitasking feature, according to sources with knowledge of the enhancement in development,' claims the blog 9to5Mac. 'These people say that the feature will allow iPad users to run and interact with two iPad applications at once.' The video shows the iPad simulator software splitting the screen, which can be dragged to resize it. Current users can swap between apps, but can only see one on screen at a time. The new feature is also likely to enable users to drag information - text or pictures, for example, between apps. The blog also claims the feature may also be key to a larger-screened iPad, which Apple is actively developing for a launch either later this year or in 2015.

"By . Mark Branagan . A historic tapestry looted by the Nazis is being returned to its original home by a UK university. The artwork was among three treasures taken from the Normandy home of Count Bernard de la Rochefoucauld when he was arrested in 1943 for Resistance activities. After the war, the Louis XIV tapestry was smuggled into . London and put on the open market. Rightful owner: Deputy Vice Chancellor of the University of Sheffield Professor Paul White (left) with Comte Jacques de la Rochefoucauld, who is taking the tapestry back to his ancestral home in Normandy . Sheffield University bought it in 1959, never dreaming it was one of . three masterpieces looted from count de la Rochefoucauld’s . former home in occupied France. Five decades on, academics decided to trace its origins and discovered that it once held pride of place in the count’s Chateau  de Versainville. They contacted the count’s heirs and said they were sending the tapestry home. The family chateau is being restored by Comte Jacques de la Rochefoucauld, a descendant of Count Bernard’s brother. He said yesterday: ‘I am delighted by this news and touched by the generosity of the University of Sheffield in making so kind a gesture. 'The example that the University has . set is one which I hope others will follow in due course, and . demonstrates their respect for those who have suffered in the past from . the ravages of war. ‘In the year marking the 70th anniversary of the death of Comte Bernard de la Rochefoucauld this donation brings us great happiness.’ Lynne Fox, Sheffield’s heritage officer, said: ‘We are delighted to see the tapestry returned to its rightful home. We were as surprised as anyone to discover the history of the tapestry.’ Historic: The 18th century artwork was returned thanks to the London-based Art Loss Register, the world’s largest privately held database of lost and stolen art with more than 400,000 listings . 'We were as surprised as anyone to . discover the history of the tapestry but have been working extremely . hard to ensure it is returned to the Château where it can be appreciated . in its original home.” The 18th century artwork was returned thanks to the London-based Art Loss Register, the world’s largest privately held database of lost and stolen art with more than 400,000 listings. The London-based register was . established in 1991 to ensure catalogues used by auction houses and . other sellers contain correct information. But it also targets art . thieves. James . Ratcliffe, Director of Recoveries, said: 'It has been a pleasure to . assist in the restoration of this tapestry to its rightful home. 'We . are extremely grateful to the University of Sheffield for their . assistance and generosity. 'It is always satisfying to bring . restitution cases to a conclusion and we hope to locate and recover the . remaining two missing tapestries in due course through our work.' Count Bernard and his wife were both sent to Flossenburg concentration camp in Bavaria where he died two days before D-Day. The count’s body was among the remains of 30,000 victims found when the Allies liberated the camp in April 1945. His wife survived the war.","Count Bernard de la Rochefoucauld owned the work in Normandy, France .

Channel 4 News . carried out in-depth interviews with 76 over-60s all over the country . and polled another 500 to find out about love, sex and relationships. 'It's the secret sex life of your parents and grandparents,' one 70-year-old woman in Somerset told the show. Scroll down for video . New show: Channel 4 News will be airing a new show called Secret Sex Life of Parents and Grandparents, which will reveal all about love, relationships and sex in over 60s . In fact, 51 per cent of people over 60 said they're sexually active and many describe enjoying a late sexual bloom. 'I can say that sometimes in the street I think ""oh yeah, that would be a nice person to go to bed with,""' Vikki, 70, from Dorset told the programme, which is called Love and Sex for the over 60s and airs tonight at 7pm. Joey, 69, from London, added: 'I got to a point where I thought I'm going to kick the bucket fairly soon', so three months ago he joined Grindr, the mobile dating app for gay men revealed: 'I'm averaging, I would say, four men a week.' Despite many feeling liberated in themselves, many said they didn't feel like society was very approving of OAP sex. Virtual love: Stella and Peter, 71, met online and got married a year ago having both lost their long-term partners . Separate lives: Channel 4 News carried out in-depth interviews with 76 over 60s all over the country, including Carol and David, who live apart to keep things fresh . Back on the market: Joey, 69, from London said: 'I got to a point where I thought I'm going to kick the bucket fairly soon', so three months ago, he joined Grindr, the mobile dating app for gay men and is now averaging four dates a week . Many felt overlooked and that they became invisible after the menopause. Margaret, 67, from Oxfordshire said: 'We still feel as though we have a right to be a sexual being as well as everything else. We're not just grannies. I'm not anyway! Younger people nowadays must think ""oh god, that's gross, you know, granny's at it.""' Connie, 83, from London, has just signed up for a dating site, even though she can't work a computer. Her granddaughter Nicola is acting as both facilitator and gatekeeper and sifting those she thinks are suitable. As Nicola sends a smiley to a man called John who's caught her Grandma's eye, Connie says that Nicola need not worry about her because she's 'got my wits about me, I do know what it's all about'. Helping hand: Connie, 83, from London has just signed up for a dating site, even though she can't work a computer. Her granddaughter Nicola, left, is acting as both facilitator and gatekeeper and sifting those she thinks are suitable . New research: Their research discovered that 51 per cent of people over 60 said they're sexually active and many describe enjoying a late sexual bloom, just like David . Stella and Peter met online and got married a year ago having both lost their long-term partners. Peter, who was 70 at the time, recounts the nerves of starting over again after many years without sex and said 'I can remember sitting on the sofa with Stella and discussing this and saying well I really don't know whether anything works anymore. So we decided to find out basically'. The internet has made finding love so much easier but this increased access to sex is leading to increased rates of sexually transmitted infections. In fact, STIs have doubled in the 50-90 age group in the past ten years. Discovery: For some women, it has only been in later years that they experienced an orgasm for the first time. Solange, 79, from Wales said: 'I might have been in my 40s when I had an inkling of what it was. By my 60s I'd finally figured out what it was. And in my 70s ""yes that's what it is"" Who knew? Many OAPs that Channel 4 spoke to said their sex lives just get better and better with age - and whether single, straight or gay, many are enjoying a second bloom . Justin Gaffney, a sexual health nurse consultant, said: 'There is a degree of naivety in the older population in that they just don't see that they are at risk of sexual infections'. In fact older people become more susceptible to STIs as they age - yet 64 per cent of respondents who are either in new relationships or are dating hadn't sought sexual health advice. Justin has had people come to him using household products as lubricants - shampoo, hand cream and even cooking oil. 'There does need to be perhaps a focus on trying to make services more older people-friendly,' he said. In many ways it is no surprise that older people are taking risks. Many respondents revealed that their first marriages in the 1950s and 60s had been repressed and if they are dating again today that they are keen to experiment and enjoy a much more empowered, adventurous relationship. For some women, it has only been in later years that they experienced an orgasm for the first time. Solange, 79, from Wales, said: 'I might have been in my 40s when I had an inkling of what it was. By my 60s I'd finally figured out what it was. And in my 70s ""yes that's what it is""'. Findings: Despite many feeling very liberated in themselves, many said they didn't feel like society was very approving of OAP sex . 51 per cent of people over 60 said they are sexually active . 46 per cent of respondents said sex is important to their lives . 33 per cent of respondents who are single said that they would like to meet someone new . 64 per cent of respondents that are in a new relationship or are dating, hadn’t sought sexual health advice .

"By . Sarah Griffiths . Adverts have appeared in people’s Facebook feeds since 2007, but you might notice that not all of them seem relevant to your interests - especially if you have not 'liked' many products. However, this is about to change as Facebook will show adverts relating to which websites you visit outside of the social network. While some people might find this useful, others may find it intrusive and a bit creepy. Facebook will show adverts relating to what you have already searched for online outside of the social network. Users who find this intrusive will be able to opt out and Facebook claims that a new 'Ad preferences' tool (pictured) will let people change their preferences easily . Adverts are currently generated by which brands' Facebook Pages you 'like' as well as other signals. Soon they will be chosen based on information from some of the websites and apps you use. Other sites already use this interest-based advertising. Facebook users will be able to opt-out of the new advertising system. A new feature called 'Ad preferences' will also allow people to manage their brand 'likes' to change the type of adverts they will see. Facebook claims that people want to see adverts that are relevant to their interests and, at the moment, the social network learns about your interests from the Pages you 'like,' demographic information and using Facebook Exchange. Facebook Exchange marks visitors to third party websites with a cookie so that people see adverts relating to the website they have already visited when they return to Facebook. But the company said: ‘Starting soon in the U.S. we will also include information from some of the websites and apps you use.’ Facebook continued that many companies already use this type of interest-based advertising, which is thought to be more effective. ‘Let’s say that you’re thinking about buying a new TV, and you start researching TVs on the web and in mobile apps. We may show you ads for deals on a TV to help you get the best price or other brands to consider. ‘And because we think you’re interested in electronics, we may show you ads for other electronics in the future, like speakers or a game console to go with your new TV,’ the company explained. Facebook claims that people want to see adverts that are relevant to their interests and, at the moment, the social network learns about your interests from the Pages you 'like' and how you interact on its website or app. The 'like' logo is displayed outside Facebook's headquarters in Menlo Park, California . While UK users may not be affected by the change for a while yet, as more users become affected, they can choose to opt out of the advert targeting. To do so, users have to look in their web browser to use the Digital Advertising Alliance opt out tool. Similar controls are also provided on iPhones and Android mobiles. Another new feature, called ‘Ad preferences’, will also give people more control over the adverts they see, Facebook said. The tool can be accessed from every advert shown on Facebook and it explains why that person is  seeing specific ads, as well as letting them remove interests used by the site to select relevant adverts. ‘So if you’re not interested in electronics, you can remove electronics from your ad interests,’ Facebook said. Ad preferences will roll out in the U.S. in the next few weeks and Facebook said it is working on expanding the new advertising system globally ‘in the coming months’.","Ads are currently displayed on Facebook according to Pages people 'like' as well as a number of other signals such as Facebook Exchange .

"By . Mark Prigg . Amazon has unveiled a music streaming service for its Prime members in a bid to take on Spotify and Apple's recently purchased Beats Music service. The Prime Music service is another addition to the giant's popular free-shipping plan, and is expected to feature heavily on its first smartphone, set to be unveiled next week. It will offer more than a million tracks for ad-free streaming and download to Kindle Fire tablets as well as to computers and the Amazon Music app for Apple and Android devices. The service will feature over a million tracks. However, Amazon failed to reach a deal with Universal, so artists such as Katy Perry (pictured), Taylor Swift and Jay-Z will not be available . Seattle-based Amazon reached licensing deals with most of the top independent labels and major recording companies Sony and Warner Music, but failed to reach a deal with top-ranked Universal Music Group. That means that while the service will feature artists like Justin Timberlake, Bruno Mars, Bruce Springsteen, Pink and Madonna — it will lack music by Universal stars such as Katy Perry, Taylor Swift and Jay-Z. People who pay $99 a year for Prime can listen to tens of thousands of albums from artists including Beyonce, The Lumineers and Macklemore & Ryan Lewis for no extra cost. By adding music, Amazon is hoping to hook new customers and retain existing ones on its Prime free-shipping plan, which also allows subscribers to watch streams of movies and TV shows and gives Kindle owners a library of books they can borrow once a month. Steve Boom, Amazon's vice president of digital music, said the service will pay for itself and isn't part of the reason why the company raised the price of Prime from $79 in March — a move Amazon said would cover higher shipping costs. Instead, the company will benefit because Prime members tend to buy more from Amazon and remain loyal customers. 'If they come to Amazon for their music needs, they become better and longer-term Amazon customers and we think that's a good thing,' Boom said. Seattle-based Amazon reached licensing deals with most of the top independent labels and major recording companies Sony and Warner Music, but failed to reach a deal with top-ranked Universal Music Group. That means that while the service will feature artists like Justin Timberlake, Bruno Mars, Bruce Springsteen, Pink and Madonna — it will lack music by Universal stars such as Katy Perry, Taylor Swift and Jay-Z. The service will be available on Kindle Fire tablets as well as to computers and the Amazon Music app for Apple and Android devices. The service also won't have many new releases — and for major artists that could mean music that has been released within the last six months. Universal didn't reach a deal with Amazon because it disagreed with the value of the lump sum royalty payment on offer for the albums in question, according to two people familiar with the matter. One person said the royalty amounted to about $40 million to $50 million for the entire music industry over two years. The Prime Music service also has hand picked playlists . Labels other than Universal concluded the amount would be equal to or better than a per-play streaming royalty, given how often the songs were played on other digital services, the person said. Both people were not authorized to speak publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. The deal comes on the heels of Apple Inc.'s announcement that it is purchasing headphone and music-streaming company Beats for $3 billion and is a further acknowledgement of the rise in popularity of streaming and the decline of digital downloads. Artists including Beyonce, The Lumineers and Macklemore & Ryan Lewis will be available on the service . U.S. sales of downloaded songs slipped 1 percent last year to $2.8 billion while streaming music revenue surged 39 percent to $1.4 billion, according to the Recording Industry Association of America. Early results this year showed a further decline in music download sales, Boom said. 'Music consumption habits are changing, which is why we started this,' he said. 'We saw the change happening.' Amazon will recommend songs to customers who have bought music from it in the past with offers to complete albums if they're available on the service. It has also hired experts to compile hundreds of playlists that are 20 to 50 songs in length based on genre or mood that are easy to download before getting on the subway or on a plane, Boom said. Russ Crupnick, managing partner of market research company MusicWatch, said that while the offering falls short of what's available on $10-a-month music subscription plans like Spotify or Rhapsody, it may be enough for Prime subscribers to discover they can enjoy an album or two for free. ""If you're a young person and really a superfan all about discovering new music, this probably isn't for you. That's ok, there's enough of the rest of us,"" he said.","Amazon reached licensing deals with most of the top independent labels, Sony and Warner Music .

"By . Sophie Jane Evans . Situated on one of the most exclusive streets in Britain, it already boasts four bedrooms, three reception rooms, a roof terrace and a courtyard garden. But now, this house has been put on the market for £12million - because it comes with permission to build a further two floors underneath it. The semi-detached Edwardian property is located on Mulberry Walk in Chelsea, London, the 16th most expensive street in the UK, where homes with the potential to expand are at a premium. Multi-million pound home: This Edwardian house has been put on the market for £12million - because it comes with permission to build a further two floors underneath it .

Prestigious: The homeowner has already gained planning consent to build two stories around 20ft beneath the enormous house. Above, the cream-coloured bedroom . Its owner has already gained planning consent to build two stories underground - with potential buyers offered the chance to excavate about 20ft beneath the house. Under the plans, approved by the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea Council, buyers could build a new studio, cinema gym, sauna, massage room and changing room on the lowest level. Meanwhile, a kitchen breakfast room, family room and en-suite bedroom could be created on the lower ground floor. The 100-year-old house is one of dozens of multi-million pound homes on the exclusive street, which has an average property price of £7.79million.

Although the building work would cost potential buyers a further £1million, it would nearly double the size of the property from 4,500 to a whopping 8,000 square feet. And despite the property's £12million asking price, estate agents insist it is ‘not an astronomical' cost. James Pace, of agents Knight Frank, said: 'At this level of the market a lot of people are quite willing to put their own mark on a property. 'The trouble is you can’t build out or up so people are tending to go down. Thanks to the planning consent it is a property with the potential to go from 4,500 square feet to 8,000 square feet.

'It has a lot of appeal for people looking for a considerably bigger house. It is a fabulous example of an Edwardian house. There are not many properties like it in London. 'Most properties in the Chelsea area are Victorian, four or five storey town houses that end to be half the width of this house. 'The planning potential that comes with this property does make a bit of a difference. It is a good price, not an astronomical price by any means. 'It would probably appeal to someone who lives here already and who spends most of their time here.' It comes as local authorities in upmarket areas of London are said to be clamping down on the number of applications by homeowners to expand their homes by going underground. Exclusive: It comes as local authorities in upmarket areas of London are said to be clamping down on the number of applications by homeowners to expand their homes by going underground. Above, Mulberry Walk in Chelsea, where the Edwardian house has gone on the market for £12million . Officials . are believed to be concerned about disruptions caused by building work, . including the constant noise, the affect on other residents and the . possible impact on water pressure. Earlier this year, actress Joan Collins spoke out about her disgust at . rich residents building basements in Belgravia, West London, where she has . lived since buying a flat there in the late 1980s. The . 80-year-old star - who was born in Paddington and looked at 60 . different properties before buying her apartment - said there was ‘too . much building work going on’ in her local area nowadays. She told Belgravia magazine: 'It's really sad. I find it shocking that people are digging down to . put in swimming pools and bowling alleys when they only live here for . two or three months of the year.' Speaking out: Actress Joan Collins (left), 80, and Queen guitarist Brian May (right), 66, have both spoken out against building works in the areas they live in . And two weeks ago, Queen guitarist Brian May accused his neighbours of turning upmarket Kensington, also in West London, into a 'hellhole' with their constant building works. The musician, 66, branded residents of the west London suburb 'selfish', and said they had 'declared war' on his family through constant construction work in his once 'nice quiet decent' neighbourhood. Writing on the 'Bri's Soapbox' section of his own website, May said he regularly lost sleep and could no longer enjoy sitting in his garden thanks to noise from the machines used by builders. Last year, an aristocrat joined dozens of people in protesting against 'mega-basements after her neighbour revealed plans to build a vast cinema and games room underneath . their £3.6m home in an exclusive street in north London. Pamela, . Countess Listowel, 77, said rows over people digging beneath their homes are dividing the usually friendly community in a . conservation area in Hampstead. She was one of 58 people to  object to Camden council over the application by Iyabode Abiola to undertake extensive excavations beneath her Victorian house.","Semi-detached Edwardian property is situated on Mulberry Walk in Chelsea, the 16th most expensive street in UK .

"By . Travelmail Reporter . Nearly a quarter of a million more tourists flocked to the UK in March compared to last year - thanks to the mild weather. As well as the number of overseas visitors soaring by 230,000, travellers also spent £40m more while they were visiting the country. Foreign residents made 2.41 million trips to the UK in March compared with 2.18 million in the same month last year - the coldest March in the UK for 50 years. Mild weather: 230,000 more tourists visited the UK - including London - this March compared to last year . During their 2014 trips, these overseas visitors spent £1.34bn - a rise on the £1.3bn of March 2013, the Office for National Statistics said. The latest figures took the number of visits by overseas residents to the UK for the first three months of this year to 6.99 million - a 10 per cent rise on the January-March 2013 total. Their spending for the first three months of this year is up 19 per cent to £4.26bn. This follows a record year in 2013 when overseas visitor spending passed the £20bn mark for the first time. Staycation: More Brits are choosing to holiday at home at places like Brighton rather than go abroad . In contrast, UK residents are making fewer visits abroad and spending less when they get there, despite a big rise in the number of Britons visiting the US where the pound is at a five-year high against the US dollar. UK residents made 3.44 million visits abroad in March 2014 compared with nearly 3.52 million in March 2013. Spending during those foreign trips slipped from £2.14bn in March 2013 to £1.88bn in March 2014. Spending by UK residents during foreign trips in the first three months of this year has totalled £5.55bn - down 8 per cent on the same period last year. Seemingly aware of the good pound-dollar rate at present, Britons made 24 per cent more trips to North America in the first three months of this year than in January-March 2013.","UK sees 230,000 more visits compared to last year thanks to mild weather .

They are the controversial contraptions that stand tall on the horizon – providing eco-friendly, renewable energy according to some, blotting the landscape according to others. But a new survey has planted a foot firmly in the former camp – suggesting that wind farms are now in danger of destroying the beauty of some of the most striking portions of the Scottish countryside. Divisive topic: Scotland has an increasing number of wind farms - including these turbines at Ardrossan . The poll, carried out by the Mountaineering Council of Scotland, has found that climbers and walkers are being deterred from visiting the country’s rural areas because of the increasing encroachment of turbines into what were once wide-open spaces. In results that will make worrying reading for the Scottish government, the survey found that over two thirds of people – 68 per cent – say that parts of Scotland are now less appealing to visitors thanks to the proliferation of wind farms. A similar number – 67 per cent – say that wind farms are making Scotland a less appealing place in general. Two thirds of those surveyed say they have been put off visiting Scotland by wind farms – and will not revisit places they have already visited where turbines now exist. Over fourth fifths of respondents are insisting that there must be protection for National Parks and National Scenic Areas. And two-thirds of those questioned want to see buffer zones around areas of specific beauty, so that wind farms cannot be placed on their edges. All change: Scotland has sought to expand its use of reneweable energy under Alex Salmond . ‘The survey results are a stark warning to the Scottish government,’ says David Gibson of the Mountaineering Council of Scotland. ‘Badly sited wind farms are a serious threat to Scotland’s reputation as a tourism destination.’ ‘The more that are built in our mountains, the more visitors are put off.’ Scotland has taken a marked step towards the wide use of wind power in the last decade. The Scottish government hopes to generate 100 per cent of Scotland’s energy from renewable sources by 2020 – with the majority of this power coming from wind farms. Whitelee Wind Farm, which opened in East Renfrewshire in 2009, is the largest on-shore wind farm in the UK, with 215 turbines (and the second largest in Europe, behind only the Fântânele-Cogealac development in Romania). Clyde Wind Farm, in South Lanarkshire, is another sizeable wind project, with 152 turbines. The rising use of wind power is of concern to Mr Gibson. Taking over? Whitelee Wind Farm in East Renfrewshire is the largest on-shore wind farm in the UK . ‘Many of the wind farms planned for . Scotland’s most remote and beautiful areas have yet to be built,’ he . continues. ‘The evidence from this, and other, surveys, suggests that . visitors dislike them more and more as they cease to be a novelty.’ The . survey consulted 970 regular climbers and hikers who are members of . either the Mountaineering Council of Scotland or the British . Mountaineering Council. Over three quarters of those surveyed – 77 per cent – live in Scotland. Wind power is a consistently divisive topic. A YouGov poll commissioned by the Sunday Times last October found a pretty even split on the question of whether the UK government is right – considering future energy needs – to invest money in the development of wind technology. Fifty-one per cent of those questioned said that the government was right in this case.","Two thirds of people say that parts of Scotland are now less appealing to visitors thanks to the proliferation of wind farms .

"By . Mark Palmer . The £16,000-a-night penthouse suite and the infinity pool just above it aren’t quite ready, but Room 4803 on the 48th floor is open for business. It’s perfect for anyone looking to go up in the world. But not recommended if you’re scared of heights. This is the highest hotel room in Western Europe and I’m the first to sleep in it. Called the Shangri-La it’s finally opened in The Shard next to the Thames in central London, almost a year behind schedule and still a work in progress. And it’s sensational in more ways than the Qatari owners might have wanted. Scroll down for videos . Mark Palmer is the first person to sleep in the Shangri-La hotel - which occupies 18 floors of the central London landmark, The Shard . One luxurious bedroom in the Shangri-La Hotel which has finally opened its doors almost a year behind schedule . An exterior shot of the Shard - from which numerous London landmarks can be seen including Tower Bridge, St Paul's and Battersea Power Station . Each of the hotel's stunning rooms comes with binoculars so guests can make the most of spectacular views. However, as Mark Palmer discovered, visitors can often see straight into neighbouring rooms because of a design fault . A pair of binoculars sits on the desk but the view hardly needs any amplification. Tower Bridge, to the east, looks like it belongs in a toy-town miniature village, while St Paul’s Cathedral just about holds its own to the west, with the river snaking through the capital, passing the Houses of Parliament, Battersea Power Station, Richmond Park and beyond. But what’s this just below me? It can’t be a naked buttock rising from a free-standing bath tub on the 47th floor? It certainly is. The corners of the building have a square chunk taken out so neighbouring windows face each other at right-angles. Look diagonally across and you can see straight in. You can also see the floor below, hence my close encounter with the buttock in question. I dare say people in the room next to mine across the gap, with their identical floor to ceiling windows, may have had the unsettling experience of seeing me wandering around in my birthday suit, too. Guests at the hotel may enjoy a soak in the bath while watching over the bustling city below. Mark Palmer even spotted one visitor enjoying a soak a few floors below during his stay . House keeping staff member Gintare Paul Auskaite makes the enormous bed of a superior Shard room . The modern and contemporary seating ares on the 34th level of the hotel - where rooms start at £450 a night . A member of staff places bottles of champagne in an ice bucket inside the restaurant and lounge area on level 35 of The Shard . There is a solution, but it defeats the whole purpose of spending anything from £500 a night for a berth in The Shard, which has 72 ‘habitable’ floors. Press a button and the electrically operated blinds come down — obliterating the much-vaunted ‘iconic’ views that you’ve spent a fortune to see. You might as well be in the local Premier Inn, albeit one with heated lavatory seats, marble flooring, Acqua di Parma soaps and a minibar selling mixed nuts for £7 a jar. All in all this dramatic design issue is highly embarrassing —unless you’re a Peeping Tom or in the British Naturism society, which is celebrating its 50th anniversary this year. And it’s hardly something that the Shangri-La can dismiss as teething troubles. ‘We are familiar with some flaws and will deal with those as we go along,’ says the hotel’s genial general manager, Darren Gearing. For now, he says, it’s a case of ‘orientating guests properly’ so they are aware of being spotted from below, above or to the side of their rooms. David Warrilow, a businessman from . Surrey, who has booked in for a five-star stay with his wife Gaynor to . celebrate her 60th birthday, thinks it is ‘plain daft’ and likens the . whole experience to the opening of Terminal Five at Heathrow Airport . when everything was built but not everything worked. He . has a point. My towel rail has a notice above it saying ‘very hot’ but . is stone cold; at breakfast my orange juice arrives after the coffee, . and the toast turns up as I am about to leave. The hotel directory urges . me to ‘enjoy a signature cocktail’ in Gong — the bar on the 52nd floor — . there’s no earthly chance of doing so because it is still under . construction. A waiter lays a table in the restaurant on the 35th floor of the the hotel which boasts stunning views across the city . The hotel's Lang patisserie and artisan deli which offers guests a selection of delicious food and drink during their stay . Demi chef de-parte Sebastian Williams produces hand-made sweet pastries for the hotel's Lang patisserie and artisan deli located at ground level . Kitchen staff preparing sandwiches for afternoon tea served in the hotel's restaurant . But if a deli experience is not up to standards, guests may enjoy a luxurious meal at the hotel's restaurant, pictured . But let’s not get too steamed up. This is a triumph in so many wondrous ways and it’s no surprise the reservations desk is busy. Graham and Nicola Hall, from St Albans, booked as soon as the hotline opened two months ago. They went for a special ‘Romance in the Clouds’ package, which includes a three-course dinner, bed and breakfast, a bottle of champagne and two massages. The cost? £850. ‘It’s been well worth it,’ says Graham, a 49-year old farmer and builder. ‘Life’s too short. Live for today. We’re going to come again when the pool is ready.’ The 11m x 4m pool is due to open in July. The Gong bar will be next to the pool on the same floor and is likely to become one of the most exclusive bars in the world. Eventually, there’ll be 202 rooms (59 are ready so far) and suites. Mine is on the Canary Wharf side, looking down on the Tower of London on the other side of the river. In my room is a leather-bound copy of James Hilton’s 1933 novel, Lost Horizon. It’s the story of a community in the mountains  of Tibet, best remembered as the origin of Shangri-La, a fictional utopia. Staff stand on scaffolding to clean just some of the thousands of metres of windows in the hotel . A outside view of the hotel - whch opened earlier this week. The penthouse suite - which costs £16,000-a-nigh - is still being worked on . The Room With A View package at the Shangri La hotel starts from £530 per night based on two adults sharing plus B&B . I dare say The Shard’s celebrated architect, Renzo Piano, read it before embarking on the £90 million project. It can’t have been his idea to put the baths by the windows in full view of other guests. Though it does add a certain frisson, an element of danger. ‘It’s a house of mirrors,’ says fellow guest Ray Anderson, 56, who lives in Cambridge. He’s here celebrating his birthday with his wife and is already planning to return in December. ‘I’ve stayed in tall buildings all over the world but this is the best of the lot — even better than the Grand Hyatt in Tokyo. It has surpassed my expectations. I love the silence in our room, then you open the blinds and all of life is out there but you still don’t hear a word.’ But he has a word of caution. ‘You just have to remember to turn the lights off at night to avoid being spied on.’ Room rates at the Shangri-La (0207 234 8088, shangri-la.com/london) start at £450 per night. The ‘Room With A View’ package is from £530 per night, based on two adults sharing, B&B and two tickets to The View from The Shard.","Shangri-La is located over 18 floors of landmark The Shard and boasts the highest hotel room in Western Europe .

"By . Lucy Crossley . A property developer has managed to found a tiny gap in the market on exclusive Sandbanks by building two tiny detached houses just 10 inches apart. At 16ft wide, the narrow homes have been squeezed onto a plot that measures just a tenth of an acre, and have replaced a single home that stood on the same site. Despite the homes being smaller in stature than many other homes in the sought-after community in Poole, Dorset, developers have managed to fit three bedrooms, three bathrooms, an open plan kitchen, living room and a basement for storage into each of the 840sq ft properties, which also have their own driveways. Scroll down for video . Gap in the market: A property developer has managed to find a tiny gap in the market on exclusive Sandbanks by building two tiny detached houses just 10 inches apart . Mind the gap: Due to the overhang of the cladding they appear to be just 10 inches apart from the front view, but from the back garden, they are separated by 2.6 feet, as demonstrated by journalist Frankie Carey . Although the distance between the two is just 25cm they are being marketed as two detached houses in the area, often dubbed Millionaire’s Row, or Britain's Palm Beach, where homes often go for around £4million. The properties, named Tom and Jerry, were designed and built by Seven Developments, owned by former AFC Bournemouth chairman Eddie Mitchell, and have gone up for sale with an asking price of £745,000 each. It is the first time such a narrow pair of properties have been built on a small plot on Sandbanks, but they could pave the way for similar developments in the future. Before: The two three-bedroom homes have been built on this single plot once occupied by a simple bungalow . Narrow: Although the distance between the two is just 25cm they are being marketed as two detached houses in the area, often dubbed Millionaire's Row, or Britain's Palm Beach, where homes often go for around £4million . Space saving: Each of the two properties, which cover 840sq ft, boast an open plan kitchen, storage basement and compact spiral staircases to maximise space . Located on a small peninsula . stretching across the mouth of Poole Harbour in Dorset, Sandbanks is . known for both its picturesque beach and the high value of property. By . area Sandbanks and surrounding Lilliput, Branksome Park and Canford . Cliffs, nicknamed 'Britain's Palm Beach', boasts the fourth highest land . value in the world and the UK's largest concentration of expensive . properties outside London. Sandbanks's popularity is attributed to . its seclusion, and every home in the community is within just a few . minutes' walk of the beach, with most of them enjoying stunning views . over the harbour or out to the English Channel. Houses were first built on Sandbanks in the late 19th century, but it . was not until the 1960s when a property boom saw the peninsula - . measuring less than half a square mile - become more and more built-up, . turning into a Millionaires' Row filled with luxury beachfront mansions. The property market on the peninsula has . shot through the roof in the past few years, with many houses being . demolished and replaced with cutting-edge new properties to meet demand. In . July 2009 a 1,393-square-metre (14,990 sq ft) empty plot of land on the . peninsula was put up for sale for £13.5 million – the equivalent of . nearly £10,000 per square metre. And earlier this month a bungalow bought for just £1,000 almost a . century ago (around £40,000 in today's money) and now a luxury holiday . home was reported to be now worth £5million - a 500,000 percent increase . in value. Last month a tatty 1950s three-bedroom Sandbanks bungalow which would be . worth just £200,000 in most other parts of the country went on sale for . an eye-watering £2.25million. In March, an empty plot on the exclusive enclave went on sale for . £3million - double what it had sold for before its old bungalow was . knocked down. Last year, 15 homes were sold for a combined total of £80million as Sandbanks' s reputation has continued to grow. Notable . residents include a number of well-known names in football such as . Crystal Palace manager Tony Pulis, former player and manager Graeme . Souness, Queen's Park Rangers manager Harry Redknapp and his son Jamie. Computer magnate Sir Peter Ogden also has a home there. Mr Mitchell said the houses were aimed at people looking to own a holiday home that wasn’t a flat. 'The size of the properties is an illusion, they are both the size of four bedroom family houses,' he said. 'We have built the properties up and front to back instead of from side to side and they are quite big and can comfortably take two children and a husband and wife. 'Not everybody wants to live in a large house and that’s why they choose to live in a flat or a town house. 'I think this is a new way to look at . developments, there are no restrictions when building up, especially . when there is a shortage of homes.' Roomy: Despite the homes being smaller in stature than many other homes in the sought-after community, developers have managed to fit three bedrooms, three bathrooms, an open plan kitchen, living room and a basement for storage into them . Comparison: Developer Eddie Mitchell said the properties were aimed at people looking to own a holiday home that wasn't a flat, and said their size was an 'illusion' as they are the size of four bedroom family houses . The properties have courtyard back gardens, their own balcony and underfloor heating throughout, as well as compact spiral staircases to maximise the living space. In 2013, a property in Sandbanks sold for the equivalent of £1,725  per square foot but the two new properties work out to a cheaper £620 per square foot. Gary Berendt, senior sales consultant at Arlington and Hall estate agents, said: 'These properties are very controversial. 'Even though one is close to the other . they are still detached houses and the people looking at them will . probably be doing so as an alternative to a flat. 'In comparison to flats, the houses have their own off road parking and private gardens. All mod cons: As well as this luxury bathroom, the properties boast private courtyard back gardens, their own balcony and underfloor heating throughout, plus a driveway providing off road parking . Striking a bargain? In 2013, a property in Sandbanks, home to football figures such as Tony Pulis and Harry Redknapp, sold for the equivalent of £1,725 per square foot but the two new properties work out as a cheaper £620 per square foot . Outside space: Both of the houses have a private patio garden at the rear, although those needing a little extra outdoor space will not have to walk far to find the nearest beach . 'I think they will appeal to people living in London or the home counties who are looking for a second home. 'For someone who is looking for a family home, this is probably a bit too small. 'These are the first properties to be built on small plots of land by Mr Mitchell, but I know that he has plans for several more across the area.' Over the last two decades Sandbanks, overlooking Poole Harbour, has become a millionaire’s playground with dozens of luxury beachfront mansions. The sandy peninsula is home to QPR manager Harry Redknapp and Crystal Palace manager Tony Pulis.and manager Graeme Souness, Queen's Park Rangers manager Harry Redknapp and his son Jamie.

There is one photograph that encapsulates the stand-off between the Chinese army and democracy campaigners in Beijing’s Tiananmen Square. It shows a man standing in front of three tanks. In his hand he is holding a carrier bag, rather as if he’s been rudely interrupted while out shopping. No one has ever identified the man, but that’s not the strangest thing about the photo — it’s the fact that in China today scarcely anyone has seen it. While Louisa Lim was researching this book on the legacy of the Tiananmen massacre, she showed the photo to students at four of China’s top universities. Out of 100 students, only 15 knew what it was. The rest hadn’t got a clue. A quarter of a century on, the events of June 4, 1989 have simply disappeared, expunged from people’s memories and history books. Tiananmen Square has been restored to a site of national pride. Yet it was here that the Chinese authorities turned the full force of their wrath on campaigners who had occupied the square for seven weeks. Legacy: Tens of thousands in participate in a candlelight vigil in Hong Kong to mark the 25th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre . Up to 250,000 troops were sent in, with orders to clear out everyone as swiftly as possible. In the ensuing battle, around 2,000 students were killed — there’s never been an accurate death toll. Afterwards, the troops built a huge bonfire of all the students’ possessions, the blood was hosed off the pavement and that, on the surface at least, was that. But Lim doesn’t have to do much digging to uncover the scars that remain. Several of the soldiers who took part in the massacre remain haunted by it. Ever since, one soldier, a man called Chen Guang who became an artist, has obsessively painted two pictures over and over again. The first shows a cheap plastic wristwatch — soldiers who took part in the massacre were given watches as souvenirs. The other is of a woman whose hair has been sheared off. When the square had been cleared, Guang saw a plait of hair tangled in the spokes of a bike — and he’s never been able to get the image out of his head. Erased: A Chinese woman poses in Tiananmen Square, the place where many seem to have forgotten a massacre occured . One of the dissidents, who spent seven years in prison, has not eaten food for ten years. He’s subsisted on milk as a protest at the way he and others were treated. The student leaders rounded up on June 4 were sent to penal colonies — one was so vast that a Japanese visitor who spent two days touring it by car still didn’t see the whole site. There, some were forced to eat strips of toilet paper soaked in urine — known as Noodles in Clear Broth. Others had their backs speared with sharpened bamboos, rubbed with salt and flayed — this was known as Twice Cooked Pork on an Iron Platter. The . student leaders rounded up on June 4 were sent to penal colonies. There, . some were forced to eat strips of toilet paper soaked in urine. Others had their backs speared with sharpened . bamboos, rubbed with salt and flayed . A few, though, were luckier. Perhaps the most remarkable story of all is how several dissidents were smuggled out of China with the help of the Hong Kong Triads. This bizarre alliance of pro-democracy activists and some of the most brutal criminals in the world was funded by the pop star Anita Mui — ‘The Madonna of Hong Kong’. But the biggest effect of Tiananmen Square hasn’t been the scars it’s left. It’s been the way it prompted a radical change in Chinese society. To deter further protests, the authorities came up with a brilliant plan: they would give students something even more alluring than freedom — money. Within a few years China had ditched communism and transformed into a money-crazed society. Several of the dissident leaders became multi-millionaires. One recently made a public statement of regret about his involvement in the pro-democracy movement: ‘I have a responsibility to my shareholders that is more important than politics.’ Paramilitary policemen march on Tiananmen Square after a flag-lowering ceremony . Students are now far too preoccupied with making money to worry about human rights. Successful entrepreneurs — the once despised  ‘running dogs of capitalism’ — are venerated as near-gods. When the biography of Steve Jobs was published there in 2011, the print run of 250,000 sold out on the first day. All this has left those participants who haven’t embraced capitalism baffled and saddened. A former Communist Party official who supported the protest, and who spent seven years in solitary confinement for his pains, says simply: ‘Everything that I have seen has left me disappointed.’ As well as being a scrupulously researched book, this is an unusually brave one. Lim, a former BBC correspondent in Beijing, lives in America but has relatives in China and is fearful about exposing them to danger. She’s done a terrific job of analysing how the world’s fourth largest country beat out the flames of revolt with bundles of cash.","25 years ago the Tiananmen Square massacre shocked the world .

"By . Rosie Taylor . Wind farms and flyovers which block some of the country’s most glorious views are one of the biggest threats to Britain’s cultural heritage, the chief executive of English Heritage has said. Simon Thurley said his ‘biggest challenge’ was to find ways to stop the erection of wind farms and other eyesores from obscuring historic buildings and monuments. He said: ‘My focus, and the focus of English Heritage, is to design ways we can judge the effect, of wind farms for instance, and other structures, that have an effect on the aesthetics of buildings.‘That is the biggest challenge we have today.’ Blight: Proposed wind farms will block some of the country¿s most glorious views, according to a heritage chief . Dr Thurley said the legislation that exists to protect monuments and historical buildings was ‘too old’. Changes were needed to laws so that the views of listed buildings were protected as well as the buildings themselves, he told the audience at the Cheltenham Literature Festival. ‘William Morris believed legislation should protect the physicality of buildings, but quite often it isn’t the physicality you are trying to protect,’ he said. Simon Thurley, Chief Executive of English Heritage, said his 'biggest challenge' was to find ways to stop  wind farms and other eyesores being built . Dr Thurley gave the example of Ely, in Cambridgeshire, where he said English Heritage was fighting plans to build a flyover that would block views of the historic cathedral ‘rising from the Fens’. ‘The heritage legislation we have today was not designed to protect the views of Ely Cathedral,’ he said. ‘It was designed to stop (people) bashing it down.’Dr Thurley said his other big challenge was getting 1970s concrete buildings listed. ‘We have to work out which ones are worth saving because there’s a lot of junk,’ he said. He added for years government ministers had refused to allow them to be listed and viewed them as ‘monstrosities’ - particularly Margaret Hodge, who when she was Culture Minister, ‘refused to list any concrete buildings at all’. But the current minister Ed Vaizey was far more obliging, he said, and had most recently agreed to the listing of the ‘concrete megastructure’ of Preston bus station. Dr Thurley also revealed that more than 400 buildings currently owned and run by English Heritage were going to be transferred to a charity. He said: ‘Like all (government) departments we have been absolutely hammered with cuts recently and it’s been very hard for us. ‘I think the best future for them (the sites) is in a charity.’ But he said the sites would go under the protection of a new charity and would not be handed to the National Trust because ‘we need competition’. ‘The two organisations (English Heritage and the National Trust) have a very, very different approach,’ he said, adding it was ‘healthier’ that way. Dr Thurley has been chief executive of English Heritage since 2002, and was dubbed the ‘boy wonder’ for being given the role at the age of 39. He added that existing legislation is not adequate to protect the beauty spots of Britain .","Preservation expert says vistas of Britain are in danger of being blighted .

Surprise attack: The young couple, both 21 were enjoying a romantic stroll towards a boat pier in Ao Nang, in southern Thailand, when a group of Thai youths on motorcycles pounced from the shadows . A young British tourist has told of the moment he was repeatedly stabbed by a gang of youths as he tried to save his girlfriend from a pack sex attack in Thailand. Jack Cole and April Clifton, both 21 from Bath, were enjoying a romantic stroll towards a boat pier in Ao Nang, in southern Thailand, when the motorcycle gang pounced from nearby shadows. The laughing thugs grabbed April, clawing at her clothes, before Jack jumped to her defence. But the armed youths then turned on him, puncturing his face and body with a flurry of stabs, before they fled into the night leaving Jack to die in a pool of blood. Luckily a passing British tourist heard Jack's cries for help and called paramedics to the idyllic beach resort. 'It was a calculated attack,' Jack said from the Bangkok-Phuket hospital today. 'They drove past us several times checking us out. We thought they had . gone but they came out of the shadows and attacked April.' 'They . laughed as they grabbed April as a mob. There were seven of them.  Four . men and three girls. I knocked the guy down who had grabbed April and . then they crowded around me and I thought they were punching me. 'But . it seems every punch was a stab. They were shouting in English ‘Come . on. Come on’. I saw that April had managed to run away to the safety of a . local Dive Shop and I fell to the ground as the group ran away . laughing. 'I managed to stagger up to a foreigner whom I begged for help and people came to staunch the flow of blood. Trauma: Jack said the youths were not interested in his wallet, just April. She is now too scared to go out alone while Jack recovers from his wounds in hospital . 'There . was no reason for the attack. We had never seen these people before.

"By . Anna Hodgekiss . A teacher has saved the life of a seriously ill pupil by giving her one of his kidneys. Ray Coe, 53, stepped in to rescue Alya Ahmed Ali, 13, after learning she was desperate for a donor. Ayla, from Stratford, east London, suffered from renal failure. She also has hydrocephalus - water on the brain - which has resulted in her having severe learning difficulties. Hero: Ray Coe, 53, stepped in to rescue pupil Alya Ahmed Ali, 13, after learning she was desperate for a donor . Her worried mother told Mr Coe during the summer term last year that Ayla  would be absent from school as she had to have kidney dialysis. Concerned, Mr Coe, a special educational needs co-ordinator, asked what he could do to help her. 'I said ""Can I put my name down as a donor?"" I knew what being a donor meant and I knew there was a possibility it could go ahead and I knew the implications. I knew exactly what I was doing. 'There is a verse in the bible that says something like: ""Maybe you were born for such a time as this"". It just clicked and I knew then that it was right. 'When we told Alya, she just gave me a big squeeze and her face lit up. It brings tears to my eyes whenever I think of that.' Gift: 'When we told Alya (with father Ahmed), she just gave me a big squeeze and her face lit up,' says Mr Coe. 'It brings tears to my eyes whenever I think of that' The pair went on to have blood tests and against all the odds, they showed that Ray was a match - despite not being related. The successful transplant went ahead at London’s Great Ormond Street Hospital in February. Both Alya and Mr Coe are now recovering well from the operation and are expected to return to school after the Easter break. Mr Coe said: 'For her parents, it’s not words that can express their gratitude. For them, I have saved their daughter’s life. Success: Both Alya and Mr Coe are now recovering well from the operation and are expected to return to school after the Easter break . 'It’s like I am another family member now.' Alya’s father, Ahmed Ali, 47, has hailed Mr Coe a 'hero and a lifesaver'. He said: 'Ray has given Alya much more than just the gift of life. He’s an amazing man, we owe him so much.' School headteacher Wendy Bower said: 'Mr Coe has gone above and beyond the call of duty with this selfless and noble act. 'He is a very humble and modest man. The whole staff are in admiration for his kindness. He has given a new life to Alya and her whole family.'","Alya Ahmed Ali, 13, from London, had suffered from renal failure .

"By . Kerry Mcqueeney . A teacher who rubbed garlic on his hands before wiping it on pupils he had chased has been banned from the profession for four years. Frank White, 61, threw a piece of wood across a . classroom, struck pupils with wood or his hands, shouted aggressively . and swore repeatedly, a professional conduct panel of the Teaching Agency was told. Mr White was also accused of making a racist comment and eating raw garlic to deliberately disgust his colleagues during staff meetings. Banned: Mr White was also accused of making a racist comment and eating raw garlic to deliberately disgust his colleagues during staff meetings at Witton Park High School (pictured) The panel said: 'He has behaved in a manner which is wholly inappropriate, intimidating pupils, criticising other members of staff, swearing and making a racist comment. 'When ignoring basic safety requirements is added, we are in no doubt that Mr White’s behaviour amounts to unacceptable professional conduct.' The hearing was told that Mr White was a design and technology teacher at Witton Park High School in Blackburn, Lancs between 2000 and 2010. Deputy head teacher Mrs Diane Atkinson told the panel the wood-throwing incident, which had caused fear, had been confirmed to her. 'Unacceptable behaviour': The school held disciplinary proceedings over a number of allegations which ended with his dismissal . She said Mr White had also told a pupil: 'I would probably rip off your head and s*** down your chuffing neck.' And she also claimed he had told girl pupils that, if they were his daughter, they would have 'a red bum'. He failed to make sure pupils wore aprons or safety glasses in his lessons and there had been a number of injuries, the hearing was told. Head of faculty, Christine O’Boyle, said that a large amount of garlic was found in Mr White’s cupboards. She said that he ate raw garlic before meeting senior staff - telling her this was to make himself repulsive so that meetings would be shortened. The teacher regularly used four-letter words in front of pupils, the hearing was told, and when the letter 'R' fell off the school sign, he was heard to say: 'Witton Pak. That’s more like it.' The school held disciplinary proceedings over a number of allegations made about his behaviour between 2008 and 2010. These ended with his dismissal in June 2010. Mr White was not present at the professional conduct hearing and was only represented for a short time at the start. Alan Meyrick, agency deputy director, said Mr White had shown signs of 'unacceptable behaviour across a number of areas and over a period of time'. He added: 'His behaviours fall significantly short of the standards expected of qualified teachers and they have the ability to undermine the public’s trust and confidence in the status and standing of the profession. 'Mr White dealt with both pupils and colleagues in an unacceptable way and his language and attitudes are wholly unacceptable.' He said that, as the panel had concerns about Mr White’s health, he recommended that he should be allowed to reapply to the profession in four years. He also has the right of appeal to the High Court.","Teacher threw a piece of wood across a classroom, shouted aggressively and swore repeatedly, conduct panel is told .

"By . Sarah Michael . Perth science teacher Geoffrey Vargas has been terminated after an experiment left two students badly injured with burns and lacerations . A science teacher has been fired after an experiment he conducted in class caused a glass jar to explode leaving two students badly injured with burns and lacerations. Perth Waldorf School administrator Bruce Uchiyama-Lee said teacher Geoffrey Vargas, 49, had been terminated following the March incident which injured two boys aged between 16 and 17. Mr Vargas said he made a 'mistake' in conducting the experiment but said the environment in the lab was 'very dangerous'. The experiment carried out during a Class 11 and 12 Chemistry lesson involved pupils lighting oxygen in a glass jar on fire. The glass has previously contained liquefied natural gas and this created a 'very powerful explosion' which severed the tendons in one student's hand. 'They've been treated and they're coping well but obviously [one student] needs some support in terms of school work because he can't use his hand,' Mr Uchiyama-Lee said. Mr Uchiyama-Lee said experts independent from the school in Bibra Lake, Perth concluded that the experiment should not have been conducted. 'The experiment wasn't curriculum based, it wasn't from a text book,' he said. 'It shouldn't have been conducted in any shape or form.' The students were practicing writing lab reports and there were a range of curriculum-based experiments that could have been carried out instead of the oxygen experiment, Mr Uchiyama-Lee said. 'Gases shouldn't be lit in glass jars full stop unless it's a beaker,' he said. The incident occurred at Perth Waldorf School (pictured) in March during a Class 11 and 12 Chemistry lesson . 'The whole experiment was wrong it shouldn't have been done full stop. 'It was believed the LNG had been burned out. That wasn't confirmed so when oxygen was added it combusted. 'If it had been confirmed LNG wasn't in there it wouldn't have been a problem.'[ . In a school newsletter issued to parents on May 1 Mr Uchiyama-Lee said the boys' recovery will be long term. 'Their recovery… will involve permanent scars and for one student it may involve further operations to ensure he has full movement of his hand,' he wrote. 'As these two boys are in Class 12 and going through the intensity of that year – Class 12 project deadlines as well as normal class work and exams are looming - being injured in this way has created much stress for them and their families.' Mr Vargas told MailOnline he made a mistake in conducting the experiment. The experiment involved pupils lighting oxygen in a glass jar on fire . 'I'm not denying I did a mistake by over-challenging the students, I should have just worked with limited equipment I had,' he said. 'The sequence of burning a gas and burning another gas should not have happened in that way.' But he said the lab was disorganised and 'something would have happened eventually anyways'. 'The whole environment in that school, in the lab was very dangerous,' he said. Mr Vargas said strong acids and bases were left in places where they were accessible by students. 'I made management aware of the fact that that needs to be locked away,' he said. 'That was just in cabinets in the classroom so any student could have opened it.' Mr Vargas also said the lab technician was overworked and did not organise experiments, there was no curriculum and no text books. Perth Waldorf School administrator Bruce Uchiyama-Lee said the experiment was not curriculum-based and should not have been conducted . 'I have to say about Waldorf school there is no set curriculum per se,' he said. 'The advice I was given, I had to follow a German chemist [Manfred] Von Mackensen, he is very popular with the Waldorf Schools.' Perth Waldorf School is a Rudolf Steiner School, which places emphasis on the whole development of the child — spiritual, physical, moral and academic. Mr Vargas said it was 'absolutely not fair' that the blame for the incident was placed solely on him. 'Of course I let down the team in a certain way but the team let me down at the same time,' he said. 'I've done a mistake in a team where there were a lot of mistakes being done, just one of many mistakes being done at that school, at the particular department and my one blew up.' Mr Vargas added that he had been in contact with the boy with severed tendons. 'There is no hard feelings whatsoever, not of the parents, not of that boy,' he said. Mr Vargas said he made a 'mistake' in conducting the experiment but said the environment in the lab was 'very dangerous' 'He is of the opinion that accidents happen. 'Of course I feel for the boys, I feel greatly for those boys, I'm really, really sorry they got injured.' Mr Uchiyama-Lee rejected Mr Vargas's claim the lab was unsafe. 'That had nothing to do with running an inappropriate experiment,' he said. 'The school hadn't been told by the teacher there were any issues from the lab.' Mr Uchiyama-Lee said  the school 'did not accept the claims being made by Mr Vargas', based on the extensive investigation conducted by the school into the incident. 'The investigation saw no link between the resources provided at the school and the experiment conducted by the teacher,' he said. 'The school sees these alleged claims as spurious. 'The school has sucessfully conducted a well run chemistry and science program for many years without incident and the resources, where requested, have always been provided in a timely manner. 'The school's primary concern has and always will be the safety and wellbeing of the students.'","Perth teacher Geoffrey Vargas, 49, terminated following lab accident .

"By . Matt Blake . Bizarre claims: Hal Adonis hugs Mikaela Mayer after her fight during the U.S. women's boxing Olympic trials in Febuary. Months later he said women boxers were either gay or molested as children . American amateur boxing has been flung into turmoil after the former chief of the sport said all female fighters had to be either child abuse victims or gay. In an interview with The New Yorker magazine over the summer, Hal Adonis, then president of Boxing USA, declared that being abused in early life provides the perfect . foundations for a successful boxing career. During the rant, he made a series of extraordinary claims about women's amateur boxing, including the words: 'Half of our girls have been molested, half of our girls are gay.' He also told the magazine: 'When kids call me up, I say: ""Let me ask you an honest question: have . your parents ever hit you?"" If they say no, I say: ""I don't think you . belong in boxing.""' The comments sent shockwaves around the American boxing community forcing the International Boxing Association (AIBA) to step in to demand his immediate dismissal. But while Boxing USA summarily sacked him as its president, a post he held since 2009, it refused the AIBA's request to remove him from its board of members. So in a decisive act of retribution on Wednesday, the AIBA suspended Boxing USA completely forcing the cancellation of all competitions and temporarily revoking the licences of amateur boxing gyms across the country. In a statement it branded his words 'defamatory to the reputation of AIBA, the sport of boxing, women's . boxing in particular, certain minority groups, and inappropriately . associating child abuse with the sport of boxing'. Fightback: USA's Claressa Shields, right, fights Kazakhstan's Marina Volnova, left, during their middleweight 75-kg semifinal boxing clash at the 2012 Summer Olympics in London . But today, the body made an unexpected U-turn and reinstated Boxing USA, stating: 'The athletes across the country were the biggest victims of this . suspension and we wanted to ensure that the mistakes of the . organization's past leadership have as little impact on them as . possible.' The two-year suspension from all amateur boxing activities AIBA placed on Adonis, however, remains in effect.

He told the magazine's reporter that being his father 'invented child abuse' and used to beat him around the face with his belt. 'When I got on to the streets and got into boxing, I was so used to getting hit it was like, ""hey, this is nothing!""' he said. When he trained young boxers, he said: 'Before a fight I'd start . smacking them real hard in the face. Because you feel, in boxing, the . first couple punches. After that, the endorphins kick in and it's like . someone gave you Novocain.'","Hal Adonis was sacked as Boxing USA's president when he said: 'Half of our girls have been molested, half of our girls are gay'

"By . Associated Press . U.S. public high schools have reached a milestone, an 80 percent graduation rate. Yet that still means 1 of every 5 students walks away without a diploma. Citing the progress, researchers are projecting a 90 percent national graduation rate by 2020. Their report, based on Education Department statistics from 2012, was presented Monday at the Building a GradNation Summit. Making progress:  U.S. public high schools have reached a milestone, an 80 percent graduation rate. Yet that still means 1 of every 5 students walks away without a diploma. Citing the progress, researchers are projecting a 90 percent national graduation rate by 2020 . The growth has been spurred by such factors as a greater awareness of the dropout problem and efforts by districts, states and the federal government to include graduation rates in accountability measures. Among the initiatives are closing 'dropout factory' schools. In addition, schools are taking aggressive action, such as hiring intervention specialists who work with students one on one, to keep teenagers in class, researchers said. Growth in rates among African-American and Hispanic students helped fuel the gains. Most of the growth has occurred since 2006 after decades of stagnation. ""At a moment when everything seems so broken and seems so unfixable ... this story tells you something completely different,"" said John Gomperts, president of America's Promise Alliance, which was founded by former Secretary of State Colin Powell and helped produce the report. Education Secretary Arne Duncan said . Monday the country owes a debt of gratitude to teachers, students and . families whose hard work helped the country reach the 80 percent mark. ""But . even as we celebrate this remarkable achievement, our students have . limitless potential and we owe it to all of our children to work . together so they all can achieve at higher levels,"" Duncan said in a . statement. Map of the U.S. showing high school graduation rates, by state, and chart showing graduation rates by race; newly released data shows U.S. high school graduation rate at an all-time high of 81 percent and could reach 90 percent by 2020. But blacks and Hispanics still lag behind whites . The rate of 80 percent is based on federal statistics primarily using a calculation by which the number of graduates in a given is year divided by the number of students who enrolled four years earlier. Adjustments are made for transfer students. In 2008, the Bush administration ordered all states to begin using this method. States previously used a wide variety of ways to calculate high school graduation rates. Iowa, Vermont, Wisconsin, Nebraska and Texas ranked at the top with rates at 88 percent or 89 percent. The bottom performers were Alaska, Georgia, New Mexico, Oregon and Nevada, which had rates at 70 percent or below. Idaho, Kentucky and Oklahoma were not included because these states received federal permission to take longer to roll out their system. The new calculation method allows researchers to individually follow students and chart progress based on their income level. By doing so, researchers found that some states are doing much better than others in getting low-income students — or those who receive free or reduced lunch meals — to graduation day. Tennessee, Texas, Arkansas and Kansas, for example, have more than half of all students counted as low income but overall graduation rates that are above average. In contrast, Minnesota, Wyoming and Alaska have a lower percentage of low-income students but a lower than average overall graduation rate. Graduation rates increased 15 percentage points for Hispanic students and 9 percentage points for African American students from 2006 to 2012, with the Hispanic students graduating at 76 percent and African-American students at 68 percent, the report said. To track historic trends, the graduation rates were calculated using a different method. Also, there were 32 percent fewer ""dropout factories"" — schools that graduate less than 60 percent of students — than a decade earlier, according to the report. In 2012, nearly one-quarter of African-American students attended a dropout factory, compared with 46 percent in 2002. About 15 percent of Hispanic students attended one of these schools, compared with 39 percent a decade earlier. There were an estimated 1,359 of these schools in 2012. Robert Balfanz, a researcher with the Everyone Graduates Center at the School of Education at Johns Hopkins University who was a report author, said some of these schools got better. Other districts closed these schools or converted them to smaller schools or parents and kids voted with their feet and transferred elsewhere. If the graduation rate stayed where it was in 2001, 1.7 million additional students would not have received a diploma during the period, Balfanz said. Progress: For the first time in U.S. history, the national high school graduation rate surpassed 80 percent in 2012 . 'It's actually a story of remarkable social improvement, that you could actually identify a problem, understand its importance, figure out what works and apply it and make a difference,' Balfanz said. In New Hampshire, where the graduation rate is 86 percent, Anne Grassie, a state representative and former longtime member of the Rochester School Board, cites a change in state law in 2007 that raised the dropout age to 18. In Rochester, she said there have been numerous initiatives such as programs that allow students who fail classes to begin making them up online or after school instead of waiting for summer school and an alternative school for at-risk students. 'We pay more attention to just making sure there's an adult to connect with every child, so they know someone's there for them,' Grassie said. 'I think those kinds of initiatives have a lot to do with kids staying in school, but it's a combination of things. It's not really one thing.' Among the advice offered by report authors to get the nation's graduation rate to 90 percent: .","For the first time in U.S. history, the national high school graduation rate surpassed 80 percent in 2012, according to a new report .
If the rate of improvement over the past few years is maintained, the country would see a 90 percent rate by 2020 .
Whites have an 85 percent graduation rate, compared to 76 percent for Hispanics and 68 percent for blacks .
Don't forget California. With 13 percent of the nation's schoolchildren and 20 percent of low-income children living in California, the state must continue to show growth. The state's overall rate was 79 percent compared with 73 percent for the state's low-income students.
Improve outcomes for special education students. Students with disabilities make up about 15 percent of students nationally but have a graduation rate 20 percentage points lower than the overall average. The rate for students with disabilities varies by state, with a rate or 24 percent in Nevada and 81 percent in Montana.
Focus on closing racial and income gaps.
Think big cities. Most big cities with high concentrations of low-income students still have graduation rates in the 60s or lower, the report said."
"By . Phil Vinter . Paedophile Leonard Davey has been jailed after the girl he abused 40 years ago saw him on a bus . A child abuse victim who was assaulted four decades ago has finally seen her attacker brought to justice after spotting him on a bus staring through the window at a youngster. The victim was only eight when government scientist Leonard Davey abused her in her home. She reported him to the police after she found herself on a bus with him and by chance saw him looking at a naked child who was playing on a balcony. She was so shocked by his reaction that she realised she had to report her own abuse to prevent him from harming any other children in the future. Defra researcher Davey, 64, of Exeter, was jailed for three and a half years at Exeter Crown Court today after being found guilty of nine indecent assaults on two different girls in cases which dated back to the 1960s and 70s. One victim who lived near to Davey was assaulted between the ages of eight and 21. The abuse over a 13 year period began with doctors and nurses games but progressed to more serious sexual activity. He abused the other girl during visits to her parents. He sneaked into her bedroom after telling her parents he was going upstairs to the bathroom. Judge Francis Gilbert, QC, told him: 'The jury, in my opinion rightly, found the victims to be compelling and truthful witnesses even though they were looking back many years. It is unfortunate you continue to maintain one or both are lying. 'You admitted some of the activity but said it happened at a time before you were 14 but the jury accepted her evidence about the timing. 'It is clear that you in effect destroyed her childhood and her teenaged years and the effect on her in later life has been entirely predictable and understandable.' The judge placed him on the sex offenders’ register for life and imposed a Sexual Offences Prevention order which forbids unsupervised contact with anyone under 16. After the case the second victim said: 'My aim was to make sure he could not get at any other children in the future. 'I was on a bus home and I saw him on it. Suddenly a young girl ran out on to a balcony naked as we were going. 'His reaction was so extreme it was scary. It was as if his eyes were popping out of his head. It brought everything back and at that moment I knew I had to go to the police. 'The chances against a child running out like that as the bus passed must be millions to one. It was an extraordinary coincidence. Perhaps it was divine intervention. 'It was a very, very hard thing to do because I had put the abuse behind me and it was difficult to relive it. It meant I carried it with me all the time whereas I had been able to bury it for a while. 'What he did has had a long lasting effect on my life. I don’t trust anyone and I don’t like being touched.' Davey, 64, of Exeter, was found . guilty at Exeter Crown Court, pictured, of nine indecent assaults on two different girls in cases which . dated back to the 1960s and 70s . The first victim said she believes the publicity surrounding the Jimmy Savile case made it easier for the jury to accept that victims can come forward so many years after they were abused. She said: 'I don’t think the sentence was long enough when you consider what he did to me over 13 years but the most important thing is that he was found guilty and we were believed. 'I did not report it at the time because I did not think anyone would believe me but it has had a dreadful effect on my life. It is why I am on my own now. 'This trial took place when the allegations against Jimmy Savile were coming out and I think it may have helped the jury to understand why some people keep these things secret for so long. 'It was different in those days. People did not come forward so easily. I hope that cases like these will help those who are being abused now to report it straight away. 'I did not do this for myself but for other people and to make sure that other people’s children would be safe.' Davey was employed as a respected research assistant for the Centre for Rural Policy at Exeter University for 18 years, where he worked for Defra and the European Commission. Davey admitted sexual contact with the first victim but said it happened when he was very young during 'doctor and nurse' games and while playing on the canal bank in Exeter. He denied any touching of the second victim.","Leonard Davey jailed for three and a half years at Exeter Crown Court today .

Jack Cole, 21, from Bath was stabbed in the face and body after the laughing youths grabbed his 21-year-old girlfriend April Clifton as they enjoyed a romantic stroll towards a boat pier in Ao Nang, in southern Thailand. After jumping to April's defence Jack was left to die in a pool of blood as the armed thugs fled. Recovering together: Jack Cole and April Clifton in Bangkok-Phuket Hospital after he was stabbed repeatedly when he tried to save April from a pack sex attack . She was also left bruised and battered when the motorcycle gang grabbed her, clawing at her clothes. Surprise attack: The young couple, both 21 were enjoying a romantic stroll towards a boat pier in Ao Nang, in southern Thailand, when a group of Thai youths on motorcycles pounced from the shadows . Luckily a passing British tourist heard Jack's cries for help and called paramedics to the idyllic beach resort. Jack said from the Bangkok-Phuket hospital yesterday: 'It was a calculated attack. 'They drove past us several times checking us out. We thought they had . gone but they came out of the shadows and attacked April. 'They . laughed as they grabbed April as a mob. 'There were seven of them.  Four . men and three girls. 'I knocked the guy down who had grabbed April and . then they crowded around me and I thought they were punching me. 'But . it seems every punch was a stab. They were shouting in English ‘Come . on. Come on’.

"By . Rachel Reilly . Enjoying the great outdoors has spawned an entire market catering for campers who want to enjoy a hearty meal without overloading their rucksack. Camping shops now sell a whole range of dried, lightweight foods - from all day breakfasts to chicken tikka masalas. But now a new - and some might say revolutionary - addition to their food shelf has been added: Dried beer. Scroll down for video . The beer sachets will launch in the Canada and U.S. in September but it is hoped that the portable drink will be available in Europe soon . A U.S. brewer has managed to create a concentrate that simply requires water being added and carbonated shortly before it is drunk. Pat's Backcountry Beverages has managed to create a near waterless formulation that claims to offer all the taste, aroma and alcohol of the traditional beverage. After water is added it must be carbonated with a simple gadget . Sam Hobbs, director of sales at the . company, told MailOnline that while the beer is not yet on sale, it will . soon be available to the public: 'We're hoping to launch it early to . mid-September and it should costs around $9.95 (£6.44) for a four pack.' The beer will be available in the U.S. and Canada but they have plans to expand their business. 'We definitely want to offer our . products to the UK and the rest of Europe eventually, but I can't say when . that will be at the moment.' The website explains that unlike other concentrate processes, their concentrate is not simply a case of brewing the beer and then removing the water afterwards. Instead, their patent-pending process enables brewers to start with almost no water, and carefully control the environment of the fermentation. Mr Hobbs' lips were tightly sealed when probed about the precise nature of the process however. The carbonation system costs $39.95 (£25.84)  and is light and easily portable. When the sachets are launched, each will make one pint of beer. There will also be two flavours -  one will be a pale ale and the other will be a black ale.","An Alaskan brewer has managed to brew a concentrated form of beer that, he claims, tastes and smells as good as a traditional pint .

"By . David Martosko In Washington . President Barack Obama said during a rare public session answering reporters' questions that he was unaware of any efforts to prevent survivors of the 2012 Benghazi, Libya terror attack from testifying before Congress about what they experienced. 'I'm not familiar with this notion that anybody's been blocked from testifying,' the president said Tuesday in response to a question from Fox News Channel correspondent Ed Henry. 'They’ve hired an attorney,' Henry told Obama, 'because they're saying that they've been blocked from coming forward.' 'What I'll do,' the president offered, 'is I will find out what exactly you're referring to.' Scroll down for video . Obama claimed ignorance of alleged efforts inside the U.S. State Department to clamp down on whistle-blowers who want to testify about the Benghazi terror attack and its aftermath . 'What I've been very clear about from the start is that our job with respect to Benghazi has been to find out exactly what happened, to make sure that U.S. embassies not just in the Middle East but around the world are safe and secure, and to bring those who carried it out to justice.' The White House has yet to take a formal position on the hundreds of Americans who lived through the Sept. 11, 2012 attack that claimed the lives of U.S. Ambassador to Libya Chris Stevens and two others. 'There are some survivors of that terror attack who say they want to come forward and testify - some in your State Department,' Henry said, 'and they say they've been blocked. Will you allow the Benghazi survivors to testify?' he asked. Mortar rounds, rocket-propelled grenades, gunfire and arson: The U.S. Consulate compound in Benghazi, Libya was destroyed Sept. 11, 2012, on the anniversary of the al Qaeda attack that killed thousands in New York City, at the Pentagon, and in Shanksville, Pennsylvania . Obama gave the question a brief answer, insisting that he didn't know about alleged efforts to keep the survivors quiet. 'I'm not familiar with it,' he reiterated, later adding, 'I'll look into that.' Fox News reported Monday that at least four CIA and State Department career officials have retained lawyers to help them with plans to provide sensitive information to Congress about the Benghazi attacks. It's unknown whether those potential whistle-blowers were part of the U.S. contingent on the ground in Benghazi. One of them reportedly has information about the federal government's inner-workings during the months before the Sept. 11, 2012 attack when the diplomatic mission in Libya unsuccessfully sought tighter security, during the attack itself, and during the crucial week afterward. It was in those first days that U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Susan Rice falsely claimed a spontaneous protest, inspired by a YouTube video critical of the Muslim prophet Muhammad, resulted in the consulate's destruction. Then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton testified before a congressional committee about Benghazi, asking 'What difference does it make?' whether the death and destruction was preplanned or spontaneous . Victoria Toensing, the man's attorney, told Fox News . that her client has been threatened by unnamed persons in the Obama . administration who have warned about the impact on his career if he . cooperates with Republican investigators in Congress. 'It's frightening, and they're doing some very despicable threats to people,' Toensing said. 'Not . ""we're going to kill you,"" or not ""we're going to prosecute you . tomorrow,"" but they're taking career people and making them well aware . that their careers will be over.' Utah Republican Rep. Jason Chaffetz told Fox News in March that he only had access to a 'handful of people' when he visited Libya shortly after the Benghazi attack, and that he has not been given access to other survivors in the months that followed. 'We want talk to the survivors. They won’t do that,' Chaffetz said of the Obama administration. 'And then the president has the gall to go on television and say ""Oh, we're providing all the access""? Baloney. Bull-crap. That is not happening.'","At least four career officials have hired lawyers as they prepare to share sensitive information with Congress .

"By . James Chapman . and Hugo Duncan . The economy will surpass its pre-recession peak within months as growth returns to its fastest pace since 2007, economists said yesterday. Analysts have forecasted growth of up to 3 per cent this year – as the latest GDP figures show national wealth rose by 1.9 per cent in 2013. Chancellor George Osborne yesterday welcomed the latest boost to the British economy but warned: ‘I am the first to say the job isn’t done.’ Chancellor George Osborne yesterday welcomed the latest boost to the British economy but warned that the 'job isn't done' The Office for National Statistics said the economy grew by 0.7 per cent in the final three months of last year, having expanded by 0.8 per cent in the previous quarter. Its report showed that 2013 was the first time since 2007 that output rose in every quarter of the year, with total growth of 1.9 per cent over 12 months. The powerhouse services sector, which makes up 77.8 per cent of the economy and ranges from hotels and restaurants to stockbrokers and accountants, grew by 0.8 per cent between October and December. Manufacturing performed best of all – rising by 0.9 per cent in the last quarter. Construction fell 0.3 per cent in the same period, despite the recent recovery in the housing market, but was up 4.5 per cent on the year. Overall, Britain is now the fastest growing major economy in Europe. But the economy is still 1.3 per cent below its pre-recession peak, having crashed by 7.2 per cent in 2008 and 2009 under Labour. However, experts say the economy will claw back the rest of the lost ground in the first half of this year – bringing the longest downturn for more than a century to an end. But Mr Osborne mocked Mr Balls' predictions of a million more jobless and no economic growth without rising borrowing and spending . David Tinsley, an analyst at BNP Paribas, said: ‘The economy can finally surpass the pre-crisis level of output in the second quarter of the year.’ And Rob Wood, a former Bank of England economist now at Berenberg Bank, predicted growth of 3 per cent this year and 3.3 per cent in 2015. He said: ‘Last year saw the strongest UK growth since 2007, and 2014 should see an even better result. The recovery will snowball.’ Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls yesterday welcomed the growth figures after ‘three damaging years of flatlining’ but said: ‘This is not yet the strong and balanced recovery we need.’ He added: ‘For working people facing a cost-of-living crisis this is still no recovery at all.’ But Mr Osborne mocked Mr Balls’ predictions of a million more jobless and no economic growth without rising borrowing and spending. ‘He has been wrong about all of those things. What they need on the other side of the House is new crystal Balls,’ he told MPs. ‘Ultimately you can’t improve the living standards of the country if you don’t improve the economy of a country, and that’s what is happening at the moment: the economy is growing and jobs are being created.’ The Chancellor also insisted that Labour would pose a serious risk to the recovery, adding: ‘The truth is that by being anti-business, they are anti-recovery, anti-jobs, anti-investment, anti the British people.’ The International Monetary Fund last week raised its UK growth forecast for 2014 to 2.4 per cent, while official figures show unemployment falling at its fastest pace since 1997. Joe Grice, chief economic adviser at the ONS, said four successive quarters of significant growth showed the economy was improving consistently. And John Longworth, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce, said: ‘These growth figures confirm what we’ve been hearing for some time. Businesses across Britain are growing ever more bullish about their prospects.’ But he added: ‘We mustn’t pat ourselves on the back for a recovery that is merely good, when what we need is a recovery that is truly great.’","Latest GDP figures show national wealth rose by 1.9 per cent in 2013 .

"By . David Martosko, U.s. Political Editor . President Barack Obama has become the 'Typhoid Mary' of congressional politics, a Republican political operative told MailOnline on Wednesday, with Democratic senators terrified to be seen with him as they fight to keep their jobs in November. Obama delivered a fiery State of the Union speech Tuesday night that was more about style than substance, drawing jeers for avoiding mention of the scandals that have plagued his administration since his last speech to a joint session of Congress. The president raised eyebrows and Republicans' hackles before the address by threatening to go around Congress to implement his agenda, but proceeded to present a laundry list of desires that require collaboration with Capitol Hill. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEOS . Paying attention? President Barack Obama spoke to Costco employees during a visit to a Lanham, Maryland on Wednesday, in a state where there are no U.S. Senate races this fall . Obama?s post-State of the Union travel itinerary has him avoiding states where his presence could hurt Democratic senators in tight re-election races . Part of Obama's State of the Union audience on Tuesday night was made up of Democratic politicians who fear being associated with him in public . Obama's visit to a Costco wasn't a random choice: The company's founder has raised millions for the president . Someone loves him: Obama may be facing strife among teetering Dem senators, but this Costco employee was showing him the love . The president launched a campaign-style . swing Wednesday morning to sell elements of his speech, but the five states he will visit do not include any where . Democratic senators are in tight re-election contests. Sen. Mark Udall of Colorado, a Democrat struggling to avoid being swept out . of office, dodged questions from CNN afterward about whether or not he . would welcome a presidential visit in his state. 'Is he a liability for you – the president – back home?' CNN's Dana Bash asked him in an interview after the president's State of the Union address. Udall bobbed and weaved. 'Does that mean you're going to campaign with him?' Bash demanded. 'That was not a yes or no,' Bash pressed after another lukewarm reply. Udall wouldn't answer. 'We'll see what the president's schedule is, we'll see what my schedule is' he said. 'But Coloradans are going to re-elect me based on my record, not the president's record.' A GOP campaign pollster in Udall's home state of Colorado told MailOnline that the senator has good reason to avoid the topic. 'The president is officially the Typhoid Mary of Senate politics,' the longtime Denver operative said, while asking not to be named. 'If he comes to Colorado to campaign with Udall, they're both going to get clobbered.' Tough stuff: Obama visits the US Steel Irvin Plant in West Miffin, Pennsylvania today, to follow up on his SOTU themes of job creation and retirement policies . Rolling out the policies: Obama set out a wish-list of reforms he aims to achieve in his landmark address but whether or not they can be realized will rely on Congress, not just executive action . Toxic: Obama, at the Costco bakery today, will visit Wisconsin on Thursday to speak at a General Electric plant in Waukesha. The Democratic mayor will not be there. Neither will Mary Burke, the Democrat running to unseat Gov. Scott Walker in November . America Rising, a GOP-aligned super PAC, produced a graphic on Wednesday showing the states Obama is visiting this week and next. The picture is one of the White House carefully avoiding places where America's increasing skepticism of his leadership might hurt Democratic senators. 'Democrats in competitive elections are going to have to freshen up their excuse Rolodex this fall if President Obama is headed their direction,' explained America Rising executive director Tim Miller, a former deputy communications director at the Republican National Committee. 'But pretending to be otherwise engaged is not going to save these Democrats from the leader of their party's sinking approval ratings in November.' Obama may be a political 'Typhoid Mary' as he goes into a five-state campaign swing following his State of the Union address . Obama's political radioactivity is also giving down-ticket candidates something to worry about. He will visit Wisconsin on Thursday to speak at a General Electric plant in Waukesha. The Democratic mayor will not be there. Neither will Mary Burke, the Democrat running to unseat Gov. Scott Walker in November. She 'has a full day scheduled in western Wisconsin Thursday and will not be able to join the president during his visit to Wisconsin,' her spokesman, Joe Zepecki, said Tuesday. Republicans in the state can hardly conceal their glee. 'It's no surprise that millionaire Mary Burke is hiding from President Obama,' Wisconsin state GOP executive director Joe Fadness retorted in a statement. He described President Obama as 'her party's unpopular leader and the architect of a disastrous health care law and policies that have resulted in record debt and a sluggish national economy.' Nationally, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid tried Tuesday night on CNN to stop the bleeding, insisting that Democratic incumbents will ultimately embrace Obama. 'Barack Obama is personally a very popular guy. And people love this man. They love his family,"" Reid said. The president 'is a good person to campaign for anybody,' he insisted. 'The president understands government. But he also understands politics. And that's why he won two elections overwhelmingly,' But Democratic senators Kay Hagan of North Carolina and Mary Landrieu of Louisiana made headlines recently when they failed to turn up at presidential events in their states. Tuesday's State of the Union seemed more tailored to building Obama's legacy than helping Democrats get elected, making it even less likely that Democratic senators will welcome him with open arms in the fall . Alaska Sen. Mark Begich, another . Democrat fighting for political survival, said last night that he would . welcome an Obama visit to America's northern frontier – but only so he . could show Obama how wrong his energy policies are, specifically . regarding drilling for oil and gas in the Alaska National Wildlife . Refuge. 'When I ran and won was the same year he ran for his first election for the presidency, he lost Alaska by 22 points and I still won my election,' Begich boasted. 'If he wants to come up, I’m not really interested in campaigning. What I’d like him to do is see why his policies are wrong on ANWR, for example,' he said. 'He opposes oil and gas development. I’d like to show him why it’s the right move to move that forward, to create jobs in oil and gas.' Senate Democrats need to hold on to their majority in order to prevent Republicans from controlling the entire Congress during President Obama's last two years in office. They are defending 21 seats in November, compared with just 15 for Republicans. Five of those are in red states – Alaska, Arkansas, Montana, South Dakota, and West Virginia – where Gallup notes Obama averaged just 35-percent support last year. That reality has created scenarios where vulnerable Democrats are shunning a politically toxic Obama, whose potent scandals have tainted his Departments of State, Justice, Treasury and Health and Human Services. Since 2004 just 4 out of 49 incumbent senators have won re-election when their party's sitting president was less popular in their home states than he was nationally, notes National Journal. 'Senate Democrats have a big problem,' the inside-the-beltway newspaper concludes. 'President Obama is very, very unpopular in the states Democrats have to defend in the 2014 elections.'","Obama is polling at just 35 per cent approval in five key 'red' states where Democratic senators must defend their seats in November .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Japanese scientists have found a way to decipher dreams for the very first time. Their report shows that patterns of activity in certain visual parts of the brain are the same whether we are awake or dreaming. Researchers from ATR Computational . Neuroscience Laboratories in Kyoto, Japan, scanned three male . volunteers' brains in an exhausting test over several days to examine . how activity could be related to their dreams. Japanese scientists have found a way to tell what people dream about by carrying out research on three men . Researchers scanned the volunteers' brains as they slept to monitor activity over several days . The volunteers were woken up every time they began to nod off and dream. Each time, the men were asked what they had dreamed about before they fell back to sleep. The process was repeated until an enormous 200 reports had been collated from each man. The results showed that most of the dreams were about mundane, everyday life. The research found that the most commonly occurring themes in the dreams included cars . The volunteers were also asked to view images of items that they often dreamed about, such as computers, as  their brains were scanned for a second time . The volunteers were then asked to view images of the most commonly-occurring themes, such as 'car', 'man', 'woman' and 'computer', as their brains were scanned again. It enabled the scientists to identify patterns in three parts of the brain, which processes what the eye sees. They also found that activity in a number of other areas of the brain, which have a particular focus on visual processing, varied according to the dreams. Yukiyasu Kamitani of the ATR Computational Neuroscience Laboratories in Kyoto, Japan, told Nature News: 'By analysing the brain activity during the nine seconds before we woke the subjects, we could predict whether a man is in the dream or not, for instance, with an accuracy of 75 to 80 per cent.'","Japanese researchers analysed the dreams of three men over several days .

"By . David Williams . In the towering shadow of Pakistan’s Black Mountain, Irfan Naseer and Irfan Khalid were trained to assemble the deadly IEDs that are the scourge of British soldiers. The home-grown terrorists learned the tradecraft of mass murder that they wanted to bring to the shopping centres, cinemas and train stations of Britain. The pair had originally flown to Karachi but made their way to the training camp after meeting other fundamentalists in the madrasas of the city. Inside one of the anonymous white washed houses and compounds that dot the hillside, they were taught to mix chemicals and ingredients from ordinary household items. Plot: Irfan Khalid and Irfan Naseer arrive at Birmingham airport before heading to Pakistan for terrorist training . Training camps: Khalid and Naseer (pictured with the trolley) were caught on CCTV going back and forth to Pakistan from Birmingham Airport to receive instruction on plotting their attack on Britain . From nail polish remover, bleach and fertiliser, they made crude bombs. Then, in the vast open spaces of the . tribal lands 140 miles north of Pakistan’s capital Islamabad, they were . shown by Al Qaeda-linked bomb-makers how to detonate the devices, fire . Kalishnikovs and use poisons, as well as being made to undergo . exhaustive physical exercise. Once back in the UK they tried to . create a new kind of improvised explosive device from the ingredients of . cold packs used to ease swelling on bruised or injured joints. But they didn’t release that the ingredients had been changed because of fears they may be misused. Collecting for terror: Irfan Naseer left and Irfan Khalid holding bucket undertake bogus charity collections in Birmingham to secretly raise funds for their bombing campaign . Watched: The group were under surveillance 24 hours a day by MI5 and the police, pictured here returning from a trip to a camp in Pakistan . Charity funded terror: The men posed as . fundraisers for a Muslim charity (left) then used the cash to pay for . bomb devices such as this alarm clock (right) Instead of ammonium nitrate, which . can be transformed into a potent explosive, the packs were filled with . relatively harmless urea, a key constituent of urine. The gang had hoped to carry the . devices in rucksacks or hide them in bags and detonate them using . suicide bombers or remote timers. When police raided the bomb factory, . they discovered a sample sports pack had been carefully taken apart and . the contents laid on a tray. In a bin was a partially burned . handwritten note which, when analysed, contained identical formulas for . bombs used against British troops in Afghanistan. Discussing the plot, Naseer said: . ‘Seven or eight of them in different places with timers on... all for . the same time probably to go boom, boom, boom everywhere.’ He estimated that a 1kg device, . easily carried in a bag, would kill 25 and injure up to 70 people, . especially if wrapped with metal bolts to create deadly shrapnel. But it was in Pakistan – some 3,800 . miles from their Birmingham homes and their intended targets – that the . Britons were turned into trained killers. The rugged Black Mountain or the Kala . Dhaka region of Pakistan’s North West Frontier province was one of . three principal areas they visited to meet fellow radicals and receive . training during two lengthy visits to the country. On the first of their extended visits . in March 2009, Naseer and Khalid received at least eight days intensive . training and additional radicalisation and religious instruction. That . rose to 40 on the second visit between December 2010 and July 2011. In Karachi, the Britons studied at . madrasas attached to two mosques with other radicalised young men, . including several foreigners. Both mosques, which are said to receive . large donations and funding from wealthy supporters in the UK, have . links to Jaish e Mohammad or Army of Mohammad, a jihadi group branded a . terrorist organisation by the UK and US. It was formed to wage a proxy . war against India over the disputed territory of Kashmir. The group have successfully . cultivated important relationships with other prominent jihadi . organisations including Al Qaeda, the Taliban and Lashkar-e-Taiba, which . was said to have trained the terrorists who carried out the 2008 attack . on Mumbai hotels. Probe: Police raided properties all over Birmingham, including this safe house, which was full of bomb-making equipment and documents detailing how to make them . Safe house: The trio were based at this property in White Street, Birmingham, and used as the headquarters for their terror cell . Explosive: Police uncovered a variety of powders and liquids, including this 'cold pack' in the dingy house . Destroying the evidence: Police found this burnt note that detailed the bomb-making process . Bomb-making equipment: Police discovered a . variety of ordinary domestic equipment including granules to keep . material cold (left) and a pharmaceutical syringe (right) Officials in Pakistan say their bomb . makers were among those believed to have tutored Naseer and Khalid in . making explosives  while they studied the Koran with their clerics. Tens of thousands of young British men visit Pakistan each year genuinely to study or stay with relatives. Naseer and Khalid told police they . visited family in the Punjab, close to the Kashmir area, where . investigators believe they met trainers – underlining the huge problems . facing anti-terror investigators in the UK. Fundraising: Irfan Naseer,  Irfan Khalid and Ashik Ali held table top sales in Birmingham where the cash raised would be secretly siphoned off to pay for trips to Pakistan . Surveillance: MI5 had been watching the terror group and had planted a bug in their Hinda Civic where they were heard boasting about the atrocity they planned . Shopping: Ashik Ali was watched buying curtains from Argos as part the sophisticated spying operation by the British secret services . But by the time of their second visit . Naseer and Khalid were ‘on the radar’ of MI5 and Pakistan’s Inter . Services Intelligence agency. They went to the Waziristan area . skirting Pakistan’s border with Afghanistan, where Taliban and Al Qaeda . trainers are active. They also went to the hills above the Tattapani . region of disputed Kashmir, for years a hub of Jaish e Mohammad’s . activities. It was while in Waziristan that the . Britons faced what investigators called ‘a wake-up call to the reality . of the region’ which has become the focus of controversial drone attacks . by the US. For four hours Nasser and Khalid cowered beneath the camouflage of trees while a drone had circled overhead. Late night: Officers pulled the terrorists over as they drove to a takeaway just before midnight . Prosecution: Ashik Ali was taken from the car and is detained along with the two other men who were all found guilty of terrorism offences at Woolwich Crown Court today . Capture: West Midlands Police arrested the three men in Birmingham after intercepting them in their VW as they drove through the city in September 2011 . Naseer was secretly recorded by MI5 . recalling: ‘If I have to stay here for another hour, I will pray that I . get hit by a drone.’ Partially because of the success of . the drones, fixed training camps no longer exist in areas like . Warizistan or Kala Dhaka. Instead, they are set-up in rural and isolated . spots to be used only once. Religious instruction and physical . training are always included and like other convicted British jihadists, . the two Britons underwent exhausting fitness training – running . repeatedly up hills. The month after their return four . fellow would-be British suicide bombers from the cell they hoped to . create travelled to Pakistan for terrorist training. They were Naweed Ali, 24, Ishaaq Hussain, 20, Khobaib Hussain, 20, and Shahid Khan, 20. Three of the young men came back to . Britain within days after the family of one of them discovered where . they had gone and arranged for their return. The fourth apparently . stayed on in Pakistan with family until October.

"By . Kirk Maltais . Appalling new video has been released in Denver, Colorado, showing police officers throwing an inmate into his cell, where he was then choked and tased by a swarm of officers. The video, unsealed on Friday by a judge in U.S. District Court as part of an order releasing other documents in an internal investigation into the conduct of the Denver Sheriff Department, shows an officer throwing inmate Jamal Hunter into a cell, where he then held down and choked with another officer joining in. A third officer then enters the cell in the July 31, 2011 incident, and begins shocking Hunter with a Taser. Two more officers then enter to help restrain the inmate. WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT (scroll down for video) Deputy Edward Keller (pictured top left) choking inmate Jamal Hunter (pictured bottom left) The video was unsealed in an order by U.S. District Judge John Kane on Friday . The video was released as part of a larger case involving Hunter, who is suing the City of Denver and individual officers with claims of rampant corruption inside of the Denver County Jail. The video shows Deputy Edward Keller throwing Hunter into the cell, then immediately throwing him onto his bed and choking him. The officer that shocked Hunter with the Taser has been identified as Sgt. Anthony Mazzei, who used the Taser twice on Hunter. According to The Denver Post, the incident began when Hunter spat and cursed at Keller, calling him a racist. In an incident two weeks before the videotaped assault of Hunter, he was attacked by other inmates, allegedly under the supervision of the deputy assigned to monitor the pod that Hunter lived in. According to court documents, Hunter was held down and beaten by one inmate, while another stood as a lookout. A third inmate then entered and poured a cup of scalding hot water onto Hunter, which severely burned him. 'I was attacked by inmates and it led to me being scalded very bad on my . pelvis, my genitals, and it was just a terrible burn,' Hunter told . CBS4. Jamal Hunter with a head wound after his assault on July 18, 2011, where he was beaten and scalding hot water was thrown onto his body . Hunter's burn on his pelvis and genitals, which he received as retaliation from other inmates who believed him to be a 'snitch' The burns on Hunter's pelvis. Since the attack, law enforcement has been accused of failing to properly investigate the incident and intimidating witnesses . The attack were spurred by inmates believing that Hunter was an informant. According to Hunter's lawsuit, an inmate was told this by Gaynel Rumer, the deputy in charge of the pod where Hunter lived. In an affidavit from Amos Page, one of the inmates that participated in the July 18 attack on Hunter, Rumer told the inmate this information to 'poor [sic] gas on a fire.' Page claimed that Hunter would make fun of Rumer for drinking alcohol during his shift. According to the affidavit, Rumer was in business with other inmates in the pod, allowing pornography, drugs and alcohol to be sold in exchange for a cut of the proceeds. Rumer would also assist the inmates in their administering beatings to other inmates who were 'snitches' or sex offenders. 'Rumer would let me control the pod. Rumer would allow me to give other inmates violations such as ""50 punches to the chin"" or ""straight up two minutes"" (two minutes with four homies)' said Page in the document. He also claimed to tell Hunter that 'this is not the spot for you' prior to the July 18 attack. Jamal Hunter, who believes that the Denver Sheriff Department and the police department are 'conspiring' together to cover up his claims of corruption in Denver County Jail . Footage of the July 31 incident was released as part of the order by U.S. District Judge John Kane, who has asked federal prosecutors to investigate the 'patterns and practices' of the sheriff's and police departments. Since the attacks on Hunter, other officers with both the police and sheriff's departments have been accused of intimidating witnesses involved in the matter. 'The police department and sheriff’s department I believe are conspiring,' Hunter told CBS4. Since the attacks, the Denver District's Attorney's Office has twice declined to prosecute the matter, a fact outraging Judge Kane. 'I think it…smacks of a sham to suggest that the Internal Affairs Bureau . of the Denver Police Department was investigating any kind of a case for . criminal activity on the part of the affiants, on the part of Mr. Page, . or on the part of the plaintiff [Hunter] in this case,' said Kane. In the July 31 incident, Deputy Keller was suspended for 30 days for using excessive force.

"By . Mark Prigg . A major online security alert has been issued after experts found a bug in one of the web's most common security systems. Called the 'heartbleed' bug, it allows hackers to eavesdrop on supposedly secure communications. The vulnerability was found by Google researchers in the OpenSSL cryptographic library, which is believed to be used in some way by roughly two-thirds of all websites on the Internet and is part of the most common server software in use. Experts say the bug could leave up to 66% of sites vulnerable to hackers if their encryption software is not updated. It compromises secret keys used to identify the service providers and to encrypt web traffic. This includes the names and passwords of the users and actual content, such as credit card numbers . OpenSSL is open-source software that is widely used to encrypt web communications. It is used to protect websites, instant messaging, email servers, virtual private networks and other communications. It is used in two of the most widely used Web servers, Apache and nginx. It is claimed heartbleed can reveal the contents of a server's memory, where the most sensitive of data is stored, including private data such as usernames, passwords, and credit card numbers. The flaw also allows an attacker can get copies of a server's digital keys, which can be used to impersonate servers or to decrypt communications from the past or potentially the future, too. The flaw was introduced in OpenSSL in December 2011, and was been 'in the wild' until yesterday, when a new version fixing the flaw was released. Experts have confirmed the flaw is real. 'We were able to scrape a Yahoo username & password via the Heartbleed bug,' tweeted Ronald Prins of security firm Fox-IT, showing a censored example. Developer Scott Galloway, 'Ok, ran my heartbleed script for 5 minutes, now have a list of 200 usernames and passwords for yahoo mail...TRIVIAL!' The problem was uncovered by a team of researchers from Google Security and Codenomicon. Research by analytics firm Netcraft says almost 500,000 websites could be affected. 'The serious overrun vulnerability in the OpenSSL cryptographic library affects around 17% of SSL web servers,' it says. Its research found Twitter, GitHub, Yahoo, Tumblr, Steam, Flickr, HypoVereinsbank, PostFinance, Regents Bank, Commonwealth Bank of Australia, and the anonymous search engine DuckDuckGo are all affected. The bug means hackers can eavesdrop and leave no trace in server logs. The flaw was introduced in OpenSSL in December 2011, and was 'in the wild' until Monday, when a new version fixing the flaw was released . Researchers have even given the bug its own logo . 'The heartbleed bug allows anyone on the internet to read the memory of the systems protected by the vulnerable versions of the OpenSSL software,' according to a website the researchers who found the flaw set up to explain their find. 'This compromises the secret keys used to identify the service providers and to encrypt the traffic, the names and passwords of the users and the actual content. 'This allows attackers to eavesdrop communications, steal data directly from the services and users and to impersonate services and users.' The vulnerability has been dubbed the Heartbleed Bug because it was discovered 'in the OpenSSL's implementation of the TLS/DTLS (transport layer security protocols) heartbeat extension (RFC6520),' the team said. 'This bug has left large amount of private keys and other secrets exposed to the Internet,"" they warned. 'Considering the long exposure, ease of exploitation and attacks leaving no trace this exposure should be taken seriously.' The Heartbleed bug allows anyone on the Internet to read the memory of the systems protected by the vulnerable versions of the OpenSSL software. This compromises the secret keys used to identify the service providers and to encrypt the traffic, the names and passwords of the users and the actual content. This allows attackers to eavesdrop on communications, steal data directly from the services and users and to impersonate services and users. Daniel Foster of hosting firm 34SP.com warned firms with eCommerce capabilities to be extra cautious. 'With potentially all web users affected by the recent ‘heartbleed’ security bug that has hit OpenSSL software, which is the software that protects credit card transactions - it is important that eCommerce businesses contact their web hosting providers to check that they have taken necessary actions to avoid their customers being affected by spying and eavesdropping,' he said.","Experts urged server owners to upgrade to latest version of OpenSSL software .

"By . Ted Thornhill . Ruling: Brunei's Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah has decreed that a new Islamic criminal law that could include penalties like amputation for theft and stoning for adultery will be enforced in six months . Brunei's sultan announced on Tuesday that a new Islamic criminal law that could include penalties like amputation for theft and stoning for adultery will be enforced in six months. Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah said the Shariah Penal Code, which would be applied to Muslims only, should be regarded as a form of ‘special guidance’ from God and would be ‘part of the great history’ of the tiny, oil-rich monarchy on Borneo island. ‘By the grace of Allah, with the coming into effect of this legislation, our duty to Allah is therefore being fulfilled,’ the sultan said at a legal conference in Brunei's capital. Brunei's Shariah Islamic court had previously handled mainly family-related disputes. The sultan has been hoping to implement the new law for years to bolster the influence of Islam in Brunei, where Muslims comprise about two-thirds of the population of nearly 420,000 people. The minorities are mainly Buddhist, Christians and people of local indigenous beliefs. Brunei's Mufti Awang Abdul Aziz, the country's top Islamic scholar, told Tuesday's conference that the Shariah law ‘guarantees justice for everyone and safeguards their well-being.’ ‘Let us not just look at the hand-cutting or the stoning or the caning per se, but let us also look at the conditions governing them,’ Awang said. ‘It is not indiscriminate cutting or stoning or caning. There are conditions and there are methods that are just and fair.’ Under secular laws, Brunei already prescribes caning as a penalty for crimes including immigration offenses, for which convicts can be flogged with a rattan cane. On the world stage: The Prince of Wales walks with The Sultan of Brunei before Charles received The Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah International Prize for the promotion of dialogue between Islamic and Western civilizations, at a ceremony in London in 2004 . Awang said there should be no concerns that foreign travelers might end up avoiding Brunei after the law is implemented. ‘Please listen to our answer. Sir, do all potential tourists to Brunei plan to steal? If they do not, then what do they need to fear,’ he said. ‘Believe me when I say that with our Shariah criminal law, everyone, including tourists, will receive proper protection.’ The implementation of Shariah criminal law is not expected to face vocal opposition in Brunei, which has long been known for conservative policies such as banning the public sale of liquor. Sultan Hassanal, who has reigned since 1967, is Brunei's head of state with full executive authority. Public criticism of his policies is extremely rare in Brunei. He reportedly owns around 6,000 cars. His palace is said to have 1,788 rooms and he has also built mosques with touches of gold and diamonds. He also owns a $400 million Boeing 747 that's fitted with wash basins of solid gold and Lalique crystal.","Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah said the law would be applied to Muslims only .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A Bronx man who became an unwitting viral sensation for being strip-searched under citizens arrest 'after stealing a Snickers bar' is now suing the 7-Eleven store where it all started, claiming 'emotional distress'. The 'candy thief', David Golson, 30, is said to have undergone trauma from the incident and the way in which it has since spread around the world. The video, dated October 17, 2012, was taken by a fellow shopper in the Brooklyn 7-Eleven about 11.20pm. Three of the clerks of the store - which is on Flatbush Avenue Extension - detain Golson and start ripping his clothes off during the ensuing struggle. Scroll down for video ... The Snickers struggle: David Golson is wrestled to the ground by three 711 clerks, who are attempting to strip search him on the suspicion of shoplifting . Having gone all around the world, the incident will again be aired, this time in Bronx Supreme Court, with David Golson (pictured) suing for emotional distress for the way he was treated . He was suspected of shoplifting and attempted to make a run for it. The employees then drag him back inside the store. While shoppers initially laugh at the scuffle, the scene quickly changes, and the employees are accused of 'attacking' Golson. By the end of the three-minute clip, Golson is practically nude and humiliated. 'This is ridiculous! For some Snickers!' one shopper yells in the video. Golson was detained until police arrived. He was subsequently charged with robbery, assault, criminal mischief and criminal possession of stolen property. Some parts of the Youtube video, like this one, get quite rough, as David Golson tries to break free from three 711 employees, screaming: 'I didn't take nothing.' A 7-Eleven spokeswoman said at the time that one of the employees was fired for restraining the suspect. It is said to be the one holding onto Golson for the majority of the video. It was claimed the employee had bitten Golson's back during the struggle. The other two workers were forced to retake a class regarding safety and security at the convenience store. Practically naked: David Golson is now suing for 'emotional distress'. He was charged with a litany of felonies following the incident, even though it centered around one Snickers bar . Now, in documents filed in Bronx Supreme Court, the 30-year-old is suing for 'emotional distress' for both the way he was treated and the viral aftermath, according to NY Daily News. It remains unclear whether police continued to press the charges against Golson. The case continues.","David Golson, 30, attempted to steal a Snickers bar from a Brooklyn 7-Eleven on October 17, 2012 .

Frodo might have to be put down because the wounds to his throat are so severe his heartbroken family are struggling to pay the . vet’s bills. Dawn Stevens, from Dalton in Cumbria, said her children, Amber, 11 and Dylan, nine, were walking the pet about 6.30pm when the attack happened. Dawn and her children, Dylan and Amber, cuddle up to Frodo, who suffered a nasty gash on his neck, after being attacked by another dog. The children have been left devastated by the attack . Mrs .

"By . Helen Lawson . A newly discovered interview with Martin Luther King from 1960 can be heard for the first time, with experts hailing the find for giving a glimpse into the civil rights leader's time in Africa. Raymond . Winbush, director of the Institute for Urban Research at Maryland's . Morgan State University, said the tape is significant because there are . very few recordings of King detailing his activity in Africa. He said: 'It's . clear that in this tape when he's talking ... about Africa, he saw this . as a global human rights movement that would inspire other . organizations, other nations, other groups around the world,' said . Winbush, who is also a psychologist and historian. 'That to me is what's remarkable about the tape.' Many . recordings of King are known to exist among hundreds of thousands of . documents related to his life that have been catalogued and archived. Scroll down to hear the interview . Rare: Martin Luther King Jr. speaks in Atlanta in 1960, the year the interview was recorded by Tull's father . But Winbush said this latest find is unusual because . there's little audio of King discussing his activities in Africa, while . two of King's contemporaries said it's exciting to hear a little-known . recording of their friend for the first time. The surprise and potentially lucrative discovery was made in Tennessee a few months ago. Stephon Tull was . looking through dusty old boxes in his father's attic in Chattanooga when he stumbled onto something startling: an audio reel . labeled, 'Dr. King interview, December 21, 1960'. He . wasn't sure what he had until he borrowed a friend's reel-to-reel . player and listened to the recording of his father interviewing Martin . Luther King Jr. for a book project that never came to fruition. In clear . audio, King discusses the importance of the civil rights movement, his . definition of nonviolence and how a recent trip of his to Africa . informed his views. Tull said the recording had been in the attic for . years, and he wasn't sure who other than his father may have heard it. 'No . words can describe. I couldn't believe it,' he told The Associated . Press in a phone interview from his home in Chattanooga. 'I . found ... a lost part of history.' Tull plans to offer the recording at a private sale arranged by a New York broker and collector later this month. Tull . said his father, an insurance salesman, had planned to write a book . about the racism he encountered growing up in Chattanooga and later as . an adult. He said his dad interviewed King when he visited the city, but . never completed the book and just stored the recording with some other . interviews he had done. Tull's father is now in his early 80s and under . hospice care. During part of the interview, King defines nonviolence and justifies its practice. 'I . would ... say that it is a method which seeks to secure a moral end . through moral means,' he said. 'And it grows out of the whole concept of . love, because if one is truly nonviolent that person has a loving . spirit, he refuses to inflict injury upon the opponent because he loves . the opponent.' The interview was made four . years before the Civil Rights Act became law, three years before King's . famous 'I Have a Dream' speech, and eight years before his . assassination. At one point in the interview, King predicts the impact . of the civil rights movement. Left to right: John Lewis, Martin Luther King Jr., Rev. Ralph Abernathy and James Farmer hold a news conference in Montgomery, Atlanta in May 1961 . 'I am convinced . that when the history books are written in future years, historians will . have to record this movement as one of the greatest epics of our . heritage,' he said. King had visited Africa . about a month before the interview, and he discusses with Tull's father . how leaders there viewed the racial unrest in the United States. 'I . had the opportunity to talk with most of the major leaders of the new . independent countries of Africa, and also leaders in countries that are . moving toward independence,' he said. 'And I think all of them agree . that in the United States we must solve this problem of racial injustice . if we expect to maintain our leadership in the world.' U.S. Rep. John Lewis, a Freedom Rider and lunch counter protester who worked . with King while a leader of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating . Committee, said hearing King talk about the sit-ins took him back to the . period when more than 100 restaurant counters were desegregated over . several months. 'To ... hear his voice and . listen to his words was so moving, so powerful,' said Lewis, adding that . King's principles of nonviolence are still relevant today. 'I wish people all over America, all over the world, can hear this message over and over again,' he said. The Rev. Joseph Lowery, who founded the Southern Christian Leadership Conference with King, agreed. 'I . can't think of anything better to try,' Lowery said of nonviolence. 'What we're doing now is not working. An eye for an eye, a tooth for a . tooth. Matching violence with violence. We've got more guns than we've . ever had, and more ammunition to go with it. And yet, the situation . worsens.' A spokeswoman for King's daughter . Bernice, head of The King Center in Atlanta, said she was traveling and . couldn't comment on the audio. Tull is working . with a New York-based collector and expert on historical artifacts to . arrange a sale. The broker, Keya Morgan, said he believes that . unpublished reel-to-reel audio of King is extremely rare and said he's . confident of the authenticity of the recording based on extensive . interviews with Tull, his examination of the tape and his knowledge of . King. He's collected many of the civil rights icon's letters and photos. 'I . was like, wow! To hear him that crisp and clear,' Morgan said. 'But . beyond that, for him to speak of nonviolence, which is what he . represented.' INTERVIEWER: 'In many of your writings, on your speeches, your talks, your lectures, you've used the term 'nonviolence' and 'Christian love,' what exactly does this mean?' DR. MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR.: 'Well, in short, I would say 'nonviolence' means the refusal to use violence in any way in order to achieve a social end. It means refusing to use external, physical violence, and also refusing to use internal violence of spirit. 'And I would also say that it is a method which seeks to secure a moral ends through moral means, and it rules out of the whole concept of love, because if one is truly nonviolent, that person has a loving spirit, he refuses to inflict injury upon the opponent, because he loves the opponent. 'And I think the two go together, that the idea of love is a basic part of the whole idea of nonviolence and vice versa.'INTERVIEWER: 'Doctor, you have visited Africa and many of our neighbors abroad, so exactly what effect, or rather, what reaction does the African have on the American Negro situation as it stands today in America and this country?' DR. KING: 'Well, there's quite a bit of interest and concern in Africa, or the situation in the United States. 'African leaders in general, and African people in particular are greatly concerned about the struggle here and they are quite familiar with what is taking place, I just returned from Africa a little more than a month ago, and I had the opportunity to talk with most of the major leaders of new, independent countries in Africa, and also, leaders in countries that are moving toward independence, and I think all of them agree that in the United States, we must solve this problem of racial injustice if we expect to maintain our leadership in the world, and if we expect to serve as a moral voice in a world that is two-thirds color.'","Audio of 1960 interview with the civil rights leader can be heard for first time .

He added that Elkann would 'always be one of my greatest loves and I only wish for him the very best in life' and in a third post described the style-savvy billionaire as 'the most incredible person I have ever known.' Claims: Fiat heir Lapo Elkann, pictured left in February, has accused celebrity chef Travis London, right, of stalking him, and lying in tweets in which he claimed the two had an affair . Twitter love: London said in a series of tweets, pictured, earlier this month, 'Lapo Elkann is a true creative and a great friend, a great man, and a GREAT lover' 'I want to thank him for loving me and allowing me to be crazy,' the chef, who has been romantically linked to Rihanna and Mary-Kate Olsen, went on. The tweets were later deleted, but not before The Dirty posted them. But Elkann has vehemently denied any affair and accused London of stalking him. Elkann told The New York Post's Page Six: 'The reality is he is a stalker, and he is someone who is obsessed with me ... Whatever he is saying ... is a nuisance and unreal. He has been stalking [me] for a year and a half.' Elkann even threatened to take legal action against the chef. London seemed to be shocked at the 37-year-old's hostile response.

"By . Steve Nolan . With hundreds of plastic legs, arms, and heads stacked high in boxes, it looks like a haunting resting place for hundreds of unwanted dolls discarded by girls who no longer want to play with them. But although Sydney's Famous Original Doll Hospital does have a cemetery for doll parts that are beyond repair, many of the toy parts littering the workshop are waiting to be given a new lease of life. For the company has been the saviour of hundreds of thousands of Australian girls devastated when their beloved doll has lost a limb or been damaged in an overly boisterous game and has revived millions of childhood memories. Centenary Spare doll's parts sit waiting to be used for repair at Sydney's Original Doll Hospital which is celebrating its 100th birthday this year . Concentrating: Gail Grainger works on a doll at Sydney's Original Doll Hospital in Bexley . Spare parts: Hundreds of spare dolls' arms and legs are kept in boxes at the hospital's workshop in Bexley, Sydney . Repairs: Doll body parts are hung up to dry after being painted at the workshop . The workshop is about to mark 100 years of repairing dolls after it was opened thanks to a shipping error in the Australian city back in 1913. And despite changing technology meaning that many modern children are more interested in the latest gadgets or computer games, the business is still going strong, with dolls sent from all over Australia and even across the sea from New Zealand for repair. The shop was founded by accident by Harold Chapman Snr in 1913. His brother was in the business of importing celluloid dolls from Japan but the rubber bands that held them together would often disintegrate and the dolls would be damaged. Waiting room: An old fashioned doll, or 'patient', sits waiting to be repaired in the Sydney Doll Hospital . Resting place: A sign saying 'The Doll's Cemetary' hangs over a section of the warehouse that is used for waste parts . Haunting: Spare dolls heads, some needed new paintwork, others needing repairs to their eyes, are piled high . Fortunately for his brother, Mr Chapman Snr found a way to fix the dolls and set up a section dedicated to doll repair in his general store. But demand for doll repair grew as word spread and the business was soon expanded. It was taken over by Mr Chapman Snr's son, also called Harold, in the 1930s and expanded the type of product being fixed to leather goods, toys and umbrellas. The start of World War Two really saw the doll hospital thrive however. Restrictions on manufacturing and importing goods to Australia meant that children and collectors had to make do with their old dolls instead of buying new ones and more repairs were needed. Getting a spruce up: Gail Grainger works on making the torso of a doll look the part before its limbs are reattached . Accidental beginnings: The Doll Hospital was opened after founder Harold Chapman Snr's brother ordered celluloid dolls from Japan which were damaged in transit . Labour of love: Current Hospital owner Geoff Chapman, the third generation of the Chapman family to run it, is pictured in the workshop . At one point during the war the hospital had 70 'nurses' working in six different repair rooms. By its 95th birthday, the hospital had carried out a staggering 2.5mllion repairs. Now, the hospital has been passed onto its third generation of the Chapman family, with Harold Jnr's son Geoff now in charge. He said on the company's website: 'There is nothing more satisfying than seeing the smile on a little girl's face when she comes to collect her beloved doll. 'People often have tears in their eyes when they have to leave their precious dolls, but tears of joy when they come to collect them and see the transformation.' Thriving: Business really boomed during World War Two when restrictions on manufacturing and importing goods meant that new dolls were hard to come by . For sale: As well as repairing dolls, the hospital also has a range for sale .

"By . Anthony Bond . Controversial: Russia's President Vladimir Putin has rejected criticism of the imprisonment of the female punk band Pussy Riot by claiming 'they would be at home doing housework' if they had not 'broken the law' Russia's President Vladimir Putin has rejected criticism of the imprisonment of the female punk band Pussy Riot by claiming 'they would be at home doing housework if they had not broken the law'. Speaking to a group of foreign Russian experts, Putin said the bands three members deserved their fate because they threatened the moral foundations of Russia. During the two-hour dinner, the president, now in his 13th . year running Russia, became animated only when asked about the band. According to The Independent, Putin said: 'Whether the sentence was too much or too little is not for me to . judge,' he said. 'That is a matter for the court.' He added: 'If they had not broken the law, they would now . be at home, doing the housework, or back at their jobs.' Maria Alyokhina, 24, and Nadezhda Tolokonnikova, 22, were convicted of . ‘hooliganism motivated by religious hatred’ in August, after they burst . into a cathedral to protest against Vladmir Putin. They were sentenced to two years in jail for the stunt, a punishment that many in the West said was too harsh. A third convicted band member, Yekaterina Samutsevich, was released on . appeal when a court suspended her sentence after her lawyer argued that . she had been pulled away from the cathedral's altar before the protest . song began. At yesterday's dinner Putin asked why Westerners who criticized Russia for sending . two of the young women to labor camps far from Moscow had not come out . in support of a jailed American who made an anti-Muslim hate film. 'Do . you want to support people with such views? If you do, then why do you . not support the guy who is sitting in prison for the film about the . Muslims?' the president shot back. This . was an apparent reference to 'The Innocence of Muslims', a hate . video that triggered violent protests across the Islamic world when it . was aired on the Internet. Jailed: Members of Pussy Riot sit in a glass-walled cage during a court hearing in Moscow earlier this year. Nadezhda Tolokonnikova, right, Maria Alyokhina, centre, and Yekaterina Samutsevich left, are pictured . An . actress in the film has identified an Egyptian-born Californian, Mark . Basseley Youssef, as its author. Youssef is currently detained on . suspicion of violating his probation terms for a bank fraud conviction. 'We . have red lines beyond which starts the destruction of the moral . foundations of our society,' Putin went on. 'If people cross this line . they should be made responsible in line with the law.' He described Pussy Riot's protest as 'an act of group sex aimed at hurting religious feelings'. Putin's . comments came amid a wider clampdown on dissent in Russia, which has . included arrests of opposition leaders on criminal charges and tighter . controls on media. This . has led to fears that the political system, which is highly centralized . under the Kremlin, is becoming increasingly ossified and intolerant. Sent away: Alekhina and Tolokonnikova were transferred from a Moscow prison, pictured, to remote camps over the weekend . Putin's comments were made during a seven-course meal with the Valdai Club of foreign journalists . and academics at his Stalin-era residence in a wooded compound outside . Moscow. The Valdai . members were kept waiting in a separate room for an hour and a half for . the meeting, while Putin met a group of factory workers and teachers . from the Volga region to discuss religious cults. Putin spent most of his time carefully explaining how his country was trying to improve the business climate and diversify the economy away from its heavy dependence on oil and gas by promoting high-tech industries. The Kremlin chief said he had 'mixed feelings' about a $55 billion state-sponsored takeover of the country's number three private oil producer TNK-BP last week because it increased state-controlled Rosneft's domination of the energy sector. But Putin said he acted to help BP and put an end to 'fistfights' between the British oil major and its four Soviet-born oligarch partners. 'We tried not to get involved, but when BP managers came to me and the government and said we want to cooperate with Rosneft, we could not say no,' said Putin. Rosneft is run by a longtime close Putin ally, Igor Sechin, and the deal will give BP a stake of nearly 20 per cent. Outrage: Pussy Riot members clad in balaclavas stage their protest inside Christ The Saviour Cathedral in Moscow in February . Putin said he was implementing new laws and reforming the courts to reach a target of moving Russia up from its 112th place in the annual World Bank rankings for ease of doing business - below Pakistan - to a top 20 place by 2018. Putin deflected a question about the possible stagnation of the system by saying Russia was re-introducing direct elections for state governors, making it easier for political parties to register and allowing citizens to petition the state Duma (parliament) directly with proposals. Many of the same faces who worked with Putin when he was deputy mayor of St Petersburg in the early 1990s are still in senior positions in Moscow in the government and in state companies. But Putin said around two-thirds of the members of the government had been changed when he returned to the Kremlin earlier this year, swapping places with his protégé Dmitry Medvedev, who is now prime minister. 'I prefer to choose qualified, experienced people who have proved they can do well,' the president explained. He rejected suggestions that there were any disputes inside the government in the wake of the departure just over a year ago of long-time Finance Minister Alexei Kudrin. Putin insisted that Russia would continue to give a high priority to growing its trade with its top business partner China, aiming to boost bilateral business to $100 billion a year from current levels of $83.5 billion. Beijing and Moscow were also keen to do as much trade as possible in their national currencies, he said, noting that the rouble was fully convertible and that it was a 'matter of time' until the yuan was, too. By contrast, he berated the European Union for its 'ridiculous' slowness in agreeing a visa-free regime for Russia and attacked Brussels for not taking him up on an offer of cooperation on a new satellite navigation system between the European Galileo system and Russia's GLONASS project. 'The EU has a visa-free regime with certain Latin American countries, and I don't think their crime levels are any less than ours,' he said. 'I don't understand this approach.' Locked up: Band member Maria Alyokhina smiles to her supporters as she is delivered to Khamovnichesky district court  in Moscow, Russia . Putin also had a ready answer for a questioner who enquired how he would stop an exodus of talented, qualified young people to the West. It was entirely normal, he said, for young people to study and work in other countries where there was more money or a good education on offer. And what would the president want historians to highlight as the greatest achievement of his third term in the Kremlin? 'You know, I am never guided by a possible assessment of my work,' Putin said, before highlighting how the economy had doubled in size under his stewardship, average incomes had soared, gold reserves were the world's fourth biggest, the birth rate had increased - all what he termed 'modest, positive changes ... but not enough'. 'We need to create a democratic, effective system of governance so that people feel they are participating,' he said. 'We need to create an effective economy which is looking forward and to guarantee the country's security. I am sure we are capable of solving all these problems.'","Putin said the bands three members deserved their fate because .

"By . William  Cook . Faces jail: Amanda Wheeler drunk vodka, beer and wine before molesting two schoolboys at a friend's 50th birthday . A mother-of-three who drank enough to 'knock out a bull elephant' faces jail after molesting two schoolboys at a friend’s 50th birthday party. Amanda Wheeler, 31, kissed and groped a 12-year-old boy on a bench, rubbed her breasts against teenagers she was dancing with at the party and performed sex acts on two boys in a bedroom. Worcester Crown Court heard the part-time cleaner had been drinking vodka, beer and wine throughout the evening. A jury found Wheeler, from Barbourne in Worcester, guilty of four counts of sexual activity with a child and one of sexual assault. She was acquitted of a sixth charge of sexual activity with a child, the maximum sentence for which is 14 years in prison. Judge Patrick Thomas QC granted her bail while pre-sentence and psychological reports were prepared. He said it was 'a very difficult case' but added he had not yet considered what sentence he should pass. During the two-week trial, the jury heard Wheeler drank vodka, wine and beer before attending the 50th birthday bash in November last year. On her way there, she kissed and groped a 12-year-old boy on a bench. On arrival she started 'dirty dancing' a group of teenagers, asking one boy for sex and rubbing herself against the shocked teens. After midnight Wheeler molested two boys, aged 13 . and 14, in a bedroom. The jury was told she pulled the 14-year-old’s trousers down before . performing a sex act on him, and forced a 13-year-old to carry out a sex act on her while his private parts were exposed. James Dunstan, prosecuting, said Wheeler’s behaviour that night had been 'highly flirtatious' while she was trapped 'in a drunken bubble'. In a video interview with police the 13-year-old boy said Wheeler pounced on him and his 12-year-old friend after plying them with strong Stella Artois lager. He claimed the trio left her home to go to a party nearby but stopped to sit on a bench in a field. The victim told officers Wheeler hugged the younger boy 'in a friendly way', before she 'tried to snog him'. The boy, who is now 14, said she then turned to him, tried to pull down his trousers and bit his neck. He said she told him she wanted to perform a sex act on him, which made him feel 'disgusted'. Guilty: Wheeler was found guilty of four counts of sexual activity with a child and one of sexual assault at Worcester Crown Court (pictured) Later at the birthday party the boy said he saw Wheeler 'dirty dancing' with a 15-year-old and asking him for sex, but he refused. The boy said she then moved over to him and rubbed her breasts on his chest and stomach, before nuzzling his neck and hugging him. One of the victims told the court he asked Wheeler to stop but she refused and he did not want to push her and hurt her so let her carry on. Wheeler, who had denied all the offences, told the jury she had an alcohol problem and was taking tablets for depression. Samantha Forsyth, defending said Wheeler had been 'monumentally stupid' after drinking enough to 'knock out a bull elephant'. Wheeler will be sentenced at Birmingham Crown Court in January. She was also ordered to sign the Sex Offenders’ Register.","Amanda Wheeler plied 12-year-old boy and his friend with lager before kissing him on a bench .

"Stewart Parvin also tells how the monarch wears an extra shoulder pad to look good . According to the royal dress designer said the coolness of her skin keeps her clothes perfectly pressed . By . Eleanor Harding . The secret of why the Queen never looks anything other than cool and immaculate has been revealed – Her Majesty does not perspire. According to royal dress designer Stewart Parvin, she is generally a 'cold person' – in terms of body temperature. He explained that the coolness of her skin keeps the clothes perfectly pressed – accounting for her impeccable appearance at all times. No glow:  The queen does not sweat, according to her dress designer Stewart Parvin . Standing out:  The queen will often wear bright colours in order to help her visible among a crowd . It was one of a number of the Queen’s wardrobe secrets revealed by 45-year-old Mr Parvin, who designs her outfits for official occasions. ‘We always choose fabrics that don’t crease – we go to extra lengths to line them so they don’t,’ he said. 'I am somebody who creases all their clothes. I’m always hot. The Queen is very lucky – she doesn’t crease her clothes. ‘The clothes are always impeccable. But it is also that she doesn’t glow. If you are a cold person your clothes don’t crease.’ Mr Parvin, who has been working with the Queen since 2000, described the techniques his team use to keep her looking perfect. As one of Her Majesty’s shoulders is higher than the other, she wears an extra shoulder-pad. Eye for design:  Stewart Parvin has been the Queen's dress designer for the past 11 years . Comfort:  The Queen has a servant wear her shoes in before she puts them on, according to Mr Parvin . And a servant with the same sized feet usually wears her shoes in for her to save her toes from blistering. Mr Parvin told the Sunday Times: ‘[The shoes] have to be immediately comfortable … she does get someone to wear them. The Queen can never say, “I’m uncomfortable, I can’t walk any more”.’ To ensure that no outfit appears in public too many times, or in the same company, each dress is recorded on a spread sheet with the time and date it was worn. The Queen is apparently keen to adopt ‘outrageous designs and bright colours’ such as pink and yellow, Mr Parvin said. He added that block colours ‘elongate her; she’s only very tiny’. For Her Majesty, practicality always comes first – which is why she favours dresses rather than skirts and blouses which can become untucked. Mr Parvin added: ‘There is always someone there photographing her. So when she gets out of a car, she can’t pull her skirt up, tuck her shirt in, tighten her things; she gets out and she’s ready.’","Stewart Parvin also tells how the monarch wears an extra shoulder pad to look good .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . The widow of an Army veteran was forced to call in the bomb squad after finding four live hand grenades her late husband had stashed in their attic. Caroline Cyganiak had been going through her late husband Fabian's military gear in the attic of their home when she found the decades-old hand grenades in an ammo tin. 'It scared the living daylights out of me,' she told Fox 6 Now. 'I didn't know if they could explode or not.' 'It scared the living daylights out of me': Caroline Cyganiak, left, discovered the live hand grenades stashed among uniforms and military memorabilia belonging to her late husband Fabian, right, who died last year . After she dialled 911, police in Oak Creek, Wisconsin, called in the bomb squad from the Milwaukee County Sheriff's Office who found that the anti-personnel bombs were not only live, but also unstable. Experts safely removed the grenades from Mrs Cyganiak's home but, such was the danger, they judged that the weapons had to be destroyed immediately before any accidents could happen. They rushed the grenades to a remote spot that night and blew them up in two controlled explosions, which were so loud they led to dozens of emergency calls from frightened people nearby. Mrs Cyganiak had found the hand grenades while going through her husband's old Army uniforms, a job the grieving widow had been putting off since he passed away last year. She said that they had been there for about 42 years. Surprise surprise: The four grenades, which Mrs Cyganiak said were about 42 years old, had been stashed in this ammo tin and kept among her late husband's old uniforms. She is baffled as to why he kept them up there . Oak Creek Police Chief John Edwards said that if the grenades had exploded the resulting blast would have been disastrous. 'I’m sure that they would have damaged that house extensively and probably injured anyone within a radius. That’s what they’re meant to do. They are weapons of war,' he said. Mrs Cyganiak said her husband was 'proud' of his time in the military, but she has nevertheless been left baffled as to why he decided to keep so much explosive ordinance among his mementoes. 'Today I went to the cemetery and I really reamed him out,' she chuckled.","Caroline Cyganiak found the 42-year-old grenades stashed in an ammo tin .

"By . Lizzie Parry . A Halloween fan who put up a gruesome display of 'disembowelled corpses' outside his home has been asked by police to tone it down. James Creighton, 25, was told that his scene was making children cry with its macabre reconstruction of a scene from The Texas Chainshaw Massacre. He has put the display up outside his house in Stevenage to raise funds for charity every year since his grandmother died in 2009. James Creighton was 'shocked' when police officers knocked on the door of his Stevenage home. He creates the annual display to raise money for Cancer Research UK in memory of his gran Betty, who died in 2009 . But one parent complained to Hertfordshire Constabulary, concerned that the collection of 'bloody corpses and gory skeletons' was scaring young children. But Mr Creighton said: 'I can't believe it to be honest. I can't see what I've done wrong.' The decorations were assembled outside the front of his home at the start of the month to support Cancer Research UK. The annual fundraiser is held in memory of Mr Creighton's beloved grandmother Betty, who died of cancer in 2009. But on Tuesday, Mr Creighton received a visit from two police officers who asked that he make the set 'less frightening'. An angry parent complained to police that the gruesome display was reducing children to tears . 'When the police turned up I don't think they knew what to say,' he said. 'They told me there had been a complaint and that I needed to ""tone it down"" by taking some decorations down. 'I'm told someone walks by with young children and they are crying every time they see it. 'The police told me they want me to put a black tarpaulin across the bottom of the fence so children can't see it, but it spoils it for everyone else then. 'It's not something I want to do to be honest. I will admit some of the things I've added to the house this year are quite gory - but that's the whole point of Halloween. 'I always get young children saying ""mummy look at that house"" and everyone seems to love it.' He's now hoping to save what he can of his stomach-churning pride and joy. 'I'm sure if the parent had come and spoken to me we could have come to a compromise,' insisted Mr Creighton. 'I don't know why they felt the need to go to the police about it. It's so ridiculous it's almost funny.' Last October he raised £1,150 for the charity through donations and he has already collected more than £700 so far this year. Mr Creighton designs a terrifying Halloween display each year to raise money for Cancer Research UK in memory of his gran Betty, who died from the disease in 2009 . 'I've been doing it for quite a few years and I've got a big Cancer Research UK banner outside, so everyone knows what it's for,' he added. 'I've always loved Halloween and decorating the house was something that my nan and mum did for me when I was younger. 'So now I'm carrying it on in my nan's memory and just trying to do my best for her and the charity - it's an excellent cause.' A Hertfordshire Police spokesman said: 'We have visited a resident of Grove Road in Stevenage concerning a Halloween display in his garden, following a complaint from a member of the public.

"By . James Gordon . A cinema has infuriated movie-goers after armed guards were present at a showing of 'Lee Daniels' The Butler'. There was an 'abnormally heavy' level of security at the Regal Cinemas Majestic Stadium movie theater in Silver Spring, Maryland, according to a visitor on Saturday. A woman called Tiffany Flowers took to Twitter the next day to express her 'utter disgust' at the treatment of movie-goers.

The Butler: As Cecil Gaines serves eight presidents during his tenure as a butler at the White House, the civil rights movement, Vietnam, and other major events affect this man's life, family, and American society . It appeared to her that the security presence  was confined to the showing of 'The Butler' at which the majority of the audience was black. Through her Tweets, she explained that the theater checked customers tickets twice before being met by a guard who told them where to sit. But the police activity didn't end there. Ms. Flowers went on to add that armed guards faced the crowd whilst the film was being shown. 'The almost entirely black audience of 'The Butler' was subjected to watching the film while armed guards faced the audience,' she wrote. 'Why?' Spanning more than 50 years of history and a series of presidents, The Butler spotlights the US civil rights struggle through the life and career of a White House servant. Inspired by Eugene Allen, who held the post for 34 years, the film is already seen as a serious contender for the Oscars. Director Lee Daniels, known for Precious and The Paperboy, used Allen’s persona to create a character called Cecil Gaines, played by Forest Whitaker. Through Gaines, viewers are taken from cotton fields in segregationist Georgia to the election of Barack Obama as America’s first black president in 2008. Allen died in 2010 at the age of 90. The publicity tour for the film has featured heavy discussion of race, and the film’s relevance to current events, including racial profiling in general. The film was in the number one spot at the box office at the weekend bringing in $25 million. Success: Lee Daniels' The Butler made $25 million at the box office this past weekend .

'When a theater experiences sold out showings of any feature, security will assist with crowd control and guest assistance throughout the facility, including auditoriums . 'This weekend our Majestic theater experienced a tremendous guest response to the feature the ‘Lee Daniels’ The Butler’ such that additional showtimes were added to meet our guests demands. 'At no time did local management receive any guest complaints or concerns about our security or staff, who worked diligently to meet all of our guests needs. 'To the extent any guests were disappointed with their experience, we welcome the opportunity to address their concerns and provide them the best entertainment experience possible in their future visits to our theaters.' The cinema's controversial policy came as box office figures put The Butler in the number one position. Starring Whitaker as a longtime White House butler and Oprah Winfrey as his boozy wife, the Weinstein Co. biopic debuted in the top spot with $25 million, according to studio estimates on Sunday. But the weekend's three other major new releases, including the action romp Kick-Ass 2, failed to find traction with fans. 'We expected to do well, but we didn't expect to do this well,' said Erik Lomis, president of distribution and home entertainment for Weinstein Co., adding that The Butler is the company's first No. 1 debut since 2009's Inglourious Basterds.","Armed guards in the lobby of Regal Cinema on Saturday in Silver Spring, Maryland .

"By . Tahira Yaqoob . A British businesswoman facing three years in a Dubai jail could not have had sex in the back of a taxi because she was on her period, her lawyer told a court today. Rebecca Blake, a £100,000-a-year recruitment consultant, is accused of stripping naked in the back of a Dubai cab and writhing on top of Irishman Conor McRedmond. Her lawyer Shaker Al Shammary told Dubai Misdemeanours Court the taxi driver made a malicious false accusation after rowing with Mr McRedmond over the fare. Mr Al Shammary also claimed the driver's account was inconsistent. Accused: Rebecca Blake, 29, left, and Conor McRedmond, 28, right, deny having sex in the back of a Dubai taxi in May, but do admit to indulging in an all-day drinking binge . The pair were also charged with consuming alcohol after admitting to a 10-hour drinking binge on the day of their arrest. Mr Al Shammary told the court: 'This is Dubai, not a mosque. Everyone drinks.' Ms Blake, 29, of Dorking, Surrey, and welder Mr McRedmond, 28, from Tullamore, County Offaly, were arrested on May 4 after meeting for the first time earlier that day in a hotel bar. Pakistani taxi driver Qaiser Khan, 29, said he picked the couple up at around 11pm after their all-day drinking binge, which had started with midday brunch and unlimited drinks. Facing jail: Ms Blake (second right) and Mr McRedmond (left) chat with their lawyer Shaker Al Shammary (second left) and Ms Blake's sister Natasha Todd (far right) outside the Dubai Courts ahead their hearing today . During the journey Mr Khan said he looked in his rear view mirror and noticed Ms Blake had taken her top off. She was straddling Mr McRedmond and was 'moaning for two minutes and making the sounds of a woman having sex', according to police records. He pulled over on Sheikh Zayed road when he spotted a police patrol car. He then asked Emirati policeman Abdullah Obaid Khamis, 22, to, 'Come and see what they are doing.' The officer said he found the pair having sex in the car and interrupted them by tapping on the window, the court heard. Move: Ms Blake moved to Dubai last September and worked for Manpower recruitment firm until she was sacked . after the incident in May . Lawyer, Mr Al Shammary asked for the sex and indecency charges to be dropped saying: 'The driver's testimony to police officers contradicts his testimony to prosecutors. My clients' testimonies have remained the same during police and prosecution investigations.' He added the couple both denied having naked sex and were backed by police forensic reports, which came back negative when they were tested for evidence of intercourse. Ms Blake, who moved to Dubai in September last year and worked for Manpower recruitment firm until she was sacked after the incident in May, has said: 'I'm no saint. The whole incident was a blur.' She began drinking at a £35-a-head hotel brunch with free-flowing wine, then indulged in a happy hour at the bar before moving to the Irish Village pub with Mr McRedmond. The pair left the bar at 10.30pm. Mr Al Shammary said: 'They took a taxi outside a hotel and (Mr McRedmond) had an argument with the taxi driver about the fare because he saw the driver had taken him the long way round. He told him he would report him to the police. 'My clients live here and they know Dubai so they knew the quickest route. The taxi driver saw he was drunk and thought he should go to the police before he had a chance to complain. As soon as he saw a police car he pulled over and said they were having sex. 'When the officer came over, they had their clothes on and were not doing anything. The witness statements do not tally. He added: 'There was no proof they had sex and (Ms Blake) had her period so they could not have done. They are adults who know what they are doing so they could have had sex in a hotel if they had wanted to. Why bother in a taxi?' Outrage: The couple's lawyer Shaker Al Shammary told Dubai Misdemeanours Court the taxi driver made a malicious false accusation after rowing with Mr McRedmond over the fare . In a statement to police, Mr Khan said the couple asked him to take them to Al Barsha area, then kept changing their minds. 'They kept asking me to go left and right and finally asked me to go to the marina. I noticed the man was drinking and told him it was not allowed to have alcohol inside the taxi but he drank it and threw the bottle out of the window,' Mr Khan told police. 'The next thing, I looked in the mirror and saw the woman sitting on the man's thighs. She was naked, moving up and down and making sounds.' Mr Khan said when the policeman arrived on the scene Blake had offered him 'a lot of money' to say they were kissing rather than having sex. 'I refused and told the truth during the investigation,' he told police. According to court records, the policeman - who has yet to appear before the judge - said he saw Ms Blake naked and writhing on Mr McRedmond's lap. 'They kept having sex for four minutes and then I knocked on the glass so they stopped and got dressed. The man's shirt was open, his trousers were down to his knees and the woman was not wearing any underwear,' he said. He added Ms Blake cried when she was arrested and said she wanted to go home. Ms Blake admitted drinking four glasses of vodka and five glasses of white wine but told prosecutors when she was arrested that Mr McRedmond was only hugging her. Mr McRedmond admitted to drinking 'six or seven' vodka drinks. Both defendants have been released on bail. The sex and indecency charges each carry a jail term of between one month and three years while consumption of alcohol is punishable by up to six months in jail and a fine of up to £340. The case was adjourned until November 22.

"By . Katherine Faulkner . and Andy Dolan . and John Stevens . Updated: . 20:53 EST, 24 January 2012 . Most women dream of winning the lottery, hitting the stores and buying a whole new wardrobe.But the mother of two who has scooped the latest £40million EuroMillions jackpot bucked the trend yesterday by declaring: ‘I hate shopping.’ Catherine Bull, 35, will, however, splash out on one particular luxury – a new  carpet for her upstairs landing, because the current one is in a ‘terrible’ state. The purchase will leave plenty of change from the £40,627,241 she and husband Gareth won in the draw on Friday night. Lottery joy: Gareth and Catherine Bull revealed today they haven't yet told their two sons that they scooped almost £41million on the Euromillions last Friday . Asked if she planned to go shopping with her winnings, horrified Mrs Bull said she couldn’t think of anything worse. ‘I have never been much of a shopper and I can’t see that changing now,’ she said. ‘I already have home food delivery from Tesco because I hate . shopping. ‘And I have no style sense – I usually wear leggings and jeans. I want a . new upstairs landing carpet. It’s terrible – nobody is allowed to go . upstairs.’ Despite their huge win the Nottinghamshire couple say they have ‘no plans’ to quit work or move out of their home. Huge win: Gareth and Catherine Bull scooped almost £41million on the EuroMillions last Friday . Sealed with a kiss: Mr and Mrs Bull, from Mansfield, Nottinghamshire, are presented with their winner's cheque today . Mr Bull, a self-employed builder, bought the ticket on a whim after he was unable to work one day because it was raining. The 40-year-old only realised the following morning that they had hit the jackpot. Where they live now: Mrs Bull said she already has her dream home and her ambitions only stretch as far as buying a new carpet after they scooped almost £41million . Joy: Mr and Mrs Bull have pledged to support breast cancer charities with their winnings after her mother was hit by the disease five years ago . Toasting their success: The first thing Mr and Mrs Bull bought was an iPad - but said they have been so busy they have not even switched it on . Their new £41m fortune may have made them as rich as Kylie Minogue, but Gareth and Catherine Bull are relatively poor when compared with other jumbo jackpot winners. Their prize is only the seventh biggest won in the UK. Colin . and Chris Weir, from Largs, Scotland, scooped £161m last July, another anonymous ticket holder collected £113m and Dave and Angela Dawes scooped £101m in October. The fourth-biggest prize winner in the UK won £84million in May 2010 on the EuroMillions. In February 2010, Nigel Page and Justine Laycock, from Gloucestershire, broke the then record with a £56million win – now the fifth-biggest prize in the history of EuroMillions. The sixth-biggest payout went to Les and Sam Scadding in South Wales who won £45millon in November 2009. Overseas, the biggest ever single win was the £195million Andrew Whittaker pocketed in West Virginia, U.S., in 2002.

Larry and Nancy Ross from Michigan and Joe . and Sue Kainz from Illinois shared the £232m jackpot from The Big Game . in May 2000. Yesterday afternoon Mrs Bull – who works in health insurance – said they . were still so shocked they had not even told sons Joel, ten, and . Declan, nine, about their good fortune. Incredibly, the couple carried on with their weekend plans as normal, . taking the boys to play in football matches and hosting a birthday . sleepover. The couple said their younger son would tell them off for buying lottery . tickets. ‘He always tells me it’s a waste of money,’ Mrs Bull laughed. ‘He might have something to say about that now.’ Mr Bull built his family’s six bedroom, six bathroom house in Mansfield himself. The couple said it was already their ‘dream home’ and they did not want . to move. But they said they would consider buying a holiday home abroad – . and would treat their boys to a family holiday in Disneyland Florida. Mr Bull would like splash out on a box at Old Trafford to watch his . beloved Manchester United. The couple also want to support charities . with their new-found millions, particularly breast cancer research. Mr . Bull’s mother Edith suffered with the disease around five years ago and . has since recovered. Last night, friends said the couple had ‘worked hard all their lives’ and deserved the money.  Neighbour Sam Giles, 42, said Mr Bull was a . ‘good, hard-working’ bloke. Friend Della Needham, 37, described Mr Bull as a ‘devoted family man’ and Mrs Bull as a fitness fanatic. She added: ‘‘I’m just really happy it . has happened to such a good couple.’ Winners: Mr Bull, 40, bought the ticket because he couldn't carry out a building job because it was raining .","Gareth and Catherine Bull HAVEN'T told their two sons, aged nine and 10 .

"By . Ruth Styles . From misspelled words to Chinese characters used at random and Hindi 'phrases' that are really gibberish, not every inking turns out as expected. Now it seems that getting rid of an unwanted tattoo has pitfalls of its own as Elspeth, a 29-year-old sales manager discovered when she attempted to have hers removed. Instead of erasing her unwanted etching, botched laser surgery left her skin badly burned while failing to make any difference to the tattoo itself. Not happy: Elspeth was badly burned and left with terrible scarring after laser tattoo removal went wrong . 'I imagine that for some people it would be a small problem but for me, it's quite big,' she explains. 'I'm trying to make it in my career and I constantly see people looking at it when I wear skirts and high heels.' Elspeth's tattoo trouble began at the age of 19 when, in a moment of teenage madness, she decided to get some permanent art etched on her ankle. Days later, she realised she had made a catastrophic mistake and decided to get the offending tattoo removed. 'I felt it was tacky,' she explains, 'so I started to get it lasered but after a few sessions, it [the tattoo] got really, really bad.' Botched: Elspeth's problems began after a bungling surgeon burned her leg while trying to remove her tattoo . Hidden: Elspeth has to use medical concealer to hide the tattoo - which has resisted all attempts to remove it . Getting better: Elspeth is embarking on a new course of laser surgery and hopes to be rid of it one day . Despite her concerns, the woman in charge reassured her that pain and scabbing were normal so Elspeth continued to attend appointments. But things were about to get worse. 'It got infected, to the point that skin was dropping off,' she reveals. 'I . really should have gone to the GP but I just trusted this woman. It . became a horrible combination of scar, burn, tattoo, everything in one.' Now Elspeth is to appear on TLC show Extreme Beauty Disasters in a bid to finally remove the offending etching, which, thanks to the scarring, has so far resisted every subsequent attempt to remove it. So bad is the scarring left by the botched lasering, Elspeth has had to resort to cosmetic camouflage - a type of concealer originally created for burns victims - to hide it. Speaking about the camouflage, Elspeth adds: 'I really love it. I feel like I've gone back 10 years. It's liberating to be able to stand without having to try and camouflage it. 'Camouflage took a while to master but . I'm very grateful they taught me to do it. I've used it for weddings and . business meetings. It's given me a lot of confidence.' She has also embarked on a new course of laser therapy, this time with a reputable professional and hopes, one day, to be able to give up the body paint. 'I'm really excited to see the results,' she adds. 'In a few week's time, I'm sure I will see less and less ink. 'I'm looking forward to stopping the camouflage, as happy as I was with it. It's too difficult to put on every day so I'm hoping that at some point in the future, I'll be able to go out again and just show off my legs.' Elspeth appears on Extreme Beauty Disasters, Thursday night at 8pm on TLC .","Elspeth, 29, left with an indestructible tattoo following botched lasering .

"By . Lucy Waterlow . Finland's glamorous entrant in this year's Eurovision Song Contest plans to 'make a statement' about her country's ban on gay marriage during her performance. Krista Siegfrids, 27, will perform 'Marry Me' at the competition in Sweden on Saturday 18 May and said she is planning a 'surprise' at the end of her routine. In a previous performance of her song at a Eurovision concert in Amsterdam last week, which you can view below, she shocked the audience by kissing one of her female backing dances. Scroll down for video . Planning a surprise: Krista Siegfrids said she wants to 'make a statement' during her Eurovision performance . A gay kiss broadcast across Europe on the night of the contest would cause a huge controversy for the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) as it would draw outrage from some homophobic quarters of Eastern Europe. But Krista said they won't be able to stop her. 'Homophobic people are . angry with me for doing this. But I'm planning a surprise at the end of . my performance. It's live on TV, so nobody can stop me,' she said in the Independent on Sunday. Supporting gay marriage: The singer kissed a female backing dancer during a previous performance . Singing for victory: Political statements are not allowed in the contest but the Finnish entrant said her song is about 'love and tolerance' The rules of the Eurovision Contest state that 'no lyrics, speeches, gestures of a political or similar nature shall be permitted during the ESC'. They add: 'The lyrics and/or performance of the songs shall not bring the Shows, the ESC as such or the EBU into disrepute.' The lyrics of Krista's catchy dance song, which she performs in a wedding dress, refer to a woman wanting her boyfriend to propose to her. Krista said: 'I don't think 'Marry Me' is political. It's about love and tolerance. But gay marriage is not . allowed in Finland and that's wrong. I wanted to make a statement about . that.' Spectacle: Her performance will involve her wearing a bridal gown with a 'surprise' at the end . Finland created same-sex civil partnerships in 2002 but same-sex marriage is not recognised by law. Earlier this year, thousands of Finnish people flocked to sign a petition on equal marriage rights calling on politicians to take a vote on the issue. According to Yle, Finland's national public-broadcasting company: 'Public enthusiasm for the petition was . so great that the Ministry of Justice's civic proposal website . kansalaisaloite.fi crashed as a result of the overwhelming demand.' 'I want to get everyone's support': The popstar hopes she can count on votes from Britain . However, Krista won't be able to count on votes from her compatriots to help her win Eurovision and spread her message on equal marriage rights further because viewers aren't allowed to vote for their own country's entry. Instead she hopes she can count on British support to propel her to victory. She said: 'Since you can't vote . for your own entry, I hope you will vote for Finland. I know the show is . watched on huge screens in gay bars in Soho and I want to get . everyone's support in Britain.' The Eurovision Song Contest will be broadcast on BBC1 from 8pm on Saturday 18 May hosted by Graham Norton. The UK's entrant is 80s pop sensation Bonnie Tyler, 61. Referring to her own chance of success, Bonnie said: 'It's a tricky one the Eurovision Song Contest because it's not all about the music, is it?'","Singer Krista Siegfrids, 27, said she plans to 'make a statement'

"By . Damian Ghigliotty . The infamous mother of four who admitted to running a prostitution ring in New York has been sentenced to six months in jail followed by five years probation. U.S. prosecutors said Anna Gristina, a native of Edinburgh, Scotland, living in Monroe, New York, was the madam of a Manhattan sex service for 15 years. The 45-year-old mother first claimed she ran a dating service, but later admitted to the single charge of promoting prostitution as part of a plea deal at Manhattan Supreme Court on September 26. 'Manhattan Madam' gets sentenced: Anna Gristina sits in the Manhattan Supreme Court with her attorney Norman Pattis on November 20, 2012 . Media magnet: Gristina leaves the New York State Supreme Court with her husband and attorney after receiving her jail sentence . 'Sense of relief': Kelvin Gorr, Gristina's husband, speaks to the media as he leaves the Manhattan Supreme Court after her sentencing in New York . When Acting Supreme Court Justice Juan Merchan asked Gristina if she had anything to say in court on Tuesday, November 20, she replied, 'It's probably better that I don't, Your Honor.' Merchan handed Gristina the six-month jail term followed by five years probation, the District Attorney`s Office said. She may now be deported as a result of the conviction. Her sentence stems from an incident in July 2011 when authorities say Gristina set up a rendezvous between two female prostitutes and an undercover police officer posing as a client. Prosecutors from the Manhattan District Attorney's office caught her on tape arranging for the officer to watch the two prostitutes have sex in her E. 78th St. brothel. Gristina was arrested in February as she was leaving a fundraising meeting for her business, prosecutors said. Jail time: Gristina, who pleaded guilty in September to promoting a high-end, sex-for-pay prostitution ring, was sentenced to six months in jail with an additional five years' probation . She spent nearly four months in jail on Riker's Island and was released in June on a $250,000 US dollar (£157,000) bond. Prosecutors said their five-year investigation revealed that Gristina netted an estimated $10 million (£6.4 million) from her business, which was said to include a roster of wealthy clients. Despite her plea, she insists she never crossed the . line, and blames her friends and alleged accomplice Janie Mae Baker for . turning on her. 'Sometimes people get great deals for being state’s witnesses, for . being rats,' her defense attorney Norman Pattis said in court on Tuesday. 'I think in . this case Ms. Baker decide to flip and roll over to get a deal.' Pattis said Gristina had entertained the thought of recanting her plea in favor of going to trial. Done deal: Gristina's attorney Pattis, left, walks next to her husband Gorr, right, as they leave the Manhattan Supreme Court after her sentencing . Gristina resides with her family on a 12-acre property in Monroe, which is about 50 miles (80km) north of New York City. She previously spent time helping abandoned pet pigs find new homes, her lawyers said. She housed any number that were unwanted and kept them as pets, they said. Gristina told friends and family members . in Scotland that she worked in internet marketing and had a sideline . gig as a real estate agent. Double life: The suburban home Gristina and Kelvin Gorr live in with their son Nicholas and their pigs and dogs in Monroe, upstate New York . Unusual pet: One of the six pot-bellied pigs Gristina keeps at her home, which houses many rescue animals . Over the years neighbours reported black chauffeur-driven limos dropping of clients at all times of the day and night. Gristina's employees reportedly included many Playboy and Penthouse models. 'There is nothing glamorous about prostitution,' Erin Duggan of the . Manhattan District Attorney’s office said in a written statement. 'Anna Gristina rented women’s . bodies for profit, which makes her a pimp. That also makes her a felon, . and the court has now issued that judgment.' Gristina's husband, Kelvin Gorr, said there was a 'sense of relief that it’s over.' 'This was in the best interest of the kids, just . to start over and move on,' he said. Not so discreet: Gristina proudly showed off pictures of her younger husband Gorr posing half naked with her on a school reunion website . To . her friends and neighbours, she was simply a homely American housewife . and mother of four, with a soft spot for animals. Pigs, in particular, . were her passion and at her suburban home outside New York she housed . any number that were unwanted and kept them as pets.

"By . Kerry Mcqueeney . When teenager Nawal Khasal came home to find a burglar stealing her family’s valuables, she instinctively knew what to do. Grabbing a cricket bat from the porch, she knocked him for six. The blow floored Derek Perry, 47, who fled the property with blood pouring from his mouth. But gutsy Miss Khasal was determined not to let the thief get away and chased him into a nearby cul-de-sac. 'Gut reaction': Nawal Khasa uses a plank of wood to re-enact the moment she hit burglar Derek Perry . Despite being repeatedly punched by 6ft Perry, Miss Khasal managed to hang on to him until police arrived. Afterwards, Perry tried to claim Miss . Khasal should be arrested for assaulting him. But officers disagreed and . no action was taken against her. Yesterday a judge praised Miss . Khasal’s actions as he jailed Perry, who has 17 previous convictions . dating back to when he was 13, for five years. Judge Mark Brown, sitting at Liverpool . Crown Court, said: ‘A householder is justifiably entitled to use . reasonable and proportionate force to defend themselves and their . property. ‘It’s clear that this is all Miss . Khasal was trying to do. She acted with tremendous courage and . determination. She is only 17 and is a great credit to people of her . age.’ 'Not fair play': Derek Perry (right) said his victim should have been arrested for assault while Judge Mark Brown (left) has praised the teenager for her bravery . He ordered Miss Khasal be awarded £250 . and a judicial commendation, adding: ‘She was faced with a man of 47, . who presents as a physically strong individual. ‘She not only stood up to him and gave as good as she received, but she then pursued him and tried to detain him. ‘It’s only through her actions that . this crime was detected. I’m sure the public would applaud her actions. She is entitled to the thanks and congratulations of the court and the . general public.’ Judge Brown’s comments come a . fortnight after the Government announced it was strengthening the law . allowing householders to defend their property against burglars. Hero: Nawal sprung into action when she arrived home and noticed a hole in the front door . Judge Mark Brown's comments in full: . 'There ought to be a judicial . commendation as far as Nawal Khasal is concerned. This is only intended . as a token mark of what she did but she will be awarded £250 out of the . public purse. 'She acted with tremendous courage . and determination. She was faced with a man of 47 years of age who . presents as a physically strong individual. 'She is only 17 years of age. She is a . great credit to people of her age. She not only stood up to him and . gave as good as she received but she then pursued him and tried to . detain him. 'When the police arrived she was able . to make sure they were able to arrest him. It’s only through her actions . that this crime was detected. 'I’m sure the general public would . applaud her actions on this occasion. She is entitled to the thanks and . congratulations of the court and the general public.' Under the changes, anyone who is . confronted by a burglar and has reason to fear for their, or their . family’s safety and, in the heat of the moment, uses force that later . seems ‘disproportionate’ will not be guilty of an offence. The court heard the robbery took place . on the afternoon of Sunday October 7 when Miss Khasal returned to her . Liverpool home from the shops. The trainee firefighter confronted Perry, . who had sawn a hole in the front door, on the staircase. Miss Khasal, . who lives with her parents and three older brothers, said: ‘It was just a . straight up, gut reaction. ‘I’d been out to the supermarket with . my mum, we’d only been gone about 25 minutes but in that time he’d . managed to saw a panel out of the front door and get into the house. ‘I saw him coming down the stairs with . bags full of our stuff – he had the Xbox, a DVD player, CDs, mainly . electrical things. 'I shouted at him and he punched me in the shoulder, . so I hit him with the cricket bat. ‘It knocked him to the ground and the bat broke in half, so I know I hit him quite hard. ‘I had hold of him and he was punching and trying to fight free, but I managed to hold on to him until the police arrived. ‘It was scary because I didn’t know if . there were any more of them in the house, but I suppose the adrenaline . just kicked in. I just did it instinctively.’","Nawal Khasal caught alcoholic Derek Perry in the act stealing goods from her family home .

"By . Travelmail Reporter . It hasn't all been plain sailing for a couple . who set off on a yacht to travel the world with their three-year-old, after they confessed she had turned into a 'hell child' on board. Kim and Simon Brown gave up their jobs and home to begin a three-year tour of the world on a 56ft boat with their daughter Sienna. But . Kim has admitted the youngster has taken badly to life on the ocean . wave with constant tantrums and crying during the first three months. Setting sail: Kim Brown considered turning back from the three-year family adventure after her daughter Sienna turned into a 'hell child' The . 39 year-old wrote on her blog: 'With so many things on my mind, I . didn't think about whether or not my daughter Sienna would be able to . cope with the massive change of lifestyle. 'I . didn't think that the lack of routine, unpredictability of sailing and . inability to have control over daily events would cause behaviour . issues. 'I also failed to consider how she'd take to playing alone. 'Up . until living on a boat, my daughter always had many friends to play . with in addition to having grandad next door. She was never alone and . never had to play by herself.' Young adventurer: Kim admitted that some criticised her decision to take Sienna to sea while she is so young - and said there had been temper tantrums . Kim and husband Simon, 47, gave up . their jobs last year and sold their six-bedroom home in Aylesbury, . Buckinghamshire to fund their quest. Simon had taught PE in a prison and Kim ran currency exchange and property businesses. Kim had previously admitted she felt there was an air of condemnation about their decision to take their daughter to sea, with some people worrying about health and safety and potential medical problems. They . set off from Gibraltar in March on the first leg of their odyssey . aboard 'Britican' and will begin by travelling the Mediterranean. In November they plan to make the 3,000-mile crossing over the Atlantic to the Caribbean. They plan to educate Sienna on their travels and say their boat will be well stocked with medical supplies in case of emergency. But . Sienna's behaviour left them considering a return to the UK until they . found help in the form of a book on parenting which they have . downloaded. Family at sea: Simon was a PE teacher for under 21s at Aylesbury Prison before giving up his job to make his dreams of a round-the-world adventure come true . Kim, . who grew up New York State, said: 'By month three into our travels and . after peeing on the floor, spitting, punching me, kicking me, biting my . arms (drawing blood) and smashing a plate I was at my wits' end. 'After discussing things with my cousin, we decided that the best word for her behaviour was 'defiant.' 'Every day we'd have more blow-outs, more tantrums and more tears - and Sienna wasn't the only one crying. 'I spent several days up on deck crying while Sienna was down below screaming her lungs out.' The couple tried taking away the toddler's toys and even her favourite blanket - but her behaviour continued to get worse. Kim . said: 'I couldn't help but think I must be a terrible parent. I thought . perhaps I'm not consistent enough, maybe I'm too soft or perhaps too . hard? 'Maybe I'm not applying punishments appropriately. Then I thought it's not just me it's the situation we are in. 'At . first, and in dramatic fashion, I thought that life on the sea wasn't . going to work for Sienna. She just wasn't handling the transition. 'I . felt ""woe is me,"" and wanted to cry out that my life is finally a dream . come true EXCEPT for the fact that my daughter has turned into a hell . child.' Sea legs: Sienna Brown's behaviour has improved since Kim found a parenting book online which gave useful advice . Kim said the parental advice book had helped calm things on board. She added: 'After reading only a few chapters I immediately perceived the whole situation in a different light and went about changing my behaviour. 'Thankfully since that major bust-up that ended with my arm bleeding and a smashed plate we haven't had another explosion. 'Yes we've had crying and upsets but we haven't had any kicking, punching, biting, spitting or weeing again.' The . family are currently sailing through the islands of Greece and their . progress can be tracked on a website regularly updated by Kim. Kim added: 'This journey is also about gaining a deeper connection to my family and learning how to be the best mom I can be.' On board: Simon and Kim set sail from Gibraltar and are currently exploring the Greek islands before crossing the Atlantic later this year .","Kim and Simon Brown are aiming to spend three years sailing the world .

"By . John Stevens . For centuries Cambridge students have worn their distinctive . graduation robes to receive their degrees from the ancient university. But . now the sight of graduates in their academic dress could be a little . different after it rewrote its traditional dress code to avoid upsetting . transgender students. From October, male students will be allowed . to wear skirts to pick up their degree certificates while female . students will be able to choose to wear men’s suits and white bow ties. Cambridge graduation day: Students have traditionally worn graduation robes over dark suits with a white shirt and white bow tie for men, and demure black dresses , suits or skirts with white shirts for women . Under . the old rules, men had to wear dark suits with a white shirt, white bow . tie and academic bands with black shoes and dark socks when they . attended graduation. Women could either wear a black dress , suit . or skirt with a white shirt and smart shoes. They were also asked to . cover their legs and arms. The dress codes were strictly enforced and students who broke the rules could be refused graduation. But the centuries old rules based on gender will be dropped when the new academic year starts in October. Students . will still be required to dress smartly for their graduations, but they . will have the freedom to choose what clothes they wear underneath their . academic gowns and hoods. The reforms have been introduced after a campaign by the student union’s Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender group. The . group said that the requirement for graduates to dress in the clothes . traditionally associated with their sex was ‘distressing’ for some . students. Charlie Bell, President of the Cambridge University . Student Union LGBT+ group, said: ‘After a number of discussions at CUSU . LGBT+, we decided it was time to act to ask the university to remove the . gendered nature of their advice for graduation dress. ‘This has . now been done through the Council, and I am delighted at how easy it has . been, and how helpful the university has been throughout. ‘It’s a . pleasure, at times like this, to belong to a university which not only . talks the talk about equalities, but walks the walk too. I hope the . colleges follow suit and that the gender label for graduation becomes . truly something of the past.’ Students at Trinity College's graduation picnic: Students will have to dress smartly for graduation, but they will have the freedom to choose what clothes they wear underneath their academic gowns and hoods . Mr Bell, 24, who is a medicine . graduate from Queen’s College, added: ‘This was an issue that many . students had talked to us about over the years. ‘From now on, . trans students shouldn’t have to go through the sometimes distressing . rigmarole of persuading their praelector (the college fellow who . presents students during their graduation ceremony) that they can wear . the outfit they feel more comfortable with. ‘It’s good to see the . university receptive to helping us make changes to tradition when . tradition no longer fits reality. But like in any city, or university, . many hearts and minds still have to be changed before gender and . sexuality stops being an issue, and just is.’ A Cambridge . University spokesman said: ‘These amendments, proposed on the . recommendation of CUSU LGBT+ and after consultation with the . Senate-House Syndicate and the Praelectors of the Colleges, replace a . reference to male dress with a gender-neutral description.’ Cambridge University holds its graduation ceremonies in the Senate House, built in 1730. Mortarboards, often associated with graduation ceremonies, are optional and most students choose not to wear one. Oxford University introduced similar rules allowing male students to wear dresses last year.","Male students will be allowed to wear skirts, while females will be allowed to choose to wear the classic men's dress code of suits and white bow ties .

"By . Tara Brady . Brunei is to become the first East Asian country to adopt Sharia law despite international criticism. Sharia punishments will include severing of limbs for theft and death by stoning for adulterers andwill be introduced over a period of three years. The tiny state on the island of Borneo is ruled by Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah and relies on oil and gasexports for its prosperity. Strict laws: The move was announced by Brunei's Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah and will come into effect from tomorrow . Almost three-quarters of those who live in Brunei are Malay Muslims but there are also Buddhist andChristian communities. The move was announced by the 67-year-old sultan. He said: 'Today I place my faith in and am grateful to Allah the almighty to announce that tomorrow,Thursday, May 1 2014, will see the enforcement of Sharia law phase one, to be followed by the otherphases.' From tomorrow people will face conviction by Islamic courts and fines or jail terms for offences like  pregnancy outside marriage, failure to perform Friday prayers and propagating other religions. A second phase comes into effect 12 months later covering offences for theft and alcohol consumption by Muslims, punishable by whipping and amputations. Almost three-quarters of those who live in Brunei are Malay Muslims but there are also Buddhist and Christian communities . The death penalty, including by stoning, will be introduced in the final phase a year later for offences including adultery, sodomy and insulting the Koran or the Prophet Muhammad. Most of the laws will also apply to non-Muslims. That raises concern among Western workers in the oil sector and tens of thousands of ethnic Chinese Bruneians and 30,000 mostly Roman Catholic Filipino migrant workers. About 20 per cent of residents are non-Muslim, including substantial Buddhist and Christiancommunities. The United Nations Commission on Human Rights denounced the new system for applying the death penalty to a wide range of offences. Several of the penalties constitute torture under international law, said Emerlynne Gil, SoutheastAsia legal adviser for the International Commission of Jurists. U.S. television personality Ellen DeGeneres (right) and British actor Stephen Fry (left) have said they will boycott the hotel chain owned by the sultan . 'A lot of these provisions and penalties discriminate against women. Stoning to death normally has ahuge impact on women because more often than not they are found guilty of these crimes.' This week celebrities, including U.S. television personality Ellen DeGeneres and British actor Stephen Fry, announced will be boycotting the hotel chain owned by the sultan on grounds thatthe new laws criminalised homosexuality. The Dorchester Collection of hotels is owned by the Sultan of Brunei. American shoe designer Brian Atwood and . fashion designer Peter Som are mobilising the fashion industry to . boycott The Beverly Hills Hotel and Hotel Bel-Air in Los Angeles which . are the only U.S. hotels that are part of The Dorchester Collection. Gay rights organisations in the Asia Pacific have condemned the move to Sharia law. 'It may open the floodgates for further human rights violations against women, children, and other people on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity,' two such groups wrote in the Malaysian Insider. 'Penalty by death sentence contravenes several international human rights laws. Luxury retreat: Coworth Park is owned by The Dorchester Collection, along with two London hotels . 'Further, death by stoning constitutes torture or other cruel, degrading and inhumane acts of punishment, thus a clear infringement of international humanitarian principles and universal human rights.' A Christian priest in Brunei said he was concerned by the development, but hoped the new system would be enforced less strictly than set down in the written law. 'They have been giving seminars to different groups to clarify,' said the priest, who declined to beidentified. Authorities, he said 'seem genuinely concerned' at suggestions that the system would have an all-pervasive enforcement network. Brunei's top Islamic scholar denied any suggestion the system would lead to extremes, persecution or cruelty. 'It is not indiscriminate cutting or stoning or caning', Awang Abdul Aziz was quoted as saying by statemedia after the law was announced. 'There are conditions and there are methods that are just and fair.' Tweeting his opinion: Stephen Fry told his followers he had cancelled his trip . Brunei officials have said there will be a high burden of proof required to sentence suspects toharsher punishments. They say criminal cases rose by a third between 2000 and 2008. Arrests for drug abuse surged 50 per cent last year from 2012. Diplomats say it remains unclear how the new system will work in practice and operate alongside thepolice and courts under the existing British-based legal system. The religious turn taken by the sultan contrasts with a reputation for decadent excess gained by the royal family. Pop idol Michael Jackson was paid a reported $17 million to give a concert in Brunei in 1996 tomark the sultan's 50th birthday. Details of the lavish lifestyle of the sultan's brother, former finance minister Prince Jefri, including owning hundreds of luxury cars and a large yacht - became public during a family legal feud. Fashion favourite: Designers are boycotting the LA hotel that is also owned by The Dorchester Collection . Critics say the new penal code will give authorities expanded powers to stifle dissent at a time whenpalace officials are concerned about dwindling energy reserves. 'A common concern among the palace elite is that the gas is going to run out. The population's loyalty has been bought with gas money,' said Maung Zarni, a visiting fellow at the London School of Economics who quit the Darussalam Brunei University in 2013 over what he said was a lack of academic freedom. Responding to a rare outbreak of dissent on social media, the sultan warned in February that anyone criticising the new laws could be punished under their provisions. Leaders of Malaysia's Islamist PAS party, part of the opposition, say the move has accelerated theirbid to install sharia punishments in Kelantan state, which they control. In Indonesia, some districts have sharia-inspired by-laws but Aceh is the only province allowed toimplement it as law. The province has its own sharia police force and courts that enforce strict laws against gambling,promiscuity and alcohol.","The tiny state on the island of Borneo is ruled by Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Six out of ten Brits regularly wake up in a bad mood, research revealed yesterday. A study found that on average, at least two mornings a week are blighted by black moods. That equates to 6,292 strops over the course of a lifetime. Factors: The biggest cause for grumpiness is a bad night's sleep, followed by a heavy workload to face when we get to the office . The biggest cause for grumpiness is a bad night's sleep, followed by a heavy workload to face when we get to the office. One in ten admitted they were 'shattered' when they woke up, while another 10 per cent said work issues made them stroppy in the mornings. One in four of those polled by Triton Showers said they automatically woke up in a grumpy mood, often for no reason. Triton spokesman Tina Simpson said: 'Waking up in a foul mood is something we can all relate to, but over 6,000 mornings of our lives ruined by a shocking mood does sound rather high. 'Many families will be able to relate to all the grumbles that are in this list, such as queuing to get in the bathroom, having no milk for a hot drink and waking up to bad weather. 'However it’s interesting to see that, . rather than breakfast, a refreshing shower, hot drink and spell of good . weather are the top three things we need to lift our mood and sets us up . for the day ahead.' But it's not all doom and gloom, with nearly half of the 2,000 adults polled saying their first tea or coffee of the day makes them feel automatically better. Water wake up: A hot shower lifts a third of people from their misery . A hot shower also lifts a third of us from our dark mood, but  21 per cent say a colder, refreshing shower is more likely to do the trick. Other grumbles which are likely to worsen our mood before we leave the house are quarrelling with family members or someone taking too long in the shower. Seeing bad weather when opening the curtains, stubbing toes and having no milk for a morning cuppa are other contributory factors. Of those polled 44 per cent said they had a strict morning routine they stick to and if they had to forgo their morning shower or coffee 49 per cent said it would ruin their day. Other morning mishaps that are likely to put Brits in a bad mood were the car not starting and missing the bus or train. Of . the 2,000 adults polled 14 per cent said bathroom politics was a . problem in their household and 16 per cent said there was always a race . to the bathroom. Nearly half of those surveyed said they took their bad mood out on their partner, although one in four said their kids bore the brunt of it. A brave one in ten said they always took out their bad mood on their boss. But the black mood doesn’t last long with most people saying their frostiness had thawed by 8.15am. Three in ten said a bright sunny morning automatically lifted their spirits. And surprisingly 26 per cent of people said their mood improved once they got to work.","Brits have more than 6,000 grumpy mornings in a lifetime .

"By . Snejana Farberov . One of three suspects accused in the murder of an Aspen socialite has been cleared of all criminal charges in light of new evidence. The 9th Judicial District Attorney’s Office on Tuesday dropped first-degree murder, conspiracy to commit murder and accessory after the fact to murder charges against 62-year-old Nancy Styler. According to a press release put out by District Attorney Sherry Caloia, the decision to clear Styler in the murder case came after her office was presented last week with new evidence, but she did not elaborate in the statement on the nature of this evidence. Cleared: Nancy Styler, 62 (left) was released from jail Tuesday after being cleared of all criminal charges in the February murder of Aspen socialite Nancy Pfister, 57 (right), who died from blunt force trauma to the head . Styler, her husband, William Styler, 66, and Katherine Carpenter, 56, have been arrested in connection to the murder of Nancy Pfister, whose body was found in a closet at her home in February. ‘With the new information received and a lack of other evidence refuting the new information the district attorney could not prove that Ms. Styler was involved in the crimes,’ the DA said in the release to Aspen Times. Following a court hearing Tuesday evening, Mrs Styler was freed from Eagle County Jail, where she had been incarcerated without bond since her arrest in March. Her husband and Carpenter, who was the victim’s friend and bookkeeper, remained behind bars.William Styler is scheduled to appear in court for a status hearing on Friday. Nancy Styler’s attorney Garth McCarty said after the hearing that his client is happy to be exonerated, and hopes the charges being dropped helps bring some closure to the victim's family. The Stylers' arrest affidavits that were unsealed last week showed that police found nine blood spots inside the couple's Jaguar, ABC News reported. The murder weapon was discovered in a trash bag not far from Nancy and William Stylers' hotel room. Nancy Pfister, 57, was hit with a hard object that had a small, curved shape and died from a blunt force trauma to the head, according to the coroner's report released in April. She had been dead about 36 hours before her body was found on February 26. William and Nancy Styler, who had rented Pfister's Aspen home while she was in Australia, were arrested March 3 after moving out of the residence February 22. Katherine Carpenter, 56, an assistant to Pfister and a bank employee, was arrested March 14. Authorities said she called 911 to report she found Pfister's body in a closet of the home. Still behind bars: Nancy's husband William Styler III, 65 (left), and Pfister's friend Katherine Carpenter (right) remain jailed without bond on murder charges . Pfister . was the daughter of the late Betty and Art Pfister, longtime prominent . Aspen residents who co-founded the Buttermilk ski area west of town. Buttermilk Mountain has hosted the Winter X Games multiple times. Pfister's death was the first homicide case in Pitkin County in 12 years, not counting those classified as murder-suicides. Pfister wrote on Facebook on February 3 . that 'the people that were supposedly taking care of my house are not . doing what they said they would do and they're not paying rent and they . haven't paid utilities'. Over the years, Pfister had paid . Carpenter, an employee at two Alpine bank branches in Aspen, to manage . her property and to walk her dog, Gabe, who came with the $4,000-a-month . lease. On February 6, . Pfister posted on Facebook that she was looking for new tenants and that . anyone interested should contact Carpenter. Ms Pfister, pictured left with her daughter Juliana, wrote on Facebook that she was returning early from Australia as she was having trouble with tenants who were not paying the rent . She subsequently returned from Australia and, days later, was found dead by Carpenter. Juliana Pfister attended those . proceedings surrounded by friends, telling ABC News that she couldn't . believe someone would kill her fun-loving mother because of an alleged . rent dispute. 'How could someone just be so angry that they got kicked out of a house?' she said. 'There's got to be something more. It's hard to understand that.' Investigators spent weeks at Pfister's house, removing many boxes and files as evidence.","District Attorney's office dropped all charges against Nancy Styler, 62, citing new evidence in the murder case of Nancy Pfister .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Call of duty: San Marino, California, Mayor Dennis Kneier has admitted to throwing a bag filled with canine excrement onto a walkway belonging to a local resident . In political disputes mud-slinging is not uncommon, but the mayor of a small California town was forced to resign after he was caught throwing not mud, but feces into a rival’s yard. San Marino Mayor Dennis Kneier was caught on a surveillance camera on June 7, hurling a small plastic bag filled with dog excrement onto a resident's walkway. Kneier has since admitted to his foul transgression and apologized, saying he should have disposed of the animal waste properly. And on Tuesday, he resigned. 'I thought it would be the very best thing for us to move forward and . have a reorganization and have a new mayor,' he said in an interview with NBC Los Angeles. Speaking to the Whittier Daily News, the mayor said he was walking home from a local park with his wife at around 6pm on the day of the incident when they stumbled upon a bag of feces on Charlton Road. Instead of throwing it in a garbage bin, the head of the municipality picked it up and flicked it onto a pathway belonging to Philip Lao. The homeowner told NBC Los Angeles he recognized the mayor on surveillance video and called police, who responded to the home and photographed the sack of pungent evidence. Scroll down for video . Feces-flinging mayor: Mayor Kneier (pictured) was caught on a surveillance camera carrying a small sack of dog excrement he had found and then throwing it onto Philip Lao's property . Mea culpa: After police became involved in the case, the mayor issued the homeowner an apology . Lao and Kneier have been at odds over a proposed dog park in San Marino - a wealthy suburb of Los Angeles with median household income of nearly $200,000, which more than 13,000 people call home. The provenance of the bag of waste at the center of the controversy remains unknown as neither Kneier nor Lao own a dog. Mr Kneier said he delivered an apology letter cited by Pasadena Star-News to Lao, which read: ‘Dear Phil, Late in the day this past Saturday, June 7, Liz and I were returning from a walk in Lacy Park when we noticed a bag of dog waste in your west parkway near the lamp post. Rather than leave it or dispose of it properly, I placed it on your side walkway. This was a mistake, for which I apologize. It won’t happen again. Sincerely, Dennis Kneier.’ Lao turned the surveillance footage to police but declined to file charges against the mayor. Sign of trouble: Lao and Kneier have been locked in a dispute over a proposed dog park backed by the mayor, who was also upset over 'no poop zone' signs posted on his opponent's front lawn . Philip Lao suspected that Kneier flung the bag as payback for opposing his plan to create a dog park in Lacy Park near his home, saying that pets tend to get into scraps when left unattended for hours by their owners. Lao also has run afoul of the mayor by posting signs on his front lawn that read 'no poop zone.' In Kneier's resignation letter, he acknowledged that dog feces situation as the reason he was quitting. Vice Mayor Eugene Sun will now step in as acting mayor until the city council can meet and select a new mayor. 'This has been a challenging few days for our city and we're hopeful . that with Mr. Kneier's decision, and with his public and private . expressions of regret for the incident, we can move forward,' Sun said.","Dennis Kneier, mayor of San Marino, California, has admitted to tossing bag of excrement onto Philip Lao's property .

"By . Martin Robinson . 'The perfect bridge player's death': Wendy Brown died while playing a winning 29-point hand of cards . One of Britain's leading bridge players died immediately after being dealt a 'once in a lifetime' hand because she 'couldn't take the excitement'. Wendy Brown, 80, collapsed in front of friends while playing a remarkable 29-point game but even her heartbroken son admitted today: 'It was a lovely way for her to go'. The grandmother of 12 suffered heart failure at the John Betjeman Centre in Wadebridge, Cornwall, during her regular Tuesday night bridge night. Bereft friends said today they were in shock, but admitted it is the 'perfect bridge player's death'. In the panic nobody checked her cards but she may have had four aces, four kings, and a jack - almost unheard of in bridge circles. She had played the game for five decades and achieved the hallowed status of Premier Life Master, but experts said today a 29-point game is so rare it is unlikely she ever had one. Her son Charlie said: 'I can imagine the smile on her face when she looked at her cards and she knew she had a winning hand. She died doing what she loved to do. 'The other members of the bridge club responded magnificently and tried everything to revive her. 'But when all is said and done, it was a lovely way to go. Remarkable: In the chaos after the much-loved grandmother died nobody noted down her hand, but experts have speculated it probably had four aces and perhaps four kings . 'Her death was obviously a great shock and was very sudden, but looking back we are very happy she went this way. 'When I go myself I would love to think I'll go out like this, doing something I love.' The maximum points total for a bridge hand is 37, meaning she had almost three-quarters of the scoring cards in a pack. He said: 'An hour and a half in there was this cry from her partner ""get an ambulance"". 'In effect she played this remarkable hand and collapsed and died immediately afterwards. Each of the four players, split into two teams, receives 13 cards in a hand. The object of bridge is to win tricks. Each person will 'bid' for tricks, based on how many they believe their cards can help them win. They will make this 'bid' based on the number of scoring cards they have. These are as follows: . Ace: Four points . King: Three points . Queen: Two points . Jack: One point . There are 13 tricks to be won and a trick consists of four cards - one from each player. The highest card wins the trick, unless a trump card is laid. In this instance, experts have suggested that the winning hand contained a jack, four kings and four aces. 'Wendy had 29 points in her hand. I haven't seen a 29 point hand, if ever, or certainly not for a very long time. 'I can't remember seeing one with more points than that in the past 18 years or so. 'Wendy will no doubt have been extremely excited by getting such a hand. My theory is that she couldn't take the excitement. 'It's very sad but what a way to go. It's the perfect bridge player's death'. Wendy was sitting around the table with her close pal Mimi Falconar, 66, when she slumped forward in her chair. Another close friend and playing partner, Maureen Brinton rushed over to help, but by then Wendy was already dead. Mimi . said: 'She was delighted to have played that hand. She hadn't even put . her cards away when she went, it was very sudden. I knew instantly she . was gone. 'Wendy was exceptionally kind, terrific fun to play with, and she'd been playing for donkey's years. 'If . you had asked her a fortnight earlier how she would have liked to go . she would have said: at the card table. Bridge was her joy.'

"By . Scarlett Russell . Her sky-high exploits have been documented recently, with tales of champagne-fuelled parties around the world, run-ins with celebrities and mingling with Sir Richard Branson himself. But for Mandy Smith, 40, from Teesside, Hartlepool, being an air stewardess with Virgin Atlantic wasn’t just about having fun and games in Upper Class and glamorous locations. In fact, being groped, having food thrown at her and looking after a woman who’d suffered a miscarriage in the economy toilets – all the while maintaining an air of calm professionalism – were more common. Scroll down for video . Party hard: 'We had fun but were always professional,' says Mandy, pictured here in her cabin crew days . Cabin Fever: The Sizzling Secrets of a . Virgin Air Hostess published last month, is Mandy’s memoir of her . 10-year stint as a Virgin ‘Trolley Dolly.’ And she doesn’t hold back about the on and off-board antics. Speaking . to MailOnline, Mandy elaborates on some of the best anecdotes from her . book, as well as sharing some scandalous tales that didn’t quite make . the final cut. ‘Obviously we . had a lot of fun times but I did leave a lot out because I didn’t want . it to seem like that was all we did,’ she says. ‘The Virgin crew are professional and diligent and I wanted to make sure that came across.’ A quieter life: Mandy says she wouldn't swap her Virgin days for anything, but is now happily married with a daughter . And you can forget the Mile High Club, according to Mandy it was the passengers who are the worst behaved mid-air. ‘The book charts 10 years and in that time I knew of only two instances where cabin crew messed about – one stewardess on my flight was caught giving oral sex to a famous boyband member but she was sacked on the spot, they take that very seriously. ‘The passengers behaved far worse, especially in Premium Economy because they think they’re better than Economy, but actually can’t afford Upper. Flying high: Mandy worked as an air stewardess at Virgin for 10 years . ‘I had a man throw pizza in my face once because he said it wasn’t good enough for his son to eat. ‘And one businessman was travelling in Upper Class and getting it on at the bar with a fellow female passenger. They’d had a few drinks and had a few snogs. Literally five minutes later his wife walked through to see him. She’d been sitting back in Economy with no idea what was going on! We were shocked.’ And the mother of a very famous American star, travelling without her son, head-butted one of Mandy’s colleagues, causing her nose to bleed. ‘She boarded and threw her fur coat at me, ordering me to store it away,’ remembers Mandy. ‘I knew then that she’d be trouble. ‘It’s also public knowledge that she and . her son don’t get on very well. She had a few drinks throughout the . flight and took sleeping pills, then all of a sudden went crazy and had . to be wrestled to the ground. ‘She head-butted my colleague who was . merely trying to restrain her outburst, and her nose burst open and I . don’t even think she ever apologised. We have to put up with a lot!’ In the book Mandy also describes having to sew up a man whose five stitches in his stomach had burst open, and the trauma of finding a passenger in the plane's toilet, who had just suffered a miscarriage. 'I gathered plastic aprons, surgical gloves, face masks and cloths from our first-aid supplies in the galley and returned to the scene with more crew to help,' says Mandy. 'We have to be calm and helpful in all situations, nothing can faze us. No matter how upsetting, we are there to help.' And it's not just unruly and amorous passengers that make it a difficult job –frequent flying and conflicting time zones take their toll. Constant wind, IBS and even missing periods are just par for the course. Famous friends: During her hey day as as member of Virgin Atlantic's Cabin Crew, Mandy Smith, right, partied all around the world and even met Ronan Keating, left, after a gig . He's the boss! Sir Richard Branson, left, was 'amazing' to work for, says Mandy, right, who was an air stewardess for ten years with the Virgin mogul . ‘Going up and down so often plays havoc with the gases released in your body and the different time zones and poor diet really mess you up too,’ says Mandy. ‘Most crew members have IBS and I didn’t have a period for seven months because my body clock was so all over the place. ‘And anyone who thinks stewardesses are sexy should know that it’s not stockings and suspenders we wear under our uniform – it’s support tights and girdles to prevent varicose veins!’ On the plus, travelling first class and having exotic holidays isn’t too shabby. Even when Mandy wasn't working she'd be upgraded on every flight and even took her mum on a seven-day shopping spree in Cape Town. And week-long stop overs meant lots of partying. Mandy says: ‘We once had a week in St Lucia, staying in a top hotel for free. There was a group of us and it was one big party. Cabin Fever: The sizzling secrets of a Virgin air hostess by Mandy Smith and Nicola Stow, £9.99, is available now . ‘After a few drinks in our rooms we all . went skinny dipping in the sea, but someone ran off with our clothes. 'Not only did we have to head back through the hotel completely naked, . but one girl lost a bet so had to swim in every pool of the hotel, . naked, before she was allowed back. 'It was like an office Christmas party, but lasting several nights every month.’ Mandy’s most raucous party was a stag do in the city of sin itself, Las Vegas, which she said was ‘too raucous’ to leave in the book. ‘The boyfriend of one of the crew members was on the stag do of a Calvin Klein model,’ she says. ‘They invited a few of us girls along. No expense was spared, he’d hired huge private marquees outside one of the biggest nightclubs in the city with drinks flowing. ‘Afterwards we all went back to their hotel suite which was massive. People were getting it on all over the place and drugs were lined up on the tables, though of course we didn’t touch them because Virgin do random drug tests. ‘We certainly took advantage of all the free champagne though!’ And Mandy recalls meeting Ronan Keating at a party Sir . Richard threw for their inaugural flight to Toronto. 'It was a lavish white . marquee on tip of the bay with a B747-400 fly over,' she says. 'There were huge cocktails, Ronan sang Richard even joined in . with the backing dancers for a rendition of Raining Men when The Weather Girls performed! 'They all stripped . off to Union Jack shorts for the finale. Ronan was such a genuinely . lovely man. Unfortunately no one in Canada knew who he was but all the . crew ran to the stage & were singing along with all his songs. Just another normal night out with the crew!' Now, Mandy lives a quiet life with her husband, Glenn, 40 and daughter who is two years old. in West Sussex, but says she wouldn’t swap her colourful life with Virgin Atlantic for anything. ‘I made amazing friends and went all over the world,’ she says.

"By . Sam Webb . Among the police pounding London's streets include a druid, four mediums - who believe the living can talk with the dead - and two pagans. A Freedom of Information request into various 'non mainstream' religions practised by the the 31,000 bobbies working for the Met Police uncovered the details last week. Bosses at the Met confirmed that they had one officer who was a druid. According to the Romans, Druids practised human sacrifice 2,000 years ago, but modern day druidism - called neo-Druidism - focuses on the worship of nature, especially trees. Worship: Recently-released figures show there are Spiritualists, Pagans and a Druid (not pictured) practising their faith in the Metropolitan Police Force. File pictures . They also confirmed there were four officers who practised Spiritualism, which focuses on the belief that the living can communicate with the spirits of people who have died. Spiritualists and mediums believe that there is life after death and that by holding seances, the dead can talk to the living, either through direct communication or the Ouija board. Two officers list themselves as being Pagans, which worship a string of gods and festivals according to archaic religions which pre-date Christianity. The list found that no officers were Devil worshippers - also known as Occultists - and no followers of Hare Krishna. Faith in police: Officers who are pagans could claim time off work to visit Stonehenge in Wiltshire under new EU laws . According to new European laws, employers will soon have to bow down to followers of 'non mainstream' religions and give them days off according to their religion's calendar. The Equality and Human Rights Commission stated last week that human rights of people with 'profound personal beliefs' must be protected and that 'employees may assert the right to discuss their beliefs in the workplace and employers should not prevent such conversations'. Druids, vegans and green activists should be given special treatment at work, according to ‘lunatic’ advice from the equalities watchdog. The commission  warns employers that they risk ‘potentially costly legal action’ unless they allow staff to follow their ‘religion or belief rights’ in the workplace. Druids should have the same rights at work as mainstream religious staff, according to the new guidelines . This could include giving believers time off to go on pilgrimages, such as druids and pagans going to Stonehenge, while environmentalists should be free to lecture other staff about their car use. EHRC chief executive Mark Hammond said: 'The right of people to express their religious belief is a vital freedom.' But Dominic Raab, a Tory MP and former international lawyer, blasted the new rules. He said: ‘This is a recipe for every crank and crazy to take their boss for a ride. The EHRC has become an expensive taxpayer-funded laughing stock.’","Figures on 'non-mainstream' religious beliefs of officers released .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A New York lawyer who has admitted to brutally killing his girlfriend in 2012 will argue this week that he strangled the woman because he was traumatized as a child by his mother. Jason Bohn, 35, has been charged with murder over the beating and strangling of 27-year-old Danielle Thomas in their Astoria, New York apartment June 25, 2012. The Columbia University-educated lawyer, whose trial got under way late last month, will rely on testimony of Los Angeles-based forensic psychiatrist Alexander Sasha Bardey, who is known in Hollywood circles as a consultant on the TV drama 'Law and Order: Special Victims Unit.' Courtroom strategy: The defense will claim that Jason Bohn (left), who has been charged with strangling his girlfriend Danielle Thomas (right), was traumatized as a child and 'blew up' during his confrontation with the victim . The expert will attempt to convince a . Queens jury that Bohn was suffering from 'Intermittent Explosive . Disorder' and did not know what he was doing when he stomped on and . throttled Thomas, an analyst at Weight Watchers. The . prominent psychiatrist will also cast some of the blame on Bohn's . mother, Maureen O'Connell, chief financial officer at Scholastic, New York Post reported.

During . opening statements January 29, prosecutors revealed that Danielle Thomas was . afraid for the life of her dog, Schnoozer, and rushed home on the night . of her murder to protect him, even though a friend had offered to take . her to a hotel. Prosecutor . Patrick O'Connor told the jury panel that Bohn had threatened to kill . the black-and-white pooch in the past, and Thomas rushed home in a bid . to save her pet. ‘It was for the love of her dog,’ the prosecutor said. ‘She was afraid for her dog.’ Captured: Bohn is brought into Queens Supreme Court in handcuffs on July 23, 2012 . Bohn's . defense attorney, Todd Greenberg regaled the jurors with his client's . rags-to-riches tale, describing the 35-year-old as a victim of childhood . trauma who was abandoned by his career-obsessed mother and . drug-addicted father, but who managed to graduate from a top school after spending his teens living in a group home. ‘How . did someone like him end up in a courtroom charged with murder in the . first degree?’ Greenberg asked jurors. ‘The answer is mental illness.’ A . message accidentally left on a friend's voicemail that allegedly . captured the last terrifying moments of Thomas' life is expected to play a . major role in the trial. On the chilling recording, a man believed to be Bohn relentlessly questions why Miss Thomas made a phone call to a number with a 508 area code. Bohn then strangles the 27-year-old before letting go as she pleads with him and tries to answer his questions, CBS was told by prosecutors. Impressive resume: The defense retained the services of Hollywood forensic psychiatrist Alexander Sasha Bardey, who is a consultant on Law & Order SVU and co-producer of the 2013 film Side Effects . She struggles to breath as she answers over and over: 'I don't know... Jason, I love you.' He then replies: 'You have five seconds and then...and then I'm going to kill you. He continues: 'I'm going to let you up and then you need to answer quickly or else you die... Danielle, why did you call that number? 'Danielle you are so stupid. You think I'm going to stop, I won't stop.' It is unclear whether the voicemail came from the victim or alleged killer's cellphone. Neighbors called police to check on her after hearing a fight and the woman's dead body was found in a bathtub full of ice. Bohn . had fled the couple's apartment in Queens with his girlfriend's phone, . which he used to assure her family she was fine. He . sent a text to one of her contacts saying: 'Please trust me,' adding . that Thomas was 'fine' and attending the weekend’s gay pride parade in . Greenwich Village. He . also used the phone to call a former flame, allegedly confessing to her . that he got drunk and unwittingly slammed Miss Thomas against a wall. 'I’m in serious trouble,' Bohn told Jasmine Nieves in a recording played in court last month. 'Please do not talk with any law enforcement officials until my defense attorneys can contact you. 'I don’t remember anything that happened, OK. I think I pushed her. She bumped her head. When I woke up the next morning she was not breathing. I freaked out and I fled the city.' Despite Bohn's pleadings, Nieves spoke to a detective who contacted her the following day and played the voicemail for him. Grim discovery: Danielle Thomas' body was found in the Queens apartment in a bath full of ice last June . Murder scene: Thomas was found murdered in a bathtub of ice at the couple's Astoria, New York home . He . was eventually tracked down to a restaurant in White Plains five days . after the killing and charged with murder - which was later upgraded to . first degree - and evidence tampering. After he was jailed, Bohn dictated to his brother a self-pitying rant to be posted on Facebook blaming . his girlfriend for the killing. He blamed Thomas, stress, alcohol and his own abuse at the hands of his father for the murder - refusing to take responsibility for his murderous actions. 'I suspected she was a cheater,' he wrote. 'At the . very least, I gradually confirmed she was a compulsive liar, . particularly with regard to relations with the opposite sex, both past . and present. 'As a result I grew insecure and . abusive. In hines-sight [sic] one of us should've walked away. But, I was already . madly in love with her. 'I was also extremely mad (both meanings).' He described the night he killed her, claiming he got drunk and snapped but 'in all honesty, it was an accident,' he wrote. 'I woke up the next morning in complete shock. 'My knuckles were bruised badly and she was on the floor unconscious,' he added on his Facebook page. Police records show that Bohn has a . history of abuse and had repeatedly threatened Thomas before her . death, saying he would hunt her down 'like a dog in the streets'. When . officers discovered Thomas, they found two handwritten notes in the . couple’s apartment, believed to have been written by . Bohn. The first note . said: ‘It was an accident…I had been drinking and I was drunk when I got . home. She was already asleep. I woke up and there was fighting between . us. When I woke up again she was unconscious…I am sorry.' Brutal death: Miss Thomas had moved from Florida to New York to be with her boyfriend. He now stands accused of her murder . Loss: Bohn blamed Miss Thomas' lying, stress, alcohol and his own abusive past for the murder; in court, the prosecution said the 27-year-old rushed home to protect her dog, Schnoozer (right), from Bohn . The second note, according to Queens District Attorney Richard Brown, read: ‘Dani, I will love you forever.’ In the Facebook post, he maintains he loves and misses her, and described his bleak existence. 'I . alternate between crying uncontrollably in my cell while I stare at her office . building from my window to fighting with other inmates over food,' he wrote. In a further show of self pity, Bohn added he had struggled with abuse and abandonment. He and his brother lived in a Florida trailer park with . their father, who put beer in their bottles when they were babies, and . turned Jason to cocaine, Chris Bohn, 30, told the Post. Thomas was a senior analyst at Weight Watchers and had recently moved from Florida to New York to be with her boyfriend. Neighbors recalled hearing her screams for help the evening she was killed. Missed: Bohn, right, had been violent in the past and Miss Thomas (pictured left with a relative) had a protection order against him . 'She’s screaming; she’s calling for help: ""He’s kill me. Somebody help me,""' recalled the building's superintendent to CBS. Other tenants said they heard the . tumultuous and violent couple's brawls since they moved in. Thomas had even filed for an order of protection against Bohn. In a criminal complaint obtained by . the MailOnline last year, a police officer described numerous bruises on her face . and back and threatening emails she suffered. She reported the . assault on June 7, 2012 and Bohn called her while she . was speaking with officers. 'It's war, I'll dedicate my life to . hunting you down like a dog in the streets, I am going to make your life . impossible,' he said, according to the report. She went into hiding after getting . her order of protection, staying at a battered women's shelter named . Safe Horizon for two weeks. It is unclear why she returned to the . apartment, but she was found bludgeoned after a friend called . investigators asking for them to check on her. An autopsy report by the medical examiner revealed that Ms Thomas died of neck compression and blunt-force trauma.","Jason Bohn, 35, charged with first-degree murder of Danielle Thomas .

"By . Steve Robson . 'Bully': John Yates has been jailed for life with a minimum term of 18 years for the murder of his wife Barbara . A 'possessive and violent' bully who killed his estranged wife then drove her body in the boot of his car to a police station will serve at least 18 years in jail. John Yates, 58, who had been found guilty of murder, was told by a judge at Caernarfon crown court in North Wales that he had done everything in his power to prevent his wife Barbara from leading her own life. Following the murder somewhere in the Warrington area he drove her body in the boot of his Peugeot 306 estate to a police traffic base 45 miles away at St Asaph where he handed himself in. Speaking outside court today, Barbara's older sister Angela Hyland, of Glossop, . Derbyshire, said: 'I hope he dies in prison. He was very possessive, . selfish, controlling and jealous. 'If he couldn’t have her he wouldn’t . let anyone else have Barbara. She was living a life of fear.' Judge Merfyn Hughes QC said Yates had subjected her to a 'brutal and sustained' attack last July. A pathologist suggested there were numerous blows to the head with a weapon. Mrs Yates, 49, a mother-of-two and his wife and partner for more than 30 years, was also strangled. They met when she was 18 in a Manchester club. She was a taxi escort for disabled children. But Yates had been violent and abusive towards her their entire relationship, the court heard yesterday. Victim: Barbara Yates had been with John since the age of 18 after meeting him in a Manchester club . Brutal attack: A judge at Caernarfon Crown Court said John Yates had been 'possessive' and 'violent' towards his wife 'from the outset' Wyn Lloyd Jones, prosecuting, said Mrs Yates had told her sister that her husband had once locked her in a cupboard. In 1987, she was admitted to hospital after he allegedly punched her repeatedly, tried to strangle her and banged her head on a car dashboard. But in 2009, Mrs Yates decided she couldn't take anymore and finally left her abusive husband. But he was jealous of her new life. In 2011 she was taken to hospital after a 'prolonged assault' by him. At one stage he allegedly got a hammer and hit her over the head. Guilty: The court heard how John Yates had behaved violenty towards his wife for 30 years . Mrs Yates, a taxi escort for disabled children, had also described how her husband went berserk after being refused sex. But she withdrew a complaint against him. Seven months later, on July 18, she was killed. Police still do not know exactly where the murder took place. Judge Hughes told him : 'From the outset you behaved in a possessive and violent manner towards her.' Eventually he hadn’t wanted to lose his home as a result of her seeking a divorce. Judge Hughes told Yates : 'Your killing of her was premeditated and had been in your mind for some weeks prior to her death.' Imposing a life sentence, the judge . told Yates, of Derby Drive, Padgate, Warrington, who once worked for a . skip hire firm, he would serve a minimum of 18 years behind bars less . time remanded in custody. Defence QC Stephen Riordan said Yates had been under stress for some time and suffered from depression. North . Wales Police welcomed the sentence. Acting Detective Chief Inspector . Iestyn Davies said 'John Yates has been convicted of a sustained attack . on his wife Barbara that has ultimately led to her death. 'Barbara Yates was subjected to domestic abuse at the hands of John Yates on many occasions and tragically found herself unable to break free from this abusive and violent relationship.'","John Yates, 58, subjected wife Barbara to 'brutal and sustained' attack .

"By . Eddie Wrenn . Children addicted to the internet could soon be classed as having a serious mental illness, it has been claimed. According to the Sun-Herald, 'internet-use disorder' will be included in the DSM-IV - the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders - from May next year. The diagnosis will include those who are addicted to their smartphones as well as using tablet computers or desktop machines. Australian experts joined the Australian Psychological . Society in submitting the classification to the international manual, and added an inclusion of internet gaming addiction. Rise of the machines: With internet access becoming cheaper and more accessible, 'internet-use disorder' will be classified as a mental illness . From next May, the internet-use disorder will be listed as as a condition 'recommended for further study'. The addiction is said to be part of the fall-out over the 'always on' mentality that has engulfed many countries over the last decade, with the prevalence of cheap access and the rise of the smartphone. Psychiatrists warn of rising numbers of children becoming addicted to games . Mike . Kyrios from Swinburne University of Technology, who helped author the APS submission, told the Sun-Herald that, once more research is invested in the disorder, it will allow . health professionals to diagnose children with addictive behaviours from . technology over-use, leading to the correct treatment. He said: 'With kids, gaming is an obvious issue. But overall, technology use could be a potential problem.' Another psychologist, Emil Hodzic, who runs a video game addiction treatment clinic in . Sydney, said he was concernedcbecause of what he saw as growing demand from frustrated . parents and damaged children. He said he was seeing clients as young as . 12 addicted to the internet and video games. ''The most typical . sign of addiction is anything that looks like withdrawal symptoms,'' he . said. 'So any expression of distress, frustration, irritability when . they don't get to play.'' He added that 70 per cent of his . clients were children and teenagers and added: 'a lot of kids I . have coming into the clinic have difficultly in being able to tolerate . distress without zoning out via the internet or via the games.' Psychiatrist Rhoshel Lenroot gave a note of caution to the newspaper, saying: 'I think [it] can be . dangerous in not learning how to pay attention in a focused way, but in . balance there is nothing wrong with technology.' Many of us struggle to go more than a few minutes without checking our email inboxes. But new research suggests ignoring messages altogether can reduce stress by having a positive effect on the heart. Scientists who attached heart rate monitors to office workers found they remained in a state of 'high alert' throughout the day if they had constant access to email. Now University of California informatics professor Gloria Mark has given her verdict on email after running an experiment in which 13 volunteers ignored their 'you've got mail' chimes for five days. She said:'We couldn't see a discernible trend on days 1 and 2. But at day 5, the pattern started to become clear: People became less stressed after being away from email. 'We used monitors that measured the heart rate and also the intervals between heartbeats to obtain a common measure for stress called heart rate variability. 'People reported that they were more productive. They said they were able to focus on tasks longer. That was borne out by the data. 'On average, people with email switched windows about 37 times per hour. Without email, that was cut in half to 18 times per hour. 'With email, they spent an average of 394 seconds on any particular window. That went up to 568 seconds without email. This may not seem a lot, but in the world of multitasking it's a huge difference. People said they felt liberated, and the euphoria lasted for a few days. They really tried very hard to make a change. But then everybody reverted back to their old ways.","'Internet-use disorder' to be logged as mental illness to disorder 'bible' DSM-IV .

Horrifying: A 15-year-old took advantage of a schoolgirl's drunken state, by offering to help her home, before brutally raping her (posed by models) A 15-year-old took advantage of a schoolgirl's drunken state, by offering to help her home, before brutally raping her. The youth, who cannot be named, left his 14-year-old victim, with extensive injuries after the attack in Washington, Tyne and Wear. Yesterday at Newcastle Crown Court the attacker, who is now 16, was sentenced to three-and-a-half years detention. The schoolgirl told police her life since the rape has been 'unbearable'. Prosecutor Penny Moreland told the court on Wednesday the victim had been 'clearly extremely drunk' when the youth volunteered to take her home. He refused offers from friends who said they would help him get her back safely. Miss Moreland told the court: 'She remembered him and another boy helping her. She then remembered opening her eyes to find the defendant having sex with her. 'The next thing she remembered after that was waking up in hospital.' The court heard the girl had to undergo intimate examinations at hospital and follow up appointments after in the attack in January 2011. Miss Moreland said: 'She had extensive genital injuries. They would have been very painful if sustained by a fully conscious person. Jailed: At Newcastle Crown Court yesterday the attacker, who is now 16, was sentenced to three-and-a-half years detention . 'The are indicative of forceful trauma to the genital area. 'This was her first sexual experience, she had not had sexual intercourse with anyone before this. 'Her first sexual experience was that of having been raped and she expects it will live with her for the rest of her life.' The court heard the girl spent almost a year thinking she was going to have to relive her ordeal from the witness box in court before her attacker pleaded guilty to rape. The teen attacker wept in the dock as he was sentenced. Judge David Wood told him: 'The victim was physically quite badly injured as a result of this and is plainly still very distressed about it. 'The effects of it are likely to be long lasting as far as she is concerned, as is plain from her victim statement.' The teen was told he must sign the sex offenders register and will be banned from working with children for life. Glen Gatland, defending, said the teenager has been 'traumatised' by his own life experiences in the past and had 'taken advantage' of his victim’s drunken state that night. Mr Gatland added: 'When he saw the state she was in he decided to try and walk her home. 'In supporting her there was close physical contact between them, he was holding her up with his arm around her waist. 'It got him physically and sexually aroused.'","The youth, left his 14-year-old victim with 'extensive genital injuries' after the attack in Washington, Tyne and Wear, last January .

"By . Katy Winter . A woman who was so overweight she had to have both knees replaced has lost over half her body weight through hypnosis. Trish Walker, 56, from Australia, was 24st 7lbs at her heaviest but has managed to drop to 12st 3lbs after conquering her fast food cravings. Following a double knee replacement that was needed as a direct result of her obesity the mother-of-two was preparing to have a gastric band fitted when her psychiatrist recommended a hypnotherapy course. In the end the course proved so successful that Trish was able to conquer her addiction to food and lose weight without the dangerous surgery. Trish walker lost over 12st, from 24st 7lbs (left) to 12st 3lbs (right) through hypnosis . Trish, who is now retired from her job as a Childhood Manager for the Department of Education, says: ‘Now I am the kind of person who enjoys moving my body'. A yo-yo dieter since her teens, Trish, who is mother to Kathryn, 24, and Ben, 25, had gained and lost up to 8st at a time over the years. Trish would often eat whole cakes in secret, or entire packs of biscuits and tubs of ice-cream alone in her car, sometimes eating until she was physically sick. Her knees had become so destroyed by her size that the bones were rubbing together and she was barely able to walk. Trish has yo yo dieted all her life, but always regained the weight, often eating in secret . Trish had often contemplated a gastric band but her sister-in-law had died years before from complications when having one fitted, leaving Trish terrified of undergoing the procedure. Despite her fears, her increasing disability and desperation at her inability to lose weight prompted Trish to start seeing a psychiatrist to discuss getting a gastric band fitted. The psychiatrist recommended Trish also started seeing a hypnotherapist, who had had success with food addicts. Trish during her incredible weight loss, at 22st (left) and 14st (right) Hypnotherapist Maggie Wilde worked with Trish to retrain her thought patterns around food, using a CPR (control, program, rewire) method, which involves tapping on control points on the body while repeating mantras to retrain the mind. Trigger points including the sternum, the chin, the underside of the hand, and fingers, and are repeatedly tapped gently to beat cravings. Trish says: 'I was amazed how well it worked. In the first session I could remember thinking while we were doing the tapping that there was no way I wouldn’t have my cake that weekend. Now at a trim 12st 3lb, Trish says she feels amazing and now visits the gym at least 5 times a week . 'But after the session I went to the local café where I’d always go, and I looked at the cake display, and I found I just didn’t want one. ‘I still get cravings and have had to really tap into the resistance, because it is still a choice.' Trish also used the hypnosis tapping to help rid herself of her fear of exercise. Trish in her old 'fat dress' in April this year as the effects of her weight loss began to show . Previously almost immobile, Trish now exercises daily and goes to water aerobics and the gym at least 5 times per week. ‘I started with just moving around the living room, just moving my body. ‘It happened slowly, I’d start parking the car further away from where I needed to be, and just focus on moving more. ‘Now I go to the gym 5 to 6 times a week, including swimming and aqua aerobics . ‘If someone had said to me 18 months ago that I would even be in a gym outfit I would have thought they were mad, but I love it.’ Maggie, who has written a book on her methods ‘Mind Potential: Unzip the Fat Suit Using Your Mind’ says: ‘‘I taught Trish how to control cravings so she could say no to the addictive sugars and carbs. 'It's never just about the weight though, there's always differing levels of self doubt, self blame, self anger and old emotional issues that cause us to eat our emotions. ‘We rewired her thinking and emotional patterns so that she learned how to deal with challenges in healthy ways. ‘Now she eats only to provide nutrition for her body. She loves who she has become and so do her family.  She has actually learned to like herself for the first time in her life. The strategies taught her to think like a slim and healthy person. Trish now weighs a healthy 12st 3lbs she has lost about 170Ibs, half her original body weight. ‘It’s amazing. I feel the healthiest, and even the most beautiful that I’ve ever been,’ she says.","Trish Walker was 24st 7lbs at her heaviest .

"By . Ryan Gorman . A Saturday morning JetBlue flight from New York to Las Vegas was diverted to Detroit after a belligerent passenger lunged at a flight attendant in front of his horrified family. The unidentified male is shown in a passenger video shouting at the crew member as his children plead with him to stop and another person can be seen trying to hold him down. He was yelling in a foreign language and did not speak English, a passenger told WABC, so no one had any idea what he was upset about. Scroll down for video . Out of control: This man shouted at a flight attendant before lunging at him as his children begged him to stop . The 6.40 a.m. flight from John F. Kennedy International Airport was in the air for about an hour when the disruption occurred, according to a passenger who gave the footage to the network. He appeared to be in a heated argument with his family before others aboard the sleepy plane became involved. The man only became more irate, and was banging on seats while gesturing at a flight crew member trying to calm him down. But the effort had the opposite effect, and the man lunged at the flight attendant as his children shouted in horror. ‘Dad, dad, stop it,’ they begged. Cuffed and taken away: The man was then moved to the back of the plane before being taken to a Detroit-area hospital by police . Their father was instead handcuffed by the flight crew and led away. The irate passenger attempted to wriggle free as he was pushed down the aisle by three attendants the back of the plane. The captain then made the snap decision to offload the man in Detroit, where he was taken to a local hospital for evaluation. ‘Due to a customer issue, the captain elected to divert to Detroit this morning in an abundance of caution,’ the airline said in a statement. There were no further incidents, and the flight resumed after a few hours. The passenger remains in police custody. It is not clear what charges he may face. Also not clear is whether drugs or alcohol played a role.","The flight left John F Kennedy International Airport at 6.40 a.m.

"By . Scarlett Russell . A child born with an ultra-rare genetic condition which has left her unable to speak only received the correct diagnosis after her mum researched her symptoms on the internet. Melissa Adams, 10, from Eccleston in Lancashire, was born with Angelman syndrome, a genetic disorder which affects just one in 25,000 people. But the youngster was only diagnosed at the age of three after her mother, Kathryn, spent years battling with doctors who insisted there was nothing wrong. Mother knows best: Melissa Adams, 10, left, has an ultra-rare genetic condition, Angleman syndrome, which renders her unable to speak. She was tested at two years old and finally diagnosed a year later . Pretty in pink: Melissa Adams, 10, pictured here, is a 'very happy girl and she has this excessive laughter which . gets us all going,' says her mother . Kathryn, 48, knew there was something wrong when when Melissa was just 12 months old. She tells Mail Online: 'Melissa was crying all the time. She couldn't lie on her tummy, wasn't sitting up and wasn't making any of the babbling noises babies normally make. 'Her head was very flat at the back too and she wouldn't feed or interact with anybody. 'She'd cling to me like a baby monkey. I knew something wasn't right.' Kathryn said she took her daughter to the doctors dozens of times but was always told there was nothing wrong and that she would eventually 'catch up.' Melissa, left, wasn't diagnosed with Angelman syndrome until she was three years old. The previous year her mother Kathryn, with Melissa right, insisted she was tested . Smiling baby: Melissa Adams pictured here as a baby in 2005. Melissa said that, from as young as 12 months old, Melissa wasn't hitting her development milestones . 'I was told countless times it was only a phase but my motherly instinct kicked in and I knew it wasn't,' says Kathryn. Melissa was eventually misdiagnosed as having autism when she was a two-year-old. 'I knew it wasn't autism,' says Kathryn, who is also mum to 13-year-old Jacob. 'They had made me feel incredibly paranoid when they didn't take me seriously and then they just stuck this label on her.' Determined to prove the doctors wrong and help her daughter, Kathryn started doing her own research on the internet. She typed in Melissa's symptoms Angelman syndrome appeared. The condition affects the nervous system, causing severe physical and intellectual disability. 'Although Melissa didn't tick all the boxes for it, she ticked most of them,' explains Kathryn. Melissa, pictured here, is now 10. When she was two years old her mother Kathryn managed to get her a referral to Alder Hey Children's Hospital in Liverpool for a genetics test . 'I now know that was because Angelman syndrome covers quite a wide spectrum and Melissa has one of the rarest types.' She returned to her doctors but, again, felt like she was, 'banging my head against a brick wall.' 'Even with all the information out in front of them they still didn't think it was Angelman,' says Kathryn. 'One doctor even told me that Melissa was 'too pretty' to have it, which I found really quite shocking.' Kathryn finally managed to get her daughter a referral to Alder Hey Children's Hospital in Liverpool for a genetics test when she was two years old. 'It had been a real battle to get doctors to take me seriously,' says Kathryn. 'The test was expensive so they were reluctant to refer her but I literally begged them.' The doctors even agreed to carry out a second test, after the first came back negative. 'But the second test proved I had been right all along,' says Kathryn. Kathryn, pictured her with daughter Melissa, along with friends and family, has now set up the Melissa Adams . Angelman Foundation in a bid to help raise awareness of the condition and raise funds to find a treatment or cure . Melissa was finally diagnosed at the age of three with Angelman syndrome and, just a few months later, was also diagnosed with epilepsy. She who has mobility issues which often cause her to stumble as she walks, . Kathryn, who lives with her husband Stephen, 52, a service engineer, said: 'I felt a real mixture of emotions when she was finally diagnosed. 'I was relieved that we finally had answers but I was also very upset because I knew Melissa would never grow up to enjoy a normal childhood. I . 'I knew she would never really get better and that was hard. 'At the same time I was also really angry that it had taken so long for a correct diagnosis and I felt like, if I hadn't persevered, she would have been stuck with the label that she was autistic.' There is currently no treatment for Angelman syndrome, although research into the condition continues. Kathryn, along with friends and family, has now set up the Melissa Adams  Angelman Foundation in a bid to help raise awareness of the condition and raise funds to find a treatment or cure. Saints stars Mark Flanagan, Sia Soliola and Willie Manu all recently become ambassadors for the charity too. 'Melissa is now a very happy girl and she has this excessive laughter which gets us all going,' says Kathryn. 'But I suspect there are a lot of children who have been misdiagnosed because many doctors have never heard of the syndrome. 'If I hadn't done my own research, we would never be where we are today. I was angry they hadn't listened to me from the start.'

"By . Mia De Graaf . The number of people forced from their homes worldwide has surged past 50 million for the first time since the Second World War, figures reveal. At the end of last year, 51.2 million people sought shelter - almost equivalent to the entire population of England. Syrians fleeing the bloodletting at home are believed to be the reason for the spike, up six million from 2012. Shelter: Zarina 6, lives at a camp for Afghans in Kabul, Afghanistan. Figures released as part of World Refugee Day reveal 51.2 million people across the world are now living as refugees . Safety: Fatima 7, who lives at the same camp. The number of people forced to leave their homes has surged past the 50million mark for the first time in the Second World War . The figures, released in the UN's annual Global Trends Report, spell a dramatic challenge for aid organisations as the crisis in Iraq intensifies. 'The world has shown a limited capacity to prevent conflicts and to find a timely solution for them,' said U.N. High Commissioner Antonio Gutteres. 'Today, we not only have an absence of a global governance system, but we have sort of an unclear sense of power in the world,' Gutteres told reporters in the Lebanese capital of Beirut, where the global report was launched Friday. The massive increase was mainly driven by Syria's civil war. Report: The figures, released today, spell out the challenge aid organisations face as crises in Iraq, Ukraine and Syria intensify . Alone: Two Eritrean children pictured sitting on the sidewalk in Sanaa, Yemen. Thousands of Syrians leaving their home country due to the crisis in the region are thought to have contributed to the spike . By the end of last year, 2.5 million Syrians had become refugees in neighboring countries and more than 6.5 million had been displaced within Syria, the U.N. agency said. The daunting numbers — which are straining the resources of host countries and aid organizations alike — also are a stark reflection of the ongoing conflicts and persecutions from other countries, including the Central African Republic and South Sudan. At the end of 2012, there were 45.2 million displaced in the world, according to the agency. 'These numbers represent a quantum leap in forced displacement around the world,' Gutteres added. Violence: Scores of people have fled cities in northern Iraq - such as this family from Mosul - following an ISIS surge in the region. The figures were released in the UN's annual Global Trends Report . Flee: A woman carries her belongings heading to the Ukrainian-Russian border checkpoint in Izvaryne.

Pictured are groups of people leaving Ukraine . 'For the first time since the Second World War, we had in 2013 more than 50 million people displaced by conflict and persecution either crossing borders or within the borders of their countries.' The over-50-million number includes refugees and asylum-seekers who fled abroad as well as people displaced within their own countries. The data was compiled from government, non-government partner organizations and UNHCR's own records. Of 51.2 million displaced worldwide last year, 16.7 million were refugees outside their countries' borders.

Nearly 12 million of them are cared for by U.N. agencies. More than half of the refugees under UNHCR's care — 6.3 million — had been in exile for more than five years, the agency said. By country, the biggest populations of refugees were Afghans, Syrians and Somalis, the report said. The countries hosting the largest number of refugees were Pakistan, Iran and Lebanon, whose stability is threatened by the raging Syrian war, now in its fourth year. More than a million Syrians have registered in Lebanon as refugees since the conflict in their country started in March 2011.

"By . Associated Press . Tens of thousands more veterans than previously reported are forced to wait at least a month for medical appointments at Veterans Affairs hospitals and clinics, according to an updated audit of 731 VA medical facilities released on Thursday. The updated report includes new figures showing that the wait times actually experienced at most VA facilities were shorter than those on waiting lists for pending appointments. For instance, new patients at the Atlanta VA hospital waited about an average of 44 days for an appointment in April, the new report said. But the average wait for pending appointments at Atlanta was 66 days. Acting Veterans Affairs Secretary Sloan Gibson speaks during a news conference at the VA Medical Center in Washington on Wednesday to release the results from its Nationwide Access Audit . Similar disparities in average wait times . were found around the country. Pending appointments, for example, don't . include patients who walk into a clinic and get immediate or quick . treatment, VA officials said. They also don't reflect rescheduled . appointments or those that are moved up because of openings due to . cancellations. VA officials said the two sets of data complement one another, but both are evidence that many veterans face long waits for care. More than 56,000 veterans were waiting more than 90 days for an initial appointment, the new report said. 'In many communities across the country, veterans wait too long for the high quality care they've earned and deserve,' acting VA Secretary Sloan Gibson said Thursday. The department has reached out to 70,000 veterans to get them off waiting lists and into clinics, Gibson said, 'but there is still much more work to be done.' The report released Thursday showed that about 10 percent of veterans seeking medical care at VA hospitals and clinics have to wait at least 30 days for an appointment. That's more than double the 4 percent of veterans the government said last week were forced to endure long waits. This 2007 file photo shows Walter Reed Army Medical Hospital, a Veteran's facility in Washington . Gibson called the increase unfortunate, but said it was probably an indication that more reliable data was being reported by VA schedulers, rather than a big increase in veteran wait times. Administrators at local VA medical centers questioned the results of an audit released June 9, which looked only at pending appointments. The report did not match internal data on completed appointments showing waits actually were far shorter, the local officials said. The reliability of both sets of data is in question. The VA is investigating widespread manipulation of appointment data by schedulers following an uproar over since-confirmed allegations that dozens of veterans died while awaiting appointments at the Phoenix VA medical center. Some 13 percent of schedulers surveyed by the auditors reported being told by supervisors to falsify appointment records to make patient waits appear shorter. The VA's inspector general has cited a since-abandoned performance bonus system as a reason for the falsifications, which schedulers used to mask frequent, long delays in treatment for veterans. VA Secretary Eric Shinseki resigned three weeks ago amid an election-year firestorm over the treatment delays and waiting list problems at VA facilities nationwide. U.S. Military veteran and amputee Lloyd Epps swings a driver while at the gait and motion analysis lab at the Veterans Administration hospital  where many veterans must wait up to a month for an appointment . Shinseki took the blame for what he decried as a 'lack of integrity' through the VA network, which serves nearly 9 million veterans. The House and Senate have approved separate bills to allow more veterans who can't get timely VA appointments to see local doctors listed instead. The proposals also would make it easier to fire senior VA regional officials and hospital administrators. The June 9 audit found that more than 57,000 veterans were waiting at least 90 days for their first VA medical appointments, and an additional 64,000 appeared to have fallen through the cracks, never getting appointments after enrolling for VA care within the past 10 years. The new report said the number of veterans waiting more than 90 days dropped to about 56,300. About 46,400 veterans still have never gotten an appointment despite seeking one over the past decade, the report said. Gibson, who replaced Shinseki May 30, said he still is not 100 percent confident that all wait times listed on VA computers — and its audits — are accurate. 'I have vastly greater confidence in the quality' of wait-time data being reported by VA employees, he said during a speech this week in Washington. ""But I can't look at the entire database and say it's correct either.""

"By . Corey Charlton . Customs authorities have busted a man attempting to smuggle more than $50,000 worth of cocaine into the U.S. via homemade cookies. Guatemalan man Mauricio Isidro Rivera Hernandez was stopped at the airport when customs officials decided to take a closer inspection at his delicious looking baking. The three packs of cookies inside his check-in luggage revealed a hidden, and extremely valuable, stash of drugs. The tasty looking homemade cookies were found to have more than $50,000 of cocaine stuffed inside them . The cookies were found to have 118 small pellets of cocaine jammed inside them with an estimated street value of more than $50,000. Hernandez was arriving at Newark Liberty International Airport, in New York, on June 5 on a flight from Guatemala City when the discovery was made. U.S. Customs and Border Protection said the drugs were found during a routine inspection of his luggage. He has now been handed over to police and is facing drug smuggling charges. Customs officials discovered the cocaine, worth more than $50,000, in the man's baking when he landed at Newark Liberty International Airport after disembarking a flight from Central America . Drug smugglers will use almost any method possible to bring drugs into the U.S. Only two days ago U.S. Customs and Border Protection officials stopped a man at John F. Kennedy International Airport whose luggage handle rails were surprisingly thick. Disembarking a flight from Guyana, officials searched the man's luggage, and discovered a white powdery substance that tested positive for cocaine. The amount of cocaine eventually seized had a street value of $82,000. Director of CBP's New York Field Operations, Robert E. Perez, said the organisaton would remain vigilant in trying to prevent smuggling. 'CBP Officers continue to adapt to various concealment methods employed by these smugglers, and CBP remains ever vigilant in protecting the United States from the distribution of these dangerous drugs,' he said.","Officials search luggage of man bringing homemade cookies into U.S.

"By . Corey Charlton . New York Governor Andrew Cuomo has announced the state will legalise medical marijuana use . It will soon be possible to get high for medical reasons in New York State - but smoking the drug will remain prohibited. Governor Andrew Cuomo has announced legislation to make New York the 23rd U.S. state to legalise marijuana use for medicinal purposes. However, users will have to vaporize or ingest it through food or pills. Not only does the new law make the region one of the largest states to allow the use of medical marijuana, it also cements its status as one of the country's more fiercely smoke free. New York has enacted in recent years several crackdowns restricting the areas in which people can smoke tobacco. Under the Bloomberg Administration, a 2011 bill was enacted banning smoking in public areas such as parks, beaches and boardwalks, sports stadiums and pedestrian plazas. This was then recently extended to include e-cigarettes. Governor Cuomo's marijuana announcement stated acquiring the drug would involve a certification and registry process and will be available to people suffering from cancer, HIV/AIDS, Parkinson's Disease, multiple sclerosis, epilepsy, inflammatory bowel disease, Huntington's Disease and more. Registry cards will be provided for patients who qualify for the programme and no-one would be able to possess more than a 30 day supply at once. Governor Cuomo said the rules struck the right 'balance' juggling helping those in pain and suffering and avoiding risks to public health. 'Medical marijuana has the capacity to do a lot of good for a lot of people who are in pain and suffering, and are in desperate need of a treatment that will provide some relief,' he said. 'At the same time, medical marijuana is a difficult issue because there are risks to public health and safety that have to be averted. 'I believe this bill is the right balance, and I commend the members of the legislature who worked so hard on this measure.' The drug will be available to those suffering from often painful illnesses, but they will not be able to smoke it .","New York to become 23rd U.S. state to legalise use of medical marijuana .

"By . Chris Pleasance . Dirk Vhale and Bob Tur, two rival TV helicopter pilots who covered the OJ Simpson Bronco chase, have become friends after becoming Dana Vhale (left) and Zoey Tur (right) Two rival TV helicopter pilots who fought publicly over who was the first to spot the infamous OJ Simpson car chase have now become firm friends - after both becoming women. On June 17, 1994, Dirk Vahle and Bob Tur were the first pilots to spot OJ Simpson's white Bronco as the sports star lead police on a slow-speed chase while holding a gun to his head. But 20 years later the reporters have found friendship after both having hormone replacement therapy, becoming Dana Vahle and Zoey Tur. The pair hadn't spoken to each other since arguing over who spotted the OJ first, but got in touch again a year ago after mutual friend and fellow pilot Desiree Horton told Tur to contact Vahle. According to KPCC, Tur said: 'Desiree told me I should get in touch with Dirk Vahle. I said, 'Why? Dirk Vahle is an a**hole. She said, 'Because Dirk is now Dana.'"" Meanwhile Vahle, who began his transformation two years before Tur, found out about Tur's change from a news report, saying: 'You've got to be f**king kidding me!' The two now support each other, with Vahle giving advice to Tur on the reassignment process after Tur decided to make his treatment public. Despite their news rivalry being long in the past, the pair still argue over what happened during the OJ chase. Tur (pictured) was told to contact Vahle by mutual friend and fellow helicopter reporter Desiree Horton, who explained that Vahle was also undergoing hormone replacement therapy . Tur (pictured before treatment left, and during, right) began her change two years after Vahle, who read about Tur's transformation in a news report . Vahle recalled: 'Everybody at my station feels very strongly that we were actually there before Bob Tur which, of course, is something we all wanted to do in that market at that point.' She claims that Tur's footage appeared on air sooner only because her station, NBC, delayed getting the feed through, while CBS put the footage up immediately. Simpson was pursued by police after failing to turn himself in, charged with the double murder of Nicole Simpson and Ronald Goldman. Tur and Vahle fought publicly over who spotted OJ Simpson's white Bronco in 1994 as he lead police on a slow-speed car chase. Vahle claims she was first on the scene, but Tur's footage was broadcast first . Simpson was due to hand himself over to police after being charged with the double murder of ex-wife Nicole and Ronald Goldman (scene pictured left) but instead lead officers on a car chase . He left a rambling note leading many to believe he was about to commit suicide, but instead forced his friend Al Cowlings to drive him along in his Bronco while holding a gun to his own head. While Tur and Khale were the first on the scene, eventually 20 news helicopters joined the pursuit, which was watched on TV by an estimated 95million people. Meanwhile thousands of spectators lined the route to wave at Simpson, with some carrying banners encouraging him to run.","Dirk Vahle and Bob Tur were rival male TV helicopter pilots in California .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A man dubbed the 'Swiss Cheese Pervert' has pleaded guilty in a Philadelphia court after being charged for flashing women while holding slices of Swiss cheese. Christopher Pagano, 42, was charged with stalking, indecent exposure, harassment and lewdness for his crimes against four women in January. Several of the victims were able to record video or take a photograph of Pagano as he harrassed them from his car while brandishing cheese. Playing with food: Christopher Pagano's cheese fetish has hopefully come to an end since he pleaded guilty today . According to Philly.com, he would drive up to his victims, expose himself to them and ask them if they would like to be paid to engage in sex acts with him involving Swiss cheese. Pagano, from Norristown, was arrested in January and pleaded guilty today. He's been sentenced to eight years probation and must report to sex offender counseling . Furthermore, he may not use a car except to drive to work, church or medical appointments, for one year. Pagano is a married father of a 12-year-old girl, reports Philly.com. Cheesy: The Mayfair Town Watch warned women of the 'Swiss Cheese Pervert,' pictured, on its Facebook page earlier this year . During their investigation, police . unearthed court documents and a mugshot from 2009 reveal that Pagano was . arrested after he allegedly 'removed a large block of cheese from his . pocket' and asked a woman on the street if it would be alright to give . her '$20 to rub the Swiss cheese on his penis.' At the time of his 2009 arrest, Pagano pleaded guilty to disorderly conduct but a solicitation charge against him was dismissed. Going . back three years to 2006, Pagano was again arrested and charged with . solicitation and disorderly conduct according to the Philadelphia . Magazine. The . Norristown Police Department was unable to confirm that cheese was . involved in this incident, however detective James Angelucci, who worked . the 2006 and 2009 case said that he thought it was. 'I . was working the 2006 detail as well,' said Angelucci. 'And I believe . cheese was on the menu, but I’m not completely sure. If my memory serves . me, it was Swiss.' The bizarre case shocked many residents but Gabby Chest, from nearby Bridesburg, recognized the fetish straight away and made her own report to police. In July 2012, when she was just 19, she set up a profile on dating site OkCupid and within days had an inbox from a 'really strange guy' with a very specific request. 'He said he was looking for someone . to perform masturbation on him with cheese,' Ms Chest told the Daily . News. 'He kept saying how strong his urges were and how desperate he was . to find someone to help him with them.' She . added: 'There's no doubt it was him; it looked exactly like the picture . on his profile. I was scared and shocked. I never thought the guys you . see on those sites would be so close to me.' Hands up: Pagano was arrested at his home in Norristown at gunpoint in January . Dairy don't: The man dubbed the Swiss Cheese Pervert had been driving around and asking women if they'd like to pleasure him with a piece of cheese . In the message, the man called . 'Chris' explained he developed the fetish after struggling to find women . and start relationships as a young man because he was overweight and . always judged on his looks. 'So I developed this fetish to help me deal with my sexual urges,' he wrote. 'I found that women tend to like dairy products, and settled on cheese to represent the girl. thus I started having sex with cheese.' Another woman, commenting on a Phillymag.com story, shared an OKCupid message her sister received from 'Chris' some four years ago, which was even more shocking. 'I love the way Swiss cheese feels against my penis. Either as slices of Swiss cheese being wrapped around my penis or a chunk of Swiss cheese being rubbed against my penis,' he wrote. 'I love even more when a woman uses the Swiss cheese to pleasure me. Or simply wraps Swiss cheese slices around my penis and allows me to hang out with her as I wear the cheese.' He explained that he prefers having sex with cheese over traditional sex and jokes 'I am lucky I never became a rapist,' suggesting this was an alternative to his fromage infatuation. Victim: A woman tweeted this picture of the 'Swiss Cheese Pervert' with the comment 'I met this dude a few weeks ago' #creep . Chis went on: 'I tried many different kinds of cheese, like American, Provolone, chez whiz, jack, and cheddar, but settled on Swiss as the best. First and foremost, if ever a picture of cheese is used, most of the time they use a representation of Swiss cheese. But also because of it's eye patterns, texture, and the way it feels against my penis.' While he didn't offer Ms Chest cash in exchange for the sexual favor, so as not to suggest she was a prostitute, he did offer this young woman $50 if she'd pleasure him using his preferred method. He described in the expansive letter, however, that when he was younger he had far more stamina for cheese sex. 'I was able to wrap and wear a good 1 ½ pounds of Swiss cheese against my penis, and wear the Swiss cheese for hours at a time, before I would climax from just having the Swiss cheese on my penis,' Chris wrote. But in a strange twist, he insists he doesn't like Swiss cheese, only mozzarella, and would never consumer the cheese he has used on himself. 'One last note, I do not like cheese, except for mozzarella, and that is the one cheese I have never used on myself,' he explained. 'So no I do not eat the cheese after I am done using it for pleasure, it is discarded. I am always asked that question.'","Christopher Pagano, 42, pleaded guilty to various charges after flashing women while holding Swiss cheese .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A 27-year-old woman went into labor Wednesday while trying to enter the country through the Port of Lukeville in Arizona. Federal authorities at the southern Arizona crossing ended up having to help deliver the baby. A short time later, she successfully gave birth to a healthy baby boy. The boy will be a United States citizen since he was born on American soil. On the border: The woman gave birth at the border at Lukeville Port in Southern Arizona. Border agents were forced to assist with the delivery . Overcrowded: Children sleep under red cross blankets on the floor of a Border Patrol center in Texas . Ajo Ambulance was notified, but the Tohono O'odham tribal member went into labor and required the assistance of U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers medically trained as EMTs. The officers assessed the woman and determined she would probably deliver prior to the ambulance's arrival . Once the woman gave birth, she and her newborn son were taken to a hospital in Phoenix. The woman's name hasn't been released . Such chaotic scenes have become a familiar sign in recent months with young boys and girls sleeping under blankets wall-to-wall on concrete floors. A few hundred miles away at a crowded Border Patrol station in south Texas, thousands of immigrants are being held before they are transferred to shelters across the U.S. More than 47,000 unaccompanied children have entered the country illegally this year it what President Obama is calling an 'urgent humanitarian situation'. Waiting: Illegal immigrant children are held in Texas, Arizona and Oklahoma being moved to shelters . Border Patrol stations like the one in Brownsville were not meant for long-term custody. Immigrants are supposed to wait there until they are processed and taken to detention centers. But the surge in children arriving without their parents has overwhelmed the government. The surge, which has been building for three years, comes amid a steep overall increase in immigrant arrests in southernmost Texas. The children are mostly from Central America. They pose a particular challenge because the law requires Customs and Border Protection to transfer them to the Department of Health and Human Services within 72 hours. Contact: An officer helps boys make phone calls as they try to reach relatives who could take over their care . That agency's network of about 100 shelters around the country has been over capacity for months and is now caring for more than 7,600 children. Children began backing up in already overcrowded Border Patrol stations. Eventually, the Border Patrol began flying them to Arizona, where it set up a processing center. From there, they are sent to private shelters or temporary housing at barracks on military bases in California, Texas and Oklahoma. Most of the children are turning themselves in to U.S. Border Patrol agents, who transport them to a facility where they are given 'notices to appear' before an immigration judge between 10 and 90 days later. HHS takes over after that, drawing on a $1 billion budget to house, feed and otherwise care for the children until a suitable adult family member can be located to claim them. Overwhelmed: Children, many from Central America, color pictures at the center. Border Patrol stations have been overrun with immigrant children in the past year . Meanwhile, Texas Gov. Rick Perry and other state officials have authorized the Texas Department of Public Safety to begin emergency 'surge operations' along the border with Mexico in response to an influx of immigrants making the illegal crossing, mostly women and children from Central America. State leaders authorized the department to spend on the surge as needed and provided an additional $1.3 million per week, according to a statement Perry’s office released late Wednesday. Department officials will be expected to report results of the surge to the governor and Legislature 'periodically,' the statement said. 'Texas can't afford to wait for Washington to act on this crisis, and we will not sit idly by while the safety and security of our citizens are threatened,' Perry said. 'Until the federal government recognizes the danger it’s putting our citizens in by its inaction to secure the border, Texas law enforcement must do everything they can to keep our citizens and communities safe.' The surge is expected to continue through the end of the year, the statement said.","Heavily pregnant woman ended up giving birth before she could be taken to hospital .

"By . Kieran Corcoran . Payday loans company Wonga has been accused of 'censorship by stealth' after using legal threats to remove a work of parody from the internet. Twitter user @Brandy_Snap posted an image showing an 18th-Century debtors' prison, with the Wonga logo superimposed, including the mock catchphrase 'Your soul is ours'. The image was highlighting widespread anger at the loans company, which offers loans at representative annual interest rates of 5853 per cent. Legal threats: Wonga took legal action over this image, which superimposes a character from its adverts onto a scene of a debtors' prison . And in a bizarre move, Wonga then called its own legal team 'soulless' for trying to suppress the image, which has now been posted hundreds more times in protest. It features a painting by William Hogarth, an artist famous for depicting social decay in the 1700s, with the head of one of Wonga's puppet-like TV advert characters superimposed on a figure. The Wonga mascot is surrounded by wretched and impoverished captives in London's Fleet Prison, where hundreds of people who owed money were subjected to cruel punishments. The original image is part of a Hogarth series called A Rake's Progress, which shows the rise and fall of a wealthy man who squanders his fortune and ends up destitute. The legal notice, delivered by Twitter, is signed by . representative James Johnson from the legal department of Wonga's parent . company. It accuses the owner of the Twitter account of infringing the . company's copyright by using part of its adverts. Ads: The above image has been doctored to include 'Earl', a puppet character who often features in Wonga's adverts . Original: The famous scene shows wretched figures stuck in Fleet prison, where debtors were sent in the 1700s . The . text of the warning identifies 'infringing acts' on the grounds that . Wonga did not give its permission for the images to be used. However it has been claimed that the legal complaint is baseless and that the company is simply using its legal muscle to quash dissent. Speaking to MailOnline the Twitter user, who declined to be named, said the legal complaint was a 'pretext'. The image seized upon for the parody is one of an eight-part series by Hogarth depicting the rise and fall of a wealthy man. Tom Rakewell, the central figure, inherits from his miserly father and proceeds to spend all the money on his lavish lifestyle. He quickly squanders all his money on clothes, women and parties, landing him in Fleet prison, which is the penultimate frame of the series. Rakewell can be seen surrounded by angry creditors, while his wife and lover languish in the corner. In the next picture he has been driven insane and languished in the Bedlam Hospital lunatic asylum. Hundreds of years later the pictures inspired Igor Stravinsky to writer an opera of the same name. They are currently housed in Sir John Soane's museum in Central London. He said: 'Wonga . have decided to take this aggressive approach to squashing any parody . or criticism of their company, using the pretext of copyright abuse. 'I . think there's an important point of principle here. If they get away . with this, it's the beginning of censorship by stealth on Twitter. 'I've taken advice and it's been pointed out that Wonga are on really rocky ground with this. But . if it came to the crunch it would mean traipsing over to a Californian . court and I haven't got the time or the money to go there. 'Of . course the whole thing has rebounded on them. They're getting so much . adverse publicity, and everybody has started retweeting it.' When contacted by the MailOnline for comment, Wonga refused to explain why it took the action, beyond referencing a tweet which described its own lawyers as 'soulless'. A post on the OpenWonga Twitter feed responding to an outcry about the move said: 'What can we say? Our lawyers are a soulless bunch and take the protection of our brand very seriously.' Although Wonga only recently decided to take action, the image in question was first published in January this year for a satirical competition. 'Aggressive': The take-down notice sent to the Twitter user accuses him of copyright infringements . The complaint was prompted by the image being uploaded again on April 6, which led to the take-down notice being submitted yesterday. Prominent figures including the Archbishop of Canterbury have attacked the company for the way it treats its customers, who are often left in severe financial difficulty. Last year Justin Welby said he told Wonga's boss that the Church of England aimed to 'compete you out of existence' by backing community-based lending schemes instead, with lower interest rates. Wonga was in the spotlight again this week after the Advertising Standards Agency banned an advert designed to explain away the huge 5853 per cent interest rates. The ad, which attempted to demonstrate how consumers would never actually pay thousands of per cent of interest on the loans because they are too short-term, was deemed to be confusing and that Wonga was being 'irresponsible' in trying to distract attention from the high rates. Response: Wonga called its own lawyers 'soulless' for sending the warning .","Twitter user created parody comparing payday loans to debtors' prison .

"By . Darren Boyle . Adventurer Johann Westhauser will not require neurosurgery despite suffering a fractured skull and broken eye socket after being trapped for almost two weeks at the bottom of Germany's deepest cave. The 52-year-old explorer was flown to the Murnau Trauma Centre after being rescued from the Riesending cave. Mr Westhauser was unable to make his own way to the surface after being struck by falling rocks. More than 700 rescuers were involved in the operation after the German caver was injured on June 8. Scroll down for video . Explorer Johann Westhauser, pictured, suffered a fractured skull, broken eye socket and internal bleeding when he was struck by rocks while more than 1,000 metres down Germany's deepest cave . Voker Buehren, medical director at the Murnau hospital treating Mr Westhauser said the caver would spend between two and four weeks at the clinic before continuing his rehabilitation at home . Mr Westhauser was trapped almost 1,000 metres below the surface of the Reisending cave system in the German alps . Medical director Volker Beuhren said his patient would not require any neurosurgery despite his injuries. Mr Westhauser will spend up to four weeks recuperating at the hospital before returning home. Mr Westhauser also suffered some internal bleeding as a result of his accident. During a video conference, the adventurer appeared to have some difficulty speaking. Experts spent five days planning Mr Westhauser's rescue operation. Bavarian mountain rescue chief Norbert Heiland said: 'A chapter of Alpine rescue history has been written here over the last 12 days.' The rescuers use an ingenious system of ropes, winches and pulleys to transport Mr Westhauser through the perilous cave system . More than 700 people were involved in the operation to rescue Mr Westhauser in what has been described as 'a chapter of Alpine rescue history' Mr Westhauser is winched to safety at the end of his two-week long ordeal by rescuers from the Bavarian Mountain Patrol . A team of 728 people from Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Italy and Croatia were involved in the massive operation. Italian rescuer Roberto Conti said: 'Since the birth of caving, there have been only two incidents of this depth, complexity and difficulty.' A fit expert could climb from the accident site to the entrance in about 12 hours, but rescuers had to haul Mr Westhauser on a stretcher. The cave entrance is on a mountainside, 5,900ft above sea level. Mr Westhauser had entered the cave system with two colleagues to carry out research and measurements. Rescuers said a fit, expert climber would be able to get from the accident scene to surface in 12 hours. However, due to the level of publicity attracted by the rescue, which some authorities said would not be possible, regional politicians now fear the area could attract 'risk tourism'. Interior Minister Joachim Herrmann advocated shutting the cave entrance to ensure it was accessed only by experts. Mr Westhauser is carried the final couple of metres to the German Police helicopter tasked with rushing him to hospital for emergency treatment .","Johann Westhauser was injured while exploring Germany's deepest cave .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Another of Donald Sterling's offensive rants has been caught on tape - this time a profanity-laced voicemail to his doctor in which he calls the man 'stupid,' 'incompetent' and a 'tramp.' The disgraced former LA Clippers owner directed a barrage of abuse at Dr. James Spar, one of the psychiatrists who performed medical tests on him recently, and the recording was used by Shelly Sterling's lawyers in court today to show her estranged husband's menacing behavior. In the tape, obtained by TMZ Sports, Sterling explodes at the doctor after he determined he was mentally incompetent. 'I'm not incompetent, you're incompetent ... you stupid f***ing doctor!!!' he can be heard saying, before threatening to call UCLA and have Dr. Spar fired immediately. Scroll down for audio .

Just three months after breaking nine vertebrate in her back in a terrifying sky-diving accident, Miss World Australia finalist Stephanie Campbell is back on the pageant scene and ready to tackle her next big challenge. On March 16, less than 12 hours since qualifying for the state finals in another competition - Miss Universe Australia - the experienced skydiver hit trouble during her first jump of the day. With a crash landing the 24-year-old hit the ground with such force she broke bones in her back, her right wrist, snapped six ribs which punctured both her lungs, and suffered a serious concussion with bruising to her face and body. Scroll down for video . Stephanie Campbell suffered serious injuries after a horrific skydiving accident in March, pictured modelling before the crash . 'A lot of the other skydivers assisted me... but when they said CareFlight was on the way I knew it was serious,' Ms Campbell told the MailOnline. 'One of the paramedics, Jeff, said he thought that I was going to die in the helicopter.' Despite doubts from many doctors and gruelling weeks spent slowly recovering, the Brisbane-born thrill seeker is back on her feet with greater determination than ever. 'I think you have to be so grateful for everything that you have, and it’s just made me more determined to give back.' In the first few days after the accident, Ms Campbell's body was supported using a specially molded spinal brace. 'They had to mold a spinal brace to my body and chest a few days after the accident.’ To take the impression doctors had to lift and move Ms Campbell’s body while she was still seriously injured, which could have caused further injury if anything went wrong. Stephanie had a specially molded spinal brace following the accident (left) and shocked doctors when she was able to walk just six days later (right) She was airlifted to Princess Alexandra Hospital following the horrific skydiving accident in March which almost left her paralysed . 'There were a lot of challenging experiences during that time and that was the one that held the greatest fear for me because obviously paralysis is something to be pretty scared of,' Ms Campbell revealed. She said that now her recovery is going smoothly, she is even more motivated to do all she can to help others who are at any disadvantage, especially those who struggle with mobility. Her next feat will be climbing the Story Bridge in Brisbane, a fundraising endeavor which is part of her role the upcoming Miss World Australia Finals. 'Brisbane's Story Bridge Adventure Climb has generously agreed to donate 50 percent of the price of standard bridge climb tickets purchased between 13-19 July jointly to Variety QLD and the Centre for Healthy Brain Ageing. 'If we sell 1000 tickets each charity will come away with $25,000.' The fundraiser called 'Climb for a Cause' that Ms Campbell has organised is something she is looking forward to, and when asked if she would take part in the climb Ms Campbell said she couldn't wait. 'Definitely - I thinks that's why this project is so close my heart.' 'For the first five days after the accident when I didn’t have the ability to walk I was in a spinal bed and I couldn’t even move on my own.' The 24-year-old Brisbane woman is recovering fast and can now run, and will compete in the finals of Miss World Australia in July . The thrill seeker suffered serious injuries (left) but is now set to compete in the Miss World Australia finals in July, pictured right modelling . On Monday, Ms Campbell ran the longest distance since her accident - five kilometres - and hopes to keep improving her health now she's much more able and agile. 'My goal was 30 minutes and I was just eight seconds over that,' she said. Ms Campbell also told of her experience when meeting the paramedics who rescued her at a CareFlight even she spoke at last week. When she came face to face with Jeff, one of the men who attended to her accident, the 24-year-old said she was more emotional than expected and told of how comforting he was while she was being airlifted to hospital. 'I remember Jeff was squeezing my good hand, and he was really reassuring.' Speaking of the upcoming Miss World Australia competition, whose core objective is 'beauty with a purpose' Ms Campbell revealed one of her hidden talents which she will showcase at the event in July. After narrowly avoiding crippling life-long injuries, Ms Campbell is ready to strut her stuff for the crown . 'I play the alto saxophone... But my last performance was at the valedictory,' she said. Despite keeping busy with many other ventures, the adventurer said she's not rushing to jump back in to skydiving just yet. 'There’s a lot of other things I'm really focusing on, like finishing off my master’s degree.' 'But never say never, I was always aware of the risks...

"By . Bianca London . Thought the side boob was bad? Cringed at the concept of a 'bumster' dress, which exposes your bottom cleavage a la Rihanna? Well, it just got a whole lot worse. The latest fashion trend sweeping the red carpet - thanks to Rihanna, Kendall Jenner and Georgia May Jagger - is the 'almost naked' look, which, as the name suggests, exposes acres of flesh. Kendall Jenner was the most recent celebrity to embrace the trend when she dressed to shock as she hit the red carpet at the MuchMusic Video Awards in Toronto on Sunday. Scroll down for video . New trend? Kendall Jenner shocked fans when she rocked up to the MuchMusic awards in a gown slashed at the crotch but it seems she's simply joining in on the 'practically naked' trend that seems to be sweeping Tinseltown . Revealing . her pelvic bones in a gown slashed from the floor to her waist, the . teen seemed intent upon stealing the spotlight at the Canadian bash. The . 18-year-old reality star chose a white embellished long-sleeved Fausto . Puglisi gown featuring elaborate embellishment in the form of jewels. Even her . little sister Kylie, 16, seemed rather surprised by the daring choice - . pointing at it in wonder as the pair posed for photographers ahead of . hosting the awards show. Kendall looked nonchalant despite her revealing gown - perhaps due to her experience as a catwalk model. Indeed, . she took to Instagram later in the evening to share some photos of her . daring frock, which she captioned: 'why do one slit when you can do . TWO!? #MMVAs.' Would YOU dare to bare? Rihanna was the A-lister who took the trend to a whole new level when she arrived at the CFDA's in a fishnet gown . The . gown . was otherwise gorgeous with its striking silver and gold jewelled . detailing on the bodice, all the way down the centre of the outfit as . well as along the sleeves. And Kendall isn't alone in her choice of barely-there red carpet style. Rihanna, who was named 'Fashion Icon' at . the recent CFDA awards, was the centre of attention at the New York . event when she stepped out in a daring, totally sheer . embellished halter dress which showed off every inch of her slim figure. The revealing outfit was custom-made by designer Adam Selman and comprised of a . total of 216,000 Swarovski crystals. Trial on trend: Supermodel Georgia May Jagger has also given the practically naked trend a whirl, a new fashion statement that one stylist says 'worries her' The singer completed her look with a blinged-out Adam Selman headscarf and gloves. Speaking about Kendall and Rihanna's fashion statement, Grazia's Katherine Ormerod, who spotted the trend, said: 'The question here isn't just of changing mores, but of taste. The red carpet is after all a professional environment rather than say, a strip club. By so obviously ""going commando"" and revealing her hipbones, Kendall is clearly trying to court controversy. 'Perhaps in a world in which Miley Cyrus works a front wedgie and sideboob is acceptable for the office, such reservations are dated.' Other celebrities to court the look have included daring Iggy Azalea, Miranda Kerr, Kristen Stewart, Georgia May Jagger and, of course, Miley Cyrus. She's a fan of it too! Singer and model Iggy Azalea wore a daring slashed gown just like Kendall's . MailOnline's resident fashion expert, Simon Glazin, said: 'There's a very fine line between showing too much of yourself and still remaining chic, and unfortunately most celebs get it wrong. 'If we wanted to see bums, nipples and pokey out hip bones we could all take a trip to our local strip club and watch Crystal Chandelier do her thing on a pole. 'I would go for the naked look, nothing gets the blood pumping more than a bit of skin!' - Patrick Hyslop, 25, London . 'I think it’s really try-hard. Surely it’s sexier to wonder what’s underneath rather than have it thrust in your face from the word go. Guys like the chase and a bit of mystery. It’s like sex without foreplay.' - Jay Young, 25, London . 'Rihanna took it way too far at the CFDAs in THAT sheer dress. It was classless and cheap (even though there were thousands of tiny crystals stitched onto it). Anna Wintour got an eyeful of nipple. So unnecessary. 'There's ways to show off your body...Stella McCartney created sheer panelled dresses that looked exquisite. Jane Fonda even wore one. I'm not a fan of seeing jutting hip bones and an untidy wax. Cover up a bit ladies!' Celebrity stylist Alex Longmore said: 'The ""practically naked"" trend worries me. Not only is it becoming a competition on the red carpet as to who can bare more, but it seems to be sticking around for AW14. 'The Cavalli, Pucci and McQueen winter catwalk shows were full of long sheer dresses perfect for appearing in public semi-naked. 'To me there is nothing elegant about this look, it leaves little to the imagination and it doesn’t set a very good example to fans of the stars who don’t have the luxury of stepping out at night surrounded by bodyguards. 'I'm hoping this trend doesn’t hit the high street and we leave the celebrities to it, as this trend is definitely not for ""real people"" as we say in the Industry.' Famous fans: Even the usually demure Miranda Kerr, left, has experimented with the flesh-baring trend while Miley Cyrus, right, is never one to shy away from flashing some skin . Hitting the high street: The trend is seeping into stores, with this £65 fishnet dress by Ashish for Topshop bound to cause a stir .

"By . Chris Waugh . England captain Steven Gerrard was prevented from playing his own game due to the defensive efforts of forward Edinson Cavani, according to Uruguay coach Oscar Tabarez. Roy Hodgson's men succumbed to a 2-1 defeat at the hands of La Celeste thanks to a Luis Suarez brace to leave them on the brink of elimination from Group D at the World Cup. And Tabarez is convinced that Cavani's display was 'key' to Uruguay's victory over 'a wonderful team' as he shutdown the supply line which England talisman Gerrard usually provides. Devastated: Steven Gerrard (right) cuts a forlorn figure after England lost 2-1 to Uruguay . Key: Uruguay coach Oscar Tabarez says Edinson Cavani's (left) defensive effort stifled Gerrard (right) Competitive: Cavani (centre) worked tirelessly for Uruguay and helped them to victory over England . Tabarez said: 'England doesn’t have weaknesses, they are very strong, have incredible midfield and have four strikers who are all goalscorers. 'But we played very well and Cavani played a very important role to counter that. Gerrard couldn’t play his game because Cavani was stopping him, so today they had more difficulties than normal. 'I think that was the key to the game. England are a wonderful team and are dangerous opponents, that’s why we’re so pleased to have won.' Uruguay were dreadful in their first match and surprisingly lost 3-1 to Costa Rica, but Tabarez saw a vast important from his side against England. The 67-year-old coach was also delighted that his team finally ended their 15-match winless record against European sides, but insists his team still have work to do to qualify for the last-16. He said: 'If this was a movie, people probably couldn’t have wished for a better result. Celebrate: Cavani runs over to celebrate with Luis Suarez, who scored both Uruguay goals . Deflated: Suarez runs off to the corner to celebrate his second goal while Gerrard holds his hips . 'We have been able to beat a European team after a long, long time. Many people said we wouldn’t be able to do so. 'Both goals were scored by Luis Suarez, a player who was injured a month ago and had to go through surgery. 'We are not qualified yet for the next stage. However, we are happy we get some fresh air.' The Uruguay coach was unsurprisingly full of praise for two-goal hero Suarez. Tabarez said of the Liverpool striker: ‘In Uruguay the law says that if you've been in hospital, you need to leave the hospital in a wheelchair. But he could walk weeks ago, otherwise he couldn't have played today. 'His team-mates really love him. We all love him. He's a wonderful person and a very important player for our team. We admire him. 'We're very proud and happy having him here, and happy for his wife as well who has been with him all the time.

"By . Tamara Cohen . Astonishing outburst: Sir Stephen Bubb, head of the Association of Chief Executives of Voluntary Organisations, called the issue a 'disgraceful distraction' Pressure was growing on charity bosses last night after it was revealed at least 30 were enjoying salaries of more than £100,000 a year. International Development Secretary Justine Greening said the finances of major aid organisations – which receive hundreds of millions of pounds from taxpayers – must be open to scrutiny. But as the head of the Charity Commission said the deals ‘risk bringing the charitable world into disrepute’, one aid boss insisted donors ‘don’t mind’ funding executives’ six-figure salaries. In an astonishing outburst, Sir Stephen Bubb said raising the issue was a ‘disgraceful distraction’. He . claimed their high salaries would not put people off giving saying: . ‘This simply isn’t an issue for donors. They are more concerned about . the outcomes, the performance and the efficiency of these . organisations.’ Sir . Stephen, head of the Association of Chief Executives of Voluntary . Organisations, whose own salary is believed to be more than £100,000, . added: ‘To keep talent, really strong people, at the top of these . organisations, they need to be paid properly. ‘These . are still not excessive salaries when you compare them to the public . and private sectors. It’s essential that the sector attracts skilled and . experienced professionals, not keen amateurs.’ He . insisted top charity executives earned far less than the leaders of . councils, or their counterparts in the private sector, and that the . average salary for a charity boss was £58,000. Writing . on his blog, he also accused right-wingers of hating charities. He . wrote: 'Many MPs on the right hate effective charities who campaign. 'They . particularly dislike international charities who have been so effective . in raising the concerns of the world's poor. So lets be robust in . defending pay.' Red Cross chief is top earner . Miss Greening said charities should disclose their pay packets and prove to supporters that their money is well spent. She . said the figures were a ‘clarion call for charities to be more open . about value for money’. ‘As government has, it is time for them to grasp . the nettle on transparency’, she said. Figures revealed that the highest paid charity boss included Justin Forsyth, a former Labour Party adviser who earns £163,000 as chief executive of Save the Children. British Red Cross chief executive Sir Nick Young, a former City lawyer earned £184,000 last year, while Dame Barbara Stocking of Oxfam took home £119,560 before stepping down this year. Six staff earn more than the Prime Minister’s £142,500 salary at the 14 charities which make up the Disasters Emergency Committee (DEC) – which brings together aid organisations to raise money quickly for the victims of natural disasters. Mounting pressure: International Development Secretary Justine Greening said the finances of major aid organisations - which receive hundreds of millions of pounds from taxpayers - must be open to scrutiny . These . charities rely on public funds, having received more than £1.1billion . over the past three years from the Government, the United Nations and . the EU. There are 186 staff . earning over £60,000 – a 16 per cent rise in three years, while the . number on six-figure salaries has risen from 22 in 2010 to 30 last year. Comic Relief, which is separate from the DEC, pays its chief executive . Kevil Cahill CBE a salary of £130,000 and has 21 members of staff on . more than £60,000. 'Taxpayers deserve to know how their money is being spent': Tory MP Priti Patel, who got the figures . William Shawcross, the chairman of . the Charity Commission, said: ‘It is not for the Commission to tell . charities how much they should pay their executives. 'However . in these difficult times, when many charities are experiencing . shortfalls, trustees should consider whether very high salaries are . really appropriate, and fair to both the donors and the taxpayers who . fund charities. 'Disproportionate salaries risk bringing organisations and the wider charitable world into disrepute.’ Tory . MP Priti Patel, who obtained the figures, said: ‘Hard-pressed taxpayers . deserve to know how their money is being spent and will be shocked to . see so many highly-paid executives in charities that are dependent on . public funds. 'This . money should be focused on delivering front-line services rather than . lining the pockets of unaccountable charity executives.’ At Save the Children, three staff earn more than £140,000. The highest is chief operating officer Annabel Hoult who earned £168,653 last year. A spokesman said: ‘To run an organisation that reaches ten million children in more than 50 countries, with thousands of staff, in some of the toughest places in the world takes real leadership, experience, knowledge and skill.’ Oxfam, whose chief executive’s salary has risen 19 per cent in three years, said it  was lower than other large charities. A spokesman added: ‘We believe this is a fair reward for a job that involved long hours and large amount of time away from family and overseeing a £360million organisation’. New boss Mark Goldring is responsible for 5,000 staff in its hundreds of charity shops and in the field in developing countries – of which 35 earn £60,000 or more. A Red Cross spokesman said Sir Nick’s salary, the highest of all the chief executives surveyed, reflected ‘the enormous responsibility the position carries’. At Age UK, the leading ageing charity of which Age International is a subsidiary, 11 earn six-figures and two earn between £180,000 and £190,000, although they do not work at the international arm of the charity. A spokesman said: ‘Age International’s priority is to ensure that the lives of vulnerable older people are improved as effectively as possible in 40 low and middle income countries and the trustees feel that it is important to ensure that we have the best people in place to achieve this.’","Astonishing outburst came as pressure grows on charity bosses .

"By . Tom Mctague, Mail Online Deputy Political Editor . A 'shambolic' overhaul of the Government's computer systems has left some departments in chaos and unable to work properly, it has emerged. Lib Dem Cabinet ministers Vince Cable and Ed Davey held crisis talks with David Cameron last week after staff at their departments were left struggling to cope. Mr Cable, the Business Secretary, is said to blame Tory ministers for forcing departments to slash costs and use small companies instead of tried-and-tested larger firms. Energy Secretary Ed Davey - pictured on the top of his department in Whitehall, has been accused of overseeing a 'shambolic' IT upgrade leaving his staff unable to send emails and get on the internet. The Energy Department's rooftop - where Mr Davey is pictured above - was used . for a scene in the James Bond film Skyfall . The Tories had demanded that smaller companies are given the chance to help bring Whitehall's creaking IT up to date. But this has left staff at the Business and Climate Change departments struggling with email problems and a dodgy internet connection since the new system was introduced in early May. Some have allegedly resorted to using their personal accounts, such as Hotmail or Gmail, to email messages and documents. Mr Cable is so concerned about the IT failures that he has urged other cabinet colleagues not to overhaul their IT systems until 'lessons could be learnt' from the fiasco. One official who has been left struggling to cope the new system told the Financial Times: 'Getting more SMEs in was an idealistic Tory policy in 2011 to shake up Whitehall. Business Secretary Vince Cable has told David Cameron about the problems his staff are facing after a botched IT upgrade. He is said to have warned other ministers not to touch their computer systems until 'lessons are learned' from the fiasco . 'But in effect they are not necessarily the best fit for this sort of task.' One source added that the IT overhaul had been 'shambolic'. Officials have allegedly been left struggling to cope with lost work, painfully slow internet connections and screen freezes. But one Whitehall official, who admitted the two departments had been suffering from 'transition issues', defended the upgrade. The official said: 'This looks, quite unfairly, like an attempt by DECC and BIS to shift blame for their own mistakes. All departments remain responsible for their own technology and service procurement.' The energy department said it had suffered some disruption from the new system but most people had been able to continue with their work. 'It’s a very bumpy ride for the last few weeks but everyone has worked through it and carried on delivering,' an official said. The business department said: 'Much progress has now been made. BIS and DECC were the first government departments to implement the Cabinet Office’s new ICT strategy and lessons learned will help other departments when they renew their IT in the future.' The Cabinet Office said: 'Civil servants need modern technology to do their jobs so we are replacing the expensive, inflexible and outdated contracts which we inherited in 2010. Our government IT reforms are saving taxpayers’ money and ensuring SMEs can compete alongside bigger providers.'","Vince Cable has allegedly warned David Cameron about Whitehall chaos .

"By . Katie Nicholl . and Jonathan Petre . The Queen has risked an international outcry by inviting the King of Bahrain to a Diamond Jubilee banquet despite widespread criticism of his bloody and repressive regime. The English-educated Sheikh Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa is on the guest list for a lunch hosted by the Queen in May at Windsor Castle. He is also thought to be among those invited to a champagne dinner given by Prince Charles the same evening at Buckingham Palace. The invitations will infuriate human rights campaigners and MPs angry at the Gulf state’s violent crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrations. Royal guest: The Queen receives the King of Bahrain at Buckingham Palace in 2004 . The country’s despotic rulers were accused of using brute force and torture to crush the protests last year, which saw more than 50 civilians killed and thousands arrested. The Bahrain royal family has direct control of the police, army and security services. The king’s son, the Crown Prince of Bahrain, was last year invited to the  wedding of Prince William and Kate Middleton but pulled out at the last minute in a move that spared the couple from potential embarrassment. Human rights activists had threatened to disrupt Prince Salman bin Hamad Al Khalifa’s stay in London, insisting he was the chief architect of the crackdown. In January, the Countess of Wessex came under pressure to return lavish jewels given to her by the Bahrain royal family during a pre-Christmas visit to the country. Despot: The English-educated King of Bahrain, Hamad bin Isa al Khalifa, leaves Number 10 Downing Street in December last year . One set of jewels came from the king and another from the prime minister, Sheikh Khalifa bin Salman Al Khalifa, the king’s uncle. The crown prince gave her a silver and pearl cup and her husband, the Earl of Wessex, received a silk rug. Continuing unrest on the streets of Bahrain has also led to calls for this month’s Formula 1 race there to be cancelled, with critics including ex-world champion Damon Hill. One protester was shot dead last week when riot police used tear gas and live bullets against demonstrators. Buckingham Palace aides said yesterday that the King of Bahrain had not yet confirmed that he will attend the Diamond Jubilee lunch, which will take place at Windsor on May 18 and which will be a historic and intimate gathering of crowned heads. During the Golden Jubilee the Queen hosted a party for the sovereigns of Europe, but this is a much wider gathering of reigning monarchs from around the world. Palace aides said the luncheon would tie in with the ‘Big Lunch’ theme of the Jubilee celebrations which encourages the British public to organise street meals around the country to celebrate. Prince Charles has organised a dinner on the same evening at Buckingham Palace as a personal ‘thank you’ to his mother, who will celebrate her 60 years on the Throne with a weekend of celebrations in June. While the Prince’s dinner is expected to be an elaborate affair, and is likely to be organised by his former valet Michael Fawcett, who now runs a catering business, the Queen’s lunch will be catered ‘in house’ and may be staged in the  gardens of Windsor Castle. Aides said it was the Queen’s idea to host the lunch and she was ‘delighted’ when Prince Charles offered to throw a dinner. It is understood that the reigning heads of Spain, Denmark, Sweden, Andorra, Belgium, Luxembourg, Monaco, the Netherlands and Norway will all attend the lunch. Crowned heads from further afield are expected to include the Emperor of Japan, the King of Tonga and rulers from the Middle Eastern kingdoms including President Khalifa bin Zayed of the United Arab Emirates, the Sultan of Brunei, Sheikh Ahmad Hmoud Al-Sabah of Kuwait and the Emir of Qatar. Crackdown: Bahraini riot police take cover from petrol bombs hurled by protesters during clashes in Sanabis village, near Manama, after they broke up a march in support of a jailed human rights activist on Wednesday . Dissent: Graffiti in Barbar, Bahrain, depicts the King in a race car, calling for a boycott of this year's Formula 1 Bahrain Grand Prix, scheduled for April 22 . Bloodied: Protesters carry an injured man during a clash with police in the suburbs of Manama last month. The King of Bahrain declared a state of emergency for three months to deal with unrest which swept the country . It is believed the elderly King of Saudi Arabia, King Abdullah bin Abdulaziz, has declined  the invitation but is sending the crown prince in his place. The Saudi Arabian royal family has also been criticised for human-rights abuses, as has another invitee, the King of Swaziland, Mswati III, Africa’s last absolute monarch. A Palace source told The Mail on Sunday: ‘It was the Queen’s decision to host the lunch and her decision to invite every world sovereign. It would have been very rude to have left anyone off the list and the Queen would never want to offend anyone.’ The source added: ‘Charles can’t make the Queen’s luncheon as he and Camilla are on official engagements, but he will be hosting the evening celebrations and he is sparing no expense on the meal, which will all be organic, and the champagne, which will flow all night.’ Bahrain has been battling to restore its international reputation since last year’s violent clashes between security forces and anti-government demonstrators. Trading gifts: Prince Charles is presented with an ornate sword by the King of Bahrain during a tour of the gulf in 2007. The two will meet again when the Prince hosts a champagne dinner at Buckingham Palace in May . In February 2011, 35 people were killed and hundreds wounded in Pearl Square in Bahrain’s capital Manama when security forces used rubber bullets, tear gas, batons and then live ammunition to disperse protesters. Inspired by revolutions in Egypt and Tunisia, thousands of demonstrators took to the streets demanding greater freedom and democratic reforms. Protesters wanted political prisoners released, more jobs and housing and the removal of the prime minister, who has been in office for 40 years. Tensions between the country’s Sunni elite and the less affluent Shia majority have intensified since Bahrain’s independence from  the UK in 1971. Shia groups say they are marginalised, repressed and subjected to unfair laws. According to reports, since February 2011 scores of demonstrators have been killed and hundreds tortured, while thousands have been dismissed or suspended from their jobs. Cosy: David Cameron meets the King of Bahrain at 10 Downing Street in December last year. The Coalition is said to have authorised the sale of £2.2million worth of arms to the oppressive Bahraini regime last summer . At the height of the killings, David Cameron greeted the crown prince at No 10, and between July and September 2011 the Coalition reportedly authorised the sale of £2.2million of arms to the regime. Bahrain’s rulers have promised  to introduce reforms to increase democracy, but campaigners say they have yet to implement them. Buckingham Palace refused to comment on the guest list last night. A spokesman said: ‘We can’t confirm who has been invited or who has accepted.’ A spokesman for Prince Charles said: ‘We can’t comment on the dinner or any of the guests who may or may not have been invited because we haven’t announced anything yet.’","Sheikh Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa's regime is accused of killing and torturing civilians during last year's pro-democracy demonstrations .

"By . Tom Mctague, Mail Online Deputy Political Editor . One of Ed Miliband's key advisers has quit the party - to join the Liberal Democrats. Phil Taylor helped mastermind Mr Miliband’s victory over his brother David in their battle for the Labour leadership. But Mr Taylor has lashed out at the 'really weak' Labour leader and defected to Nick Clegg’s party. He attacked Mr Miliband's policies on the economy, Europe and attempt to look tough on knife crime. Mr Taylor has also mocked Mr Miliband over recent gaffes - including his now infamous struggle with a bacon sandwich. Ed Miliband has seen his poll ratings slump below Nick Clegg's. The defection of Phil Taylor (right) is a fresh blow . Mr Taylor was the Labour leader's speech writer during the leadership contest against his brother David. According to the Mirror, Mr Taylor even stayed over at Mr Miliband's north London home. Mr Taylor is a long-term Labour supporter and served as a special adviser to Peter Hain when the veteran Labour MP held a string of Cabinet jobs. He remained a shadow Cabinet political adviser after leaving Mr Miliband’s office was still on the party payroll until three months ago. But he has turned against the Labour and joined the Lib Dems a month ago after praising Nick Clegg for taking on UKIP leader Nigel Farage in TV European election debates. He attacked Labour’s addiction to spending, saying: 'Labour’s view still that absolutely anything with label ""capital"" slapped on must be so economically beneficial it justifies more borrowing.' Mr Taylor also lashed out at Labour's decision to support Tory plans to automatically jail people caught carrying a knife for a second time. He said: 'No chance Ed M actually believes this nonsense in private, but terrified of ‘soft on crime’ label - really weak.' Mr Taylor and the Labour party have refused to comment. The revelation that Mr Taylor has jumped ship comes amid a series of dire polls for the Labour leader. Mr Miliband was widely ridiculed after unflattering pictures of him eating a bacon sandwich appeared online. One of his former aides Phil Taylor, who has left the party to join the Lib Dems, retweeted a doctored image of the picture on his Twitter account. He also accused him of being 'really weak' Former Business Secretary Peter Mandelson - a key ally of Tony Blair and Gordon Brown - even refused to endorse him as Labour’s best choice for leader in a TV interview. The Labour peer said: 'I think that he has confused the party’s message on business.' Mr Miliband has hit back at the growing criticism of his leadership and vowed to beat the 'historical odds' he faces trying to win the next election just five years after Labour were kicked out of power. He also insisted he was confident that Labour would emerge from next year's election as the largest party. He said: 'We are in a position to defy those odds.' Mr Miliband said: 'Millions of people feel that no political party speaks for them. That’s what I’m determined to turn around.'","Phil Taylor helped mastermind Mr Miliband’s victory over his brother David .

"By . Kieran Corcoran . Pumped-up: Motorists are losing out on £1.5million a day as a result of wholesale savings not being passed on, the AA said . Diesel car drivers are being hit by inflated prices to line the pockets of fuel suppliers and petrol stations, according to a new study. Across the UK, motorists are losing out on almost £1.5million every day because of increased margins which do not pass on lower diesel wholesale prices, researchers found. According to the AA, the ten million drivers of diesel vehicles pay around 3p per litre more than they would if the savings were passed on. The study found that the average price for a litre of diesel is 5.32p higher than that of petrol - despite the fact that diesel bought wholesale is only 0.8p more expensive. A monthly fuel price report revealed that the average UK price for a litre of petrol is 130.47p, and for diesel it is 135.70p. Other countries in Europe have passed on the savings, leaving French, German and Spanish drivers paying proportionately less than Britons. In France diesel is actually cheaper than petrol by 0.4 per cent, while in Spain it is 2 per cent more expensive and in Germany 7 per cent. The average figure for UK forecourts is 11 per cent. The motoring organisation also pointed out that the higher prices are keeping prices in the shops high, as many haulage and delivery firms are passing on higher transport prices to their customers. Analysis of average prices by the AA said that the differences allowed UK sellers to make much higher profits from diesel drivers. It suggests that over the past three months suppliers and retailers make 8.2p profit for every litre of diesel sold, compared to 4.98p on petrol. Edmung King, the AA's president, said: 'The pumped-up price of diesel so far this summer is hitting 35 per cent of UK car owners and is inexcusable. Neighbouring European countries have passed on the benefit of lower diesel wholesale costs to their drivers.' Profits: The graph above shows the margins fuel companies can make on a litre of each fuel. While petrol margins have fallen in recent months, the figures for diesel have crept upwards .

"By . James Rush . Bryan Greenhalgh, 63, was handed a discretionary life term after admitting 13 charges of indecent assault and one serious sexual assault . A former headmaster has been jailed for a string of sex attacks on eight vulnerable boys at two boarding schools over a ten year period dating back to the 1970s. Bryan Greenhalgh, 63, was handed a discretionary life term after admitting 13 charges of indecent assault and one serious sexual assault. He was told he had to spend at least three years behind bars, and would only be freed if he was rated as low risk, after being branded 'dangerous' by a judge. Greenhalgh, of Suffield, near North Walsham, Norfolk, was jailed at Norwich Crown Court as one of his old colleagues, Ken Wells, was also sent to jail for historic sex offences. Greenhalgh carried out the attacks on boys, all aged under 16, at Sheringham Court School, Norfolk, and Thurlby Manor, Lincolnshire. He was also sentenced for possessing indecent images found on his home computer after it was seized by police. Andrew Shaw, defending, said Greenhalgh deserved credit for his guilty plea. Mr Shaw told the court: 'Any sentence should not be so long as to give him no hope of release to enjoy the twilight years of his life. He does not enjoy the best of health.' Judge Nicholas Coleman labelled Greenhalgh 'a very high risk sex offender.' He said: 'You cannot understand the untold harm you have done to these boys as they have gone into adulthood. 'It’s clear they have suffered severe psychological harm. You are a dangerous person.' Greenhalgh was jailed at Norwich Crown Court (pictured) as one of his old colleagues, Ken Wells, was also sent to jail for historic sex offences . Wells, 76, of Leicester, was convicted yesterday of three counts of indecent assault following an eight-day trial at Norwich Crown Court. The housefather abused a boy aged under 16 at Sheringham Court School in the 1970s. Jailing Wells for six years, Judge Catherine Moore told him: 'You exploited the opportunity to satisfy your own sexual gratification - your duty was to protect the children at the school. 'Your victim has been profoundly affected in his life.' Wells, 76, of Leicester, was convicted yesterday of three counts of indecent assault following an eight-day trial at Norwich Crown Court . Last night investigating officer, Detective Constable Tristan Coull, of Norfolk Police child abuse investigation unit, said: 'Greenhalgh’s life sentence clearly shows that he exploited his position as headmaster to win over the trust of the boys in his care and subjected them to horrendous abuse. 'He preyed on boys who were at their most vulnerable and who at the time of the abuse felt unable to speak out as he appeared to be an upstanding pillar of the community. 'Wells in addition abused his position of trust at Sheringham Court and failed in his duty to ensure his victim was safe. 'Through the positions they held, it would have been the most basic of expectations to protect these children - instead they chose to do the complete opposite.' Detective Inspector Andy Coller, who led the complex inquiry, praised the victims for being brave enough to come forward. He said: 'It has taken an enormous amount of courage for each victim to talk about the abuse, abuse they have had to live with for decades. 'It is pleasing that the passing of some 40 years has not hindered the legal process and that Greenhalgh and Wells have both been jailed for these crimes. 'Time may make our investigations more complicated, but it will not stop them. 'We will robustly investigate any offences brought to our attention, however old they may be. 'It is to their credit that those boys, now men, have found the strength to speak up after so many years.'","Bryan Greenhalgh handed discretionary life term at Norwich Crown Court .

"By . Sean Poulter . Motorway service stations are known to charge over the odds for fast food, safe in the knowledge that they are the only option for hungry drivers. But it’s not just burgers for which you pay more on a long car journey, according to a survey. A single banana can cost as much as 75p at a service station  – more than six times the supermarket price of around 12p. The Norton Canes service station on the M6 in Staffordshire, where a survey found a banana cost 75p . The price of a banana at Norton Canes Roachef is six times as much the supermarket price of a single banana, which is around 12p . The Which? survey found the cost of a banana at motorway shops ranged from 50p at the M40’s Cherwell Valley Moto near Oxford, to 75p at the Norton Canes Roadchef on the M6 toll in Staffordshire. Other items with a heavy mark-up included a bottle of water costing £1.59 at Fleet Welcome Break on the M3 in Hampshire. Similar bottles in supermarkets cost between 27p and 38p. The most expensive cheese sandwich was also at Fleet, costing £3.75, while its supermarket equivalent was priced at just 85p. The survey also revealed the nation's best and worst motorway service stations, which reveal stark differences in the quality of food and facilities at 26 of the country's biggest rest stops. Tebay, off the M6 in Cumbria, has been confirmed as the nation’s favourite, winning praise for its fresh local meat and produce, its hearty food and its spotless toilets. A banana at Cherwell Valley services on the M40 in Oxford only costs 50p, 25p cheaper than at Norton Canes, according to research from Which? Run by a family owned company, it was opened by Prince Charles in 1972 and could not be further from the big chains which pepper the nation’s motorways with their plastic fast food, high prices and grim loos. Such is the quality of its produce, pies, cheeses and locally prepared food that it has been described as the Harrods Food Hall of the north, finding fame as a tourist destination in itself. No burgers and plastic wrapped sandwiches for Tebay, rather traditional favourites such as hot pot and steak-and-kidney pie. Compare that with Charnock Richard, just 64 miles south down the M6, which is named as the worst of the roadside service stations, a brutal concrete legacy of the 1960s where the food options include Burger King, KFC, Starbucks, Krispy Kreme, and Subway. Owned by the Welcome Break group, it managed a customer score of just 39 per cent, which compares to the 90 per cent for Tebay. Other items with a heavy mark-up included a bottle of water costing £1.59 at Fleet Welcome Break on the M3 in Hampshire, pictured . Tebay is the creation of John and Barbara Dunning who faced the nightmare news 45 years ago that the new M6 would rip through their peaceful Cumbrian cattle farm. Rather than simply giving in to the march of progress, they chose to work with the developers and opened their own motorway service station. Today its farm shop stocks products from over 70 local suppliers and many others from the neighbouring counties. There are two butchery counters, which sell meat direct from the family farm, while there is a broad range of pies, everything from duck, plum and Armagnac to steak and kidney. Visitors can order food up to 24 hours in advance, with many travellers choosing to stock up on farmhouse cheeses, charcuterie and a surprisingly large range of scotch eggs. Award-winning bread is also available. In May this year, the family opened a second service station off the northbound carriageway of the M5 at Gloucester, while they recently secured funding of £27million to do the same on the southbound. The template for Tebay has been reproduced at the new site with a farm shop that stocks products from 130 suppliers in the immediate 30-mile radius. A Which? spokesman said: ‘The family-run business is slightly different from usual service stations as it sells home-grown and local produce in its farm shop and restaurant. ‘It was the only location to get a full five-star rating and it achieved this feat in both food quality and toilet cleanliness.’ The picturesque Tebay services on the M6 in Cumbria has been named the best in the country winning praise for its fresh local meat and produce . The reviews of Charnock Richard, which is less than a one hour drive away in Lancashire, are distinctly less glowing. It was the first service area to open on the M6 in 1963, and like other services from its time, the restaurant was located in a building on the concrete bridge which spanned the carriageway. Today customers at KFC and Burger King can amuse themselves with a bird’s eye view of the trucks, white vans and private cars that thunder along the road beneath their feet. Service station expert, Mark Goodge, of the website motorwayservices.info, said: ‘Charnock Richard is on a very busy part of the motorway, but it’s not the largest of motorway service areas (MSAs) and so tends to get excessively crowded. ‘And, like a lot of the Burger King and KFC franchises at MSAs, it tends to be under-staffed, which means long queues at peak times and lack of cleaning. ‘It was the first MSA to open on the M6 in July 1963, and it’s built to a design which was fashionable at the time but hasn’t kept pace with changes in usage patterns and customer demand since then. ‘Lots of piecemeal additions to it over the years mean that the building is cramped and awkward to navigate inside. The building is ugly, and although it’s in a mainly rural location it makes no use of that at all. Meanwhile Charnock Richard services on the M6 in Lancashire, which was the first of its kind to open in 1963, has been named the worst . ‘Instead, it’s screened off from the outside world by high hedges and fences all round. That, of course, is mainly to hide it from local residents, but it gives the entire site a claustrophobic feel.’ Mr Goodge said he had stayed at a motel on the site mainly to see if it is as bad as its reputation. ‘I have to say that I wouldn’t use it again unless I was desperate,’ he said. He praised Tebay saying it had ‘managed to avoid most of the perceived issues with corporate blandness that often applies to the main operators’. He added: ‘It’s also got some nice individual tweaks, like a farm shop on site, as well as a caravan site which is very useful for holidaymakers wanting an overnight stop on the way to Scotland. And it has the huge benefit of being located in a beautiful part of the countryside, which the operators have taken full advantage of in the design. ‘I’m not convinced that the food itself is hugely better - or cheaper - than anywhere else, however the overall ambience of the site is certainly a lot nicer than the typical motorway service station.

"By . Sean Poulter, Consumer Affairs Editor . Bank customers will soon be able to pay a cheque into an account by taking a picture of it on their mobile phone . Bank customers will soon be allowed to pay a cheque into their account without having to visit a branch – by taking a picture of it with their mobile. A change in the law means customers will be able to email a picture of the cheque to their bank along with their account number and have the funds transferred without having to queue in their local branch. The system means cheques can be paid in . to accounts at any time of the day or night and, most importantly, the . funds are instantly available. Banks claim the service will make life easier for customers. More than 23million people receive cheques for their birthday every year, while 60 per cent of charity donations are made by cheque, as is one in four payments to small businesses. The Government is expected to support the change, and an announcement from Chancellor George Osborne could come as soon as Monday. The banks are keen on the system as it will cut costs. Barclays has been running a trial using its banking app on iPhones, while the system has been running in the US for five years. A Barclays spokesman said: ‘The current cheque legislation dates from 1882, which is the year Charles Darwin died, and is clearly not fit for the digital age.’ Overseas financial institutions have been . using smartphone cheque deposit systems since 2009, including Bank of . America, Chase, Citigroup, ING, Paypal in the USA, Banco Sabadell in . Spain and ING Direct in Canada. The firm behind the technology, . Intelligent Environments, says its research found three in four Britons . would like the option of using the ‘photocheque’ system. The company claims the regime is a natural extension of the fact that an increasing number of people are using laptops, tablets and smartphones for their banking. Banks claim the service will make life easier for customers and will . also help cut costs. They say the current system for banking cheques is . outdated . Managing director at Intelligent Environments, David Webber, said: ‘It is nonsense that British consumers aren’t allowed to snap a photo of their cheques and instantly deposit them using a smartphone. ‘In this connected age with almost two-thirds of the population using smartphones, mobile cheque deposits could save the UK millions of wasted hours and thousands of pounds on stamps. ‘The major banks are on a drive to introduce technology to make their customers lives as easy as possible and I’m sure they would introduce this tomorrow, if the Treasury let them. ‘It’s madness that Britain is still lagging behind due to out of touch regulation.’ In the US, a new Federal law known as Check 21, was passed to allow digital images of cheques to be accepted by the banks. A similar law would be required in this country. Earlier this year, the nation’s biggest banks signed up to the new ‘Paym’ system, which allows payments to be made to individuals and businesses based on their mobile phone number rather than account details. Users simply tap in the number of the person to receive the money to authorise an electronic transfer from one account to another. The idea is that millions of people will have their mobile phone number tied to their bank account – as a substitute for the normal account number and sort code. Access to the Paym system will be covered by password or code protection in an attempt to avoid the risk of the phone being stolen and used to raid customers’ accounts.","Announcement about new law could come from Government on Monday .

"By . Paul Donnelley . Walking down Regent Street in central London, shoppers spotted an unusual sight before them. Used to the dirt and grime of the city, the shiny bright red seats at the bus shelter and the unusual look of the bus stop for some reason brought back memories of childhood. It was only when they got close up, that they realised that the bus stop and the bus shelter near Hamleys on Regent Street were made from 100,000 Lego bricks. Mouths fell open as the passengers and passers-by gawped at the iconic children's toy made into an adult structure.

This disappointing rate of growth is underlined by an even slower rise in total wealth, taking the figure from $7.5trillion in 2012 to $7.6trillion last year.

"By . James Rush . Bosses at Coronation Street are reportedly planning a new storyline in which Faye Windass (pictured) falls pregnant . Coronation Street bosses are planning a new storyline in which a schoolgirl will learn she is pregnant at the age of 12. The ITV soap is understood to be developing the new plot in which Faye Windass, played by Ellie Leach, 13, falls pregnant, for later this year. She is expected to become the youngest ever mother on the show, which previously featured Sarah-Louise Platt, played by Tina O'Brien, discovering she was pregnant at the age of 13 in 2000, according to The Sun. Norman Wells, of the Family Education Trust, has warned scriptwriters needed to 'take great care' when dealing with such topics. He said: 'One of the problems of giving prominence in a soap to life experiences that are extremely rare is that it can distort people's perception of reality and give the impression that such experiences are far more common than they really are. 'In spite of the fact that teenage pregnancy rates in the UK are high compared with many other parts of Western Europe, they are still thankfully rare - and pregnancies in 12 year-old girls are much, much rarer still. 'Scriptwriters and production companies need to take great care that in their desperation to attract high viewer ratings they do not normalise behaviour that is both illegal and damaging to impressionable children.' A Coronation Street source has told The . Sun: 'This is bound to be a controversial storyline but the programme . has a history of handling difficult subject matters in a sensitive and . considerate way.' The show has previously featured Sarah-Louise Platt, played by Tina O'Brien, discovering she was pregnant at the age of 13 in 2000 . The character of Faye Windass was introduced to the show in 2011 as the adopted daughter of Anna Windass. She was involved in a controversial storyline in 2012 when the soap sparked a storm of protest from viewers with an episode which showed the schoolgirl being smacked. Hundreds took to web forums and Twitter to express outrage at the scene which featured Faye being hit by her adoptive mother’s boyfriend Owen Armstrong. The builder, played by Ian Puleston-Davies, loses his temper in the scene after the then ten-year-old schoolgirl deliberately poisons the  fish in his pond. He is seen whacking Faye on the back of the legs as she winces in pain. Faye Windass, played by Ellie Leach, is expected to become the youngest ever mother on the show . In February MailOnline reported how teenage pregnancy rates had fallen to their lowest levels since the 1960s. Figures released by the Office for National Statistics showed that conceptions among under-18s dropped by 10 per cent in 2012. Reasons for the sudden decrease in pregnancies include more girls staying in further education and the growing ‘stigma’ of teenage motherhood, officials said. In April it was reported a 12-year-old girl and a 13-year-old boy were believed to have become Britain's youngest parents after she give birth to a 7lb 4oz baby girl. At 12 years and three months, she was five months younger than the previous youngest UK mother. HAYLEY CROPPER'S SUICIDE . The soap prompted a national debate on assisted suicide with the controversial plotline which saw terminally ill character Hayley Cropper (played by Julie Hesmondhalgh) end her life. The episode attracted an extra two million viewers, prompting accusations the storyline was simply staged to boost ratings. Before it was even broadcast, the story had sparked much debate on assisted suicide, even though Miss Cropper was shown ending her own life without the help from her husband Roy (pictured below). The emotional scenes were watched by a peak audience of 10.6million. Some said ITV had stoked up the controversy in a deliberate attempt to boost its viewing figures, although the broadcaster did not mention assisted suicide in its official press releases. Despite the criticism, others praised ITV for its sensitive handling of the tragic storyline. Coronation Street prompted a national debate on assisted suicide with the controversial plotline which saw terminally ill character Hayley Cropper (played by Julie Hesmondhalgh) end her life . TONY GORDON GUN SIEGE . In June 2010, ITV chiefs were due to show a run of episodes which featured convicted killer Tony Gordon (played by Gary O'Brien) embarking on a terrifying gun siege in Weatherfield after escaping from prison. During five post-watershed episodes planned for the week, viewers were due to see at least one character die as Tony made it clear he intended to kill his ex-wife Carla (played by Alison King) and Hayley Cropper. Halfway through the storyline however, on June 2, real-life gunman Derrick Bird killed 12 people and injured 11 others before shooting himself. As a mark of respect, the programme rescheduled the rest of the episodes. DEIRDRE RACHID JAILED . In 1998 Free The Weatherfield One became a national phenomenon after Deirdre Rachid (played by Anne Kirkbride) was jailed for mortgage and credit card fraud while her lover Jon Lindsay walked free. The campaign, led by newspapers, petitioned Home Secretary Jack Straw to become involved on the character's behalf. Thousands of viewers were left outraged at what was perceived to be a gross miscarriage of justice, and even the Prime Minister Tony Blair joined in, announcing he would order the Home Secretary to investigate. Deridre (pictured right) was released after three weeks in prison. SARAH-LOUISE PLATT TEENAGE PREGNANCY . In February 2000, Sarah-Louise Platt (played by Tina O'Brien) discovered she was five months pregnant soon after her 13th birthday. Her baby daughter Bethany was born four months later. Despite coming under some criticism that the storyline would glamourise teenage pregnancy, the programme makers were praised by the government for its handling of the subject.","ITV soap planning new plot in which Faye Windass, 12, falls pregnant .

"By . Kieran Corcoran . This is the moment former N-Dubz singer Dappy slapped a man in the face for calling him a 'mug'. The 27-year-old pop star - real name is Dino Costas Contostavlos - can be seen lashing out at clubber George Chittock on the dancefloor at the Chicago Rock Café in Chelmsford, Essex. He lashed out at Mr Chittock on February 27 this year, and says the man called him names. Assault: Dappy, pictured centre wearing a baseball cap, can be seen bringing his hand across the face of George Chittock in an Essex club . Recoil: Mr Chittock can be seen in the above pictured recoiling from the blow. Dappy was today ordered to pay an £800 because of the fight . In an assault trial at Chelmsford Magistrates' Court which ended today he called the trial a 'stitch-up' - but was found guilty and ordered to pay an £800 fine. Dappy held his head in his hands today he was found guilty of assault by beating. Closing the prosecution case today, Jacqueline Carey told the court: 'Whether Mr Chittock called this defendant a mug is neither here nor there. 'You may think what he is really saying is that he was provoked - provocation is no defence. 'It is no defence for anybody, celebrity or otherwise, to say ""I lashed out because he was rude to me"". 'It is not reasonable to slap somebody when surrounded by bodyguards because somebody says to you ""Oi, what?"".' Ms Carey told the court the pair were in a smoking area along with Contostavlos’s minder and two of the club’s own door staff at about 2am when he was seen to slap Mr Chittock. The incident was caught on CCTV. Witnesses claimed Contostavlos had consumed half of bottle of vodka that night. 'A stitch-up': Former N-Dubz singer Dappy, pictured at court today with his minder, claimed he hit out in self-defence . Chair of the bench Angela Tucker said the magistrates had found Contostavlos was not under any physical threat at the time of the incident. There was . no sign of his friend and fellow Celebrity Big Brother housemate Jim . Davidson, who arrived at court yesterday in a show of moral support. Davidson claimed he had offered his services as a character witness but the defence team declined. The court was read details of Contostavlos's criminal record, including a six-month suspended sentence for affray and assault in February 2012. A trial last year heard how he spat at Grace Cochran and Serena Burton, who were both 19, at a filling station in Guildford. Mitigating today, Mr Harrison said: 'It was no doubt a regrettable incident but one that was over very quickly and left a person red-faced and very, very angry. 'He is a polarising figure who is clearly liked by a great many people but he is equally disliked by many others.' Referring to his client's ability to pay a fine or compensation, he said his client is well paid but his earnings are sporadic and he is currently awaiting a five-figure payment. But he added that Contostavlos's finances were limited by a recent tax settlement. Magistrates retired to consider sentencing. Earlier in the trial Jon Harrison, defending, said: 'The real question in this trial is can you be sure that when the defendant turned round that he did not believe he may be attacked? 'In that split second, is there really time to draw the attention of security officers? 'This is a man who regularly makes public appearances and is surrounded by people. 'He’s not somebody who believes every single person wants to do him harm.' 'Assault': George Chittock, left, leave Chelsmford Magistrates' Court after giving evidence. Jim Davidson, right, was seen at court yesterday supporting Dappy, with whom he appeared on Celebrity Big Brother . Scene: The assault took place at Chicago Rock Cafe in Chelmsford, Essex . In a police statement read to the court, the performer said he had been 'cut' in an incident four or five years earlier at a nightclub in Nottingham. Asked if he feared he was going to be stabbed on the night of the incident, he added: 'Yeah of course, I’m always concerned about that. 'I was scared someone was going to put a hole in me.' During cross-examination, the performer said he was 'a million per cent' sure that it was Mr Chittock who called him a 'mug'. 'It was a violation,' he said. 'Tesco, Asda, everywhere I go, there’s always one person to make a rude remark. This is a stitch-up. This is what’s happening in this case.' Dappy did not comment as he left court but made a hand gesture to fans before climbing into a black Audi with tinted windows and driving away. N-Dubz band members appear to have entered a downward spiral since they split up in September 2011, facing an array of legal, financial and professional problems. Dappy's conviction for assault today still leaves a host of claims and charges against N-Dubz members to be resolved in the courts. Fellow member and former X Factor judge Tulisa Contostavlos is currently awaiting the result of her own assault trial, in which she is accused of punching a gossip writer who used his website to publicise a sex tape of her. A hearing - also at Chelmsford Magistrates’ Court –  was told she boasted of being 'worth £10million' and said she  'knew gangsters and people from the streets' before launching a vicious attack on Savvas Morgan, 26. The case has been adjourned until July 2 while more witnesses are called. Mighty have fallen: Dappy, left, is pictured above with Tulisa, centre, and Fazer, while the group was still together in 2009 . Separately, she is waiting for the start of a drugs trial in London. She is charged with helping a Sun journalist obtain half an ounce (14.2g) of cocaine for £860. She will face the charges at a trial which begins at Southwark Crown Court on July 14. She had denied the charges previously, but has yet to enter a formal plea. Fazer, the third member, was declared bankrupt at the end of 2013. It later emerged that his girlfriend Ashley-Emma Havelin, with whom he as a young daughter, had turned to filming pornography to make ends meet. In January this year she was working for Studio 66, which hosts late-night phone-ins. But she defended her work, saying: ‘Glamour gets a bad rep, I don't get what the major issue is. I'm not a slag.’ It is not known how much the singer – real name Richard Rawson – owes HMRC. Dappy himself came close to bankruptcy this year – but escaped after paying £140,000 to HMRC in February. He has also experience professional trouble. Earlier this week he stormed off stage ten minutes early while performing at the Isle of Wight festival. The singer later complained of ‘low energy’ from his audience, who booed him after he turned up 15 minutes late for the start of the performance.","Pop star, 27, pictured at night club in Chelmsford Essex hitting a man .

"By . James Chapman, Daily Mail Political Editor . Incentive: Iain Duncan Smith has said unemployed Britons are starting to take jobs that would normally be filled by immigrant workers thanks to benefits reforms . Unemployed Britons are being made to take jobs currently filled chiefly by immigrant workers thanks to sweeping reforms of the benefits system, Iain Duncan Smith has said. The Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith said pilot schemes of the Government’s new universal credit – which is replacing six different out of work benefits and tax credits – suggested claimants are increasingly moving into seasonal, short-term or part-time work. Employers have long found people on benefits unwilling to accept such jobs, since they risk losing tax credits, housing benefit or other handouts for positions that may not be secure, and turned to foreign workers. But Mr Duncan Smith said universal credit, which guarantees that claimants are always better off working, even part-time, was creating a new market in ‘mini-jobs’ for the British unemployed. ‘Under universal credit, there is always an incentive to do more hours,’ the Work and Pensions Secretary said. ‘It makes it more viable to employ a British citizen. They are more flexible than they ever would have been before. Employers don’t need to get somebody from somewhere else.’ Mr Duncan Smith revealed that as universal credit is rolled out across the country, he plans to impose new conditions on those working part-time to push them to do more. He is planning an extension of sanctions that will affect people currently claiming tax credits and other benefits which see the state top up income. In-work claimants will be challenged to take on more hours or face a sliding scale of cuts to their income. ‘The single most important thing are the in-work allowances in universal credit. At the moment, the adviser stops seeing you the moment you get into work because you just go into the tax credit system,’ Mr Duncan Smith said. ‘Now the adviser will stay with you until you break free of the benefits system altogether. We will be introducing in-work conditionality. There will be a certain point where somebody who has been doing part-time work, we can say “we think in your circumstances you could do at least another five hours a week, let’s find that”.’ Mr Duncan Smith was speaking to the Daily Mail as he prepared to announce the latest phase of universal credit, which is the biggest change to social security since 1945. Scheme: Mr Duncan Smith said universal credit, which guarantees claimants are better off working, was creating a new market in 'mini-jobs' for the unemployed . The service, which is already available in ten pilot areas across England, Scotland and Wales, is to be rolled out across the first entire region, the North West of England, from Monday. In total 90 jobcentres, or one in eight in Britain, will offer the new benefit. Mr Duncan Smith has designed the new system chiefly so that claimants will benefit from better work incentives. People are able to move in and out of work more smoothly, he says, and jobcentres get instant access to HMRC earnings data so they can make sure people are receiving the right amount of support and eliminate fraud. Claimants have to sign a new commitment which sets out what is expected of them in return for payments, and sanctions – including withdrawal of universal credit – that will be introduced if they fall short. ‘It’s a claimant commitment – a kind of contract. It looks at an individual, requires them to have a CV, be available, attend interviews, take a job if it’s offered, and if you don’t do that this is what will happen,’ Mr Duncan Smith said. ‘For the first time ever, it’s like a contract of work. We are already seeing a significant change of attitude. It focuses the mind, it makes people think about work. ‘By simplifying the mess of benefits and tax credits we inherited, and by improving work incentives, we are ending the something-for-nothing culture. ‘For too long, jobseeker's allowance and tax credits stopped acting as a way of supporting people to get into work and rebuilding their lives in bad times. Instead benefits became a trap. ‘It’s morally right that we break this trap and we take action against a culture of entrenched dependency. We must stop a benefits system that only reinforces hardship. ‘It is absurd that a situation could exist where a lone parent or low paid worker had to think twice about accepting more hours at work because the increase in wages would be minimal. The state was providing a very real disincentive to work. ‘Universal credit is about fundamentally changing the relationship between claimants and the state. We are seeing claimants spending more time looking for jobs and moving smoothly into employment safe in the knowledge that it will always pay more to be in work.’ Mr Duncan Smith dismissed Labour criticism of the scheme, which it supports in principle but has been dogged with IT design faults, leading to successive delays. ‘We’ve changed the way anyone will ever roll out a big IT regime again. Yes, it’s a bit slower, but it’s a damn sight safer,’ Mr Duncan Smith said.","Iain Duncan Smith says Brits now taking jobs normally filled by immigrants .

"By . Chris Foy . Follow @@FoyChris . England are confident Joe Launchbury will be galvanised by the shock of being initially dropped for the third Test against New Zealand on Saturday to make light of the late withdrawal of Geoff Parling. The tourists were forced into a late reshuffle by the loss of Parling, who was unable to shake off a hamstring strain which has hampered him this week. The Leicester lock was identified by head coach Stuart Lancaster as the team’s leading forward in the first two Tests and Andy Farrell conceded that his absence will be keenly felt. Passing muster: Joe Launchbury (second left), in training in Hamilton, will replace Geoff Parling in the pack . In the running: Launchbury (centre) sprints during England's training session in Hamilton . VIDEO Lancaster explains seven third-Test changes . ‘He's been in great form and leading very well from the front as far as the forward pack is concerned,’ Farrell said. ‘He was struggling at the beginning of the week and did everything he possibly could to get right, but he isn't right to play at Test match intensity. 'It's a big loss for us but we have good cover in that position and a couple of hungry boys waiting to do the job for us tomorrow.’ The cover in the starting XV is Launchbury, but the young Wasps second row has struggled during the Tests in Auckland and Dunedin, which led to him being removed from the team for this match, to be replaced by Courtney Lawes. Lancaster claimed that the 23-year-old is tired at the end of a long season but Parling’s injury has presented him with an unexpected opportunity to end the tour on a high and Farrell is optimistic he can do that. ‘Joe was gutted to not be starting the match,’ he said. ‘From the reviews, he knows the reasons why, he's licked his wounds a little bit and has a chance to start. I'm sure we'll get more out of him because of that initial disappointment. He's champing at the bit and raring to go.’ Grabbing the opportunity with both hands: Launchbury has been backed to take his chance by Andy Farrell . M Brown (Harlequins); C Ashton (Saracens), M Tuilagi (Leicester), K Eastmond (Bath), M Yarde (Harlequins); F Burns (Leicester), B Youngs (Leicester); J Marler (Harlequins), D Hartley (Northampton), D Wilson (Bath); C Lawes (Northampton), J Launchbury (Wasps); T Wood (Northampton), B Vunipola (Saracens), C Robshaw (Harlequins. capt). Substitutes: R Webber (Bath), M Mullan (Wasps), K Brookes (Newcastle),  D Attwood (Bath), B Morgan (Gloucester), L Dickson (Northampton), D Cipriani (Sale), L Burrell (Northampton). After the All Blacks named their line-up for Saturday’s game at Waikato Stadium, head coach Steve Hansen mischievously suggested that England are in a tactical ‘quandary’, after, ‘tThey took us on in Dunedin playing a game of real pace and worked out they couldn’t’. Farrell was asked to respond to the remark and hit back by saying that it followed accusations that England had tried to employ stalling tactics in the series opener. ‘Well, we didn't try to slow the game down in the first Test and they thought that was our tactics and now they say we’re trying to speed the game up and can’t do that,’ he said. ‘The reality is that the game always takes its own path and we’ve got to be in control of our own game and we want to play quick at the right times, be composed at the right times and slow things down when needed. We’ll be ready for either way of playing.’ The England squad watched their football counterparts lose to Uruguay early on Friday morning, local time, and Farrell admitted that they were ‘gutted’ by the outcome. But they are convinced that they can lift the spirits of the nation’s sports fans and finish this promising tour with the victory they crave.
