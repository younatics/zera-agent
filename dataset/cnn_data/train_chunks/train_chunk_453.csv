'Toothless legislation': TSA officials will be able to touch passengers' intimate areas if they can show grounds for suspicion . Texas has backed watered-down laws to stop TSA officials touching passengers inappropriately during airport searches. But critics have accused lawmakers of passing 'toothless' legislation after it was severley altered to allow security officials to touch sexual organs if they have a 'reasonable suspicion'. The move is likely to increase anger towards intrusive searches after it emerged that 95-year-old leukemia sufferer Lena Repert was asked to remove her diaper by officials. The Texas legislation aims to criminalize intentional, inappropriate touching during airport security pat-downs. It would still be a misdemeanor punishable with up to a year in jail to touch a person's sexual organs and other sensitive areas. But security officials will have a defence against prosecution if they act with 'reasonable suspicion' that the search is necessary. That change prompted chants of 'Traitor!' by a small group of protesters at the Texas Senate today shortly after the House cast a preliminary vote in favor of the bill. Degrading: Lena Reppert, a gravely ill 95-year-old woman, had to remove her wet diaper at an airport so that she could be patted down by security screeners and nearly missed her flight . The protesters then gathered in the Senate gallery and several called out 'Treason!' to senators below. The Senate passed its version several hours after the protesters left. The Republican-controlled chambers have until Wednesday to resolve several differences between their bills before sending one to Governor Rick Perry to consider signing it into law. Supporters of the bill complained the changes make the penalties unenforceable. Texas law already bans public servants from subjecting someone to a search he or she 'knows is unlawful'. About two dozen people showed up to testify in support of the bill in the Senate Committee on Transportation and Homeland Security, then opposed it when they learned the bill was going to be changed on the recommendation of Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott, a Republican. 'The simple act of opting out of the body scanners is going to be reasonable suspicion,' said Heather Fazio of Austin. 'That is unacceptable.' Anna Drexel, six, is searched by a TSA official at New ONo one spared: Anna Drexel, six, is searched by a TSA official at New Orleans airportrleans airport . Senator Dan Patrick, R-Houston, defended the change, saying the bill still sends a strong message to Transportation Security Administration security screeners to keep their wandering hands off Texans. Patrick noted that the TSA announced last week that it would try to reduce the number of pat-downs performed on children. 'The goal is to get the TSA to change their policy,' Patrick said. ""'SA is going change their policy because Texas is taking the lead."" TSA spokesman Greg Soule said Americans expect authorities to use 'effective methods to keep the traveling public safe' and that the agency will review the bill if passed into law. All of the testimony for the bill has concentrated on stories of people being searched and included no actual examples of TSA officers being reprimanded or disciplined for improper touching. Although dismissed last week as a 'publicity stunt' by Republican House Speaker Joe Straus, the issue has become a top priority for the libertarian wing of the Texas GOP. Outcry: A TSA agent watches as a woman removes her shoes to pass through the metal detector at a security checkpoint at John F. Kennedy Airport, New York . Few Texas airports are equipped with full-body scanners, meaning there often is no other screening option for travelers picked out for what TSA calls an enhanced pat down. Opponents have simmered over procedures they consider a violation of their Constitutional right against unwarranted search and seizure. Texas made it a full-blown fight with the TSA last month when the Texas House voted to criminalize intrusive pat-downs. That . version appeared ready to pass the Senate until John E. Murphy, the . U.S. attorney for the Western District of Texas, warned lawmakers that . it would interfere with the TSA's ability to ensure travelers' safety. Murphy's . letter to legislators said if the original bill passed, the federal . government would probably go to court to block it and the TSA would . likely be required to cancel flights if it cannot ensure passenger . safety. TSA officials . say advance imaging technology and pat downs are the most effective way . to detect threats such as explosives made of plastics, liquids or gels . designed to not be detected by traditional metal detectors. The . issue prompted some small but loud demonstrations outside the House and . Senate chambers last month and many of them showed up again for . Monday's vote. Texas Gov. Rick . Perry, a Republican considering a run for president, added the pat-down . bill to the agenda of the 30-day special session he called on May 31. But the bill has lost significant momentum over the last week. Straus . appeared to strike a major blow against the original version of the . bill when he warned it would hurt commercial aviation in Texas and would . make the state a 'laughingstock'. Monday's changes further eroded support. 'TSA . is abusing people,' said Don Hart of Austin, who opposed the new . version approved Monday. 'TSA will be empowered to keep doing what they . are doing.'","Bill bans intentional inappropriate touching .

American painter Cy Twombly, renowned for his large-scale scribbled canvases, has died in Rome at the age of 83. Twombly never had an easy ride with . art experts, who questioned whether his calligraphic style and use of . words and graffiti in paintings were worthy of a place at the high table . of 20th century abstract art. But the painter, who shunned publicity, . was a star of the contemporary art world by the time of his death. Less . than two months ago a Twombly work from 1967, 'Untitled', sold for $15.2 . million at Christie's in New York. Only last year he was invited to . paint the ceiling of the Salle des Bronzes at the Louvre in Paris, only . the third contemporary artist to be given such an honour. The resulting work was an abstract . composition on a blue background complementing Georges Braque's ceiling . in the adjoining gallery. On it appeared the names of the most . celebrated classical Greek sculptors of the fourth century, underlining . Twombly's fascination for classical art and history. Gagosian Gallery, which represented the artist, did not give the cause of his death, although media reports said that Twombly had been suffering from cancer. A piece from the artist's 2005 Bacchus series is displayed at the Tate Modern . Last year Twombly was invited to paint the ceiling of the Salle des Bronzes at the Louvre in Paris, only the third contemporary artist to be given such an honour . Two untitled Twombly paintings. The artist settled permanently in Italy in the late 1950s, even as the art world . was heading in the opposite direction - from Europe to New York . Italy's Ansa news agency said he had been hospitalised in Rome for a few days and had wanted to be buried in the city. Larry Gagosian said in a statement: 'The art world has lost a true genius and a completely original talent, and for those fortunate enough to have known him, a great human being. 'We will not soon see a talent of such amazing scope and intensity. 'Even though Cy might have been regarded as reclusive, he didn't retreat to an ivory tower. He was happy to remain connected and live in the present.' This piece, entitled Venus, dates from 1975. Despite his abstract style Twombly was fascinated by classical art and history . Art lovers view a selection of Twombly's later works at the Gagosian Gallery in Rome .

He . settled permanently in Italy in the late 1950s, even as the art world . was heading in the opposite direction - from Europe to New York - a move . the New York Times called 'the most symbolic of his . idiosyncrasies'.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 2:24 PM on 18th June 2011 . Presenting himself as a real-life castaway, David Burgess said he had spent the last 26 years living in a driftwood shack by one of the Britain's most remote beaches. But it has now emerged that the 63-year-old's Robinson Crusoe-style tale may not have been quite as it seemed. According to his sister, he actually spent a lot of his time living in his mother's house before she died and now still stays with family or friends when it gets cold. For sale: The terraced home where castaway David stayed regularly with his mother Phyllis . Simple life: The 63-year-old has lived in this remote driftwood shack in Somerset for the past 26 years . Just the basics: The shack has no electricity, with Mr Burgess doing most of his cooking over an open fire . Mr Burgess had his own room at the terraced home in Exeter, Devon, of his widowed mother Phyllis and kept clothes and other possessions there. He has said he sleeps  on a . mattress of dried leaves under a blue tarpaulin every night at the tumbledown remains of a 17th Century bark drying house in Embelle Wood near Porlock, Somerset. But his sister Margaret, who stands to inherit a half-share of the Â£140,000 house which is up for sale, told the Sun her brother often stays with her. She said: 'He stays at his cabin off and on and at other times stays with friends or comes here. He likes his lifestyle out in the open, but it gets very cold up there in winter. He's got lots of friends wherever he goes and stays wherever he lays his hat.' And one of Phyllis' former neighbours added: 'David thought a lot of his mum and would come and stay with her all the time.' Enjoying the high life: David Burgess had his first taste of champagne after leaving the remote shack he calls home for a tour of Exeter . No expense spared: During his trip to Exeter Mr Burgess sipped champagne worth over Â£45 a bottle . 'Unbelievable prices': The real-life Robinson Crusoe shops in Marks & Spencer as he enjoys a taste of civilisation - but was shocked by how much the food cost . Getting to grips with his trolley: Not his usual outlet for food supplies - and, right, Mr Burgess gets his first-ever suit-fitting at Moss Bros in Exeter . Earlier this week David had a taste of the outside world - including his first ever sip of champagne. Among the novelties he experienced in Exeter, included listening to an 'amazing' iPod, sitting in a Ferrari, having a . suit-fitting and an 'unbelievable' visit to M&S. The divorced father-of-one joined . suited businessmen and smartly dressed couples, as he enjoyed an . expensive lunch at Michelin-starred chef Michael Caines' restaurant at . the city's plush Abode Hotel - and sipped champagne priced at Â£47.25 a . bottle. 'This is . absolutely lovely, I feel like a celebrity,' Burgess said. 'It has . simply never occurred to me to order champagne before, I'm happy with . orange juice and water. 'I feel like James Bond': David tries out a Ferrari California convertible worth Â£160,000 . Thinking ahead: 'I'd need a car I could sleep in the back of,' said Dave . 'It's a very nice treat but I am not . sure it is worth Â£50 - that's my food budget for a month. I'm definitely . telling my son about this, he won't believe it. I prefer sitting out by the sea and cooking soup over an open fire.' Mr . Burgess then ordered a Â£24 lunch of pan-fried Devonshire sea bass, . which came with fennel puree, confit tomato, fennel cream and a rich . fish red wine sauce. He said, 'That's a very small portion . for the money. It hardly seems worth it. It is absolutely beautiful . though, I haven't eaten food like this for years. I usually have nettle soup or shellfish and seaweed so this is a real change.' Mr Burgess - who has been divorced . from his wife for 33 years - said he could be convinced to dine out more . but only if he found his very own 'Girl Friday'. Continuing his tour, he then visited a . Marks & Spencer for the first time, where he joked with staff that . he fancied a 'nice young bird' to take home and said he could not . believe the prices of items on the carefully stocked shelves. 'I can't believe the amount of food on offer here and all of the places it comes from,' Mr Burgess said. 'If . I need to shop, I go to local organic stores where most of the produce . is local. All of this is very exotic.There are so many ready meals too. I . don't have electricity at home, let alone a microwave. 'I don't suppose you could cook them over an open fire because all the plastic would melt.' Mr Burgess also went for his first-ever . suit fitting at Moss Bros in Exeter, who measured him up for a neat new outfit. He kept . his battered brown hat on, along with scruffy jeans and a flowing velvet scarf, . as he examined the suits. His favourite . was a smart Ted Baker outfit, costing a cool Â£279, but also liked a Moss Bros . Â£129 version. Sparsely furnished: Mr Burgess sleeps on a mattress of dried leaves under a blue tarpaulin . Hidden away: The shack is so remote that it is an hour's walk away from the nearest road . Mr Burgess . said: 'These suits do look very smart but I am happy in my own clothes. 'I . always shop at charity shops - you can pick up some real bargains there.' And David beamed with excitement as he tried out a . Ferrari California convertible - worth an eye-watering Â£160,000. He . carefully sat inside the cream-coloured car - which boasts a 4.3 litre V8 . engine - at Ferrari dealership Carrs in Exeter. Manager . Lee Moore showed him how to work the convertible's impressive on-board computer . and gave him a tour of the fleet of Ferraris and Maseratis at the dealership. Long time hidden: Mr Burgess first moved in to the beachside shack in the 1980s . Mr Burgess . said: 'Gosh, I feel like James Bond sat in here. I had a horse and . carriage when I was in my 40s and 50s as I worked in a gypsy museum in . Somerset. 'I . imagine this would be a bit quicker though. It's lovely. 'I . don't really like driving to be honest, I find the traffic too stressful. I . wouldn't even think about buying the Ferrari, it's not for me. Ear we go: David spent half an hour carefully studying computers, iPhones and iPads, which he admitted he was 'bemused' by . 'I'd . need a car I could sleep in the back of, it would be my dream to have a camper . van. 'I . feel pretty awkward sat in this, I'm worried I'm going to break it.' He also told of his shock as he tried out an 'amazing' iPod for the first time - as he visited the smart Apple store in Exeter, Devon, which stocks . the latest technology from the iconic brand. He spent . half an hour carefully studying computers, iPhones and iPads, which he . admitted he was 'bemused' by. Mr Burgess . said: 'Everyone is always saying that I should get a computer but I've . never had one. 'I . don't really see the point. These things all look very smart but they are . nothing compared to the view I get when I look out to the sea. 'I . suppose if I went abroad to work on an organic farm then I might get an email . address to keep in touch with people. 'I've . never seen anything like this before, it really is amazing. It's certainly . opened my eyes to new things.' Mr Burgess began building his idyllic home in 1985.The woodland site is an hour's walk from the nearest road down a treacherous path and only a handful of people knew of his existence - until now. But he could be forced to leave his beachfront paradise after bosses at Exmoor National Park threatened to evict him. He is now awaiting a decision from park chiefs as they decide his fate.","'Castaway' often stays with his family away from remote beach hut .

"FDA estimates new labels will . reduce number of smokers by 213,000 in 2013 . By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 2:29 PM on 21st June 2011 . Dead bodies, diseased lungs and a man on a ventilator were among the . graphic images for revamped tobacco labels unveiled today by U.S. health officials. In the most significant change to . U.S. cigarette packs in 25 years, the nine new labels - which include phrases like 'Smoking can . kill you' and 'Cigarettes cause cancer'  - must be on cigarette packages and in advertisements . starting in October 2012. Proposed in November under a law that put the multibillion-dollar . tobacco industry under the control of the Food and Drug Administration, the labels send a clear message to consumers about the dangers of tobacco - responsible for about 443,000 . U.S. deaths a year. Health risk: A mother holding her baby appears on one of the nine newly-designed cigarette labels - as smoke swirls around them . New cigarette packs feature graphic images, such as rotting and diseased teeth and gums and a man with a tracheotomy smoking. Also included among the labels are and a mother holding her baby . with smoke swirling around them. Each label includes a national quit smoking hotline number. The labels will take up the top half of a pack of cigarette packs. Warning labels also must appear in advertisements and constitute 20 per cent of an ad. Cigarette makers have until autumn 2012 to comply. Mandates to introduce new graphic warning labels were part of a law passed in 2009 that, for the first time, gave the federal government authority to regulate tobacco, including setting guidelines for marketing and labelling, banning certain products and limiting nicotine. Addictive: A man with a tracheotomy smoking appears in a new label provided by the Food and Drug Administration today . Graphic: One of nine new warning labels cigarette makers will have to use by autumn 2012 . The announcement follows reviews of . scientific literature, public comments and results from an . FDA-contracted study of 36 labels proposed last November. In recent years, more than 30 countries or jurisdictions have introduced labels similar to those being introduced by the FDA. The U.S. first mandated the use of warning labels stating 'Cigarettes may be hazardous to your health' in 1965. Current warning labels - a small box with black and white text - were put on cigarette packs in the mid-1980s. The FDA says the new labels will 'clearly and effectively convey the health risks of smoking' aimed at encouraging current smokers to quit and discourage non-smokers and youth from starting to use cigarettes. American Cancer Society CEO John R Seffrin applauded the new labels in a statement, saying they have the potential to 'encourage adults to give up their deadly addiction to cigarettes and deter children from starting in the first place'. Mandates: The labels will take up the top half of a cigarette pack. Warning labels also must appear in advertisements and constitute 20 per cent of an ad . Cancer-causing: The new labels mark the most significant change to U.S. cigarette packs in 25 years . The new labels come as the share of . Americans who smoke has fallen dramatically since 1970, from nearly 40 . percent to about 20 percent. The rate has stalled since about 2004. About 46 million adults in the U.S. smoke cigarettes. It's unclear why declines in smoking have stalled. Some experts have cited tobacco company discount coupons on cigarettes or lack of funding for programs to discourage smoking or to help smokers quit. While it is impossible to say how many people quit because of the labels, various studies suggest the labels do spur people to quit. The new labels offer the opportunity for a pack-a-day smoker to see graphic warnings on the dangers of cigarettes more than 7,000 times per year. The FDA estimates the new labels will . reduce the number of smokers by 213,000 in 2013, with smaller . additional reductions through 2031. Crackdown: They were proposed in November under a law that put the multibillion-dollar tobacco industry under the control of the Food and Drug Administration . Worth dying for? Tobacco is responsible for about 443,000 U.S. deaths a year, according to the FDA . The World Health Organization said in . a survey done in countries with graphic warning labels that a majority . of smokers noticed the warnings and more than 25 per cent said the . warnings led them to consider quitting. While some have voiced concerns over the hard-hitting nature of some of the labels, those concerns should be trumped by the government's responsibility to warn people about the dangers of smoking, said David Hammond, a health behaviour researcher at the University of Waterloo in Canada, who worked with the firm designing the labels for the FDA. 'This isn't about doing what's . pleasant for people. It's about fulfilling the government's mandate if . they're going to allow these things to be sold,' Hammond said. 'What's . bothering people is the risk associated with their behaviour, not the . warnings themselves.' In places like Canada, Hammond said . smokers offended by some of the images on cigarettes packs there started . asking for different packs when they received ones with certain gory . images, or used a case to cover them up. But smokers said those warnings . still had an effect on them. Effective: The World Health Organization said in a survey done in countries with graphic labels that a majority of smokers noticed the warnings and more than 25 per cent said the warnings led them to consider quitting . Bad for branding: Tobacco makers have argued the warnings would relegate the companies' brands to the bottom half of the cigarette packaging, making them 'difficult, if not impossible, to see' Canada introduced similar warning . labels in 2000. Since then, its smoking rates have declined from about . 26 per cent to about 20 per cent. How much the warnings contributed to . the decline is unclear because the country also implemented other . tobacco control efforts. The legality of the new labels also is part of a pending federal lawsuit filed by Winston-Salem, North Carolina-based Reynolds American Inc, parent company of America's second-largest cigarette maker, RJ Reynolds; number three cigarette maker, Greensboro, North Carolina-based Lorillard Inc; and others. Tobacco makers in the lawsuit have argued the warnings would relegate the companies' brands to the bottom half of the cigarette packaging, making them 'difficult, if not impossible, to see.' A spokesman for Richmond, Virginia-based Altria Group Inc, parent company of the nation's largest cigarette maker, Philip Morris USA, said the company was looking at the final labels but would not comment further.","FDA estimates new labels will .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 3:37 PM on 30th June 2011 . Cutbacks: Lloyds Chief-Executive Antonio Horta-Osorio said that 15,000 jobs will go . Lloyds announced that 15,000 jobs will be axed over the next three years to save Â£1.5billion a year. The huge cull will take job losses to more than 40,000 since Lloyds TSB merged with HBOS in 2009. However, despite the drastic cost-cutting measures the bank claimed not a single extra branch will close. New chief executive Antonio Horta-Osorio revealed the cutbacks today as part of his strategic review of the taxpayer-backed lender. No UK bank has ever shed no many jobs in corporate history. All of the jobs will go by the end of 2014. The chief executive said the majority of the the positions set to be axed are at managerial level with hundreds expected to go from the London head office. Branch staff are expected to be largely unaffected as the posts go by the end of 2014. Lloyds will also look to use natural staff attrition and internal redeployment rather than redundancy where possible. However, the Unite union said the review will cause 'deep distress and anxiety' across the company. David Fleming, Unite national officer, added: 'Astonishingly one in eight roles will be lost over the next three years. 'This review is merely another box-ticking exercise to give this bank - which has already, since its creation two years ago, cut over 27,000 staff - an excuse to sack more employees.' Mr Horta-Osorio, the Portuguese-born . banker who took the top post in March after being poached from rival . Santander, also announced plans to reduce the company's international . presence from 30 countries to less than half that number by 2014. He also pledged to revitalise the Halifax brand. Massive job losses: Cull of 40,000 at Lloyds is the biggest round of cuts at a UK bank in corporate history. The majority of the latest round of job losses will be at managerial level . Lloyds Banking Group unveiled Mr Horta-Osorio as its new chief executive in November last year. He joined as executive director in January and started the job in March. He became chief executive of Santander-owned Abbey in 2006, which was later rebranded as Santander UK. During his time at Santander UK, he snapped up Alliance & Leicester for Â£1.26 billion, Bradford & Bingley's savings book and 197 branches for Â£612 million and 318 branches from Royal Bank of Scotland. When the businesses all came together under the Santander UK brand at the beginning of the year, it became the UK's third biggest bank - with a customer base of 26 million and more than 1,300 branches. Banking giant HSBC also announced today they will cut 700 jobs across the UK as it prepares for a drop in demand for financial advice due to upcoming changes in the law. The company is reshaping its wealth management business before Retail Distribution Review rules are introduced in January 2013. The new law will mean UK banks can no longer offer financial advice for free, so HSBC expects demand for the service to decline. However, the bank will still have 1,500 advisers across the UK. The blow to staff comes on the day Lloyds Banking Group announced 15,000 job cuts by 2014. Lloyds Banking Group has already cut 27,500 jobs since it was formed less than three years ago. The part-nationalised lender, formed in January 2009 from the merger of HBOS and Lloyds TSB, has cut jobs across the business - from motor finance to insurance and from IT to wholesale banking, as well as closing a number of call centres.Since January 2009 the lender has repeatedly unveiled plans to axe jobs - although today's announcement is the largest so far.","No UK bank has ever shed so many jobs in corporate history .

A New York professor has died three days after she and four others were hit in a bloodbath shooting at her Pennsylvania weekend home. Monica Shay, 58, a professor at the Pratt Institute in Brooklyn died yesterday after being injured when gunman Mark Geisenheyner went on the rampage on Sunday. The arts and culture professor lived in New York but kept her childhood home in Douglass Township as a weekend retreat. She and her husband Paul Shay were targeted by the man as he sought revenge after being imprisoned for an insurance scam he had allegedly carried out with Mr Shay. Mrs Shay's brother, Edward Newbold, . told ABC6: 'She was beautiful, loved. She was a wonderful beautiful . person. I miss her so much.' Prosecutors revealed that the mother of a two-year-old boy shot in cold blood by a career criminal . made a haunting 911 call begging police to 'help my baby'. Terrified and covered in blood after being shot herself, Kathryn Erdmann made the . call after watching helplessly as Geisenheyner, 51, put a handgun to the . back of her little boy's head and pulled the trigger. The horrific details emerged as prosecutors revealed Geisenheyner was a . career criminal who carried out the holiday massacre as revenge for an . insurance scam that landed him in jail. He was killed by SWAT teams after shooting dead two-year-old Gregory . Erdmann and his stepfather, and critically wounding three others. Police said he had planned the . murder of Paul Shay, the owner of the rural home in Douglass Township, . Pennsylvania, for more than a year after he was imprisoned for an . insurance scam the two had allegedly carried out. Shooting: Mark Geisenheyner, left, allegedly went on the rampage at the holiday home of Paul Shay, right, after he was imprisoned for an insurance scam it was claimed he carried out with Mr Shay . According to prosecutors, Geisenheyner had no idea there would be five people in the house when he walked in brandishing a handgun on Saturday night - but he had no compunction in shooting everybody in the property, including little Gregory. The boy's mother, 37-year-old Miss Erdmann, had been excited about her planned July 4th weekend with her boyfriend, Joseph Shay, to meet his aunt and uncle, Paul and Monica Shay. She is now fighting for her life in hospital along with 64-year-old Paul Shay, who owns a plumbing business in New York. Miss Erdmann's boyfriend, 43-year-old Joseph Shay, died at the scene. After watching helplessly as her son was shot, Miss Erdmann rang police and desperately told the . operator: 'I don't know where I am. Please help my baby.' Haunting phone call: Kathryn Erdmann rang police begging them to save little Gregory's life after watching helplessly as the gunman put a pistol to her son's head and pulled the trigger . Montgomery County prosecutors described how Geisenheyner burst into the . Shays' rural holiday home with a .22-calibre gun and announced: 'Guess . you never thought youâd see me again'. Kevin . Steele, the county's assistant district attorney, said: 'I don't think . Geisenheyner expected anyone else to be there. But that didn't stop him . from assassinating a toddler.' He said Miss Erdmann and her son were simply in the wrong place at the wrong time, and Paul Shay was the intended target. Geisenheyner . had told friends he had been cut out of the profits for an insurance . scam he and Mr Shay had allegedly plotted, according to prosecutors, and . for which he had been jailed. The . two had allegedly arranged for Geisenheyner to steal a painting from Mr . Shay's East Village home in New York, prosecutors said. But . Geisenheyner was arrested for theft and sent back to prison for . violating the terms of his parole. Montgomery . County district attorney Risa Ferman said: 'When Geisenheyner got out . of prison, he was determined to exact revenge on Paul Shay.' Tense stand-off: Police outside the house in Trainer, Pennsylvania, where Mark Geisenheyner was killed by SWAT officers following a shooting at a home in Douglass Township which left two dead and three injured . Confession: Prosecutors say Geisenheyner admitted to shooting the five. He was killed after a six-hour stand-off yesterday . After . the shooting Geisenheyner, who has a criminal record stretching back to . the 1970s, fled to the home of a man he had got to know in prison, in . Trainer, Pennsylvania. He arrived in the early hours of Monday morning, and confessed to the horrified man that he had just shot five people. He . let Geisenheyner into the house, and then waited until he had fallen . asleep to run out and call police. He told his landlord he prayed he . wouldn't be murdered. When Geisenheyner woke up later that morning, 125 SWAT officers had surrounded the home. In . a tense six-hour stand-off, in which teams fired tear gas and . percussion bombs into the house, Geisenheyner admitted what he had done, . and told police he had no intention of going back to prison. After . multiple attempts to make him come out, officers stormed the house at . around 11.45am. They found Geisenheyner in the basement, and shot him . when they saw he was armed with a .45-calibre handgun. Grim details: Delaware County District Attorney Mike Green and Montgomery County District Attorney Risa Ferman hold a press conference outside the home in Trainer where Geisenheyer was killed by SWAT teams .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 2:34 PM on 4th July 2011 . Tony Blair was warned by MI6 that his feud with Gordon Brown was becoming so problematic that France and Germany were plotting to exploit their differences, it has been claimed. The latest volumes of Alastair Campbellâs diaries reveal that intelligence memos were passed to Blair informing him that Germany believed he and Brown 'were on different tracks' and that they, as well as the French, planned to take advantage of this. At an EU summit in Nice in December 2000, Campbell noted: 'The French and Germans, according to the spooks, were exploiting the fact that GB was seen as a rival to TB, to try to divide them further.' According to new revelations, the rivalry between Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, left, was thought to be a risk to British interests on the world stage . In an earlier diary entry, on October 12, Campbell wrote: 'TB showed me a piece of intelligence which showed that the Germans assessed our problems on Europe ... [as] a sense that TB and GB were on a different track to each other.' Meanwhile, Campbellâs diaries also reveal that Mr Blair . repeatedly told him that Ed Balls, now shadow Chancellor and then Mr . Brownâs senior adviser, was a âhighly disruptive influenceâ. Last month, private papers showed Balls had been part of a âbrutalâ plot to topple Mr Blair just days after the 7/7 attacks. The Prime Minister told Mr Campbell, his chief spin doctor, that Mr Balls kept talking to him as if he were a mere junior official. Mr Campbell wrote, on 25 April 2001: âTBâ¦ said he had just about had enough of Ed Balls talking to him like something on his shoe.â The diaries, published in the Guardian, also revealed that Mr Balls breached Treasury rules by leaking details of the governmentâs response to the fuel duty protests â that fuel duty would be frozen for two years â before Brownâs pre-budget report in November 2000. Revelations: Former Labour spin doctor Alistair Campbell claims Tony Blair told him Ed Balls was a disruptive influence in his government . Mr Campbell wrote: âIt was wrong to leak tax measuresâ¦ it was misleading.â Mr Balls continues to deny he was involved in any plots to oust Mr Blair. The . diaries also reveal that MI6 handed Tony Blair a private intelligence . assessment which showed that the French and German governments had drawn . up plans to exploit his divisions with Gordon Brown, according to . Alastair Campbell. The pair rowed about the euro, with Mr Brown telling the PM in 1999: âDo you want to be responsible for mass unemployment?â Relations got so bad in 2000, Mr Blair was forced to ask Lord (Richard) Attenborough, the actor and director, to mediate between them. Disruption: Ed Balls, pictured, allegedly plotted against Tony Blair while he was PM . As early as 2001, Mr Brown put pressure on him to set a date for his departure, and in April of that year he told Mr Blair he was âcrapâ and that he should stand down to allow for the restoration of cabinet government. Just two months before the 2001 election Mr Brown accused Mr Blair of having âbetrayedâ him when he stood for the Labour leadership in 1994 and of having taken âthat job away from meâ. On the day before the 2001 general election Mr Blair told his inner circle he had âsadly, very sadlyâ reached the conclusion that Brown was working against him. But he said it was impossible to sack him or move him from his position as chancellor.] . The diaries also reveal Mr Blair turned âwhite with furyâ â and later rebuked Brown in private â when his chancellor responded with âvenom and contemptâ to his question at a presentation by Treasury officials. On 9/11 Mr Blair excluded his Chancellor from a smaller ministerial meeting in Downing Street, following the main Cobra crisis meeting, because his answers had become âmonosyllabicâ in recent discussions.","Blair labelled Brown's then henchman Ed Balls 'highly disruptive influence', claims Campbell ."

Rory McIlroy set his sights on more major glory as he made an emotional return to the golf club where his journey to sporting stardom began. The 22-year-old record-breaking US Open winner said it was fantastic to be among old friends again as he arrived at Holywood Golf Club in County Down with his trophy tucked tightly under his arm. McIlroy landed back in Northern Ireland last night after what he said had been a whirlwind few days following his triumph at Congressional in Maryland.

'It's fantastic to be back here to see all my friends, my family,' he said. 'I . can't thank my parents enough for what they've done for me and winning . the US Open is only a tiny little bit of my appreciation for what . they've done, so hopefully there's more trophies for them in the future . and more things for us to share and celebrate.' The . homecoming event in Holywood came a year after similar euphoric scenes . in Portrush, 60 miles up the road, when McIlroy's compatriot and close . friend Graeme McDowell won the same tournament. 'Graeme inspired me and gave me a lot of belief that I could do the same thing,' McIlroy added. 'If Graeme hadn't won last year I don't know if I would be standing here talking to you as a major champion.' On his return, McIlroy said that the . people of Northern Ireland deserve a peaceful future adding that he was . sad to return home to fresh violence.

In a region of numerous divisions, . many played out in a sport context, McIlroy is one personality with . legions of fans across communities. He said he has a responsibility as a . role model. 'I am very aware of the fact that I am going to be portrayed . as a role model for a lot of young people in Northern Ireland, and . probably across the world. 'And I have to be very careful in . what I say and what I do, and as long as I portray the right image for . other people to look up to, that's all I can really do.' After . spending two hours inside the clubhouse, where the walls are covered . with pictures of his triumphs, McIlroy emerged onto the balcony to a . rapturous welcome from fans waiting below.

McIlroy, . who was accompanied to the club by childhood sweetheart Holly Sweeney, . conceded soaring expectations of what he can achieve in the game would . be tough to handle. 'It's going to be difficult,' he said. 'The first couple of weeks will be a . bit of a challenge, but it's a nice position to be in, to have that . pressure, to have that expectation. 'As . long I can stay focused on what I need to do, that is play good golf, . and let everything else take care of itself, then I'll be okay.'

I've won one very early on in my . career but at the same time I know how hard these things are to win and . hopefully I will be able to win more in the future. 'But 18 Majors is an incredible achievement and it would take some very special golf to be able to beat that.'

"By . Rob Cooper . Last updated at 3:38 PM on 2nd September 2011 . Migrant boom: David Frost, the outgoing business chief, said foreign workers are better qualified and have a better attitude . Migrant workers land the majority of new jobs created in Britain because they are more hardworking than their British counterparts, a business leader claimed today. David Frost, on his last day as director general of the British Chambers of Commerce, said foreign workers flooding into the country had brought about a dramatic change in the labour market. He dismissed suggestions that overseas employees get jobs because they are prepared to work for low wages - but said they had a stronger work ethic. Mr Frost said that the Government would have to 'radically change' the welfare system so that it never paid not to be in work. Nine out of ten people who joined the workforce last year were foreign nationals, official figures have revealed. Gordon Brown was widely criticised for a promise to provide 'British jobs, for British workers' as figures showed new jobs were going to economic migrants. Between 1997 and 2010, more than half of the rise in employment in the UK was accounted for by foreign nationals. Mr Frost said foreign workers are often better qualified and more enthusiastic. Hard-working and dedicated: Migrant workers at a vegetable market in Lancashire. Nine out of ten new jobs last year went to foreign workers . 'Overwhelmingly, business has adopted . migrant workers for the simple reason that they are often better . educated and have a stronger work ethic than local people,' he said. Fears about the health of the economy were fanned today after two key surveys revealed a worrying slowdown in the construction industry. New orders fell by 16.3 per cent in the second quarter of this year to their lowest level since 1980, the Office for National Statistics revealed. And the sector grew in August at its slowest pace this year as the housing sector continued to contract and confidence hit its lowest level for seven months, according to a Markit/CIPS survey. The surveys suggest the sector, which has seen strong growth in recent months, could be running out of momentum and will add to fears that the UK's economy is in danger of slipping back into recession. The gloomy surveys suggest the sector, which grew by 0.5 per cent in the second quarter of the year, is being dragged downwards as confidence is eroded amid the . Government spending cuts and the general global economic slowdown. The manufacturing sector is also suffering a slowdown, according to recent figures, while the powerhouse services sector is still in growth but is being squeezed as disposable income is hit by inflation. Howard Archer, economist at IHS Global Insight, said the latest ONS construction data were 'horrible' and it 'bodes ill for output prospects in the near term at least'. He said: 'The construction sector faces an extremely challenging environment, which threatens to weigh down appreciably on activity over the coming months.' 'It is not about paying lower wages. If the Government is serious about British jobs for British workers, then not only do they have to improve the education system, but also radically change the welfare system so it never pays not to work.' In a bid to kick-start the economy, business chief Mr Frost also said there needed to be a bonfire of red tape and an . end to 'endless tinkering' with regulations. 'There have been six major changes to parental rights in the last 10 years,' he said. 'Small businesses in particular are worried about getting it wrong and ending up in front of an employment tribunal, so the default is often only to employ an extra person as a last resort. 'This is hardly the right outcome when we have 2.5million people unemployed in the UK.' Figures released yesterday raise questions about whether the Governmentâs drive to get millions off benefits and into work can be achieved without further curbs on immigration. They will also increase pressure to reform the bloated benefits system. The figures, produced by the Office for National Statistics, reveal that employment among working age people rose by 181,000 in the Coalitionâs first year. Yet employment levels among British nationals rose by just 14,000, or less than 8 per cent of the total. Employment among non-UK nationals rose by 163,000 during the period â equal to more than 90 per cent of the total. TUC general secretary Brendan Barber said that it is not true that it pays to be unemployed. 'Benefit levels are already very low in the UK. If we want to ensure people are better off in work, we need to improve the quality of work and not reduce pay, vital employment rights or benefits,' he said.","90% of new jobs went to foreign workers last year .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 10:38 PM on 26th June 2011 . A grandmother trapped by fire was seen screaming âHelp me! Help me!â from her bedroom window before she and her husband died in the blaze. Anna Crowther, 46, and her husband Victor, 48, were trapped in their terraced house in Hull when the fire broke out at 6am on Saturday. Neighbours rushed to help after hearing desperate Mrs Crowther's screams. Floral tributes: A man and woman living in this house in Hull died after a fire which may have been started by fairy lights . But before they could do anything fire exploded through the front window of the house, which the fire service say did not have a smoke alarm. Fire investigators say the fire could have been started by fairy lights it is believed the Crowthers had wrapped around the bannister of their home. Three fire engines and 15 fire fighters fought the blaze, which left the house so badly damaged that when fire crews entered the stairs collapsed. Neighbours had tried to rescue the couple with ladders, but were beaten back by the fierce heat. Dad-of-one Danny Draper, 28, a tree surgeon who lives opposite the Crowthers, said: 'I could hear Anna screaming out of the window, the fire was at the back of the house. 'We got the ladder there but before I could go up the window popped. Anna had been at the small window at the top screaming, but the entire frame just blew out. 'Then we didn't hear anything, the screaming stopped. 'There was thick, black smoke all over the street. I went up the ladder but it was too hot. 'There was a leg hanging out of the window, I hope the kids on the street didn't see that. 'I tried to get in through the front door. I managed to kick the porch door open and was trying to get in the second when the fire brigade arrived.' Terrified Ms Allison grabbed five-month-old daughter Mia and rushed out of her house, covering the baby's head with a blanket to protect her from the heavy smoke outside. 'I was going to drop the baby around a neighbour's house across the road and try and come back and smash the window with a hammer or something,' she said. 'But by the time I got outside she had stopped screaming, she was gone. 'I will never forget the sound of her cries for help, I haven't been able to sleep since it happened. 'I saw them the day before and it was so normal. They were such lovely people, she had a cat she adored.' Tragedy: Fire investigators are trying to work out what caused the fire, which was so fierce it the stairs in the house collapsed as fire crews entered . Neighbours searched for the couple's beloved cat Theo after the fire and thought he too had perished, but he turned up in the evening. Neighbour Paul Metheringham, 46, who is now looking after Theo, said: 'Anna loved her cat and we thought it had died too. It's a small mercy the cat survived. 'It came back to the house and was stood there looking lost so I took it in.' Devastated children Samantha, 28, and Darrel, 26, came to view the charred remains of the house today. Samantha said: 'We are heartbroken. They were such lovely people, they lived for their grandchildren. They were so loving. We can't believe they are gone. The pair are comforting younger brother Jamie, 25, Samantha's son Dillon, three, and Darrel's daughter Chenille, four, as they come to terms with the tragedy. There are still shards of glass on the pavement outside the house, which has a number of floral tributes left outside. One heartbreaking message read: 'Mum and dad, I love you so much. I can't believe you've gone and won't be here anymore. 'We will always miss you. I hope you're both together and happy where you are. I'll miss you forever, bye, Sami, Dillon, Darrel, Jamie.' Grim search: A fire investigator sifts through charred rubble to gather evidence at the rear of the house. The couple are believed not to have owned a fire alarm . Fire investigation teams are now trying to find the cause of the fire. The Crowthers, who were both non-smokers, are believed to have had fairy lights around their bannister, officers are investigating these as well as electrical appliances at the burnt-out home. Humberside Fire Group leader Keith Evans said: 'We were alerted to a fire on Montrose Street at 6.15am yesterday (SAT) and we mobilised three pumping appliances and 15 fire fighters who were at the scene within three minutes. 'The conditions were severe and all three emergency services were at the scene. 'Unfortunately by the time we were able to locate the occupants, there was no further medical assistance that could be offered. 'Fire fighting operations continued in the extremely damaged property until 7am and a specialist fire investigation team are continuing an in depth investigation.

"Move escalates row over independence of Scottish law . By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 9:50 AM on 20th June 2011 . Convicted child killer: Luke Mitchell is taking his fight to the Supreme Court . A convicted Scottish child killer - who slit his girlfriend's throat repeatedly with a knife - could soon be released by England's Supreme Court. Luke Mitchell is trying to get his 2005 conviction for killing his girlfriend Jodi Jones, 14, overturned. He claims his trial was unfair as he was denied access to a lawyer during police interview and says evidence taken from that interview was 'crucial' to the Crown's case against him. In April, the Appeal Court in Edinburgh ruled his life sentence should stand, and refused to refer his case to the Supreme Court in London. And so his legal team is taking their fight directly to the English capital - in a move which has escalated the row between the Scottish government and Westminster over the independence of Scots law. Scotlandâs First Minister Alex Salmond has accused the Supreme Court of undermining his country's law. It could see Mitchell freed - because English judges have previously ruled the Scottish system of letting suspects be held and questioned for six hours without access to a lawyer breaches the European Convention on Human Rights. Mitchell, 22, was handed a life sentence in 2005 after he was found guilty of murdering Jodi Jones, 14, in Dalkeith, Midlothian, in 2003. He has always maintained his innocence and said his trial was unfair because, under the Scottish legal system, he was not allowed to have a lawyer for six hours. The system has since been declared a breach of human rights under the Cadder ruling. Judges in London upheld an appeal by teenager Peter Cadder, whose assault conviction was based on evidence gained before he spoke to his lawyer. His lawyers argued this was a breach of his human rights. In 2009, he was convicted at Glasgow Sheriff Court of two assaults and a breach of the peace following an incident in the city in May 2007. Murdered: Jodi Jones (pictured) had her throat repeatedly slit by Luke Mitchell . Even though the High Court is the highest court of criminal appeal in Scotland, it was overruled by the Supreme Court on a constitutional issue. This was because the need to consider European human rights legislation was written into the Scotland Act - the piece of Westminster legislation which established devolution. In light of the Cadder ruling, 867 cases were abandoned, including 60 serious cases, nine of which were High Court cases. Contrary to the landmark Cadder Supreme Court decision, the Appeal Court in Edinburgh ruled in AprilÂ  that Mitchell's conviction should stand. Lord Justice General, Lord Hamilton and two other judges dismissed Mitchell's claim that his human rights had been breached. Undermined: Scotland's First Minister Alex Salmond has accused the Supreme Court of undermining Scots law . And so Mitchellâs legal team is going directly to the Supreme Court in London, which Scotlandâs First Minister Alex Salmond has accused of undermining Scots law, to plead 'exceptional circumstances'. Nicholas Scullion, head of a Scottish law firm, told the Sunday Express: 'The Supreme Court probably will call this in and if so, they have to release him. 'Alex Salmond knows itâs not going to be popular, so it could not have gone better for him... English judges freeing a Scottish child murderer.' English barrister Jodie Blackstock, who acted for Peter Cadder when he won his landmark ruling, said Mitchellâs case was very similar. In June 2003, Mitchell murdered Jodi in woods near Roan's Dyke path, between their homes in the Newbattle and Easthouses area of Dalkeith, Midlothian. Victim: Jodi Jones (pictured) was just 14-years-old when she was killed by her boyfriend Luke Mitchell . Her throat was slit by between 12 and 20 blows with a knife, and extensive mutilation of the face and body was inflicted after death. Jodi had failed to return home after going to meet Mitchell. He claimed she had not arrived, and he spent the evening with friends. He said he later learned from Jodi's family that she was missing and joined in a search. He claimed he was alerted by his dog jumping up at Roan's Dyke, and went over the wall to find Jodi's body. But other people who were there said he had gone straight to a break in the wall and made the discovery. The prosecution at his trial asserted that, as the killer, he had known the body was there and had pretended to find it by accident. Mitchell was found guilty by a jury and given a life sentence.

"By . Jaya Narain . Last updated at 11:01 AM on 22nd June 2011 . Artful Dodger: Levers Zinca was banned from an area of Longsight, Manchester . Posing as a starving beggar, he targets innocent cashpoint users with all the skill of a modern day Artful Dodger. As they punch their pin numbers into the machine to withdraw their money, the teenage thief swoops. Distracting them by holding a placard or newspaper in front of their faces he pleads for money for food. But as their view is blocked he presses the Â£200 button and pockets the cash, leaving his anxious victims to hurry away without realising they have been robbed. Now one of the scores of Romanian children who operate in Fagin-style gangs has been named and shamed. Levers Zinca, 15, has been handed an Asbo after being repeatedly hauled before the courts. Starting when he was just 11 years old police say the teenage thief has made a career of his distraction thefts and has made off with many thousands of pounds. He is just one of dozens of similar youngsters targeting cashpoint users across the UK. Just 18 months ago police smashed a child trafficking ring after a series of dawn raids in Manchester. Operation Epee aimed to smash the Roma organised crime groups which illegally brought children to Manchester so they could take to the streets and rob the public. Fifteen children from the Roma community were taken into temporary care to protect them. Police fear many children are being taken from their families and used by gangmasters to commit theft and robbery. Working with another teenager called Spartacus Mihai, Levers Zinca would swoop on cashpoint users in Longsight, Manchester. He had a massive criminal record with a string of convictions for identical thefts and robbery dating back to 2007, when he was just 11 years old. Zinca has been banned from an area along Stockport Road between Kirmanshulme Lane and Delamere Road . Despite being handed detention and training orders totalling 44 months, the teenager simply returned to his life of crime. When he was hauled before magistrates he admitted a further six counts of theft and two of attempted theft. Now he has been told he could face a jail sentence of up to five years if he fails to abide by the terms of a three-year Asbo. An interpreter was in court to translate the proceedings for Zinca and his father, who has eight children and receives around Â£460-a-week in state benefits. One victim told police that he was targeted by the boy just before Christmas when he was getting cash out to buy presents for his children. Another told them: âI feel so angry this has happened. I blame myself and feel responsible as the money was for my family. I didn't sleep last night. I can't believe somebody would do this.â Nick Vitti, prosecuting, told Manchester magistrates court the ASBO was 'a proportionate response to what has happened in order to protect the public'. He added: âThe modus operandi of these offences are that this defendant approached people at cash points in concert with other people. Those victims were distracted and money was taken from them. They were robbed, basically.â After the hearing, Constable Dale Chadwick of Greater Manchester Police said: âThese were cowardly and callous crimes targeting vulnerable people at cashpoints. âThis will hopefully bring closure for his many victims who have been left extremely distressed by what he has put them through. The police and the council will work tirelessly to make the streets safer and hopefully this will make the community safer.â Cllr Jim Battle, deputy leader of Manchester Council, said: âThis was completely unacceptable criminal behaviour and Manchester residents should be free to use cash machines in the city without fear of having their money stolen. âResidents should be reassured that we have taken this order out, and I'd urge anyone who sees him breaking any of the conditions to contact the police immediately.â","Levers Zinca blocked people's view and pressed the Â£200 button as they withdrew money and pocketed the cash .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 9:00 AM on 7th July 2011 . The cost of using the internet on a tablet in Europe is to be more than halved (posed by model) Excessive charges for using smartphones and laptops to access the internet and emails while abroad are to be slashed. Travellers can be billed up to 50 times more than at home to download a song, picture or map, generating huge bills. These so-called data roaming charges can be as much as Â£10.70 per megabyte, which would be equivalent to downloading a single picture or a minute of music. However, the EU has announced plans for a cap that will bring down the average charge of Â£2 per megabyte to 80p from July next year. There are plans to cut the figure further to 45p in July 2014. The new price regime will only apply to EU citizens visiting another member state. There will be no protection for those travelling to other destinations such as Turkey, the U.S. or Australia. The proposals were outlined by EU digital chief Neelie Kroes, who is hoping new companies, such as supermarkets, will enter the market to increase competition. The eventual aim is to bring the cost of using smartphones and laptops overseas to around the same level as at home. The EU has already capped the price of calls and texts from other EU nations. Monique Goyens, of European consumers' group BEUC, welcomed the price cap, saying: 'It's unjustifiable that data roaming can be 50 times more expensive than when at home.' The move comes after the EU last week extended the cap on mobile phone call roaming charges by a further four years, to 2016. However, it comes as a blow to mobile operators who will also have to comply with new regulations on calls and SMS messages. Savings: The cost in euros of making and receiving calls while abroad has fallen slowly since 2009 . The proposals to cut the cost of data roaming are part of plans by Kroes to slash cross-border mobile charges by 2015. And there will be a clause to phase out the price caps before 2016, should the structural measures result in cheaper international calls. Richard Feasey, public policy director at Vodafone, told the Financial Times: 'It's good the Commission is reflecting on new options for regulating the roaming market and has recognised that price caps have major drawbacks.' Last week an EU directive was introduced to force down the cost of making and receiving mobile phone calls while in Europe. EU's Digital Agenda Commissioner Neelie Kroes wants to 'address the lack of competition' The rules mean that the maximum . permitted charge will be no more than 32p per minute, excluding VAT, for . calls made while abroad - down from 35p. It also will cost not more than 10p per minute for calls received while abroad in EU countries. The cost of sending a text message remains at a maximum of 10p while it costs nothing to receive one. The . changes bring the EU a step closer to making sure that within three . years it will be the same price to use a mobile either at home or . abroad. Commissioners have . taken action because network operators are making profits of an . astonishing 200 per cent on calls made in Europe and a staggering 400 . per cent on calls received. The cost of sending a text message remains at a maximum of 10p while it costs nothing to receive one. But despite this, existing rules to prevent bill shocks for using the internet on a mobile while abroad remain weak. Operators . must only apply an automatic 50 Euros or Â£45 cut-off limit on accounts . unless the customer explicitly agrees otherwise, but need not do . anything else. Operators must warn customers when they reach 80 per cent of their limit. The . EU's Digital Agenda Commissioner Neelie Kroes admitted last week that . despite the cuts, a lack of open competition means operators are still . making massive profits on foreign calls and internet use. Still expensive: Consumers arriving in Europe by air, sea or rail will have the cost of using their phone abroad cut but mobile internet prices are still very high . 'These . latest price caps will temporarily reduce retail prices for making and . receiving voice calls when in another EU country during the coming . year,' he said. 'But we have to tackle roaming problems at the root with a long-lasting structural approach. 'The Commission will therefore be coming forward very shortly with comprehensive new proposals for long-term solutions to address the underlying problem of lack of competition in roaming markets.' Making calls: 3p cheaper . Receiving calls: Capped at 10p per minute . Sending Texts: 10p (maximum) Receiving texts: Free . Data roaming (internet): Â£45 limit* . Browsing internet or receiving emails: No more than 81p per megabyte from July 2012, falling to 40p by 2014 . * Unless requested. Compulsory maximum roaming rates were first imposed on mobile network operators four years ago to tackle what the Commission called the 'roaming rip-off'. A legal claim by the networks that the Commission was exceeding its powers failed last year, and rates fell further. Action by Brussels against high roaming charges has been one of the most popular consumer-driven moves by the EU. On average there has been a 60 per cent cut in the maximum charges operators could levy on mobile users making or receiving calls while in another EU country since 2007. Last week's additional price drop means mobile roaming charges are about 75 per cent cheaper on average than they were six years ago when the Commission first urged operators to cut their rates voluntarily. The current roaming rules apply until June 2012 and the European Commission is due to present its plans for the following period next week.","Charges for internet on smartphone or tablet in EU more than halved .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 3:45 PM on 3rd September 2011 . The sister of Rebecca Zahau, the woman found hanging at billionaire Jonah Shacknaiâs home, has repeated her refusal to believe her sister committed suicide after police spelt out the finding of their investigation. Rebecca Zahau, 32, was found dead on July 13, hanging from a second-floor balcony at a historic mansion in suburban Coronado, California belonging to Mr Shacknai, whose son had a tragic fall two days earlier. Before she died a distraught Zahau painted a message in black paint on a door revealed San Diego Country Sheriff Bill Gore, as he said police had concluded the death was suicide not murder. According to Zahau's ex-husband, Neil Nalepa, it read: 'She saved him, can he save her.' Suicide: Rebecca Zahau, right, was found hanging naked at Jonah Shacknai's mansion in Coronado, California . But the lawyer representing her family has said that they do not want police to close the case. 'Rebecca had no history of suicidal tendencies, no psychological . problems and no history of depression,'Â  Anne . Bremner told . RadarOnline. 'The family wants justice. The police have a duty to . fully investigate the case and we donât want them to close the . investigation today. The family does not believe it was a suicide.' Ms Zahauâs sister Snowem Horwath believes her . sister was murdered. 'Becky did not kill herself, someone killed her,' she told RadarOnline. 'Time will reveal who killed Becky.Â  I think I . know who killed my sister.Â  We are not stupid, she never had any . enemies.' The family is calling for a forensic psychiatrist and a . criminal profiler to investigate the case and say the cryptic message in black paint was not Ms Zahau's handwriting. Authorities showed a photo of the balcony over which Rebecca allegedly killed herself, but they covered up the message she painted in black on a door shortly before her death, seen right . Officials revealed yesterday that the paint from the message was still on her hands and on the rope when she died. The fatal fall over a staircase railing of . 6-year-old Max Shacknai, Jonah's son two days before Rebecca's death, was ruled an accident. He was . found not breathing and with no pulse by Rebecca at the bottom of the . stairs after she heard a noise and came to look. She was the only adult at home at the time. Authorities said the last call to . Zahau's voicemail before her death had delivered the message that the . boy was in grave condition and would likely die, as he did six days later. The findings in the deaths followed a lengthy investigation. 'Were . these deaths the result of criminal conduct? Was Max's death a . homicide? The answer is no,' San Diego County Sheriff Bill Gore told a . news conference. . This is a diagram shown Friday of how investigators say Max accidentally fell his death . Max was revealed to have broken his spinal chord in his fall, and was not breathing and had no pulse when he was found . 'It was a tragic accident. Was . Rebecca's death a homicide? Again the answer is no. It was a suicide ... These deaths were not the result of any criminal acts.' There . was no evidence of foul play, sexual assault or a struggle, authorities . said. She was alive when she went over the balcony and she died by . hanging. There were no alcohol or drugs in her system. She died at about 3 a.m and was found at 6:45 a.m. by Jonah's brother, who cut her down and called 911. When Zahau's naked body was found . hanging from the mansion's balcony with her ankles and wrists bound, . investigators were quick to say they weren't ruling out suicide . On Friday they showed a video re-enactment of how someone could bind their own hands. Authorities also said on Friday that Zahau had not been happy for some time and had recently lost weight. DNA from the rope around her neck that was tied to a bed footboard, and foot impressions on balcony dust were also tied to Zahau, investigators said. Someone left a voice mail message with Zahau at 12:50 a.m. the morning her body was found indicating that Max's condition had taken a serious turn and he wasn't expected to survive, Gore said. One witness who authorities declined to identify said Zahau appeared depressed in January, Gore said. Investigators discovered a lengthy 'journal' stored in her phone that also indicated she was unhappy. 'Max was an extraordinarily loving, . happy, talented, and special little boy. He brought joy to everyone who . knew him... Rebecca too was a wonderful and unique person' Jonah Shacknai . 'This type of a suicide â its unusual but I don't think it's unprecedented,' Gore said. All the DNA found on the binding and rope and fingerprints on the paint also belonged to her. Jonah Shacknai released a statement expressing his sadness. 'While the investigation is over, the emptiness and sadness in our hearts will remain forever,' Shacknai said. 'Max . was an extraordinarily loving, happy, talented, and special little boy. He brought joy to everyone who knew him, and we will miss him . desperately. 'Rebecca too was a wonderful and unique person who will always have a special place in my heart,' he added. Rebecca's sister Mary Zahau-Loehner revealed . the news that the death had been ruled a suicide late Wednesday, but said she found investigators unconvincing when they broke . their findings to her. Marriage plans: Shacknai reportedly told friends he wanted to spend the rest of his life with Rebecca, who had quit her job to spend more time with Shacknai and his children . It doesn't add up,â she said, after . she was visited on Wednesday at her home in in St Joseph, Missouri, by . investigators who told her their theory. âNothing adds up.â Ms Zahau was Jonah Shacknai's girlfriend of two years and Max was his son from a marriage that ended in divorce in 2008. Ms Zahau-Loehner said she spoke with her . sister the night before her body was found and she gave no hint that she . planned to take her life. She said she planned to bring Mr . Shacknai breakfast and a change of clothes the next morning to the . hospital where his son was being treated. Ms Zahau also told her sister that she would call her parents in the morning on the way to the hospital. She emailed another sister in Germany to say she would be updating throughout the next day. 'We've obviously had an extraordinarily difficult time. We have undertaken some tragedies, some losses that one couldn't imagine experiencing in a lifetime' Jonah Shacknai . âToo detailed planning for someone who's planning to end their life that night,â Ms Zahau-Loehner said. When Max fell down the stairs, Ms Zahau was at home with a 13-year-old girl who was related to her, authorities say. He was hospitalised after paramedics found the boy wasn't breathing, his neck was broken and he did not have a pulse. Two days later, Mr Shacknai's brother, Adam, called 911 to report that Ms Zahau appeared to be dead, investigators said. The brother was staying in a mansion guesthouse. Jonah Shacknai was not at home as he was at his son's hospital bedside . The home, known as the Spreckels . mansion, is one of the more storied properties in Coronado, a small . suburb of multimillion-dollar homes on the tip of a peninsula across a . bay from downtown San Diego. The home has unobstructed beach views . and sits near Coronado's main street, which is lined with palm trees and . upscale boutiques. Mr Shacknai bought the mansion in March 2007, when it was assessed at $12.75million.

The home was built in 1908 and named . for its original owner, John D. Spreckels, who also owned newspapers the . San Diego Union and San Diego Tribune. Mr Shacknai founded Medicis .

Medicis makes acne treatments Solodyn and Ziana and facial wrinkle treatment Restylane and Dysport, a competitor of Botox. Last year, the company earned $123million on $700million in revenue. Mr Shacknai has two children with his first wife, Kimberly. Max was his only child with his second wife, Dina. He told Medicis investors in August . that he was planning to resume his daily routine of showing up at the . office as soon as school resumed for his children in Arizona. âWe've obviously had an . extraordinarily difficult time,â he said. âWe have undertaken some . tragedies, some losses that one couldn't imagine experiencing in a . lifetime.â Ms Zahau, a native of Myanmar, was an . ophthalmic technician at Horizon Eye Specialists & Lasik Center in . the Phoenix area from April 2008 to December 2010.

It happened after concerned staff who had seen pictures issued by police of Graeme Jarman, 47, raised the alarm when they suspected he was inside the building in Filey, North Yorkshire. Jarman became the subject of a nationwide manhunt after detectives discovered the body of 77-year-old Judith Richardson at her home in Hexham,Northumberland, on August 19. Arrested: Graeme Jarman, left, is being questioned over the murder of Judith Richardson . It is believed her attacker killed her with a hammer before stealing her handbag. Jarman disappeared from his home in Consett, Co Durham, two days before Miss Richardson was found. Durham Police appealed for him to come forward on August 23. Miss Richardsonâs handbag was found dumped in a bin outside a charity shop in Newcastle city centre, 25 miles from her house. A passer-by handed it to police who went to her home in an attempt to return it â but instead found her lifeless body. Last Monday, detectives issued CCTV images of Jarman and warned the public not to approach him. Jarman is thought to have changed his appearance in recent days . More than 40 officers from Northumbria, Durham and Cleveland forces worked with colleagues in Dorset, Sussex and Kent after it emerged Jarman regularly visited the areas. Police believe in the week before the murder Jarman lost a considerable amount of money gambling. Northumbria Police said Jarman was detained after staff at a library in Filey alerted officers at 3pm this afternoon. Jarman, shown here on CCTV last week, was believed to have travelled down south but was arrested in North Yorkshire . Yesterday a niece of the victim spoke out to urge anyone with information to contact police. She said: âWe are a very private family and we are finding all of this so horrific. We thank everyone for all the lovely condolences and good wishes that we have received and sincerely thank everyone who has helped the police in any way. âWe would also like to ask everyone to please keep helping the police with any information to assist them in finding whoever is responsible for Judith's devastating death.â Detective Chief Superintendent Neil Adamson said of the arrest: 'I would like to thank the public and the media for their assistance during this investigation. 'It has been their support which has made this arrest possible. 'I would also like to take the opportunity to mention the unwavering support we have received from police forces across the country. 'It is to them, as much as to the officers of Northumbria, Cleveland and Durham I owe my thanks.'",Graeme Jarman had been missing for two weeks but was arrested this afternoon in North Yorkshire .

Authorities issued warnings about waves pounding the central California coast that left a swimmer missing and caused a marijuana smuggling boat to crash onto a beach. Lifeguards conducted dozens of rescues and the massive surf also caused some damage to the Ocean Beach and San Clemente piers.

A high surf advisory was in effect until 5pm Friday after high tide and a winter storm off New Zealand combined to bring waves of up to 10-feet high pounding beaches from San Luis Obispo to San Diego. The powerful surf probably forced a smuggling boat to crash on a Southern California beach where more than 500lb of marijuana washed ashore, authorities said yesterday. California State Parks rangers found the abandoned boat split in half on rocks near Point Mugu northwest of Malibu. Waves reaching 6 to 9ft and 'probably a lot of misjudgment by the cartel operating the boat' led to the crash, said Lindsey Templeton, a superintendent for the park system. 'Obviously they didn't check the surf or they risked it anyway,' he said. Wall of water: A body boarder paddles towards an ominous dark wave hurtling towards the shore at Newport Beach .

"By . Damien Gayle . Last updated at 3:43 PM on 3rd September 2011 . Smiley Culture, who died of a single stab wound while four Met Police officers searched his Surrey home . Police who carried out the raid on the home of Smiley Culture, in which the reggae star allegedly stabbed himself to death, are unlikely to face any charges. Police claim Smiley Culture, real name David Emmanuel, stabbed himself in the heart while officers were searching his home for evidence of drugs trafficking. In a confidential letter leaked to the Guardian, IPCC commissioner Mike Franklin told the singer's family no evidence was found to imply any police misconduct. He said: 'The [IPCC] investigation has identified aspects of the operation which were not satisfactory, and criticisms have been made of some of the officer's actions. 'However, these do not meet the threshold for misconduct under the police misconduct system.' Mr Emmanuel's family have bitterly criticised the Met Police officers involved in the incident, none of whom have been suspended. They are also angry over the IPCC's decision to treat the officers as witnesses rather than suspects, meaning they cannot be forced to answer questions in a formal interview. Mr Emmanuel's family was told that he stabbed himself while making a cup of tea, despite the presence of officers in his home. They . question why the four officers involved in the raid handcuffed Mr . Emmanuel after his fatal injury and want to know why the officer in the . kitchen at the time refused a direct request by the IPCC's lead . investigator to give a formal interview. No justice, no peace: A girl holds a placard on a demonstration questioning the circumstances surrounding the death of Smiley Culture . Shanice McConnachie, Mr Emmanuel's . 17-year-old daughter, told the Guardian: 'Their story just doesn't add . up and until it does, I can't believe that my dad killed himself.' The . only action the officers can now face is if the Met initiates an . 'unsatisfactory performance procedure', which can result in dismissal, . but which the IPCC cannot direct. The teenage daughter of reggae star Smiley Culture has told of her disbelief at the outcome of the IPCC investigation into the death of her father. Shanice McConnachie said her father was a 'calm and spiritual person' who would never have the kind of outburst police say led to his alleged suicide. In an article written for the Guardian newspaper, the 17-year-old told how her father was excited about his life and always working towards the future. 'I can't imagine him decideing to throw his future away, whatever was happening to him at any one moment,' she said. 'Added to all that, he was scared of needles â he hated them â so the idea he would kill himself with a sharp knife seems insane.' Ms McConnachie said her father's death has changed her deeply and left her with sleepless nights. 'Until I get to the bottom of it, I won't know what peace is,' she said. Mr Emmanuel, who was 48, found fame as Smiley Culture with the Eighties hits Cockney Translation and Police Officer. His autobiographical 1984 hit Police Officer tells how he was caught in possession of cannabis but let off when the officer recognised him as a reggae artist. Merlin Emmanuel, Smiley Culture's nephew, to whom the IPCC sent the letter outlining the outcome of its investigation, told the MailOnline he was disappointed but not surprised by the decision. 'If we look historically speaking about the other families [who have lost relatives in police custody] we didn't hold out much hope,' he said. 'We did think that in the particular unique circumstances in which Smiley died at least some officers would be found to have questions to answer.' He was particularly stinging in his criticism of the IPCC, saying the police watchdog 'have no real authority to procure justice for the ordinary citizen.' Since 1990 there have been a total of 940 deaths in police custody, according to the charity Inquest. 'At the end of the day, we would have expected some kind of justice because if they didn't go to his home that morning Smiley would still be here,' the younger Emmanuel said. He added: 'In cases like ours it seems that we just feel like we are up against a great Goliath and we are not equipped to handle them.'","No police officers have submitted to a formal interview .

A nurse has been charged in connection with the death of five patients at Stepping Hill Hospital which is at the centre of a tampering probe, police said tonight. Rebecca Leighton, 27, has been charged with six counts of causing damage with intent to endanger life. She will appear before magistrates in the morning. If found guilty of the offences, the hospital worker faces a potential life sentence. A police investigation was launched after five unexplained deaths at the hospital. A spokesman for Greater Manchester Police said tonight: 'A woman arrested by detectives investigating five deaths at Stepping Hill hospital has been charged. 'Rebecca Leighton, of Heaviley, is charged with six counts under section one of the criminal damage act, causing damage with intent to endanger life or being reckless to whether life is being endangered. 'She is also charged with one count of theft of medicine from Stepping Hill Hospital. 'She is due to appear at Manchester Magistrates' Court on Saturday.' Tonight police named Vera Pearson, 84, as the fifth victim to be linked to the investigation. Derek Weaver, 83, who died yesterday, has also been linked with the investigation. She was not one of the 14 patients police . initially believed had been treated with 36 vials of saline contaminated . with insulin. The pensioner's family said they wanted to be left alone to grieve in peace. Detectives are expected to continue to investigate the case over the coming days.

Denis Livesley, 60, was loading a crashed Volvo onto his recovery truck on a slip road off the M60 when a Volkswagen Golf skidded on ice and hit him . A tow truck driver was mown down by a runaway car only to be left dying in the road - as other motorists drove round him. Denis Livesley, 60, was loading a crashed Volvo onto his vehicle on a motorway when a Volkswagen Golf skidded on ice and ploughed into him. But instead of stopping to help, drivers in other cars swerved round Mr Livesley as he lay face down on the inside lane of a slip road on the M60 near Sale, Greater Manchester. According to witnesses, some drivers had so little regard for the dying man, they even edged their cars past the Golf which had hit him because they did not want to be held up. Mr Livesley, from Oldham, who once worked as a roadie for Elton John and Sting was eventually attended to by passers-by including a doctor and then an ambulance crew but was pronounced dead on arrival at Trafford General Hospital. The shocking 'walk on by' scenario emerged as a jury returned a verdict of unlawful killing at an inquest into Mr Livesley's death which occurred in December 2009. Laura Warmoth, who was travelling to work, told the Stockport hearing: 'It was horrific. I couldn't believe my eyes as I witnessed motorists manoeuvring around him and driving off without stopping. 'They had little or no regard for the man. It appeared all they were bothered about was getting past and getting on their journey. 'They were swerving past the tailgate of the Golf. It was like a game. I found it very disturbing.' Mrs Warmoth said she stopped her car at an angle to block the traffic and then went over to Mr Livesley who was said to be motionless. Instead of stopping to help, drivers in other cars swerved round Mr Livesley as he lay face down on the inside lane of a slip road on the M60 near Sale, Greater Manchester . Mr Livesley, a grandfather of eight, had been loading the Volvo, which had crashed into a barrier due to the weather conditions, onto his truck near junction 6 when he was hit by the Volkswagen. Police had earlier attended the crash and advised the Volvo driver, Paul Harrington, to stand behind the crash barriers but had left after seeing Highways Agency officers arrive. Highways Agency officer Reece Newell . told the court he and his colleague Nicola Jones had twice asked if Mr . Harrington would like them to stay but he had declined. 'We . also offered him a foil blanket and told him there was a telephone box . he could call and we would be back within ten to 15 minutes. There was . no reason for us to stay at the scene,' he added. The . VW driver, Sophie Wilkinson, 23, a veterinary student from Bolton, was . twice interviewed by police but no action was taken. She denied having . driven over snow-covered chevron markings that separate Junction 7 from . the motorway network. Mr Livesley drove stars such as Sting and Elton John, right, across Europe delivering their stage equipment . But lawyers will now reopen the files after Coroner John Pollard asked the Crown Prosecution Service to review the decision. Mr Pollard said he also would write to the chief constable of Greater Manchester Police and to the Highways Agency asking them to look at their protocols and ensure the safety of recovery drivers who are called to pick up cars following motorway crashes. He said officers from both organisations who were called to the scene had obeyed their organisations' procedures. But he added: 'It does seem to me that, in the prevailing weather conditions, the emergency services ought to have considered not just the safety of the driver whose car had been involved in a crash but also the safety of anyone who is required to recover the driver of that vehicle.' As well as working for GM Recovery Limited, Mr Livesley drove stars such as Pink Floyd, Elton John and Sting across Europe delivering their stage equipment. Nadia Kerr, a partner at Pannone . solicitors, which is to file a civil action on behalf of Mr Livesley's . family against the VW driver, said: 'The family would welcome a decision . from the CPS that they will now prosecute. 'We . expect to have a response from the CPS in a few weeks. The situation . was the police and the Highways Agency had responded to the car that had . spun off the road. Denis was clearing that damaged vehicle when he was . killed. 'When he got . there only the damaged vehicle and the driver were at the scene. There . is currently no protocol in place as to whether the police should have . stayed at the scene for the protection of recovery drivers. 'We . don't know what the reason is for the unlawful killing verdict. We . asked the coroner what the background was to the verdict but the jury . didn't record it in the inquisition so there is no explanation for it.' Mr Livesley also worked for Pink Floyd. His widow, Wendy, said that her late husband 'got to know quite a few of the celebrities, who all really valued the work he did for them' Mr Livesley's widow, Wendy, 38, said after the verdict: 'The whole family has been absolutely devastated by Denis's death. At least the inquest provided answers as to precisely what happened on the day Denis died. 'We now want lessons to be learned from the mistakes that were made so that no-one else doing the job Denis died dies in the same circumstances.' 'Denis lived for his work and it was typical of him that he went to this job when really his area of work was really dealing with the recovery of heavy goods vehicles. He probably went because he knew he'd have been able to help but his dedication brought about his death. 'Denis got to know quite a few of the celebrities, who all really valued the work he did for them. 'He was married before to someone also called Wendy who sadly died from cancer and when he got the call on tour in Europe to say she had become critically ill, Sting paid for him to be flown home immediately. That's how much people thought of him. 'He was so kind and generous, once when he was in Bosnia just after the troubles there, he came home with no shoes! He'd given them to a Bosnian who he said 'needed them more than me'. That was my Denis; he'd do anything for anyone.'",Victim once worked as roadie for stars such as Elton John and Sting .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 3:11 PM on 20th June 2011 . Adding fuel to the fiery debate over immigration in Arizona, U.S. Senator and former presidential candidate John McCain has blamed illegal immigrants for starting some of the wildfires that have torched hundreds of thousands of acres in his state. Mr McCain said at a press conference Saturday: 'There is substantial evidence that some of these fires have been caused by people who have crossed our border illegally'. The Republican senator added: 'They have set fires because they want to to signal others, they have set firs to keep warm, and they have set fires to divert law enforcement agencies from them. 'The answer to that part of the problem is to get a secure border'. Fanning the flames: Senator John McCain blames illegal immigrants for starting the fires that rage across Arizona, though he did not point to any specific evidence . Burning: The Monument Fire burns a hillside just south of Sierra Vista, Arizona . Mr McCain did not say what evidence he had for those charges, or what the source was. As a result, Latino civil rights advocates have criticized his statements. Randy Parraz, a civil rights activist who ran unsuccessfully against McCain as a Democrat in 2010, told CNN: 'It's easier to fan the flames of intolerance, especially in Arizona'. Mr Parraz said Mr McCain 'should know better' than to make such a 'careless and reckless' accusation without presenting any facts. While firefighters battle five wildfires that have burned 732,427 acres in Arizona, the causes of the blazes are under investigation. Mr Parraz said. 'People are looking for someone to blame', especially one of Arizona's 'most vulnerable populations'. Meanwhile, about 3,000 people from 1,700 homes were evacuated . Sunday as the Monument blaze - burning for a week - picked up speed with winds . gusted up to 60 mph, Cochise County sheriff's spokeswoman Carol Capas . said late Sunday night. Up in smoke: A home burns from the Monument Fire near Sierra Vista, Arizona on Sunday, June 19, 2011 . Tragic: Pete Tunstall leans on his rake while at his home that burned along the south side of Ramsey Road near State Route 92 . Ms Capas told the AP: 'Winds pushed fire across Highway 92, making run so . fast and so hot that the danger to citizens in the path was . significant'. The flames raced down a mountain and into a heavily . populated area, forcing crews to abandon their lines and set up in new . spots. 'The fire crews are doing an amazing job, trying to get in front of it', she said. Sunday's evacuations brought the total number to . about 10,000 people from 4,300 homes forced to flee flames of the . Monument fire, she said. Some residences were destroyed Sunday, adding to the . 44 already reported, but fire officials still don't have an exact . number, Capas said. Among the destroyed structures was a popular Mexican . restaurant. There have been no serious injuries. She said evacuees have been staying with friends and relatives, at three evacuation shelters, and at local inns. Debbie . Schmidlin told the Arizona Daily Star: 'This is horrible. This is a nightmare'. She said she was evacuated twice . in the past week from homes east and west of Highway 92. 'If this fire gets there, I'm leaving Arizona', she said as she watched from behind police lines two miles north of her home. Flames are seen over homes in Sierra Vista, Arizona. The biggest wildfire in state history is closing in on a half million acres burned . Battle: Firefighters had to battle high winds over the weekend, which spread the fires . Escape: Fire trucks flee the flames near South Andalusian Way after the fire jumped State Route 92 near Sierra Vista, Arizona . Mario Morales, who has a mobile home on land he owns . on the east side of 92, was philosophical. 'You just gotta accept it', . he told the newspaper. 'There is no stopping this monster'. Winds had diminished by late Sunday and were projected to reach just 10 mph Monday. That would make battling the blazes easier. Before the winds spread the flames earlier in the . day, the blaze was reported 27 per cent contained at about 21,000 acres . or nearly 33 square miles. Meanwhile, the massive Wallow fire that has been . burning in eastern Arizona for three weeks kept about 200 residents of . Luna, N.M., under an evacuation order for a second day. A containment line that had held through days of high . winds was breached Saturday and the fire raced toward town before . shifting winds steered it around the community. It was moving to the . north into an area of scattered ranches late Sunday afternoon, fire . information officer Michael Puentes said. Despite the evacuation order for Luna, about half the town's residents remained in town. Catron County Undersheriff Ian Fletcher said: 'If the fire comes back around or things change where they have to get . out, we still have an egress point, so we will still escort them out of . town'.

Fire crews watch the wildfire as it crosses Arizona 92 around 1 p.m. Thursday afternoon, June 16, 2011, after it burned through Stump Canyon area near Hereford . Evacuation orders for Luna came on the same day that some other . residents displaced by the fire that began May 29 were allowed to return . home. Residents of Alpine, Ariz., were allowed to return to their homes . Saturday morning after being forced out for more than two weeks, while . residents of the resort town of Greer will be allowed to return home . late Monday morning. The Wallow blaze has consumed nearly 800 square miles, a little more . than 511,000 acres, and more than 3,500 firefighters were trying to stop . its advance. It is larger than a 2002 fire that burned 732 square miles . and destroyed 491 buildings that had been the largest in state history. Despite its size, the latest fire has destroyed just 32 homes and four . rental cabins. Containment rose to 51 per cent Sunday. The Wallow fire, which is burning up much of the Apache-Sitgreaves National . Forest, is the largest of several wildfires burning in spots across the . southwestern United States. â¢ In Texas, firefighters working to contain a massive wildfire in East . Texas were expecting unusually hot and windy weather Monday, a day after . several blazes broke out across the state and destroyed more than three . dozen homes. Hundreds of people were told to evacuate after fires swept . through eastern and central parts of the state. â¢ A new wildfire ignited Sunday in northcentral Arizona that officials . said could threaten powerlines running to Phoenix as well as some . scattered ranches in coming days. Eric Nietel, spokesman for the Show . Low fire department, said late Sunday night that the blaze, about 40 . miles northeast of Payson, had burned about 500 acres. â¢ A fire burning on both sides of the New Mexico-Colorado border outside . of Raton, N.M. was 80 per cent contained and evacuations had all been . lifted. The fire apparently was started June 12 by engine exhaust from . an all-terrain vehicle trespassing on railroad property. â¢ Another wildfire in Cochise County, Arizona, called Horseshoe Two was 75 . per cent contained after charring about 210,000 acres - nearly 330 . square miles. It has destroyed 23 structures since it started May 8. â¢ A fire burning 9 miles north of Santa Fe, New Mexico, had burned about 900 . acres by Sunday morning and was being driven northeast into the Pecos . Wilderness, U.S. Forest Service spokeswoman Alberta Maez said. The fire . broke out Saturday and was not threatening any structures. â¢ Authorities in southern New Mexico were looking for 'persons of . interest' as they searched for the cause of a fire that burned several . homes in the wooded community of Ruidoso.","Mr McCain blamed illegals without pointing to specific evidence .

"By . Robert Verkaik and Emily Hewett . Last updated at 11:00 AM on 14th August 2011 . The acting head of the Metropolitan Police has clashed with the Prime Minister over a suggestion that the Army could be deployed to quell rioting in London. Tim Godwin told David Cameron he would agree to troops on the streets of London only after âevery one of my officers and borough commanders are standing on the police front lineâ. The row happened last Tuesday morning in a meeting in Downing Street between the two men and Home Secretary Theresa May. Met chief Tim Godwin, left, is reluctant to agree to troops on the streets of London and Sir Hugh Orde, right, president of the Association of Chief Police Officers, has openly questioned the appointment of former US police chief, Bill Bratton . It took place shortly before a meeting of Cobra, the Governmentâs national security committee. News of Mr Godwinâs intervention comes after a series of disagreements between the Government and the police over the handling of the riots. Last week Mr Godwin implicitly attacked the Prime Minister when he criticised politicians âwho werenât thereâ for making judgments about Scotland Yardâs response to the violence. It is understood that Mr Cameron was keen to explore a number of options and contingency plans as the riots spread across the capital. One of these was bringing in the Army. But later at the Cobra meeting, Mr Godwin repeated his objections to using soldiers. Last week the Prime Minister told MPs . that âfar too fewâ officers had been deployed when the trouble started . and that the police had initially treated the violence âtoo much as a . public order issueâ rather than as one of criminality. His . comments have antagonised senior police officers. Sir Hugh Orde, the . president of the Association of Chief Police Officers, dismissed . politiciansâ claims that Ministers had ordered the tougher approach that . ended the violence. Hitting back: The acting Metropolitan Police Commissioner has repeated his objections to using soldiers . Last week the Prime Minister said that 'far too few' officers had been deployed when the trouble started and that the police had initially treated the violence 'too much as a public order issue' rather than as one of criminality . He said that the police had deployed reinforcements to trouble-hit districts, adding that the return of politicians to Westminster was âan irrelevanceâ. He later expressed his concerns with the appointment of Bill Bratton, the Independent on Sunday reported: 'I am not sure I want to learn about gangs from an area of America that has 400 of them. It seems to me, if you've got 400 gangs, then you're not being very effective. If you look at the style of policing in the States, and their levels of violence, they are fundamentally different from here. 'What i suggested to the Home Secretary is a more sensible approach, maybe to look across far wider styles of policing; and, more usefully, at European styles - they, like us, are bound by the European Convention. My sense is, when we've done that, we will find the British model is probably the top.' By Friday, the Prime Minister was trying to mend relations with the police and said that police commanders, not politicians, were in charge of the response to the riots. âClearly there was a need for more [police] on the streets,â said Mr Cameron. âThere was a need to change tactics and I think it is right that police took those decisions.â Downing Street said last night that it would not comment on a private meeting between the Prime Minister and the head of the Metropolitan Police.","Met Chief criticises politicians âwho werenât thereâ for making .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 9:19 AM on 28th June 2011 . Homeowners in Corby in the East Midlands are most at risk of having their home repossessed, a studyÂ  of the country's reposessions hostpots found today. The Northamptonshire town has the highest proportion of homeowners who have been issued with a possession order for their home over the last 12 months, according to the research. It was closely followed by Barking and Dagenham and Newham in London; Knowsley, Merseyside and Thurrock, Essex. Scroll down for the full list of repossession hotspots . Struggling owners: A map showing the repossession hotspots across England . The report warned that the figures . reflected a need for homeowners across the country to prepare for higher . mortgage repayments when interest rates rise as expected later this . year. A possession . order is an advanced stage of the repossession process which means a . homeowner is at serious risk of losing their home. Corby was found to have a rate of possession orders nine times the higher than the lowest rate in West Dorset. The . study by the housing and homelessness charity identified 65 of 324 . local authorities as repossession hotspots - most of them areas of high . unemployment. High . concentrations of repossession hotposts were found in the Tyneside . areas surrounding Yorkshire, Leeds and Liverpool, the Wash, South East . London and the Kent and Essex coastal towns. The . average rate of unemployment in the local authorities with the highest . rates stood at 9.6 per cent, compared to 5.3 per cent in those with the least. At-risk: Homeowners in Corby, above, are nine times more likely to have their home repossessed than thos ein Dorset . And . unemployment has risen, on average, by 3.3 per cent over the last three years . in the most at risk areas, compared to a 1.4 per cent increase in the lowest, . Shelter said. The study also identified clusters of local . authorities - Tyneside, Kent coastal towns (Thurrock, Medway, Swale) and . The Wash (South Holland, Fenland, Peterborough) - among those in the . highest risk group. It also highlighted a red 'ribbon' of . repossessions across northern England from the Mersey in the west to the . Humber estuary in the east. The results were based on analysis of the latest Ministry of Justice figures on the rates of claims leading to possession orders per 1,000 households for each local authority, published in May 2011. Campbell Robb, chief executive of Shelter, said: 'This research paints a frightening picture of repossession hotspots across the country where homeowners are literally on the brink of losing the roof over their head. 'We know only too well that the combined pressures of high inflation, increased living costs and stagnant wages are really taking a toll on people. 'All it takes is one thing like job loss to tip people over the edge and into the spiral of debt and repossession and ultimately homelessness.'

"By . Daniel Martin and Kirsty Walker . Last updated at 8:59 AM on 22nd June 2011 . More than a million public service workers are poised to launch the âfight of their livesâ with a âsustainedâ series of strikes to oppose cuts to their pensions. The leader of Britainâs largest union yesterday issued a defiant âcall to armsâ and urged members to prepare for a rolling programme of strikes over the autumn designed to âweakenâ the Coalition. Dave Prentis, general secretary of public sector union Unison, said his members would co-ordinate action with 11 local government unions and 19 health unions. Waging war: Unison General Secretary Dave Prentis issued a 'call to arms' to his one million members while speaking at the conference in Manchester today . Delegates at Unisonâs annual . conference in Manchester are today expected to vote for a strike ballot . to be held across its 1.2million membership. It includes nurses and . council staff such as dinner ladies and social workers. Public sector pensions are far more generous than those for private sector workers. The âautumn of discontentâ is being . threatened over Coalition plans for public sector workers to pay more . into their pension scheme and receive less on retirement. Mr Prentis revealed that Unison had built up a Â£20million fighting fund for the action. In a keynote speech at the . conference, he said: âIf this Government fails to heed our warnings, to . negotiate in good faith, I say to David Cameron, âYou ainât seen nothing . yet.â âWe will strike to defend our . pensions: a campaign of strike action without precedent. Our . preparations are well advanced, but there is more to do.â Symbolic dispute: Miners march during the 1984 strike. After a year of action, however, they ran out of money as public support shrank . He told delegates: âStrike action . will need to be sustained. The fight of our lives may be an overused . cliche, but that is what this is.â Nick Clegg warned his Tory colleagues to stop âbristling for a fightâ with the unions. The Deputy Prime Minister said he . would stand in the way of anyone attempting to âturn the clockâ back to . the 1980s and called for ânegotiation not confrontationâ. Mr Prentis was confident that ordinary people would not turn . their backs on the public sector, adding that many in the health service . and elsewhere were earning a âpittanceâ. Support: Members vote on a motion during the annual Unison conference. They have been told to 'prepare for action' that could see a wave of strikes . Speaking at the Unison . conference in Manchester, he said that the extra money being taken from . workers was being used to pay for the deficit and would not go to their . pension funds. Unison president Angela Lynes also told the union's annual conference . that public sector workers were facing âunprecedentedâ attacks on pay, . jobs and pensions. She told delegates at the conference in . Manchester that workers were under âassaultâ on a number of fronts, . adding: âOn pensions, the Government is determined to hit us with a . triple whammy - they want us to pay more, work longer and then get less . when we retire.â Mrs Lynes, 41, who works for Glasgow City . Council, said the economy was being âdragged backâ to recession and . accused Chancellor George Osborne of refusing to accept the need for a . Plan B, even though Plan A âwasn't workingâ. 'This is more sick society, than Big Society' She . continued: âThere is a refusal to learn from the pain experienced by . our sisters and brothers in Greece, Portugal and Ireland, where . austerity has simply driven the economy into ever-deeper crisis. âThe effect is felt every day by real people. Unemployment is huge, homelessness is on the rise, and spiralling inflation has meant that the poorest are once again the hardest hit. âOne of the ways the Government thinks it can save cash is by parcelling as many of our public services off to the private sector as possible. âThis is despite the warnings we've had in recent weeks from the appalling conditions at the private hospital in Bristol, and from the fact that more than 30,000 elderly people face huge uncertainty about whether they will be turfed out on to the streets if Southern Cross goes bust. âBut these failures have not been taken on board - quite the opposite. The Government now wants to do the same with the NHS in England and other key public services. This is more sick society than Big Society.â Unison members working in local government have already taken industrial action in protest at cuts to jobs and services, and Mr Prentis has said 1.3million workers could be balloted for strikes later in the year to defend their pensions. Mr Prentis today repeated his warning of strikes later in the year if there is no deal on pensions, saying that the action would be âindefiniteâ. The defeat of the miners in their 1984 strike was a seminal event in industrial history and is credited with helping to hasten the decline of UK trade unions. Like todayâs public sector workers, Britainâs 300,000 miners back then were paid by the state, which owned the coal industry. It has since been privatised. The dispute pitted Conservative Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher against equally resolute union leader Arthur Scargill, who she blamed for bringing down the previous Tory government. Struggle: Mine union leader Arthur Scargill vowed to destroy the government of MrsThatcher, who, blamed him for bringing down the last Tory administration . In return, Scargill vowed to not only stop planned pit closures, but also âroll back the years of Thatcherismâ â which, like today, had seen a massive decline in public spending. The miners represented Britainâs strongest union and so, when they downed tools in March 1984, the stage was set for a battle that would make or break either the Government or trade unionism. Ultimately, the Government won for three reasons. Firstly, it had anticipated a strike and secretly built up stockpiles of coal in the years since its election in 1979. This meant the miners, despite being highly organised, were unable to disrupt industry in the same way as they had in 1974, when power shortages led to Edward Heathâs government introducing a three-day week. Secondly, the miners failed to maintain public support. They received a raft of donations at the beginning. Conflict: The strike pitted miners against thousands of police officers . But, by the end, as violence ensued and allegations of the strike being illegal intensified, people lost interest in backing the unionâs members. Thirdly, because the strike dragged on so long, the union ran out of cash and member were dragged into poverty. The trickle of miners returning to work by the autumn had become a flood by the March 1985, when the strike was finally called off. When Unison General Secretary Dave Prentis said his members âwill not be starved back like the minersâ, this scenario is what he means. The union is therefore hopeful that it can maintain public support, have enough cash to bankroll industrial action and ensure that it has enough leverage against the Coalition Government to win. If they lose, union bosses fear a new wave of privatisations and public sector reforms like those witnessed after the 1984 strike.",Unison boss Dave Prentis tells members to 'prepare for action' and warns Coalition: 'You ain't seen nothing yet'
"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 10:54 AM on 4th July 2011 . Price battle: Dutch EU Commissioner Neelie Kroes (pictured) says that mobile networks are making profits of up to 400 per cent on calls abroad . The slow destruction of the great European mobile phone 'roaming rip-off' continues today with call charges set to be slashed again for consumers. From today it will be 3p per minute cheaper to make a call while abroad, and it will cost no more than 10 per minute to receive a call. The EU has said it would like to see differences in the cost of phone use at home and abroad to disappear altogether by 2015. The changes bring the EU a step closer to making sure that within three years it will be the same price to use a mobile either at home or abroad. Commissioners have taken action because network operators are making profits of an astonishing 200 per cent on calls made in Europe and a staggering 400 per cent on calls received. From today the maximum permitted charge people will pay must be no more than 32p per minute, excluding VAT, for calls made while abroad - down from 35p. The rules mean it will also be no more than 10p per minute for calls received while abroad in EU countries. The cost of sending a text message remains at a maximum of 10p while it costs nothing to receive one. But despite this, existing rules to prevent bill shocks for using the internet on a mobile while abroad remain weak. Operators must only apply an automatic 50 Euros or Â£45 cut-off limit on accounts unless the customer explicitly agrees otherwise, but need not do anything else. Operators must warn customers when they reach 80 per cent of their limit. The EU's Digital Agenda Commissioner Neelie Kroes admitted today that despite the cuts, a lack of open competition means operators are still making massive profits on foreign calls and internet use. Savings: The cost in euros of making and receiving calls while abroad has fallen slowly since 2009 . Still expensive: Consumers arriving in Europe by air, sea or rail will have the cost of using their phone abroad cut but mobile internet prices are still very high . 'These . latest price caps will temporarily reduce retail prices for making and . receiving voice calls when in another EU country during the coming . year,' he said. 'But we have to tackle roaming problems at the root with a long-lasting structural approach. 'The Commission will therefore be coming forward very shortly with comprehensive new proposals for long-term solutions to address the underlying problem of lack of competition in roaming markets.' Making calls: 3p cheaper . Receiving calls: Capped at 10p per minute . Sending Texts: 10p max . Receiving texts: Free . Data roaming (internet): Â£45 limit* . * Unless requested. Compulsory maximum roaming rates were first imposed on mobile network operators four years ago to tackle what the Commission called the 'roaming rip-off'. A legal claim by the networks that the Commission was exceeding its powers failed last year, and rates fell further. Action by Brussels against high roaming charges has been one of the most popular consumer-driven moves by the EU. On average there has been a 60 per cent cut in the maximum charges operators could levy on mobile users making or receiving calls while in another EU country since 2007. Tomorrow's additional price drop means mobile roaming charges are about 75 per cent cheaper on average than they were six years ago when the Commission first urged operators to cut their rates voluntarily. The current roaming rules apply until June 2012 and the European Commission is due to present its plans for the following period next week.","Charges drop to 32p per minute, down from 35p .

Arrested bride: Bernadette Catan-Keeler was arrested on Sunday morning for allegedly beating and biting her husband just hours after they were married . Michael Lohan's ex-girlfriend has been arrested for assaulting her new husband just hours after they were married. Bernadette Catan-Keeler is accused of attacking her new husband Michael Keeler and biting his shoulder. She was arrested Sunday morning in Point Lighthouse, Florida, and charged with domestic battery. According to the Orlando Sentinel, Mr . Keeler told police his new bride attacked him at a hotel and then later . at their home in Lighthouse Point. At the end of March, Lohan - father of troubled starlet Lindsay Lohan - told RadarOnline.com that he had started dating Bernadette, who he said was a nurse he had met at the beach in Florida. He told the website she was a 'down to earth person who hates tabloids!' He added: 'She is smart, doesn't drink or smoke and is in great shape'. This despite the fact that one of the photos Mr Lohan posted online of the couple shows the woman holding what appears to be a pack of cigarettes. Police say the Keelers got married on Saturday, then stayed that night at the W hotel in Fort Lauderdale. The happy new couple went to a nightclub to celebrate, but things quickly turned sour. Mr Keeler told police he saw his new wife dancing with another man, so he left the nightclub and returned to the hotel. He said his wife followed him back shortly after, and that she was drunk. He claimed she then pushed him and bit him on his left shoulder. Mr Keeler said he drove home to the house in Lighthouse Point he shared with Mrs Catan-Keeler. When she got there, she allegedly ripped off his shirt, threw water at him and bit him on his right arm. Same woman? In March, Michael Lohan posted this picture to Twitter of himself with Bernadette, who appears to be Mrs Catan-Keeler. He said she 'doesn't smoke or drink', though she is holding cigarettes . At around 8:30 a.m. Sunday, two police officers approached the house after getting a 911 call from there. The officers said they saw a shirtless Mike Keeler through a window, holding a cellphone and holding down his wife, who was yelling for help. Mrs Catan-Keeler allegedly claimed the bite mark on her husband's shoulder came from kinky play, while the bite mark on his arm was delivered after he pushed her into a wall. Mr Keeler has said he doesn't want his wife to go to jail, and he appeared at her bond hearing Monday to ask for leniency. He said she may have been under the influence of drugs. It's unclear if Mrs Catan-Keeler is actually a nurse. Her bond was set at $4,500. 'Finally a down to earth person who hates tabloids!' Mr Lohan said. He also told reporters he had met her on the beach in Florida . Broward County Judge John 'Jay' Hurley said: 'For newlyweds, this is not starting things off on the right foot, for sure. 'I hope this is a small bump in the road and you two can iron it all out and have a nice long life together'. In March, Michael Lohan had his own trouble with the law, even before he posted steamy pictures online of him and then-Miss Catan. Mr Lohan was arrested in West Hollywood, California after a previous girlfriend, Kate Major, filed a police report against him, claiming he'd assaulted her. The Los Angeles District Attorney filed a misdemeanor charge of 'inflicting injury on a Cohabitant' against him.","Bernadette Besario Catan-Keeler charged .

The body of Engram Lamar Crenshaw, 37, from Katy, Texas, was pulled out of the pool at the home of Houston Texan Antonio Smith. Police were called to the $1million, five-acre property at around 9.30am on Sunday morning after fellow guests had found the dead man.

Fort Bend County sheriffâs spokesman Bob Haenel said an autopsy has been ordered. It is likely to be carried out on Monday. Mr Smith, 29, advertised the pool party several times on Twitter, saying: âHot and sunny out at 94's paradise ranch cowboy boots ninja mask and speedo's.' Law enforcement officials said that about 100 people attended the party, and 25 of them stayed at the house overnight. The victim was reportedly last seen alive at about 2am. Mr Haenel said: 'All I know is they had a party last night and they found a guy at the bottom of the pool this morning.' Captain James Burger from the Sheriff's Office said: 'There were no abrasions and no evidence of physical injuries to his body.' 'He was not dressed to be swimming in the pool, I can say that,' he added, according to USA Today. 'Apparently he stayed out there by himself. In the morning, when people woke up and went outside, they discovered him in the pool.' Mr Smithâs home is located just north of Richmond, a suburb of Houston. As well as a swimming pool, it has a man-made lake at the front. He is about to begin his third season with the Texans. In a statement to the Chronicle, the team said: 'We're aware of the situation. We're gathering facts and will have no further comment at this time.' The team is scheduled to open their season on September 11 against the Indianapolis Colts. The Texans signed Smith in 2009 on a five-year, $35 million contract that included a $12.5 million signing bonus. He played five years with the Arizona Cardinals before joining the Texans.

"By . Jacqui Goddard . Last updated at 7:05 PM on 4th July 2011 . Casey Anthonyâs six-week murder trial finally rested today as jurors were sent away to decide whether her two-year-old daughter was the victim of an accidental drowning that she covered up out of fear and grief, or was brutally murdered by a 'pathological liar' who wanted to live free and party. Judge Belvin Perry dispatched the jury in Orlando, Florida, to consider their verdict after the state delivered an emotionally stirring rebuttal to the defenceâs closing arguments, telling the panel of seven men and five woman that Caylee Anthony died in June 2008 at the hands of 'the most well documented liar ever seen in a courtroom.' Anthony scowled, shook her head and at times mouthed her objections as prosecutors Jeff Ashton and Linda Drane-Burdick closed out their assertion that Caylee was suffocated deliberately by her mother and tossed in the woods to rot. Pensive: Casey Anthony listens to the prosecution's rebuttal on the last day of arguments in her murder trial . Her decomposed remains were found in . December 2008 with duct tape over her skull, where her nose and mouth . would have been. The defenceâs suggestions that her grandfather George . Anthony put it there while disposing of her body was 'laughable'Â  and . 'oh so predictable,' jurors were told. 'Accusing others of lying is classic . Casey Anthony. When Casey Anthony wants to turn attention away from . herself, she accuses others,' said Ms Drane Burdick. 'A lie told . convincingly is still a lie.' Defence attorney Jose Baez told . jurors during closing arguments yesterday that Cayleeâs death was an . 'accident that snowballed out of control' after Caylee clambered alone . into the swimming pool at her home in Orlando, Florida. Anthony was an 'amazing mom' who was afraid of how to handle it and 'made some bad decisions.' 'She should have called police. She . shouldnât have attempted to block it out. She should have reported her . death,' he said. 'But to paint Casey Anthony as a slut, as a party girl, . as a girl who lies, has nothing to do with how Caylee died.' 'Absurd': Prosecutor Jeff Ashton rejected the defence's claim that Caylee drowned in a pool in his final rebuttal . Family: George and Cindy Anthony, parents of Casey Anthony, leave court after the jury was sent out . Ms Drane-Burdick countered today: . 'What âamazingâ parent acts with complete indifference to the accidental . death of their child?' she asked. 'If this really was an accident in . the pool, Caylee Anthony would have been found floating in a pool, not . floating in a swamp down the street. People whose children have . accidents do somethingâ¦They call 911, they anguish over the death of a . child.' Instead, Anthony, 25, spent 31 days . spinning yarns about her daughter being in the care of a nanny who . turned out to be fictitious, went shopping, went to parties, went . nightclubbing, and got herself a tattoo reading 'Bella vita' â Italian . for 'beautiful life' â until the childâs grandmother Cindy called . police. 'At the end of this case, all you . have to really do is ask yourselves one simple question: Whose life was . better without Caylee?' Ms Drane-Burdick told the jury. 'Was Cindyâs life better?' she asked, . playing a recording of the distraught grandmother weeping down the . telephone to an emergency despatcher in July 2008 that Caylee was . missing. Decision: Judge Belvin Perry told the jury that their decision must be unanimous as they were sent out on Monday . 'Was George Anthonyâs life better,' she demanded, reminding them how Cayleeâs grief-stricken grandfather . attempted suicide after the little girlâs remains were found because he . wanted to be with her. 'Whose life was better?' asked Ms . Drane-Burdick in her final words to the court, pointing to a photograph . of Anthony partying, and an image of her Bella Vita tattoo. 'Thereâs . your answer.' Anthony has pleaded not guilty to . first-degree murder, aggravated child abuse, aggravated manslaughter and . lying to law enforcement. The first-degree murder charge carries the . potential of the death penalty. All 12 jurors must agree for a guilty . verdict to be delivered, though a subsequent death sentence would only . require the agreement of seven. Tears: Casey Anthony yesterday broke down during closing arguments in her murder trial . Final: Casey Anthony is seen before the start of court yesterday as both sides gave their final arguments . The jury was selected from . Clearwater, Florida, 100 miles from Orlando, because of the enormous . media spotlight that has been on the case ever since Cayleeâs . disappearance in June 2008, before Anthony was even arrested. Defence . lawyers had argued that Anthony risked receiving an unfair trial, . resulting in the judge and lawyers on both sides travelling to . Clearwater to swear in jurors who they agreed were not tainted by the . pre-trial publicity. The panel has been sequestered since . selection, meaning that they have not been allowed home for more than . six weeks and have been protected from coverage, including being denied . access to live television and allowed to read newspapers only with holes . cut in them where coverage of the trial was published. Victim: Mystery surrounds the cause of Caylee Anthony's death . Addressing jurors before dispatching . them to their deliberations, Judge Perry gave a timely reminder of the . significance of the July 4 date â the 255th anniversary of Americaâs . Declaration of Independence â and the legal responsibility now resting . on their shoulders. 'Even if you donât like the laws that must be applied, you must use them,' he said. 'For two centuries, we have agreed to a constitution and to live by the law.'","Jurors start deliberating on whether Anthony should face death penalty .

A Tesco checkout manager who cashed Â£100,000 worth of shares meant for his executive namesake has been jailed for two years. Jeffrey Adams was accidentally sent certificates which should have gone to a top U.S. businessman who shared his name. Instead of being sent to the Chief Operating Officer of Tesco's Fresh and Easy business in America the 44,000 shares ended up in the hands of a shopfloor worker from Burton-on-Trent, Staffordshire. St Albans Crown Court heard that the blunder in 2002 was not discovered for seven years. Adams received 13,326 shares in May 2002 and a further 31,094 two months later. He sold Â£57,000 of shares in April 2004 before pocketing a further Â£42,000 in June 2005. When he was arrested in November 2009, the defendant claimed he had been given the shares in the will of his late grandfather Albert Booth. Prosecutor Isabel Delamere told the judge: 'Jeff Adams was employed by Tesco as . the Chief Operating Officers for the Fresh and Easy business in the US. 'He has a high-level executive career and as a senior manager . participates in the Tesco Executive Share Scheme for senior managers. 'The defendant was employed in Burton on Trent as a check out manager and controller.' Adams, who worked at a 24-hour store in St Peter's Bridge, Burton, used the money to buy a home with his second wife who is believed to work at the store. Shop floor worker: Jeffrey Adams was a checkout manager at the St Peter's Bridge 24-hour store in Burton-on-Trent, Staffordshire. He kept Â£100,000 worth of shares which were not meant for him . The store only realised what had happened when the executive tried to sell the shares to purchase a property in California and discovered that they were not in his account with the firm Equiniti. He was arrested by Hertfordshire Police because the supermarket's headquarters is in the county in Cheshunt. The defendant was convicted of two counts of obtaining a money transfer by deception. Defence barrister Anthony Rimmer said Jeffrey Adams was now on Job Seeker's Allowance and was being pursued through the courts by Tesco. Mr Rimmer said the defendant had put his home was on the market and when sold he suspected it would be in negative equity. 'He is financially ruined,' he said. He went on: 'The shares were credited as a result of error and he sat on them for some months. He gave way to temptation and convinced himself they were legitimately acquired.' Mr Rimmer said Jeffrey Adams had not lived a lavish lifestyle and had two children from his first marriage and three step children. Jailing him Judge Stephen Gullick said: 'You have to serve a prison sentence for Â£100,000 of dishonesty. You have shown no remorse and gave no plea of guilty. 'It was not a professional fraud.

The 62-year-old also faces another investigation in France over attempted rape, based on accusations by novelist Tristane Banon. When they landed in France, a police escort was waiting to rush the couple through customs and into a waiting Peugot limousine. French . detectives also indicated that they also intended to speak to Mr . Strauss-Kahn aboutÂ  sex-related accusations being levelled at him in . Paris.

The couple are dwarfed by the massive entrance into their home. Strauss-Kahn admitted having a sexual encounter with the woman, but his lawyers controversially argued that it has been a consensual one . Diallo is continuing to press her claims in a civil lawsuit. Strauss-Kahn denies the allegations. Strauss-Kahn has been free to travel . internationally since his passport was returned late last week . He'd . told reporters he was eager to return to France, but he first took a . trip to Washington, DC, on Monday to bid farewell to former IMF . colleagues at the lending agency's headquarters. Until his arrest, Strauss-Kahn was . considered the Socialist Party's front-runner to take on conservative . French President Nicolas Sarkozy next year. Socialists have rejoiced in . the dismissal of the criminal case against Strauss-Kahn, but few . observers in France expect a political return from him anytime soon. 'This . is a man who has suffered. It is a man who will obviously take some . time to get his bearings,' his biographer, Michel Taubmann said. The maid is continuing to press her claims in a civil lawsuit but it's unclear if Strauss-Kahn will return to New York as defendants aren't required to go court dates . Face the music: Strauss-Kahn was met by a police escort at the airport and left in a waiting Peugot limousine which was chased by a media pack on motorcycles . Strauss-Kahn also will have to . contend with a sexual assault allegation that surfaced in France after . his New York arrest. Authorities are investigating novelist Tristane . Banon's complaint that Strauss-Kahn tried to rape her while she was . interviewing him in 2002 â an incident her mother, a regional Socialist . official, has said she discouraged her from reporting at the time but is . now encouraging her to pursue. Strauss-Kahn's lawyers have called Banon's account 'imaginary'. And Strauss-Kahn still faces Diallo's . lawsuit in New York, though it's unclear when he might have to be in . New York for the civil case. Lawsuits can take years to play out, and . defendants aren't required to come to court dates, as they generally are . in criminal cases.

Diallo, . 33, says Strauss-Kahn chased her down in his suite and attacked her . after she arrived to clean it. Prosecutors said DNA evidence shows they . had a sexual encounter; his lawyers say it was consensual. After initially portraying Diallo as a . compelling witness, prosecutors developed doubts about her credibility. She had told them a concocted tale of having been gang-raped in the . past, among other falsehoods about her background, and they said she . gave varying versions of her actions immediately after her encounter . with Strauss-Kahn. 'We simply no longer have confidence . beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant is guilty,' prosecutors . wrote in a court filing last week.

Happy to go? Strauss-Kahn leaves new York more than three months after he was taken off an Air France jet at JFK . Paris-based barrister Thibault de Montbrial said he had filed the complaint in Pontoise, another Paris suburb, saying Strauss-Kahnâs legal team had âput pressureâ on the witness, including offering her money to remain silent. This would amount to perjury, and could result in a prison sentence for those involved in the alleged cover-up of evidence, with Ms Diallo appearing in Paris as a prosecution witness. It would also allow Ms Dialloâs legal team to rehearse their case against Strauss-Kahn in France, so opening him up to further prosecution.

"By . Gerri Peev, Political Correspondent . Last updated at 8:52 AM on 5th July 2011 . A council boss who earned more than the Prime Minister has left her job with a Â£219,000 pay-off after being accused of bullying and claiming excessive expenses. Andrea Hill, chief executive of Suffolk County Council, has quit the local authority after three years of controversy. She repeatedly defied calls from the Government to take a 10 per cent pay cut â even though she earned around Â£75,000 more than David Cameronâs salary of Â£142,500. Suffolk County Council chief executive Andrea Hill had been on paid leave since Easter but has stepped down . The 47-year-old also faced criticism over her âdomineering management styleâ. A spokesman for Suffolk County Council said Mrs Hill had left the council following âlengthyâ talks. The news was immediately welcomed by one of her leading council critics, Kathy Pollard, who said: âThere will be a feeling of immense relief across the county. âIt has been a very unhappy chapter in Suffolkâs history especially for those of us who voted against her appointment in the first place. âShe introduced cuts but her position became more and more tenuous as she refused to take a pay cut herself - she was obviously not willing to share the pain with the rest of us.â âIt is no secret that the public were very angry about her salary and hopefully there will be full transparency when her successor is appointed with clear salary guidelines - which was not the case with Mrs Hill.â Todayâs announcement, which came after a 90-minute meeting of the councilâs dismissals appeals committee, follows increasing pressure on Mrs Hill to quit. In a statement today, a spokesman for Suffolk County Council said: 'Following a lengthy discussion last Friday, and negotiations between representatives of both parties over the weekend, the county council can now confirm that Mrs Hill will be leaving her post with immediate effect.' Today's announcement, which came after a 90-minute meeting of Suffolk County Council's dismissals appeals committee, follows increasing pressure on Mrs Hill to quit . An independent inquiry was launched into both the accusations of bullying and excessive expenses claims. The councilâs dismissal and appeals committee met to discuss its conclusions. The spokesman added: âBullying and . harassment allegations were robustly investigated. Although it remains a . concern that such a perception existed, the committee is satisfied that . there was no evidence to support those claims.â March 31: Suffolk . County Council confirms Graham Dixon, director of resource management, . and Eric Whitfield, monitoring officer, have left the council. David . White, acting head of legal services, takes on the role of monitoring . officer. April 1: Jeremy . Pembroke, leader of the Conservative-run council, stands down after six . years in his post, saying he wants to give a new leader ""time to . settle"" before council elections in 2013. April 4: Mr White is found hanged in Butley Woods, near Woodbridge, Suffolk. Police say they are not treating his death as suspicious. April 16: . An independent inquiry is launched after senior officials, including . interim council leader Jane Storey, receive an anonymous letter calling . for more support for staff in the legal department during a difficult . time.

Mark Bee is formally elected as council leader. He later announces . plans to abandon many controversial policies, including the outsourcing . of council services. June 3: . The council's discipline and appeals committee meets behind closed . doors. The meeting is believed to have discussed the outcome of a report . prepared by independent investigators from law firm Wragge and Co. July 1: The discipline and appeals committee meets once more. July 4: Suffolk County Council confirms Mrs Hill will be leaving her post with immediate effect. Regarding her expenses claims, the . committee admitted âthere were undoubtedly claims which, in the current . climate, might not represent best use of public moneyâ. But it âaccepted that there was no dishonestyâ. Two senior long-serving council officers resigned suddenly earlier this year, which was followed by the apparent suicide of the head of legal services, David White, who had worked for the council for more than 20 years. An anonymous whistle-blower complained to councillors about Mrs Hillâs management style which led to a detailed investigation by a leading London law firm whose report was considered before todayâs crunch meeting. Mrs Hill had come to Suffolk from a similar job as head of Bedford county council. But a little over three years later, under intense fire for her official life style - thousands of pounds of ratepayersâ money spent on âvanityâ portrait photographs, nights in luxury hotels and expensive âteam buildingâ lessons - her reign is over. A legal inquiry into claims by a whistleblower about Mrs Hill - which has cost thousands of pounds - formally ended last Friday when the councilâs dismissals appeals committee met for five hours to consider its conclusions. After weeks of negotiating between lawyers behind closed doors, the authority has agreed that Mrs Hill will leave - in her handbag a settlement agreement totalling Â£218,592. She has been on extended leave since Easter at the Cambridgeshire home she shares with her husband Philip and their three children and will now be able to spend more time with her family. Before she went on leave Mrs Hill circulated an extraordinary 1,800-word defence to council employees claiming her critics were motivated by envy and that she should be seen as a ârole modelâ. Instead, she said, she had been attacked by the media and political opponents, her children had been bullied, her friends pestered and her staff abused. She also alleged that some websites called for people to carry out âextreme acts of violenceâ against her. But thereâs no triumphant legacy for Mrs Hill either - her controversial âNew Strategic Directionâ policy lies in tatters. The new council chairman, Mark Bee, moved swiftly last month with a promise to scrap large parts of its plan to hive-off services such as libraries, recycling and school crossing patrols. But it was Mrs Hillâs six-figure salary which placed her among the highest-rewarded council chiefs in the country that angered many ratepayers. Not only because it was awarded without the proper procedure, according to critics, but because it was topped up a payment of some Â£50,000 a year âdeferred payâ put into Mrs Hillâs pension pot. By contrast the man she took over from, Mike More, had earlier announced he was giving up a Â£36,000 performance-related bonus, seemingly happy with his Â£200,000 a year as chief executive of Westminster City Council. Mrs Hill stridently pointed out that she had turned down pay increases totalling Â£210 a week but would not consider any reduction in her current salary. In an interview with the local paperâs local government reporter - who was blacklisted for exposing some of Mrs Hillâs spending follies - she insisted: âI do understand it is a big salary but I got the job in open competition. âAnybody in the country could have applied for it - in fact many people did and they were chief executives on similar salaries to mine.â And while it didnât impress librarians or lollipop ladies who were facing the sack at the time, Mrs Hill seemed proud that she had set a good example. She said: âActually I have taken a lead on pay restraint because I decided, quite by myself, to give up a pay increase of Â£5,000 and I gave up another increase in 2009 of over Â£6,000 so thatâs Â£11,000 I have forgone. âI have considered that I have already given up two pay increases and I think that was the thing to do at the time and I wonât be taking another pay cut.â What won the imperious Mrs Hill few friends was her adamant assertion that she was worth her huge salary because she was in 'a high-risk job.' It prompted one angry ratepayer to write pointing out some might consider a young Suffolk soldier in the Royal Anglian Regiment fighting in Iraq on a tenth of her salary was the one in a real high-risk occupation. Mrs Hill never replied or acknowledged the letter.","Andrea Hill, on paid leave since Easter given Â£219k compensation by Suffolk County Council ."
"Beko products involved in one death and 15 injuries . By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 12:44 PM on 6th July 2011 . Fire chiefs warned today that lives are at risk after a model of fridge freezer, owned by thousands of homes and businesses, was pinpointed as a serious danger. Investigators from London Fire Brigade said that a fire last week in Bermondsey, south-east London, which was thought to have been caused by a lightning strike, was in fact caused by a faulty Beko appliance. There are believed to have been 20 fires in the capital alone involving the fridge freezers since 2008. These fires have left 15 people injured and one person dead. Blaze: The fire in a block of flats in Bermondsey, south-east London, was caused by a faulty fridge freezer, said fire investigators . Fire chiefs were urging people to check if they own particular models which were made between January 2000 and October 2006. There are believed to be about 500,000 of the affected appliances in homes and businesses across the country. Over the past three years the brigade's fire investigation team has been working to establish the link between a faulty defroster timer switch on the appliances and a number of house fires. Danger: Beko has issued recall notices to customers for certain models of fridge freezer . London Fire Brigade's Assistant Commissioner for Fire Safety Regulation, Steve Turk, said: 'Any fire can be lethal but the . London Fire Brigade is particularly concerned about this because fires . involving any sort of fridge freezer develop rapidly and produce an . enormous amount of toxic smoke. 'Expert fire investigators have had to work for a long time to . confidently establish these faulty fridge freezers as the cause of a . number of serious fires. 'Having established this link, we have worked . closely with Beko to ensure the public is kept safe. 'However, the brigade urges everyone . who has a Beko fridge freezer to check it is not one of those . highlighted by the company as potentially faulty. 'I would also urge . everyone to make sure they have a working smoke alarm in their house.' There has been an ongoing investigation into the faulty defroster timer switch on the appliances. The problem occurs when water gets into the defrost timer switch which can lead to an electrical malfunction, resulting in plastic components and other highly flammable insulation inside the machine catching fire. The brigade formally alerted Beko to the problem in June 2010 and the manufacturer has now begun trying to locate the products so that the fault can be corrected. However, the brigade believes more needs to be done to alert people to the potential danger.

A Beko spokesman said: 'Since becoming aware of the issue, Beko has been working closely with the London Fire Brigade and Trading Standards to identify the issue and the best method of reaching all affected consumers and arranging a modification. 'We have contacted all retailers who sold these products to seek their help in identifying affected customers from their sales records. 'This has allowed us to mail these customers to make them aware of the issue and to urge them to contact our freephone number to arrange the modification. 'We are working with British Gas and a major electronics retailer to contact owners of these products and carry out a free of charge modification to replace the defrost timer. 'We have adopted a phased approach which allows us to make maximum use of their resource. This allows us to quickly identify which products are affected and have the modification carried out. 'As a result of this ongoing activity we have mailed over 100,000 owners and have successfully located and modified 11,000 units.'

"By . Ray Massey . Last updated at 9:54 AM on 6th July 2011 . The decision to slash more than 1,400 jobs at Britainâs last train-maker after the Governmentâs award of a major contract to Germany was met with uproar yesterday. The axing of posts at Bombardier in Derby sparked a renewed âBritish jobs for British workersâ row as ministers conceded more needed to be done to create âa level playing fieldâ with EU rivals. Unions condemned the move as âthe ultimate stupidityâ, âa scandalâ and âa tragedyâ at odds with the Governmentâs pledge to make âmade in Britain and created in Britainâ its watchword. Devastated: Bombardier staff arrive at work this morning where they were told the firm was shedding 1,400 jobs. The decision comes after the Government's decision to award a lucrative carriage contract to Siemens of Germany . Local MP Chris Williamson said the decision was the equivalent of reading the last rites to the British rail industry. Labour business spokesman John Denham called it a âbody blowâ for British manufacturing. But Transport Secretary Philip . Hammond blamed Labour for the decision to award the order, part of the . Â£6billion Thameslink project in London, to Siemens of Germany. He . claimed the way in which the last Government had drawn up the . procurement contracts to comply with EU trade rules had put British . interests at a disadvantage. He noted that âFrench governments . routinely award contracts for trains to French builders and the Germans . award contracts for trains to German buildersâ. Mr Hammond and Business Secretary . Vince Cable have written to the Prime Minister urging a change in the . way contracts are awarded to give UK manufacturers âa level playing . fieldâ. Under EU rules, the British Government cannot discriminate . against bidding companies from other member states. But in their joint letter, Mr Hammond . and Mr Cable say other EU countries âappear to manage their public . procurement processes with a sharper focus on domestic supply chains . than we have hithertoâ. Blame game: Bombardier in Derby say the 1,400 job cuts are directly as a result of the Government's decision, a claim denied by ministers . It says the UK must, in future, play . the same game as our EU rivals, helping our domestic companies as far as . possible while still staying within the rules. The Siemens bid was chosen because it . gave âbest value for money to the taxpayerâ. The Government said it . would create up to 2,000 UK jobs at the Siemens factory in Hebburn, Tyne . and Wear, and two planned maintenance depots. Bob Crow, general secretary of the . RMT transport union, accused the Government of âcolluding with the EU in . a policy of industrial vandalism that would wipe out train building in . the nation that gave railways to the worldâ. Disagreement: RMT Union chief Bob Crow . (left) says the Government will wipe out train building in Britain but . Transport Secretary Philip Hammond (right) says the job cuts are not . fully the result of the decision to hand the contract to Siemans . Just four months ago, David Cameron dragged the whole Cabinet to Derby, centre of British engineering excellence, to extol the virtues of rebalancing the economy away from finance towards high quality manufacturing. Today, the Prime Minister has to confront the hugely embarrassing fact that one of Derbyâs key businesses, train-maker Bombardier Transportation, is preparing for its demise in Britain because Cameronâs Government has awarded the biggest new contract to make rolling stock in years to German rival Siemens. It really beggars belief that Bombardier could have lost out to the Germans for the Â£1.4billion Thameslink contract to build 1,200 carriages for the route between Bedford and Brighton. Yet the behaviour of the Government in this travesty, which will lead to the loss of 1,400 skilled jobs in Derby, has been utterly pusillanimous. Transport Secretary Philip Hammond, portrayed before the 2010 election as a likely future star of a Tory government, suggests lamely that the decision is the fault of the Labour government. Business Secretary Vince Cable, the minister who has placed himself at the heart of the âgrowth agendaâ, has responded by setting up what he terms an âEconomic Response Task Forceâ. Half of all jobs to go: Chairman of Bombardier Colin Walton (pictured) helped announce the proposed redundancies today . Explanation time: Chairman of Bombardier Colin Walton (2nd left) talks to workers outside the assembly plant this afternoon . No one should kid themselves this means the Coalition is going to try to save the jobs or to reverse the âpreferred bidderâ status given to Siemens â indeed, Philip Hammond has said this is not possible. All it means is that a group of quangocrats has been asked to look at ways of âmitigatingâ the economic impact of the disaster. Past experience â from, for example, the closure of MG-Rover under Labour in 2005 â suggests that resources are made available to help those made redundant find jobs, but after the initial furore dies down the assistance vanishes into the mists. The real tragedy of the Thameslink decision is that it would never have happened if Britain had put the national and public interest first, as our Continental counterparts do. As a country we remain honourably committed to free and open capital markets. But this has allowed overseas firms not only to pick off our best companies but also to win open tenders for valuable contracts â and often with the help of their own governments. Our competitors across Europe and the world do not operate on the same basis of free and open trade. Economic patriotism, looking after home-based industry and making sure it is first in line for important national contracts, is the priority in Paris, Berlin and even Washington. Dejected: This lunchtime Bombardier workers who could lose their jobs walk past a train built at their Derby plant . There is no better example of how Britain has lost control of its own economic destiny than the loss of our train manufacturing capacity.Bombardier would have been delighted to receive the Thameslink contract. But because it is a minor subsidiary of a huge Canadian-based outfit which also makes planes, winning a contract in Britain, on the outer fringe of its empire, would be considered relatively unimportant. The tragedy is that we in Britain once led the world in train-making. In the 1990s, GEC-Alstom (part of the late Lord Weinstockâs General Electric Corporation) was one of the most successful train manufacturers on the planet. Operating out of the Midlands, it was a world leader in high-speed locomotives and train systems. But Weinstockâs successor, Lord Simpson, wasnât interested in old-style manufacturing and invested in telecoms instead. The companyâs half-share in GEC-Alstom was sold to its French partner and, as night follows day, train production went with it. This left Bombardier as the sole representative in the UK of British train-making skills. I have no doubt that Bombardier did its best to win the Thameslink contract. But the best for a relatively small, anonymous subsidiary of a Canadian-based company is simply not good enough. Weinstock was often criticised for being too cautious. But when it came to winning UK government contracts for GEC and preserving engineering and manufacturing jobs in Britain, there was no one better. He and those who worked alongside him believed big British engineering and manufacturing contracts should always go to UK companies. As a result, Weinstock developed an extraordinary network of contacts inside government and the civil service to make sure this happened, and he would take his case personally to the Prime Minister of the day. Such hard work and patriotism paid off. He also recruited as his chairman former Tory minister Lord Prior, who became a super salesman for British industry overseas. Job cuts: Commuters crowd onto a Thameslink service in London, whose new carriages will now be made by a German company, leading to the cutting of 1,400 jobs at British manufacturer Bombardier . Weinstock was, quite simply, the greatest of advocates for Britain and its high-tech and engineering capabilities. But when great UK companies are sold overseas, leaders like him are lost. However committed they might claim be to the British market, foreign companies ensure their own domestic interests come first. That is why we should be so disturbed that a series of great companies with the word âBritishâ in their name, including British Oxygen, British Energy, British Steel and Associated British Ports, have ended up in foreign hands. What really matters when a firm is plundered by an overseas buyer or when a contract is awarded to a foreign competitor, is that it is not just the jobs at the central company, like Bombardier, that are lost but those down the supply chain. For every coach built by a train-maker there are hundreds of manufacturers making each component part. If you cut the main contract, tens of thousands of more jobs right down the line are sacrificed as well as the skills to do them. In the case of Bombardier, it is pathetic for the Government to claim that the decision to buy German-made rather than British trains cannot be reversed. Chancellor George Osborne has declared he wants the words âmade and created in Britainâ to drive the economy forward. He and his fellow ministers now have the opportunity. With the right amount of willpower, as the great British industrialists of the past demonstrated, governments and civil servants can be persuaded â and even ordered â to favour home-grown engineering and industry. Failure by the Government to reverse the Thameslink decision will mean this nation will be doomed to import all of our railway rolling stock forever more, and will signal that we are giving up the ghost on being a world-class manufacturer.","One in two staff at the Derby plant set to lose their jobs .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 4:39 PM on 5th July 2011 . David Peters, 30, has been linked to at least 128 different identities which he used to fleece banks, mortgage lenders and government agencies . A master conman thought to be one of Britain's most prolific identity fraudsters is facing jail after admitting an eight-year scam which netted him at least Â£650,000. David Peters, 30, has been linked to at least 128 different identities, which he used to fleece banks, mortgage lenders and government agencies. He stole Â£168,575 in benefits from three London councils, by claiming to be both tenant and landlord at the same address. Peters obtained a Â£250,000 mortgage for a house in Edgware, North-West London, using one of 74 separate driving licences he fraudulently obtained. He got a second mortgage on a flat in Essex worth Â£157,495 and took more than Â£60,000 from Lloyds TSB in a series of bank frauds. Nigerian Peters, who was also named as Oluseyi Jeremiah Adebayo on court documents, was finally caught last year after City of London police launched an investigation following a tip-off by the DVLA and DWP. Inquiries in April 2010 discovered he had successfully applied for 74 UK driving licences under false names at various rural post offices across the country, using a checking system where the cashier certifies the documents as genuine. On other occasions Peters applied for a change of name via deed poll to get his hands on genuine licences. Through photographic evidence from the DWP, DVLA and banks Peters has been linked to 128 different identities. Peters yesterday admitted multiple counts of making a false statement with a view to obtaining benefit; possession of criminal property; obtaining property by deception; fraud and possession of false identification documents. Scales of justice on top of the Old Bailey in London where the case was heard. Peters will be sentenced here on Wednesday . Police inquiries have discovered Peters was running the con from as far back as October 2002 until December of last year. He will be sentenced at the Old Bailey on Wednesday morning by Judge Gerald Gordon QC. Following his guilty pleas, Detective Inspector Richard Fisher, from the City of London Police, said: 'This is the biggest case of identity theft we have ever investigated, with banks, mortgage lenders and government agencies all being caught in Peters' web of deception. 'The sheer number of the fake identities we discovered are evidence of how Peters was a full-time fraudster who was committed to funding a life of excess for himself at the expense of others.

'By working closely with the DWP we have brought an end to Peters days of deceit, while at the same time sending out a warning to anyone else who likes to act as someone they are not as means to commit a crime.' Peters fraudulently claimed council tax and housing benefit from Barking and Dagenham council, Brent and Enfield local authorities, he also helped himself to jobseeker's allowance and tax credits from Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs. He used the driving licences to obtain a mortgage with the Kensington Mortgage Company, worth Â£256,500 for a property in Edgware, and got a similar deal from Birmingham Midshires for a flat there and one in Dagenham. Peters, of Edgware, North-West London, admitted a total of 29 charges. They were six counts of making a false statement with a view to obtaining benefit; 12 counts of possession of criminal property; three counts of obtaining property by deception; six of fraud and four counts of possession of false identification documents. The charges variously date between October 18, 2002 and December 1, 2010. He was remanded in custody to be sentenced on Wednesday.","Nigerian who had 74 driving licences caught after tip-off .

"By . John Mcdonnell . Last updated at 3:57 PM on 5th July 2011 . Amanda Knox's best friend is so convinced of the innocence of the convicted murderer that she has moved to Italy to be by her side. Madison Paxton has spoken candidly about her regular visits to her 'confidante' in jail and revealed that they sometimes can do nothing but 'hug and cry'. Knox is serving 26 years in jail for the brutal knife murder of British student Meredith Kercher, 21, who was found semi naked and with her throat cut. Close: Madison Paxton, left, is now working as a newspaper photographer in Italy after moving from Seattle to be near to her best friend Amanda Knox (right), who is serving 26 years for murder . Victim: English student Meredith Kercher was found murdered in November 2007 . After her conviction in December 2009, . Knox wrote to Paxton to tell her of her plans if her appeal was . successful - 'ride my bike through Seattle, get married, have children'. But if her appeal was unsuccessful, Knox said she planned to 'get a few degrees, work as a translator', Paxton revealed. Last November, Paxton, 24, moved 5,000 . miles from Seattle to Italy to be close to her friend, and she now has a . job as a photographer on a local newspaper. In an interview with Grazia, Paxton revealed that Knox is keeping busy in jail by studying foreign languages, singing in a choir and learning to play the guitar - but she often breaks down. 'On Amanda's down days there's little I can do. We just hug, cry and thank each other for existing.' She also told how despite Knox, nicknamed 'Foxy Knoxy', receiving 'bundles' of letters of support and marriage proposals from strangers, there is a 'stigma' attached to being friends with the convicted murderer. 'Strangers have spat in our friends' faces and I've received abusive Facebook messages,' Paxton said. Real life: Amanda Knox is led into court in December as she continues to fight for an appeal to prove her innocence in the murder of British student Meredith Kercher . Fictional portrayal: Hayden Panettiere stars as Amanda Knox in the controversial TV movie that has upset everyone involved in the case . Graphic: 'Meredith' lies helplessly on the floor as she is attacked in the TV film portrayal . Lawyers for Amanda Knox are battling to block a TV film about the murder of Meredith Kercher being shown it Italy before the American exchange student's appeal later this year. Amanda Knox: Murder On Trial In Italy was broadcast in the U.S. in February, despite legal objections, but now there is a fight on to stop distribution of the film, which sees Heroes actress Hayden Panettiere portraying Knox and playing an active part in the terrible events. In the disturbing footage, Meredith is seen being held down on the floor by Knox's former boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito, who was convicted of murder with her and Rudy Guede, who was found guilty at an earlier trial. Knox's lawyers claim the film amounts to 'character assassination' of their client and Sollecito, and have even asked for the trailer to be removed from YouTube. The trailer opens with a scene of Knox at home in Seattle surrounded by her father Curt and mother Edda Mellas as they give her a champagne send off as she begins a year abroad in the Italian town of Perugia. It then cuts to her meeting Sollecito at a concert and shows the start of their relationship before switching to a police chief who tells a press conference: 'This was a sex game... Amanda orchestrated the attack.' He then adds: 'Under the angel face, she is capable of anything.' The film, which has been slammed as 'horrific' by Meredith's parents, was shot in Rome during October and November after officials in Perugia denied filmmakers access. Paxton also revealed how the guards in the prison where Knox is being held seem 'sympathetic' towards her plight. 'They sometimes give us chocolate as we chat,' Paxton said. Knox was found guilty after a . year-long trial, but in recent weeks there has been growing unease over . the strength of the evidence used to convict her and fellow accused . Raffaele Sollecito, 27. Last . week a DNA report drawn up by two independent experts said that DNA . found on a 30cm kitchen knife recovered form Sollecito's flat 'could not . be attributed with certainty to Meredith Kercher.' The . report went on to say there was a serious possibility that evidence had . been contaminated and that proper internationally recognised procedures . when collating and examining evidence had not been followed. Knox was given the news by fellow inmates at Capanne jail, near Perugia, after they saw the revelations on television. Clapping and cheering, inmates crowded round her - with many also embracing her and telling her it was only a matter of time before she was released. Knox's appeal will resume at the end of July. The damning report does mean chances of her being freed on appeal have risen significantly, although its claims must still be discussed in court and any decision is unlikely until the autumn. 'I hope more than anything that come September we can be roommates... But first we must prove she didn't kill her last one,' Paxton said. Meanwhile, lawyers for Knox have launched a legal bid to block a TV film about the murder of Meredith Kercher being shown outside the U.S. to prevent it scuppering the pending appeal. Partners in crime: Rudy Guede, left, and Knox's . boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito were convicted of the killing of . Kercher along with the American . It has been claimed by lawyers that the film, which stars Hayden Panettiere as Knox, amounts to 'character assassination' of Knox and Sollecito, who is also appealing his murder conviction. A third defendant, small-time drug dealer Rudy Guede, an immigrant from the Ivory Coast, was also jailed in connection with the brutal killing. He was handed a 30-year sentence - later cut to 16 years - for murder and sexual violence following a fast-track trial in October 2008.","Madison Paxton now working as newspaper photographer in Italy .

"By . Allan Hall . Last updated at 11:44 AM on 7th July 2011 . Germany is asking its citizens to boycott holidays in Demark after the neighbouring country reinstated border controls after decades of passport-free travel. Europe Minister and deputy premier in the state of Hesse, JÃ¶rg-Uwe Hahn, said 'people should vote with their feet' to show their disapproval of the Danish government's policy. Critics say the move breaches the Schengen Agreement - the EU pact which allowed for free movement of citizens between all 25 countries signed up to it. Tightening up: A Danish custom official searches a vehicle on the border with Sweden after the government reinstated border controls . Clampdown: The Danish government has said it is reintroducing border controls to tackle drug and weapon smuggling . Denmark has reinstated border controls with Germany and Sweden. Mr Hahn said: 'I can only advise people to do a U-turn and take a holiday in Austria or Poland. 'This would be a vote with the feet by which you would be able to show the Danish government what you think of their policy.' The Danish government has said it is bringing back border checks, complete with customs searches, in a bid to clamp down on smuggled drugs and weapons. It insists that it is legal within the Schengen framework and blasted the reaction in Germany as 'hysteria'. Peter Christensen, minister for customs and taxation, said: 'The vast majority of travellers won't notice the checks. We welcome German holidaymakers.' Anger: Trucks drive past the Germany-Denmark border in Frosley. Officials in Germany have called for a boycott of the Scandinavian country . Freedom of movement: Critics have said the move goes against the Schengen Agreement - which created a passport-less travel zone for EU citizens . Denmark said it had been awash with smuggled guns, black money and drugs in recent years and that the measures at the border were aimed at stopping these illegal activities. The country's TV2 showed live footage of customs officers searching cars as they pass through border controls. Alexander Alvaro, a German MEP, called the controls 'a backward roll' which 'endangers the cohesion of the EU as a whole'. Measures: Danish customs director Erling Andersen said travellers from within the EU would not be required to show their passports . Customs controls will gradually be strengthened to include new buildings at crossings, lower speed limits at checkpoints and new equipment for reading licence plates of passing vehicles. By the end of 2011, a total of 98 additional customs officers will join the country's 182-man force at the borders between Germany and Sweden. Officers will not be checking passports, which is believed to make it compatible with Schengen rules. Tax and customs administration director Erling Andersen said: 'The main difference is people will see more customs uniforms, more random controls than they are used to.' The Schengen Agreement was initially signed in 1985 in five of the ten member states of the European Economic Community and created the border-less Schengen Area. It now allows passport-less travel throughout the EU, so long as the traveller has a national identity card. Passports are still required where there is no identity card. But in May, 15 of EU signatories said they would be in favour of reinstating border controls at a meeting in Brussels. France and Italy have been pushing for a revision of the Schengen agreement since conflicts in North Africa, including Libya and Tunisia, saw tens of thousands of immigrants arriving into the country from the unrest. EU Home Affairs Commissioner Cecilia Malmstroem said that 'it may also be necessary to foresee the temporary reintroduction of limited internal border controls under very exceptional circumstances'.",Danish government says it is bringing back checks to clamp down on drugs and weapons smuggling .

A top lieutenant of one of Mexico's most feared drugs cartels, who was wanted in connection with the shooting of two U.S. customs officers, has been paraded in front of the media after being captured without a shot being fired. The United States government had offered a $5 million dollar reward for the capture of Jesus 'El Mamito' Rejon, who is said to have been partly responsible for the shooting of two U.S. Customs agents earlier this year. Agent Jaime Zapata was killed and his colleague Victor Avila wounded in the leg, when the armoured car they were travelling in was ambushed by suspected gang members. Facing justice: Jesus 'El Mamito' Rejon is paraded in front of the press along with a hoard of weapons, ammunition and cash . Mexican security sources say El Mamito, which translates as 'Pretty Boy', was travelling with a Mexico City police officer who was brokering the his passage through the region. Both he and the police officer were arrested without a shot being fired. Proud: Mr Zapata, was fiercely dedicated to his job despite the risks. He also loved to fish, travel to Mexico and barbecue with friends . Rejon is a founding member and . currently third in command of the feared Zeta Cartel, which was started . by former Mexican special forces soldiers and is considered to be one of . the country's most brutal criminal organisations. A . week after the Agent Zapata was killed, Mexican police arrested an . alleged Zeta cartel hit man who is believed to have organised the . ambush. He told authorities . that they had attacked the U.S. agents by mistake because the Zetas . thought their car belonged to a rival gang. Turf . wars between the Zetas and other cartels have transformed parts of . Mexico into lawless killing grounds and scared away some foreign . investors. Around 40,000 . people have died in Mexico's drug wars since President Felipe Calderon . took office in December 2006. Calderon has deployed the military to the . streets to attack the powerful cartels. Rejon, . whose true age is not known, served in an elite unit of the Mexican . army, which included a stint at the attorney general's office, before . deserting in 1999. That . year he joined up with 13 others, most of them former soldiers, to . create the Zetas, initially the paramilitary protection force for the . powerful Gulf cartel. Rejon, a former Mexican special forces soldier, is believed to to be third in command of the feared Zetas drug cartel . The .

At the weekend Dominique Strauss-Kahn was celebrating his release from house arrest with truffles and fine wine in an expensive New York restaurant. The rape case brought against him by a hotel chambermaid was on the brink of collapse. But if the former head of the International Monetary Fund thought he was in the clear and could now take a run at the French presidency, yesterday brought a new setback. Drawn: Tristane Banon in 2004 and, right, yesterday in Paris, tired and gaunt . New battle: Strauss-Kahn with his wife Anne Sinclair . French journalist Tristane Banon accused 62-year-old Strauss-Kahn of attempting to rape her in 2003. Miss Banon says she was âsickenedâ to . see photographs of the economist and his wife Anne Sinclair toasting . the apparent collapse of the New York case. She says she was attacked by . Strauss-Kahn in a Paris studio flat, with him acting like aÂ  ârutting . chimpanzeeâ as he tried to pull her clothes off. Miss Banonâs lawyer David Koubbi . confirmed that her complaint â which will be received by prosecutors on . Wednesday â was âextremely solid and well documentedâ. He added: âWe . wonât let go.â Attempted rape carries a sentence of . up to 15 years in France â more if there are aggravating circumstances . such as the use of violence. In an interview with LâExpress magazine, Miss Banon recounted the alleged attack when she went to interview Strauss-Kahn. âWhen I entered that flat, I immediately felt ill at ease,â she said, adding that the flat was almost empty.

"He wore socks over his shoes, left iPhone as decoy and stabbed himself in stomach as part of 'elaborate charade' Efforts to remain undetected failed when neighbours heard victim screaming . By . Claire Ellicott . Last updated at 10:49 PM on 17th June 2011 . A fan of the American crime series CSI who used criminal techniques learned from the programme to murder his estranged wife has been jailed for 25 years. Damian Fincher stabbed Gabrielle Chapman 20 times in a âferociousâ attack at their former marital home after lying in wait for her. Among the ideas he picked up from the TV series were wearing socks on the outside of his trainers to make any footprints less visible and leaving his iPhone at his motherâs house to avoid the signal being picked up and his movements established. Killed: Damian Fincher stabbed Gabrielle Chapman 20 times . In an âelaborate charadeâ, he also left his car miles from the murder scene in Rugby, Warwickshire, and proceeded on foot and tried to make the attack look like a burglary gone wrong. Simon Edwards, prosecuting, said Fincher had tried to âput some of the knowledge that he gleaned from his interest in CSI police procedure to commit a crime that he clearly expected to walk away from undetectedâ. But his evil plot was foiled when neighbours and passers-by heard the 42-year-old midwife screaming as her husband stabbed her. In a desperate attempt to fool police, Fincher, 45, then stabbed himself in the stomach. Birmingham Crown Court was told he had waited for his wife with a knife he had previously hidden in a drawer before stabbing her 20 times in the chest, puncturing her aorta and a lung. Murder scene: The house in Rugby, Warwickshire, where . Damian Fincher killed his estranged wife Gabrielle Chapman . After his arrest, he claimed that he had taken cocaine, diazepam and drunk half a bottle of wine and blacked out before the incident. But the jury found him guilty of murder and friends and family of Miss Chapman cheered as Fincher was told he would have to serve a minimum of 25 years in jail before he could be considered for parole. He showed no remorse in court and interrupted the sentencingÂ  to make an abusive remark about his wife. As he was led away, he turned to face Miss Chapmanâs sobbing family and shouted further abuse. It was not the first time Fincher had been in court over a killing. He was convicted in 1993 at Birmingham Crown Court of manslaughter for acting as a driver to a gunman who shot another man dead. He had been sentenced to six yearsâ imprisonment. Fincher and Miss Chapman had met in 2005 and married, but their relationship ran into trouble because of his jealousy. He repeatedly checked his wifeâs mobile phone and laptop to see who she was in touch with, the court heard. They eventually split when she was unable to conceive and an IVF attempt failed. She then, she started seeing another man. Elaborate: Damian Fincher, 45, stabbed his estranged wife Gabrielle Chapman 20 times and then used forensic techniques he had seen on the popular cop show CSI to avoid detection . Sentencing, Mrs Justice Nicola Davies said: âOn July 31, 2010, your estranged wife returned to the place where she believed she would be safe. Unbeknown to her, youÂ  had let yourself in and were waiting for her. âYou attempted to recreate the scene of a burglary, but your plan began to go wrong when, as a result of your ferocious attack on Gabi, she began to scream. âWhen the police arrived, you continued your elaborate charade, which even included stabbing yourself in the stomach at one point.â She added: âBecause you were unable or unwilling to allow Gabi to get on with her life, you deprived her parents of a much-loved daughter, her brother of a much-loved sister, and her friends of a much-loved companion.â Outside court, Miss Chapmanâs father, Roy Billingsley, said: âWeâre thrilled that this monster is off the streets for 25 years. âNo sentence could ever help heal the pain of losing Gabi. She was a beautiful woman, and a much-loved daughter, sister and friend. âShe always saw the good inÂ  people, and gave them the benefit of the doubt â and that turned out to be her downfall.â He added that the family had decided to move away from the area because it was too painful to be reminded of her absence.","He wore socks over his shoes, left iPhone as decoy and stabbed himself in stomach as part of 'elaborate charade'

When Paula Ross was a toddler she was forced to eat fruit like every other child - but it drove her bananas for more than 20 years. Now aged 23 and after years of enduring a phobia to bananas she has finally conquered a childhood fear that saw her nauseous at the sight of one. Her fear became so bad that she couldn't bear to be in the same room as the fruit and felt sick if she smelled one. I beat my phobia: Paula Ross from Kilmarnock in Ayrshire, has overcome a lifelong fear of bananas . She suffered torment at school as bullies chased her round the playground brandishing bananas. But now after a programme of hypnotherapy she is regularly eating them. Paula said: 'It is a ridiculous fear, but it is something I have had since I can remember. 'People used to chase me round the playground at school with banana peels and everyone used to laugh at me. They thought it was hilarious. 'I couldn't even stand to be in the same room as a banana but this therapy has changed my life. It is absolutely fantastic.' Fighting phobia: Paula Ross is a keen Taekwondo competitor and says therapy helped her fight her fears .

Paula, who will soon start a bioscience course at university with the hope of become a biology teacher, said: 'I couldn't believe it at the end of the session. I was handed a banana and that was that. 'I can go for lunch with my friends and I don't have to worry about being around if they have a banana. I am forever grateful.' Her therapist John Bruce, who works for Epilepsy Connections in Paisley, Renfrewshire, said: 'It is a strange phobia to have. Before I spoke to Paula I had no idea you could have a phobia of a banana. 'I got her to imagine she was holding a banana and imagine the feelings she would normally be experiencing. 'Then I took her mind back to a time when she didn't have the phobia and taught her to associate those calm, happy feelings with bananas. 'I have never done anything like that before so it was fun to go through with her and I am glad she is doing so well.'","Fear started when Paula was forced fed them as a child .

But for parents Wendy Shires and Richard Harpin, they know that a hot day could kill their eight-year-old daughter. Hannah Harpin, of Huddersfield, West Yorkshire, suffers from genetic disorder Ectodermal Dysplasia, which prevents her sweat glands from working. The Lower Hopton Junior and Infant School pupil is one of eight people in the UK and 30 worldwide known to suffer from Hay-Wells syndrome, a type of Ectodermal Dysplasia. Rare condition: Hannah Harpin is one of 30 people worldwide known to suffer from Hay-Wells syndrome (pictured with her mother Wendy and father Richard) If she gets too warm she could overheat and suffer a fatal fit. Her parents ensure she is kept cool by carrying around cold water spray, ice-packs and a fan. Banson Toolhire manager Richard, 40, said: âWe have to be so careful that she doesn't get too warm, we use cold, wet towels on her and we often soak her baseball cap in water. âShe always sleeps with a fan on and will not go outside on warm days and when she is out in the garden she has to be really careful. âIf we didn't do this, we just don't know what would happen, she would fit which could be dreadful.â As a result of the disorder, Hannah barely has any hair, her eyelashes are sparse and her left eye has never properly opened. She has webbed toes, uses a Bone Anchored Hearing Aid (BAHA), a new type of hearing aid that enters its sound output into the cochlea by vibrating the mastoid bone, and also has no tear ducts. Her mother, 37, said: âAs a baby, we would only know that she was upset because she wouldn't settle as she couldn't produce tears. âJust after she was born we found that we had so many doctors to deal with, we didn't know what to think. Hannah suffers from genetic disorder Ectodermal Dysplasia, which prevents her sweat glands from working . âShe was trying to cry and they discovered she had a cleft palate, so they carried out lots of tests and found out that she had this rare condition. âDoctors said it is genetic, so it could have been in the family for as far back as 100 years. âWe don't know of anyone that has it but it could be there. It is a lot more common in women. âHer school is much better at dealing with her condition now and they know how to look after her. âWe are so proud of her and are so amazed in the way that she copes. âHannah is starting to know herself, how to deal with her condition and she regularly asks for her water bottle. âShe has started to ask a lot of questions about her condition and because of her hair sometimes she will ask, 'mummy I don't have cancer do I?' and then we discuss Hay-Wells syndrome. âOur other daughter Amelia, who is only four, sometimes asks if she is special like Hannah and I explain that they are both very special in different kind of ways.â The couple, who are due to marry on Hannah's ninth birthday in two weeks, have had lots of support from the Ectodermal Dysplasia society. Wendy said: âThey have been so helpful and Diana Perry who runs the society is more of a friend, she offers such fantastic support. âI was in touch with other families suffering with the disorder, but we have so much to worry about that often it is better that we just concentrate on Hannah.â They aim to raise awareness of Jeans for Genes, a support group that helps people cope with rare genetic disorders. Hannah is going to attend Jeans for Genes Day in Cheltenham on October 7 to meet another two girls who suffer from the condition.",Hannah Harpin is one of only 30 people worldwide known to suffer from Hay-Wells syndrome .

Since then the one-year-old has been nursed back to health at the zoo, where he was fed on fish milkshakes. He won the hearts of 250,000 fans who watched his progress on a web camera. More than 1,700 of those gathered to bid him farewell on Sunday. Happy Feet has even been fitted with a GPS tracker, so his admirers will be able to follow him once he is released into the wild. Lisa Argilla, a vet, said he has a âstronger and stroppier attitudeâ than when he was found. âHeâs definitely a survivor,â she said. The one-year-old has put on 18lb at Wellington Zoo in the last two months after 7lb of sand, sticks and stones were removed from his stomach. He was fed on a diet of fish milkshakes in an air-conditioned room. Yesterday he was moved to the research vessel Tangaroa ready to be taken to the Southern Ocean. Comedian Stephen Fry was among the people to visit Happy Feet while he was being nursed back to health. Vets placed him in a custom-made crate for the journey. He will be kept cool with 60 buckets of ice and fed fish as he makes his way home. His story has touched people from around the world. A web camera set up at the zoo has attracted about a quarter of a million viewers - despite the penguin doing little more than eating, sleeping and waddling. Long trip home: The penguin is carried to research ship Tangaroa before making his four-day journey back to the Southern Ocean. He will be fed fish and kept cool with ice . Online tracking: Happy Feet stands in his container next to Gareth Morgan who helped to pay for GPS equipment which will enable the public to stay in touch with where the one-year-old penguin goes . 'He's brought a lot of hope and joy . to people,' said Karen Fifield, Wellington Zoo's chief executive. 'His . story has driven to the heart of what makes us human.' He had been eating wet sand on Peka Peka Beach to keep cool. The Tangaroa is New Zealand's largest . research vessel and was already scheduled to head to southern waters to . check on fish numbers in order to set quotas. He will be released after four days at sea at a latitude of 51 degrees south. The boat's skipper Richard O'Driscoll . said that once the Tangaroa has reached the drop-off point, he will . likely cut the engines and then release the penguin from the deck into . the sea with a makeshift canvas slide. More . than 1,700 people gathered at the zoo yesterday to say a final goodbye . to Happy Feet, who was visible in a glassed area while getting final . medical checks. Dr Argilla said that by next year Happy Feet he will be old enough to find a mate and breed. She . added: 'He'll hopefully bump into some penguins that he recognises.

"By . Mark Duell . Last updated at 11:18 PM on 5th September 2011 . In one of the most partisan speeches of his presidency, an under-fire Barack Obama today went back to his core supporters to try to revive his flagging fortunes. President Obama was expected to preview his ideas for job creation and economic growth in Detroit, Michigan, after world stock markets slumped. But it turned into far more of a Democratic political rally, leaving him open to accusations of being short on important details and high on rhetoric. Scroll down for video . Warm-up: Barack Obama was previewing his ideas for job creation and economic growth at a rally in Detroit after world stock markets slumped . Mr Obama, 50, even alluded to his first campaign slogan of 'yes we can', ahead of his vital jobs speech to Congress on Thursday. The President's appearance follows . last Friday's dismal jobs report, which showed employers added no jobs . last month for the first time since 1945. President Obama mentioned a speech made by Harry Truman in Detroit on Labor Day in 1948. Mr Truman, right, had said the government managed to turn 'the greatest depression in history into the most prosperous era the country has ever seen'. He talked of a 'danger...for those who do not belong to unions' and said there was 'much to hope for' from a Congress 'friendly to labour'. Mr Obama said 'things haven't changed' and that the gains of labour will help U.S. prosperity. Global stock markets also took a hit on . Monday after the awful data that revived fears the world's largest . economy is heading back into recession. Supporters chanted 'four more years' before Mr Obama began speaking. 'This day belongs to you,' he told . the labour union crowd. 'You've been working hard to make ends meet and . build a better life for your kids.' 'We've gone through a difficult decade - where wealth was valued over work and greed was valued over responsibility,' he said. 'We've got a lot more work to do to recover fully from this recession. We've got to fully restore the middle class of America. 'There is work to be done and the workers to do it. We just need to get Congress on board. Let's get America back to work.' Under-fire: Mr Obama's speech turned into far more of a political rally, leaving him open to accusations of being short on details and high on rhetoric . He pushed for Republicans and Democrats . to 'work together'. 'The time for Washington games is over,' he said. 'The time for action is now. 'We've got a lot more work to do to recover fully from this recession. We've got to fully restore the middle class of America' President Barack Obama . 'We're fighting to give our kids a better life than we had' and for a system where 'everyone's got a shot at the American dream'. Mr Obama insisted he will stand up for collective bargaining - and that every American has the right to have a voice in labour negotations. 'We are one nation - we are one people,' he said. 'I'm not scared of tough times because I know we're all going to be marching together.' With a steady 9.1 per cent unemployment . rate, he needs to help millions of jobless people back into work - and . improve his re-election chances. Gloomy outlook: Across the world markets slumped following the worst U.S. employment report in almost one year . Public polls show the economy and jobs . are top concerns, with approval of Mr Obama's economic stewardship at a . new low of 26 per cent. Mr . Obamaâs GOP critics who are hoping to take him on for the 2012 . presidency have also been given fresh ammunition to use against him. '(Mr Obama) is very mindful of what the . needs and concerns are of those individuals who have been out of work . for so long' Labor Secretary Hilda Solis . Mitt Romney, set to unveil his own jobs . plan on Tuesday, called the report unacceptable and âfurther proof that . President Obama has failedâ. Mr Obama's plan is expected to include a combination of individual and business tax credits and public works spending. Labor Secretary Hilda Solis said on Monday that both political parties should get behind Mr Obama's efforts to improve hiring. Mr Obama âis very mindful of what the needs and concerns are of those individuals who have been out of work for so longâ, she told NBC. âWe need to focus like a laser beam on this right away,â she told ABC. Concerns: German traders monitor the DAX index board after a five per cent fall . Mr Obama spent part of the holiday weekend at Maryland's Camp David presidential retreat, âputting the finishing touchesâ on proposals. Meanwhile, oil prices extended losses to below $86 a barrel as the jobs data suggested a weak U.S. economy will lessen demand for crude. European stocks tumbled four per cent on Monday, with banks plumbing a more-than two year low, as fears for the future of the euro zone intensified. Britain's FTSE 100 dropped 3.6 per cent, Germany's DAX fell 5.3 per cent and France's CAC-40 toppled 4.7 per cent on a bad day for the markets. It was the FTSE's second-biggest fall of the year, although its losses were smaller than Paris and Frankfurt's. U.S. markets are closed for Labor Day. Japan's Nikkei 225 stock average sank 1.9 per cent to close at 8,784.46 as the Yen shows persistent strength, which hurts exporters. Bad day at the office: A Korean currency trader covers his face with his hands . Investors were staying out as . expectations mounted the Federal Reserve would take action at its . September meeting to support the U.S. economy. Analysts said that a third round of bond purchases, dubbed quantitative easing III or QE3, could take place. âRight now the possibility has increased,â said Linus Yip, a strategist at First Shanghai Securities in Hong Kong. âI think they have to do something. The markets are expecting QE3.â The Dow Jones industrial average closed 2.2 per cent lower on Friday, wiping out its gain for the week, after the August jobs report. It lost 253.31 points to close at 11,240.26 in its biggest fall for two weeks. The Standard & Poor's 500 index fell 2.5 per cent to 1,173.97 while the Nasdaq composite fell 2.6 per cent to 2,480.33. 'Obama will face a decidedly colder . and more sceptical audience on Thursday, when he presents his jobs plan . on the House floor - in front of the lawmakers he is increasingly . decrying as obstructionist and out of touch.'(Zeke Miller, Business Insider) 'The rally at times felt like a campaign event, with enthusiastic supporters wearing Obama buttons and hats'(David Nakamura, Washington Post) 'The tone of the Labor Day speech indicates advisers inside the White House pushing for a jobs agenda to trump talk of debt and deficits have momentum going into Thursday's speech'(Ryan Grim, Huffington Post) 'Anyone who thinks Obama has lost his mojo should watch (the) Detroit speech. He had a godawful summer but only a naÃ¯f would underestimate this guy'(Jonathan Alter, Bloomberg) 'It was feisty and framed in part as a challenge to Republicans to join his jobs push and, as the President put it, to prove they care as much about the middle class as they say they do.'(Naftali Bendavid, Wall Street Journal) See video here .","Obama speaks at union rally in Detroit on Labor Day .

"By . Chris Brooke . Last updated at 1:08 PM on 6th September 2011 . A music teacher murdered his fiancÃ©e and hid her body in a suitcase to convince a second lover that he was a single parent living alone, a court heard. Andrew Lindo, 29, throttled Marie Stewart as she lay in bed, smashed her on the head with his daughterâs Winnie-the-Pooh chair and finally stabbed her while their two children slept. He hid 30-year-old Miss Stewartâs body in a suitcase in the garage then calmly picked upâ the other woman he called his âfuture wifeâ â and took her home to spend the night with him. Accused: Andrew Lindo (left) denies murdering his partner Marie Stewart . A week later, on Christmas Day, Miss Stewartâs father and other relativesÂ  visited Lindo. He convinced them she was suffering from post-natal depression and had left him and the children to be with another man, Bradford Crown Court heard. But almost two months later Miss Stewartâs family called in the police. They searched Lindoâs home in Holmfirth, West Yorkshire, and found her decomposing body. Lindo admitted killing her, claiming he âlost his self-controlâ because he believed she was abusing their three-year-old daughter. He denies murder but admits manslaughter. 'Mutual attraction': Lindo was seeing Angela Rylance at the time he is alleged to have killed his fiancee . Lindo was an âinveterate and accomplished liarâ who lived a double life with a âseries of hapless womenâ, Michelle Colborne QC, prosecuting, told the court. He had simultaneous relationships with two other women he met at work, Amy Wilde and Alison Doram, when Miss Stewart was pregnant with their second child. Six months later he met Angela Rylance, who worked at the Money Shop in Barnsley where Lindo cashed his pay cheques. There was a âmutual attractionâ and . Lindo convinced her that MissÂ  Stewart had walked out on the family . within two weeks of giving birth, and that he was single. For the next four months he played . out an elaborate charade, pretending toÂ  Miss Stewart, a classroom . assistant, that he was faithful to her, and telling Miss Rylance that . she was the only womanÂ  in his life. Miss Rylance spent time in his house . and with his children on many occasions, the court heard. Miss Stewart . became suspicious when her daughter mentioned âAngelaâ, but he said it . was due to the childâs fertile imagination. Abandoned: Marie Stewart's body was left in this garage for two months . Eight days before the killing Miss Stewart phoned a friend, crying hysterically, and said she had proof Lindo was cheating on her. The friend phoned Miss Rylance, who confirmed the relationship and promised not to see Lindo again. Lindo again brazenly lied to Miss Rylance and assured her he loved her and that he had taken legal advice over Miss Stewartâs âharassmentâ of him, the court heard. But Miss Rylance was dubious and told him that until she spent a night at his house her doubts would remain. They made a date for that overnight stay for a week later on Saturday, December 18. In the week leading up to the killing Lindo sent texts to Miss Stewart to try to keep her happy. One said: âIâm sorry baby, I want us to work so much. Iâll try harder.â Another said: âLove you darling.â On the evening of the murder, neighbours heard Lindo and Miss Stewart arguing, and the prosecution said this row ended in murder. Describing the killing to police, Lindo said he started to squeeze Miss Stewartâs neck âwhilst placing his arm over her eyes so that she wasnât looking at himâ. She turned purple and went silent. Then she started making a noise again. He heaved her into a suitcase and managed to drag it down the stairs. Court: Lindo is on trial at Bradford Crown Court . He said the noises from Miss Stewart started again and he thought: âI canât strangle you, Iâm obviously s*** at strangling you, Iâm just going to hit you.â He smashed her over the head with his daughterâs wooden chair, but she came round again. As his helpless victimâs body began to move he spotted some bubble wrap. Describing the killing as âundoubted tortureâ, Miss Colborne said: âThe defendant said that the only thing he could think of doing was to cut her throat, just to stop it. âHe wrapped the bubble wrap round her head because he didnât want to see her face, didnât want her looking at him. He said he grabbed a knife and jabbed it in.â The court was told that after cleaning the murder scene Lindo drove with his children about 20 miles to Barnsley, arriving at Miss Rylanceâs house at 11pm. He told her he was so late because police had breath-tested him, and took his unsuspecting lover home with him. They remade the bed where he had attacked his fiancÃ©e hours earlier and got into it. The following day he spent âan entirely pleasant dayâ with Miss Rylance âat the scene of the previous nightâs brutalityâ, the jury heard. Lindo then began building his cover story and âset in train an elaborate set of lies designed to blacken her nameâ. He told the victimâs sister that she had taken her clothes from the house âand left with a man in a carâ. He told Miss Stewartâs GP she was âhaving fun in the sunâ. Lindo also texted Miss Stewartâs phone with the message: âPlease come home baby I love you so much.â Using her phone he allegedly texted a friend to reassure her: âFeeling a little better for being away for a bit. Iâm safe.â This friend was a police officer, and when Miss Stewart had not turned up by mid- February she spoke to the victimâs family and the police were called in. The case continues.","Andrew Lindo left Marie Stewart's body in a suitcase for two months after killing her, according to prosecutors .

"By . Emily Andrews and James Tozer . Last updated at 7:45 AM on 6th September 2011 . The nurse cleared of poisoning patients vowed to clear her name yesterday as she left home for the first time since her release from prison. Rebecca Leighton, who has changed her dyed red hair to black, spent more than six weeks in custody after a number of elderly patients died from suspected saline drip contamination. She was released on Friday when all charges were dropped due to lack of evidence. Free: Charges against Rebecca Leighton, 27, pictured for the first time today, were dropped on Friday . Her lawyer said the case against her became untenable when police realised that a saline bag bearing her fingerprints had not been tampered with. Solicitor Carl Richmond claimed 27-year-old Miss Leighton had been made a scapegoat by police who felt under pressure to end the âchaosâ surrounding the case and that she was determined to clear her name. Since her release, she has remained at the family home in Denton, Greater Manchester, with her parents Linda and David, and fiancÃ© Tim Papworth, 28. She is still suspended from working as a nurse after she was accused of contaminating saline fluids with insulin at Stepping Hill Hospital, in Stockport, Cheshire. Mr Richmond said she would ask the Nursing and Midwifery Council to overturn the suspension. Rebecca Leighton, pictured, now plans to sue . police for a six-figure sum, claiming wrongful arrest, or trying to gain . compensation worth up to Â£1million . Innocent: Miss Leighton and her boyfriend Tim Papworth today. She was driven off her father's Vauxhall Astra . Linda and David Leighton, parents of nurse Rebecca Leighton, along with their solicitor Carl Richmond outside their home on Friday . He said: âShe wants the opportunity . to have her suspension lifted and then she will make the decision what . to do next. She has worked as a nurse for a long time so thatâs . obviously in her thoughts but sheâs still a bit raw. âShe wants to clear her name professionally and thatâs her priority at the moment.â Asked whether she would return to . work at Stepping Hill, Mr Richmond said: âI donât know. It might be too . difficult. The finger of suspicion was firmly pointed at her and you . donât recover from that quickly. Freed: Miss Leighton is at home with her parents in Denton, Greater Manchester . âShe needs to clear her head and . decide whatâs best for her in the long term. She has gone away with her . family to consider this. âShe feels dreadfully sorry for the families of the victims.â Police are investigating the deaths . of seven patients connected with sabotaged saline drips. Officers . believe another 33 may also have been potential victims of . contamination, but survived. Claiming that Miss Leighton had been . made a scapegoat, her solicitor said: âThere was absolute chaos at the . hospital and it could not function because of all the speculation. âI was imploring the police to bail her while they continued their inquiries but the decision was made to charge.â Instead of pursuing the normal course . of granting Miss Leighton bail while inquiries continued, officers . decided to arrest her on suspicion of murder and then charge her with . causing criminal damage with intent to endanger life at Stepping Hill . Hospital. Miss Leighton could now sue police for a six-figure sum for wrongful arrest or compensation for her prison ordeal.

Republicans are said to be sceptical about frontrunner Mitt Romneyâs candidacy, with many believing the former Massachusetts governor is not equipped with enough skills for the job. Others say Rick Perry might be doing well in the polls but voters do not know what to expect from the Texas Governor - and cannot put their finger on anyone who would be good enough for the job. The White House is not believed to be seriously concerned about any Republican candidates for the 2012 presidency - but Mr Obamaâs team is worried Governor Christie could represent a big threat.

"By . Joanna Corrigan . Last updated at 11:22 AM on 6th September 2011 . Up to 750,000 people could die from famine in East Africa over the next four months, the United Nations has warned. The UN says some 12 million people across the region, and four million in Somalia alone, are in need of food aid. The top humanitarian official for Somalia says getting aid to the starving is a 'race against time' and warned the famine is likely to spread before the end of the year. Mark Bowden, who heads the UN office coordinating humanitarian aid to Somalia, said: 'This isn't a short-term crisis.' A woman and her malnourished child rest inside a ward at Banadir hospital in Somalia's capital Mogadishu . Refugees wait to receive relief food from members of al Shabaab, Al Qaeda-linked insurgents . There are fears as many as 750,000 people could starve to death unless enough aid reaches the stricken region. This is a rise of 66 per cent from July. Hundreds of Somalis are dying every day, at least half of which are children. Mr Bowden said the four million Somalis in need of aid represented more than half of the country's entire population. The southern Bay region is the latest to be declared a famine zone. Nearly 60 per cent of people there are acutely malnourished - four times the rate at which an emergency is declared. Grainne Moloney, the head of the food security unit, said: 'I've not seen anything like it.' A child preparing a cooking fire outside his family's makeshift shelter at Maajo settlement camp in Mogadishu . Somali women carrying relief food from Seyidka, a settlement camp for people who have lost their homes . Famine has now affected six areas, including four southern Somali regions and two settlements of refugees. The U.N. says tens of thousands of people already have died in Somalia due to the severe violence, drought and famine. More than 150,000 refugees have sought aid in the last few months. Families in Kenya, Ethiopia and Djibouti have also been affected. Somalia has been hit hardest, its problems compounded by more than 20 years of civil war and Islamist insurgents that banned many aid agencies, including the UN's World Food Program, from their territory. Women wait to receive items from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees at the Maajo settlement . The Islamists hold much of Somalia's southern agricultural region. Ms Maloney said a bad drought meant that harvests there are a quarter of normal levels - the worst for 17 years. The price of a day's casual labour has dropped from 33 pounds (15kg) of cereal to seven pounds (3kg), she said. Mr Bowden said access to areas in the south held by the al-Shabab insurgent militia was improving and that there were some aid agencies that were able to work there. 'There's a far greater level of coverage than we anticipated,' he said. The UN food agency is concentrating on the areas of Somalia it does have access to - which includes about 1.9million people. It is encouraging donors to fund other agencies who had access to southern areas, spokeswoman Challiss McDonough said.","66% more at risk of starving to death than in July .

"By . Suzanne Breen . Last updated at 11:17 AM on 6th September 2011 . A father is launching a landmark legal battle against Facebook after suggestive photographs of his 12-year-old daughter allegedly appeared on the website. In the ground-breaking writ, he claims that âphotographic images and literary contentâ on the site have put his daughter in danger of being targeted by paedophiles. If his claim is successful, theÂ  company â which is valued at Â£17.5billion â could face a massive compensation payout. Facebook requires users to be over 13 - but relies on children to be truthful about their age. Picture posed by model . Facebook, which has more than 750million users across the world, requires its members to be over 13, but relies on children to be truthful about their age and doesnât ask for verification. Last night the girlâs father, who cannot be named in order to protect his daughterâs identity, revealed his fears that she may be enticed to run away by sex abusers who use the social networking site. He told how one picture of the girl lifting her top had been removed, but said another showing her wearing a low-cut top and make-up is still visible. In the writ, filed last night, he warns he will seek an injunction ordering Facebook to close down her account and to take steps to ensure she isnât able to open another account. If that doesnât happen, he will seek an injunction to stop Facebook operating in Northern Ireland. The writ says the site is âguilty of negligenceâ and has created âa risk of sexual and physical harmâ to the vulnerable child. It also claims she has received text messages of an inappropriate nature from adult men who were asking her to post sexual messages and photographs of herself on Facebook. The child from Country Antrim, who cannot be named for legal reasons, is in care and suffers from behavioural problems. She allegedly posted the photographs and sexually explicit material on the site herself, giving personal details of her life, including the area where she lives and the school she attends. Action: The father warns he will seek an injunction ordering Facebook to close down her account and to take steps to ensure she isn't able to open another account . Her father said: âIâm taking this case against Facebook as a last resort. I was horrified when I saw the photographs my daughter had posted of herself on the site. âShe is far too young to understand what she is doing. She suffersÂ  problems and engages in self-destructive behaviour. She is currently receiving counselling.â The girlâs father claimed her current profile picture on Facebook was sexually suggestive, adding: âShe is wearing make-up and a low-cut top. Itâs completely inappropriate to show such a picture of a 12-year-old. âI am worried sick even thinking about the danger she could be in. There was another picture on Facebook of my daughter lifting up her top but thankfully that has been removed.â The man also revealed his daughter had a history of running away. âShe has done so several times,â he explained. âOnce she was found in a derelict house. My grave concern is that she would go off with someone she met on Facebook.â The fatherâs solicitor, Hilary Carmichael, has set up Childrenonfacebook.com, a website for parents who believe their youngsters may be at risk on the social network. She said: âI believe Facebook isnât suitable for under-18s but the company isnât even able to uphold its own policy of keeping under-13s out. If a child goes into an off-licence to buy alcohol or a shop to buy cigarettes, theyâre asked for ID to prove their age. âYet a child can join Facebook â and be exposed to a bigger population than that of the entire EU â without any ID being requested. An age check, like asking for a passport number, would be a simple measure to implement.â The writs lodged in Belfast High Court are against Facebook Ireland and Facebook headquarters in California. A writ has also been lodged against the health and social care trust in whose care the girl is residing. It alleges that the trust has been negligent for failing to prevent the child accessing Facebook.","Father claims the photos mean she is in danger of being targeted by paedophiles .

The savage riots last month could have led to the death of police officers, the Met has warned, after shocking new footage emerged of a mob attacking patrol cars with bricks and metal railings. The video shows hooded youths smashing in the windows of a police car with cafÃ© tables and chairs and hacking off a wing mirror. The frenzied attackers, wearing dark clothing and scarves over their faces, were filmed in Woolwich at around 8pm on Monday, August 8, wrecking the car with makeshift weapons including metal bars and street signs torn from the pavement. Frenzied violence: A gang of hooded youths smash up a police car as a bystander watches in horror . A brave bystander tries in vain to remonstrate with the group, before a policeman with a riot shield can be seen fleeing the violence. Further horrifying CCTV footage, shot . in the same area less than a minute later, shows one of the same boys hurling a concrete slab through the windscreen of an unmarked Met police car. Wearing a distinctive adidas hoodie, he screams wildly before reaching through the window to punch the driver, who was left with cuts to his face. Wanted man: The man who attacked the cars was wearing a dark hoodie with a blue or green adidas logo . Appeal: Rioters in Woolwich, south-east London, attacked police and set stores alight in August. The Met are now appealing for help in identifying the thugs . Last monthâs riots were the result of a âbroken penal systemâ that has failed to rehabilitate the hardcore âcriminal classesâ, according to Justice Secretary Kenneth Clarke. He revealed that almost 75 per cent of those aged over 18 charged with offences committed during the riots had prior convictions. Mr Clarke, pictured, said reform was vital to prevent reoffending among âa feral underclass, cut off from the mainstream in everything but its materialismâ. He also expressed concern at âthe instinctive criminal behaviour of apparently random passers-byâ. His remarks will be seen as bitterly ironic by Right-wing Tory MPs, who blame him for threatening their partyâs reputation on law and order with a series of âsoft sentencingâ policy proposals, which had to be overruled by Downing Street. Writing in the Guardian, Mr Clarke said: 'Itâs not yet been widely recognised, but the hardcore of the rioters were in fact known criminals. Close to three quarters of those aged 18 or over charged with riot offences already had a prior conviction.' He said he supported the judges, court staff and police, saying that rioters met a firm and speedy response, and praised those who worked 35-hour shifts to bring the guilty to account. Borough Commander Richard Wood said: âThe man in the footage could have seriously hurt or even killed one of the officers in the vehicle.' He condemned the 'extreme violence' as police released the footage of the episodes in Beresford Square and . appealed for information. Commander Wood said: âMembers . of the public have provided police in Greenwich with several . investigative leads in the past couple of weeks and we are very grateful . for all the help and support we have received. âHowever, we need more help and information to identify this violent individual. âIf you know who he is, please call us in confidence.â Police said officers could have died or been seriously injured during the attack in south-east London. Their primary suspect is a black man wearing a dark top with a hood and blue or green adidas logo. Witnesses are asked to contact police in Greenwich on 020 8284 9449 or Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111. Meanwhile, . as the effects of last monthâs riots took a heavy toll on retailers, . the High Street has recorded its worst results in two years. Shops reported a drop in profits of 2.2 per cent, according to accountancy firm BDO's High Street Sales Tracker. The . widespread looting and destruction saw stores including Comet, Currys, .

"By . Lee Moran . Last updated at 4:35 PM on 5th September 2011 . Hurricane Katia could soon hit the U.S. east coast - just days after Irene caused extensive flooding, and Tropical Storm Lee dumped torrential rain across the central Gulf. The Miami-based U.S. National Hurricane Centre said that yesterday Katia had intensified over the open Atlantic and was bulking up to a powerful Category 2 storm. But although the centre revealed it was still too soon to gauge the potential threat to land, most of its computer models predicted that Katia will veer, on a northeastern track, back out to sea later this week. Mass: This satellite image shows Hurricane Katia, from the International Space Station, churning in the Atlantic . Potential: Hurricane Katia intensified over the open Atlantic yesterday and was reportedly bulking up to a powerful Category 2 storm . Threatening: This satellite image shows Hurricane Katia, today, churning in the Atlantic . The centre said: '(Ocean) swells associated with Katia are already approaching parts of the east coast of the United States. 'Even if Katia does not directly impact the United States, the threat for high surf and rip currents along east coast beaches is expected to increase over the next few days.' At 5pm yesterday (9pm GMT), Katia had top sustained winds of 105 miles per hour and was about 365 miles north-northeast of the northern Leeward Islands. The centre said Katia could become a 'major' hurricane on Monday, with maximum sustained winds of at least 111 mph (178 kph). The uncertainty over the storm's definitive track came because of Tropical Storm Lee's presence over the Gulf of Mexico. Forecast: Hurricane Katia is expected to veer back out to the north-east and avoid hitting land . Models: Several U.S. states, including New Jersey and Vermont, are still recovering from extensive flooding caused by Hurricane Irene, which rampaged up the East Coast a week ago . It is not known how it will affect Katia's circulation later this week, forecasters said. Katia is the second hurricane of the June-through-November Atlantic hurricane season. The season is entering what has traditionally been its most active period. Several U.S. states, including New Jersey and Vermont, are still recovering from extensive flooding caused by Hurricane Irene, which rampaged up the East Coast a week ago. The centre of Tropical Storm Lee stretched across the central Gulf Coast yesterday, dumping torrential rains that threatened flooding in low-lying communities in a foreshadowing of what cities further inland could face in coming days. Lee's centre crawled ashore in Louisiana before dawn after the vast, soggy storm system spent hours during the weekend hovering in the northernmost Gulf of Mexico. Flooding: Kenneth LeCompte rides through flooded streets with his son Aidan, 4, as Tropical Storm Lee slowly makes landfall in Lafitte, Louisiana on Sunday . By Sunday, at least six to ten inches of rain had fallen in some spots along the Louisiana and Mississippi coasts, and the National Weather Service warned there was a threat of extensive flooding and flash floods because of the storm's slow, meandering jog inland. The drenching rain bands were expected to head northward into the Tennessee Valley later in the week as forecasters warned that 10 to 15 inches of rain were possible along the central Gulf Coast and up to 20 inches in isolated spots. National Hurricane Center specialist Robbie Berg said the flash flood threat could be more severe as the rains moves from the flatter Gulf region north into the rugged Appalachians. Closer to the Gulf, the water is 'just going to sit there a couple of days,' he said. 'Up in the Appalachians you get more threat of flash floods - so that's very similar to some of the stuff we saw in Vermont.' Vermont is still cleaning up and digging out dozens of communities that were damaged and isolated by heavy rain from Hurricane Irene last week that quickly overfilled mountain rivers. Lashing: Rick Porche walks through his flooded yard after Tropical Storm Lee crawled onto southern Louisiana's coast on Sunday . Storm path: This chart shows how Tropical Storm Lee is excpected to crawl across the South . Threat level: Vast swathes of Louisiana, Alabama, Georgia, Tennessee, Mississippi are under warnings . Heavy rain: Rainfall was forecast for the region . No injuries were reported so far from Lee. But even before Lee swept ashore, there were scattered instances of water entering low-lying homes and businesses in Louisiana's bayou country - a region of fast-eroding wetlands long vulnerable to hurricanes and tropical storms. The storm prompted evacuations in bayou towns such as Jean Lafitte. Thousands were without power. Late on Saturday, lifelong Jean Lafitte resident Brad Zinet was riding out the storm in his mobile home mounted on pilings. He was hoping it wouldn't take on water. 'We got nowhere to go. We're just getting everything put up out of the way and hope for the best,' said the 31-year-old plumber. 'This is a way of life around here,' he added. 'You just do the best you can and ride it out.' Waves: Residents walk between beach houses inundated with high surf in Dauphin Island, Alabama, on Sunday .

A week after Hurricane Irene caused massive flooding and claimed at least 46 lives as it barrelled up the east coast, President Barack Obama headed to northern New Jersey yesterday, for a first-hand look at the damage while keeping an eye on Lee. Although Lee is expected to weaken in coming days, the system was expected to unleash heavy rains over a wide area of the central Gulf Coast and then spread that precipitation into the Tennessee Valley, forecasters said.

Alabama beaches that would normally be packed for the Labor Day holiday were largely empty, and rough seas closed the Port of Mobile. Mississippi's coastal casinos, however, were open and reporting brisk business. In New Orleans, sporadic downpours caused some street flooding Saturday, but pumps were sucking up the water and sending it into Lake Pontchartrain. Officials said the levees were doing their job in the city that is still recovering from the deadly Hurricane Katrina a half decade ago. New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu warned residents not to let their guard down, saying: 'We're not out of the woods. Don't go to sleep on this storm.' To the east, coastal Mississippi officials were bracing for the storm to move further into the state. 'We've been getting some pretty good onshore rains,' said Jackson County emergency director Donald Langham. Harrison County officials said travel on U.S. Highway 90 had become hazardous because winds from Lee have pushed sand from beach onto the eastbound lanes and the rain has created a situation where drivers cannot see the roadway.

Threat: Heavy rain clouds from approaching Tropical Storm Lee form over the skyline of New Orleans on Friday night . 'This layer of sand has gotten up on the highway and you can't determine if you're on the road, up on the median or the curb,' said emergency director Rupert Lacy. Flooding in Hancock County left several roadways impassable, and the rain on parts of Interstate 10 at times has been so heavy that visibility was down to only a few feet. In Alabama, rough seas forced the closure of the Port of Mobile. Pockets of heavy rain pounded the beaches Saturday, and strong winds whipped up the surf and bowed palm trees. But just a couple miles inland, wind and rain dropped significantly. Wet and windy conditions hovered over Dauphin Island, a barrier island in the Gulf, but conditions weren't too threatening, Mayor Jeff Collier said. High surf caused some roads to flood, but all were still passable Saturday afternoon. Precautions were taken to secure anything that could be swept away by wind or waves, and Labor Day concerts and other festivities were canceled. Beaches that would normally be packed were nearly empty. Making the best of it: Ernie Adams paddles his pirogue to his house after visiting his neighbors house in floodwaters from Bayou Barataria . Aftermath: Workers hand off sandbags to to to stop flooding waters from Bayou Barataria encroaching on homes and businesses . 'The weekend is literally a wash,' Collier said. 'It's really a shame that it happened on a holiday weekend.' Elsewhere, the National Hurricane Center said Hurricane Katia was trekking across open ocean about 365 miles (587 kilometers) northeast of the Northern Leeward Islands. No coastal watches or warnings were in effect with the storm so far out to sea. The center said Katia had top sustained winds of 75 mph (121 kph) and was moving at 12 mph (19 kph) with little change in recent hours.","Katia may be a 'major' hurricane later today .

Much of the country will see more cloudy and windy weather for the remainder of the week and temperatures in the mid to high teens, with an area of low pressure over the north of Scotland blamed for the foul conditions. Temperatures will climb out of the teens into the low 20Cs by the weekend in the south east, but continued gusts of wind means that it will feel cooler outdoors. TONIGHT: Scattered showers continuing for most overnight with more persistent rain at times for northern and western parts of the UK. The far southeast staying mostly dry with clear spells. Windy. TOMORROW: Blustery showers and sunny intervals, with showers turning heavy across Scotland and Northern Ireland. Driest and brightest across southern and eastern England. More persistent rain spreading form the west later . THURSDAY: Staying unsettled for most with further spells of rain or drizzle at times. Southeast England staying the driest and warmest. Winds strengthening again by Saturday. Source: Met Office . News of the spell of bad weather comes as it was revealed that Eastbourne is Britain's sunniest street. Burton Road in Eastbourne saw 1,934.5 hours of sunshine in 12 months - 42.8 per cent more than the 1,354.9 hour average. The research was carried out by energy firm HomeSun in a bid to find out areas with the most suitable homes for solar power. Michael Fish, who lives in . Eastbourne, told the Daily Telegraph: 'The shelter of Beachy Head means . that Eastbourne has a unique micro-climate that really is sunny all year . round.' Met Office forecaster Dan Williams said: 'Certainly today it's wet and windy - very windy on exposed coasts, with the south and west coast seeing winds of 50 or 60 miles per hour. 'Looking forward, it's looking quite unsettled for the rest of the week as well, and into the start of next week. 'On Friday, although we are are going to maintain quite wet and unsettled conditions, temperatures will be quite warm. Friday and Saturday in the south east and south coast we could see temperatures as high as 23C.' Asked about the rest of the month, Mr Williams said that we could expect to see more of the same, and that a north-south divide would emerge when it came to the weather.

Sixteen drenched sailors had to be rescued from a vintage ship after its mast snapped in two in near-gale force of the south coast. The 120-year-old ketch, a training ship, was off the coast off Portland Bill, Dorset, when it was caught up in 40mph gusts and blown perilously around. Its wooden 90ft tall mast broke in . half in the force seven winds and the boom, sail and rigging plunged . into the choppy 12ft seas. The . crew of 16 on the stricken yacht, who were all young adults, were . unable to retrieve the stricken mast in the poor conditions and called . coastguards for help. The Weymouth RNLI lifeboat rushed to the scene at around 5.35pm yesterday. None of the sailors were injured in the incident, although some were suffering from seasickness in the rough conditions. The lifeboat towed the stricken 100-ton wooden-hulled boat safely back into the harbour with the party remaining on board. Low visibility: Queues of traffiic were made to battle through the poor visibility caused by heavy rain on A40, West London yesterday . High winds also caused structural damage in places like Southend Pier, as trees were bent in the wind, while some came down altogether . The 105ft-long ship, called Leader, was originally built in 1892 and worked as a fishing trawler before becoming a sail training ship. It is now one of four vessels used by the Trinity Sailing Trust, which is based in Brixham, Devon, to help disadvantaged young people learn to sail. The vessel, which is on the National Register of Historic Ships, was sailing from Dartmouth to Weymouth as part of a training trip when the weather closed in 1.5 miles off Portland. The powerful westerly winds snapped the tall wooden mast in half, leaving just a short splintered pole. Andy Sargeant, coxsman of Weymouth lifeboat, said: 'The crew called Portland Coastguard reporting the vessel had dismasted and we launched the all-weather lifeboat. 'There was a force seven westerly wind and a 12ft swell so the weather conditions were difficult for them. 'By the time we got there, the crew had managed to lash the sail and rigging safely onto the port side of the vessel so they didn't bang and flap away. 'Nobody was injured, just a bit sea-sick and we towed it slowly back to Weymouth harbour.' Damage: Southend Pier in Essex was closed today after sustaining damage from a barge in high winds . We don't like to be beside the seaside! Holidaymakers struggle in wet weather at Plymouth Hoe . Struan Cooper, chairman of trustees at the Trinity Sailing Trust based in Brixham, said: 'We're not yet sure what the cause was, but the simple fact is that the main mast broke and went over the side. 'Not only the top part of the main mast but the top mast and the rigging went overboard as well. 'Fortunately most people on board were on the aft of the deck and nobody was hurt - not even a scratch.' In a separate incident Southend Pier in Essex - the longest pleasure pier in the world - will be closed today to allow engineers to assess damage from a contractor's barge tethered to the pier. A statement on Southend-on-Sea . Borough Council's website said the barge was forced into the pier by . high winds and a heavy swell. A council spokeswoman said the vessel had been moored alongside the pier to carry out scheduled maintenance work. 'The pier is not about to fall down, or anything like that, but it has caused some damage,' she said. 'They are just finding out what needs to be done and that is why it has been closed as a precautionary measure. 'It has not damaged the integrity of the pier structure itself but there are some repairs that need to be done.'

It is a rather ordinary English coastal city that hardly looks like the most attractive holiday destination for wealthy tourists from thousands of miles away. But an American couple who have just visited Plymouth for the 39th year running insist it is like 'heaven on earth'. Bill and Thelma Donald, who live in bustling Boston, Massachusetts, have spent three weeks in the Devon city every year since 1972. Lovers' paradise: Americans Bill and Thelma Donald enjoying their beloved Plymouth in 1943 and today . It holds a special place in their hearts because they met there in 1943, when Mr Donald, now 87, visited his future wife's hometown as an 18-year-old in the US Navy. Mrs Donald, 83, said she dreams about 'beautiful' Plymouth, whose landmarks include a lighthouse and an aquarium. Now the couple return each year to Plymouth, whose fort and pleasant countryside is more commonly enjoyed as a pleasure outing for coach trips from the South West and nearby Wales. Mrs Donald said: 'My heart is always here. I just love it. 'I dream about it all the time. You have the beautiful countryside in the background and the beautiful sea here. 'Itâs like heaven on earth. 'When I left the city was completely destroyed by German bombs, now itâs just beautiful.' Mrs Donald, who was born in the city's Prince Rock, became friends with Mr Donald over the 14 months he spent there, after she met the young Coxswain playing baseball in one Plymouthâs parks. They remained in contact after Mr Donald was re-deployed on the US Navy destroyer USS Niblack in the Pacific.In 1947, when Mrs Donald was 18, she received a telegram from her sweetheart that would change here life.'We wrote to each other all the time and then one day he said to me in a telegram, ""swim on over here I want to marry you"",' she said. 'Within no time at all, I sailed over to New York on a steamer, which took 10 days. 'Bill was sitting on the dock waiting for me. We married 10 days later on December 16, 1947.' While the couple focused on family life and their three children for the next 25 years, in the summer of 1972 they made the trip they would repeat for nearly four decades. 'We just love all of this,' added Mr Donald, 87, gesturing at Tinside lido. 'We always come back to the Hoe and Tinside because it brings back so many memories. 'Dream holiday': The lighthouse and lido are two tourist favourites in the Donalds' holiday destination of choice . 'Thelma learned to swim at Tinside. 'To us this is the best place in the world. Everyoneâs so friendly and helpful, you just canât fault it.' At first, the couple stayed with Mrs Donaldâs parents in the Prince Rock area. But when her mother and father died, the American pair began staying at Citadel House hotel on the Hoe - where they have spent every visit since. Wish we were here: For this couple, Plymouth is the most beautiful place in the world . Norma Simpson, owner of Citadel House, said she sees them as family. 'They're amazing,' she said. 'They have the same suite in the hotel every year and very much have the same sort of routine. 'They go to the open air swimming pool at Tinside every day and Thelma swims several times a day - whatever the weather. 'They're incredible. They're old friends to us - almost like family now. 'We very much look forward to seeing them. All the staff know them. It's wonderful, really.'

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 9:54 PM on 6th September 2011 . A pilot was talking with her boyfriend by radio before their planes collided in mid air over Alaska last week, killing him, a federal investigator said. The two pilots took off from separate Alaska villages Friday but met up in the air on the way to Bethel, Alaska, National Transportation Safety Board investigator Clint Johnson told the Anchorage Daily News on Sunday. Kristen Sprague, 26, was flying a Cessna 207 operated by rural freight carrier Ryan Air, according to Alaska State Troopers. Tragic flight: Scott Veal, left, was talking to his girlfriend Kristen Sprague, right, via the radios on their planes when they collided in mid air . Victim: Scott Veal was piloting his Cessna 208 Caravan, which crashed and burst into flames Friday near the village of Nightmute, Alaska . She made an emergency landing with one airplane wing seriously damaged and wasn't hurt. The other plane, a Cessna 208 Caravan, crashed and burst into flames Friday around 1:30 pm near the village of Nightmute, Alaska, about 400 miles west of Anchorage, Alaska, killing Scott Veal, 24, of Kenai, Alaska. Each was the only person on-board. It was the state's third midair crash since July. A federal accident investigator has said two earlier mid-air collisions were marked by the same factor: aircraft that were difficult to spot amid mountainous terrain. In Friday's collision, the two pilots were travelling together to Bethel and were communicating on a prearranged radio frequency while in the air, Johnson said. It's too early in the investigation to say whether pilot error was a factor in the crash, he added. Tragic: A Cessna 210, similar to that flown by the pair, who collided in mid air while talking over the radio to each other . Terrain: The crash occurred near the village of Nightmute, Alaska, about 400 miles west of Anchorage . Sprague had taken off from the Bering Sea village of Tununak, Alaska. She was headed to Bethel with about 50 pounds of aluminium cans for a recycling program, said Wilfred Ryan, president of Ryan Air. Veal left from nearby Toksook Bay, Alaska, in an airplane operated by Grant Aviation, an air taxi and cargo carrier. Efforts by the Anchorage Daily News to speak with a Grant representative were unsuccessful. Sprague, of Idaho, told the investigator she was dating Veal, who reportedly was going through a divorce, Johnson said. 'They meet up in the air,' Johnson told the Anchorage Daily News. 'There's some manoeuvring that's done en route at about 1,200 feet (above sea level). The 207 pilot loses track of where the 208 is.' Sprague remembered saying over the radio something to the effect that she couldn't see him. Pilot dreams: Scott Veal's grandfather says the 24-year-old always dreamed of becoming an Alaska bush pilot . 'The next thing she knows is his air-plane strikes her right wing, and nearly severs the right wing,' Johnson said. The bigger plane passed underneath the Cessna 207 and came out on the left side of it, Johnson said. Sprague saw it spiral down, hit the tundra, and burst into flames, Johnson said. She managed to land her plane on soft rolling tundra, about a mile away. Wreckage from the Cessna 208 was strewn over a half-mile or more. Johnson said investigators still need to review data collected on the Ryan Air plane and that the other plane didn't collect similar data. Veal was from Southern California and always dreamed of becoming an Alaska bush pilot, his grandfather, Robert Veal, told the Anchorage newspaper. 'It's in the family. His father and myself are both flight instructors,' the grandfather said by phone from Winchester, California.

A celebrated former ballerina was told by the countryâs mostÂ  senior judges yesterday that the State has no duty to provide her with a helper so she can live with dignity in her own home. Stroke victim Elaine McDonald â once described as Britainâs best classical dancer â lost an appeal to the Supreme Court for a night-time carer. Judges, with one exception, said she had no right to demand a helper and that social workers were within the law when they withdrew the carer to save Â£22,000 a year. Elaine McDonald, 68,Â  lost an appeal at the Supreme Court yesterday.Â  The former ballerina (pictured performing in Swan Lake in 1983) said she needed an overnight carer to help her keep her 'dignity' Coming at a time of massive spending . cuts, the test case cleared the way for local authorities across the . country to reduce the help they provide to the elderly and disabled so . they can remain in their own homes.

The ruling brought an angry response from the dissenting judge, Lady Hale. She . said: âWe are, I still believe, a civilised society. I would have . allowed this appeal. In the United Kingdom we do not obligeÂ  people who . can control their bodily functions to behave as if they cannot do so. âI . am troubled by the implications of the (majority) view. A person in her . situation needs this help during the day as well as during the night. âLogically, . the decision of the majority in this case would entitle a local . authority to withdraw this help even though the client might be left . lying in her faeces until the carers came in the morning. âThis is not Miss McDonaldâs problem at the moment, but her evidence leaves one in no doubt that this is one of her fears. âIndeed, . the majority view would also entitle an authority to withdraw this help . during the day. The only constraint would be how frequently (or rather . how infrequently) it was deemed necessary to change the pads or sheets, . consistently with the avoidance of infection and other hazards such as . nappy rash. âThe consequences do not bearÂ  thinking about.â The . clawback, in which social workers have gradually set higher and higher . thresholds of illness andÂ  disability before people are allowed help, . has been detailed by the Daily Mailâs Dignity for the Elderly . campaign. The Supreme Court . decision means further cutbacks are certain to come for 557,000 people, . 368,000 of them elderly, who rely on help at home at the discretion of . local authority social workers. The ruling by five judges brought fierce criticism from charities. Michelle . Mitchell of Age UK said it was âshamefulâ and added: âOlder people have . a fundamental right to dignity. This judgment opens the door to . warehousing older people in their own homes without regard to their . quality of life.â Fight: Kensington and Chelsea council said Ms McDonald should use pads at night even though she is not incontinent . Miss . McDonald, who was prima ballerina for Scottish Ballet and received an . OBE in 1983, had a stroke in 1999 which left her with âseverely limited . mobilityâ. She has no children, and her partner, theatre lighting designer Donald McLeish, used to help at night but can no longer do so. The . Supreme Court judgment said Miss McDonald âsuffers from a small and . neurogenic bladder which means she has to urinate some two to three . times a nightâ. She has until now âaccessed a commode with the help of a carerâ provided by the London borough of Kensington and Chelsea. The . judges recognised that in her opinion âthe thought of being treated as . incontinent (which she is not) and having to use pads is an intolerable . affront to her dignity.â But . the majority of the judges said the council was free to change its . âcare planâ for Miss McDonald and that it was free to decide what her . needs were. The Supreme Court sits in London and is the UK's highest court . They found that . the councilâs social workers had not infringed Miss McDonaldâs right to . privacy and a family life under Article Eight of the European human . rights convention â a clause that has nevertheless allowed hundreds of . foreign criminals to escape deportation. Miss . McDonald said: âI have paid my dues since I was 16 â I am not a . scrounger. But now I need care and that is being denied me. And I fear . that my case will be used by other councils against other people so they . donât have to provide them with the care they need. âThat idea is horrific. âI have the right to live with dignity,â she added. âAnd . for me that means to be able to go to bed knowing that I have the help I . need to go to the toilet in the middle of the night. Having night-time . care would give me the freedom not to worry all day about what will . happen at night.â Elaine McDonald, once a starÂ  performer in a profession which demands supreme physical fitness, now needs day and night help to lead a decent life. Even the Supreme Court judges were moved by her plight. They began their explanation of their decision with the words: âIll health can be dreadfully cruel.â Miss McDonald, however, has not yet lost her dignity nor the determination that once made her one of the countryâs top classical dancers. She said that in the aftermath of her stroke in 1999 âthe doctors told me I would never walk again. They had never come across the determination of a ballerina. âNow I can walk if someone is there to supervise me.â Born in Leeds in 1943, she trained at the Royal Ballet School and by the 1980s was considered the best ballerina in the country. She shares the ground floor flat in West London where she has lived for 40 years with her cat Mi Fun. Theatre photographs and ballet posters decorate the walls. Her 57-year-old partner Donald McLeish, a theatre lighting designer, provides her with some help but has moved out after having a nervous breakdown. She must rely on others for almost all her needs and used to have a care âpackageâ that meant someone was there to help around the clock. But this has been scaled down to four time slots. A carer attends between 8.30am and 10.30am, from 1pm to 2pm, from 5pm to 5.30pm and from 8pm to 8.30pm. She must rely on her partner or friends at other times. Mr McLeish said of Kensington and Chelsea Council: âThey determined that she needed night-time care. Now they are ignoring their own expert advice. âI have done my best to look after Elaine but I suffered a nervous breakdown due to the strain.â","Ruling is 'shameful' says Age UK .

"By . Mark Duell . Last updated at 6:32 PM on 6th September 2011 . The father of classical piano group the 5 Browns sexually abused his three daughters far more times than he was convicted for, police revealed today. Keith Brown, of Utah, was jailed for at least 10 years in March after pleading guilty to abusing his Mormon daughters Deondra, Desirae and Melody when they were children. But a new police report says the abuse was over a period of at least eight years, happened hundreds of times for at least one of his daughters and was across state boundaries. Scroll down for video . Sentenced: Keith Brown, the father of the renowned piano group The 5 Browns, pictured with attorney Steven Shapiro, was jailed in March for at least 10 years on charges of child sex abuse . Brown had emailed his daughters about . the abuse before they went to police, the report said. The 5 Browns are a classical piano group made up of three sisters and two brothers - Melody, Deondra, Desirae, Ryan and Gregory. They were the first family of five siblings to be accepted at the same time into New Yorkâs Juilliard School. The Utah siblings released three albums that got to number one in the U.S. classical chart. The New York Post described them as âthe biggest classical music sensation in yearsâ. Entertainment Weekly said they are âbutton-down cute and somewhat otherworldlyâ. They have performances coming up in New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania in November - before going to Ohio in December. As one daughter got older he focussed on his younger girls, Deputy Utah County Attorney David Sturgill told the Salt Lake . Tribune last week. His crimes were close to being kept a . secret from the public and were only uncovered by the media following a car accident near Salt Lake City that he was involved in just days . after he was charged. Brown drove his Porsche off a road and . it fell 300ft into the Little Cottonwood Canyon as he returned from . a ski resort on Valentineâs Day with his wife - with police saying he was travelling too fast. He was driving, and his wife Lisa, the mother of the children, was in the passenger seat. They were both knocked unconscious, but Brown woke up and managed to dial 911. His lawyer Steven Shapiro has since reflected on the case following the sentencing. âThe position of a case of this . magnitude was to have it resolved as quickly and quietly as possible,â he told the Salt Lake Tribune. âThe intention was to not have this be . any sort of a media event.â Sexually assaulted: The Brown daughters only wanted to see their father jailed for a certain amount of time . Mr Sturgill said he would rather sexual assault cases were not covered by . the media - but a support group disagreed. Alana Kindness, executive director of . the Utah Coalition Against Sexual Assault, told the Salt Lake Tribune . she was very grateful to the young women for coming forward. 'The position of a case of this . magnitude was to have it resolved as quickly and quietly as possible. The intention was to not have this be . any sort of a media event' Steven Shapiro, defending . âIt doesnât matter what neighbourhood . they come from or what family they come from,' she said. 'It helps break down those . misconceptions about who perpetrators are and who the victims are.â The three daughters first met with . police in June 2010. But many people close to the family already knew . about the abuse before they came forward, Mr Shapiro told the Salt Lake . Tribune. âThe girls spoke with investigators . significantly after their father had already spoken with his . ecclesiastical leaders and had a conversation with his family,â he said. Brown pleaded guilty in February to one count of sodomy on a child and two counts of sexual abuse of a child. Mr Sturgill said the charges did not . represent the number of abusive acts committed - but the women only . wanted to see him jailed for a certain amount of time, so they got what . they wanted. A family torn: Mormon piano group The 5 Browns - left to right: Melody, Ryan, Desirae, Gregory, and Deondra . A spokesman for the 5 Browns told the . Salt Lake Tribune they are now focusing on âmanaging their lives, . careers and the ongoing healing processâ. Judge David Mortensen said in March: . 'I think itâs obvious a home should be a refuge and a safe place, and . that a parent should be a protector.â He added that Brown was a 'danger . to societyâ. âThe girls spoke with investigators . significantly after their father had already spoken with his . ecclesiastical leaders and had a conversation with his family' Steven Shapiro, defending . The girls were abused on separate occasions between November 1990 and October 1992, November 1990 and November 1992, and March 1997 and March 1998 in Utah County. Brown's daughters did not attend court for the sentencing as they were on tour in Florida. The 5 Browns are a Utah piano-playing group consisting of three sisters and two brothers. The Brown women severed their professional relationship with their father in October 2008. He was once their manager but now has no connection to the group.

"By . James Tozer . Last updated at 10:36 AM on 7th July 2011 . It was an announcement that carried with it all the depressing hallmarks of a feckless broken family in the making. After a relationship at school teenagers Michael Fernandes, 13, and his 15-year-old girlfriend Cheryl Holden revealed they were expecting a child. Their families were horrified. Yet, almost a decade on, the couple have defied the nay-sayers and turned the negative stereotypes on their head. Setting an example: Cheryl Holden, 24, and Michael Fernandes, 22, with children Archie, 11 months, Liam, eight, and Bryan, three . Not only are they still together, they have added to their family and now plan to marry. And, shunning a life on benefits, after staying at school to pass his exams, Michael has worked full-time to support his family. When little Liam arrived in 2003, Cheryl, by then aged 16, left school but attended council-run classes for teenage mothers while living at home in Rochdale, which has an above average teenage pregnancy rate. Michael, who was then 14 and also lived with his parents, stayed on to pass six GCSEs, including one at A grade. He began working as soon as he was able, first washing dishes at a restaurant after his classes. 'He'd come home from school, spend time with me and Liam, change out of his school uniform and go to work as a dishwasher,' Cheryl, now 24, said yesterday. Cheryl, aged 16, and Michael, aged 14, outside his mother's house with their son Liam, aged two months, in 2003 . Since then he has never spent more than a week on Jobseeker's Allowance, and for the past three years has been getting up at dawn to work as a landscape gardener. Cheryl has been a full-time mother since sons Bryan - now three - and 11-month-old Archie arrived. In 2009, Michael, now 22, proposed and the couple are taking part in a competition with a local radio station to win an all-expenses-paid wedding next month. 'Obviously we've done things backwards - it would be better to start a relationship, get married, buy a house and have children,' said Michael. 'Liam's eight now, it won't be long before he's the age I was when we had him. When he is I'll tell him he needs to wait, get a good education, go to university, and then when he has a family he'll be able to provide for them better than we've been able to.' The couple put their success down to their supportive families.âEverybody said, âYouâll never last with a young childâ,â Michael added. âWe showed everyone.â And the pair have been determined to get by without hand-outs.Â  âYou should be able to support your own children and not rely on other people,â said Michael. âI always thought, âTheyâre my children, I should take care of themâ.â The couple have been shortlisted for the wedding prize by Rock Radio.âWeâre more inclined to spend money on the kids than save up for the wedding,â said Cheryl. âThatâs why winning would be so great.â Despite friends and family telling the young couple, pictured in Spain in 2007, their relationship would not last, nine years on - and after two more children - the couple are still together and ready to tie the knot .","Michael Fernandes and Cheryl Holden have since added two more children to their family .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 5:07 PM on 7th July 2011 . The Government appears to have bowed to pressure from Labour and pushed the decision on Rupert Murdoch's bid to take over BSkyB until Septmber. News Corp already owns 39 per cent of BSkyB and is trying to acquire the rest. The deadline for submissions on whether to approve Murdochâs controversial Â£10billion bid is at noon tomorrow, but there have been widespread calls for the process to be suspended in the wake of the phone hacking scandal. According to the The Financial Times, the Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt, who has quasi-judicial control of the bid, will now not give his decision until September. No change: Baroness Rawlings ruled out calling a halt to the BSkyB takeover bid, being run by Jeremy Hunt, right, despite the deepening phone hacking sandal . In the House of Lords today, shadow . Lords leader Baroness Royall of Blaisdon tabled an urgent question . warning that refusing to suspend the process would be seen as . 'incomprehensible both by the public and by News Corporation's . advertisers and investors'. Government spokeswoman Baroness Rawlings seemed to refuse to budge from the position set out by David Cameron yesterday, maintaining that the hacking scandal does not affect the unrelated issue of the takeover. She said: 'The Culture Secretary (Jeremy Hunt) takes the view that News Corp have offered serious undertakings and discussed them in good faith in all circumstances. 'And given that the implementation of those undertakings will be overseen by the monitoring trustee and thereafter monitored and if necessary enforced by the OFT (Office of Fair Trading), he takes the view that there are sufficient safeguards to make certain compliance with the undertakings.' In reply to Lady Rawlings' short statement, Lady Royall said: 'I think the House, and indeed the country, will know that that is the wrong answer.' The phone hacking scandal continued to hit BSkyB's share price, which slid another 12p today, dropping 1.45 per cent to 815p. Mr Hunt had been expected to give the green light to the deal this month, clearing the way for Mr Murdoch to seize full control of the satellite broadcaster. Clash: Ed Miliband attacked David Cameron in the Commons yesterday, claiming the public would 'react with disbelief' if the deal went ahead next week . But Government sources last night . indicated that a decision would be delayed until at least the autumn . after a consultation on the deal was deluged with complaints from the . public. Lady Rawlings appeared to support that today when she said there was not yet a date set for the final decision and that Mr Hunt 'would not be rushed on his decision'. Mr Hunt has received around 100,000 submissions to consider before he reaches a final decision. A spokesman for the Department for Culture, Media and Sport said a more accurate figure would be available after the consultation process ends at noon tomorrow. Mr Hunt paved the way for the deal to go through last month when he agreed beefed-up proposals that will see Sky News run as an independent company to allay fears that the deal would give Mr Murdoch's News Corporation too much control of the media. He will make the final decision on whether to wave through the merger once and for all or refer it to the Competition Commission after the consultation period ends at noon tomorrow. Deepening scandal: Will phone hacking accusations scupper Rupert Murdoch's BSkyB buyout as it nears the final hurdle? News Corp's bid already faced opposition . from rivals in the media industry and some politicians but the . phone-hacking scandal at News International has brought the deal even . more under the spotlight and yesterday Ed Miliband urged the Government . to refer it to the commission. He told the House of Commons: 'The . public will not accept the idea that, with this scandal engulfing the . News of the World and News International, that the Government should in . the coming days be making a decision, outside of the normal processes, . for them to take control of one of the biggest media organisations in . the country.' But the Prime Minister brushed off . his call and said the Government had followed 'absolutely to the letter' the correct legal processes over the bid. Ministers came under intense pressure . yesterday to formally suspend the bid pending police inquiries into . allegations of phone hacking at the News of the World, which is owned by . Mr Murdochâs News Corporation. Under fire: Rebekah Brooks (pictured) chief executive of News International, was defended by her boss Rupert Murdoch . Labour . leader Ed Miliband told David Cameron in the Commons: âThe public will . react with disbelief if next week the decision is taken to go ahead with . this deal at a time when News International is subject to a major . criminal investigation.â Mr Miliband said the deal should be referred to the Competition Commission to provide âbreathing spaceâ. The . Prime Minister said ministers had a duty to follow âthe correct legal . processesâ in considering the BskyB deal or face a potential challenge . in the courts. The Government consultation into the deal closes tomorrow and sources said ministers had a duty to consider all responses. Sources . pointed out that an internet campaign has generated almost 400,000 . complaints and said they would take âsome timeâ to consider. MPs on all sides yesterday called for a delay in the decision. In . a statement yesterday Ofcom said it was also 'closely monitoring' the . allegations as it it had a duty to be satisfied on an ongoing basis that . holders of broadcasting licences are 'fit and proper'. If they decide that News Corporation is not suitable this would delay any takeover. The . news affected share prices in both London and New York, where News . Corporation shares opened nearly 3 per cent down yesterday. And in London, shares in BSkyB closed down 19.5p at 825.5p last night. Rupert . Murdoch yesterday issued a statement calling the hacking allegations . 'deplorable and unacceptable', as he backed Rebekah Brooks to continue . as chief executive of News International - the UK arm of News Corp which . publishes the News of the World. 'I . have made clear that our company must fully and proactively co-operate . with the police in all investigations and that is exactly what News . International has been doing and will continue to do under Rebekah . Brooks' leadership,' his statement said. 'I . have also appointed Joel Klein to provide important oversight and . guidance and Joel and Viet Dinh, an independent director, are keeping . News Corporation's board fully advised as well.' Mr Murdoch's News Corp currently owns 39 per cent of BskyB but is keen to acquire the rest of the pay-TV group. News . Corp bid 700p a shares for BSkyB last year, valuing the company at . Â£12.3bn. However, independent shareholders of BSkyB have made public . their view that such a price would significantly undervalue the . broadcaster.","Baroness Rawlings tells Lords Jeremy Hunt 'will not be rushed' on decision .

The 16-year-old, from Kilmarnock, was charged with murder over the death of 13-year-old Jon Wilson. The schoolboy, from Gateside Place in Kilmarnock, was found with serious head injuries and was left fighting for his life after the attack in Queen's Drive in Kilmarnock in the early hours of Sunday morning. Victim: A 16-year-old, from Kilmarnock, was charged with murder over the death of 13-year-old Jon Wilson, pictured in a sailor's hat . He died at Crosshouse Hospital yesterday. His family are said to be 'devastated' at his death, a neighbour said. Hundreds of Facebook messages have also been posted online paying tribute to the schoolboy. Jon's aunt Irene Wilson paid tribute to her nephew. Tragedy: Jon Wilson died at Crosshouse Hospital, Kilmarnock, pictured, with his devastated family at his side . She told the Daily Record: 'Jon was a quiet boy who spent most of his time playing with his Xbox. He didn't run in gangs or bring any bother to his door. 'He was a generous boy and he would give you his last.' Cathy Jamieson, Scottish Labour MP for Kilmarnock, said: 'This is such a tragic waste of a young life' She said the family, who were at his bedside when he died, had 'no idea' why he was in the street at that time of night. The 16-year-old made no plea and no declaration when he appeared at Kilmarnock Sheriff Court and was remanded in custody. No date was fixed for his next appearance. Gillian Cochrane, a neighbour of the Wilson family, said Jon's death was a 'tragedy'. 'His family are devastated,' she said.

"By . Colin Fernandez . Last updated at 12:30 AM on 2nd September 2011 . For parents worried about lending . their precious car to their even more precious teenage children, it . sounds like the answer to their prayers. An . electronic system will be fitted to new Ford cars from next year that . will force young motorists to drive safely when they ask to borrow the . family motor. The system will limit the carâs top speed and even stop teenagers turning the volume up too high on the stereo. Key to safety: Ford's MyKey system will allow parents to limit the speed of the family car when their teenage children drive it . The . safety feature, which has already been dubbed âteenage modeâ, springs . into action when the young driver uses a special second car key. Officially known as MyKey, the system is programmable by parents, allowing them to set a top speed of between 45mph and 80mph. Once the car reaches a certain speed, a chime sounds, and the car plays a spoken warning to slow down. The system also features an early warning when the driver is running low on fuel. Neat: The MyKey system uses programmable keys . Another safety feature is âemergency assistanceâ in the event of a crash serious enough to trigger the passenger airbags. If . there is such a collision, the carâs on-board computer will send a . message through the mobile phone network to the emergency services. The . message will include the co-ordinates of the accident. It is not only âboy racersâ whose antics will be curtailed, but teenage girl drivers, too. Ford . cites research which shows that while excessive speed is the cause of . 30 per cent of accidents involving young male drivers, it is also the . cause of 21 per cent of accidents with young female drivers. Paul . Mascarena, Fordâs chief technical officer, said of MyKey: âItâs . targeted at young drivers, though it is useful for fleet operators as . well.â The car maker said . that it had feared the âelectronic spyâ would prove unpopular with . teenagers, but initial trials in America have proven otherwise.

A bride-to-be is staging a sit-in at her village church after her dream of walking down the aisle just like her mother, grandmother and great-great grandmother was shattered when the church announced it was to close. Emily Morton, 21, dreamed of being the fourth generation of her family to have a white wedding in the picturesque Victorian church. But just weeks before her big day, Emily was shattered when the vicar told her: 'Sorry your wedding is off - we are closing.' Protest: Emily Morton, pictured with grandmother Celia Murphy, is staging a sit-in at All Saints Church in Rhondda Valleys after the village church closed, dashing her hopes of becoming fourth generation of her family to walk down the aisle . Now she is one of more than 50 villagers . mounting an around-the-clock vigil at All Saints Church to keep it open . for her marriage ceremony. Tearful Emily said: 'I used to sit in the congregation and look around imagining the day when I would be floating up the aisle. Every little girl dreams about her wedding day. 'My great-great grandmother was married here in 1923 and I was desperate to carry on that tradition just like my mother and grandmother did. 'I was christened here and have been coming to the church all of my life.' Heartbreaking: 'I could picture every detail of my wedding. But now that has been taken from me', says Emily . 'I could picture every detail of my wedding. But now that has been taken from me at the last moment - it is heartbreaking.' Emily had booked her big day six months ago at the 126-year-old All Saints Church in Maerdy, Rhondda Valleys in South Wales. She always treasured the family album of pictures showing generations of her family smiling outside the church gates. Their wedding picture album shows her late great-great grandmother Sophia Ann Barkway in 1923, grandmother Celia Murphy, 61, in 1969 and mum Sarah Morton, 41, in 1988. But officials decided the church - opened in 1885 in memory of a mining disaster which killed 81 men - would close because it needs 'hundreds of thousands of pounds' in repairs. Emily was told by the vicar Andrew Davies just weeks ago that the church was due to close - even though it was booked for her September wedding. She said: 'All my dreams were shattered. 'My grandmother lives across the road from the church. I had planned to walk across to the ceremony in my wedding dress just like my Mum and Gran had done before me. 'I burst into tears thinking that's never going to happen.' But the battling bride-to-be is not giving up on her dream wedding. Since the last service on Sunday, Emily and other regulars in the congregation organised a sit-in to keep the church open. At least four sleep on the church floor at night - and during the day the church is busy with people bringing supplies and signing the protest book. Emily is hoping church authorities will have a change of heart so she can marry driver fiancÃ© Aaron Jones, 23, on 17 September. Second generation: Emily's grandmother, Celia Murphy, got married in All Saints Church in 1969 . If not she will have to book another village church more than five miles away - but it is half the size of All Saints. She said: 'Some of our guests may have to stand outside. I'll have to book a car to get me back and from the church too. 'The local choir was booked to sing as I came into the church. I don't suppose there'll be room for them.' Emily's grandmother Celia is also in the sit-in - and wept as she talked about the family's disappointment. Family tradition: Emily's mother Sarah Morton was married at the All Saints Church in Maerdy in April 1988, while her great-grandmother Sophia Ann Barkway was married there in 1923 . Celia said: 'I have always wanted to see Emily married here. 'As the wedding drew nearer we've all had butterflies in our stomachs. 'Now all that is gone. It is tragic and we want our church kept open.' Norma Williams, 67, one of the organisers of the sit-in, said: 'We want the Parochial Church Council to sit up and see how strongly people feel about this. 'Everyone in the community is supporting us. The local chip shop is even giving free fish suppers to the protesters sleeping overnight here.' The Parochial Church Council decided the church needed major repairs costing an estimated Â£400,000 and was becoming 'too dangerous' to keep open. Archbishop of Wales Dr Barry Morgan said: 'Nobody wants to see a church closed and my prayers are with members of All Saints. 'It is simply a matter of practicality and pooling our resources together.'","Dilapidated Rhondda Valley church is to close through lack of funds .

"By . Rebecca Camber . Last updated at 9:53 AM on 8th July 2011 . Shamed singer Pete Doherty has walked free from prison just six weeks into a six-month sentence for drugs charges following the death of a society heiress. The Babyshambles star has been allowed out on home detention curfew â which will see him wear a tag and confined to his home from 7pm to 7am â after serving only a quarter of his jail term. His early release has been branded an insult to the relatives of Robyn Whitehead, a member of the wealthy Goldsmith family. Doherty was convicted for possessing crack cocaine in a squalid weekend that ended with her fatal overdose. Mocking: Pete Doherty wears a judge's wig outside Snaresbrook Crown Court in London in April before he was jailed . And there was further anger yesterday . as it emerged the 32-year-old singer had taunted the family of Miss . Whitehead, 27, calling her filmmaker father, Peter, a âderanged old . sillyâ. In a blog posted just hours before he . was sentenced on May 20 â his third drug-related jail term â he claimed . the society beauty had begged him to inject her with drugs, to sleep . with her on acid and to indulge in âblack magic sex ritualsâ. Doherty uses his self-serving rant to . say he refused to allow Miss Whitehead, who idolised him, to use crack . or heroin, but admitting he once âbanged her upâ â helped her take drugs . â when he found her trying to inject with a blunt needle. He said he wanted to make sure . âshe did it safelyâ. The former Libertines frontman also spoke out for . the first time about his involvement in the death of Mark Blanco, 30, . who fell off a balcony in 2006 after being ejected from a party in . Whitechapel, East London, for belittling Doherty as a âhyped-up pop . starâ. Balcony fall: Actor Mark Blanco, left, fell to his death at a party attended by Doherty while glamorous Robyn Whitehead, right, died following an overdose . Miss Whitehead, granddaughter of . Green Party founder Teddy Goldsmith and related to socialite Jemima Khan . and Tory MP Zac Goldsmith, died on January 24 last year after spending . several days filming a documentary about the drug-addict rock star. Doherty was convicted after police found a DVD filmed by Miss Whitehead showing him smoking crack cocaine with his friends. But he refused to take any . responsibility for her death, instead blaming a âpropaganda campaignâ for suggesting that he led her astray. He claimed: âShe was a heavily . involved recreational user and abuser of substances. I did not lead her . astray at all. I loved her. I left her the day before she died p***** . off that I wouldnât give her any drugs. âShe asked me for years to inject . her, to score for her, to sleep with her on acid, to get into black . magic sex ritualsâ¦ never, never, never.â He went on to abuse her father, . saying: âRobynâs father texted me that I am a âcoward and a runtâ and . that I am to blame. She (Robyn) would be broken hearted if she knew that . I was not even invited to the funeral ... she was my best friend you . deranged old silly.â In the same blog, the singer also taunted Mark Blancoâs mother, Sheila, about her sonâs death. Doherty . was first arrested for possessing drugs in October 2005 and since then . has repeatedly admitted possession of class A substances. In 2008, . he served 29 days of a 14-week sentence in Wormwood Scrubs prison after . being arrested on drugs charges the previous year. In 2003 . Doherty admitted burgling the home of former Libertines bandmate Carl . Barat and was sentenced to six months in prison which was later cut to . two on appeal. While his former bandmates were on tour in Japan, . Doherty allegedly kicked down the door to Baratâs basement flat in Harley Street . and stole items including an antique guitar, laptop, video recorder, CD . player, harmonica and books. He wrote: âOr perhaps, Mrs Blanco, so . vocal in her condemnation of me in relation to her sonâs death ... perhaps sheâd be interested to know exactly what occurred that night? âMrs Blanco, your son was well liked . and well loved. The night he died he was intensely agitated ... He was . ejected from Paulâs flat because of his aggressive and loud attempts to . belittle me and assert his view that I was a hyped-up pop star. âWhen he left the flat he was alone and when he fell or jumped he was alone.â Earlier this year, after two Scotland . Yard investigations, the Crown Prosecution Service said there was not . enough evidence for a murder prosecution over the death of the Cambridge . graduate. But last night Mrs Blanco said she was considering a private prosecution against Doherty. She said: âIf he knew Mark was alone, how did he know? I think itâs very insulting in a way. âItâs a joke. Itâs the work of a coward deciding to say something when they are about to go to prison.â And she blasted the decision to release him early, saying: âIt feels like a celebrity privilege.â Rock: The controversial singer, of Camden, North London, has twice . been jailed before and has repeatedly admitted possession of class A . substances .

"Mark Deeley stabbed the German Shepherd after it attacked his pet Labrador . By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 11:20 AM on 8th July 2011 . A businessman who stabbed his neighbour's guard dog to death as the animal attacked his pet Labrador has been cleared of acting unlawfully. Mark Deeley was acquitted of a count of criminal damage after a district judge at Coventry Magistrates' Court accepted that the lettings agency owner believed his actions were reasonable. Mr Deeley, of Gibbet Hill, Coventry, told the court yesterday that he had been left with no alternative other than to stab the German Shepherd after it ran into his garden to attack his dog. Cleared: Mark Deeley was acquitted of a count of criminal damage at Coventry Magistrates Court after he stabbed his neighbour's dog . Mr Deeley, who turned 50 today, had been accused of acting disproportionately when he stabbed the guard dog, named Max, as it locked its jaws around his Labrador's throat. Clearing Mr Deeley of acting without lawful excuse, District Judge David Miller said the Labrador, named Bertie, was subjected to a serious attack which could have proved fatal. The judge, who reached his verdict after retiring for around 25 minutes, said: âMr Deeley, a dog lover, felt an immediate need to protect Bertie and he was also in fear of his own safety. âI have no reason to doubt that that fear was genuine.â Mr Miller, who stressed that the verdict in no way condoned the use of any weapon against a dog, said the forensic evidence in the case also proved that the attack on Bertie was on-going when Max was stabbed. Dog attack: Max the Alsatian, left, was stabbed after biting Bertie the golden Labrador, the severe nature of this injuries obvious in this photo . Speaking after the verdict, Mr Deeley expressed surprise that the case had been brought to trial. âIt has been an awful event from the very second that Max came through the hedge and attacked Bertie,â he told reporters. âI was surprised that it (the prosecution) got this far, particularly as everything happened on my property. âI just did what I thought was right to stop the attack.â Tearful: Tarlo Singh, who owned Max the Alsatian, arriving at Coventry Magistrates' Court for the hearing into the attack in Warwickshire . Mr Deeley told the court yesterday that he feared Max was about to kill his 12-year-old Labrador during the incident on November 26 last year. âAt that point I just did not feel I had any choice,â the businessman told the court. âThe intention was to disengage Max from Bertie and to immobilise the dog in such a way that it wouldn't come for me. âI used as much force as I saw was reasonable in order to prevent the attack. 'I just quite simply thought it was a brutal attack that was resulting in my dog being made ready to be killed.â Giving evidence in the trial, his neighbour Mr Tarlo Singh, 34, struggled to hold back the tears as he recalled the moment his dog was stabbed. He told the court he had been in the ensuite shower room when he heard the animal âyelpâ, before falling silent. Mr Singh said he opened his bathroom window and added: âI called Max over â by then I had seen Mark Deeley with a sharp object in his hand. I called Max over, but by then it was too late.â After a break to allow the witness to compose himself, Mr Singh continued: âAll I heard was a crying noiseâ¦I saw him stab the dog. I shouted to Max three times but got no response.â The properties stand in 1.5 acre plots of land on the outskirts of Coventry, overlooking greenbelt that separates the city from the Warwickshire town of Kenilworth.","Mark Deeley stabbed the German Shepherd after it attacked his pet Labrador .

Londonâs former mayor Ken Livingstone was joined by Shadow Olympics minister Tessa Jowell today to pay tribute to the 7/7 victims on the sixth anniversary of the bus and Tube bombings. They gathered at 8:50 am this morning, the same time that the first suicide bomb exploded on July 7, 2005, in the tragedy that left 52 commuters dead in total. Wreaths were laid at the Memorial in Hyde Park by Home Secretary Theresa May and the London Ambulance Serviceâs deputy director of operations Jason Killens. Tribute: London's former mayor Ken Livingstone was joined by Shadow Olympics minister Tessa Jowell today to pay tribute to the 7/7 victims . Jowell and Livingstone recalled how they heard the news six years ago while in Singapore, after London was announced to be the host of the 2012 Olympics. Ms Jowell said: âWe immediately cut the celebrations to come back but the plane broke down and we were waiting for hours.â Mr Livingstone added: âWe found it really frustrating. We wanted to be back here.â The most deadly of the attacks claimed 26 lives on a Piccadilly Line train, just before 9am in peak hour. A memorial service for the victimsâ families was held at lunchtime today. Floral tribute: Flowers were placed next to a memorial remembering the victims of the London bus bombing terrorist attacks . We will never forget: People lay flowers at the memorial in Hyde Park, London on the sixth anniversary of the attack . Ms Jowell's tribute read: âWe will never forget youâ, while floral tributes were also left by London Underground staff and members of the Metropolitan Police. John Smith, who worked at the BMA and an eyewitness to the attack on the 30 bus in Tavistock Square, also paid his respects at the memorial. Meanwhile, survivors of the bombings also attended the memorial service to mark the sixth anniversary of the terror attacks. Around 100 people observed a one minute silence and laid wreaths at the memorial sculpture in Hyde Park.

Never forgotten: A note from a loved one is placed amongst flowers on the memorial in Hyde Park . Many travelled across the world to pay their respects. Nicola Stanley, who was on the Piccadilly Line train when one of the bombs went off said: âI remember the day clearly. âI couldn't help thinking, 'why am I still here?'. It felt so unfair. I read every newspaper article, watched every film and documentary to try and understand how anyone could do what they did and I came to the conclusion it was a pure act of evil. âLondon showed great strength after that day. They can never break our spirit. London is our city.â Another survivor, Jacqui Putnam said: âI never knew any of the 52 victims but one thing I do know is how much they were loved.

On the morning of Thursday, 7 July 2005, four terrorists, Hasib Hussain, Shehzad Tanweer, Jermaine Lindsay and Mohammad Sidique Khan, detonated four bombs, three on London Underground trains and a fourth on a double-decker bus in Tavistock Square. Around 700 commuters were injured during the attack, on top of those killed by the suicide bombers carrying explosives in their rucksacks. A London tube station evacuated at rush hour amid a chemical alert on the sixth anniversary of the 7/7 terror attack has been declared safe. Busy Monument station was evacuated when tube staff reported a strong smell of chemicals just before 8am. Several emergency service vehicles raced to the scene and traffic around the London Bridge area ground to a halt. However, after extensive tests were conducted by London fire Brigade investigators the station was declared safe and allowed to reopen at around 10am. The scare was put down to an ammonia spillage in a storeroom. A London Fire Brigade spokesman said: âWe were called to a confirmed chemical incident at Monument underground station.â Station Manager Daniel Alie said: âFirefighters carried out tests and found a small amount of ammonia had leaked in a basement storeroom. âThe ammonia wasn't at a harmful level. We're now satisfied that the area is safe and have handed the incident back to London Underground staff.â He added: Both Monument and Bank underground stations were evacuated as a precaution.

Police in Boulder, Colorado believe a young man's cat may have been killed by inhaling the powerful drug, after a neighbour allegedly blew heroin smoke in its face. As Fox31 Denver reports, Boulder police arrested Danielle Blankenship, 21, on Tuesday morning on charges of cruelty to animals stemming from the mysterious death of a cat named Muffin. Scroll down for video . Charged: Danielle Blankenship, 21, of Boulder, Colorado is accused of blowing heroin smoke in a cat's face. The animal died shortly after the alleged incident . Ms Blankenship is also charged with third degree assault and domestic violence. Police say they arrested the young woman after responding to a domestic violence call in the 1100 block of 30th Street Tuesday morning. They say Ms Blankenship's boyfriend had called them to report that she hit him in the face. Officers say the woman admitted punching her boyfriend because he wouldn't let her use his phone to . call for a ride. At that point, the alleged incident took a bizarre turn, after a female officer reportedly noticed the cat lying on the steps of the apartment building. Officer Gregory Perry wrote in a statement: 'The . cat appeared to be unresponsive, and the cat did not move when the . officer touched it. Bizarre: Muffin, the cat who died, had lived at the same apartment building in Boulder as Ms Blankenship . Ms Blankenship could face felony charges if a necropsy shows the cat was indeed poisoned by heroin . 'It . could not seem to get up'. Fox31 identified the cat as an animal named Muffin, and which reportedly belonged to a neighbour man, 24, who asked not to be named because he didn't want to be associated with an event that allegedly involved drugs. According to police, Ms Blankenshipâs boyfriend told them she had been smoking heroin and blew it in the catâs face. Ms Blankenship denies smoking heroin and denies that she blew smoke in Muffin's face. When police asked Ms Blankenship if the lethargic cat had been struck, she reportedly told them she would never hurt a cat. The police called animal control, who took the pet to the Humane Society of Boulder Valley. Owner: A 24-year-old man who lives at the complex was reportedly Muffin's owner. He asked not to be named . Boulder's finest: Colorado police noticed that Muffin wasn't doing well, and started asking questions . Boulder Police Spokeswoman Kim Kobel told Fox31: 'The vet clinic called the Poison . Control Center to try to find out if there were some specific things . they could do to revive the cat. 'They gave it some IVs, and the cat . rallied at one point. 'They . thought it was going to make it, but then it crashed soon after that and . it died about 6:30 last night. 'Our . animal control officers have seen poisoning before. They have responded . to cases where animals get into household cleaners, bleaches, and . things like that. 'This is an unusual case, if it actually is indeed a . drug poisoning like this, a heroin poisoning', Ms Kobel said. A necropsy is scheduled to be performed on the cat, to try to determine if it was killed from heroin. If that turns out to be the case, Ms Blankenship could face felony charges.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 6:05 PM on 7th July 2011 . Appeal: Colm Murphy has been granted a civil retrial over a high court ruling that said he was responsible for the Omagh bombing . The families of Omagh bomb victims have pledged to continue their legal battle after two men successfully appealed against a high court ruling which found them responsible for the outrage. Colm Murphy and Seamus Daly were both granted appeals by Belfast High Court today, with Murphy set for a civil retrial. Daly could also face similar proceedings. While Murphy and Daly were successful, challenges lodged by convicted Real IRA leader Michael McKevitt and fellow senior republican Liam Campbell over their liability for the attack were dismissed by a panel of three judges. While no one has been successfully convicted criminally for the 1998 bombing, all four men were held responsible in a landmark civil action taken by some of the families two years ago. Outside court Michael Gallagher, whose son Aidan was killed, said he accepted the findings of the appeal court but insisted he would see the retrial process through. 'We are disappointed, we have to accept the ruling of the court, which we do, but we are disappointed,' he said. 'It has been a long struggle for the families, almost 10 years, it looks like this work will continue for a number of years forward. 'It is not something that we look forward to but if we feel it is the right thing to do we will continue to do that.' Stanley McCombe, who lost his wife Ann, said: 'We will fight on to the bitter end.' Continuing their fight: Michael Gallagher, right, Stanley McCombe, centre, and his son Clive said they were 'disappointed' but would 'fight to the bitter end' He said he accepted it was unlikely . anyone would ever be jailed for the attack and reiterated family demands . for a cross-border public inquiry into the bombing and the subsequent . police investigation. 'It has taken us a long time to get here, all we are asking for is the truth,' he said. Lord Justice Malachy Higgins heard the appeal in January with fellow Lord Justices Paul Girvan and Patrick Coghlin. Delivering their reserved ruling to . the court, Lord Justice Higgins directed a retrial of the claims against . Murphy, from Dundalk, Co Louth, and said the court would hear arguments . on a potential retrial of Daly, from Cullaville, Co Monaghan, in the . autumn. The three judges questioned evidence surrounding emails from US undercover agent David Rupert in allowing Murphy's appeal. 'The paucity of the email evidence, . the lack of consistency in the emails or at least ambiguity, the . possibility of initials referring to someone other than Murphy and the . fact that they refer on occasions to double hearsay considerably . weakened the emails as evidence,' they said. ""The judge's (Mr Justice Morgan's) conclusion that it was cogent evidence is not sustainable."" Dismissed: Challenges lodged by Real IRA leader Michael McKevitt, left, and fellow senior republican Liam Campbell over their liability for the attack were rejected by the panel of three judges. On Daly, they said Mr Justice Morgan . appeared to have taken into account evidence that should have been . excluded and seemed to have given weight to inadmissible evidence of a . past conviction. 'Accordingly, his appeal will be allowed,' they said. Twenty-nine people, including a woman pregnant with twins, died when the Real IRA car bomb ripped through the Co Tyrone market town in August 1998. More than 200 were injured in the blast. In Belfast High Court two years ago, Mr Justice Declan Morgan, now Northern Ireland's Lord Chief Justice, found the four men liable and ordered them to pay Â£1.6 million in compensation. A separate bid by the families for that award to be increased was also rejected by the appeal court today. Atrocity: 29 people, including a woman who was pregnant with twins, were killed in the attack during August 1998 . Not all the bereaved relatives have backed the legal challenge and Kevin Skelton, whose wife Philomena died, said it had been a waste of time and money. 'At the end of the day it does not matter if the people are found guilty or not. They are not going to serve one minute (in jail),'he said. 'With regards to compensation, people will not get any money, it is a waste of time.' Only one man has so far faced a criminal trial over the outrage. In December 2007 Sean Hoey, from Jonesborough, South Armagh, was cleared at Belfast Crown Court of murdering the 29 people. He was acquitted of 58 charges, including some not directly linked to the bombing.",Judges dismiss appeal of convicted IRA leader Michael McKevitt .
"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 1:16 PM on 29th July 2011 . Venezuela's flamboyant socialist leader Hugo Chavez has confirmed he has undergone an operation to remove a cancerous tumor. The announcement, which confirmed rumours that had been circulating for nearly three weeks, shocked the South American OPEC nation ahead of what was already looking like a tight race for a presidential election next year. Speaking from Havana where he underwent surgery June 10, a pale and emotional Chavez gave no indication when he would return to Venezuela. Nor did he name a temporary substitute to lead the country of 29 million people. Venezuela's president Hugo Chavez looked pale and tired as he confirmed he had undergone an operation on June 10 to remove a cancerous tumour . A man in a Caracas bar listens intently to the president's televised speech . 'They confirmed the existence of a tumorous abscess, with the presence of cancerous cells, which needed another operation to extract the tumor completely,' he said in his first address to the nation since his surgery. Chavez, 56, said he was receiving 'complementary treatments to combat different types of cells that were found' - possibly implying chemotherapy. 'I deeply appreciate the demonstrations of solidarity by Venezuelans and other brotherly people,' he added, standing at a lectern by a Venezuelan flag and a painting of his inspiration, South American independence hero Simon Bolivar. Analysts say a prolonged absence could trigger infighting among his allies - none of whom possess Chavez's charisma or national appeal -- and possibly prompt calls for an early election by opposition parties gearing up for a 2012 poll. 'It is impossible to deduce if he will or will not be in a physical state and the right mood to go into the 2012 campaign,' said local analyst Luis-Vicente Leon said. As rumours about the president's health swirled, the Venezuelan government issued this shot of Chavez with former Cuban leader Fidel Castro reading a copy of the Cuban Communist Party newspaper Granma in Havana on June 28 . In contrast to his usual jocular and improvisational style, Chavez read a statement while frequently looking down at notes. He looked serious but not weak or debilitated. He recognized, maybe for the first time since taking office, that his health had been compromised by his leadership style, based on intense micro-management, constant coffee-swilling and little sleep. 'Throughout my life I've been committing fundamental errors ... of not taking care of my health and being reluctant about medical treatment,' he said. Until Thursday, the official line had been that he was recovering well from an operation to remove a pelvic abscess and would return soon. Inheriting former Cuban revolutionary leader Fidel Castro's mantle as Washington's main irritant in Latin America, Chavez has become one of the world's most well-known leaders during his 12 years in power. Comparing his health problem to a previous dark moment - a short-lived 2002 coup attempt - Chavez promised he would be back in typically grandiose language. 'I want to talk to you about the rising sun, I think that we have emerged,' he said. There were fireworks in the poor west end of Caracas, a bastion of Chavez supporters, and people on the streets shouted 'He's alive! He's alive!' Chavez has appeared to inherit Castro's mantle as Washington's main irritant in Latin America and has become one of the world's most well-known leaders during his 12 years in power . Others reacted with disbelief but vows of solidarity. 'My comandante doesn't have cancer. It can't be true. He is the best president we have had, a strong man. He is not ill,' said Santiago Valledare, a driver watching the speech and saluting the television screen at a Caracas bar. Chavez's ministers gave a joint appearance minutes after his speech ended, pledging to deepen his wide-reaching socialist reforms even in his absence and saying the government would remain united. 'This is not the time to go backward, it's time to advance,' Vice-President Elias Jaua said. Critics of the stalwart socialist responded to the announcement with a mix of snide glee and optimism about the chances for an opposition leader to take over after nearly a decade of failing to unseat him. 'This will lead to a transition of presidents. It's perfect!' said Freddy Herrera, 25, an accountant. 'Because the revolution doesn't work, because socialism is a lie.' His government has canceled a July 5-6 summit coinciding with Venezuela's 200th anniversary of independence. That was a heavy blow for supporters who wanted the charismatic but authoritarian president -- who loves to grandstand at such big events -- back home in time for the national party. 'This development may open a period of unprecedented social and political uncertainty in Venezuela,' Goldman Sachs analyst Alberto Ramos said in a note to clients.","Announcement confirmed rumours of ill health .

"By . John Stevens . Last updated at 2:01 PM on 8th July 2011 . Authorities in Florida are taking special measures in the release Casey Anthony in the wake of growing fears for her safety. In a statement, Orange County authorities said that due to the 'emotional interest by the public' they will be taking extra care when they release Anthony next Sunday. The news comes as the 25-year-old â who just days ago was facing the death penalty - will be released after being stunningly acquitted of the murder of her two-year-old daughter Caylee. But as the young Florida woman finally walks free after what will have been 1,043 days in prison, the public outrage at the verdict in one of the country's most high profile trials ever means she will face constant security fears. All smiles: Casey Anthony looked relaxed as she learnt that she will be released, but there are concerns for her safety . In a statement Orange County Corrections Department said:Â  'Due to the high profile nature of this case and intense, emotional interest by the public, appropriate measures will be taken to release the individual into the community in such a manner so as to preserve the safety of the individual and the public.' Anthony smiled and winked to lawyers at her sentencing yesterday as she was told that despite being given a four-year jail term, she would be released in just days, because of time already served and good behaviour. Wearing her hair down and looking more relaxed than she did while sat in the same Orlando court room during her sensational six-week trial, Anthony seemed like she was a woman preparing for release. Jailhouse letters reveal that Anthony has been dreaming of this moment for years, planning holidays on the beach, salon days to have her nails painted and just routine trips to the supermarket. 'Girl, I could use a day at Target myself,' she wrote to one fellow inmate. 'Just to walk around the store, to be a part of society. I want to go grocery shopping.' 'Color on my toesies and acrylic nails - yes please,' she added. 'I want to embrace the many joys of being a lady.' Shock: Disbelief can be seen on the faces of people in the crowd outside the Orange County Courthouse. One spectator held up a sign calling Casey a 'Baby Killer' Why does Casey get to have a life? Lori Richards, of Daytona Beach, Florida, joins a group of protesters outside the Orange County Courthouse for the sentencing . When Casey Anthony is released on Sunday she will be bound by the rules of her probation for one year, for a cheque-fraud charge she pleaded guilty to in 2010. Court documents reveal that the she must: . But the reality is that Anthony has . become the most vilified woman in America, condemned as a compulsive . liar and a heartless mother who partied and paraded herself in a 'hot . body' competition in the days after her daughter's death. She will never be able to live an anonymous life as a regular member of society again. Her defence team admitted they have fears for her safety and are considering hiring round-the-clock bodyguards. Outside the Orange County Courthouse yesterday as the date of Anthony's release was announced, the public's anger and disbelief was evident as protesters gathered to express their fury. The baying mob carried placards marked 'Why does Casey get to have a life?' and 'The jury got it wrong'. They repeated chants of 'Justice for Caylee, Justice for Caylee.' 'I feel she got away with murder and it really irritates me,' said Donna Marini, who has attended most of the trial proceedings. Public outrage has been building since Anthony was acquitted in one of the most controversial verdicts since the OJ Simpson case. Judge Belvin Perry pointed to the risk of reprisals for people involved in the contentious case this afternoon when he extended a ban on the identifying on jurors. He said: 'Our landscape in this country has changed. People have no reservationâ¦about walking up to an individual, pulling a gun or knifeâ¦.and because they disagree with them, hurt them or kill them.' Inside prison, Anthony spent nearly three years locked up 23 hours a day in protective custody, to prevent her being attacked. But outside, officials have refused to confirm how Anthony will be kept safe. Security risk: Anthony's lawyer Jose Baez said that he feared for her safety and that they were considering hiring bodyguards . Dreams of freedom: Casey Anthony wrote from jail that she is looking forward to re-joining society . Anthony's lawyer Jose Baez, who was at the centre of her shocking court victory, last night admitted he was scared for his client's safety. 'I am afraid for her,' he told Barbara Walters. 'And I don't think it's fair.' The real risk of retribution against the national hate figure means her defence team are looking at the possibility of getting her constant protection and a team of bodyguards. It is not clear where Anthony will go when she steps out of jail. Her parents, with whom she lived before her arrest, yesterday said they have still not decided if they will ever welcome her back. It seems impossible that she could . return to her parents' Florida home, after the trial ripped the family . apart with allegations of rape, incest and adultery. Grieving grandparents: George and Cindy Anthony broke down while giving evidence in the case . Security: Road blocks have been introduced around the Orlando home of Casey Anthony's parents . Tragedy: Many are angry that Casey Anthony has been cleared of the murder of her daughter . Anthony's parents have themselves become the subject of death threats since the jury read out its not guilty verdict. George and Cindy Anthony, who were the first to leave the courtroom on Tuesday, looking stony-faced, still have not had contact with their daughter since the decision. 'It's still sinking in,' their lawyer Mark Lippman told the Today Show this morning, adding that his clients had been through 'three years of a living hell'. The couple stood by their daughter from the day of her arrest in 2008 to the start of her trial. But on the opening day, Anthony's defence team told the court how George Anthony had molested his daughter as a child and forced her into covering up the death of two-year-old Caylee. The Anthonys said that their reputations have been 'destroyed' by the claims. 'Their lives will never be the same. This case has destroyed everybody's reputations,' said Mr Lippman. In Casey's handwritten jailhouse letters, she revealed that she had been thinking about creating a new identity. 'If you could change your name to any name, what would it be?' she wrote in one letter. 'I've been thinking about that a lot lately.' But whatever steps Anthony takes to try to protect her safety, as she prepares for her release, she knows she will never have the freedom she dreamed of.","Court preparing special release measures after fears for Casey safety .

"By . Tom Leonard . Last updated at 12:10 PM on 8th July 2011 . Questions: Gerry Adams interview tapes are being sought by prosecutors . Prosecutors in the U.S. are demanding that a university hands over to Britain taped interviews in which former IRA members purportedly accuse Gerry Adams of running a secret death squad. Researchers on an oral history project for Boston College obtained the testimonies from two convicted IRA terrorists between 2001 and 2006. Adams, president of Sinn Fein, has always denied being an IRA member, let alone heading a unit which â in kidnapping, torturing and killing suspected informants â carried out some of its most brutal acts. The interviews being sought by Northern Ireland police are with Brendan Hughes, who was head of the IRA in Belfast, and Dolours Price, who took part in the 1973 Old Bailey car bombing and the unsolved killings of at least four people. Both later fell out with Adams and Sinn Fein, criticising the Northern Ireland peace process. The college says the pair only agreed to talk on condition their taped confessions remained sealed and their identities protected until after their deaths. Hughes died in 2008, but Price is still alive. Lawyers for the college claim releasing the details âprematurelyâ would not only damage the peace process but break the IRAâs âcode of silenceâÂ  and could lead to âpunishment by deathâ. But Northern Ireland police want the tapes now, convinced they hold crucial clues to at least nine unsolved murders as well as kidnappings in Northern Ireland during the Troubles. Bombings: Dolours Price was in one of the interviews with Adams . Federal prosecutors have now asked a judge to order the university to comply under U.S. treaty obligations with the UK. Some of the testimony from Hughes has already been used in a book and TV programme. In his interview, he spoke about serving alongside Adams and claimed the Sinn Fein leader was involved in the 1972 murder of Jean McConville, a mother of ten from Belfast. Adams has denied being involved in the killing, claiming Hughes was ânot wellâ at the time he gave the interview.","Two convicted IRA terrorists told researchers in America of his involvement .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 9:51 AM on 6th July 2011 . David Cameron will today announce further details of British troop withdrawals from Afghanistan - and insists any short-term pull outs will be 'modest.' In a statement to the Commons following a two-day visit to Kabul and Helmand, the Prime Minister will reiterate his commitment to end the UK's combat role in the conflict by 2015. However, he stressed during the trip that any short-term pullouts would be 'modest', saying there would be no 'radical change' in numbers for the next year. David Cameron speaks during a press conference in Kabul, Afghanistan. He will today reiterate his commitment to end the UK's combat role in the conflict by 2015 . Some 450 mainly auxiliary British personnel are already scheduled to be withdrawn in the coming months. Weekend reports suggested Mr Cameron was to announce a further 500 next year. It comes as Mr Cameron yesterday called on the Taliban to enter talks - and said that the discussions in Northern Ireland . showed even 'those who maim and bomb can join the peace process'. His speech delivered his most direct appeal yet to Taliban elements . to join in with the political process. 'It is very difficult to reconcile with people who have been killing your own soldiers, or your own countrymen,' he said. 'To the Taliban, the message is very . clear: Stop killing, stop bombing, stop fighting, put down your weapons, . join the political process and you can be part of the future of this . country. Staying put: David Cameron will tell the House of Commons today that no more than 500 troops will leave before autumn 2012 . 'I have seen it in my own country, in . Northern Ireland, where people who were involved in trying to kill, to . maim and bomb civilians and police officers, army personnel and even . politicians have actually become politicians themselves and are involved . in the governance of that country. 'It can happen and the message to the Taliban is: you cannot win this fight, you are losing this fight.' The Government has been under pressure to follow the example of US President Barack Obama, who announced last month that 10,000 troops deployed as part of the so-called 'surge' strategy would be coming home by the end of this year, and another 23,000 next. After public concerns from a series of senior military figures, Mr Cameron has played down the prospects of a significant pullout soon. British levels - currently at about 9,500 - were 'not going to see a radical change for the fighting season of next year', he added. The Prime Minister's visit coincided with the death of another UK soldier, named last night as Highlander Scott McLaren of 4th Battalion, The Royal Regiment of Scotland. Tragedy: Highlander Scott McLaren of 4th Battalion, The Royal Regiment of Scotland who was found dead after disappearing from a NATO checkpoint . The 20-year-old had earlier disappeared from a Nato checkpoint in central Helmand, sparking a massive 17-hour search. Mr Cameron acknowledged the 'high price' the UK had paid in seeking to help stabilise Afghanistan and prevent it reverting to a haven for terrorists. At a press conference in Kabul yesterday, the Prime Minister restated his determination to have UK forces off the front line within four years. 'I have always been clear that the end of 2014 is a deadline. We will not be here in large numbers or in a combat role,' he said. 'If what we are doing was not working by then then I think you would have some serious questions to ask me.' He went on: 'This is a matter of judgement. It is my judgement that it is right for the British public to know, for the Afghan public to know, for the Afghan and the British military to know, that there is an endpoint to this. 'An endpoint after which we will still be training, we will still be helping, but we won't be in a combat role.' Mr Cameron insisted that the planned transition to Afghan security control in the provincial capital of Lashkar Gah later this month remained on track. 'I do believe it is the right time,' he said. 'Many things have to be got right to ensure that transition can be done properly. But I believe we are on track. It can be done.'","He is expected to say 500 British troops will leave next year .

The list of consumer complaints against the TSA over recent months may soon have to include theft, in addition to groping and racial profiling. That's because a Transportation Security Administration worker has been charged with two counts of grand theft for allegedly stealing electronics out of passengers' luggage, authorities in Florida said Thursday. According to the Broward County Sheriff's Office, Nelson Santiago-Serrano, 30, was caught by a Continental Airlines employee stealing an iPad from a suitcase in Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport's Terminal 1 on Monday. Mr Santiago-Serrano was allegedly seen trying to stuff the device into his pants, reports the Broward-Palm Beach New Times. Police say that after they arrested him on Monday, he admitted to stealing computers, GPS devices, video cameras, and other electronics from bags he was supposed to be screening. Cops say Mr Santiago-Serrano would then take pictures of the items, then list them for sale online. They say many of the items would be sold before he even finished his shift at the airport.

Police are asking people to come forward if they think they had something stolen, but they say chances of actually recovering the goods are not good. Mr Santiago-Serrano was released on a $4,000 bond Tuesday, though police say they may file additional charges against him soon. According to the Broward County clerk of courts, he does not have a lawyer or any scheduled court dates. He reportedly no longer works for the TSA, though he had started with the agency in January 2009. Recently, allegations had surfaced that TSA agents in Newark airport had engaged in racial profiling of passengers, by singling out Hispanic men for additional screening. One agent was disciplined and others received training after colleagues accused them of acting as 'Mexican hunters'. Meanwhile, a number of people have complained of being 'groped' by TSA agents during body searches.","TSA agent Nelson Santiago-Serrano charged in Florida .

A three-year-old twin girl has been killed after being crushed by a falling television as she played in the family garage. Several other items from a dresser also landed on Isabella Rodriguez at the home in Encinitas near San Diego, California. The child's mother, Silvia Burrell-Rodriguez, 20, said her husband was taking Isabella and her twin sister, Alejandra, outside to play and Isabella went into the garage at 6pm on Tuesday evening. Moments later the large and heavy television had fallen on her and inflicted fatal injuries. 'It wasn't even five seconds when someone runs in and tells me that she's on the floor bleeding,' she said. 'I called 911 but the operator doesn't understand me, I got really frustrated. I picked her up with my hands and I ran to the car.' Isabella was rushed to the nearby Scripps Encinitas Hospital. She was then airlifted to Rady Childrenâs Hospital in San Diego where she later died. The Sheriffâs Department has indicated that an investigation is being conducted with child abuse and homicide teams. Mrs Burrell-Rodriguez has since returned to the garage where Isabella was hurt, and was seen shoving the dresser where the TV once sat. 'The furniture had been there for three years already. In those three years they always played in that garage and nothing bad had happened to them, nothing,' she said. The television that landed on Isabella Rodriguez lies on the floor of the garage of the Encinitas home . Heartbroken mother Silvia Burrell-Rodriguez says her daughter was only alone for five seconds before the TV fell .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 1:19 PM on 8th September 2011 . America faced a fresh threat of another pounding from Mother Nature today as three extreme weather fronts began to sweep towards the coastline. Tropical Storm Nate sprang to life in the western Gulf of Mexico on last night, Tropical Storm Maria formed in the Atlantic and Hurricane Katia churned up surf along Bermuda and the U.S. East Coast, forecasters said. The trio of tropical cyclones . came during what is traditionally the busiest part of the . June-through-November hurricane season in the Atlantic basin. Cyclones: This satellite image obtained from the NASA/NOAA GOES Project shows Hurricane Katia (L) and Tropical Storm Maria (R) on September 7, 2011 . Thousands of Americans were fleeing the U.S. East Coast today after being ordered to evacuate during flash floods which have taken two lives. Heavy rains have seen severe weather warnings issued from Maryland to New York early on Thursday morning. In Derry Township, Pennsylvania, an elderly man trying to get water from his basement was killed when the house's foundations collapsed. A motorist in Elizabeth Township, Pennsylvania, was also killed after becoming trapped in their vehicle early on Thursday during extreme weather. Rescue: A woman and her dogs are recovered from their home as the remains of Tropical Storm Lee cause havoc in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania . Damage: A 500-ton crane carrying out repair work on the Washington DC National Cathedral collapsed as thunderstorms struck the city overnight . The National Weather Service issued several flash flood warnings early Thursday for parts of Maryland, Pennsylvania, New Jersey and New York. Mandatory evacuation orders were also issued across several parts of New York state as officials predicted the rain would worsen on Wednesday night and Thursday morning. 'At . this time of year we are essentially at the peak of the hurricane . season,' said John Cangialosi, a hurricane specialist at the U.S. National Hurricane Center in Miami. Tropical Storm Maria, the 13th named . storm of the 2011 hurricane season, was racing westward across the . tropical Atlantic, with tropical storm watches being issued for the . Leeward Islands, the U.S. National Hurricane Center (NHC) said in its . report late Wednesday. The NHC said the government of Antigua has issued a tropical storm watch . for the islands of Antigua, Barbuda, Montserrat, Nevis and Saint Kitts . in the Leeward Islands. At 11:00pm EST, Maria was located about 1,070 miles . east-southeast of the Leeward Islands and was packing maximum sustained . winds of 50mph, the NHC added. Maria was moving toward the west near 23mph, and . this rapid motion is expected to continue during the next 24 hours, the . NHC said. Gaining strength: Tropical Storm Maria, the 13th named storm of the 2011 hurricane season, is racing westward across the tropical Atlantic . Storm watch: At 11:00pm EST, Maria was located about 1,070 miles east-southeast of the Leeward Islands and was packing maximum sustained winds of 50mph . 'Interests elsewhere in the Leeward Islands, The Virgin Islands and . Puerto Rico should monitor the progress of Maria,' the NHC said. A tropical storm watch means that tropical storm conditions are possible within the watch area, generally within 48 hours. Meanwhile, Tropical Storm Nate formed in Mexico's Bay of Campeche, prompting the Mexican government to issue storm warnings for its coast from Chilitepec to Celestun. Nate was about 125 miles west of Campeche and had sustained winds of 45mph. It was forecast to strengthen into a hurricane by Friday and move slowly north and then northwest toward the Mexican coast, the U.S. forecasters said. Coastal residents in the warning area could start feeling its gusts and rain by Wednesday night, they said. 'Data from the Pemex oil rigs in the Bay of Campeche measured sustained winds of 43 mph gusting to 50 mph,' the U.S. forecasters said. Trajectory: Forecasters predict Tropical Storm Nate will make landfall in Mexico on Monday evening . Satellite: Coastal residents in the warning area felt Nate's gusts and rain on Wednesday night . Crude oil futures rebounded sharply, partly on fears that Nate could disrupt U.S. and Mexican oil and natural gas operations in the Gulf. Nearly 37 per cent of U.S. oil production in the Gulf remained offline from Tropical Storm Lee's trek through the region last weekend, the U.S. Bureau of Ocean Energy Management said. Katia weakened significantly in the last two days but was still a hurricane with 80mph winds, making it a Category 1 storm on the five-step Saffir-Simpson intensity scale. It was a Category 4 at its peak. Katia was centred about 335 miles west-southwest of the island of Bermuda and was expected to pass between the eastern U.S. coast and Bermuda by Thursday. Forecasters said the core of the storm would stay out to sea but Katia was wide enough that its outer squalls could reach the shores of Bermuda, a British territory and global reinsurance hub whose 70,000 residents were under a tropical storm watch. Danger: Even with Katia's centr likely staying well away from the U.S. coast, large swells will impact the East Coast the next few days . Taking a turn: Katia weakened significantly in the last two days but was still a hurricane with 80mph winds, making it a Category 1 storm . Katia generated large swells that kicked up the surf and caused dangerous rip currents along the beaches of the Eastern United States, Bermuda and parts of the Bahamas, the forecasters said. Once past Bermuda, Katia was forecast to curve eastward over open seas where it would pose no further threat until it nears Scotland on Monday. By then it will no longer be a tropical system, but could spread out into a larger storm. 'It'll likely be a very big, significant weather system,' Cangialosi said. 'It will evolve into a classic wintertime storm by the time it gets there.'","Tropical Storms Nate and Maria threaten Puerto Rico and Bay of Campeche .

Spencer Cullen, 23, is a woman who wants to become a man and allegedly helped take the cash from a Walmart store in Prescott, Arizona, so she could pay for the operation. Cullen, whose middle name is Danger, is still physically a woman but is said to have been preparing for the gender-swap for some time. Accused: Spencer Cullen, 23, (left) is a woman who wants to become a man and with Adriano Altiveros (right) they allegedly took the cash to pay for the operation . Adriano Altiveros, 19, bought himself a new car from his half of the proceeds, police have said. The Walmart, which is around around 80 miles north west of Phoenix, was robbed last Thursday and the pair were arrested a day later. 'Cullen told detectives that her motive for stealing the money was to go forward with a sex change operation that she had wanted,' Prescott police spokesman lieutenant Andy Reinhardt said. 'I don't believe that she had made arrangements at that point, but I do believe that she had already started the process to become a man. 'Altiveros assisted by distracting cashiers that worked just outside the cash office. Crime scene: The pair worked at U.S. giant Walmart and allegedly took the cash from its office . 'Through investigation and surveillance video, detectives determined that a key was used to enter a locked cash office where $45,000 in cash had been removed.' Both Cullen and Altiveros are in jail charged with felony burglary and theft. After the robbery, Cullen gave the cash to Altiveros, who then used $22,000 to buy a Toyota Supra car from a private seller in the Phoenix area, police said. The two suspects were being held in custody and police said today that all but 31 cents of the stolen money had been recovered. In a further twist, if convicted Cullen could choose to sue while in jail if she is not treated properly by the authorities. Boston murderer Michelle Kosilek, who is male, sued the Massachusetts Department of Corrections because he was not being adequately treated for gender-identity disorder. The judge ruled Kosilek could receive female hormones to help deal with anxiety and depression, but stopped short of allowing Kosilek to get a tax-payer funded sex-change operation.","Woman Spencer Cullen wanted to spend half the cash on a gender-swapping operation, police say .

"By . Martin Robinson . Last updated at 1:28 PM on 8th September 2011 . A defiant Colonel Gaddafi today denied he had fled Libya claiming he 'won't leave the land of his ancestors'. From his hiding place, the former leader told Syrian TV station Al Rai in an audio message he has not escaped to neighbouring Niger and maintains he is still in the country he led for 42 years. Despite the dramatic collapse of his rule he also said that his army is in place to wrestle the country back from the rebels. Defiant: Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi says he would 'never to leave the land of his ancestors' An image grab taken from the Syrian-based Arrai television shows a file picture of Gaddafi as he gives an audio message . In an angry outburst Gaddafi also blasted those who ousted him. 'All of these germs, rats and scumbags, . they are not Libyans, ask anyone. They have co-operated with Nato ... Gaddafi won't leave the land of his ancestors,' he said. 'We are ready to start the fight in Tripoli and everywhere else, and rise against them'. The five minute broadcast came amid conflicting statements and speculation about the 69-year-old'sÂ  whereabouts. He added: 'Our resolute Libyan people, the Libyan land is your own. Those who try to take it from you now, they are intruders, they are mercenaries, they are stray dogs. 'They are trying to seize our ancestral land from you but this is impossible. We will not leave our ancestral land. 'The youths are now ready to escalate the resistance against the 'rats' (transitional forces) in Tripoli and to finish off the mercenaries.' He tried to counteract what he portrayed as a propaganda war, telling his followers: 'They are trying to demoralize you.' The authenticity of the recording could not be verified but the voice and style strongly resembled Gaddafi, who has used the TV channel in the past. War: Libyan rebels chant anti-Gaddafi slogans and flash victory signs, near Bani Walid yesterday, south east of Tripoli, which is under siege by them . Battle: Anti-Gaddafi forces fire from tanks along the front line in Om El Khanfousa, east of Sirte yesterday, in one of the few pockets of fighting left . Gaddafi has not been seen in public for months. He went into hiding after opposition fighters swept into Tripoli on August 21 and has released only audio messages trying to rally his supporters and lash out at his opponents. Convoys of former regime loyalists, . including Gaddafi's security chief, fled across the Sahara into Niger . this week in a move that Libya's former rebels hoped could help lead to . the surrender of the last bastions of his support. It was rumoured that Gaddafi was among the convoy, but Niger has denied that the former Libyan leader had entered the country. It has led to the NTC to send envoys to neighbouring countries to ask them to deny him entry. 'We're asking every country not to accept him. We want these people for justice,' Fathi Baja, the NTC's head of political affairs said. He said Gaddafi might be close to the Niger or Algerian borders, waiting for an opportunity to slip across. 'He's looking for a chance to leave,' he added. The former rebels are still battling regime loyalists in three Gaddafi strongholds - Bani Walid, Sabha and Sirte. Fightback? Pro-Gaddafi forces fire on rebel fighters on the front line in Om El Khanfousa . The key battle has now seemingly moved to the town of Bani Walid, 90 miles south east of Tripoli, where Gaddafi is now believed to be staying. Fresh clashes broke out overnight and early today as Gaddafi loyalists fired at least 10 rockets along the desert front line at the town. It followed early morning skirmishes in the same area. Smoke billowed from where the projectiles landed in Wadi Dinar, about 12 miles outside the town, as the former rebels said the projectiles fired were Grad rockets. A rebel fighter removes a pro-Gaddafi poster with a dagger next to the last checkpoint before Bani Walid today . It has led to thousands of 'rebel' fighters converging on the area, who are threatening to attack if residents . do not surrender by Saturday. A convoy of NTC pickup trucks was reported to be heading towards the . town with dozens of fighters clutching rocket-propelled grenades and . shouting anti-Gaddafi slogans. 'We will move into Bani Walid slowly. There was a message in Bani Walid . from Gaddafi,' NTC unit commander Jamal Gourji . said. 'He was rallying his troops and calling on people to fight. He is hiding . in a hole in the ground, like Iraq,' he added, in reference to late . Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein who was captured nine . months after his regime was toppled in 2003. Yesterday . more truckloads of former rebels arrived outside Bani Walid, a dusty . city of 100,000 strung along the low ridges overlooking a dried up . desert river valley on the road connecting Gaddafi's hometown of Sirte . and Sabha to the south. 'That would explain why Bani Walid is resisting,' NTC negotiator Abdallah Kanshil said of reports of Gaddafi's presence in the town. 'His two sons are definitely there.' The Pentagon said it had no information to indicate the fallen leader had left his North African homeland. The U.S. said it had also contacted the governments of Niger, Mali, Mauritania, Chad and Burkina Faso - a swathe of poor former French colonies which benefited from Gaddafi's oil-fueled largesse in Africa. The State Department urged them to secure their borders and to detain and disarm Gaddafi officials. Gaddafi and his son, Saif al-Islam, are wanted for crimes against humanity by the International Criminal Court in The Hague. British Foreign Secretary William Hague said any country where he was found should hand him over to be tried, remarks that were echoed by the U.S. ambassador to Libya, Gene Cretz. Finding Gaddafi would help seal the new rulers' hold on the country, and likely trigger the collapse of the remaining regime loyalists still fighting the former rebels.","He claims that his loyalist army is still strong enough to seize back power from rebels .

A rare letter U.S. President Abraham Lincoln sent to one of his top generals at a turning point in the Civil War is expected to sell for $100,000. The handwritten note on presidential stationary was sent to Major General George B. McClellan on October 29, 1862. McClellan was removed  from his duties a week afterwards for failing to aggressively pursue Confederate General Robert E. Lee after the Battle of Antietam a month earlier.

"By . James Chapman, Political Editor . Last updated at 11:34 AM on 8th September 2011 . The 50p top rate of tax looks certain to be abolished for high earners by 2013, while tax breaks are to be accelerated for millions at the other end of the income scale. In tandem with a move to scrap the rate, Chancellor George Osborne is expected to speed up moves to raise the threshold at which income tax kicks in to Â£10,000. A senior Cabinet minister admitted yesterday the supertax is doing âmore harm than goodâ. Well-timed intervention? Eric Pickles said he backed calls to scrap the 50p tax rate on incomes over Â£150,000 as George Osborne faced more pressure to act . Communities Secretary Eric Pickles . spoke out after 20 of Britainâs leading economists called on Mr Osborne . to scrap the tax, introduced by Labour at the height of the financial . crisis. But Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls claimed a temporary cut in the VAT rate to cut prices at the checkout would be more likely to kick start the economy. In a joint letter yesterday, 20 . leading economists â including former Bank of England Monetary Policy . Committee members Dr DeAnne Julius and Dr Sushil Wadhwani â warned that . Britain now has one of the highest personal tax regimes in the . industrialised world. This makes it âless competitive . internationally, and making us less attractive as a destination for both . foreign investment and talented workersâ, they wrote. Mr Osborne describes the tax, levied . on income over Â£150,000, as a âtemporary measureâ. There is growing . speculation that in his Budget next spring he will announce the 50p rate . is to be scrapped the following year. But abolishing a levy which affects only the wealthiest 320,000 people in Britain will be fraught with political danger. Is it worth scrapping the 50p tax rate to boost the economy? The Chancellor has commissioned . research into whether the tax loses more revenue than it brings in by . driving wealth creators away and encouraging tax evasion. Mr Pickles . said: âThere is a strong case to say [the 50p tax rate] isnât actually . contributing very much and on balance is probably doing more damage than . good.â Lib Dem sources said their price for agreeing to abolish the tax would be an alternative tax on the wealthy. Business Secretary Vince Cable is . pushing to revive his idea of a âmansion taxâ on homes worth more than . either Â£1million or Â£2million. But Lib Dem colleagues say that is . unlikely to be approved by Mr Osborne and are working on proposals for . alternative taxes on the wealthy once the 50p rate is scrapped. âWe are . not ideologically wedded to the 50p tax rate, but when youâre saying . everyone must pay their share you do have to ensure that means . everyone,â said one. Keep 50p tax: Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls said the Government would be better off cutting the rate of VAT to boost economic growth . The 50p tax affects nearly 320,000 taxpayers â 1 . per cent of the total number of taxpayers. They contribute 24 per cent . of income tax raised by the Government, according to HMRC figures. Former Conservative Cabinet minister . John Redwood said scrapping the 50p rate would actually lead to an . increase in the overall tax take from high-earners. He added: âUnless we . get more money out of the rich we are not going to get the deficit . down.â Liberal Democrat peer Lord Oakeshott said cutting the 50p tax rate was âthe last thing we want to doâ. âIf you have any money for tax cuts, . you donât give it to the top one per cent of people, who tend to . actually save quite a lot of it. It should be given to those at the . bottom, to raise the tax-free allowance up to Â£10,000, because people in . that situation will go out and spend it in the shops.â Labourâs Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls told BBC Breakfast that the Government would be better off cutting VAT. 'If you really want to get spending and purchasing power into the economy quickly, rather than doing it through personal allowances, which tends to be a bit diffuse, better to have a temporary cut in VAT because a cut in VAT puts money into people's pockets straight away. It will have more of an impact upon the economy,' he said. 'But to be honest, if he was to do personal allowances rather than VAT it would be such a change of direction.' A Treasury spokesman said: âThe 50p . rate is a temporary measure. The Government is committed to a . competitive tax system, but in reducing the deficit, we have always been . clear those with the broadest shoulders should carry the greatest . burden.â Talks: Ana Botin accidentally showed off the paperwork as she left Downing Street .

"By . Martin Robinson . Last updated at 8:03 AM on 7th September 2011 . New secret files from the heart of Colonel Gaddafi's government have revealed the paranoid final few months of his violent and oppressive 42-year regime. The hundreds of intelligence documents left behind by his fleeing staff include a written pledge by one spy to poison rebel leaders' food and water to help him cling onto power. As the revolution grew against Gaddafi more and more secret files from his intelligence service flowed back to Tripoli. These phone tap records and . dispatches from domestic agents claim that al-Qaida was behind the . rebellion and that 4,000 U.S. troops were about to invade from Egypt. Gaddafi even drafted a letter of Barack Obama saying he should support Libya to stop terrorists taking over. Plots: This ransacked desk in Moammar Gaddafi's intelligence headquarters in Tripoli housed documents showing how the regime used all its means to try to quash the rebellion . They also said rebels carried Viagra and . condoms into battle so they could rape women and told Gaddafi and his . family to use their mobile phones for only three minutes at a time. Military leaders in the western mountains . were disregarding orders and troops in the city of Misrata ran out of . ammunition saying the situation had descended into 'every man for . himself,' reports also showed. One of the handwritten intelligence reports, written by a man who said he had 'infiltrated' the rebel council, gave the names of five members, their background and the hotels they frequented. The note concluded with an offer to kill the council members. 'I can carry out any suicide operation I'm given to assassinate members of the council or poison their food and water,' it says. The author is not identified and no council members have been killed by Gaddafi's regime. Deadly: One spy pledged to kill the rebel leadership by poisoning them, new documents show . The reports, going back to the start of the rebellion in February, grew more desperate as the Libyan rebellion veered into civil war. One document discovered was a draft letter from Gaddafi to President Barack Obama. 'It is necessary to support Libya to . get rid of the armed men of al-Qaida before all of north Africa falls . into the hands of bin Laden,' it said. It is unclear if the letter was . ever sent. The documents refer to the rebels as 'insurgents,' 'saboteurs' 'armed gangs' and 'rats.' Reports . from across Libya detail the government's actions to erase opposition . symbols, such as replacing rebel flags with the green banners of the . Gaddafi regime or painting over rebel graffiti. The reports also showed how the regime was quick to believe its own disinformation. In one conversation log, an Egyptian man said 4,000 U.S. troops were in Cairo, waiting to enter Libya by land. Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi received hundreds of security reports, many of which showed how his control of the country was collapsing . 'Four thousand, some of them commandos,' the Egyptian said. 'It's unbelievable.' There were signs of paranoia. In one log, a man with a Gulf Arab accent advised that Gaddafi, his sons and associates 'use their cellphone for no more than three minutes,' out of fear that they, too, were being intercepted. In April and May, bleak reports flowed back from the front lines. A May 5 report depicted chaos in the ranks, saying soldiers often ran out of ammunition before reaching the battlefield, leading many to be killed or captured. 'The rest fled randomly in all directions,' the report said, citing the 'lack of leaders for members of the armed forces on site (every man for himself).' Later reports suggested threats inside Tripoli from regime opponents and one contained two handwritten letters, threatening to kill security forces. 'We will take mercy on no one, regardless of his position, and will kill anyone manning a checkpoint,' one read. Next to a hand-drawn rebel flag, red ink declared, 'You have been warned.' At the centre of the situation was Gaddafi's intelligence chief Abdullah al-Senoussi, whose well-fortified compound received reports from around the country. One letter from the Investigation and Surveillance Office pleaded with al-Senoussi to intervene at a site which 'has become an office of alcohol, prostitution and theft of property of those arrested.' In the next four pages, the officer accused his boss of getting drunk on the job, stealing money from prisoners and seizing cars to give to his guards, sons and favorite prostitutes. Jubilation amongst rebel fighters today, but many were being tracked by Gaddafi's security forces files have shown . He said his superior drugged an Egyptian woman and tried to rape her before an aide intervened, and later 'sentenced' three of his officers to death. 'This order caused some confusion among those in the office,' he noted. A ragged band of mountain rebels now handles security at al-Senoussi's compound, parking their truck under the intelligence services' motto: 'The weapons are in the people's hands.' Inside, the fighters lounge in chairs and casually flip through the hundreds of documents strewn on the floor. Among them is an order from al-Senoussi that was not carried out before he fled. 'In the crucial last moments, get rid of the contents of the administration and its secret documents by burning or destroying them,' it said.","Unknown agent offered to target rebel leadership's food and water to help Gaddafi stay in power .

The grieving parents of a student stabbed to death by a teenage gang after he asked them to stop throwing conkers said such attacks would never happen in the family's native Colombia. Breaking down Andre Grisales said he did not understand why his son Steven was killed and said it would not have happened in the parts of South America where the family live and he works.

The teenager is in a serious but stable condition in hospital. Two people have been arrested. Mr Grisales described his 21-year-old son as a 'good boy' who had done nothing wrong before he was stabbed. The aspiring architect, who was born in Britain but whose parents are Colombian, was due to start a course this month as part of a Westminster College scholarship when he was killed on his way to Silver Street railway station in Edmonton, North London last week. He was on his way to go shopping for his grandmother when he was attacked. Steven had only returned to the UK three and a half weeks ago from Argentina. His father has been working there and the teenager was spending time with him. Mr Grisales said his son did not drink or smoke and was not into gangs. He said: 'It's devastating for all of us, the whole family - aunties, cousins, grandma, uncles - back home, it's been horrible because we don't get it. 'We don't understand. Without a reason, without nothing.' Devastated: Jasmid Grisales and her husband Andres visit the site where their son Steven was stabbed to death in North London .

Police were alerted to the attack at 6.50pm yesterday to reports of a stabbing in College Close. A Scotland Yard spokesman said: . 'Officers now believe the incident began after conkers were thrown at . the victim as he made his way towards Silver Street railway station. 'He initially remonstrated with the youths but one of the suspects produced a knife and stabbed him.' Police were called to the crime scene at College Close, Edmonton, just after 7pm following reports of the injured male. A local resident heard Mr Grisales' screams and ran outside to try and help.

"By . Louise Boyle . Last updated at 2:14 PM on 8th September 2011 . The unsolved murder of Kelso Cochrane has finally been laid to rest after 50 years after the man accused of killing him was named as Patrick Digby. Mr Cochrane, a black immigrant from Antigua, was stabbed to death by a white youth in Notting Hill, west London in 1959. Digby was arrested along with another men after police focused their inquiries on a group of white men at a house party in the street where the murder took place. Both men said they had left the party to fight with one another and Digby, a 20-year-old caterer in the Merchant Navy, was released. Patrick Digby (pictured left) has been named as the man who killed Kelso Cochrane in 1959 in a racial attack . BBC documentary maker, Mark Olden, claims in his new book, Murder In Notting Hill, claims that Digby had confessed to the killing to a group of friends. One of Digby's friends said: 'He told me he'd done it and they'd never get him.' Among the allegations that the book makes is a suggestion that the knife used to kill Mr Cochrane is still under the floorboards in the house where Digby lived at the time with his mother. Police never recovered the weapon which, it is alleged, is under the floorboards of his former home, according to the Daily Telegraph. The black community in Notting Hill say they have known who the killer is and that it was something of an 'open secret', but there are also allegations of institutional racism within the police who feared a violent backlash if a white man was sentenced to death over the murder of a black man. A few months before there had been violent scenes in the area and relationships between different groups of people in the area were still tense. A blue plaque marks the spot in Golborne Road where Mr Chochrane, an aspiring lawyer, was killed as he walked home from hospital. He had been injured while working as a lawyer and was close to his home. Mr Cochrane's funeral became a mass demonstration against racism in Notting Hill . Campaigners tried to highlight the case in Whitehall amid allegations of a police cover up . He was set upon close to his home in Notting Hill by white youths before being taken to hospital where he later died. More than 1,200 people attended his funeral. Cochraneâs murder was greeted with . outrage among the black community, some of whom marched down Whitehall . holding protest banners. Rab Butler, the then home secretary, made . an appeal in Parliament for witnesses to come forward, and set up a . public inquiry into race relations. Despite apparent fears that the . murder would stoke further tension, it is now seen as a turning point in . race relations in the area and is heralded as spurring on the creation of the Notting Hill . Carnival. His family has long sought justice for his death and his brother Stanley travelled from Antigua to speak to people close to him about the death. Stanley Cochrane called for a cold case review in 2003 but that was hampered by the destruction of his brother's clothes in 1968, destroying vital forensic evidence. Digby, who went on to become a painter and decorator, was not questioned during the review and died aged 69 in 2007 from a heart attack.","A new book claims the identity of the killer had been an 'open secret' since Kelso Cochrane's death .

"By . Emily Allen . Last updated at 7:28 PM on 8th September 2011 . Almost one in three households in some areas of the country have not one person in work, shocking figures revealed today. And in a reflection of the stagnant and fragile state of the economy the three areas with the highest rates of of joblessness are the same cities that topped the table last year. More than 30 per cent of households in Liverpool, Nottingham and Glasgow are classed as workless in 2010, said the Office for National Statistics. For Liverpool and Glasgow the figure fell in the previous year from 32.1 per cent and 31.1 per cent, to 31.9 per cent and 30.7 per cent. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Jobless Britain: Liverpool, Glasgow and Nottingham have recorded the highest level of . households where no-one is in work for the second year in a row . In Nottingham it increased from 31.3 per cent to 31.6 per cent. Liverpool has had the highest number of workless households in five of the past seven years, today's data showed. There were 3.9million workless households in the UK last year - a total of 5.4million people aged between 16 and 64. The ONS said being sick or disabled was the main reason for people nationally not being in work. Around a third of those not working in Liverpool and Glasgow gave this reason, the same as the national figure of 28 per cent. Liverpool, pictured, has had the highest number of workless households in five of the past seven years, today's data showed . â¢ Sick or disabled (28 per cent) â¢ Unemployed (19 per cent) â¢ Retired (19 per cent) â¢ Looking after the family or home (16 per cent) â¢ Study (12 per cent) â¢ Other (7 per cent) However, 43 per cent of people in workless households in Nottingham gave study as their main reason, compared with 12 per cent nationally. Some people in workless households are . not working because of early retirement. This figure was much higher in . the South West but low in London. The areas with the lowest number of households without work were Oxfordshire, Surrey, Aberdeen, and NE Moray, all around 11 per cent. The national average for workless households is currently 18.9 per cent according to the latest figures. A total of 1.84million children lived in the so-called workless households figures in June showed. Earlier this month new figures revealed more than a quarter of graduates do not have a full-time job three and a half years after leaving university. A staggering 115,000 youngsters who . graduated in 2007 have been consigned to the unemployment scrapheap, . lumbered with a dead-end part-time job or are still in education, . according to the Higher Education Statistics Agency (HESA).

Glasgow (30.7 per cent) 4. Wolverhampton (28.1 per cent) 5. Manchester (26.9 per cent) Despite today's figures, the overall number of workless households has fallen slightly in the past year. Employment minister Chris Grayling said in June: 'While the slight fall in the numbers of workless households and children living in workless households is encouraging, these figures still underline the sheer scale of the challenge we face. 'Over the last decade thousands of people were simply abandoned to a lifetime on benefits, and a staggering 1.84million children are living in homes where currently no one works. 'This is why we launched the Work Programme this summer which will give tailor-made support to help people get off benefits and get into work, while our overhaul of the benefits system will ensure that work is always the best option.'","Liverpool has highest number of workless households .

With an audience of rock stars, actors and assorted trendsetters, a fusty oration about fiscal prudence was clearly not going to suffice. Yet George Osborne still managed to raise more than a few eyebrows with a speech to mark his naming as Politician of the Year by the menâs fashion bible, GQ. The Chancellor took a leaf out of his foul-mouthed near-namesake Ozzie Osbourneâs book with a reference to the solitary practices of adolescent boys. Proud: George Osborne with his Politician of The Year award and journalist Nick Robinson. The Chancellor let slip a swear word during his acceptance speech . Mr Osborne, at 40 the youngest Chancellor for 120 years, started with a touch of self-deprecation as he faced the crowd at the Royal Opera House. âIâve just come from addressing about 300 bankers in the City of London and it says something about my profession that I was still the most unpopular person in the room,â he said. âIt is a fine recognition.â 'Thank you. I wonât reveal your secret past as chairman of the National Young Conservatives about twenty years ago. 'It is a pleasure to win this award. Iâve just come from addressing about 300 bankers in the City of London . and it says something about my profession that I was still the most . unpopular person in the room. 'It is a fine recognition. Of course, . we pay close attention to what Nick [Robinson] brilliantly reports on . the 10 oâclock news, and whatâs written in the pages of the Financial . Times. 'Iâm not sure who actually reads the . politics pages of GQ magazine though, Dylan â I suspect they are the . only pages of the magazine that a teenage boy hasnât stuck together in . reading the magazine. 'Some might say thatâs because the w****** are on the page rather than reading them. Thank you very much for the award.' In a reference to a fellow guest, BBC Political Editor Nick Robinson, he added: âOf course, we pay close attention to what Nick brilliantly reports on the 10 OâClock news, and whatâs written in the pages of the Financial Times. âIâm not sure who actually reads the politics pages of GQ magazine though. I suspect they are the only pages of the magazine that a teenage boy hasnât stuck together in reading the magazine. âSome might say thatâs because the w***ers are on the page rather than reading them.â His words provoked groans among the audience, which included U2, Kylie Minogue, Salman Rushdie and Charlize Theron. A clearly surprised Stephen Fry, who took to the stage next to hand a gong to his old friend Hugh Laurie, told the Chancellor: âWhat were you thinking? Are you aware the magazine has male models?Â Were you thinking of Maxim?â Mr Osborne left soon after winning the award. A colleague said: âThis was supposed to be an off-the-cuff and self-deprecating joke at the expense of politicians, and was certainly not meant to cause offence.â London Mayor Boris Johnson failed to raise the tone of the occasion when he went on to tell the audience how he was frequently described as aÂ  âTory t***erâ. Before handing the Man of Next Year award to Olympics supremo Lord Sebastian Coe, he said: âIâve been pounding the streets of Croydon, Iâve been hailed as I usually am with friendly shouts of, âYou Tory t***erâ. âI want you to know that I bring a message from Croydon, from all the businesses Iâve seen who are getting back on their feet, and that is that nothing and no one on earth is going to stop us preparing the greatest city on earth for the greatest Olympic Games that have ever been held.â Pint-sized pop stars: Kylie Minogue cosied up to Tinie Tempah after he won the Solo Artist of the Year award . Two years ago as leader of the Opposition, David Cameron was forced to apologise for using the slang word âtw*tâ on a radio show. In a reference to the social networking website Twitter, Mr Cameron had quipped: âThe trouble with Twitter, the instantness of it â too many twits might make a tw*t. He compounded the slip-up when he said people were âp***** off â sorry, I canât say that in the morning â angry with politiciansâ. While Mr Cameronâs aides pointed out that tw*t is not a swearword under radio guidelines and said he had apologised immediately for his latter comment, he later expressed contrition for his use of bad language. âYou always have to be careful what you say,â he said. âIf Iâve caused any offence I obviously regret that.â",Tory picked up an award for Politician of the Year .
"By . Emily Allen . Last updated at 6:33 PM on 7th September 2011 . Anthony Lloyd, 17, was found by police with his pockets 'bulging' with stolen cigarettes and jewellery . A teenage looter who took part in the Manchester riots lied in court about being an Olympic hopeful in a bid to avoid jail. Anthony Lloyd, 17, who was caught with pockets bulging with jewellery and cigarettes during the riots in Manchester on August 9, was jailed for eight months yesterday. But now he could now be hauled back into the dock after falsely claiming he was a member of the British judo team in a desperate plea for leniency. A letter was even presented to the judge at Manchester Magistrates Court backing up the claim. Lloyd had managed to convince his unwitting legal team he was a promising judo star. His defence lawyer Estelle Parkhouse told the court: 'A custodial sentence would impair his prospects with the squad and being part of the Olympics.' But it has been discovered Lloyd has never performed for Great Britain at any level. Bosses at the British Judo Association said that while he is a member of a local club he is 'a million miles away' from being anywhere near the national squad. A spokesman said: 'Mr Lloyd has never represented us at any level and it's wrong for anyone to describe him as an Olympic hopeful. 'He represents a club but has never been in any GB trials or anywhere near any of our squads.' It is understood the case could now be re-opened if the court feels it has been misled.Â  Lloyd may now face further charges of perjury should judges decide to bring him back into the dock. Loyd was sentenced to eight months' detention and training for each count, to serve concurrently at Manchester Youth Court . He could also be hauled before Crown Court if the offence is considered serious enough. Lloyd, of Audenshaw, was stopped by police at 9.30pm at the height of the rioting in Manchester. Officers found him carrying Â£66 worth of cigarettes stolen from a looted newsagents and a collection of costume jewellery which he said he had picked up off the floor. During the case Lloyd's lawyer Estelle Parkhouse said Lloyd was part of the British Judo team . and was returning from training that Tuesday night when he heard about . the disorder and ventured into the city centre. She said he took jewellery that he had seen on the street and knew it had been stolen. She said it was his intention to give it to his girlfriend. Lloyd's parents and brother were in court to hear District Judge Jonathan Taaffe describe the case as 'most tragic'. The judge said he accepted Lloyd had led a 'blameless existence' and had 'an excellent future and was a talented sportsman'. But after reading glowing references the judge told him: 'It is my duty to impose a custodial sentence in this matter. 'The public have to be aware that people who choose to become involved in large scale public disorder, rioting and looting, will be severely punished. 'On this night the centre of Manchester and Salford resembled a battlefield and the public throughout the country were shocked and sickened by what they saw.' Lloyd, who burst into tears as the sentence was read out, said he had been stupid and had gone into the city out of curiosity. After the hearing Ms Parkhouse issued a statement on his behalf, saying: 'I am sincerely remorseful for my actions and would do anything to give back to the community what I have taken from them.' It is understood attempts to check the bogus claim were made by the defence team. But they were unable to contact the GB team as they were in action abroad. Lloyd's social worker father declined to comment.",British Judo Association admit he was a member of a local club but 'a million miles' from the national squad .
"By . Emily Andrews and James Tozer . Last updated at 11:31 PM on 6th September 2011 . The police chief whose force is investigating the hospital insulin poisonings has likened the probe to the Agatha Christie mystery 'Murder on the Orient Express' â but on a massive scale. In the much-loved whodunit, Hercule Poirot had to contend with 12 suspects, any of whom could have carried out a brutal killing on the iconic train. But following the dramatic release of the sole suspect, nurse Rebecca Leighton, detectives are having to examine a bewildering 700 people who could have contaminated saline fluids at Stepping Hill Hospital in Stockport. Free: Charges against Rebecca Leighton, 27, pictured for the first time yesterday, were dropped on Friday . Peter Fahy, Chief Constable of Greater Manchester Police, said the challenge facing officers was not only to prove that one of them was responsible for the poisoning, but also to conclusively eliminate all the others. âWe have a situation where 700 people may have had access to the crime scene and yet we have to show that no one else could be involved,â he told the BBC. âIt is like Murder on the Orient Express but with a lot more people on the train. âThe situation is almost unique. Normally in a murder in a house or a pub you can quickly establish who was at the scene. This will take many months.â Rebecca Leighton, pictured, now plans to sue . police for a six-figure sum, claiming wrongful arrest, or trying to gain . compensation worth up to Â£1million . Innocent: Miss Leighton and her fiancÃ© Tim Papworth yesterday . Challenge: Peter Fahy says hundreds must be eliminated from probe . Mr Fahy admitted that the fact that . the ward at the centre of the investigation had remained open throughout . further complicated police inquiries. âWe . did discuss shutting one ward with the hospital, but it was decided . that moving people out of a ward could pose a risk to their welfare,â he . said. And he confirmed . fears that the number of agency staff â some from abroad â passing . through the hospital over the period at the centre of the inquiry . represented a further hurdle. âIt is a very complex investigation, 700 people had access to a crime scene that was never shut. âAnd . the transient nature of some hospital staff - who may have moved on - . is another difficulty we have to face - tracking them down. âOur nightmare was that we could have another death. Nothing has happened since we got involved.' Miss . Leighton, 27, spent more than six weeks in custody after the deaths of . five elderly patients were linked to suspected saline drip poisoning. She was released last Friday when all charges against her were dropped due to lack of evidence. Her . lawyer said she had been made a scapegoat by police who felt under . pressure to end the âchaosâ surrounding the case and that she now wanted . to overturn her suspension and return to nursing. Mr . Fahy admitted his officers had been under pressure, but he insisted the . decision to charge her hadnât been rushed by police or the Crown . Prosecution Service (CPS). Deaths: From left, Tracey Arden, 44, George Keep, 84, and Arnold Lancaster, 71, who died at Stepping Hill Hospital in Stockport . Security: Guards at the entrance to Stepping Hill Hospital, Stockport . âIt . is common sense that officers were under pressure to make sure there . was not another occurrence of contamination at the hospital,â he said. âThat did not translate into a decision to charge. âThe CPS set high standards. The evidence was assessed by the CPS who still decided to charge.â Mr Fahy also controversially backed a call from leading barrister John Cooper QC for crime suspects to be given anonymity. Wrongly accused: Chris Jefferies was arrested after the death of his tenant Joanna Yeates . He . used as an example the case of Christopher Jefferies, the landlord who . was arrested for the murder of Joanna Yates in Bristol and later freed . without being charged. âIt is really difficult when you see senior detectives agonising over whether to make an arrest or not. âRealising . that this is what's going to happen, that there's going to be a media . furore and this person's reputation is going to be completely ruined. âI . don't want to comment about this particular case, but in general there . was the case in Bristol where the landlord got horribly portrayed in the . media and eventually was found completely innocent. âSo I totally support what the QC has said I think there should be a ban on people certainly until they've been charged.â Fans . of Agatha Christieâs well-loved crime novel will know that Poirot . establishes the unlikely solution to the mystery facing him - that all . 12 suspects took part in the 'Murder on the Orient Express'. Police . in Stockport are continuing to probe the deaths of Tracey Arden, 44, . Arnold Lancaster, 71, and Derek Weaver, 83, and the deaths of a further . four unnamed victims.

"By . Jessica Satherley . Last updated at 8:31 PM on 7th September 2011 . Aspirations: Steven Grisales, who wanted to study architecture, was stabbed to death in Edmonton . An aspiring architect was stabbed to death by a teenage gang after he asked them to stop throwing conkers at him. Steven Grisales, 21, was due to start a course this month as part of a Westminster College scholarship. He was walking to a station in Edmonton, north London, when he was attacked. Youths threw conkers at Mr Grisales and when he stood up to them, one produced a knife. He was stabbed in the chest in the attack on Wednesday evening and died the following day. Steven had moved from London to Argentina to live with his father, but came back to London in July this year to start the three-year architecture course. A 15-year-old boy has been charged with the murder and has appeared in court, while another boy, also 15, has been questioned. A 19-year-old man and a 16-year-old girl have already been arrested and released on bail. Speaking from the scene, Steven's mother Jasmid wept as her husband Andres told of their heartbreak. Mr Grisales said his son was a 'great boy' whose brothers and sisters were 'devastated' by his death. The couple appeared near the murder scene in College Close to pay tribute to their eldest child and appeal for witnesses to come forward. Mr Grisales, who was in Argentina on business when his son was killed, said Steven had been visiting his grandmother and shopping for her before he was attacked. He added: 'It is devastating for all of us, the whole family, aunties, cousins, grandma, uncles, back home, it's been horrible because we don't get it.' Hazel Nelson Williams leaves a floral tribute at the site where Steven Grisales was stabbed . A Scotland Yard spokesman said: . 'Officers now believe the incident began after conkers were thrown at . the victim as he made his way towards Silver Street railway station. 'He initially remonstrated with the youths but one of the suspects produced a knife and stabbed him.' Police were called to the crime scene at College Close, Edmonton, just after 7pm following reports of the injured male. A local resident heard Mr Grisales' screams and ran outside to try and help. Mary Stokes, 27, told the Enfield Independent: 'I was in the house and heard shouting, as I walked out he was holding his chest. 'I . tried to speak to him but he wasn't saying much. We tried to help him . but there was not much we could do, he had been stabbed in the heart.' Smile like sunshine: A message attached to a floral tribute left by a wellwisher today .

"By . Nick Pisa and Oliver Pickup . Last updated at 9:36 AM on 7th September 2011 . Italy ground to a halt today as a general strike brought thousands - if not millions - on to the street in protest at a belt-tightening â¬45billion (Â£39.5bn) austerity package. The strike was organised by the Italian General Confederation of Labour (CGIL), the country's biggest trade union, and saw disruption to flights, buses, trains as well as hospitals, schools, post offices and other government services. Demonstrations were held in several cities across the country with extra police being drafted in to stop any potential disorder but there were still sporadic outbursts with eight officers hurt by fireworks. Thousands of strikers took to the streets of Turin yesterday to protest against the austerity plans mooted by the Italian government . Workers march in front of the Colosseum as they take part in a demonstration organised by the left-wing General Confederation of Italian Workers (CGIL) against the government's economic austerity measures, in central Rome . The general-secretary of the CGIL, Susanna Camusso, addresses protesters at the Colosseum in Rome . CIGL officials said that three million people had taken part in the strike - which also affected the Amanda Knox appeal trial in Perugia as jury members using public transport were held up. The strike was supported by British trade union Unison chief Dave Prentis who sent a letter backing the action, expressing the 'solidarity' of his members with 'Italian workers'. Mr Prentis added that politicians across Europe were in a 'vicious circle that was increasing as opposed to reducing public debt because of austerity cuts. Under-pressure: Prime minister Silvio Berlusconi, shown speaking last month, is widely unpopular in Italy now - and his austerity plans are hated . 'What we and European trade unions are proposing as a way out of the crisis is growth - that's why we wish the best of luck to our colleagues in CGIL in their fight.' Italy, the third largest economy in the Eurozone, is teetering on the edge of a Greek-style financial crisis with a debt approaching Â£1trillion - 120 per cent of GDP. The under-pressure prime minister, Silvio Berlusconi, has insisted the best way to tackle the crisis is with the tough austerity package which will see cuts in education, health and pay freezes. But the proposed package has also been hit by backstabbing from within his coalition as supposed allies protest at some of the cuts and to appease them they are scrapped. Initially there had been plans to move three national bank holidays to Sundays to keep productivity going but this was dropped following a national outcry. Susanna Camusso, head of CGIL, said: 'When you are on the edge of the abyss, you have to take a step backwards. 'This is a general strike against a budget measure which is totally unjustified and as we have seen in the past few hours totally irresponsible.' Protesters who gathered in central Rome unfurled a banner that said: 'Change the austerity package to give a future to the country - more growth, more employment, more development.' One of the most affected areas was Rome airport which saw hundreds of flights cancelled and long queues at airline information desks as passengers tried to find out how to get away. Millions of Italians are holding a day-long strike against the government's latest austerity measures . Workers march and hold flags during a demonstration organised by the CGIL against the government's economic austerity measures .

Ryanair said that 200 of its flights were cancelled across the country as a result of the strike with pilots and crew joining the walkout as well as ground staff and some air traffic controllers. Trains and buses were also hit and traffic, which is chaotic at the best of times in Italy, was made even worse as people used cars to get to work or take children to school. Production was also affected at Fiat plants across the country with 25 per cent of the workforce taking part and newspapers were also hit with presses stopping printing. Italian markets which have suffered huge losses over the last few days were also significantly down as well with the Milan stock exchange showing a drop of more than 2 per cent. Tonight extra police were also drafted in to protect the Italian Senate where the package was to be debated after paint and smoke bombs were hurled by marchers.","Eight police officers hurt by fireworks .

Ahmed Abdulkadir . Warsame appeared in a New York court on Tuesday morning and pleaded not . guilty to providing material support to al Qaeda in the Arabian . Peninsula and the Somali group Al Shabaab. It is thought that the revelation that Warsame was kept aboard the ship may cause problems for prosecutors. Fight: Islamist fighters loyal to Somalia's Al-Qaida inspired al-Shebab group perform military drills. Defendant Ahmed Abdulkadir Warsame is accused of working with the group . When Warsame was arrested in April by the U.S. military in the Gulf, he was questioned about anti-terrorism 'for intelligence purposes for more than two months' before being read his Miranda rights, the prosecutors said in a statement. Miranda rights entitle suspects to a lawyer and the right to remain silent. He was questioned by interrogators from the High-Value Detainee Interrogation Group and the U.S. military, according to an administration official. President Barack Obama's administration has come under fire by Republicans and even some fellow Democrats over his decision to prosecute some terrorism suspects in criminal courts and not in military courts, where rules for evidence are looser. In Washington, another senior administration official said Obama's national security team had unanimously recommended the prosecution of Warsame in a criminal court. A defense attorney for Warsame, Priya Chaudhry, did not respond to a request for comment. After his interrogation, a fresh FBI team came in and was permitted to talk with him, at which time he waived his legal rights and continued to talk for several days, said the first official, who declined to be identified because he was not authorized to talk on the record about matters of terrorism. Case: Mr Warsame's trial may come unstuck after it emerged he had been kept on a U.S. navy ship for two months prior to his civilian trial . Warsame arrived in New York City late on July 4 after being formally arrested the previous day, according to a letter from prosecutors to the U.S. court. Warsame, said to be in his mid-20s, was indicted on nine charges, including providing material support from at least 2007 to April 2011 to Somali militants al Shabaab and al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), two groups designated by Washington as terrorist organizations. According to the charges, Warsame also worked to broker a weapons deal with AQAP on behalf of al Shabaab. According to The New York Times after Mr. Warsame was given a break from interrogations after the two month delay. He waived his rights to a lawyer and according to the paper continued to co-operate with investigators. A joint statement by the Manhattan U.S. Attorney, the FBI and the New York Police Department said he was also charged with 'conspiring to teach and demonstrate the making of explosives, possessing firearms and explosives in furtherance of crimes of violence and other violations.'",Confinement contradicts Obama doctrine on 'Gitmo' inmates .
"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 12:51 PM on 2nd September 2011 . A newly-discovered species of woolly rhino that lived in Tibet more than 3.6million years ago could rewrite theories about the evolution of giant Ice Age mammals. Scientists suspect that the creature led the way in adapting to the harsh Tibetan climate, which in turn may have helped the animal's descendants survive the big freeze to come. The same could also be true for ancestors of other Ice Age 'megafauna' such as the woolly mammoth, giant sloth and sabre-toothed cat, the experts believe. Fashionable coat: The newly discovered species of Tibetan woolly rhino could have been a trend-setter, helping its ancestors to survive the Ice Age . The research suggests that the Tibetan plateau may have been an 'evolutionary cradle' for Ice Age giants. Much has been written about the extinction of Ice Age mammals, but much less is known about their origins. The new research focused on the complete skull and lower jaw of a new species of woolly rhino, Coelodonta thibetana, discovered in the foothills of the Himalayas at a site called the Zanda Basin. One special feature of the animal was a flattened horn, which it is thought was used as a snow shovel to reveal edible vegetation. At the time the rhino was coping with the Himalayan cold, most of the world was warm. The northern continents were free of the massive ice sheets that advanced across much of the globe during the Pleistocene era. When the Ice Age finally arrived, around 2.6million years ago, the rhinos are believed to have descended from their high-altitude home and expanded throughout northern Asia and Europe. Population explosion: The woolly rhino lived in the frozen Himalayas prior to the Ice Age and, when the big freeze struck, descended and spread quickly . Early influences: The same evolutionary process that helped Coelodonta thibetana thrive, did the same for the woolly mammoth and sabre-toothed cats . The U.S. research, published in the journal Science, speculates that the Arctic and Antarctic could have been other 'springboards' for Ice Age evolution. Lead author Dr Xiaoming Wang, from the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles, said: 'Cold places, such as Tibet, Arctic, and Antarctic, are where the most unexpected discoveries will be made in the future - these are the remaining frontiers that are still largely unexplored.' As well as the new woolly rhino, the team also found fossil remains of extinct species of three-toed horse, Tibetan bharal or 'blue sheep', chiru or Tibetan antelope, snow leopard, badger, and 23 other kinds of mammals. Commenting on the findings, Dr Richard Lane, from the U.S. National Science Foundation, said: 'This discovery clarifies the origin of the woolly rhinoceros - and perhaps much of the now extinct, cold-adapted, Pleistocene Eurasian megafauna - as the high-altitude environments of the Zanda Basin of the primordial Pliocene Himalayas.'",Newly-discovered species descended to plains from Himalayas when Ice Age struck .
"By . Amanda Platell . Last updated at 12:40 PM on 9th July 2011 . He's ONE of our greatest stars, a Golden Globe and Bafta winner whose movies have made millions worldwide. When he appeared as the adorably self-deprecating lead in Four Weddings And A Funeral 17 years ago, Britain fell in love with him. With subsequent hits such as Notting Hill and Bridget Jones under his belt, you would have thought Hugh Grant might be enjoying the laurels of success and have found contentment now he's 50. Clearly he hasn't. This week, as he toured TV stations fulminating self-righteously over the phone-hacking scandal, he came across as someone who is utterly embittered and jaundiced with life. Seen here on Question Time, Hugh Grant has toured TV stations fulminating self-righteously over the phone-hacking scandal . Of course, we are all appalled by the News of the World's illegal activities, particularly the sickening evidence that the newspaper tampered with Milly Dowler's mobile after she had disappeared. But the relish with which Grant is dancing on the grave of a newspaper with a 168-year history, which despite its smut can be proud of many fine and important investigations into corruption, doesn't do him justice. The death of any paper diminishes our democracy, but then have you noticed that the most vociferous critics of the British Press are invariably those whose rackety private lives have been exposed by it? Step forward that buffoon John Prescott, whose long and lurid affair with his secretary Tracey Temple abused the high office he held. And, inevitably, the former chief of the world's motor-racing federation, Max Mosley, who's best known for indulging in spanking and sex sessions with prostitutes dressed in German uniforms. How gleefully they now denounce the newspaper that exposed them. Meanwhile, Tony Blair's lying former communications chief, Alastair Campbell, who sexed up the case for the disastrous war in Iraq, has been just as vociferous. But what's really puzzling is the hatred Mr Grant feels for the popular Press, which arguably gave him the publicity over the years and created the fanbase that enabled him to earn such vast sums. Is it possible that his antipathy goes back to the revelations of that night in 1995 when LA police found him receiving oral sex from hooker Divine Brown? I hope not. Mr Grant should be above that.

Home Secretary Theresa May plans a change to the law to stop criminals using their 'right to a family life' under the Human Rights Act to prevent them being deported. One Bolivian used the fact he owns a British cat as part of his successful case that he should be allowed to stay here.

"President Saleh makes TV speech from Saudi Arabia . He's had eight operations since the June 3 attack . Protest leader says Saleh's career is over . By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 1:44 PM on 8th July 2011 . Yemen's embattled president, looking weakened and stiff, has made his first public appearance since he was injured in a blast on his palace compound last month, in an apparent bid to dispel growing speculation about his condition. President Ali Abdullah Saleh, who is undergoing treatment in Saudi Arabia, lashed out at opponents seeking to oust him from power, but his dramatically changed appearance belied his show of defiance. White plaster casts covered his arms and hands, and his face appeared noticeably darker and thinner than before the attack. He sported a short beard and his hair was covered with a red-and-white-checkered Arab headdress cloth, both unusual for the clean-shaven, suit-wearing leader. Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh gave a speech from the Saudi capital Riyadh on July 7 looking weak and thin . Attack: President Saleh used his speech to lash out at opponents . In a pre-recorded video statement broadcast on Thursday, Saleh said he'd undergone more than eight âsuccessful operations,â but did not say if and when he would return to Yemen. The leader of Yemen's ruling party, who is close to Saleh, said the president's brief speech helped set the record straight. âHis mere appearance on TV has clarified things for people and silenced many tongues by showing that the president is in good health,â said the politician, Yasser Yemani. However, Mohammed al-Thahiri, a protest leader in the Yemeni capital of Sanaa, said Saleh's career is over. âIt's clear form the way that he looks that he can't come back. This man is no longer able to rule the country,â said al-Thahiri. Wearing a white robe and sitting rigidly in an armchair, Saleh accused âterrorist elementsâ of carrying out the June 3 attack. He said dialogue is the only way out of the political crisis that has brought this impoverished corner of the Arabian Peninsula to the brink of civil war. Rejoicing: Yemeni men shout slogans celebrating the television appearance of President Saleh . âWhere are the conscious people? Where are the honest people? Where are the believers and the men who fear Allah? Why don't they stand with dialogue?â he said. âThey should stand with dialogue so we can find solutions.â âMany have understood democracy incorrectly, through incorrect practices,â Saleh said in the seven-minute video recorded in Saudi Arabia and broadcast on Yemen state TV. He accused his opponents of practicing the politics of âhijackingâ and âarm-twistingâ while describing himself as a defender of democracy and stability. âWe love participation, though the constitution, though the law,â he said.Saleh did not mention the U.S.-backed proposal by Yemen's powerful Gulf Arab neighbors that would see him transfer power in exchange for immunity from prosecution. Gathering: President Saleh's speech, in which he described himself as a defender of democracy, rallied his supporters . Before his injury, Saleh repeatedly refused to sign the proposal. More than four months of popular uprising seeking to end his rule have battered Yemen's economy, spread instability and caused the United States to turn away from Saleh, once considered a key ally in fighting Yemen's active al-Qaida branch. Many worry al-Qaida could exploit instability in Yemen to expand its operations. Illustrating the threat, security officials said Thursday that Islamist fighters killed 10 Yemeni soldiers execution-style after stopping their bus at a fake checkpoint. Wednesday's attack was carried out in the southern province of Abyan, where militants have already seized control of two towns. In the capital Sanaa, the crackle of gunfire rang out when Saleh appeared on TV, as security forces and Saleh supporters fired in the air. Sanaa protest leader Abdel-Hadi al-Azazi said a small explosion went off in the public square where protesters have camped out injured six people. Its cause remained unclear. Syria today said that the U.S. ambassador's unauthorised trip to the flashpoint city of Hama proves Washington has a hand in the troubles. The strong statement comes as Syrians are expected to take to the streets across the country in a weekly show of defiance against President Bashar Assad's autocratic regime. Hama, the site of a 1982 massacre by Assad's later father and predecessor, has become a focal point of the uprising and has drawn the largest crowds since the revolt began in mid-March. Backlash: A man wearing sunglasses painted with the colours of the Syrian national flag gives a v-sign during a rally in support of the Syrian opposition in Amman, Jordan . âThe presence of the U.S. ambassador in Hama without obtaining prior permission from the Foreign Ministry as stipulated by instructions distributed repeatedly to all the embassies is clear evidence of the U.S. involvement in the ongoing events in Syria,â the state-run news agency SANA reported Friday, citing an unnamed âofficial sourceâ at the Foreign Ministry. Thousands of Egyptians took to the streets around the country today to demand justice for victims of Hosni Mubarak's regime and press the new, military rulers for a clear plan of transition to democracy. There is growing frustration among Egyptians that little has changed five months after the 18-day uprising forced the former president to step down on February 11. Riots and protests have been escalating over what many see as the reluctance of the military rulers, who took over after Mubarak, to prosecute police and former regime officials for the killing of nearly 900 protesters during the uprising. The U.S. is trying to âaggravate the situations, which destabilise Syria,â the statement said. The central Syrian city poses a potential dilemma for Assad's government on Friday. A major offensive could make the city a fresh rallying cry for the opposition, but the regime also does not want a repeat of last Friday's stunning rally, when an estimated 300,000 people protested. Ambassador Robert Ford traveled independently Thursday to Hama to show solidarity with residents protesting against Assad's regime, according to the State Department. He also participated in a government-organised excursion to northern Syria last month. State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said Ford âspent the day expressing our deep support for the right of the Syrian people to assemble peacefully and to express themselves.â Ford reached the city after passing checkpoints run by the military and Hama residents. Nuland said he met nervous residents and saw many shops closed. He also visited a hospital treating the wounded.","President Saleh makes TV speech from Saudi Arabia .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 5:03 PM on 8th July 2011 . The father of a British teacher who was raped and murdered in Japan has pleaded to the judge in her killer's trial to pas the maximum sentence available. Linsay Hawker, 22, died trying to escape her captor after an horrific 17-hour ordeal during which she was raped, battered and choked to death. Her father Bill Hawker, who was called as a witness at Tokyo's Chiba District Court, appealed directly to the judge during the trial. 'Show him no mercy': Lindsay Hawker's family - Mother Julia, father Bill and sister Lisa Hawker - leave the Tokyo courthouse . He told the court how proud the family had been of her going to Japan to teach English and said her killer Tatsuya Ichihashi should be shown 'no mercy' as he had shown none for his daughter. Ichihashi, 32, has pleaded guilty to charges of rape, unlawfully disposing of a body and causing injury resulting in death which carry a sentence of between three and twenty years. But he denies denies murder, a crime which carries the death penalty in the country. Miss Hawker, from Brandon, Warwickshire, was found dead in a bath filled with sand at Tatsuya Ichihashi's flat, east of Tokyo, in March 2007 . Ichihashi wept as he described to the court how he had tied Ms Hawker's hands and feet with plastic loops and raped her in the hallway. While the prosecution maintains he had then strangled her, he claims he spent several hours talking to his victim in a bizzare attempt to make up for his actions. Raped and murdered:Miss Hawker was an English teacher and had educated the accused man, Tatsuya Ichihashi . He told the court: 'I was trying to make up for it and create some kind of relationship with her so that she would eventually forgtive me.' His defence team claims he had tried to revive Miss Hawker and that he had strangled her to prevent her crying out for help and should face a lesser charge of inflicting injury, causing death. On trial: Tatsuya Ichihashi pictured shortly after his 2009 arrest . He said: 'I gradually became frustrated with her, because I thought she wanted to use any means to escape. 'I punched her in the face twice ... I thought that I'd done something really terrible again. But I thought that I can't let her go now as I've punched her as well as raped her. 'But somehow I wanted her to forgive me.' He told the court he had woken up at 3am to discover that Ms Hawker had managed to free her wrists. He added: 'She was screaming. She was trying to escape. 'I was trying to cover her mouth with my left hand because I thought she might disturb the neighbours.' Under the Japanese legal system the Hawkers are classed as 'victim participants' and will be able, at the discretion of the court, to question the defendant and give their opinion on sentencing. They will also be able, for example, to ask to examine the prosecution evidence. In January Ichihashi promised to donate the proceeds of a book in which he confessed to the killing to Miss Hawker's family. It detailed how he spent two and a half years on the run following the murder and how he used false identities and underwent plastic surgery to change his appearance. Face change:Tatsuya Ichihashi spent two and a half years on the run following Miss Hawker's murder and underwent plastic surgery to evade capture. He is pictured here before, left, and after the operations . Ichihashi has also apologised to Miss Hawker's family, claiming he wrote the book as 'a gesture of contrition for the crime I committed'. He doesn't describe the crime or his motives in the book, titled Until the Arrest, instead detailing his life at large, during which he traveled up and down the country, in constant fear of arrest and obsessed with cosmetic surgery. Memory: Hawker's father Bill holds a photo of his daughter Lindsay outside the court in Chiba, Japan . It tells how he scissored off his lower lip, dug two moles out of his cheek with a box cutter and even gave himself a nose job in an attempt to obscure his identity. He also claimed to have embarked on a pilgrimage tour of temples on the south-western island of Shikoku, wishing Miss Hawker could 'come back to life'. He was finally arrested in Osaka while waiting for a ferry to Okinawa. The Japanese court, in Chiba, will work in much the same way as the English system, Kenichi Kinukawa, the lawyer representing the family, said. On the first day of the trial the defendant heard the charges and gave his plea to the allegations. The major differences with the UK courts are the victim participation system and the saiban-in (lay judge) jury system. The lay judge system sees members of the public selected to participate in the most serious trials, working together with professional judges to determine guilt or innocence and sentence. The verdict in the case is expected to be given on July 21. The trial continues.","Lindsay Hawker's family in Tokyo to attend murder trial .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 6:28 PM on 9th July 2011 . Murder and attempted murder charges: Police booking photo of Everett Conant . The wife of the man charged with killing his three sons and his brother ran from their mobile home screaming 'He killed my babies.' Suzette Ann Conant's desperate cries were witnessed by a neighbour in Wheatland, Wyoming. Everett E. Conant III surrendered without incident and was charged with first-degree murder, attempted first-degree murder, battery and a weapons violation. The murder and attempted-murder charges carry sentences of death or life without parole. Police found the bodies of the three boys and the brother inside the trailer home Thursday in Wheatland, about 70 miles north of Cheyenne. Suzette Conant was shot twice but was listed in good condition at a Cheyenne hospital. 'She kept screaming at me that her babies were dead. ""He killed my babies!""' said Jessica Kornder, who lives in the same mobile home park, told the Associated Press. 'I was in the kitchen doing some dishes after supper and I heard these two ""pows,"" and I thought it was fireworks. 'And then I heard this awful screaming.' Conant, whom police say was born in 1975, was ordered held without bail. His court-appointed lawyer, Eric Palen, declined to comment. Suzette Conant was shot in the ankle and shoulder, said Wheatland Police Chief Randy Chesser. Heading to jail The alleged killer is escorted into Platte County jail in the small farming town of Wheatland, Wyoming on Friday . His brother, Nacuma Roland Conant, 33, was taken to a Wheatland hospital where he was pronounced dead, Mr Chesser said. Authorities have yet to release the names of the other victims. But a judge referred to one of the sons as Joseph. A court document referred to the others as 'C.C.' and 'E.C.' Their dates of birth weren't released, but the document indicates Joseph was 11 or 12, C.C. was 12 or 13 and E.C. was 17 or 18. Mr Chesser said a motive for the shootings wasn't immediately known. He also said he didn't know if the boys were Conant's biological children. Conant was shackled at the wrists and ankles during the court hearing. He whispered 'yes' and 'no' to the judge's questions. Wheatland police Officer Doug Wiggins wrote in a court document that he was responding to a report of a shooting at the home. Conant yelled at him from the doorway and had something black in his hand, Wiggins said, adding that he saw what appeared to be the lifeless body of a male child on a couch. Accused: Police believe Everett Conant, pictured on a bike on his Facebook profile, shot dead his three sons and his brother before turning the gun on his wife, who survived . The officer said he spoke with Conant for about ten minutes before he persuaded him to leave the house without a weapon. He was arrested without further incident. As police officers wrapped up the crime scene, Mr Chesser said at least one handgun, possibly more, was used in the shootings. Mr Chesser said 'a lot' of rounds were fired. Conant worked briefly at the Wyoming Premium Farms hog farm just north of Wheatland this spring but quit after mentioning problems arranging child care, said Doug Derouchey, the general manager. 'Kind of kept to himself,' Mr Derouchey said. 'He just mentioned something about he was having difficulties kind of working it out time-wise.' 'He was, I think, having problems elsewhere,' Mr Derouchey added. Slaughter house: Investigators sift through evidence at the Conants home in Wheatland, Wyoming where the shootings took place . Suzette Conant works at an A&W restaurant in Wheatland, said co-worker Beth Horsley. 'She is the nicest person in the world. She didn't do anything to anybody,' Miss Horsley said. A collection jar was set up at the A&W for donations for Suzette Conant's medical care and the family's funeral costs. 'It's just a very tragic thing,' said Jean Dixon, mayor of this agricultural town of 3,600 people. 'It's hard to comment on something that just never occurs around here. 'It's like, ""How can it happen?"" This is a small community. We all know each other.' Wyoming, with about 560,000 residents, averages just under 11 murders a year, state officials said.","Wife survives after getting shot in ankle and shoulder .

"By . Rachel Quigley . Last updated at 6:52 PM on 10th July 2011 . Theirs is more than just your average boy-meets-girl story. It's a New York love story, with a very modern twist. Allen Sheinman, 58, and his wife Collette Stallone, 56, said they know the secret to a happy and successful marriage - live in separate homes. For the first four years of wedded bliss the quirky couple - who met online - lived apart, she in Greenwich Village and he in West 23rd street in Manhattan. Secret: Collette Stallone said she believes marriage is a state of mind and doesn't see why two people have to live together . Force: Allen Sheinman said he didn't want to both get married and lived together but the recession drove them to cohabit . Allen - a managing editor at a trade publication - said: 'We consider seventh avenue a long hallway between our two domiciles.' But hard times hit as it did with many New Yorkers and when Allen's boss raised his rent to $1,800 a month, the couple did the unthinkable - they moved in together. Allen said: 'It was really a financial move to cohabit. Now we are transitioning into real-time marriage. This is it.' Speaking about living together - or not living together - Allen said it was an arrangement they were both comfortable with. He said: 'I told her I could handle getting married and living together, just not both. And to my relief she said, ""OK let's get married and keep our own places"". That's what I was hoping for.' Colette said: 'When you're young you think, ""Oh, . weâre in love,"" all that. But when you get older, you say, ""You know, I . love you, but I need my space"".' Expensive: Allen leaves his spacious apartment on West 23rd street because the rent was increased to $1,800 . Tight squeeze: There is barely room for Collette's stuff in her Greenwich Village apartment nevermind her husbands . When Allen moved into Colette's tiny one-bedroom Greenwich Village apartment, where she has been for 31 years, even then they weren't prepared to fully live together. Instead of embracing cohabitation, the couple drew up battle lines, put up invisible walls and lay down a set of ground rules. According to the New York Post, there was no crossing into each other's space without permission, she had her own bedroom - where she generously said he could sleep at weekends - and he slept in a sofa bed in the living room. The end?: The couple are still blissfully in love after four years of marriage and living apart but will cohabiting change that? They have their own newspaper and magazine subscriptions,' watch their own TV shows from their own space and even have a shower rota. The kitchen - which also hosts the apartment's only shower - is the only place that is allowed for both couples any time of the day or night. Colette - a retired high-school teacher who now runs her home-made jewellery business - believes that not living together was the secret to their happy marriage. 'Getting married is a state of mind, I don't see why we have to live together. I don't need to see him brush his teeth,' she told the Post. 'It's bad enough I see him brush his hair. 'I donât know where this idea came from that you always have to be in the middle of whatever the other person is doing.' Alarmingly, she said when she told her ex-husband they were now living together he said: 'I give it four months.' The couple are featured in a documentary titled 'Two's a crowd' which will have its New York premiere at the Rooftop Films Summer Series on July 21.",New York couple happy for four years of marriage until recession saw husband give up his apartment and move in to hers .
"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 3:18 PM on 10th July 2011 . More than 40 bodies were found in Mexico in just 24 hours as vicious gun battles between rival drug cartels broke out in three different cities. In the northern city of Monterrey, where the Zetas gang is fighting its former ally, at least 20 people died and more than five were injured when gunmen opened fire in a bar, in the city's worst mass killing in recent memory. Earlier police found one survivor in a pile of 11 bodies dumped near a well on the outskirts of Mexico City. All had been shot with high-powered rifles. Mounting death toll: Forensic workers carry bodies one by one away from the scene of a shooting in Monterrey, Mexico, where at least 20 people were killed . After those shootings on Friday, ten mutilated bodies were found early on Saturday morning in the northern city of Torreon. They had been shot several days before. Federal security spokesman Alejandro Poire said: 'The violence is a product of this criminal rivalry... surrounding the intent to control illegal activities in a community, and not the only the earnings that come with it, but also with transporting drugs to the United States.' State officials said the bodies in Torreon, where the Zetas are fighting the Sinaloa cartel headed by Joaquin 'El Chapo' Guzman, were found in a sports-utility vehicle. Seven were men and three were women. Violence has spiked in Monterrey since the Zetas broke their alliance with the Gulf cartel early last year. Terror on the streets: The bar in Monterrey where 20 people were killed after gunmen opened fire in a battle between the Zetas and a rival cartel . On guard: Soldiers and federal policemen stand watch outside a bar in Monterrey as a forensics team remove a dead body from the scene . In Friday's shootings, 16 people died at the Sabino Gordo bar. Four others died later at the hospital and five were injured, said Jorge Domene, security spokesman for the state of Nuevo Leon, where Monterrey is located. Other downtown businesses closed earlier than usual after news of the massacre broke. In Valle de Chalco, a working class suburb southeast of Mexico City, a man was found alive among the dumped bodies and was taken to a hospital, said Antonio Ortega, a spokesman for the Mexico State police. He said some of the bodies were blindfolded and had their hands tied. Poire said one woman was found seriously injured. State officials said police found another body nearby a few hours later but could not confirm it was related to the mass attack, which happened during a fight between the Zetas and the Knights Templar, an offshoot of the infamous La Familia gang. Ortega said he didn't know if the victims were shot at the scene or were taken to site. Terror in Monterrey: Police investigate the scene of a shooting in Mexico, where bullet holes mark the wall. Police say 20 were killed and five injured . The capital region has been largely spared the widespread drug violence that grips parts of Mexico. But some poorer areas of the sprawling metropolis of 20 million people have begun to see killings and decapitations committed by street gangs that are remnants of splintered drug cartels. In another incident allegedly involving Zetas, the Mexican Navy said on Friday it rescued a Humberto Valdez, a former mayor of Reynosa, who had been kidnapped along with his son. Four alleged Zeta members were arrested at the scene after an anonymous tip informed the navy of his abduction the day before. Mr Poire repeated the government's insistence that criminals, not the government's crackdown on organized crime, are causing the violence. More than 35,000 people have died since President Felipe Calderon stepped up the attack on organized crime in 2006, according to official figures. Some groups put the number at more than 40,000. Heavy death toll: Members of a forensic team work together to move slain bodies into a coroner's van in the northern city of Monterrey, Mexico . He said: 'The violence won't stop if we stop battling criminals. The violence will diminish as we accelerate our capacity to debilitate the gangs that produce it.' Federal authorities arrested La Familia's alleged leader in late June, claiming the arrest was a debilitating blow to the gang. Jose de Jesus Mendez Vargas was alleged to be the last remaining head of the cartel, whose splinter group, the Knights Templar, continues to fight for control of areas La Familia once dominated. Mexican authorities also arrested Jesus Enrique Rejon Aguilar, a co-founder of the Zetas drug cartel who is suspected of involvement in the February killing of a U.S. customs agent.","At least 20 people die in Monterrey in bar shooting .

"By . Claire Bates . Last updated at 4:56 PM on 6th September 2011 . The Health and Social Care Bill will 'significantly curtail' public access to information, particularly about the private sector, campaigners have warned. The Campaign for Freedom of Information has written to Health Secretary Andrew Lansley outlining how the Bill will restrict access to information about the activity of private companies working under NHS contracts. While the NHS bodies commissioning services will be subject to the Freedom of Information (FoI) Act, those bodies providing services will not, it says. Freedom of information: A ward clerk files records at Kings College Hospital, London. Campaigners say information about health practices will be more restricted under the reforms . A commissioning body can demand information from a private company to help them answer FoI requests, but only on specific details already laid down in the contract between the NHS and the independent provider. Campaign director Maurice Frankel said: 'Suppose there is concern about the use of potentially contaminated medical supplies by hospitals. 'For an NHS hospital, the FoI Act could be used to obtain details of stocks of the product, the number of doses administered, the numbers of affected patients, the quality control measures in place... 'This level of information would clearly not be available in relation to independent providers treating NHS patients. 'This would represent a major loss of existing information rights.' It has come on the same day that Professor Chris Ham, Chief Executive of the King's Fund, has warned the health changes are 'high risk.' 'It's a very complex set of charges, which are quite high risk in our view at a time where there are reall financial pressures in the health service,' the health charity chief told the BBC. He said the NHS faced a number of risks over the next two to three years as the bill would turn the health service 'upside down.' Meanwhile, campaigners say NHS bodies could lose out to independent providers during the early stages of the reforms because they will have to disclose their track record on treating patients while independents will not. 'NHS bodies would be forced to disclose any poor performance, while equally poorly performing independent providers may simply appear to have a blank sheet. 'The principle of patient choice would also be undermined by such unequal disclosure requirements.' The campaign says independent providers should be subject to the FoI Act in the same way as the NHS. Otherwise, separate FoI requests would have to be made to each of the commissioning bodies with whom a provider has a contract. A request may then be refused on cost grounds, where the cost of investigating rises above Â£450.","NHS changes are 'high risk', warns King's Fund chief ."
"By . Daniel Bates . Last updated at 12:00 PM on 8th September 2011 . Rick Perry sealed his position as GOP front-runner last night after he eased through his first presidential TV debate with a straight-talking and confident performance. The Texas governor defied expectations he might falter on the national stage and batted off challenges from Mitt Romney on the economy, healthcare and social security. Pulling no punches he repeated his controversial claims that social security is a 'Ponzi scheme', revealed that he backed the opening of Guantanamo Bay and won a huge round of applause for his staunch support of the death penalty. Pulling no punches: Republican presidential candidate Texas Governor Rick Perry speaks during a Republican presidential candidate debate at the Reagan Library on Wednesday . Clearly the focus of the debate he at one point admitted to feeling like a 'Pinata' because he came under so many attacks. But the big loser of the night was Michele Bachmann who faded as the debate went on and fared worse than even Newt Gingrich. Having lost half of her support in . recent weeks she now faces grave questions over whether she can mount a . serious challenge - making it more likely than ever the contest is a . two-horse race. The debate, the second in the race to . become the Republican presidential candidate, puts Perry in a strong . position but also gave voters the biggest glimpse of his outlook. He was combative and put forward the . most coherent philosophy of all the candidates - including refuting the . idea that mankind is behind climate change. He also draw a clear line between . himself and Romney on a range of issues and left the former . Massachusetts governor looking defensive at times. Coming up short: Representative Michele Bachmann (L) faded as the debate went on while Perry and Governor of Massachusetts Mitt Romney (R) sparred during the event . The audience at the Reagan library in Simi Valley, California did not have to wait long to see the pair clash. The sharpest divide was over social . security during which Perry said that it was a 'monstrous lie,' adding, 'It's a Ponzi scheme . to tell our kids that are 25 and 30-years-old today you're paying into . a programme that's going to be there. 'Anybody that's for the status quo with social security today is involved with a monstrous lie to our kids. 'I don't care what anyone says, we know that, the American people know that and those 25 and 30-year-old people know that.' Romney however said he would do the opposite and vowed to save social security. 'You say that by any measure social security is a failure,' he said with a passion which has so far been lacking in his campaign. 'You can't say that to tens of . millions of Americans who live on social security...our nominee has to . be somebody who isn't committed to abolishing social security but is . committed to saving social security.' But in his rebuttal Perry came back . and said: 'Maybe it's time to have some provocative language in this . country and say things like let's get America working again and do . whatever it takes to make that happen'. Republican presidential candidates, from left: Rick Santorum, Newt Gingrich, Michele Bachmann, Mitt Romney, Rick Perry, Ron Paul, Herman Cain and Jon Huntsman stand at their podiums to answer questions . The two men also disagreed over healthcare and spent the first seven minutes of the debate sniping about the economy. In an exchange which went back and . forth five times Romney made made a dig referring to Perry's links to . former Democratic presidential candidate Al Gore. But then Perry sniped: '(Former Massachusetts governor) Michael Dukakis created jobs three times faster than you did, Mitt.' As the crowd cheered Romney replied: . 'As a matter of fact George Bush and his predecessor at a faster rate . than you did governor.' As the debate wore on the audience . warmed to Perry and even applauded when host Brian Ross read out the . fact that 234 people had been executed by the state of Texas. In a series of unapologetic answers he . laid out his philosophy on climate change â which he denied was . definitely linked to mankind â and foreign policy. In a clear reference to the Libyan . invasion he said that the U.S. should not invade another country unless . American interests were clearly at stake. His comments on the death penalty, however, were his most blunt. Taking a stand: Republican presidential hopeful and former U.S. Senator Rick Santorum (L) listens on stage and presidential hopeful and businessman Herman Cain (R) speaks during the debate . Outspoken: Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives Newt Gingrich (L) won a huge cheer for a bitter attack on Barack Obama while Governor of Utah Jon Huntsman (R) listened during the debate . In the race: Republican presidential candidate and U.S. Representative Ron Paul speaks during the Republican Presidential Candidates debate at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library on Wednesday . He said: 'In the state of Texas, if . you come into our state and you kill one of our children, you kill a . police officer, you're involved in another crime and you kill one of our . citizens you will face the ultimate justice and that is you will be . executed.' The focus on the two men left the rest . of the candidates looking like bystanders, although Gingrich was better . than the last debate and won a huge cheer for a bitter attack on Barack . Obama. The night's big casualty was Bachmann who looked tired and seemed to dry up as the debate went on. She only won a moderate round of applause for her comments on the economy and for opposing the invasion of Libya. Her support has crumbled in recent weeks from 16 per cent to eight per cent and she is now all but out of the race. Speaking after the debate Eugene . Robinson of the Washington Post said that Bachmann had 'dropped out of . the first tier into the second tier.' MSNBC political host Al Sharpton went further and said she had 'left the race tonight'. Republican presidential candidates, from left: Rick Santorum, Newt Gingrich, Michele Bachmann, Mitt Romney, Rick Perry, Ron Paul, Herman Cain and Jon Huntsman stand together before the debate . Turning to Perry he said that the Texan's performance had 'fed red meat to his base'. He added: 'I don't think Romney made any major mistakes. I was surprised he wasn't as rattled as he could have been'. Political commentator Ed Schultz said that Perry did what his supporters wanted him to do by 'not backing down'; . 'This guy is solid in his philosophy and that's what helps in the right wing of the party,' adding that . Bachmann was 'not as smooth' as she had been before. Larry Sabato of the Centre for . Politics at the University of Virginia pointed out that some of Perry's . views might cause him problems further down the line, notably his stance . on climate change. After the debate he tweeted: 'Perry has both won & lost debate. Republicans liked what he said & how he said it. 'But Social Security comments are BIG swing voter problem.' The other candidates in the debate were Texas Representative Ron Paul, former Utah Governor Jon Huntsman, former pizza magnate Herman Cain and former Pennsylvania Senator Rick Santorum. Social Security: 'It is monstrous lie, it's a Ponzi scheme to tell our kids that are 25 and 30-years-old today you're paying into a programme that's going to be there. 'Anybody that's for the status quo with Social Security today is involved with a monstrous lie to our kids. 'I don't care what anyone says, we know that, the American people know that and those 25 and 30-year-old people know that.'The death penalty: 'In the state of Texas, if you come into our state and you kill one of our children, you kill a police officer, you're involved in another crime and you kill one of our citizens you will face the ultimate justice, and that is you will be executed. 'Americans understand justice. I think Americans are clearly in the vast majority of cases supportive of capital punishment. 'When you have committed heinous crimes against our citizens, in the state of Texas... you will face the ultimate justice.'Climate change: 'I do agree that the science is not settled on this. 'The idea we would put Americans' economy in jeopardy based on scientific theory that is not settled yet to me is nonsense. 'Just because you have a group of scientists who stood up and said this is the fact... Galileo got outvoted for a spell. 'To put Americans' economic future in jeopardy, asking us to cut back in areas that would have monstrous economic impact on this country is not good economics and I would suggest is not necessarily good science. 'Find out what the science truly is before you start putting the American economy in jeopardy.'George W Bush and Guantanamo Bay: 'He maintained the chase and we took out a very bad man in the form of bin Laden. I tip my hat to him. 'He kept Gitmo open against the will of his base and I'm glad he did that. America's safer for it.'Foreign policy: 'I don't think America needs to be in the business of adventurism. 'Americans don't want to see their young men and women going into foreign countries without a clear reason that American interests are at stake. 'They want to see a clear exit strategy as well.'The economy: 'What Americans are looking for is somebody who can get this country working again. 'We created one million jobs in state of Texas at the same time America lost two and a half million. 'Americans are focused on the right issue and that is who on this stage can get America working?'The deficit: 'We have to cut the snake's head off. Until you get a balanced budget amendment then the American people can go to sleep at night with a little more comfort and know they're not going to be broke in the morning.'","Perry repeated controversial claims Social Security is a 'Ponzi scheme'

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 1:19 PM on 9th September 2011 . UK Independence Party leader Nigel Farage will today accuse David Cameron of 'mass deception' of Conservative voters over immigration and a referendum on the EU. To attract the euro-sceptic wing of the Conservatives he will use a speech to the UKIP annual conference to accuse the Tories of making pre-election promises on Europe they never wanted to keep. An English Parliament is needed to resolve the tensions . caused by devolution of some powers to Scotland, Wales and Northern . Ireland, he will also claim. Tory backbenches are angry over European policy with a group of young MPs meeting on Monday to discuss Britain's relations with the EU and eurosceptic Bill Cash's bill demanding a referendum on the UK being part of the Union. Under fire: David Cameron, pictured yesterday, will be accused by UKIP leader Nigel Farage today of making pre-election promises on the EU he never intended to keep . In a full-scale attack on Conservative credentials on the EU, Mr Farage will tell the conference that there has been a 'total breakdown in trust' in all the major parties, with Labour voters disillusioned by the financial crisis and Iraq and Lib Dems by the U-turn on tuition fees. 'But those who must be feeling the most let down, the most disappointed, are the millions of Conservative voters who believed the promises of David Cameron,' he will say. 'They have begun to realise that when Mr Cameron makes promises about EU referendums, immigration figures or human rights legislation, that he is doing so simply to get their vote without ever meaning it himself. 'The Tories' election strategy is one of mass deception and if you're a patriotic, anti-EU Tory voter then your party has disappeared.' It comes a day after it emerged that Tory MPs are plotting to join forces with Labour Eurosceptics to try to force Mr Cameron to take a harder line on the EU. The Prime Minister â who yesterday . held talks in Downing Street with Europeâs self-styled âpresidentâ Herman Van Rompuy â dismissed calls for an âin-outâ referendum on . Britainâs membership. He told MPs there was âno caseâ for such a vote and insisted Britain must make Europe âwork for usâ. But there are increasing signs that the . issue of Europe is being seized on by Conservative MPs as a symbol of . wider frustrations with the way their pro-EU Liberal Democrat coalition . partners are influencing government policy . Firm: Prime Minister David Cameron, with the President of the European Council Herman Van Rompuy, dismissed calls for a referendum on membership and says Europe 'must work' for Britain . A day after the Government announced the creation of a commission to investigate the so-called West Lothian question, the Ukip leader will say that his party is the first to draw up serious proposals to answer calls for 'English votes for English laws'. 'What we have in the UK at the moment is a situation where the English people are the ones most likely to break up the Union because they feel used and under-represented,' Mr Farage will say. 'Ukip realise that something needs to change and that the UK must be based on equality and fairness. 'That's why we have developed a proposal which would put an end to the disastrous devolution policies enacted by Labour which has only damaged the Union and brought about ill-feeling between the different nations. 'It shows that we take the notion of Englishness seriously without wanting to damage the pride of being Scottish, Welsh or Northern Irish.' No decision on whether to adopt the English Parliament as party policy is expected for some time. Meanwhile, former Conservative MP Neil .

This is the dramatic moment a pharmacist used his own gun to ward off masked raiders who burst into his store during a late night robbery. Jeremy Hoven was fired from his pharmacy job at Walgreens in Benton Township, Michigan, despite being hailed a hero for using his firearm to defend the store. Now chilling footage has emerged of the armed masked robbers bursting into the store and holding a manager at gunpoint during the raid at 4.30am on May 8. Defending himself: Jeremy Hoven opened fire towards masked raiders after they burst into the pharmacy at 4.30am . Terrifying: Thieves had seconds earlier burst into the store and help up a manager at gunpoint . Spotted: Mr Hoven shot towards the robbers after deciding to 'do what I had to do' The shocking video shows one of the men leap over the counter after leading the employee with a gun pointed at his back. But as the robbers attempt to make off with items from the store, quick-thinking Mr Hoven draws his own weapon and fires several downward shots in their direction. The two men are immediately rattled and hastily scramble away out of the store, their robbery foiled. Mr Hoven was hailed a hero by locals and gun rights activists, but was nonetheless sacked from his job by Walgreens bosses. The three other employees at the store at the time have praised Mr Hoven for his bravery and quick thinking. No customers were apparently in the building. Scarpered: The raiders were scared from the store by Mr Hoven, who was hailed a hero but fired from his job . The pharmacist told the Herald-Palladium at the time: 'In my mind, I can look at myself in the mirror. I can lay my head down in bed and sleep. In my mind, I did what I had to do.' The 36-year-old is now pursuing legal action for wrongful dismissal. Hoven's court papers say he had a permit to carry a concealed weapon and only used it to protect himself and other store staff . Mr Hoven also told the Herald-Palladium he had tried to call 911 during the raid, 'but couldn't get it done'. 'Within seconds he was over the counter. And I'm looking at the wrong end of a 9-millimeter (gun). He was holding it gangster-style (sideways)', Mr Hoven said. Shot up: Jeremy Hoven was fired from his pharmacy job at this Walgreens in Benton Township, Michigan, after he shot at armed robbers there . He said he started firing to 'create a safe zone for myself'. 'I was reacting out of fear, and the adrenaline was taking over... You could have probably taken my pulse from my breath because my heart was beating that much', he said. Mr Hoven has worked as a night shift pharmacist at the store since 2007, when it opened. He told the paper he decided to get a concealed weapon permit after the store was robbed in 2007, but had felt management hadn't done enough to address security. The company contests Hoven's claims that it neglected safety after the 2007 robbery. 'We've made significant investments in security technology in recent years, including increasing the number of digital surveillance cameras at our stores,' the company said. 'We continue to invest in state-of-the-art security measures and high-definition surveillance equipment and hope that the apprehension of robbery suspects in the Benton Harbor area will prevent future crimes.'",Jeremy Hoven fired despite being hailed a hero .
"By . Jason Groves, Political Correspondent . Last updated at 2:48 AM on 10th September 2011 . International Monetary Fund (IMF) managing director Christine Lagarde arrives for a meeting of the G7 Finance ministers in Marseill . George Osborne yesterday dismissed calls for him to change course on the economy â as he insisted that his deficit reduction plan is the ârock of stabilityâ for Britainâs recovery. The Chancellor held fast to his view that the Governmentâs plans were flexible enough to deal with a deteriorating economic situation. Mr Osborne received the backing of IMF head Christine Lagarde, who said Britainâs plans remained âappropriateâ. But she added that spending cuts could tip Britain back into recession . if they were carried out too fast â a warning Labour immediately seized . on. The Chancellor joined Treasury ministers from the G7 countries at a . summit in Marseilles, France, where they were struggling to agree on how . to tackle the eurozone debt crisis and faltering global economy. Hours after President Barack Obama announced a Â£280billion spending . package to boost jobs in the U.S. Mr Osborne dismissed suggestions that . Britain should follow a similar course to kick-start growth. The . Chancellor â who himself admitted this week growth forecasts are likely . to be downgraded â said that ditching the Coalitionâs package of cuts . and tax rises would undermine international confidence in Britain and . could push up interest rates. He said: âWe will stick to the deficit reduction plan we have set out. It is the rock of stability on which our economy is built. âIt has delivered record low interest rates. Abandoning it would put . that at risk. Nothing would be more damaging for Britain at this fragile . moment for the worldâs economy than an increase in mortgage rates and . an increase in the cost of borrowing.â This graph shows a similar pattern to the 18 months before the 2008 recession . Growth in non-OECD countries looks like it's set to slow down as well . Speaking in London, Mrs Lagarde said the risks from stagnating growth . were growing, and had to be weighed against the huge deficits carried by . many Western economies. She said although tackling deficits was crucial, âconsolidation, if it . happens too quickly, will hurt the economy and worsen job prospectsâ. She warned that ministers needed to be ânimbleâ in responding to a fresh . downturn. George Osborne today met IMF head Christine Lagarde where the pair agreed the UK's approach to deficit reduction was appropriate . She added: âThe policy stance [in the UK] was premised on a greater role . for private sector demand, especially a robust recovery in exports, to . take over as the public sector retrenched. But since the summer the . outlook has been more subdued, including in particular Europe... and the . U.S., which are the two main trading partners of the UK. âThe policy stance remains appropriate. But the heightened risk means a heightened readiness to respond, particularly if it looks like the economy is headed for weak growth.â She also suggested there was âroomâ for the Bank of England to carry out another round of printing money, adding that the ârisk of recessionâ currently outweighed the ârisk of inflationâ. Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls said: âChristine Lagarde is right to repeat her warning that cutting too quickly will hurt the recovery and jobs. This is clearly a message aimed at America, the eurozone and Britain too.â The Eurozone looks set to take a hit while the US and Japan will grow . â âBarack Obama began a tour of the . U.S. yesterday to drum up support for his Â£280billion package to boost . the countryâs jobs market. The plans seek to create jobs through . spending heavily on upgrading roads, bridges and school buildings. The . President urged Congress to pass the bill âquicklyâ. But Right-wingers . say the plans simply add to Americaâs mountain of debt. Spend, spend, spend: U.S. President Barack Obama last night announced a Â£250billion jobs plan . Savers have been warned that the rock-bottom rates that have frozen their nest eggs will not rise âuntil 2013â. The Bank of England cut the base rate to 0.5 per cent in March 2009, the lowest level in history. And for the 30th consecutive month, it voted yesterday to keep this base rate, the longest period of unchanged rates since the Second World War. Economists have warned savers, who are being hit by account interest rates as low as 0.1 per cent, that it is likely to last for at least another year. But Howard Archer, chief UK economist at the consultancy IHS Global Insight, said: âWe suspect that interest rates are unlikely to rise before 2013.â Homeowners with a variable mortage can look forward to a further extended period of low rates. But for savers, the income from their savings, which many pensioners rely on, has all but disappeared. Simon Rose, from the campaign group Save Our Savers, added: âCurrent policies are squeezing savers to the brink of extinction.â A recent poll by the price comparison site MoneySupermarket of more than 7,200 adults said more than half would like to see a rate rise âin the near futureâ.","Growth will be just 0.3 per cent in the last three months of the year, the OECD says .

"Gangland boss Noye stabbed 21-year-old on M25 in front of the victim's fiancee . By . Louise Boyle . Last updated at 8:43 PM on 9th September 2011 . Comforts for a killer: Kenneth Noye, who stabbed a man to death on the M25, has been secretly moved to a minimum-security prison at Lowdham Grange, near Nottingham . The M25 road rage killer Kenneth Noye has been moved to a âholiday campâ jail after his security status was downgraded. Noye, 64, was jailed for life in 2000 for the murder of 21-year-old Stephen Cameron, whom he stabbed to death during a fight on the M25 four years earlier. The multi-millionaire gangland killer, who fled to Spain after the stabbing in 1996 but was extradited two years later, denied murder, instead claiming that it was self defence â a claim rejected by an Old Bailey jury. Just two years before the stabbing he had been released from jail after serving eight years of aÂ  14-year sentence for his part in the Â£26million Brinkâs-Mat bullion robbery in 1983. Yesterday it emerged that he has been secretly transferred from Whitemoor, a high security jail near March in Cambridgeshire, to the Category B Lowdham Grange, near Nottingham. Inmates at Lowdham Grange have described the prison as a âholiday campâ, with individual cells, personal televisions, PlayStations, fridges and en-suite bathrooms. Sources have said it is to prepare him for his release, which could come in as little as four yearsâ time. Despite being viewed as a model prisoner by guards at Whitemoor, his move has infuriated the family of his victim. Victim: Stephen Cameron, 21, who was knifed to death by Noye, with his girlfriend Danielle Cable. He died at the Swanley interchange in Kent in May 1996 . At his new digs in Lowdham Grange, Kenneth Noye will be able to enjoy a string of luxuries. In what will surely make uncomfortable reading for the Cameron family, their son's killer will be able to stock his own fridge and kick back with a Playstation. He will also be able to watch television and take a shower in his en-suite cell. So cushy is the category B  facility near Nottingham, it has been nicknamed the 'holiday camp' by prisoners. Noye will also be allowed his own bedding and to wear his own clothes, while cells come equipped with hobby kits. He'll be able to keep trim with a range of fitness classes, including volleyball and badminton. The prison also offers courses in arts and crafts, computer studies and creative writing to name but a few should Noye want to further his education. The facility is a training prison so Noye can also sign up to vocational courses including gardening and sports studies. According to a report from May, prisoners spent 'plenty of time' out of their cells.' Stephen Cameronâs father Ken, 64, . said: âHe is still a very dangerous man. A leopard never changes its . spots. But now heâs going to get a softer time inside.â Speaking from his home in Norfolk, he . added: âThey are moving him to a softer prison and didnât even let us . know. Itâs outrageous. Out of courtesy I would hope we would have been . notified. âHeâs got around three-and-a-half years to go in prison. Surely this is too early to de-categorise him to Category B? âWith his money and contacts it must make it easier for him to attempt to escape.â Prison officers at Whitemoor are said . to have been given a secret briefing at 7am on Thursday. Noye was then . placed in a van where he was handcuffed to a guard and driven from . Cambridgeshire to Nottinghamshire. Six years ago he had been moved to . another jail after Whitemoor officers were said to have discovered that . he had arranged to have a mobile phone â with which he planned to . co-ordinate a breakout â smuggled into the unit in a box of Weetabix. He was transferred under armed guard . to the maximum security Full Sutton prison in York before later being . moved back to Whitemoor. Noye was involved in laundering the proceeds of the Brinkâs-Mat robbery in the 1980s. While under investigation in 1985 he . stabbed to death an undercover detective, John Fordham, in the grounds . of his home in West Kingsdown, Kent. Noye was cleared of murder on the . grounds that he was acting in self defence. He was, however, convicted of handling . stolen gold and sentenced to 14 years in prison. He was released in . 1994. Mr Cameron was murdered in 1996. Noye was convicted in 2000 and appeals . in 2001 and 2004 failed. But last year his case was referred to the . Court of Appeal by the Criminal Cases Review Commission. Earlier this year he lost his attempt at the Court of Appeal to overturn his murder conviction.

"By . Richard Hartley-parkinson . Last updated at 12:57 PM on 10th September 2011 . Detectives are back in Portugal to review the case in the search for Maddie (pictured) Scotland Yard detectives reviewing the investigation into the disappearance of Madeleine McCann have travelled to Portugal for the first time to have 'formal' meetings with authorities there. While officers from Leicestershire had regular contact with police chiefs in the south European country during their search for the youngster it is only now that senior officers from the Met have headed to the Iberian peninsula. Madeleine was nearly four when she went missing from her family's holiday flat in Praia da Luz in the Algarve on May 3, 2007 as her parents dined with friends nearby. A Metropolitan Police spokesman said: 'MPS officers travelled to Portugal at the beginning of August and had their first formal meeting with Portuguese authorities to discuss ways to progress the investigative review.' Portuguese detectives' investigation - helped by officers from Leicestershire Police - into her disappearance prompted appeals for help across the world. But the official inquiry was formally shelved in July 2008 and since then no police force has been actively looking for the missing child, who would now be eight. Her parents, Kate and Gerry McCann were said to be 'extremely pleased' that UK police met with forces in Portugal and hope there will be positive developments. Spokesman for the family Clarence Mitchell said: 'Kate and Gerry are extremely pleased that the review is progressing. It is a positive step in the right direction.' The meeting happened in secret a month ago, according to The Daily Express, but news of the meeting has only just emerged. Ahead of the developments in Portugal, the McCanns met with police several times. A source said: 'They are relieved. Things are finally being done and Kate and Gerry are being kept informed of every move.' The . Met launched a review of the original investigation in May after a . request from Home Secretary Theresa May supported by . David Cameron. Hundreds of . possible sightings of the little girl have been reported around the . world since she went missing, but so far they have all come to nothing. Kate and Gerry McCann were said to be 'extremely pleased' with the meeting between British and Portugese police forces . In her most recent interview, Mrs McCann said she believes the kidnapper who took Madeleine may also have drugged her other two children. She said when she first realised Madeleine was missing she had to check that twins Sean and Amelie were still breathing because they did not wake as the frantic search for the missing three-year-old began. She also believes the whoever took her daughter may have gone to the holiday flat the night before but fled after being disturbed. In May this year, the Prime Minister asked Scotland Yard to carry out a review of the investigation to bring a 'new perspective' to the case. But the move prompted questions about why the review could not have been carried out earlier, when evidence was fresher. And critics will question whether there is any realistic prospect of a breakthrough in the case, which has seen no major developments since Madeleineâs disappearance.","Talks take place after Cameron ordered a review .

The worst storms for 15 years are on the way as the tail end of a hurricane hits our shores this weekend. Gales of up to 80mph will set in tomorrow night, prompting warnings of damage to buildings, falling trees, flooding and transport chaos. The Met Office issued a rare near-nationwide weather alert for Monday and said there were no areas that could be ruled out. The warning comes as the remains of Hurricane Katia, which whipped up 22ft waves off the U.S. east coast, move across the Atlantic today. By the time Katia reaches the UK, the winds will be just below tropical storm force â the same level as those that hit New York last month. After a cloudy day today and tomorrow, stormy winds will hit the South West, Midlands, North of England and Scotland tomorrow evening. A yellow alert â which warns people to be on their guard â has been issued for all of the country except the South East, but this could be upgraded to the more serious amber level today as the storm closes in. The warning, says: 'The public should be aware of the risk of disruption to transport and of the possibility of damage to trees and structures.' Weather expert Tom Tobler from MeteoGroup UK said:: 'It is looking like the storms will hit early Monday morning with the most severe weather coming in the middle of the day.

David Cameron was yesterday told he faced the 'fight of his life' after announcing plans to open up nearly every part of Britain's public services to competition from theÂ  private sector. Union leaders reacted with fury as the Prime Minister vowed to press ahead with the biggest reform of public services for more than 50 years. The long-awaited White Paper contains plans for private and voluntary organisations to be able to bid to run every part of public service except national security, frontline policing and the judiciary. Mr Cameron warned that the 'old narrow, closed, state monopoly' was dead and the State would be forced to justify why it cannot be opened up to outside competition. The Prime Minister said his wide-ranging reforms would have an impact up and down the country and would be felt in 'every state school, hospital and prison, by every doctor, teacher, parent, patient and citizen'. Mr Cameron vowed he would not 'pull back or lose heart' from the job of modernising public services in the face of angry opposition from the unions, Liberal Democrats and Labour. Other proposals in the White Paper include the introduction of a legal right for the public to choose in every area of public services â from where they send their children to school to where they have an operation. The consumer organisation Which? will also be given new powers to fight for consumers in the public sector as well as the private. And residents will be given unprecedented new powers to run council services â from libraries and museums to parks and swimming pools. Under the plans, parish councils will be given sweeping new powers to run local neighbourhoods, including licensing pubs, banning strip clubs and bringing in parking schemes. The White Paper proposes that . residents form John Lewis-style 'mutuals' â where they can decide how to . run services. These groups will be given cash budgets to buy in . services from health through to education. The moves are the latest . expansion of Mr Cameron's 'Big Society' plan. In a speech to the ReformÂ  campaign group in London, Mr Cameron said: 'We want to see democracy on a properly hyper-local scale. 'You and the people you know â the people you wave to on your way to work in the morning â having genuine control over the things that matter to you: Improvements to your streets, your roads, your local parks. 'We haven't seen power this local for generations. 'The old dogma that said âWhitehall knows bestâ â it's gone.' Bob Crow, leader of the Rail, Maritime and Transport Union, said: 'This Government would privatise the air that we breathe if they thought that they could get away with it. 'If David Cameron seriously thinks he can flog off what's left of the family silver to the same greed merchants who created this crisis then he will have the fight of his life on his hands.' Unison leader Dave Prentis added: 'The collapse of home care owners Southern Cross should act as a grim warning about what can happen when the private sector take over public services.' Opponents: The RMT union's Bob Crow, left, . accused the government of selling of the family silver, while Unison's .

"By . Paul Milligan . Last updated at 4:31 PM on 10th September 2011 . Sir Stuart Rose would be prepared to pay more tax to help the country . One of the biggest names in British business has told the government not to scrap the new 50p rate of income tax. The former head of Marks & Spencer, Sir Stuart Rose has not only said he opposes the move but is happy to pay more tax to help the country out of its current financial difficulties. Rose is the biggest name so far to oppose the move which has been backed by a group of 20 economists on Wednesday, who feel the levy is hurting the UK's competitiveness. Rose told BBC Radio 4's Hard Talk yesterday: 'I don't think that they should reduce the income tax rate. How would I explain to my secretary that I am getting less tax on my income, which is palpably bigger than hers, when hers is now going down?' Rose's comments are in stark contrast to former Conservative Chancellor Nigel . Lawson who urged George Osborne to axe the 50p top rate of income tax, . warning it is 'dangerous' and 'foolish' to leave it in place. Lord Lawson admitted it would be politically difficult for the government to slash the levy on the country's top earners but insisted . it would be 'better' to push the change through soon. Earlier this week President Barack . Obama outlined plans for a larger payroll tax cut in an effort to assist . the struggling US economy. Rose is not alone in calling for the rich to pay more taxes, with severalÂ  high-profile names adding their weight to the debate. Billionaire investor Warren Buffet urged Congress in August to raise taxes for millionaires, arguing they have survived the financial crisis better than those poorest in society. Warren Buffett has also backed calls for the super-rich to pay more tax . Writing in the New York Times Buffet said: 'While the poor and middle class fight for us in Afghanistan, and while most Americans struggle to make ends meet, we mega-rich continue to get our extraordinary tax breaks. 'My friends and I have been coddled long enough by a billionaire-friendly Congress. 'Itâs time for our government to get serious about shared sacrifice.' Buffett's tax rate last year was 17 per cent, compared with an average of 36 per cent for his employees at his Berkshire Hathaway company. Wealthy figures from across Europe have also echoed Buffett's call, with Italian Formula One magnate Luca di Montezemolo publicly backing his ideas 'for reasons of fairness and solidarity.' Others to back calls for increased income tax for the rich include L'Oreal billionaire hieress Liliane Bettencourt and Christophe de Margerie, the chief executive of oil company Total. Rose left his post as chief executive and chairman of Marks & Spencer earlier this year. 'Be brave, Lucinda. We all have to make sacrifices. So you may not be getting Liz Taylor's jewellery for Christmas.' The Treasury is to review the impact of the tax over the coming months, with a decision to scrap it likely in the 2012 budget. Liberal Democrats are expected to oppose the move until proposals to exclude those earning less than Â£10,000 are added.",But ex-chancellor Nigel Lawson deems it 'dangerous' to keep rate in place .

'At the end of the day, this is supposed to be the land of the brave, home of the free, democracy, freedom of speech. 'The way they were treating him, none of that existed. Why should he go to jail for something he didn't do?' High profile: Los Angeles Superior Court has released the juror questionnaire for the trial of Conrad Murray, Michael's private doctor, on charges of manslaughter . Denial: Conrad Murray is accused of administering a fatal dose of the anaesthetic propofol which contributed to the King of Pop's death in June 2009 . In June 2005, Michael was found not guilty of all charges after a four-month trial. He had been accused of molesting Gavin Arvizo, then 13, giving him alcohol and plotting to kidnap him and his family. Jermaine, 56, describes in his book - You Are Not Alone: Michael Through A Brother's Eyes - that he made a phone call to guarantee the flight to Bahrain was still available. He also revealed he would revoke his own U.S. citizenship if Michael was convicted and would help to move his entire family to Bahrain - which does not have an extradition treaty with the U.S. It comes after details of the jury questionnaire in the manslaughter trial of Michael's private doctor, Conrad Murray, were revealed. Among 113 questions to potential jurors, the judge has asked how much attention they have paid to high-profile cases in the media, TMZ reported. They include: . Family act: The Jackson 5 - from left, Tito, Marlon, Michael, Jackie and Jermaine, perform during the 'Sonny and Cher Comedy Hour' in 1972 . Public opinion: A man holds up signs supporting Dr Murray outside the Criminal Courts building in Los Angeles. They have been fears raised over whether he can get a fair trial . Refuge? The plot would have seen Michael flown to Bahrain, where Jermaine Jackson was working during his 2005 trial, in a private jet . The questionnaire also asks jurors whether they know any of the potential witnesses, including Michael's siblings Janet and La Toya, as well as his children Paris, Prince and Blanket. Michael Jackson died on June 25, 2009, from an overdose of the anaesthetic propofol complicated by other medications. Authorities have accused Murray of administering the fatal dose in the bedroom of Jackson's rented mansion. He denies the charges. Murray could face four years in prison if convicted of involuntary manslaughter. Opening statements are scheduled to begin on September 27.","Middle Eastern kingdom does not have extradition treaty with U.S.

"By . Chris Greenwood and Daniel Bates . Last updated at 10:25 AM on 12th September 2011 . A millionaire fraudster who gave a record Â£2.4million to the Lib Dems was being hunted in his Caribbean hideout last night after three years on the run. Michael Brown, 45, is living under an assumed name in the Dominican Republic, which has no extradition treaty with Britain. Brown was convicted of stealing Â£36million from his clients in his absence in November 2008 after skipping bail and disappearing. He faces a seven-year jail sentence. Fraudster: Michael Brown and his wife Sharon in Mallorca in 2008. He donated Â£2.4million to the Lib. Dems . Rumours he fled to the Caribbean were . confirmed by police last night, who said they had been working urgently . behind the scenes for more than a year to bring him to justice. The news triggered fresh embarrassment for the Lib Dems as senior figures admitted they had spent all the money. Former leader Charles Kennedy said the donation â the biggest in the partyâs history â had âlong since been spentâ. He insisted the Lib Dems went the âextra mileâ to check out Brown before accepting the stolen cash ahead of the 2005 election. Extra mile: Former Lib Dem leader Charles Kennedy says the party checked out Brown, right, before accepting the stolen money in 2005 . Brown has been living a low-key life . of luxury on the island, renting expensive properties and playing golf . on exclusive courses. A photo from a golf club membership card revealed . he has lost weight, grown a beard and allowed his blond-dyed hair to . turn grey. It emerged two men suspected of helping him flee Britain and adopt a new identity were arrested and questioned last Friday. Senior officers are furious that the . details have emerged because negotiations to secure Brownâs extradition . were at a sensitive stage. No Briton has ever been forced to return from . the Dominican Republic but prosecutors remain hopeful they can secure a . ground-breaking deal. Mugshot: Michael Brown is trapped in the Dominican Republic . Last night, Brown had fled his luxury home but remained effectively trapped in the island country which neighbours Haiti. Detective Superintendent Bob Wishart, . of City of London Police, said: âWe remain determined to ensure Michael . Brown is returned to the UK to face justice and serve his sentence â . his victims and UK law demand no less.â Brown had been due to stand trial in . 2008 charged with 18 offences, including money laundering, theft and . perverting the course of justice. He posed as an international bond . dealer, pretended his father was a Lord, claimed connections with . royalty, and promised investors returns of up to 50 per cent. Among his . international array of victims was former Manchester United chairman . Martin Edwards, who handed over Â£8million. Brown mixed freely with senior Lib . Dem figures, and channelled his substantial cash gift to them through a . company called 5th Avenue Partners. The Electoral Commission investigated the affair but ruled the party did not have to hand back the money. The whereabouts of his wife of 15 years, Sharon, remains a mystery. Brownâs mother, Patricia, who lives in a modest bungalow in East Lothian, refused to comment last night. Speaking at the time of the donation, she said: âLet me just say that he has certain character flaws, and leave it at that.â Crook: Michael Brown donated Â£2.4million to the Lib Dems, but fraudulently obtained millions from various individuals including former Manchester United chairman Martin Edwards . Life of luxury: Michael Brown has been living in secret on the Dominican Republic for three years . Despite the Lib Dems not being obliged to hand the money back, some have argued that the party have a moral duty to do so as it came from a fraudster, but the Lib Dems have always refused. Vince Cable, when questioned on the matter last year by the BBCâs Jon Sopel insisted the party accepted the money âin good faithâ and would not be returning it. Brownâs escape before the trial was facilitated by convicted drug smuggler Paul Nally, who gave him a fake passport and travelled with him to the Dominican Republic on June 30 2008, according to The Sunday Telegraph. Nally came back a week later, but Brown stayed and set up bank accounts and real estate ventures using a fake name â Darren P Nally. Brownâs disappearance was only possible in the first place because another Lib Dem donor, Lord Strasburger, had put up the Â£250,000 bail money. However, he told The Sunday Telegraph that he simply wanted Brown to have âa fair trial and an opportunity to defend himself, whether he was innocent or notâ. He explained that Brownâs assets had been frozen because he was also facing a private prosecution for fraud by HSBC, so he couldnât afford to pay any lawyers. He added: âI just wanted there to be a level playing field so that justice could be served. âIt was not a political issue as far as I was concerned, it was all about justice. âIt was my decision alone and I had no input whatever from anyone else.â","Two men arrested in connection with the case .

"By . Nick Pisa . Last updated at 4:33 PM on 9th September 2011 . Relief: Amanda Knox at her appeal court hearing in Perugia . Jailed Amanda Knox today spoke of her relief that 'finally they believe me' as her hopes rose she will be cleared of the murder of Meredith Kercher. Knox, 24, is serving 26 years for the brutal killing of the 21-year-old British student, who was found semi naked and her throat slashed in her bedroom of the house they shared with two other women. Also convicted with her was her former boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito, 27, who was given 25 years. Both deny any involvement and have based their appeal on shaky forensic evidence that was used to jail them in their first trial but has now proved shockingly unreliable. Their hopes have been raised after two court appointed independent experts produced a report which condemned the original forensic investigation as shoddy with clear breaches of internationally recognised guidelines being breached raising the possibility of contamination. Earlier this week prosecutors - who admitted they are not confident the convictions will be upheld - had a request for a second review of the evidence denied by judge Claudio Pratillo Hellman. Turning down the plea, he said it was 'superfluous' and that he and the jury had heard enough, while her family insisted it proved the case against her was 'falling apart.' Guarded: Knox is held by an armed female officer as she arrives at her appeal hearing in Perugia . Court drama: Knox consults her lawyer at the appeal hearing surrounded by armed police officers . In an interview with local newspaper il Messaggero through her lawyer Luciano Ghirga, American Knox said:'Finally they believe me. I always knew that I would make it. I hope that I will be back home in the United States for Thanksgiving Day. It's great to know that at last they don't hate me any more, that they are not looking at me as if I am guilty, although not all of them believe me. Victim: Meredith Kercher was found with her throat slashed . 'Some still want to hurt me and I don't understand why. 'During the first trial I was so afraid to go in the witness box, there was such a hostile atmosphere. Every time I spoke and cried as I tried to explain that I had nothing to do with what happened that night, . 'I could tell people were laughing bemusedly and shrugging their shoulders. Now it's all changed.' When asked what her biggest secret was Knox replied:'I'm going to whisper it because I still don't believe it, because I'm still scared it could all change at the last minute, that they could still find me guilty. 'Ok I will tell you. My secret is that I always believed I would get out of jail, where my life had frozen, after getting the truth to emerge.' Knox, from Seattle, refused to comment on a film made about her earlier this year which starred Hayden Panettiere and said:'I don't want to talk about that, that's all part of the hatred that I am trying to beat. 'Meredith was my friend, I liked her, I could never hurt her.' Today her father Curt Knox visited his daughter in Capanne prison. Earlier this week he said that he was in Perugia, where the murder took place in November 2007, to 'take Amanda home' adding that the case was ''falling apart at the seams.' The hearing is due to resume with closing arguments and final speeches on September 23rd and a final verdict is expected a week later. Jail visit: Curt Knox, pictured with Amanda Knox's stepfather Chris Mellas, saw his daughter in Capanne prison . Rumours are already flying around Perugia that American TV networks are offering her a 'million dollar deal' to secure an exclusive interview with herÂ  if and when she is released. However her friend Madison Paxton, who moved to Perugia to be close to her, said:'She hasn't decided anything yet. Convicted killer: Raffaele Sollecito at his appeal . 'If she gets out she just wants to go home and spend time with her friends and family. She wants to get her life back.' Under Italian law Knox could launch a compensation claim against the judicial system if she is cleared and could be awarded 500,000 Euros in damages for the four years she has spent in jail. Key to the case is a 30cm kitchen knife found at Sollecito's apartment on which DNA from Knox was on the handle and that of Meredith, was discovered on the blade. However the independent report by Carla Vecchiotti and Stefano Conte of Rome's La Sapeinza University has questioned seriously the reliability of the findings by forensic scientists. Although they do not doubt Knox's DNA is on the handle, they have questioned the findings related to Meredith insisting that the level is so low it should not have been admitted as evidence in the first trial. The experts have also questioned the reliability of DNA evidence found on Meredith's bloodied bra clasp which was found at the scene and then 'missed' for six weeks. The original trial heard there were traces of Sollecito on the clasp after it was examined by forensic scientists but the experts say the fact it was left for six weeks at the scene leaves it open to contamination. Police forensic scientist Patrizia Stefanoni who led the original investigation has dismissed any suggestion of contamination and insisted she and her team followed strict guidelines. But the appeal the court was shown a video which filmed the forensic team collecting evidence with dirty gloves and using their hands instead of tweezers to collect items. Meredith, from Coulsdon, Surrey, was in Perugia as part of her Leeds University and had only been in Italy for two months before she was brutally murdered. Knox and Sollecito were jailed in December 2009. A third defendant, small-time drug dealer Rudy Guede, an immigrant from the Ivory Coast, was also jailed in connection with the brutal killing. He was handed a 30-year sentence for murder and sexual violence following a fast-track trial in October 2008 which was later cut to 16 years.","American student confident she will cleared of the murder of Briton Meredith Kercher .

"Family were kept in a filthy, single room with windows covered by planks . Jorge Iniestra Salas, a 32-year-old taxi driver, accused of raping daughters of his girlfriend, killing one girl and a three-month-old boy . By . Louise Boyle . Last updated at 10:34 AM on 9th September 2011 . A Mexican man has been arrested after he allegedly kept the teenage daughters of his girlfriend captive for five years and fathered five children with one of the girls. Jorge Iniestra Salas, a 32-year-old taxi driver, is also accused of beating one of the teenagers to death in 2009 and suffocating a three-month-old boy by forcing the baby to nurse on the dead girl's body. Prosecutors said Salas kept the bodies at his mother's home in a slum of Mexico City for a month before he dumped them on a road in a neighbouring state with the help of a brother. Prison hell: Police investigators stand by the filthy mattress in a room where Jorge Iniestra Salas held two teenage girls captive in Mexico City, fathering five children with one of them . Mexico City's prosecutor for crimes against children said that authorities rescued another three-month-old boy who had been severely beaten and is in a critical condition in hospital. The surviving sister, now 21, and her three other children, aged two, four and five, are being cared for by authorities. The family were kept in a filthy room with planks covering the windows. Prosecutor Jorge Ferman said: 'This is an imprisonment story, a story of captivity.' Police have also arrested Salas's mother, brothers and sisters and the girls' mother for covering up the abuse and not allowing them to escape. Sickening: Jorge Iniestra Salas, 32, is lead away by police after his arrest in Mexico City for allegedly sexually abusing the two daughters of his girlfriend. He is also accused of two murders . Salas allegedly became fixated on the two girls after starting a relationship with their mother Claudia Tapia, a 44-year-old school janitor, in 2004. Salas soon moved in with the family which also included a son who he forced to work and often beat with a belt for not bringing home enough money. In a chilling parallel to Austrian Josef Fritzl, prosecutors said he then stopped the girls going to school, moved them into his mother's house and refused to let them outside in the Iztapalapa neighbourhood. Tapia told reporters that Salas was manipulative and told her that he belonged to the middle-class and that men of that status could have several women living with them. The part-time cab driver has been charged with homicide, kidnapping and child abuse. He faces up to 30 years in prison. House of horror: An investigator inside the house in a Mexico City slum where Jorge Iniestra Salas is said to ahve imprisoned and abused two teenage girls for years . Squalor: The 32-year-old taxi driver is said to have become fixated with the teenage daughters of his 44-year-old girlfriend, keeping them locked up in his filthy home . The girls' mother ultimately lodged a complaint with police that led to their rescue. The attorney general's office says she was so terrorised that she gave her entire savings and her debit card to Salas. Mr Mancera said that Tapia and her daughters were suffering from Stockholm Syndrome, when captives identify with their kidnappers. They have allegedly defended Salas's behaviour during questioning by prosecutors.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 3:04 PM on 11th September 2011 . An attack on the Israeli embassy in the Egyptian capital Cairo that left three people dead and up to 1,000 injured was condemned by world leaders yesterday. A mob have broken into the embassy and dumped documents out of the windows as hundreds more demonstrated outside, prompting the ambassador and his family to leave the country. The unrest was a further worsening of already deteriorating ties between Israel and post-Hosni Mubarak Egypt. Yesterday David Cameron said he strongly condemned the attack, while the United States urged Egypt to protect the embassy. Flames: A protester holds an Egyptian national flag as a fire rages outside the building housing the Israeli embassy in Cairo . Smash: Protesters tear down a concrete wall built in front of the Israeli embassy in Cairo . Fire: Egyptian protesters burn police vehicles after clashes with police near the Israeli embassy . This was despite Egyptian police making almost no attempt to intervene with the crowds. They did fire shots into the air use tear gas, but hundreds of people tore down an embassy security wall with sledgehammers and their bare hands . Later around 30 protesters stormed into the Nile-side high-rise building where the embassy is located. Just before midnight, the group of protesters reached a room on one of the embassy's lower floors at the top of the building and began dumping Hebrew-language documents from the windows, said an Egyptian security official who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the media. In Jerusalem, an Israeli official confirmed the embassy had been broken into, saying it appeared the group reached a waiting room on the lower floor. He spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not permitted to release the information. Israel's ambassador, Yitzhak Levanon, his family and other embassy staff rushed to Cairo airport and left on a military plane for Israel, said airport officials who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the media. Israeli officials refused to comment on the ambassador's departure. No one answered the phone at the embassy late Friday. Six Israelis were trapped inside the embassy, but Egyptian commandos later stormed the building and freed them. Egypt has also put its police force on a state of alert after the rampage, which has further worsened already deteriorated ties between Israel and post-Mubarak Egypt. Israel has been growing increasingly concerned over its security as the 'Arab Spring' sparked violent protests across the Middle East. It has previously enjoyed good relations with Egypt under Hosni Mubarak, but uprisings in other Arab nations has raised the prospect of further threats to its borders. Battle: Hundreds of Egyptians stormed the building housing Israel's mission in Cairo and threw embassy documents and its national flag from windows . Anger: Protesters burn a makeshift Israeli flag in front of the embassy before the concrete wall surrounding the building was attacked . Clashes: Tear gas is fired into crowds of protesters as they stormed the embassy building in Cairo early this morning . Since the fall of Mubarak - who . worked closely with the Israelis - in February, ties have steadily . worsened between the two countries. Anger increased last month after . Israeli forces responding to a cross-border militant attack mistakenly . killed five Egyptian police officers near the border. Several large protests have taken place outside the embassy in recent months without serious incident. A senior Israeli official today denounced the attack on its embassy as a 'blow to peaceful relations'. The official said: 'That the government of Egypt ultimately acted to rescue our people is noteworthy and we are thankful. 'But what happened is a blow to the peaceful relations, and of course, a grave violation of accepted diplomatic behaviour between sovereign states.' On Friday, Egyptians held their first significant demonstrations in a month against the country's military rulers, with thousands gathering in Cairo and other cities. Alongside those gatherings, a crowd massed outside the Israeli Embassy's building. It quickly escalated with crowds pummeling the graffiti-covered security wall with sledgehammers and tearing away large sections of the cement and metal barrier, which was recently put up by Egyptian authorities to better protect the site from protests. For the second time in less than a month, protesters were able to get to the top of the building and pull down the Israeli flag. They replaced it with the Egyptian flag. Flee: Airport sources said on Saturday that Israel's envoy was set to fly out of the country . Siege: Egyptian army soldiers take their position on top of an armoured vehicle next a burning tires in front of a building housing the Israeli embassy . Crowds outside the building photographed documents that drifted to the ground and posted some of them online. Mustafa . Sayid said he was among the group of protesters who broke into the . embassy. He showed a reporter cell phone video footage he said he . recorded inside of young men ransacking the room. The . group got into the building through a third-floor window and climbed . the stairs to the embassy. They worked for hours to break through three . doors to enter the embassy, said the 28-year-old man. They encountered . three Israelis and beat one of them. Several Egyptian military policemen appeared and escorted the Israelis to safety but did not attempt to arrest any of the protesters, who then set about dumping files out the windows, he said. 'They have papers on us, they collect information on us, so it's only fair that we share information on them,' he said. It was not until several hours later that Egyptian police and military forces firing tear gas moved in to try to disperse the protesters from around the embassy. By that time, the crowds of youths had swelled to several thousand. Protesters were cleared from inside the building but held their ground outside, lobbing firebombs at the forces and setting fire to several police vehicles. Damage: A shop is engulfed in fire during the clashes with security forces this morning . Unrest: A youth hurls stones at police officers in Cairo. More than 200 people have been injured in the clashes . The military moved about 20 tanks and troop transport trucks into the area. State radio reported that one person died of a heart attack. About 450 people were injured, including 200 who had to be hospitalized, the Health Ministry said. In Washington, President Barack Obama assured Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that the U.S. was acting 'at all levels' to resolve the situation. Obama expressed 'great concern' about the situation, the White House said. Senior Israeli officials were holding discussions on the embassy breach. Israeli Defense Minster Ehud Barak said in a statement that he also spoke with his American counterpart, Leon Panetta, and appealed to him to do what he could to protect the embassy. The demonstrations against Israel coincide with increasing discontent among Egyptians with the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces, which took control of the country when Mubarak was forced out on February 11 after nearly three decades in power. Several thousand massed Friday in Cairo's Tahrir Square, as well as in the cities of Alexandria, Suez and elsewhere. Demonstrators in Cairo also converged on the state TV building, a central courthouse and the Interior Ministry, a hated symbol of abuses by police and security forces under Mubarak. Protesters covered one of the ministry's gates with graffiti and tore off parts of the large ministry seal. Seven months after the popular uprising that drove Mubarak from power, Egyptians are still pressing for a list of changes, including more transparent trials of former regime figures accused of corruption and a clear timetable for parliamentary elections. Activists accuse the council, headed by Mubarak's defense minister, Field Marshall Hussein Tantawi, of remaining too close to Mubarak's regime and practicing similarly repressive policies, including abusing detainees. The trials of thousands of civilians in military courts has also angered activists. 'In the beginning we were with the military because they claimed to be protectors of the revolution, but month after month nothing has changed,' said doctor Ghada Nimr, one of those who gathered in Tahrir Square.","Egyptian commandos storm Israeli embassy to rescue six staff trapped inside .

A toddler has become the youngest in the country to be fitted with a life-saving device after constant blood transfusions caused her veins to fail. Chloe Gray suffers from a rare blood disorder and has depended on blood transfusions her whole life, receiving her first two while still in the womb. At just 15 months old, little Chloe's veins have collapsed, exhausted by the constant and invasive procedures. Brave girl: Chloe Gray, who is 15 months old, has become the youngest in the country to be fitted with a life-saving device after constant blood transfusions caused her veins to fail . Now she has become the youngest in the UK to be fitted with a special port on her chest through which doctors will carry out future transfusions. The condition, Diamond Blackfan Anaemia, means that the tot needs blood transfusions every four weeks to stay alive. At just one day old, she underwent a full blood exchange and since then has been in and out of the Sunderland Royal Hospital with mother Francesca and father Craig. Depending on her weight, Chloe usually receives more than a third of a pint of blood, which takes up to three hours to carry out. But after 15 months of the exhausting and invasive procedures, little Chloe's veins collapsed. Francesca, 20, said: 'It doesn't get . any easier. I still can't watch them doing it because she gets that . upset. You never get used to it. 'It's a long day in hospital, but most of the time it doesn't bother Chloe, she just gets on with it. Getting on with life: Chloe, from Sunderland, suffers from rare blood disorder, Diamond Blackfan Anaemia, and has needed blood transfusions her whole life . 'It never gets better for us, though.' Thanks to the life-saving device, Francesca and Craig Bowser are hopeful that Chloe's quality of life will improve.Â  Medics carried out an operation that saw a tube fed through a cut in her neck. It was then threaded through her heart valve and fed through to the port, which is implanted in her left chest. The device makes it easier and quicker for medics to take blood and carry out the transfusions. Parents Francesca and Craig Bowser hope that by showing what their precious daughter has to go through to survive, more people will donate blood. Francesca, of Plains Farm, added: 'We want to show people what Chloe has to go through every month just to stay alive. 'It's so important that people give blood because if it wasn't for them there's no doubt about it, Chloe wouldn't be here. 'Giving blood is literally life-changing and is the difference between Chloe being here and not being here. 'She's had to have blood since before she was even born and we were told when I was pregnant at 20 weeks that she wouldn't survive more than ten hours and if it wasn't for people giving blood, she would have died. 'To live, Chloe has no other option than to have blood transfusions.'

"By . Claire Bates . Last updated at 1:52 AM on 10th September 2011 . About one in 100 people in the UK suffer from neuropathic pain . For those of us who are martyrs to our backs, help could be at hand â in a few years' time, anyway. Scientists claim to have identified the gene behind back pain, in a development that could lead to effective treatment within a decade. Experts at Cambridge University said their research into the HCN2 gene could provide relief to millions. About one in seven Britons suffers from so-called chronic back pain, which can also include arthritis and headaches. This chronic pain comes in two main varieties. Inflammatory ailments occur when a persistent injury results in very sensitive nerve endings, which increases the sensation of pain. The other kind â neuropathic â is felt when nerves are damaged, causing ongoing, and often permanent, pain. This is often seen in patients with diabetes and shingles and in the aftermath of cancer chemotherapy â as well as in cases of back pain. When researchers removed the HCN2 gene from pain-sensitive nerves in mice, they put a stop to their neuropathic pain. However, the mice were still able to feel acute pain, which occurs suddenly, such as when biting one's tongue. Professor Peter McNaughton, lead author of the study and head of Cambridge's department of pharmacology, said a drug based on his team's research could be available within a decade. 'Individuals suffering from neuropathic pain often have little or no respite because of the lack of effective medications,' he said. 'Our research lays the groundwork for the development of new drugs to treat chronic pain by blocking HCN2.' Chronic: One in seven Britons suffer from back pain which can also include headaches . Gene clue: The HCN2 gene could provide relief to millions . Professor McNaughton told the journal Science: 'Many genes play a critical role in pain sensation, but in most cases interfering with them simply abolishes all pain, or even all sensation. 'What is exciting about the work on the HCN2 gene is that removing it â or blocking it pharmacologically â eliminates neuropathic pain without affecting normal acute pain. 'This finding could be very valuable clinically because normal pain sensation is essential for avoiding accidental damage.'","Pain costs health providers Â£176billion a year in Europe and Â£94billion in the U.S .

The difference in rates was due to a higher initial risk and later detection, according to a U.S. government study. The National Cancer Institute study found the highest male-to-female mortality rate ratios were for mouth, larynx and hypopharynx cancers. Hospital: Men diagnosed with cancer and more likely to die from the disease than women - due to a higher initial risk and later detection, an official study said . The study looked at a database of 36 different types of cancer from 1977 to 2006. More than 5.5 men died from mouth cancer for every woman, 5.4 from cancer of the larynx and 4.5 for hypopharynx cancer, reported AFP. For lung cancer, which is the leading cause of cancer deaths for both men and women, the research found 2.3 male deaths for each female death. The main reason for the difference is that men are more at risk of developing cancer to begin with, the study's lead investigator said. Michael Cook is an investigator in the division of cancer epidemiology and genetics at the National Cancer Institute. The . average lifetime chance a man will develop lung cancer is about one in . 13, or one in 16 for a woman, the American Cancer Society says. American men are more likely than women to have advanced disease by the time their cancer is diagnosed, Mr Cook said. Waiting line: More than 5.5 men died from mouth cancer for every woman, 5.4 from cancer of the larynx and 4.5 for hypopharynx cancer, the study showed . He . said gender differences in exposure to carcinogens - including tobacco . smoke and viral infections - play a role in the rate disparity. âUniversalâ mechanisms, such as sex chromosomes and hormones, were cited and may contribute to observed sex differences in cancer incidence. The NCI researchers said there was no single root cause for the disparity. But influences include differences in behaviour of the tumour, cancer screening for people without symptoms and presence of other illnesses. A recent survey conducted by Abbott Laboratories found that 28 per cent of men do not visit the doctor regularly.","Difference due to higher initial risk and later detection .

There were reports of muggings and vandalism at the party at Clifton Mansions, a block of 22 council-owned flats on Coldharbour Lane. A man dives at police this morning as they arrive to evict squatters in the building in Brixton, south London . Hundreds of revellers last night turned up to a party at Clifton Mansions on Coldharbour Lane, which was finally brought to a close at 9am this morning when police stepped in to evict residents . The flats once housed alternative musicians and artists, such as members of Irish punk-folk band The Pogues and Turner Prize-winning artist Jeremy Deller.

In an unprecedented attack by a former prime minister on a leading business, Mr Brown claimed Rupert Murdochâs media group has âlinks with the criminal underworldâ and accused it of using âdisgustingâ methods to gain access to personal information. He said he and wife Sarah had been left âin tearsâ when Rebekah Brooks, then editor of The Sun, contacted them to tell them she was going to publish a story about his son Fraserâs diagnosis with cystic fibrosis. War of words: Gordon Brown is locked in a battle with News International after an unprecedented attack on the company in a television interview . However, The Sun last night claimed that . there had been no wrong-doing and that the story came to them through a . good old-fashioned method - a tip-off from a member of the public. Mr Brown also claimed his bank accounts and legal files had been accessed by investigators working for the Sunday Times. The former Prime Minister said: âNews International were using people who were known criminals,â he said. âPeople who had in some cases criminal records, and... News International as a result were working through links that they had with the criminal underworld.â But News International hit back last night, categorically denying allegations that The Sun had accessed medical records. It also claimed Mr Brown and his wife Sarah gave senior staff at the paper consent to publish the November 2006 article. A spokesman for the firm said: âWe are able to assure the Brown family that we did not access the medical records of their son, nor did we commission anyone to do so. News Corporation Chairman and CEO Rupert Murdoch photographed with his wife Wendi and Prime Minister Gordon Brown and wife Sarah - just months after the story about the Browns' son Fraser's condition was printed in The Sun . 'On receipt of the information, The Sun approached Mr Brown and discussed with his colleagues how best to present it. 'Those colleagues provided quotes which were used in the published piece which indicated his consent to it. 'We continue to inquire into other allegations made by Mr Brown.' In an article published today in The Sun, the unnamed member of the public said he contacted reporters with information about Fraser's cystic fibrosis in an attempt to raise awareness about the condition. He said: 'I felt vindicated in contacting The Sun. I just felt at the time that we could have made something positive out of the tragedy and I believe the truth would have come out eventually anyway. Cosying up with the Murdochs: Brown shakes Elisabeth's hand inside No 10 in March 2008. Rebekah Brooks, right, who was then editor of The Sun watches on . 'It is tragic for the Browns like . many other people throughout the years who have children diagnosed. But . the fact that they are so high profile could have made a difference.' The father, who is said to have links . with the Brown family, learned about Fraser's condition just weeks . after he was born, the paper said. However, he did not immediately pass on the news because he expected it to be widely reported. 'I was very surprised it didn't come . out before it did,"" he added. 'I did it with the best of intentions and I . totally stand by that decision. 'I have no regrets. I just wanted to . highlight this. It's happened to many people and it's just sad that it's . happening to another family. A very high profile family.' The source also said he did not have access to the Brown family medical records. 'I have not had access to the medical records of the child at any time,' he said. The Sunday Times also denied Mr Brownâs claims, insisting it had investigated a story about his purchase of a flat, which it published in January 2000, in the public interest. âWe were told that Mr Brown had bought a flat cheaper than any normal valuation and that he obtained it through a company in which Geoffrey Robinson, a close ally, had been a director,â the newspaper said in a statement. A convicted conman, Barry Beardall, is said to have been commissioned by the paper to âblagâ information on the apartment. But the statement said: âWe had reasonable grounds to investigate this matter and followed the PCC Code on using subterfuge. âWe believe no law was broken in the process of this investigation, and contrary to Mr Brownâs assertion, no criminal was used.â",Red-top claims story about Brown's son having cystic fibrosis was handed to it by a 'member of the public'
"GCHQ 'losing web security experts' because they can't match Google's high salaries . By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 2:11 PM on 13th July 2011 . Al Qaeda has explicitly called for âcyber-jihadâ and there have been a series of attempts by terrorists to âinvadeâ Facebook, the Government's new counter-terrorism strategy said today. Terrorists are increasingly using online technology to plan and disguise attacks and there will be more cyber-terrorism in the future, it said. âSince the death of Osama bin Laden, Al Qaeda has explicitly called not only for acts of lone or individual terrorism, but also for 'cyber-jihad',â it added. Home Secretary Theresa May launched the new counter-terrorism strategy which warned that since the death of Osama bin Laden Al . Qaeda had called for 'cyber-jihad' The use of social networking sites and video sharing is now âcommonplaceâ, the strategy said. âThere have been a number of attempts by terrorist and extremist groups to ""invade"" Facebook. âTwitter will be used to re-post media or forum articles enabling extremist content to be shared more quickly, widely and amongst people who would not normally search for extremist content.â And experts have estimated that there are already thousands of terrorist-related websites, adding: 'A few dozen are highly influential and frequented by terrorists.' The strategy comes the day after the UK threat level from international terrorism was downgraded from severe to substantial, meaning there is still a âstrong possibilityâ of an attack and one may well happen without further warning'. Warning: 'There have been a number of attempts by terrorist and extremist groups to ""invade"" Facebook,' said the Government's new counter-terrorism strategy (File picture) Crimes linked to Facebook reached more than 100,000 across the country in the last five years, according to a report out in December. Callers . have alerted officers to alleged acts of terrorism, sudden deaths, . missing pets, sexual offences, hate crimes and even firearms offences. Police . chiefs in 16 forces received 7,545 calls from the public last year, . compared to just 1,411 calls related to Facebook to police in 2005. The website launched in February 2004 and now has over 750million active users. The . government is to launch another cyber strategy later this year, funded . by part of the Â£650million put aside for cyber-security under their . strategic defence and security review last October. Launching the Government's counter-terrorism strategy, Home Secretary Theresa May said: âAdvances in technology mean our response must improve to keep pace. âTerrorists are increasingly using online technology, including Google Earth and Street View, for attack planning.â She went on: âThe marauding attacks in Mumbai in 2008 were directed by people using off-the-shelf secure communications technology to stay in contact with each other. âSoftware to encrypt mobile phone voice and text functions is widely available and improving. âPeer-to-peer networks can be used to distribute files and information rapidly and securely. âAnd cloud computing offers new means for storing, sharing and distributing material online. âIt can be encrypted and configured to work with mobile devices, leaving little or no trace of the data behind. âAnd while radicalisation continues primarily to be a social process, terrorists are making more and more use of new technologies to communicate their propaganda.â Mrs May added: âTo tackle these new and emerging threats, our own technology must constantly evolve and adapt.â Britain's top secret electronic spy agency - is struggling to retain key cyber security specialists because it cannot match the wages offered by firms such as Microsoft and Google, it was disclosed today. The parliamentary Intelligence and Security Committee (ISC) said it was 'concerned' GCHQ was unable to retain a 'suitable cadre of internet specialists' to deal with the growing threat of cyber warfare. In its annual report, the committee - made up of senior MPs and peers - also rebuked GCHQ for losing track of equipment worth up to Â£1 million over the past 10 years. While it said that the majority of items attracted no security risk, GCHQ had admitted that in 5 per cent of cases - covering around 450 items - it could not guarantee that this was the case. 'Although the committee has no reason to believe national security has been compromised, the agencies must do all they can to avoid the loss of potentially sensitive equipment,' the report said. 'The public interest requires that GCHQ learns from the repeated mistakes of the past.' The report disclosed that in evidence to the committee, the GCHQ director Iain Lobban said he was struggling to recruit and retain the 'real internet whizzes' he needed to counter the growing threat of cyber warfare. 'They will be working for Microsoft or Google or Amazon or whoever. And I can't compete with their salaries,' he said. 'Month-on-month, we are losing whizzes who'll basically say 'I'm sorry, I am going to take three times the salary and the car and whatever else'.' Overall the committee expressed concern that the 11.3 per cent budget cut for the intelligence agencies - including MI5 and MI6 as well as GCHQ - imposed in the comprehensive spending review would affect their ability to 'maintain current levels of coverage of all aspects of the threat'. It warned that the situation could worsen if inflation remained at current levels and said it was 'essential' that the spending review settlement could be reopened if there was a 'significant change in the threat'. The ISC said that MI5, the Security Service, had given assurances it was able to respond to the increased terrorist threat in Northern Ireland, but the committee warned that in the context of declining resources, it would 'affect the service's capability in other areas, which is a matter of concern'. At the same time, the committee warned that the 2012 London Olympics would 'inevitably' lead to resources being diverted from MI5's other work during that period and 'thus expose the UK to greater risk'.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 4:02 PM on 13th July 2011 . Osama bin Laden had no plans for terrorist attacks at the time of his death, according to new evidence. The last Al Qaeda attack he was involved in planning was the 7/7 bombings in London in 2005 where he was in close contact with other terrorists. Although bin Laden remained a figure head for extremists, he had little involvement during his final years holed up in a compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan. Fixated: Osama Bin Laden watches himself on TV at his compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan . Information found at the hide-out, where the Al Qaeda chief was killed on May 2 by U.S. troops, suggested that bin Laden also had advance knowledge of several plots that failed. This included a London-based plan in 2006 to blow up transatlantic flights using home-made liquid explosives. The plot was disrupted when British . authorities launched a major round-up of suspects. Flights to and from . Britain were severely disrupted and tight new restrictions were placed . on passenger carry-on items such as liquids and gels. Al Qaeda also attempted to target the New York subway in 2009 and unspecified targets in Europe last year. Last moments: The bedroom at the mansion in Pakistan where bin Laden was killed after ten years in hiding . The quiet extremist: A Pakistani shepherd herds his goats past the hideout of Al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden, who was killed by U.S. Special Forces in May . One official said: 'Bin Laden was . absolutely a detail guy. We have every reason to believe that he was . aware of Al Qaeda's major plots during the planning phase, including the . airline plot in 2006 and the London 7/7 attacks.' Although . there is no 'smoking gun' evidence to prove he masterminded the London . bombings, there is strong evidence that he was in close contact with . other Al Qaeda militants as they planned the attacks. Another official source said that bin Laden was 'immersed in operational details of the group's activities. We believe he was aware of these plots ahead of time'. Feared: Osama bin Laden was behind the 9/11 attacks on the U.S. and 7/7 London bombings . A total of 56 people, including four . suicide bombers, died in the attacks on three London Tube trains and a . double-decker bus on July 7, 2005. Hundreds more were injured in the . planned bombings. 'It was the last successful operation Osama bin Laden oversaw,' a sourceÂ  said. Although British-led investigations had established Al Qaeda's role in 7/7, bin Laden had not been personally . linked to the bombings until recently. No evidence was found at the Pakistan . compound to suggest that bin Laden was involved in planning further . attacks directed at Western targets. Destruction: It has been confirmed that bin Laden was involved in planning the 7/7 attacks on London in 2005 . Videos released after bin Laden's death showed him as a vain man, obsessed with his own image and how he was portrayed to the world - even from the confines of the Pakistan compound. One of the films released by U.S. security forces, shows Bin Laden, his unkempt beard streaked with grey, sitting on the floor, wrapped in a brown blanket and holding a remote control. He flipped back and forth between what appears to be live news coverage of himself. The old, small television was perched on top of a desk with a large tangle of electrical wires running to a nearby control box. The CIA discovered that a satellite dish provided a television feed to bin Laden's suburban compound. The video also revealed that Bin Laden had a computer in his home, though officials say there were no Internet or phone lines running from the house.","Former Al Qaeda boss had advance knowledge of Tube and bus bomb plot .

'Darien Lake violated their own policies and procedures by letting him get on the ride,' Maha said. A promotional photograph taken automatically shows Hackemer's college-age nephew, Ashton Luffred, looking straight ahead in the moments after the accident, his face without expression and his hands on the safety bar in front of him. Authorities aren't releasing the photo. Victim: Sgt James Hackemer during a physical therapy session after he was injured in Iraq . Tragic: Seargent James Hackemer died after falling from the Ride of Steel in Syracuse . Maha said Luffred was in a state of shock after the accident but told police Hackemer didn't say anything to indicate he was worried about falling off the ride. Maha said park operators clearly violated policy by letting Hackemer on the ride but won't face criminal charges. Civil liability could be determined later if a lawsuit is filed, he said. Hackemer's relatives have said they do not hold the theme park responsible. So glad he's home: James' proud mother Nancy pictured on his return from Iraq in 2008 . Closed: The Ride of Steel rollercoaster at Darien Lake Theme Park Resort where Sgt. Hackemer was thrown off . Maha said the state labor department is still investigating the mechanics and safety of the ride but have indicated to him that the coaster was operating correctly. Hackemer was missing all of his left leg and most of his right leg and was not wearing prosthetic limbs when he was thrown from the ride. The 29-year-old father of two had lost both his legs to a roadside bomb in Iraq in 2008 and was on a family outing when the accident happened. A funeral service for Hackemer is planned for Thursday in his hometown of Gowanda. He will be buried at Arlington National Cemetery. The car pulled into the loading station with the lap bar and seatbelt still in place, Maha said. The ride is still closed pending the state labor department probe.",Park will not be prosecuted despite 'violating' own rules .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 9:04 AM on 13th September 2011 . A drunken housewife hit her husband over the head with a 7ft mirror before he retaliated by attacking her with a stun gun, a court heard yesterday. The couple were watching television and eating a Chinese takeaway following a night out when Terri Smith, 43, became overwhelmed with emotion over their âvolatileâ 13-year marriage and launched the astonishing attack. She accused husband Antony Smith, 42,Â of responding by blasting her five times in the stomach with the illegal 50,000 volt âblack cobraâ taser gun. In court: Terri Smith and her husband Antony Smith outside Chippenham Magistrates Court. She has accused him of attacking her with a stun gun . âI was jabbed three, four, five times in my stomach, it was a sharp stabbing pain,â she told Chippenham magistrates. âI heard the clicky sound of the gun three or four times.â Mrs Smith claimed her husband, a roof tiler, then dragged her through the front door âvery hard by my hairâ and shut the door. âI threw something at the door which smashed the glass and I cut my hand,â she said. Mr Smith allegedly then hurled his wifeâs handbag outside and was said to have kicked her in the face as she picked up the contents. But magistrates cleared Mr Smith of the attack. He admitted possessing an illegal taser, but denied a charge of assault by beating and insisted he had not fired the weapon during the incident because âthere wasnât enough charge in itâ. Presiding magistrate Roger Coleman said: âWe find that the defendant did act in self-defence, we believe his version of events. 'The defendantâs actions were reasonable in the circumstances.â Mr Smith will be sentenced next month for possession of the illegal stun gun. Although Mrs Smith was arrested, she faced no charges over the incident at the coupleâs home in Swindon, Wiltshire, in February. She said: âI donât know what came over me, I got up and flipped the coffee table over in front of us. I had so many mixed emotions. âI was angry about a lot of things, I was sad, I was living under pressure all the time.

Director Madonna attends the gala screening for her latest film 'W.E.' during the Toronto International Film Festival last night . A stalker who broke into Madonnaâs bedroom in London raided Guy Ritchieâs Wiltshire mansion and dressed up in his clothes the year before. Grzegorz Matlok used a rope to clamber on to a balcony and smash his way into the singerâs Â£10million townhouse and rifle through her bedding earlier this year. Yesterday, during a hearing at Southwark Crown Court, it emerged the 30-year-old, . from Poland, had, last June, sneaked into the country estate Madonna . used to share with ex-husband Ritchie and was caught putting on his . clothes and trying to set other items alight. He was arrested but not charged in the incident, according to reports. Matlok was later deported to Poland for . mental health treatment, but on March 12 this year flew back to . Britain intent on seeing the star. Matlok believed he was in an intimate . relationship with the Material Girl, having exchanged âspecial messagesâ with her, Southwark Crown court heard yesterday. Armed . with a map showing the location of her home, Matlok smashed his way in . through a window in the early hours after using a rope to climb the wall . of one of her adjoining town houses. Despite . a security guard being called to the disturbance, Matlok . hid in a cupboard, before roaming through her home. The only thing the intruder took was a can of Red Bull worth Â£2.40 from her garage. He was caught by Madonnaâs close friend, film director Nathan Rissman, 39, who was renting the adjoining home . Mr Rissman alerted security guards . who wrestled Matlok to the floor. Madonna, 52, and her children were all . in America at the time. When police arrived they found a trail of Matlokâs personal items in her house.

"By . Laurie Whitwell . Last updated at 5:34 PM on 12th September 2011 . A Florida driver is suing the state for wrongly issuing thousands of tickets to people who flashed their lights to warn other motorists of speed traps. Erich Campbell says the act is not illegal and has filed a lawsuit on behalf of every driver fined for the violation over the past six years, accusing police of misinterpreting state law and violating motoristsâ free speech rights. 'I don't like what the government is doing, especially now when most people have a hard time affording gas,' the 38-year-old told WTSP.com. 'And now they have to defend themselves against a made up charge that doesn't exist.' Class action: Erich Campbell is suing the state of Florida on behalf of 2,500 drivers wrongly issued with tickets for flashing their lights . Mr Campbell, of Land O'Lakes, was driving the Veterans Expressway in Tampa two years ago when he noticed two black Florida Highway Patrol cruisers in the median, with their lights off. He did what he always does and flashed his lights to oncoming motorists to warn them of the impending speed trap. The officers did not take kindly though, and within 60 seconds they had pulled him over and were in the process of issuing him a ticket for $115 for improper flashing of high beams . Mr Campbell says the FHP trooper told him what he had done was illegal. 'You could tell in his voice he was upset,' Mr Campbell told WSTP.com. 'He was professional, he wasn't rude, but you could tell he was irritated.' Mr Campbell later learned that flashing lights is not an offence, though, and had his ticket dismissed by Hillsborough County Judge Raul Palomino. Ticket: Mr Campbell says motorists are being unlawfully punished by frustrated police officers who feel they were disrespected . Angered for others affected, Mr Campbell hired attorney J. Marc Jones of Oviedo, and filed a class action suit which says 'Florida Statue 316.2397' â under which Mr Campbell was cited â 'does not prohibit the flashing of headlights as a means of communications, nor does it in any way reference flashing headlights or the use of high beams.' Mr Campbell says police are misinterpreting a law which is meant to ban drivers from having strobe lights in their cars or official-looking blue police lights. The lawsuit states the FHP is fully aware they are wrongfully applying the state law and they are doing it as a means of generating revenue. In 2005, a court order was even issued saying the state law does not prohibit the flashing of vehicle headlights. Mr Campbell's lawsuit, filed in circuit court in Tallahassee, cites similar cases in Escambia, Osceola, Seminole and St. Lucie counties in which tickets for flashing were all dismissed by judges. Specifically, he discovered online the story of Alexis Cason, 22, of suburban Orlando, who received a a ticket in 2005 before winning a similar case in court. See the light: The suit says police are misinterpreting a law that's meant to ban drivers from having strobe lights in their cars or official-looking blue police lights . Litigation: Some estimates put the cost to the state if it loses as high as $150million, because the suit is seeking $15,000 in damages for each driver . 'In each of these examples,' the lawsuit claims, 'Florida courts properly found that (the law) does not prohibit the flashing of headlights as a means of communication,' which the suit calls 'a right of free speech.' 'This is a pattern, and it has mostly to do with frustrated police officers who feel they were disrespected,' Mr Campbell told the St Petersburg Times. 'When someone comes along and rats them out, they take offense to it.' Captain Mark Welch, a spokesman for the FHP, cited to the St Petersburg Times a law that says 'flashing lights are prohibited on vehicles' except for turn signals. But soon after Mr Campbell launched his case against the state, the Highway Patrol ordered all troopers to stop issuing tickets to motorists who use headlights as a signal to other drivers. 'You are directed to suspend enforcement action for this type of driver behavior,' said the August 29 memo from Grady Garrick, acting deputy director of patrol operations. The lawsuit estimates that 2,400 motorists in Florida were cited for headlight-flashing between 2005 and 2010. It asks a circuit judge to certify the case as a class action on behalf of those other motorists, which means that if the state loses, it could be forced to return a substantial amount of money. Some estimates put the cost as high as $150million, because the suit is seeking a refund of the $115 ticket plus $15,000 in damages for each driver. The state has not formally answered the lawsuit yet. 'For me, this has to do more with the principle than the cost,' Mr Campbell said, adding that the state is not being honest when it says it does not write tickets to increase revenue, but rather to get people to slow down. If that were true, Mr Campbell told WSTP.com, the FHP should be delighted with him, because drivers did decelerate before troopers could give them a ticket.","Erich Campbell says there is no law to prohibit light flashing .

Two people are being questioned by police after one of the most highly-rated high school basketball players in the U.S. was been fatally shot in the head inside her housing block. Tayshana âChickenâ Murphy, 18, was found dead by her mother in their Harlem building in Harlem early on Sunday morning. The top basketball prospect was a senior at Murry Bergtraum High School in Manhattan and was due to become captain of her team this year. Tragedy: Tayshana 'Chicken' Murphy, 18, was found dead by her mother in their Harlem building in Manhattan, New York, early Sunday morning . Ms Murphy lived on the 15th floor of her building but was shot in the head execution style at 4:14am in a fourth-floor hallway, according to police . But solid details surrounding the tragic shooting are otherwise scarce, as no suspects have been named and police are reviewing surveillance tape. A source told the New York Post that two people who may have information about the case are being grilled by police. Ms Murphy and her friends reportedly got into an argument with thugs and she was chased into her building when neighbours became rowdy. A fight broke out and witnesses believe she may have been mistaken for a boy as she was wearing a hoodie. Tephanie Holston said her daughter came up to her flat 45 minutes before the shooting to get a sweatshirt and use the bathroom. Basketball memorial: Her mother Tephanie Holston said she was in high demand from top local colleges after a promising career through high school . When Ms Holston heard gunfire she took the lift downstairs and then ran up the building before tragically finding her daughter herself. âI held her in my hands. She looked like she was sleeping.

Two disgraced peers who fiddled their expenses have been released early from prison after serving only a quarter of their sentences. Lord Taylor was jailed for a year in May for fraudulently claiming more than Â£11,000 in taxpayersâ money, while Lord Hanningfield received a nine-month sentence in July after falsely claiming Â£13,000. Both men were expelled from the Conservative Party but they remain members of the House of Lords â enabling them to start claiming more expenses. It is understood they were both . released last week on home detention curfews. This means they are seen . as low risk but must wear an electronic tag. Lord Hanningfield, 70, was pictured at . his home in West Hanningfield, Essex, over the weekend looking relaxed . and refused to admit any wrong-doing. LordÂ  Taylor, meanwhile, was seen . visiting a beauty salon near his home in Ealing, west London. Lord Taylor, who became the first black Conservative peer in 1996, was found to have lied under oath during his fraud trial. The 58-year-old told the House of . Lords membersâ expenses office that his main residence was a house in . Oxford. In fact, he only twice visited the property. He was therefore not entitled to claim . money for travelling from there to London and staying overnight in the . capital. Lord Taylor is seen out and about in London on Tuesday . Lord Hanningfield, a former pig farmer, served as a Lords . opposition frontbencher and leader of Essex County Council. He falsely claimed Â£13,379 for overnight stays in London. He lost his seat at Essex County . Council as a result and is being investigated for alleged misuse of his . corporate credit card by the Kent and Essex Serious Crime Directorate. Claims: Lord .

"By . Mark Duell and Laurie Whitwell . Last updated at 8:39 AM on 12th September 2011 . Rick Perry has risked fanning the flames of criticism for his handling of the Texas wildfires by failing to show for a pre-arranged press conference. The Texas governor and Republican presidential nominee was scheduled to be in Bastrop on Saturday to see and talk about the latest on the huge blazes, which have torched 1,600 homes and killed four people. But he didn't turn up. No show: Texas Governor Rick Perry, pictured today during a memorial service at the Texas State Cemetery Twin Towers Monument in Austin, has drawn ire for failing to show for a press conference on Saturday . Mr Perry's office had sent out two advisories about his media availability. The second one gave a new location for the event because the first one would have had limited access. However, when the cameras started rolling at the second, confirmed location, which was a burned-out home and chocolate shop along the main highway, Mr Perry was not there. Local officials briefed the media on the fire situation in his absence. Aides to the presidential candidate cited 'logistical issues', explaining that the change of location made it impossible for Mr Perry to get there in time. 'We didn't want to hold y'all up,' staffer Allison Castle told the Houston Chronicle. 'Our intention was for him to be here.' Another Perry spokeswoman, Catherine Frazier, told the Texas Tribune: 'By the time we nailed down a second location we wouldnât be able to get the governor there in time without making everybody wait.' Burnout: A truck destroyed by the massive Bastrop wildfire, is seen in Bastrop, Texas, on Saturday . Not moving: A motorcycle destroyed by the Bastrop wildfire is seen in Bastrop, Texas, on Saturday . Instead, Mr Perry stayed in Austin . and did not travel to Bastrop at all. Staffers could not say exactly why . he was unable to make the 45-minute journey. His office added that officials at that press conference 'reiterated the same message that the governor would have delivered.' Mr . Perry, who has already come in for stick due to time spent on the . campaign trail while there were fires burning in his state, was today at . a memorial service at the Texas State Cemetery Twin Towers Monument in . Austin. Texas officials . say the number of homes destroyed by the massive wildfire raging east . of Austin has risen to 1,554. They also say 17 people are unaccounted . for. Bastrop County . Sheriff Terry Pickering said today that the missing people could simply . be out of town, but authorities have been unable to contact them. Ablaze: A helicopter carries in water to be dropped near Jefferson, Texas, in an attempt to halt the wildfires . Hazy sky: A plane carries in vital fire retardant to be dropped near Jefferson, Texas, earlier this week . County . emergency management director Mike Fisher says the number of homes . destroyed is expected to rise further as officials enter more areas . where the fire has been extinguished. The . blaze in Bastrop erupted a week ago when blustering winds whipped up by . Tropical Storm Lee blew over parched, drought-stricken Texas. The fire . is the largest of more than 190 raging throughout the state. Yesterday, . tensions flared at a news conference when residents shouted at county . officials and demanded to know when they could return to their homes - . or find out what remains of them. 'This is day seven, tensions are . high' Bastrop County Judge Ronnie McDonald . Fire . crews are making progress fighting the wildfire but concerns over . smouldering hotspots have kept thousands of residents from returning . home in the Bastrop area, 30 miles east of Austin. At the conference yesterday, Bastrop . County Judge Ronnie McDonald said officials hope to get people back as . soon as possible, but he is not sure how long that will take. âThis is . day seven, tensions are high,â he said. After . spending nearly a week wondering whether his home had been destroyed in . the wildfires, George Gaydos got the news on Saturday that it had . indeed burned down. Frazzled: A Dr Pepper can that melted during the Bastrop wildfire is seen in the Texas area on Saturday . Notice: A sign warning motorists not to start fires is seen in wildfire-hit Bastrop, Texas, on Saturday . But Mr . Gaydos - who has been living at a hotel with his wife, two children and . father since fleeing the fires nearly a week ago - still cannot return . to his neighbourhood to see what is left of his house. A . perilous mix of hot temperatures, strong winds and a historic drought . spawned the Bastrop-area fire - the largest of the nearly 190 wildfires . the state forest service says have erupted this week. A 22,000-acre blaze straddling three . rural counties about 40miles northwest of Houston has burned for several . days, destroying about 60 homes and forcing some people to evacuate. 'Everybody hang in there and we'll get you back home as soon as possible' Bastrop County Sheriff Terry Pickering . About half the fire was behind . containment lines and no towns or cities were threatened. Most homes in . the area are scattered in the forest, ranch-land and in small . subdivision clusters. In Bastrop, officials said the fire was about 50 per cent contained after almost a week of burning. Though . residents were anxious to get to their neighbourhoods, Bastrop County . Sheriff Terry Pickering said authorities need to be certain they are . safe before residents would be allowed back. Working: A fire fighting crew from the Lassen National Forest in California clean up hot spots after the destructive wildfire in Bastrop, Texas, on Saturday . Doing their bit: The Lassen National Forest crew help fight the massive Texas wildfire but concerns about hotspots are keeping thousands of residents in the Bastrop area from returning home . Residents . from one 700-acre area that includes about two dozen homes were allowed . to return home, but other areas remained evacuated as crews tried to . put out potentially dangerous hotspots. âEverybody hang in there and we'll get you back home as soon as possible,â Mr Pickering said. 'We haven't even hit our toughest area'Bastrop County Judge Ronnie McDonald . Fire crews continued battling hot spots on Saturday, but didn't expect major wind gusts overnight. However authorities also cautioned that the toll from the fires could get worse. Judge . McDonald said he expected the number of homes destroyed by the fire to . increase from the current tally as more assessments are completed. A spokesman for the team of state, local and federal agencies also said it is expected to rise. âWe haven't even hit our toughest area,â Judge McDonald said on Saturday afternoon. He added that teams haven't had a . chance to go in and âcount those houses or get a tally because of the . amount of heat that's in the areaâ. Big effort: Tommy Ratto, a firefighter from the Lassen National Forest team, cleans up a hot spot after the destructive wildfire in Bastrop, Texas, on Saturday . Smoking: A Lake Worth fire unit sprays an area where the fire had jumped Shelby Road in Rendon, Texas, as brush fires occupied numerous fire departments on Friday . In the meantime, residents are . staying wherever they can - makeshift shelters at churches, friends' and . relatives' homes, even cars in nearby parking lots. âThere are some who are actually . picking out apartments,â said Sean McGahan, pastor of New Beginnings . Church in Bastrop. âIf you haven't already started, you're probably . behind the curve.â Next week, Mr Gaydos and his family will move into a mobile home in Bastrop while they decide whether to rebuild. Before . finding out Saturday on a fire department website that his home had . been destroyed, Mr Gaydos spent much of the past week so worried about . his home that he couldn't sleep. âYou wake up in the middle of the night and you can't go back to sleep,â Mr Gaydos said. âI've been going to work early just because I'm already up.â âThere are some who are actually picking . out apartments.

"By . Emily Sheridan and Sarah Bull . Last updated at 8:18 AM on 13th September 2011 . David Walliams finally reached Westminster this evening after an epic 140-mile swim of the Thames. The Little Britain star, 40, was greeted by his wife Lara Stone, celebrity friends, relatives and hundreds of fans as he climbed up the steps in front of the former County Hall building on the South Bank. Exhausted and achy, the comedian said he was 'OK, a bit tired' after his challenging journey over the past eight days. Triumphant: David Walliams celebrates swimming 140 miles of the River Thames as he arrives on the South Bank at Westminster . The comedian was met by friends Barbara Windsor, Miranda Hart and Lenny Henry as he heard he had raised more than Â£1.1million for Sport Relief. Talking to The One Show about 45 minutes after his ascent from the river, he said: 'I feel incredible relief. I'm a bit over swimming... I feel like I've done enough for a lifetime.' Amid widespread congratulations from everyone around him, Walliams played down his achievement: 'It was just swimming. It was just putting one arm in front of the other... just swimming.' Although incredibly shattered following his epic journey, no doubt the adrenaline had kicked in giving Walliams the energy to celebrate as he was showered with ticker tape. Just a few more strokes... Walliams just metres away from the finish line . I'm a celebrity... get me out of here! The exhausted comedian is helped out of the water on the steps at the former County Hall . All I want is a shandy and my bed: Walliams said he would have a quiet celebration sleeping after his epic journey . Despite battling a . bout of 'Thames Tummy', a painful rash where his wetsuit rubbed and . aching muscles, Walliams hasn't let anything stop him completing the . challenge, which saw him swimming over 110,000 strokes. Reflecting on his journey, he said: . 'There was a lot against me at the beginning and the water was a lot . colder because the summer was so bad. 'Being sick was a low point. I lost my mojo but I thought if I try I can keep going. 'You are alone with your thoughts for a really long time. Some days I was in the water for 10-12 hours so you sometimes have delusional thoughts so you try to think of songs that you love or movies that you love.' 'Proud to be British': Walliams paid tribute to all those who had supported him along the way, including sponsors and spectators . Back in Lara's arms: Walliams managed to sum up the energy to hug his stunning wife . Proud wife: Lara looked like she couldn't be happier to have her husband back on dry land and the pair couldn't stop smiling . As he prepared to head home for a nice warm bath, he jokingly asked his friend Windsor to sponge him down. He said: 'Dame Barbara, will you bath me? I love this lady!' He paid tribute to those who supported him along the way: 'What took me by surprise was the support. It made me really proud to be British. It's tough times and people have been so generous with their time and money.' Among those congratulating him on . Twitter was James Corden: 'I'm so inspired by David Walliams #thamesswim . That next year I am going to try and swim a width of the Thames. Wish . me luck!' That's my friend! Barbara Windsor was one of the first people to greet Walliams when he got out of the river . Celebrity support: Lenny Henry (centre left) and Barbara Windsor (2nd right) were ready to greet him . Chris Moyles, who . interviewed Walliams this morning, wrote: 'He did it!!!! Well done . David Walliams and @sportrelief amazing achievement and a tonne of money . raised for good causes. Respect.' The tide helped the Little Britain star speed along the last 11 miles after a rest at Kew earlier today as he waited for a break in the tide. This morning, Walliams tackled the . toughest stretch of the Thames when it becomes tidal, with strong . currents and undertows and busy river traffic. A . Twitter update on the Sport Relief page this morning explained: 'Day 8 . of the #thamesswim is about to begin. Tidal Thames looking mildly . irritated rather than full on angry - wet windy morning though.' So relieved! Walliams declared he was 'a bit over swimming' after his amazing feat . Supporters: Hundreds of people were waiting on the South Bank of the Thames to cheer on the comedian at the finish line . Walliams has been supported by his Dutch model wife Stone, who travelled in a support boat, and was met along the way by . celebrity friends including comics Jimmy Carr, Miranda Hart and Rob . Brydon. He said yesterday: 'The two things that have really kept me . going so far are the updates of the fundraising totals I'm given and the . stunning support I've been given by the public. 'There must have been . tens of thousands of people along the route and I can hear their cheers . as I'm swimming. 'I . never expected this to catch the public's imagination like it has - . there seems to have been a real carnival atmosphere around it which is . lovely.' Challenging journey: Walliams swam 140 miles from Lechdale in Gloucestershire to Westminster in London over eight days . And, speaking ahead of starting his swimming this morning, Walliams added: 'Today will see me entering the tidal stretch of the Thames with all the dangers that brings, so I'll need to be strong.' Last night, Walliams ended his day by arriving at Teddington Lock just before 8pm, greeted by his proud and relieved wife. Lara . immediately tweeted her congratulations, . exclaiming: 'Made it to Teddington Lock, beyond proud!!! @sportrelief . #thamesswim #GODAVID.' Keep going: Walliams, who was said to be 'dog-tired', sits on the support boat for the interview . Hero's greeting: David Walliams was given a warm welcome at lunchtime today, before setting off again for Teddington . It had been another tough day, which has seen David swim an astonishing 21 miles. With his Thames tummy taking its toll and the cold rainy weather conditions, he tested himself to the limits of his endurance. Concerned Lara tweeted yesterday afternoon: 'Poor David . is in so much pain! Please keep supporting him, remember how far he's . swam, and why he's doing this @sportrelief #thamesswim'. To sponsor Walliams, go to www.sportrelief.com/donate/walliams. Taking its toll: Walliams looked cheerful despite his 'Thames tummy' on the second to last day of his swim .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 2:09 AM on 15th July 2011 . Ulrika Jonsson claimed last night that she was warned by a senior News of the World executive not to leave voicemail messages âbecause they can get thoseâ. The TV presenter, a former columnist with the newspaper, said she âfelt very sickâ when also told by the police that her phone may have been hacked. Miss Jonsson, 43, said on ITV1âs Tonight Programme that she was contacted by detectives about âsome very important evidenceâ. Ms Jonsson will appear on TV tonight in an interview in which she claims she was told by a NotW editorial executive to delete answer phone messages from her mobile . The extraordinary revelation made . today came as a cousin of Jean Charles de Menezes was told by police . that their name was found on a hacker's list. Mr de Menezes, 27, was shot dead by . counter-terrorism officers hunting would-be suicide bomber Hussain Osman . the day after the failed July 21, 2005 attacks on London. In another development, glamour model . Abi Titmuss announced that she would be suing the NotW over fears that . her phone was also hacked. Glamour model and actress Abi Titmuss is taking legal action against the News of the World after police informed her that her phone may have been hacked. The former nurse came to prominence in 2003 when she was dating former TV host John Leslie, later launching her own modelling and presenting career. She joins a number of other celebrities and well-known figures who have begun legal proceedings. Titmuss, 35, has appointed lawyer Charlotte Harris of legal firm Mishcon De Reya, who is already representing Sky Andrew, Leslie Ash and Lee Chapman among others in their claims. Titmuss's agent said today: 'We can confirm that Abi Titmuss is taking action against the News of the World following notification by the police that her phone was intercepted over a long period of time.' Titmuss became a familiar face as she supported Leslie when he was accused of rape. The case was dropped by prosecutors. She went on to become a 'lad's mag' favourite and has gone on to forge an acting career. She is currently in rehearsals for a leading role in Dusk Rings A Bell at the Edinburgh Festival in August. Earlier . this morning one of the News of the World's former executive editors, . Neil 'Wolfman' Wallis, a deputy under Andy Coulson was arrested. Ms Jonsson, whose love life has been in the spotlight on a number of . occasions over the years, told of her distress when she was contacted by . police about being monitored. Speaking on ITV1's Tonight . programme which airs this evening, Ms Jonsson said she was sickened to discover she was being watched. 'I . was contacted by the Met Police on my mobile phone and they left me a . number and said please call me back we have some very important evidence . we want to show you,' she said. 'There were pin codes, numbers for my . automatic front gate where I lived and the feeling that, according to . these notes, that I was definitely being watched. 'Immediately . my head started pounding. I feltâ¦ I really felt very sick. I felt . immediately like my stomach was turning. I felt really scared - . somebodyâs been watching or certainly somebodyâs been listening to my . life.' Presenter Alastair . Stewart asked her if a senior member of staff at the News of the World . had warned her to be careful and she responded: 'Yes, someone warned me . not to leave voicemails. 'Because they can get those. The couldn't intercept text messages but they can get voicemails.' He probed further: 'An editorial executive at the the News of the World warned you to be cautious.' To which she replied: 'Indeed.' Detectives have also told a cousin of Jean Charles de Menezes his number was found on the phone hacking list of a News of the World private investigator. Other people connected to the young Brazilian shot dead by police marksmen at Stockwell Tube station in 2005 fear they too may have been targeted. Relatives, campaigners and members of the family's legal team have given police their phone numbers so officers can check whether they were victims of hacking. His family said that officers from Operation Weeting, Scotland Yard's new phone hacking inquiry, confirmed yesterday that the mobile phone of his cousin Alex Pereira was found on a list compiled by private investigator Glenn Mulcaire. Andy Coulson, left, was arrested and released on bail until October while Neil Wallis was detained this morning . A spokesman for the Justice4Jean . campaign said: 'The Menezes family are deeply pained to find their . phones may have been hacked at a time at which they were at their most . vulnerable and bereaved. 'They are bewildered as to why the police did not approach them with this information earlier, and fear the police may be attempting to cover up their own wrongdoing once more relating to this case.' The family of Jean Charles de Menezes raised concerns that their phones may have been hacked . Mr . de Menezes's family today called on David Cameron to widen the scope of . the phone hacking inquiry to look at alleged police leaks to the media . during the investigation into the Brazilian's death. Relatives of Mr de Menezes wrote to the . Prime Minister: 'We are conscious that the newspapers owned by News . International provided some of the most virulent and often misleading . coverage around Jean's death and its aftermath. 'Throughout the investigation, misinformation continued to be leaked to the press that attempted to besmirch Jean's character. 'The publication of these lies about his actions on the day of the shooting included false allegations that Jean Charles was wearing a bulky jacket, had failed to stop after a police warning, had jumped the ticket barriers or had acted suspiciously in the moments leading up to his shooting. 'They also related to untrue allegations about his immigration status and even attempts to link him to a rape allegation that could only have emanated from police sources.'

"By . Stephanie Darrall . Last updated at 2:51 PM on 30th August 2011 . Predators: The conditions of British waters are ideal for Great White sharks . British waters are an ideal hunting ground for great white sharks, who are already 'occasional vagrant visitors', claims a shark expert. President of the Shark Trust Richard . Peirce said that it is only a matter of time until his theory that the predators visit British shores is verified. Mr Peirce believes he almost proved the presence of a great white in the UK with a photograph of a shark . caught off the north-east coast of Scotland. He said: 'I sent the photo to some of the . world's leading experts but as soon as they heard it was caught off . Scotland they started looking at what else it could be.' 'The real surprise is . that we don't have an established white shark population, because the . conditions here mirror those in parts of South Africa, Australia and . northern California. 'The normal range of water temperature for great whites is between 14C and 20C which fits with British water in the summer.' The shark expert has investigated . more than 80 reported sightings of great whites in British waters over . the last 14 years but only seven were found to be credible. Fishermen in Cornwall have reported . great whites sticking their heads out of the water, known as . 'spy-hopping', and fishermen on three different boats described a . sighting of a great white within three weeks of one another. Mr Peirce said: 'The reason the . evidence is so compelling is that it's from independent witnesses who do . not know each other on different boats. 'The problem is these things happen . in a flash. Unless the shark jumps right out of the water or is caught, . all we'll see is a dorsal fin sticking out the water. 'The closest capture of a great white . was off La Rochelle (in western France) about 200 nautical miles from . UK shores which is no distance to them.' There have been sightings of other sharks in British waters over the summer. Earlier this month fisherman Jim Millar spotted a 15ft thresher shark off Dartmouth in Devon, where they are very rarely seen. Another fisherman caught a 21 stone porbeagle shark off the coast of Donegal, Republic of Ireland, last month. There have also been two separate sightings of what was believed to have been an oceanic whitetip shark, a species also known to attack humans, in St Ives, Cornwall, in June. Mr Peirce believes it is only a matter of time before proof is found that the species at the top of the marine food chain, the great white shark - Carcharodon carcharias - is occasionally present in British waters. He said: 'Great whites are highly . nomadic in movement around the north Atlantic so it's reasonable to say . there's a good chance they may stray into British waters. Expert: But Richard Peirce's theory is not universally accepted by scientists . 'I do suspect we do get the occasional vagrant visitor.' Global warming may have driven the sharks' prey further north, added Mr Peirce, which could further entice the great white to British shores. He said: 'The water temperatures around Britain are well within the great white's tolerance range. So in theory there's no reason they shouldn't be here already without global warming. 'But what may be happening is that it may affect the distribution of shark's prey - meaning they may follow that.' However Dr Russell Wynn, co-ordinator of the SeaWatch SW project and a . senior marine scientist at the National Oceanography Centre in . Southampton, said the odds of a great white being found in British . waters were extremely low as the creatures are very rare in the . northeast Atlantic. The . SeaWatch SW survey team has spent more than 5,000 hours scanning the . seas off southwest England in the past five years but the only predatory . sharks seen have been single blues and threshers. Habitat: A map showing the global distribution of the Great White Shark . 'The only large shark the public are . likely to see is the harmless plankton-feeding basking shark, which can . grow to over 10m long and is occasionally seen leaping out of the . water,' he said. But Dr Wynn accepted there was a small chance of a great white sighting off the British coast. 'It's . certainly not impossible that a great white could be seen or caught in . British waters one day, as we know they occur off southwest Europe in . very low numbers.' Spotted: In recent months both thresher (left) and porbeagle sharks have been seen around the British Isles . But despite the recent sightings, the opportunity of seeing sharks is decreasing year on year. A study by Dalhousie University in Nova Scotia, Canada, concluded that the North Atlantic shark population had declined by more than 50 per cent between 1986 and 2000 due to overfishing. Mr Peirce said: 'Unless we do something about shark mortality in the Atlantic we won't be having this conversation in 50 years time.'

"By . Stephen Wright . Last updated at 12:09 PM on 13th September 2011 . Priorities: Bernard Hogan-Howe joins the Metropolitan police at a time of change and difficulty . A plain-speaking police chief renowned for his ruthless obsession with cutting crime was yesterday appointed head of the beleaguered Metropolitan Police. Bernard Hogan-Howe, 53, vowed to put fear back in the minds of criminals after winning the race to become commissioner at Scotland Yard. Britainâs new top officer faces an enormous task trying to restore morale in the Met in the aftermath of the phone hacking scandal, widespread criticism of the forceâs handling of the London riots and concerns about burglary and robbery figures. He will also assume overall responsbility for counter-terrorism in the run up to next yearâs Olympic Games in London. Mr Hogan-Howe is the forceâs third chief appointed in six years following the controversial exits of his two predecessors, Sir Ian Blair and Sir Paul Stephenson, making it the hottest seat in British policing. He was handed a five-year contract after convincing interviewers he could lead a ânew, more transparentâ era for the force. The former Merseyside chief constable could not disguise his delight at landing the job. âItâs the highest accolade that any police officer could have,â he said. Outlining his targets, he added: âThe idea is to make the criminals fear the police and what they are doing now.â One of Mr Hogan-Howeâs priorities will be ensuring the Olympic Games pass off peacefully at a time of unprecedented police funding squeezes. He is expected to run a tight ship at the Yard and will move quickly to shake up the Metâs senior management team. Assistant Commissioner Cressida Dick is tipped as a strong contender to be his deputy. Mr Hogan-Howe beat off a strong challenge from Sir Hugh Orde, the much respected but outspoken president of the Association of Chief Police Officers, to land the Â£276,000 a year job. The other contenders were acting commissioner Tim Godwin, who now reverts to being deputy commissioner but who is expected to leave the Met in the next few months, and Strathclydeâs chief constable Steve House. A number of members of the Metropolitan . Police Authority were keen for Sir Hugh to be appointed but Home . Secretary Theresa May, who has been angered by Sir Hughâs attacks on . government policy, was never likely to sanction such a move. Announcement: Bernard Hogan-Howe, centre, was chosen by Home Secretary Theresa May, left, and Mayor of London Boris Johnson, right, to be the new Scotland Yard Commissioner . Resignations: Former Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Paul . Stephenson, left, and deputy commissioner John Yates, right, both left . the force in the wake of the News of the World phone hacking scandal . Unsuccessful: Sir Hugh Orde had been widely tipped for the top job . She said: âBernard has an excellent track record as a tough single-minded crime fighter. He showed that in his time as chief constable of Merseyside, and Iâm sure heâs going to bring those skills and that ability to fight crime to the Metropolitan Police here in London.â London Mayor Boris Johnson said: âIt was a very strong field but I think the Home Secretary and I were agreed that Bernardâs performance was outstanding, and he really commended himself above all by his relentless focus on building on the work of Sir Paul Stephenson and Tim Godwin in driving down crime.â Mr Hogan-Howe was parachuted into the Met as acting deputy commissioner after Sir Paul and Britainâs anti-terror chief, assistant commissioner John Yates, quit in quick succession. The surprise move was a clear indication that he was in line for the top job on a permanent basis. He had previously been working for Her Majestyâs Inspectorate of Constabulary. Untouchable: Hogan-Howe has been compared to legendary U.S. lawman Eliot Ness (pictured as played on TV by Robert Slack) Bernard Hogan-Howe is an advocate of zero tolerance policing and waged what he called a âtotal war on crimeâ against the gangsters and villains of Merseyside when he was chief constable there. It worked. During his five years in charge, from 2004 to 2009, crime was reduced by almost a third and anti-social behaviour by 25 per cent. A force which had once been rated the worst in the country for public confidence became one of the countryâs best. Everyone from vandals to drug-takers to fare dodgers was targeted. And, when Mr Hogan-Howe was unhappy with the sentences they were given by the courts, he was not afraid to say so. He has been nicknamed Eliot Ness â the legendary lawman in Prohibition America whose hand-picked team of Untouchables brought down Al Capone â for his zero-tolerance on gun and knife crime. Mr Hogan-Howe led his officers in Merseyside as they investigated some of the most sensitive and appalling crimes of recent years, including the racist killing of Anthony Walker, a black student, with an ice axe and the gun murder of 11-year-old Rhys Jones â the innocent victim of a gangland feud. The Rhys Jones investigation, considered incredibly challenging because of the culture of silence attached to gangs, saw officers cleverly recruit a teenage supergrass as their main prosecution witness in order to crack the case. Such experiences will stand him in good stead at the Met, where tackling the gang culture blamed for last monthâs riots will be one of his most important jobs. He will also need all his experience of handling delicate racial problems in the wake of the fatal shooting which proved the trigger for widespread destruction. The married 53-year-old, an avid football fan who is a tough-tackler on the pitch, began his career in his native Sheffield in 1979. Identified as a high-flyer, he was sent to Oxford University by the police. He has an MA in law from Oxford, a diploma in applied criminology from the University of Cambridge and an MBA from the University of Sheffield. If that sets alarm bells ringing â the very politically-correct Sir Ian Blair had a similarly academic background â Mr Hogan-Howe is said to have drawn experience from another ex-Met Commissioner: Sir John Stevens. As an assistant commissioner at the Met from 2001 to 2004, he watched as Sir John ran the force with an iron-grip, leaving his officers in no doubt of what was expected of them. He will need a similarly robust attitude to bring order to the Met now. But few who saw him in action in Merseyside doubt he is up to the challenge.","Bernard Hogan-Howe is the Met's third chief in six years .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 8:26 AM on 14th September 2011 . A Deutsche Bank vice president filed a gender bias lawsuit accusing the German bank of denying her pay and promotions, and trying to demote her because she took maternity leave. Kelley Voelker, who works in New York in a hedge fund group, said she has never been promoted in her 13 years at Deutsche Bank despite being qualified to become a director. Ms Voelker, who is in her mid-40s, sued the bank in papers filed on Monday in U.S. District Court in Manhattan. Mother: Kelley Voelker said she rejected her boss' urging that she take a 'reduced role' after her return from maternity leave in May 2010 . A Deutsche Bank spokesman said: 'We take these allegations very seriously and are currently reviewing the complaint.' In her complaint, Ms Voelker said she rejected her boss' urging that she take a 'reduced role' after her return from maternity leave in May 2010. Upon her return, she said, Deutsche Bank directed bigger accounts to a male colleague, slashed her bonus, and tried to demote her to a 'vague' marketing job. The bank retracted the demotion after her lawyers complained, she said. The lawsuit states: 'Plaintiff was retaliated against and ultimately 'mommy-tracked' for her decision to take maternity leave.' However, 'It is not surprising that such discriminatory treatment is permitted when the company tolerates managers to use (derogatory terms), as well as allowing supervisors to entertain clients at strip clubs and make open remarks about pregnancy,' the lawsuit states. The lawsuit states that the company 'fosters an atmosphere where it seems appropriate to derail the careers of hardworking mothers like Ms Voelker while promoting the chauvinist ideals' it is said to hold. Glass ceiling? Ms Voelker states in the lawsuit Deutsche Bank directed bigger accounts to a male colleague, slashed her bonus, and tried to demote her to a 'vague' marketing job . According to the filings, Ms Voelker is seeking compensatory and punitive damages, among other remedies. Ms Voelker said she also filed a discrimination case with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. Like many other lawsuits alleging gender bias on Wall Street, the complaint also provides illustrations of alleged 'hostile and degrading' conduct by bank employees to women. In one instance, at a 2009 meeting where Ms Voelker questioned a decision by a supervisor, her boss said: 'I'd watch your step - she's pregnant,' the complaint said. The law firm Thompson Wigdor represents Ms Voelker. That firm also represents Nafissatou Diallo, a hotel maid who accused former International Monetary Fund chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn in a civil lawsuit of attempting to rape her. Criminal sexual assault charges against Strauss-Kahn were dropped last month. Goldman Sachs Group Inc last November won the dismissal of a lawsuit, also filed by Thompson Wigdor, by a former vice president who said the bank unlawfully fired her while she was on maternity leave. Last month, U.S. District Judge Loretta Preska in Manhattan dismissed an EEOC lawsuit accusing financial news company Bloomberg LP of a pattern of discrimination against pregnant women and mothers returning from maternity leave, even if there were cases of individual bias. Bloomberg said that lawsuit lacked merit.","Plaintiff says she was 'mommy-tracked' by bank .

Their $2.2million home was in Isleworth, Florida - once a community home to top golfers Tiger Woods and Arnold Palmer.

A murder hunt has been launched after a motorist was stabbed to death in front of his terrified female passenger. Brave Harjinder Singh Bhurji, 32, was fatally stabbed as he tried to fend off the masked knifeman who was trying to grab his car keys. He was left bleeding to death from knife wounds in the road in front of the terrified passenger in Ilford, East London at around 1am yesterday. The man threatened to kill the passenger, in her 20s, if Mr Bhurji didn't hand over the keys to his black Mercedes. But when he did he stabbed him in the chest anyway. The car was found dumped an hour later in Chingford, three miles away from where Mr Bhurji was fatally attacked in Ilford, east London. Murder Squad detectives are appealing for witnesses who may have seen the knifeman driving in the early hours. Detective Chief Inspector Phil Rickells, who is leading the murder inquiry, said: 'The suspect appears to have been purely motivated by stealing the car because at this early stage we can find no other obvious motive. 'As far as we can tell, the victim did not know the suspect or why he might want his car. 'The Mercedes had a distinctive number plate and I would appeal to anyone who was out driving in the early hours to cast their minds back and let us know if they saw it.' The suspect is described as black, about 6ft 2in, of slim build and was wearing a grey 'beanie' hat, grey hoodie and dark-coloured bandana. He spoke with a London accent. DCI Rickells added: 'Police were called at 1.10am to reports of a man injured. When they arrived, they found 32-year-old Harjinder Singh Bhurji suffering from a chest wound. Search: Police are now hunting the driver and anyone who may have seen the car being driven . 'He was pronounced dead at the scene in Stoneleigh Road, Ilford, at 1.42am.Â  The victim's friend, who was with him at the time, was found at the scene uninjured but suffering from shock. 'It is believed that the two had been sitting talking in Mr Bhurji's car when the suspect suddenly appeared, opened the passenger door and dragged the female occupant from the car. 'The suspect then went to the driver's door and demanded the keys to the black Mercedes, CLK coupe, registration number R4 JXW. 'Mr Bhurji who lived in Ilford, tried to hide them under his seat but the suspect threatened to harm his friend if he did not hand them over. 'However, before he had time to retrieve them, he was stabbed. Despite his injuries, the victim managed to retrieve the keys and hand them to the suspect who then drove off.' Scene of death: Stoneleigh Road in Ilford where Harjinder Singh Bhurji was murdered in a suspected carjacking . The car was found abandoned at 2.45am in Forest Glade, Chingford. Mr Bhurji, a successful garage owner, was stabbed to death just two weeks after celebrating his sister Rasdinder Johal's wedding. His grieving sibling said her brother was a 'polite, quiet and reserved' man, the main breadwinner for their family, who had footed the bill for her nuptials. He had been due to fly to India to be the best man at his friend's wedding and had been making the final arrangements shortly before he died. She said: 'My brother was a very calm and very quiet and very reserved type of person. He loved to travel. Every month he would go somewhere and he was just enjoying life. 'He wanted to get married but he didn't have a partner and he was looking.' Abandoned: The Mercedes - registration R4 JXW - was found in Chingford . As a Mercedes specialist, he ran his own company R&J Motors, which also employed his father and brother. He had previously worked for Mercedes in Lakeside. Rasdinder has now urged the woman who was with her brother to contact them and let them know what had led to his death. She added: 'We don't know who she was. That's the thing we don't know - why he was with her or talking to her when he was stabbed by a six foot two inch attacker. 'The family are devastated. My mum is not coping very well. He was her only son, her eldest son, he was the breadwinner of the family. 'Everyone is just really in shock and devastated. We have just had the wedding and our whole family came from across the world for it. 'I have just come back from honeymoon two days ago. Everyone has recently been together and now this.' She added: 'I want to know the details. Our whole family just want to know what happened to him for our peace of mind.' Detectives are keen to hear from anyone who saw the car, possibly driving at high speed, anywhere between Stoneleigh Road and Forest Glade, a journey of about three miles. DCI Rickells said: 'It is possible the suspect travelled down the A406 North Circular Road or through main back roads.'","Harjinder Singh Bhurji, 32, bled to death after being stabbed in the chest .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 8:18 AM on 14th September 2011 . 'Rich man's toy': Philip Hammond, the Transport Secretary, admitted only the wealthy can afford rail travel . Rocketing fares mean that the railways have become a ârich manâs toyâ, Transport Secretary Philip Hammond admitted yesterday. He acknowledged that inflation-busting . ticket increases meant that customers who travel by rail have . âsignificantly higher incomesâ than the general population. He added that some fares on the West . Coast Mainline had become âeye-wateringlyâ expensive and that the . planned new high speed link would probably be out of reach to âfactory . workersâ. His comments to MPs on the Transport . Select Committee will enrage commuters because the increase is blamed on . the Governmentâs decision to reduce the costs to the public purse of . running the rail network. 'Uncomfortable fact number one is that . the railway is already relatively a rich man's toy,' Mr Hammond told . the Commons Transport Committee. 'People who use the railway on average have significantly higher incomes than the population as a whole - simple fact.' The minister described ticket prices on the West Coast Mainline as ranging from 'eye-wateringly expensive to really quite reasonable if you dig around and use the advance purchasing ticket options that are available'. But he insisted that even those who are too poor to enjoy rail travel would still benefit from projects like the planned HS2 high speed rail link between London and northern England - because their bosses will be able to get around easier. 'If you are working in a factory in Manchester you might never get on HS2 but you would certainly be benefiting from it if the sales director from your company is routinely hopping on it to jet round the world from Heathrow in a way that brings in orders that keep you employed,' he said. 'Eye-wateringly expensive': Mr Hammond said it was a 'simple fact' that people who travel by rail on services like the West Coast Mainline earn more than most . Commuters reacted with horror last . month when the government announced it was changing the formula for . calculating fare increases from the rate of inflation according to the . Retail Price Index (RPI) plus 1 per cent to RPI plus 3 per cent. With . July's RPI remaining unchanged at 5 per cent, it means season ticket . holders face a hike in fares of an average 8 per cent in the new year. Worse . still, the 8 per cent rise can be taken by train companies as an . average, meaning passengers could face even higher increases in their . commuting costs. At the time, Mr Hammond said raising fares was 'a difficult decision' but extra money was needed to guarantee improvements to ensure railways were better value for money in future. That would allow us 'to put the era of above inflation rises in regulated fares behind us', he added. But shadow transport secretary Maria Eagle said the Government was 'totally out of touch with the cost of living crisis facing commuters' and failed to understand how 'eye-watering rail fare rises' would add to the burden on families. David Sidebottom, director of rail customer watchdog Passenger Focus, said regulating some fares was in passengers' interests but allowing train companies to set fares on individual routes was 'deeply unfair'. Transport workers union the RMT even warned that the price rises could cost the Tories key marginal seats as passengers voiced their anger at the ballot box. Economic benefits: Mr Hammond said the extra investment higher fares could bring would help executives do business more easily . Responding to Mr Hammond's comments, Stephen Joseph, chief executive of the Campaign for Better Transport said: 'Philip Hammond's description of rail fares as ""eye-watering"" must lead the minister to reconsider the steep fare rises currently planned by Government. 'Far from being simply ""a rich man's toy"" trains are also vital for many of those on more moderate incomes who need to get to work, and the Government will price many off the railways if it carries on with its plan to increases rail fares at three per cent above inflation over the next few years. 'Instead, the Transport Secretary's promised fare review must deliver simpler, fairer and affordable rail fares.'","'Simple fact' that train passengers are richer than average Briton, says Philip Hammond .

"By . Richard Shears . Last updated at 8:29 PM on 13th September 2011 . A South African couple's visit to New Zealand was to be the trip of a lifetime - a seaside hotel, a pier to stroll along and picturesque gardens to wander through. All this to enjoy while they were attending matches in which the South African team were bidding to defend the trophy at the Rugby World Cup. But there was just one little hiccup - Michael and Sunette Adendorff couldn't find the bayside Majestic Hotel - or even the street in the Eastbourne suburb of Wellington that it was supposed to be located in. Wrong one: The couple booked into this hotel in Eastbourne, East Sussex, when they actually wanted to stay in one in Eastbourne, New Zealand . On the other side of the world: Eastbourne in Wellington, New Zealand . Convinced they had lost their way, or there was something wrong with the GPS system in their rental car, they wandered into a shop to ask for directions. And it wasn't long before the truth dawned on them. The hotel they had booked into online was the Majestic in Eastbourne, UK, not a Majestic in Eastbourne, Wellington. 'I booked into the right hotel, just in the wrong country,' Mr Adendorff said. 'The Kiwis took the p*** out of us . because of our silly mistake but it was very nice and they were very . friendly,' he told the Dominion newspaper. Keen . rugby fans, the couple had decided to fly to New Zealand to watch their . team play in the world cup and had set about finding a hotel in . Wellington. Eastbourne in East Sussex has been a popular resort for tourists since the early 19th century. Its population is 98,000, with roughly 25 per cent of those in the over 60s bracket - well above the national average. It is thought that they retire there because of its 'quiet charm and elegance.' The town is focused on tourism, with more than four miles of shingle beaches. It also has a pier built in 1865 which houses an amusement arcade and nightclub. Temperatures in the town hit an average high of 20.5c in August. The town also hosts an annual airshow named Airbourne and a ladies tennis tournament prior to Wimbledon. Eastbourne, New Zealand, is a small suburb of Lower Hutt city, located on the southern tip of the North Island. It has a population of around 4,600. The town has a regular selection of shops, takeaways, restaurants and pubs to cater for its residents. For tourists, the location is a popular wind and kitesurfing location due to its frequently windy weather, while there are are also sheltered swimming beaches. Those more interested in keeping their feet on dry land can enjoy coastal walks among red northern rata trees. There are also three lighthouses at the heads of the coast, which prove popular with tourists visiting the town at weekends. They liked the website pictures of what they thought was the Majestic in Eastbourne, Wellington, but when they keyed in the booking, encouraged by the enticing description of the surroundings, they didn't realise they were looking at a hotel 12,000 miles away on England's south coast. In fact the British hotel is called the Bay Majestic, promoting splendid views directly opposite the beach 'within a few minutes' walk of the bustling pier and picturesque Redoubt Gardens, and lying close to the heart of the town.' Not realising the Majestic wasn't in Eastbourne, Wellington, the couple paid for their accommodation in advance for two nights. They were a little puzzled why the payment was in pounds, but went ahead with the booking. Unable to find Royal Parade when they arrived in Wellington and after driving around in circles the Adendorffs went into a chemist's shop in the Eastbourne suburb to ask directions. Employee Linda Burke said that when they asked where the Majestic Hotel was she told them: 'Oh no, there's no hotel here.' When she looked at the booking documents she broke the news: 'That's in the UK - that's in England.' The scenery in England: Eastbourne's pier and beach in England, UK . Miss Burke told the paper that she wasn't about to let them go without accommodation, so she offered to put them up in her own house for the night. She also took them out on the town for beers and dinner at a pub, where the locals gave them some good-natured ribbing. With their lost down-payment on the British hotel, the couple ended up about Â£200 out of pocket but they said Miss Burke's hospitality more than made up for the mix-up. The couple have moved to the town of Picton for a few nights but will be back in Wellington next week to stay at the West Plaza Hotel - and they've double-checked that it is in the New Zealand capital and is not some far-away hotel on the English coast.","Couple had travelled to watch the Rugby World Cup .

"Michael Brown has named his rottweiler-alsatian cross Charlie 'after Charles Kennedy' By . Anna Edwards . Last updated at 7:29 AM on 14th September 2011 . The millionaire fraudster who gave the Liberal Democrats Â£2.4million in stolen money has given the party fresh cause for embarrassment by naming his dog Charlie - after former party leader Charles Kenendy. Michael Brown, 45, has spent three years on the run after handing over the cash to the Lib Dem leader before being convicted of theft in his absence. The fugitive donor has named his rottweiler-alsatian cross Charlie, a business associate claimed to the Guardian newspaper. 'He told me that he had given money to a political party and that his puppy was named after the leader. He thought it was funny,' the friend claimed to the newspaper. Extra mile: Brown, right, named his puppy after former Lib Dem leader Charles . Kennedy, left, . Brown, who was convicted of stealing Â£36million from his clients in his absence in November 2008, has a Caribbean hideout in the Dominican Republic which has no extradition treaty with Britain. He and his dog have been seen in a gold Porsche Cayenne 4X4 as he spends his time at exclusive hang outs on the island. He skipped bail and disappeared in 2008 and now faces a seven-year jail sentence. Police, who confirmed he fled to the luxurious island, said they had been working urgently . behind the scenes for more than a year to bring him to justice. But so far Brown has managed to evade police and the courts for his crimes. Crook: Michael Brown donated Â£2.4million to the Lib Dems, but fraudulently obtained millions from various individuals including former Manchester United chairman Martin Edwards . Life of luxury: Michael Brown has been living in secret on the Dominican Republic for three years . He duped British authorities into giving . him a British passport, even though at the time he was on bail for a . Â£60million fraud case and images of him had appeared in newspapers . because of his huge donation. He had already been convicted of in 2006 for obtaining a passport by deception, the Guardian reported. It was this false passport that . allowed him to acquire fake Dominican documents, and he has applied for . temporary residency and put his name on the electoral register. Senior Lib Dem figures admitted they had spent all the money the fraudster handed them. Former leader Charles Kennedy said the donation â the biggest in the partyâs history â had âlong since been spentâ. He insisted the Lib Dems went the âextra mileâ to check out Brown before accepting the stolen cash ahead of the 2005 election. Fraudster: Michael Brown and his wife Sharon in Mallorca in 2008. He donated Â£2.4million to the Lib. Dems . Brown has been living a low-key life . of luxury on the island, renting expensive properties and playing golf . on exclusive courses. A photo from a golf club membership card revealed . he has lost weight, grown a beard and allowed his blond-dyed hair to . turn grey. It emerged two men suspected of helping him flee Britain and adopt a new identity were arrested and questioned last Friday. Senior officers are furious that the . details have emerged because negotiations to secure Brownâs extradition . were at a sensitive stage. No Briton has ever been forced to return from . the Dominican Republic but prosecutors remain hopeful they can secure a . ground-breaking deal. Mugshot: Michael Brown is trapped in the Dominican Republic . Last night, Brown had fled his luxury home but remained effectively trapped in the island country which neighbours Haiti. Detective Superintendent Bob Wishart, . of City of London Police, said: âWe remain determined to ensure Michael . Brown is returned to the UK to face justice and serve his sentence â . his victims and UK law demand no less.â Brown had been due to stand trial in . 2008 charged with 18 offences, including money laundering, theft and . perverting the course of justice. He posed as an international bond . dealer, pretended his father was a Lord, claimed connections with . royalty, and promised investors returns of up to 50 per cent. Among his . international array of victims was former Manchester United chairman . Martin Edwards, who handed over Â£8million. Brown mixed freely with senior Lib . Dem figures, and channelled his substantial cash gift to them through a . company called 5th Avenue Partners. The Electoral Commission investigated the affair but ruled the party did not have to hand back the money. The whereabouts of his wife of 15 years, Sharon, remains a mystery.","Michael Brown has named his rottweiler-alsatian cross Charlie 'after Charles Kennedy'

"By . James Tozer, Louise Eccles and Claire Ellicott . Last updated at 4:54 PM on 16th July 2011 . Victim: Tracey Elizabeth Arden, 44, died after being poisoned by a saline solution containing insulin at Stepping Hill Hospital, Stockport . Detectives investigating a hospital poisoner who has killed three patients will interview 11 patients who survived the effects of tampered medication. A 44-year-old woman, named locally as Tracey Elizabeth Arden, a 71-year-old man and an 84-year-old man died following the deliberate contamination of saline solution at Stepping Hill Hospital in Stockport, Greater Manchester. Insulin was found in a batch of 36 saline ampoules in a hospital storeroom close to Ward A1 after a nurse reported a higher than normal number of patients on her ward with unexplained low blood sugar levels. The alarm was raised on Tuesday but multiple sclerosis sufferer Ms Arden, from Stockport, died on July 7. She had been admitted to the hospital for routine drug treatment. The two male victims, who both had serious health problems, died this week. Detectives do know whether the killer is a visitor at the hospital or an employee there. Security has been stepped up, with the use of searches and entry restrictions. Greater Manchester Police's Major Incident Team is currently focusing its investigation from July 7 onwards but will review previous deaths at the hospital if new information comes to light. Police believe the insulin was deliberately injected into the saline containers which were used by at least two wards but they say the deaths remain unexplained as they await post-mortem results. Guards at Stepping Hill: Police said security has been increased at the hospital . A police source said: 'We are no . longer treating the tampered medication as a sole contaminated batch . because we cannot be sure that this was the only incident of its kind. 'We will be interviewing all those who . became ill from the contaminated saline to find out if they can shed . any light on who is responsible.' One of the 11 surviving patients . became very ill from her saline drip and has since recovered but the . others were not thought to be seriously affected. Security patrols have been stepped up as police methodically work their way through the hospital in interviewing doctors, nurses, porters, patients and visitors. Police have suggested to the hospital that they put measures in place to individually search everyone at the entrances. Assistant Chief Constable Terry Sweeney of Greater Manchester Police said: 'We have someone deliberately contaminating saline in the one place that people should feel they are being most cared for. 'We will be planning to take the person responsible for this contamination into custody and bring them to justice.' Considerable concern: Mr Sweeney said that the developments had worried patients but that his officers were working with staff to get to the bottom of what had happened . He stressed it would be exceptionally difficult to prove a link between the tampering and the deaths. 'This investigation is at a very early stage and we don't know what effect, if any, the solution has had to the wellbeing of any patients,' he added. 'We have recovered a number of ampoules of solution and are working closely with the hospital to try to get to the bottom of what has happened. 'Understandably there is considerable concern within the hospital and the wider community about this.' Tests found 36 saline ampoules had apparently been injected with insulin, a hormone which diabetics need to regulate their blood sugar but which can kill if given to non-sufferers who have other health problems. Police have suggested to hospital chiefs that anyone entering the hospital should be searched and a hotline has been set up for worried patients and families. Professor Vincent Marks, author of Insulin Murders, said: 'It's very hard to prevent the possibility of something like this happening because insulin has to be so readily available in hospitals. 'But it's actually not a very effective way of killing people. 'They would fall into a coma, and these days their blood sugar would be tested and they could be given glucose and would probably recover. 'Insulin is easily detected, but the hard thing will be proving if it has contributed to the deaths.' South Manchester coroner John Pollard has asked for any similar deaths at the hospital to be referred to him. Mr Pollard was the coroner duped by serial killer Harold Shipman. He told the official inquiry into the murders that he had tightened up procedures. Killer: 'Angel of death' nurse Beverley Allitt, right, with Sue Phillips and her baby daughter, Becky, who was murdered . The Stockport case has echoes of that of Beverley Allitt, a nurse who used insulin to kill four children at Grantham and Kesteven hospital in Lincolnshire between 1991 and 1993. Yesterday worried patients and visitors at Stepping Hill said they feared a rogue health worker was responsible. Clifford Monks, 84, who was receiving treatment for a stroke, said: âIt sounds like another Beverley Allitt. It can only be malicious â someone who has got a grudge against the hospital or someone who is insane and sick themselves.â In charge: Assistant Chief Constable Terry Sweeney will lead the investigation into the sabotage of saline solution with insulin at the Stepping Hill Hospital in Stockport . His daughter Carol Innes, 56, said: âWhat is most worrying is how random it is. They were of all ages and male and female, so whoever did this did not care who they hurt.â Susan Jones, 57, whose 82-year-old mother Elizabeth suffers from cancer and was discharged from Stepping Hill three days before the deaths, described the events as extremely alarming. âMum was on a lot of saline during her two-week stay so we are very concerned,â she said. âIt makes me shudder to think it could have so easily been her. âThere should be better measures in place to stop this happening. You expect your loved ones to be safe in hospital. This is very scary for everyone being treated here.â Dr Chris Burke, chief executive of Stockport NHS Foundation Trust which runs the hospital, said: âIt was the staff at the hospital who brought this matter to our attention and Iâve asked them to continue to be extra vigilant to help safeguard patients. âWe have increased security both in terms of access to the hospital and access to medicines and already replaced all saline ampoules across the hospital. âWe are doing all we can to protect our patients and ensure their safety.â","Patients given dangerous insulin and saline combination, murder method used by Beverley Allitt .

The loner who has said he killed an Hasidic boy was a strange man who looked like serial murderer Charles Manson, neighbours and friends claim. Levi Aron, 35, of Brooklyn, New York, admitted to murdering and dismembering eight-year-old Leiby Kletzky, and was arrested on Wednesday, police said. Neighbours of the so-called âButcher of Brooklynâ said he would stare strangely at schoolchildren and often became angry with no warning. Scroll down for video . Taken in: Levi Aron, right, the suspect accused of killing and dismembering eight-year-old Brooklyn boy Leiby Kletzy, is led into a police station on Thursday . Leiby disappeared on Monday while on the way to meet his mother nearby a day camp, but he got lost and asked Aron, a stranger, for help. Aron has been arrested on a second-degree murder charge after police found the boyâs remains in a fridge and dumpster. Aron worked for plumbing firm Empire State Supply in Brooklyn, where his boss described him as an âemotionally disturbedâ worker. âHe was very quiet, didn't communicate with people and he went home,â shop owner Michael Panzer told the New York Post. Comparison: Family acquaintance Lee Vogel, 21, said the âlook in his eyeâ of Levi Aron, left, reminded him of California serial killer Charles Manson, right . Neighbour Chaim Lefkovitz, 39, said parents would not let their children go near Aron because he would get âangry out of nowhereâ. Family acquaintance Lee Vogel, 21, told the New York Post the âlook in his eyeâ reminded him of California serial killer Charles Manson. Aronâs was little trouble to authorities prior to this week as the only fault on his record was a summons for public urination last year. But this quiet public man had a Facebook page with 220 friends and listed his favourite TV shows as âGleeâ and âThe Officeâ, reported the New York Post. Dead boy: Aron admitted to murdering and dismembering Leiby Kletzky, 8, and was arrested on Wednesday, police said . His favourite music artists included Katy Perry, Lady Gaga and the Black Eyed Peas. He also enjoyed singing Lionel Richie at karaoke. He was married in 2004 for just one year to Diana Diunov, 38, a woman later convicted on fraud and conspiracy charges, court records show. Shortly after this break-up, Aron met his next wife, Debby Kivel, 34, on the Jewish dating website SawYouAtSinai.com. They got married in 2006 and he moved from New York to Memphis, Tennessee, to join her and her two children. They divorced in 2007. Lost: Leiby seen in CCTV footage moments before he was abducted on his way home . She said he was injured aged nine in a bicycle accident and has been nervous around people ever since, but âloved childrenâ. His father is an accountant in Manhattan, his mother died of cancer around eight years ago and his sister Sarah died in 2009, reported the New York Post. But he has two brothers, Rocky and Joe, and was briefly engaged again with another woman after breaking up with Ms Kivel. Aron is now being investigated to see if he is linked to other missing children cases, reported WABC. The following transcript was posted on the NBC New York website, and has been edited to 'remove parts of an extremely graphic nature' - but not for clarity. These are Levi Aron's words written on a legal notebook during questioning, law enforcement sources told NBC New York. My name is Levi Aron... On Monday evening around 5:30 I went to my dentist, Dr Sorcher, to make a payment for visit for exam routine. Walking: Levi Aron is moved by police from the 67th Police Precinct in Brooklyn on Wednesday . A boy approached me on where the Judaica book store was. He was still there when went out from the dentistâs office. He asked me for a ride to the Judaica book store. While on the way he changed his mind and wasnât sure where he wanted to go. So I asked if he wanted to go for the ride - wedding in Monsey - since I didnât think I was going to stay for the whole thing since my back was hurting. He said OK. Due to traffic, I got back around 11:30 p.m. â¦ so I brought him to my house thinking Iâd bring him to his house the next day. He watched TV then fell asleep in the front room. I went to the middle room to sleep. That next morning, he was still sleeping when I was ready to leave. So I woke him and told him Iâll bring him to his houseâ¦ when I saw the flyers I panicked and was afraid.Â  When I got home he was still there so I made him a tuna sandwich.... Afterwards - I panicked because I didnât know what to do with the body.â¦ carried parts to the back room placing parts between the freezer and the refrigerator â¦ . â¦ went to clean up a little then took a second shower.Â  I panicked and ..

"By . John Stevens . Last updated at 5:47 PM on 15th July 2011 . Tragic: Ronni Chasen, 64, was shot dead in her car as she drove home through Beverly Hills . Leading Hollywood publicist Ronni Chasen was murdered with a gun stolen from a cop, the police have revealed today as they closed the investigation into the death, which stunned Los Angeles. Police said that Ms Chasen, 64, was killed after one of the four bullets to hit her exited her body and then hit her again. It is believed that she was a victim of an attempted robbery or road rage. A state of fear swept the city after Ms Chasen was shot dead on Sunset Boulevard on November 15 while driving home from a premiere party for the movie âBurlesqueâ. Rumours swirled around Hollywood that Ms Chasen has been targeted in a professional hit. But a law enforcement officer who has seen the final police report, which is expected to be released today, has revealed that the crime scene was consistent with an altercation such as an attempted robbery or road rage. Ms Chasenâs car was found with its window open a few inches. Police believe that Harold Smith, a 43-year-old ex-con, shot Ms Chasen. Smith shot himself dead on December 1 in a Santa Monica apartment building after being confronted by officers. The report revealed that the gun, . which was used in both shootings, was a revolver stolen from a police . officer during a burglary in the San Fernando Valley. Final hours: The evening before her brutal murder, Chasen, far right, arrived on the red carpet at the Burlesque premiere to support a client . Smash: Chasen was still breathing immediately after the crash, according to the first witnesses to reach her . Removed: Ms Chasen's damaged Mercedes Benz was towed away from Sunset Boulevard . Suspect: Harold Smith had been convicted for weapons and drugs charges . It is unclear what department that officer works for and when the weapon was stolen. The investigation concluded that it was unlikely that Ms Chasen has been killed in a professional hit. It . said that a professional would likely have used a more powerful weapon . and the hit would likely have been in a more remote location. The gunman also hit Ms Chasen in the shoulder and chest, rather than in a tight pattern. Ms Chasen received no death threats, was involved in no legal battles and seemed to live a ânormal lifeâ. The veteran publicist was driving her Mercedes Benz just after midnight on November 1 when she was shot in the chest, leading her car to smash into a light pole. Ms Chasen had just attended the premiere and after-party for the new movie starring Cher and Christina Aguilera. She lived in Westwood, some 10 miles away, and may have been driving home when the attack occurred. Grim: The LA county coroner removes Smith's body. Police confirmed the shooting was suicide using CCTV tapes . Apartment: Smith refused to surrender to officers and then pulled out a gun and shot himself in the head . The publicist ran her own public relations and marketing firm, Chasen & Co and was well known in the industry. She had worked as a publicist since 1973 with high-profile films on her resume like 1989's Driving Miss Daisy and 1994's Lolita. She also did work for the Cocoon and Rocky franchises as well as Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves. She was named senior vice president of worldwide publicity at MGM in 1993. MGM . executive Ashley Boone called Ms Chasen, 'One of the most respected . publicity executives in the business' with 'strength and expertise in . developing, positioning and executing productive motion picture . campaigns'.","Ronni Chasen killed after bullet exited her body and then hit her again .

With her bump proudly on show and a . beaming smile across her face, Carla Bruni looks overjoyed to be . expecting her second child at the age of 43. But the French First Lady has admitted the baby was both 'unexpected and unhoped for'. In an interview with a French . magazine, Miss Bruni admitted that the impending birth of her first . child with President Nicolas Sarkozy â they both have children from . previous relationships â was a complete surprise. Since marrying Mr Sarkozy in 2008, . following a whirlwind romance of just 80 days, she has often spoken of . the difficulties a couple of their age might have in producing a child. Mr Sarkozy is 56 and the baby is due in October, just two months before . Miss Bruni's 44th birthday. But speaking to Nice-Matin magazine, . the model-turned-singer said the fact that the couple were expecting had . made it 'a magnificent period in my life'. She said: 'I'm making an album, but it's not quite finished yet because of this happiness to come, unexpected and unhoped for.' She also played down rumours that she . was expecting a boy, saying: 'I don't know myself! There are things . that we need to keep secret.' Miss Bruni admitted she had spent the . last few weeks resting in the Fort de Bregancon, a presidential holiday . home on the French Riviera. 'For me, these are rest days, really.Â  In my state, I'm incredibly lucky to stay here, rather than in the city. 'And I'm waiting for my husband to come and join me this weekend, before we all go on holiday as a family in August.' Relaxed: French president Nicolas Sarkozy with wife Carla holidaying earlier this month near the luxurious Fort de Bregancon on the French Riviera . Strolling: The first couple of France are awaiting the birth of their first child . Asked if the baby will affect the way . the couple are viewed, Miss Bruni, who is five inches taller than her . husband, said: 'I don't know. 'The way people look at us from outside is . so different from what we are in our private life. It's so out of sync . that it's difficult to adjust their vision to reality.' She also insisted that Mr Sarkozy . will stand as president again next year, despite his current . unpopularity in the polls, saying: 'Yes, I wish it for France.' Easy peasy: Carla Bruni described her role as First Lady of France as not being as difficult as when she was a supermodel in the 1990s . Miss Bruni already has aÂ  ten-year-old son, Aurelian, from her relationship with Raphael Enthoven, a Paris philosopher. Mr Sarkozy has two sons, Pierre, 26, and Jean, 25, from his first marriage and Louis, a 14-year-old son, from his second. Political opponents have criticised . the couple, claiming the birth is ideally timed to happen just ahead of . Mr Sarkozy's campaign for the presidential elections in May 2012. France's Marianne news magazine said a . baby would be a 'perfect marketing tool', adding: 'It isÂ  a . âmarketing-babyâ that will be born just before the last months of . presidential campaigning really get going.' Fueling claims that she is a Marie . Antoinette figure enjoying an easy life at taxpayers' expense, Miss . Bruni said: '[Being] First Lady of France is not a burden. 'The weight of office falls on my . husband. Doing this for three years has been a lot less tiring than . spending ten years as a model.' Hard work: Carla Bruni-Sarkozy insisted she was not an 'airhead' and understood her duties as wife of the French president . The First Lady not only missed the 14th July Bastille Day ceremony in Paris, but also the Monaco royal wedding earlier this month. Asked if the fort was luxurious enough for her, Ms Bruni-Sarkozy paid tribute to Bernadette Chirac, her predecessor as First Lady. Ms Bruni-Sarkozy said: âI havenât touched anything, not even a curtain. It is very comfortable. I wouldnât call it Spartan. Itâs above all magnificent. Itâs undoubtedly due to the legacy of Bernadette Chirac, a real housekeeper. Me, Iâm a bit more bohemian. âFor me, these are rest days, really. In my state, Iâm incredibly lucky to stay here, rather than in the city. And Iâm waiting for my husband to come and join me this weekend, before we all go on holiday as a family in August.â Asked if an Elysee Palace baby will effect the way the couple are viewed, Mrs Bruni-Sarkozy, who is five inches taller than her husband, said: âI donât know. The way people look at us from outside is so different from what we are in our private life. 'Itâs so out of sync that itâs difficult to adjust their vision to reality.â French media have suggested that the birth of couple's first baby is ideally timed to happen just ahead of Sarkozyâs campaign for the presidential elections in May 2012. Franceâs Marianne news magazine said a baby would be a âperfect marketing toolâ for the Sarkozys ahead of the elections. The news magazine said: 'Politically speaking, the timing of this pregnancy is perfect. It is a âmarketing-babyâ that will be born just before the last months of presidential campaigning really get going.'",Wife of the French president confirmed pregnancy for the first time .
"By . Jacqui Goddard . Last updated at 12:01 PM on 14th July 2011 . Two theme parks are waging an international custody dispute in court â over a 17-foot killer whale. SeaWorld in Orlando, Florida, is demanding the return of Ikaika, a two-tonne, captive-born orca that it sent to Marineland in Niagara Falls, Canada, in 2006. But Marineland has defied the call â and a judgeâs order â and insisted that Ikaika stays, dismissing SeaWorldâs claim that the mammal was only a temporary loan and branding the dispute 'unfortunate'. SeaWorld in Orlando, Florida, is demanding the return of Ikaika, pictured swimming in a tank at Marineland in Niagara Falls . From left: Ikaika, Katina, and Taku perform in Sea World. Marine parks in North America are banned from importing wild-caught orcas, but the law does not apply to those born in captivity . It is now taking the case to appeal, despite a lower courtâs ruling that it must hand over the creature, and is contesting SeaWorldâs legal custody rights. 'The present dispute with SeaWorld over Ikaika is unfortunate. Marineland believes that Ikaika should be allowed to stay at Marineland, That was the original understanding between SeaWorld and Marineland,' said the Canadian parkâs 76-year-old founder and owner, John Holer, in a statement. Ikaika â whose name means âstrongâ in Hawaiian â is of value to any aquarium due to his future breeding potential. Marine parks in North America are banned under the Marine Mammal Protection Act from importing wild-caught orcas, but the law does not apply to those born in captivity. 'Holer has no other options. There are no other male orcas in Canada and no one else willing to send him any. Iâm not at all surprised heâs trying to dig in his heels and keep the whale,' said Julie Woodyer, campaigns director of Zoocheck Canada, a national animal protection charity. 'Ideally, of course, neither of them should have him. SeaWorld is probably the better of the two and Ike would probably live marginally longer there, but at the end of the day that whale is going to suffer. Orcas are a highly complex species and captivity is not the place for them.' Ikaika was born at SeaWorld in 2002, to mother Katina and father Tilikum. Tilikum has sired 13 offspring, making him the most prolific bull orca in captivity, but is better known for darker reasons: in 1991, he was among a group of whales at Sealand of the Pacific, a marine park in Victoria, Canada, that killed a trainer who fell into their pool and, at his current home at SeaWorld, Orlando, killed a second trainer last year. A dolphin show at Marineland, Niagara Falls, where Ikaika is currently staying, despite a judge's order that he is returned to SeaWorld . Dawn Brancheau, 40, died of drowning . and blunt force trauma during the February 2010 incident, in which she . was thrashed underwater during a âDine with Shamuâ show in front of a . paying crowd. She suffered a severed spinal cord, and fractured jawbone, ribs and vertebrae. Animal . welfare experts say that such incidents are symptomatic of the stress . suffered in captivity by orcas, a species that travels up to 100 miles a . day and dives thousands of feet deep in the wild. 'In . the wild, they use echo location but in captivity thatâs so . significantly limited that most of them donât even bother. They . effectively have to switch off a sense. In captivity theyâre in small . enclosures, smaller groups and their social and psychological needs just . canât be exercised as they should,' said Ms Woodyer. Ikaika was removed from his mother at the age of four and sent to Marineland on breeding loan, though he is not due to reach sexual maturity for several years. Marineland claims that the two parties have a written contract that states that it would only ever have to give up Ikaika if it was no longer able to maintain his upkeep. Shamu the killer whale performs at Seaworld, where Ikaika was born in 2002, to mother Katina and father Tilikum . SeaWorld argues that it is legally entitled to terminate the loan and that since 2009 it has been concerned about the animalâ s physical and psychological welfare. A judge in Ontarioâs Superior Court sided with SeaWorld last week, stating in a written ruling: 'In my view, SeaWorld has properly terminated the breeding loan agreement and is entitled to possession of Ikaika. 'Accordingly, an order will issue granting SeaWorld recovery of possession of Ikaika, and ordering Marineland to co-operate in any way reasonably necessary to allow the safe and expeditious transport of Ikaika from Canada to the United States.' SeaWorld says that it is now making arrangements for Ikaika to be relocated in the 'not-too-distant future', though Marinelandâs appeal is likely to delay that. Previous orca relocations have been performed using a Hercules aircraft carrying a giant water tank. Ikaika lives with another orca, Kiska, in a 4.5 million gallon tank called Friendship Cove and puts on a daily 'splash and jump' show for crowds. Fellow performers include dolphins, sea lions and walruses.",Marineland defying judge's order to return two-tonne whale to SeaWorld .
"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 2:41 PM on 15th September 2011 . Shocking claim: George Anthony, the father of Casey Anthony, believes his daughter or someone with her drugged his granddaughter thereby causing the youngster's death . The father of Casey Anthony believes his daughter - or someone with her - drugged his two-year-old granddaughter thereby causing the girl's death. He made the shocking claim in front of his stunned wife during a TV interview aired yesterday. His daughter was acquitted in July of murdering her daughter, Caylee, in a case that gripped America. The verdict caused national uproar with people venting their fury over social media as well as on radio and TV. 'I believe that Casey or someone else that she was with, possibly gave too much to Caylee, she fell asleep and didn't wake up. That's what I feel,' George Anthony said on theÂ  'Dr. Phil' show. Host Phil McGraw then asked him what substance he thinks could have been given to Caylee. He replied that it could have been a drug, such as the anti-anxiety medicine Xanax. He also mentioned chloroform, but seemed to discount that possibility. Mr Anthony then offered an explanation as to might have motivated his daughter to drug and sedate his granddaughter. 'To go out and have a good time, to be with friends, to have this life that she didn't have with Caylee,' he said. Anthony's parents shared their opinions during the second part of an interview with McGraw that was broadcast yesterday. The explanation from George Anthony, who also said that the pain of losing his granddaughter nearly pushed him to suicide, is similar to the view of some outside commentators on what may have happened to Caylee. Cindy Anthony expressed shock at her husband's explanation, and said on the show that it was the first time she had 'heard that out of his mouth' Two-year-old Caylee, left, and her mother Casey Anthony, right, during her trial at the start of July. Her acquittal caused national uproar with people venting their fury over social media as well as on radio and TV . The defense lawyer in the Casey Anthony murder trial has been hired to help a U.S. businessman held over the presumed death of his travel companion. Jose Baez (right) was the lead defense lawyer for Anthony in her trial. Mr Baez has now been hired to defend Gary Giordano in Aruba, who is suspected of killing Robyn Gardner. Ms Gardner, 35, from Maryland, was last seen alive on August 2 - two days after she travelled to Aruba with Giordano who she apparently met on a swingers sex website. He reported her missing and denies committing any crime, insisting the woman was swept out to sea while she was snorkelling. A body has not been found. Giordano's Aruban lawyer Michael Lopez says his client's father Frank hired Mr Baez, who will act as a consultant. He can service in an advisory role and provide other assistance but cannot actually argue in court on the Duth Caribbean island. Mr Lopez said: 'If my client wants me to share all information with Baez, I will do so, even though his role will be that of a consultant.' He added: 'If Casey is watching this someday - Yes, I think she's responsible for Caylee not being here.' But . his wife Cindy expressed shock at her husband's explanation, and said . on the show that it was the first time she had 'heard that out of his . mouth'. She believes that . Caylee Anthony drowned, that Casey knew where her toddler was buried and . may have had help placing her body there. Caylee Anthony was the focus of a . wide-ranging search after her disappearance in June 2008. Casey Anthony . told police that a fictitious babysitter had kidnapped the child. The . 25-year-old maintained the same story to her family until the child's . skeletal remains were found in a wooded area in December 2008 not far . from the the home of George and Cindy Anthony. During her trial prosecutors argued . that Casey Anthony killed the girl by smothering her with duct tape . and later buried her to hide the body. But defense attorneys suggested . that Caylee died from an accidental drowning in a backyard swimming . pool. She was acquitted in July, but convicted of four charges of lying to police. She is currently somewhere in Florida . serving a year of probation on a separate check fraud conviction. Authorities are keeping her whereabouts confidential for her safety. Despite her acquittal, Casey Anthony . has been scorned by the public, and her parents - who at times have . defended her - have not fared much better in popular opinion. The couple spoke with McGraw for a lengthy, . taped interview over a two-day period recently. A portion of the . interview devoted to Casey Anthony's murder trial will also be shown . later this month . Cindy Anthony said that while she believes her granddaughter drowned, she didn't believe defense attorney Jose Baez's assertion that George Anthony was there or helped cover up the death. She, too, said she thinks Casey knew where Caylee was buried and that is what upsets her most today. 'I believe Casey knew or had knowledge of placing Caylee there,' she said. '...I'm not justifying what Casey did. But until I find out what happened to Caylee and what happened to Casey that day, I have to live with what I know.' She also told McGraw that she prayed nightly during the past three years that if Casey was somehow responsible for Caylee's death that she'd go to jail. She said the fact that her daughter was acquitted tells her she wasn't at fault. 'When that verdict came in and Casey was found not guilty, I got my answer,' Cindy Anthony said '...I'm not gonna be her judge and jury. God is her judge and he set her free.' The first part of McGraw's interview with Cindy and George Anthony aired on ""Dr. Phil"" on Tuesday. Anthony's parents shared their opinions during the second part of an interview with Dr Phil McGraw that aired yesterday.

Police say no actual human remains have been found, despite earlier reports. West Valley City Police Lt. Bill Merritt told the Associated Press: 'We have not come across bones. Disappearance: Susan Cox Powell, a mother of two young children, was reported missing on December 7, 2009, when she was aged 28 . 'Right now, we haven't found anything except for these scents that these dogs are picking up.' Earlier, police offered details about . the find, saying the remains near Topaz Mountain in Juab County, Utah, . were recent and in what they told Powell's father amounted to a 'shallow . grave.' West Valley City Police Sgt. Mike . Powell added that an anthropologist even examined the remains to ensure . that they were not bones 'of antiquity' that had been buried in the . desert for decades. 'This is something that's going to be . interesting,' Sgt. Powell said earlier. 'We're not looking at some . Indian burial ground or old cowboy from the West. It's much more recent . than that.' Police did not fully explain why they earlier said they had found remains. Susan Cox Powell was 28 when she was . reported missing in December 2009. However the remains have not yet been . identified by authorities. Authorities . have been searching Utah's rugged desert for clues in the case of Mrs . Powell, whose husband liked to camp in the area. âIt's a game of patience at this . point,â a local police spokesman said. âWe need to slow down a little . bit and identify what it is we found.â Mrs Powell went missing after failing . to show up for her stockbroker job.

He went in freezing temperatures with . their young sons - then ages 4 and 2 - on the Pony Express Trail, about . 80 miles west of Salt Lake City. Family: Susan Powell is pictured with her two young sons and husband Josh, who went camping in freezing temperatures with the boys in December 2009 . The four-year-old confirmed the trip to police.

Mr Powell is the only person of . interest in the case but has never been arrested or charged. Police . claim he has been uncooperative. Authorities have been searching since Monday in the area near Topaz . Mountain in Juab County, Utah, and found the body with cadaver dogs. The site is about 135 miles southwest of the location where Mrs Powell was last seen in West Valley City. Concerns: Josh Powell, husband of Mrs Powell, is under a cloud of suspicion in her disappearance as he is the only person of interest in the case . Last month investigators searched mine shaft-dotted mountains near Ely, Nevada. 'I'm sure there are people who have died in the desert that nobody knows about'Chuck Cox, father of Susan Powell . In addition, West Valley City police served a search warrant on the Puyallup, Washington, home Mr Powell shares with his father. They seized computers and journals thought to have belonged to her. Mr Powell said he will not be commenting on the bodyâs discovery. This latest search is in an area popular for gem and rock hunters. Police have said Mrs Powell's husband liked to rock hunt in the area. Mrs Powell's father, Chuck Cox, said he is not sure the remains are his daughterâs - as the search area is a very deserted place.

The new defense secretary was left red-faced today after he told troops in Iraq that they were stationed there because of the 9/11 terror attacks. Leon Panetta made the gaffe as he addressed around 150 soldiers at the Camp Victory base in Baghdad. That explanation was initially used by the former Bush administration to justify the invasion of Iraq in 2003, but has since been firmly dismissed by President Obama and the 9/11 commission. He told troops: 'The reason you guys are here is because of 9/11. The U.S. got attacked and 3,000 human beings got killed because of Al Qaeda. 'We've been fighting as a result of that.' The previous administration originally linked the September 11 attacks to former Iraqi dictator, Saddam Hussein. Mr Panetta's spokesman, Doug Wilson, moved quickly to correct the mistake, and added that his boss is a 'plain-spoken secretary', the New York Daily News reports. He said: 'I don't think he's getting into the argument of 2002-2003.' 'He has made clear that the major threat to this country is coming from Al Qaeda and terrorist groups, and he has also made clear that wherever we are in the world today, that [Al Qaeda] is a principle reason for a military presence.' When pressed by reporters, he tried to explain his remarks by saying: 'I wasn't saying, you know, the invasion - or going into the issues or the justification of that. First-hand experience: U.S. Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta flies over Baghdad in a Blackhawk helicopter alongside Lieutenant General Lloud Austin, Commanding General of U.S. Forces in Iraq . 'It was more the fact that we really had to deal with Al Qaeda here, they developed a presence here and that tied in.' In the same address, he said that the U.S. will take unilateral action against Shi'ite militias armed by Iran who threaten . American troops. Last month 14 service members were killed in hostile incidents, the highest monthly toll in three years. Mr Panetta said: 'We are very . concerned about Iran and the weapons they are providing to extremists . here in Iraq.' Despite U.S. forces officially ending . combat operations in Iraq last August, troops have come under increasing . fire in recent weeks. American officials blame Shi'ite militias armed by Iraq's Shi'ite neighbour Iran for most of the recent attacks. Rallying the troops: Panetta addressing the troops in Baghdad . At . least three U.S. service members have been killed this month, including . one on Sunday, the day Panetta arrived in Baghdad on his first trip to . Iraq as defense secretary. Washington . still has about 46,000 troops in Iraq more than eight years after the . 2003 invasion overthrew Sunni dictator Saddam Hussein. Forces are due to be withdrawn by the end of the year under a security pact between the two countries. In . today's address, Mr Panetta said: 'In June we lost a hell of a lot of . Americans as a result of those attacks. And we cannot just simply stand . back and allow this to continue to happen.' Panetta said Washington's first effort would be to press Iraq to go after Shi'ite groups responsible for the attacks. He is scheduled to meet Shi'ite Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki later on today. Referring to the right of U.S. forces to defend themselves on Iraqi soil, he said: 'Secondly, to do what we have to do unilaterally, to be able to go after those threats as well, and we're doing that,' Hungry work: Panetta reaches for mustard and relish to go with his hotdog during lunchtime at Camp Victory in Baghdad . General . Lloyd Austin, the commander of U.S. forces in Iraq, declined to comment . on what specific measures unilateral action might . involve. He said: . 'I think what the secretary was pointing to was we'll do what's . necessary to protect ourselves and that could include a host of things . ... so we'll just leave it at that,' Hours after Panetta's . arrival, . militants fired three Katyusha rockets into Baghdad's heavily fortified . Green Zone, home to the massive U.S. embassy complex and Iraqi . government buildings, according to an Iraqi Interior Ministry source . Officials, including Panetta, have . been pressing Baghdad to decide whether it wants U.S. forces to stay . beyond the year-end deadline. Maliki has said he will abide by a . decision of the majority of Iraq's political leaders. Shake on it: Secretary of Defence with troops at Camp Dwyer, Kabul, Afghanistan . Forces in Iraq now operate . largely in the background, training and assisting Iraqi police and . soldiers against a weakened but still lethal insurgency that launches . hundreds of attacks each month. Mr Panetta, who as CIA director helped . oversee the covert raid that killed Osama bin Laden, said his number one . priority since becoming defense secretary was to defeat al Qaeda. He . told Congress last month there were still 1,000 al Qaeda fighters in . Iraq. His earlier blunder was not the first in his new job. During a visit to Afghanistan on . Saturday, he told reporters that America plans to keep 70,000 troops . there until 2014 - despite Mr Obama's announcement last month that he . would immediately begin to withdraw troops.

But astronaut Sandy Magnus may now be regretting not paying more attention to her hair, as pictures of her wild barnet beam around the world. The wacky 'do is the result of the zero-gravity conditions on board the International Space Station, where Dr Magnus and her fellow crew-members were snapped talking to President Obama. Scroll down for video . Up, up and away: Sandy Magnus' hair has stolen the show on the International Space Station . Wave: The astronauts say goodbye to the President at the end of the call . The president was making the last . ever call to space from the White House, but despite the historic . circumstances he could not resist slipping in a joke or two. When . the astronauts came on the line, the president said: 'Oh, I was just . dialling out for pizza and I didn't expect to end up in space.' Later in the call, he referred to the fact that 10 people - four members of the shuttle Atlantis and six residents of the space station - had to share the station's two toilets and Atlantis's sole toilet. In this picture Dr Magnus is earthbound, and so is her hair . 'My wife and daughters are always crowding me out â hopefully you all have a better arrangement up there,' he quipped. The main themes of his conversation were praise and thanks for the shuttle program's service. 'I know that there have been thousands who have poured their hearts and souls into America's space shuttle program over the last three decades that are following this journey with special interest,' he said. 'To them and all the men and women of Nasa, I want to say thank you. You helped our country lead the space age, and you continue to inspire us.' Sandy Magnus enjoys the upside of zero gravity as she floats about in a capsule . Atlantis is in the midst of a 13-day resupply mission to the space station. Its landing, currently set for next Thursday, will spell the end of the 30-year space shuttle program. Atlantis and its two sister shuttles, Discovery and Endeavour, are to be retired to museums. Obama said Nasa would continue to push the frontiers of space exploration and human space flight in the post-shuttle era. The White House has set a goal of sending astronauts to a near-Earth asteroid by 2025 and to Mars and its moons by the mid-2030s. In the meantime, commercial space taxis will be developed to resupply the space station, and eventually take astronauts up as well. Joker: Speaking to the crew of 10 Obama could not resist slipping in a joke or two . Obama noted that Atlantis' crew is leaving behind a U.S. flag that was flown on the very first shuttle mission, to be turned over to the first crew to arrive on the station on a U.S. commercial spacecraft. 'I understand it's going to be sort of like a ""capture the flag"" moment here for commercial spaceflight,' Obama said. 'So good luck to whoever grabs that flag.' Atlantis' commander, Chris Ferguson, said: 'We sure hope to see some of our commercial partners climbing on board really soon.' Earlier in the day, Atlantis' crew fixed another one of their main computers after it failed and set off an alarm that shattered their sleep. Nasa declared all five of Atlantis' primary computers to be working, pending evaluation of the latest shutdown. As their time at the space station wound down, the shuttle crew got another celebrity call Friday, this time from Sir Paul McCartney. 'Good luck on this, your last mission. Well done,' McCartney said in a prerecorded message. The wake-up music was Good Day Sunshine by the Beatles. The previous two days, Elton John and R.E.M.'s Michael Stipe sent greetings.

A former senior member of the Ku Klux Klan has been jailed for attempting to arrange a sexual encounter with two undercover police officers who he believed were underage girls. Neal Ray Schmidt, a former grand dragon of the Missouri chapter of the Klan, first met the police officers in an online chat room. The 59-year-old believed he was talking to two 14-year-old girls who claimed they were friends and lived near each other in McDonough, Georgia. Following a few general exchanges the former delivery man began to steer the conversation towards sex. According to the Examiner.com, Patrick Crosby, the U.S. Attorneyâs spokesman, said: 'Over the ensuing months, in an effort to groom the girls for an eventual sexual encounter, Schmidt sent sexually explicit videos of himself, as well as images and videos of child pornography.' In June last year Schmidt made arrangements to meet the girls for sex at a McDonough motel. However he was arrested by police officers in the car park carrying guns, sex toys and Klan paraphernalia. He later pleaded guilty in court for seeking to have sex with two 14-year-old girls. Hate group: A member of the Ku Klux Klan . On Thursday a judge in Atlanta sentenced Schmidt, from St.Louis, to 20 years in prison. After serving his sentence he will have to register as a sex offender. U.S. Attorney Sally Quillian Yates said: 'This case starkly illustrates how the Internet can expose our children not only to the predator down the street, but also to the would-be molester who lives hundreds of miles away.' Prosecutors also revealed that since his arrest in this case Schmidt has been charged with molesting his granddaughter in Missouri and with arranging to have sex with an underage girl in Florida.","59-year-old believed he was meeting two 14-year-old girls for sex at motel .

Levi Aron's ex-wife Diana Diunov, 38, has labelled him as a 'cold sociopath' and said he should not be allowed to claim insanity. Diunov, who is in jail herself for wire fraud, told the New York Post her former husband had mental problems but was 'very nice' to her. She even suggested he might have killed Leiby in order to become famous - deciding to 'try his luck' after watching the Casey Anthony case.

Students who attend former polytechnics are more likely to be unemployed or in low-skilled jobs at the end of their degree compared to those who go to more traditional universities. New figures revealed that graduates from universities such as London South Bank, London Metropolitan and Birmingham City are twice as likely to end up unemployed at the end of their degree compared to those from 'red brick' institutions such as Newcastle and Edinburgh. However the figures revealed that Oxford University - one of the most respected education establishments in the world - was falling behind Huddersfield, East Anglia and Hull universities in employment rates. Former poly: Graduates from polytechnics such as London Metropolitan University are more likely to end up unemployed compared to those from more traditional institutions . David Willetts, the Universities Minister - speaking to the Daily Telegraph - said the figures showed that some universities would have to 'raise their game'. The figures revealed that one in five graduates from some of the country's newer universities failed to find a job within six months last year - compared with one in ten elsewhere. Universities Minister David Willets said some institutions needed to 'raise their game' They also highlighted the devastating effect the recession has had on jobs opportunities for graduates with almost 20,000 former students still out of work six months after finishing their courses. This is a 50 per cent increase since before the recession. And instead of being in high-flying professional jobs -Â  as they may have expected before starting university - thousands of graduates have been forced to take low-skilled work as shelf-stackers, bar staff and cleaners. The figures - released by the Higher Education Statistics Agency - showed that 94 per cent of new graduates who attended the universities of Edinburgh and Newcastle had found a job or begun postgraduate study within six months. A similar success rate was seen at Bristol, Reading, Cambridge, St Andrews and Aberdeen universities. However just 78 per cent of those who graduated from the University of East London were in work or further study within six months. The picture was similar at many other former polytechnics. A total of 90.2 per cent of Oxford graduates were either working or doing further study within six months of completing their degree last year. This is down from its own figure of 92.6 per cent from the previous year and below the national average of 90.4 per cent. A spokesman for Oxford University told the Daily Telegraph that the rise in unemployed Oxford students was down to a drop in the numbers choosing to go into postgraduate study, possibly as a result of the financial climate.","Figures also reveal a rise in unemployed former Oxford University students .

Stroman said his sister was in the top floors of the World Trade Center's North tower when it collapsed after being hit by an airplane, although this claim has never been substantiated. On September 15, he shot Waqar Hasan, a 46-year-old Pakistani man, in the head while he was grilling hamburgers in a convenience store in Dallas.

The 25-year-old has been accused of duping famous bounty hunter Leonard Padilla into a futile search for her dead daughter Caylee because he claims she knew the little girl was not alive. Mr Padilla says he is filing the lawsuit against Anthony and her attorney Jose Baez to recoup money spent searching for Caylee and the cash needed for travel, private detectives, and security guards. Padilla says both Anthony and Baez knew that Caylee was dead but instead stated she was kidnapped. He has been joined by non-profit group . Texas EquuSearch who handed her a $100,000 lawsuit to her she was behind . bars in Florida as she waits for release this Sunday.

It has been a week of law suits for Anthony as she could face more questions over her daughter's death, after lawyers for the woman suing the 25-year-old for defamation demanded that she testify in the civil case. Zenaida Fernandez-Gonzalez has filed a lawsuit against the cleared mother, claiming her life was ruined after Anthony used her name when she told Orlando police little Caylee had been kidnapped by 'Zanny the nanny'. Her legal team have asked the court to force Anthony to give a deposition next week, as they fear once she is released from jail she will vanish under a new identity. Anthony's lawyers intend to block the move, claiming she is is 'emotionally and mentally exhausted' after the criminal trial. The demand came as Orange County Jail revealed twisted wellwishers are continuing to send Anthony money, swelling her jail commissary account to $470 - but it's still only $200 more before she was cleared of murder at the end of her sensational trial. Strangers from Iowa, Pennsylvania and . even Canada have been sending $10 and $20 money orders, which Anthony . has been spending on sweets including KitKats, Skittles and Reese's peanut butter cups in the run up to her release on Sunday. But two days after she walks free from jail, she could have to give a video deposition at the office of Fernandez-Gonzalez's lawyer. The 42-year-oldÂ  is suing Anthony for defamation, claiming she lost her flat and her job and found it impossible to find work in the three years since Anthony falsely said a fictitious nanny with the same name has her had abducted Caylee. Scroll down for video . Anthony stuck to her story for three . years, until her lawyer dropped a bombshell at theÂ  beginning of her . trial and revealed that the nanny had never existed. Instead, . she had made up the babysitter using Fernandez-Gonzalez's name. She had the idea after . she saw her details on an information card when they both visited an apartment . complex on the same day. Her . lawyer says after Anthony's claims were made public, Fernandez-Gonzalez . received death threats in the middle of the night against her and her . children. She was fired from her job as a housekeeper, and her landlord said he didn't want her on his property. Fernandez-Gonzalez's . lawyer, John Morgan, told ABC News he plans to interrogate Anthony . about her daughter's death - a move Anthony's legal team are likely to . strongly oppose, saying it isn't relevant to the civil case. Mr Morgan said: 'The first question I'm going to ask her is, ""Tell us the last time you . saw Caylee"". The second is, ""Tell us when you found out she was dead"".' Pocket money: Wellwishers, including a Pennsylvania woman also called Casey, have sent $10 and $20 money orders to the jail . Sweet treats: Funds in Casey Anthony's jailhouse account today reached $470 thanks to the donations . Dismissing . their possible objections, he said: 'Everything about the death of the . child is not only relevant, it's very relevant. It's the essence of the . case. America wants justice. They want to make [Casey Anthony] sit down . and tell them what happened.' He will hold a meeting with Anthony's lawyers tomorrow to discuss the deposition. Today . they officially filed an objection, asking the hearing to be cancelled . because Anthony had suffered 'trauma' during the murder trial. They . also claim that as the dates and location of her deposition have been . made public, her safety would be in jeopardy because of the 'numerous . threats that have already been made against her'. In . a verdict that shocked America, on July 6 the jury found her not guilty of . murdering her two-year-old old daughter, Caylee. She was sentenced to . four years in jail after being convicted on four counts of lying to . police, . Behind bars: Casey Anthony will walk free from Orange County jail on Sunday 17 July . The judge gave her . the longest possible sentence he could, but he said Anthony could . go free on July 17 because she has already served nearly three years and . will get credit for good behaviour. But Fernandez-Gonzalez's lawyers . want the court to compel her to appear at a deposition on July 19, because they are concerned when . she is released from prison on Sunday she will 'leave the jurisdiction . of this court, disguise herself, change her name, etc., making it . impossible to ever depose her.' Mr Morgan said: 'When . Zenaida first came to me, we never thought Casey would see the light of . day again. It was never about money in the beginning. Now, it's about . accountability and responsibility.' The civil trial is due to begin in February. Anthony . could also face two other civil actions. Prosecutors asked have the . judge to recoup investigative cost for them and authorities. New questions: Lawyer John Morgan says he plans to grill Casey Anthony over her daughter Caylee's death in a civil deposition for a defamation case brought by Zenaida Fernandez-Gonzalez . The . mandatory minimums for those are $100 per case for felonies and $50 per . case for misdemeanours. The state is seeking reimbursement for more . than that and said in a motion that it has documentation of what it . calls special costs. As Anthony prepares for her release on Sunday, money continues to be sent to her from as far away as Canada. Records reveal that sweet-toothed Anthony has been buying candy including Almond Joy bars as well as . packets of Skittles, KitKats and Reese's peanut butter cups. Other items purchased include nachos with cheese and a jalapeno dip, flour tortillas and peanut butter.","Leonard Padilla claims he was lied to and wants to recoup cash used searching for Caylee and travel, private detectives, and security guards .

The 31-year-old may not know it yet, but her new beau appears to have much more in common with Tiger than just a fondness for pretty Swedish blondes. Yesterday it was reported that Elin, a former model, had found love again with Jamie Dingman, a successful American investor and businessman.

"By . James Tozer and Louise Eccles . Last updated at 1:42 PM on 18th July 2011 . Two more suspected victims of the hospital insulin poisoner were named yesterday as the deadly speed with which the drug could have been used as a murder weapon became clear. Great-grandfather George Keep, 84, and 71-year-old Arnold Lancaster are feared to have died as a result of the sabotaged saline solution that is also suspected to have killed Tracey Arden, 44. Yesterday their families were coming to terms with the fact that their loved onesâ sudden and unexpected deterioration after being admitted to Stepping Hill Hospital in Stockport could have been down to a twisted poisoner intent on mass murder. Contamination victims: Arnold Lancaster, . 71, left, from Stockport, left, and George Keep, 84, right, both had . their medication tampered with . Last night detectives were continuing to interview around 60 medical staff who could have had access to the store room between wards A1 and A3 where 36 vials of saline solution are believed to have been deliberately contaminated with insulin. The hospital contacted police last Tuesday after a nurse reported a higher-than-normal number of patients with âunexplainedâ low blood-sugar levels. Fourteen patients are thought to have received overdoses, and the 11 survivors are to be interviewed by detectives once they have recovered in the hope that they can provide clues. Victim: Tracey Arden died following the deliberate contamination of saline solution at Stepping Hill Hospital in Stockport . Other deaths that could be linked to insulin poisoning at the hospital are to be referred to the local coroner, and detectives are prepared to widen their inquiry to dozens of potential murders going back weeks or even months. Mr Keep, a widower from Cheadle, near Stockport, who was suffering from lung cancer, was admitted to the hospital on June 27 after breaking his hip in a fall. He successfully underwent surgery, but in the following days his blood pressure and blood-sugar levels dropped, and doctors diagnosed fluid on his lungs. It is thought the insulin with which the saline had been contaminated may have been undermining his health, undetected by medical staff. At the start of last week his family were told he was too weak to continue receiving treatment, and he died last Thursday. Shortly afterwards police broke the news that he could have been poisoned. His daughter Carolyn Knowles, 59, said yesterday: âI keep putting it to the back of my mind, that there hasnât been foul play with my father. I just keep hoping that is the case.â Mr Lancaster, who never married and lived in sheltered housing in Romiley, Cheshire, died last Monday. His family, thought to be restricted to an elderly sister, was too upset to comment yesterday. The deadly effectiveness of an insulin overdose â if it is proved to have been used as a murder weapon â is demonstrated by the speed with which Miss Arden, the first known victim, deteriorated. The mother of two had suffered from a severe form of multiple sclerosis for 12 years, and her family were used to regular hospital visits. Devastated: Gary Arden, the brother of Tracey, said police visited his parent's home after her death and said the funeral would have to be cancelled . Her ageing parents, Keith and June, went to Stepping Hill to visit her after she was admitted on Thursday, July 7 with a suspected chest infection, leaving her at 4pm feeling reassured that âcolour was coming back into her cheeksâ. Yet barely an hour and a half later, they received a call saying she had taken a severe turn for the worse. They live just half an hour way, but by the time they returned to the hospital, she was dead. Her family were initially told she had died of a chest infection associated with her MS, but after the alarm was raised on the ward where she had been treated, they found themselves at the centre of a potential murder investigation. Inquests into the deaths are expected to be opened this week by John Pollard, the coroner who has admitted he was duped by Harold Shipman, Britainâs worst medical serial killer, who murdered more than 200 people.","George Keep, 84, Arnold Lancaster, 71 and Tracey Arden, 44, all died after medication was contaminated .

"Elisabeth 'became so enraged with James's handling of the scandal' she said he had 'f***** the company' But she denies she said the same about her father's favourite, Rebekah Brooks . Tycoon's biographer claims the family dynasty is in meltdown . By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 4:15 PM on 17th July 2011 . Rupert Murdoch's children are turning on each other over the phone hacking scandal engulfing his media empire, it was claimed today. His daughter Elizabeth said her brother had f***** the company', according to Michael Wolff, a biographer of the billionaire tycoon. Mr Wolff claimed the simmering family tensions exploded into the open at a book launch last Sunday for political analyst Philip Gould. Siblings at war: Elisabeth Murdoch, left, is said to be enraged at her brother James's handling of the scandal, and fears the media empire is falling apart . It was hosted by her husband, public relations guru Matthew Freud, and Times editor, James Harding. Miss Murdoch, 42, has denied she had said something similar about ousted News International chief executive and her father's favourite, Rebekah Brooks. But Wolff claimed on Twitter that those reports were 'incomplete', Tweeting: 'She said: ""James and Rebekah f***** the company.'""' Miss Murdoch is understood to be 'furious' by the meltdown of her father's worldwide empire. The crisis has led to the closure of the News of the World, the resignations of Ms Brooks, the arrest of former News of the World editor Andy Coulson and the launch of an FBI investigation in America into alleged hacking of 9/11 victims. Strong words: Wolff claimed on Twitter that Elizabeth accused her brother and Rebekah had 'f*****' the empire . Is it all over? Elisabeth has watched in horror as her father's empire has been immersed in scandal . Family fortune: James Murdoch, with father Rupert, has come under close scrutiny for his behaviour in the crisis . On Friday, loyal Dow Jones chief executive Les Hinton, who had worked for Rupert Murdoch for 52 years, resigned and now scrutiny is resting on her brother James. Wolff, a long-time critic of the deputy chief operating officer of News Corporation, told the Observer: 'What we are seeing is an enormous amount of frustration. 'James absolutely cannot survive. Whether or not he is legally culpable, he certainly mishandled this entire situation and has done for a long period of time.' Wolff believes he will 'go into some form of exile' and his father will be eased out of the company. Wolff added: 'Rupert will be put out to pasture and an outsider not named Murdoch will be put in charge.' End of an empire: Elisabeth had to deny accusing Rebekah Brooks of 'f******' the company . It was reported that the Murdoch family have been having regular quarterly summits to discuss the future of the company- the last one held in Australia. James Murdoch, heir to the media dynasty, has admitted that he misled . Parliament over the hacking scandal at the News of the World. He had wrongly maintained' it . was carried out by just one reporter, and said it was 'a matter of . serious regret' that he had approved out-of-court settlements with victims without knowing the full facts. On Tuesday, he will be placed under further . pressure when the parliamentary culture, media and sport committee quizzes him, his father and Rebekah Brooks about the scandal. It will demand he name those within . News International's headquarters in Wapping, east London, whom he has publicly referred to as 'wrongdoers' who 'turned a good newsroom bad'. Executives have appeared before the committee in the past, insisting there was no widespread phone hacking at the paper. They included Mr Hinton, former News of the World editor Andy Coulson, then managing editor Stuart Kuttner and News International senior lawyer Tom Crone.","Elisabeth 'became so enraged with James's handling of the scandal' she said he had 'f***** the company'

"By . Jack Doyle . Last updated at 1:59 PM on 17th September 2011 . No police officer will face disciplinary action over the death of Fiona Pilkington who killed herself and her disabled daughter afterÂ  a decade of unchecked abuse by yobs. Yesterday four officers accused of failing to stop the misery inflicted upon the family â who made dozens of 999 calls â were cleared of misconduct. The inspector, a sergeant and two constables were said in a report by the police watchdog to have âcases to answerâ. Tragic: Fiona Pilkington (left) and her daughter Francecca Hardwick, 18, died after a decade of taunting. Police officers will not face disciplinary action over their deaths . But Leicestershire Police said . internal hearings this week had concluded that the case against the . unnamed four was ânot provenâ. It means no individual officer has faced any disciplinary sanction over the case. A spokesman for the force blamed âsystems and processesâ for the failure to respond to the familyâs desperate pleas for help. At the time Miss Pilkington was . accused of âover-reactingâ to the torment inflicted upon her by a gang . of youths at their home in Barwell, Leicestershire. In October 2007 she . killed herself and her 18-year-old daughter Francecca, who had a mental . age of four, by setting fire to their car in a layby. The yobs, some as young as ten, threw . stones and eggs at their home, urinated on their wall, invaded the . garden and pushed fireworks through the letter box, leaving the family . âunder siegeâ. An Independent Police Complaints . Commission report found that Miss Pilkington, 38, contacted the force on . 33 occasions. Yesterday the familyâs solicitor, Jocelyn Cockburn, said . the family felt âlet downâ by the force and added: âNumerous police . failings were identified at the inquest and in the IPCC report. âIt is therefore hard for the Pilkington family to understand why no officer has been found guilty of misconduct. âPolice very rarely discipline . officers for misconduct and criminal charges are virtually never . brought. I invite the investigating officer to release to the family his . rationale in reaching this decision.â The bodies of Fiona Pilkington, 38, and her daughter Francesca Hardwick, 18, were discovered in a burnt out car The pair had suffered more than ten years of abuse at the hands of local youths in their Leicestershire . The forceâs deputy chief constable, . David Evans, said the misconduct hearings concluded that the mistakes . made in the case were âof an organisational nature due to the systems . and processes in place at the time not enabling officers to provide the . most effective serviceâ. He added: âThe tragic deaths of Fiona . and her daughter acted as a turning point for the force in how it . prioritised and dealt with anti-social behaviour, linking incidents and . identifying vulnerability.â The inquest into the deaths heavily . criticised both the force and the local council. It heard that none of . the 16-strong gang was ever prosecuted. At one point one yob told MissÂ  Pilkington: âWe can do anything we like to you and you canât do anything about it.â Mark Goldring, of the charity Mencap, . said it was âextremely shocking and disappointingâ that no oneÂ  has been . held accountable for the failure to protect Miss Pilkington and . Francecca. He said the deaths represented âa . complete failure in the policeâs ability to respond adequately to . disability hate crime victimsâ. And he called on the IPCC to reopen . the case to assess whether sufficient changes to policies and practices . have been made to prevent similar failures.","Youths had taunted the family for a decade, pelting their home with .

"By . Mark Duell . Last updated at 3:02 PM on 18th July 2011 . A judge has provoked fury by handing custody of a three-year-old girl to a registered sex offender. The ruling in Jacksonville, Florida, means little Miranda Wilkersonâs late motherâs husband, Donald Coleman, will gain custody of her. It means Miranda has to leave her maternal grandmother, Rita Manning, and move states to Georgia, where sex offender Mr Coleman lives. Stuck in the middle: Miranda Wilkerson is at the centre of a custody battle between her grandmother Rita Manning and sex offender father Donald Coleman . Mr Coleman became a sex offender after impregnating Mirandaâs mother, Trista Crews Coleman, with another baby. Ms Coleman died one month after Mirandaâs birth in a car crash, reported First Coast News. Ms Coleman was aged only 14 when she was first made pregnant, and he was 38. But he filed for divorce and claimed at one point she was pregnant with another manâs baby. However he is still Mirandaâs legal father because he was married to her mother when she was born, reported WJXX-TV and ABC News. Mr Coleman had pushed for custody because Ms Manning was not allowing him to see Miranda, court documents alleged. In another confusing twist, Ms Manning was charged with child neglect in 1997, when Mr Coleman got her daughter pregnant, reported WJXX-TV. But Ms Manning fumed about the judge's decision and the custody transfer last Wednesday, saying the girl's 'whole world is here' with her. Parents: Donald Coleman, who lives in Georgia, became a sex offender after he impregnated Miranda's late mother, Trista Crews, right, with another baby . Mr Coleman was sentenced to register as a sex offender but Ms Manning allowed him to marry Ms Coleman as she was expecting a baby. 'The only home, the only person this child she has ever known, she's being ripped away from to be put with a stranger' Adoption lawyer Michael Shorstein . The couple had two more children after she first got pregnant aged 14. Miranda grew up with her grandparents after Ms Coleman died - and her family claim Mr Coleman is not her father. State Representative Janet Adkins told WJXX-TV she is âabsolutely appalledâ by the case and âvery concernedâ for the girlâs well-being. Ms Adkins is now working with state family officials to work out if they can do anything to return Miranda to her grandparents. Don't go: Miranda's maternal grandmother, Rita Manning, will get the chance to appeal the judge's decision . âI find it absolutely incredible that the law would say you are going to take a child out of a family, the only family this child has ever known,â she said. 'I find it absolutely incredible that the law would say you are going to take a child out of a family, the only family this child has ever known' Florida Rep. Janet Adkins . Adoption lawyer Michael Shorstein told WJXX-TV that the family should have built a case against Mr Coleman before taking him on in court. âThe only home, the only person this child she has ever known, she's being ripped away from to be put with a stranger,â he said. Ms Manning will get the chance to appeal the judgeâs decision or report the case to the Department of Child and Family Services.","Donald Coleman gets custody of Miranda Wilkerson .

If Texas Governor Rick Perry . jumps into the Republican presidential contest, there has been at least one supporter pushing him to do so - his wife. After a meeting on state finances on Tuesday, the governor admitted for the first time his wife, Anita, has been encouraging him to run for the White House seat. The governor said: 'My wife was talking to me and saying: ""Listen... get out of your comfort zone. Yeah, being governor of Texas is a great job, but sometimes you'reÂ  called to step into the fray.""' Scroll down for video . Support: Texas Governor Rick Perry takes the oath of office as his wife, Anita and daughter, Sydney, look on during his inauguration on January 18, 2011 . Anita Perry has seen her share of the political spotlight, having first stepped out with her husband publicly before he was elected to the House of Representatives in 1985. Perry, who is flirting with . joining the 2012 race, has been travelling the country in recent years - . giving him a rapport with national Republicans. And as chairman of the . Republican Governors Association, he has ties to big party donors. Harvey Kronberg, who writes a report . on Texas politics, said: 'He's . got a pretty robust Rolodex.' He noted that Texas is one of the top money states . in the nation for Republicans. Perry told the Des Moines Register recently that he feels 'called' to run for the presidency and said he would make a decision within a few weeks. The three-term Texas governor reported $2.1million in contributions through a group called Texans for Rick Perry as of June 30, according to a Texas regulatory filing. Encouraging: Anita Perry has seen her share of the political spotlight, having first stepped out with her husband publicly during his race to the Texas House in 1984 . As governor, he has raised . $103million since 2001, with nearly half of that coming from big donors . giving $100,000 or more, according to Texans for Public Justice. During . the last cycle alone, he raised about $39 million. The funds cannot be used for a presidential run but is an indicator of his ability to garner support. A Republican fundraiser who has attended some of those meetings: 'He has held an amazing number of small group get-togethers in the key fundraising centers around the country.' Backers in June formed a California-based group called Americans for Rick Perry - which can raise unlimited funds. Former . Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney leads the money race among . Republicans, reporting a $18.4 million haul in the second quarter. But . less-than-robust fundraising on the Republican side suggests there is . room for another candidate. Campaign fundraising: Perry, as chairman of the Republican Governors Association, has ties to big party donors . There is significant Republican money sitting on the sidelines. The current crop of candidates have raised only a third of the more than $100 million raised at this time during the 2008 election cycle. Al Cardenas, president of the American Conservative Union, and former chairman of the Florida Republican Party, said: 'People are sitting on the fence. They don't want to risk a mistake,' that would get Obama re-elected. Some polls show Perry has some momentum going into the race, despite taking his time to decide. Peter Brown, assistant director of the Quinnipiac University Polling Institute, said: 'He's not even said he's running but he hits double digits.' Perry averages support of 11 per cent against potential rivals, according to a compilation of polls by Real Clear Politics, behind Romney and U.S. Representative Michele Bachmann, and slightly ahead of former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin. Promising figures: Perry averages support of 11 per cent according to an NBC poll - behind Massachusetts Gov Mitt Romney and Rep Michele Bachmann . A major donor to Perry is Texas homebuilder Bob Perry, of no relation, who has given $2.5million over about a decade. Governor Perry's biggest donor has been the Republican Governors Association political action committee. Bob Perry is a major funder of the national group American Crossroads, conceived in part by strategist Karl Rove, the former top White House adviser who also was an aide to George W Bush when he was Texas governor. Governor Perry has been president of the Republican Governors Association since November. After changes federal law changes put limits on donations, Perry helped lure Republican cash to the group, said Cleta Mitchell, a Republican election lawyer who has represented Tea Party favorite Representative Jim DeMint and many others. 'Many, many conservative donors who used to be big donors to the RNC (Republican National Committee) have gravitated to the RGA and Perry's been a big part of that,' Mitchell said. Any Republican presidential nominee faces a financial juggernaut in President Barack Obama and national Democrats, who raised $86million for his campaign in the second quarter. Jan Baran, former general counsel for the RNC, said: 'The president has a stronger fundraising base than any other candidate in this election or in history. Perry will have to demonstrate he has broad appeal to raise money.' Baran does not think Perry has done that yet. In addition, Texas allows unlimited donations, while running for president limits individuals to giving $2500 each for the general and the primary elections. In a state fundraising report filed on Friday, many donations blew past that limit. One donor gave $150,000 alone. Several gave $25,000. And Perry has not faced the harsh spotlight of an actual contender. A bad debate performance or a revelation about his record could depress support quickly. Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich suffered a collapse in backing after a series of missteps, for example. Watch video here .","Anita Perry encouraging husband to 'step into the fray'

To some, David Cameronâs presence at a party at Rebekah Brooksâ home last Christmas suggested power broking among the âChipping Norton Setâ. But according to fellow guest Jeremy Clarkson, the meatiest matter discussed by the Prime Minister and the former New International chief executive was sausage rolls.

Prime Minister David Cameron attended the party . Rebekah Brooks hosted the party with husband Charlie . Jeremy Clarkson has lifted the lid on the infamous gathering . Lifting the lid on the now infamous . gathering on Thursday, December 23 last year, Mr Clarkson wrote in his . Sunday Times column: âWhat Rebekah and Cameron talked about most of allâ¦ . is sausage rolls. âWe were planning a big walk with all our kids over Christmas and thought it might be a good idea to build a fire in my woods and stop off for a picnic. Rebekah was worried about what weâd eat. Cameron thought sausage rolls would be nice. My wife said sheâd get some.â The party is infamous because it took place days after Mr Cameron stripped Business Secretary Vince Cable, an avowed enemy of Rupert Murdoch, of his power to decide on Mr Murdochâs attempt to take full control of BSkyB. James Murdoch, left, was a guest at the Christmas party - 48 hours after Business Secretary Vince Cable, right, was stripped of his power to decide on Mr Murdoch's attempt to take full control of BSkyB .

Conservative Culture Secretary. Rupert Murdochâ s son James was also a guest as was Samantha Cameron. Clarkson, who attended the festive gathering with wife Francie, had the answer for anyone wondering if ""evil James Murdoch"" was ""to be found sticking pins into a waxwork model"" of Mr Cable. âNo, actually. James was sitting opposite me and we spent most of the night arguing about the environment,â the Top Gear presenter said. âHe likes it and I donât.â Heavyweight discussions: Clarkson said that Brooks and Cameron talked about getting sausage rolls for a family picnic .

Blur bassist, Alex James, also lives nearby, as does Ruby Wax and Kate Moss. Carphone Warehouse co-founder Charlie Dunstone is a stones throw away too. Entrepreneur Nick Jones, married to Desert Island Discs presenter Kirsty Young, last year paid Â£4âmillion for a nine-bedroom 17th-century pile in Oxfordshire. He adds that he felt 'desperately sad' that she had to resign - but said it almost meant he may see her more. Clarkson also poked fun at the notion of âamoralâ or âcorruptâ behaviour among his friends, adding: âThere is a group of Chipping Norton people who do live close to one another and who do meet up most weekends for wine and cheesy things on sticks. I am one of these people.

"By . Lucy Laing . Last updated at 4:01 PM on 17th July 2011 . When Nicola Watson greets her daughters each day after school, she always has a special smile for them. But the 42-year-old struggles to do little more - because since suffering from a brainstem stroke two years ago, she has been locked inside her own body in hospital. Daily visits: Emma (left) and Hannah (right) visit their mother Nicola each day after school along with their father Neil. They want to adapt their home so she can leave hospital . Although Mrs Watson can see, hear and think normally she can only communicate with her family with tiny movements of her head. The mother-of-two is almost completely paralysed and spells out words using a computer operated by a switch that she knocks against. Mrs Watson had been a busy working mother, juggling her job for the Ministry of Defence with caring for her husband and two daughters. But then in July 2009 she collapsed out of the blue at her family home in Carlisle. Neil Watson, who used to own his own garage door company until his wifeâs illness, said: âNicola had been complaining of a stiff neck for a few days, but apart from that there were no signs at all that she was unwell. âShe collapsed at the top of the stairs early one morning and she was taken straight to hospital. âShe was fun loving and absolutely lived life to the full before this happened. Now she is trapped in her own body.â Before the stroke: Mr Watson (pictured with Nicola a few years ago) had never heard of locked-in syndrome before his wife fell ill . Mrs Watson, who has two daughters Hannah, 13, and Emma, 11, had complained of a sore neck a few days before. Mr Watson said: âShe hadnât slept very well and she was meant to be going shopping to Newcastle with the girls and I said to her she should stay at home. âThat night I heard a noise. Nicola had got out of bed to go to the bathroom and she started calling me from the top of the stairs. âI rushed over to her and she was speaking in a slurred voice and I knew that something was seriously wrong.â Mr Watson called an ambulance which took his wife to Cumberland Infirmary, but she lost consciousness in the ambulance. She was put on a life support machine for ten weeks and spent the first four weeks in a semi-coma. Mr Watson said: âThey told us she had suffered a serious stroke which had affected her brain stem. âTests showed she had locked-in syndrome, which I had never heard of. When I knew what it was, it was devastating news. âNicola had always been such a lively person. She loved life and she loved being a mum more than anything. When the girls were born she was over the moon and she did so much with them. She would love taking them shopping and going to theme parks. âShe always put the girls before her - she was a fantastic mum. To see her lying there unable to move or speak was just heartbreaking.â Nicola, pictured before her stroke, has communicated to Neil that she is desperate to go back to their home in Carlisle . After she came off the life support machine, Mrs Watson was only able to communicate with her family by blinking. She would blink once for yes and two for no. Mr Watson said: âThat was the first time she was able to communicate with us. We would ask her questions and she would be able to blink for yes or no. âShe can remember everything - her mind hasnât been affected. She can even remember having the stroke. Her mind works perfectly, but she just canât move. It is so incredibly frustrating for her.â Mrs Watson then used an alphabet chart designed by her husband, where he traced the letters and she would blink at the right letter. She has now moved on to the adapted computer. Although if can take minutes to spell out each word it has helped Mrs Watson âtalkâ to her family. She can convey simple sentences and hopes to be able to move from the nursing home in Carlisle back to her family home, and the family are busy raising thousands of pounds to help this happen. Mr Watson said: âWe will have to make lots of adaptions to our family home, but we want Nicola to come home more than anything, and so does she. âWe never want to give up hope. Nicola tells us through the computer that she wants to come home more than anything.â Mrs Watsonâs daughters now visit her in the nursing home and spend time with their mother, putting on her makeup and doing her hair. Mr Watson said: âThe girls have been absolutely fantastic throughout all this and really keep Nicola going. âThey climb into bed with her to give her cuddles, and they do her hair and makeup for her, and even paint her fingernails for her. âThey are absolutely brilliant and Iâm so proud of them. They donât let it get them down, they just get on with helping their mum.â Locked-in syndrome is sometimes described as âlike being buried alive.â The most famous case was Jean-Dominique Bauby, the French journalist who could only communicate by blinking an eye. He wrote the book The Diving Bell and The Butterfly in 1997, which was adapted into a film 10 years later.

National Transitional Council forces claim to have punched their way into Libya's coastal city of Sirte, where Gaddafi was born. Truckloads of fighters are also hurtling towards Gaddafi's other last bastion of support, the desert enclave of Bani Walid.

Loyalists responded . with sniper attacks and rocket barrages. Smoke rose from parts of the city, where the green flags of Gaddafi's . regime flew from mosques and buildings. The Misrata Military Council, . which is leading the offensive, said anti-Gaddafi . forces had control of the old airport on the western edge.

Smoke rising: Fighting in the streets as anti-Gaddafi troops advanced nearer to Bani Walid city centre . The NTC had hesitated to storm the town in fear . of alienating a powerful local tribe, but earlier this week it told . civilians to flee ahead of a full-out onslaught. One fighter said today: 'We are going in. We finally have the orders. God is greatest. God willing, Bani Walid will be free today.' Another fighter, Hisham Nseir, said the frontline is 'very heated . and chaotic' and the troops were meeting with heavy resistance from . Gaddafi's men. Commander Abdullah Abu-Asara said his men were . just over a mile from the heart of Bani Walid, which . is ringed by mountains and only accessible through a valley . watched over by pro-Gaddafi marksmen.

A close adviser to Afghanistan's President Hamid Karzai has been killed by gunmen strapped with explosives. Jan Mohammed Khan, who assisted Karzai with tribal issues, as well as parliamentarian Mohammed Ashim Watanwal, were killed in the brazen late-night attack on Khan's home in western Kabul. Security forces quickly killed one of the assailants, but the second attacker barricaded himself inside the house and battled police outside. The crackle of gunfire and small explosions finally ended about 3 am on Monday morning and reporters on the scene saw a body - presumably that of the final attacker - dragged out of the house on a plastic sheet. One police officer also was killed, according to the Interior Ministry. The assassination threw a pall over two events marking the shift to the next phase of the Afghan conflict - the transfer of an entire province to Afghan security control on Sunday and Monday's transfer of authority for NATO and U.S. forces from Gen. David Petraeus to Lt. Gen. John Allen. The killing of Khan, which the Taliban claimed responsibility for, is the second high-profile assassination in Afghanistan in less than a week. Ahmed Wali Karzai, the president's half-brother and one of the most powerful men in southern Afghanistan, was gunned down last week by a close associate. The attack on Khan began Sunday evening when two men wearing suicide bomb vests and armed with guns knocked at a side door at Khan's home in western Kabul and then, when a man who worked at the house opened the gate, punched him and pushed past him into the residence, said Mohammad Yusuf, the man who opened the door. 'Then the shooting started,' Yusuf said. It was not immediately clear whether there had been armed guards outside the door. A relative who was inside the house said the attackers went straight for the room where Khan and Watanwal, a lawmaker from Uruzgan province, were talking. Afghan police keep watch outside the house where the attack began to unfold on Sunday evening . The body of a Taliban insurgent is driven away from the scene of the assassination . 'They went in there with their guns and started shooting and just killed them,' said Najibullah, a young man who spoke through tears and only gave one name. Defence department officials confirmed the deaths. Khan was governor of the Pashtun-dominated Uruzgan province in the south from 2002 until March 2006 and has remained influential in the area. Though he was often labeled a warlord and a thug by the international community, presidential spokesman Waheed Omar said Karzai considered him a key partner in the south and a bulwark against the Taliban. 'Jan Mohammed Khan was one of the most influential leaders in the south, especially in Uruzgan,' Omar said. As an example of Karzai's trust in Khan, Omar explained a tribal dispute the adviser helped calm. Broken windows bear evidence of the gun battle which killed the two men . 'Only two months ago, Jan Mohammed Khan resolved a huge dispute between the Hazaras in Uruzgan and one of the Pashtun tribes. The president said, 'Jan Mohammed Khan was the only one who can resolve that problem because both sides respect him,'' Omar recalled. He said Karzai would not have removed Khan as governor except for pressure from the international community, which wrongly accused him of criminal activity. 'He was one of the most hard-line opponents and enemies of the Taliban,' Omar said.It was unclear how influential Khan was with Karzai, but he was thought to wield considerable influence in Uruzgan. Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid claimed responsibility for the attack on behalf of the insurgent group. Ahmed Wali Karzai (left) was killed in a gun attack last week. He was the half-brother of President Hamid Karzai (right) Mujahid said the Taliban killed Khan because he was assisting coalition forces in carrying out night raids against Afghans. The controversial raids have been highly effective in capturing or killing hundreds of Taliban fighters and midlevel commanders. Karzai has complained the operations anger many Afghans who are mistakenly targeted. 'He was cooperating and helping the American forces,' Mujahid said in an emailed statement. The Taliban had also claimed responsibility for Tuesday's killing of Karzai's half-brother, who was shot dead by a close associate. Wali Karzai's death left the president without an influential ally to balance the interests of the southern region's tribal and political leaders, drug runners, insurgents and militias. Sunday's violence marred the handover of control of a peaceful province in the center of the country to Afghan police, another step in a transition that will allow foreign troops to withdraw in full by the end of 2014. The weeping President, centre, attends the burial of his half- brother in his family's ancestral village of Karz, in Kandahar province, Afghanistan, last week . Bamiyan province is one of seven areas going to Afghan security control this month in a first round of the transition. Another, Panjshir province in the east, began being transferred earlier this month. Both places have seen little to no fighting since the overthrow of the Taliban nearly 10 years ago and barely had any coalition troop presence. Bamiyan only had a small foreign troop contingent from New Zealand. Bamiyan and Panjshir are the only two provinces that will be handed over in their entirety during this month's transition phase. Other areas to be handed over are the provincial capitals of Lashkar Gah in southern Afghanistan, Herat in the west, Mazer-e-Sharif in the north and Mehterlam in the east. Afghan forces will also take control of all of Kabul province except for the restive Surobi district. But recent attacks in the capital have served as a reminder of how much Afghan forces still depend on international help in Kabul. New Zealand special forces were called in to help with Sunday night's attack, New Zealand Prime Minister John Key said in a press conference Monday. He said the New Zealand troops began in a mentoring role but then shifted into an 'operational' combat role as the attack unfolded. Key declined to give further details of what happened. It's the second time in three weeks that the New Zealand Special Air Service group (SAS), which is in Afghanistan primarily to mentor Afghan security forces, has become actively involved in active combat. The SAS was also involved in countering insurgents who attacked the Inter-Continental Hotel in Kabul on June 29.","Attack comes one week after President's brother was gunned down .

That search led to sci-spot.com, also visited once, which gave information on the use of the chemical in the 1800s.

Suspicious, and also concerned a woman's life was at risk - Anthony faced the death penalty if convicted - Mr Bradley redesigned his software to check the police data. He found both reports inaccurate - although NetAnalysis had arrived at the correct result. Both types of software had failed to . fully decode the entire search file. Where is she? Anthony was released from jail last week and could have fled to Carlsbad, California, according to reports . Roll up, roll up for your chance to dunk Casey Anthony, or at least someone who looks vaguely like her. It may be poor taste but organisers at the annual Bluegrass Fair in Kentucky have set up an Anthony-themed dunking booth right at the front of the showground. For a fee, fair goers can choose whether Anthony is guilty or not guilty - despite the fact she has already been acquitted of murdering her two-year-old daughter Caylee. The participant then hurls a ball at his chosen target and, if he gets a direct hit, the woman sitting behind bars heckling the crowd is plunged into water. 'We're hoping that it's taken in a fun way so that people coming out can release some of their frustrations about what just happened in the last few months and they can show their opinion,' fair organiser Michael Kaplan told WKYT News. Watch the video below... After going through everything . again Mr Bradley found sci-spot.com was visited just once. Mr . Bradley said he immediately contacted prosecutor, Linda Drane Burdick, . and Sgt Kevin Stenger of the Sheriffâs Office in late June via email and . by phone to tell them of the mistake. Sergeant Stenger said he was aware of the discrepancy, according to Mr Bradley. 'I gave the police everything they needed to present a new report,' Mr Bradley said. 'I did the work myself and copied out the entire database in a spreadsheet to make sure there was no issue of accessibility to the data.' He even offered to fly to Orlando at his own expense to go through the findings. Despite Anthony being cleared of murder, the revelations have angered her defence. Defence lawyer Cheney Mason told the Times it was 'outrageous' that prosecutors withheld critical information on the 'chloroform' searches. 'The prosecution is absolutely obligated to bring forth to the court any and all evidence that could be exculpatory,' Mr Mason said. 'If in fact this is true, and the prosecution concealed this new information, it is more than shame on them. It is outrageous.' 'This was a major part of their case,' Mr Mason added. Spokesman for the Orange County Sheriff's Office, Captain Angelo Nieves, hit back at the claims saying Mr Bradley had a vested interest in coming forward because his software was used. 'Weâre not going to relive the trial again,' Captain Nieves said. 'We are not prepared to do that nor are we going to participate in that.' The State Attorneyâs Office in Orlando did not immediately return a call for comment. Anthony was released from the Florida jail she has been in for the past three years last Sunday and hasn't been seen since. However she may have fled to Carlsbad, California, according to the Today Show. The private Pilatus PC-12 jet Anthony was whisked away on that morning is owned by California attorney Todd Macaluso's firm, according to the news programme. Macaluso had, at one point, been a member of Anthony's defence team and had given her $70,000. The firm has an office at the Palomar Airport in Carlsbad. The plane 'enables us to travel anywhere within the United States in seven hours,' according to the company's website.","Designer John Bradley discovered the discrepancy and 'alerted prosecution'

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 9:19 AM on 20th July 2011 . The latest victim of the intense heatwave that is crippling the country is the nation's concrete. There are grave concerns that sidewalks and roads in cities across the U.S. may start exploding under the sweltering and persistent heat, which has claimed the lives of at least 13 people. The country-wide heat wave coupled with stifling . humidity intensified in the mid-section of the country today, with . forecasters warning of at least six more days of 100-plus degree . temperatures for many areas. The news came as it emerged over 1000 heat records have been broken in the past month. Now a Public Works Director is saying that the water and heat on the concrete could cause it to actually explode. Des Moines Public Works Director Bill Stowe says that water trapped either below the concrete or inside it can actually explode, causing the concrete to break wide open. This only happens in concrete and not asphalt. The central US states experiencing temperatures and humidity indices above 37.7C with even worse weather predicted in some areas by Thursday.

Sweltering: Baseball fans stand in the mist of fountains during 100 degree weather at Kauffman Stadium before a baseball game between the Kansas City Royals and the Chicago White Sox . Bearing it: A grizzly bear at Henry Vilas Zoo dries off after taking a dip in the water to relieve himself of the scorching temperatures today . Forecasters said high pressure in the upper atmosphere ensured that the . searing weather would remain in place in the heartland for days on end, . but would not spare the eastern United States. The US east coast already on Tuesday was beginning to feel the effects . of the oppressive weather, which was expected to reach New York, . Washington DC and the rest of the eastern seaboard full force by . midweek, according to NOAA. Pat Slattery, spokesman for the weather service, said: 'This is unusual. There's no sugar coating anything here.' Temperatures in places such as Dodge City, Kansas, Wichita, Kansas, and Woodward, Oklahoma, were forecast to be above 100 degrees up to and including Sunday. This heat wave is particularly dangerous because many of the areas under its umbrella are not used to prolonged high temperatures and humidity, according to the weather service. Cities are opening cooling centres, park districts are offering discounts on pool passes and Chicago Public Schools officials are distributing fans to summer-school classrooms that lack air conditioning. Residents are encouraged to check on neighbours and family members, especially the elderly or disabled. Chicago officials opened six cooling centres and hundreds of air-conditioned public buildings - including libraries, park facilities and police stations - and are conducting well-being checks on the elderly and disabled. Respite: A man soaks his feet in a fountain while reading a magazine on the Rose Kennedy Greenway on a warm summer afternoon . The region's hazy, hot and humid conditions weren't expected to ease any time soon, with forecasters expecting temperatures in the upper 90s or low 100s through the rest of the week, pushing the heat index - a combination of heat and humidity - consistently into triple digits. The main concern is that temperatures are expected to exceed 90 degrees every day through Saturday, said National Weather Service meteorologist Stephen Rodriguez. 'The extended nature of this definitely is going to be significant,' he said. 'When you see day after day of (high) heat index values, it can be exhausting on the body.' Wait: A broad ridge of high pressure slowly advances eastward from the Plains, bringing hot and muggy conditions to the Eastern US . Danger on the roads: Emergency workers on the Belle Isle bridge in Oklahoma City on Monday after the heat caused an expansion joint to buckle . The heat caused parts of roads and bridges to buckle across central Oklahoma. Two lanes on the Interstate 44 had to be closed for emergency bridge repairs when a steel expansion joint buckled under the heat. Parts of the joint had risen above the buckled concrete on the Belle Isle bridge and several cars were damaged before emergency crews arrived. Warning: A message advising people to limit outdoor activity is displayed on an electronic street sign on the R.L. Thornton Freeway during a prolonged heat wave in Dallas . That feels good: Young boys cool down under a fountain in St. Louis, Missouri . Plus the overnight temperatures are not expected to dip low enough to provide any reprieve. 'The cumulative effects, when it doesn't cool down overnight, is that you get no relief,' Mr Slattery said. According to the weather service outlook, the central United States from North Dakota to Texas and east to the Carolinas, excluding parts of the Northeast and Southern Florida, will see excessive heat right through to July 29. In Chicago, Monday was the hottest day in five years with the heat index hitting 105 degrees. Cool down: Heather White of New York lays down next to the fountains at Columbus Circle . Scorcher: A searing heatwave brought summer misery to the American heartland, enveloping as many as 17 US states in oppressive temperatures and humidity likely to persist into next week . A heat advisory is in effect in Chicago from from 11am to 8pm, with temperatures expected to rise in the mid 90s. the National Weather Service warned that it expected a heat index of 105 degrees on Wednesday and Thursday as well. Since 1990, it has been 'quite rare' for the heat index to reach that mark, the weather service said. 'There have only been 31 days where the heat index officially reached 105 degrees at O'Hare International Airport,' the weather service said in a statement. Drought victims: Abandoned fawns are being taken in at animal shelters across the country as their mothers are unable to feed them . Staying close to the water: Families have been flocking to the beaches in a bid to keep cool . Two people died when their 35ft sailboat capsized in a storm on Lake Michigan, the Coast Guard said on Monday. Six crew members were pulled from the lake by another boat competing in the annual Race to Mackinac. The midnight storm generated waves up to 6ft and WingNuts, a boat registered out of Saginaw, Michigan, capsized and issued a distress signal. The victims were WingNuts captain Mark Morley, 51, and Suzanne Bickel, 41, both of Saginaw. Morley had 44 years of sailing experience, including six Mackinac races. The storm produced torrential rains, high winds, and sheet lightning, Reuters reports. The 333-mile race from Chicago to Mackinac Island, Michigan, is billed as the world's oldest fresh water race, which began in 1898. 'To find the last hourly observation with a heat index of at least 105 in Chicago, one would have to look back to 6pm on August 2, 2006. Severe thunderstorms packing large hail and damaging winds could hit northern Illinois and the Chicago area later on Monday. The chance of thunderstorms and showers is 40 per cent, according to the weather service. July is typically the hottest month in the area. About 37 per cent of the nearly 3,000 days in which temperatures reached 90 degrees in Chicago from 1928 through last year were in July, more than any other month, according to data analysed by WGN-TV meteorologists. And the heat wave by which all other hot spells are measured remains the deadly July 1995 stretch that killed more than 700 area residents. Forecasters said temperatures this week are unlikely to match those conditions, and no deaths were reported in the current heat wave as of Sunday. The extreme heat and persistent drought seen in much of Texas is taking its toll on wildlife, with deer, birds and other animals abandoning their young because they areÂ  unable to feed them. Drought-induced malnutrition is robbing of their ability to produce milk. Abandoned fawns found all over the Panhandle and South Plains have been brought to the South Plains Wildlife Rehabilitation Center. Ten had been brought to the Lubbock wildlife center by the end of last week. 'With the drought, there is no feed for the mother deer. And if they can't feed, they can't produce milk,' said centre volunteer Gail Barnes. 'They can't feed their babies, so they are leaving them.'

No respite: Thursday's picture offers little comfort for those wishing for a break from the heat . In the St. Louis area of Missouri, even the night air was too stifling for some in the crowd of around 50,000 fans at a U2 concert. Brian Walsh, deputy St. Louis fire chief, said 136 concert-goers were treated for heat-related issues, with seven ending up in the hospital. He said most of those cases involved alcohol.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 4:28 AM on 20th July 2011 . Stress: Former aides say Bachmann may not be able to handle the stress of the campaign alone . Rep. Michele Bachmann suffers debilitating pain episodes that have landed her in hospital and call into question whether she could withstand the rigours of a campaign and the stress of serving as president. Former aides of the Tea Party darling claim that she becomes 'incapacitated' by the stress-induced episodes that she has characterized as severe headaches. The Daily Caller website, who quotes three former aides, said that on at least three occasions, Bachmann has landed in hospital as a result of these episodes. But Bachmann released a statement today admitting that she suffers from migraines 'like nearly 30 million other Americans' but vehemently denied that they have ever caused her to function ineffectively. When repeatedly questioned about the migraines at a press conference today, the 55-year-old ignored the journalist, who is then said to have been 'roughed up' by her security guards. In late July 2010, her communications . director Dave Dziok told his boss that he planned to take a new job . with a public relations firm. Dziok had worked for Bachmann for two-and-a-half years and was leaving on good terms. Staff turnover can frustrate any employer, but Bachmann responded more dramatically. Dziokâs . departure triggered a debilitating medical episode that landed the . congresswoman in urgent care, the Daily Caller reports. A former aide said: 'Within 24 hours she was in the hospital. Mrs Bachmann was admitted to a Washington D.C. hospital on Friday, July 30, and released that same day. She flew home to Minnesota to recuperate, missing a scheduled campaign event. Without specifying why Mrs Bachmann had been hospitalized, Mr Dziok said at the time: 'Itâs nothing folks should worry about going forward.' It was, according to the Daily Caller's three sources, not an isolated event. Packed schedule: Bachmann spoke with supporters after a political rally today, in South Carolina where she also appeared at a Christian Chamber of Commerce event . Concentration: The Republican presidential candidate and South Carolina Christian Chamber of Commerce member Bruce Snell pray together. Bachmann's ability to act as president has been called into question over health fears . The Minnesota Republican's stress-induced episodes occur once a week on average and can 'incapacitate' her for days at a time, they say. But in a statement released today, the presidential candidate said: 'Let me be abundantly clear - my ability to function effectively has never been impeded by migraines and will not affect my ability to serve as Commander in Chief. 'As a presidential candidate and office holder, I am focused on performing my job, which has never been more important given the state of our economy and the millions of Americans that are out of work. 'While I appreciate the concern for me and my health, the greater concern should be the debate that is occurring in Washington over whether or not we will increase our debt, spending and taxes.' At a rally in South Carolina earlier, ABC investigative reporter Brian Ross repeatedly asked her whether her migraines ever made her miss a House vote. When she refused to answer, he dashed after her and followed her into a parking area where her SUV was waiting. When Bachmann's bodyguards spotted him they 'pounced on him, grabbing and pushing him multiple times with what looked like unusual force' according to Time's reporter Michael Crowley who said he witnessed the event. Mr Crowley said: 'I have never seen a reporter treated so roughly at a campaign event, especially not a presidential one.' Another adviser to Bachmann, who was involved in her 2010 congressional campaign, said of her headaches: 'She has terrible migraine headaches. And they put her out of commission for a day or more at a time. They come out of nowhere, and theyâre unpredictable. 'They level her. They put her down. Itâs actually sad. Itâs very painful.' Some close to Mrs Bachmann fear she wonât be to handle to the stress of the campaign, let alone the presidency. The adviser said: 'When she gets âem, frankly, she canât function at all. Itâs not like a little thing with a couple Advils. Itâs bad. 'The migraines are so bad and so intense, she carries and takes all sorts of pills. 'Prevention pills. Pills during the migraine. Pills after the migraine, to keep them under control. She has to take these pills wherever she goes.' To staff, Mrs Bachmann has implausibly blamed the headaches on uncomfortable high-heel shoes, but those who have worked closely with her cite stress, a busy schedule and anything going badly for Mrs Bachmann as causes. Up and down: Bachmann salutes the crowd on Tuesday before a political rally in Aiken, South Carolina . Concerns: Aides say the Minnesota Republican's stress-induced episodes occur once a week on average and can 'incapacitate' her for days at a time . On the evening of May 13, 2010, Mrs Bachmann flew to Los Angeles for a series of political and fundraising events. In part because of complications with her flight schedule, Mrs Bachmannâs mood plunged. During the entire six-hour flight, she was sick from headaches. Her husband Marcus Bachmann met her at the airport and took her to a nearby urgent care centre. Though Mrs Bachmann managed to attend several events in California, but she struggled through the weekend and was in pain throughout, according to a source. On October 19, 2010, Mrs Bachmann fell apart at a Greenwich, Conn., fundraiser at the home of Craig Stevenson, CEO of Diamond S Shipping. She was put in a bed at Stevensonâs home and later checked into an urgent care facility near LaGuardia Airport, the source said. Back in February 2006, Mrs Bachmann checked into a hospital for what a press release called 'an appendicitis attack,' according to an archive of her website. Quick change: Friends are worried she will not be able to withstand the gruelling schedule of her campaign let alone the presidency . 'Michele felt very well immediately after the surgery but then suffered from complications, including nausea and intense migraines,' the press release reads. Of particular concern to some around her is the significant amount of medication Bachmann allegedly takes to address her condition. The former aide alleges that Bachmannâs congressional staff is 'constantly' in contact with her doctors to tweak the types and amounts of medicine she is taking. Marcus Bachmann helps her manage the episodes. The sources spoke out because they're terrified about the impact the condition could have on Mr Bachmannâs performance if she actually became president, the website says. They also worry that the issue could blow up in the general election campaign, giving President Obama an easy path to re-election. Mrs Bachmann's released . Miss Stewart refused to discuss Bachmann's medical history in detail. But she says Bachmann has been campaigning intensely for more than a month in 'stressful, hot' conditions without incident. Miss Stewart says Mrs Bachmann's migraines are treated successfully with medication.","She takes lots of pills, former aides allege .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 12:30 PM on 19th July 2011 . Veteran broadcaster Stuart Hall says Jeremy Clarkson is 'deluded' for claiming he would rather quit Top Gear than move north with the BBC. Clarkson, 51, described Salford as 'a small suburb with little to offer beyond a Starbucks and a canal with ducks'. He added: 'Every year weâd end up making a Christmas special from the Dog and Duck or the nearest Arndale Centre.' Quit threat: Stuart Hall (right) has branded Jeremy Clarkson deluded after the Top Gear host said he would 'quit in a heartbeat' if asked to relocate to Manchester . The BBC is moving five departments to Salford Quays from London, but has no plans to relocate the Top Gear team. Former Itâs A Knockout presenter Hall, 81, wrote in the Radio Times: âClarkson is deluded. Does he imagine that at the advance of effete southerners, we retreat to our outside lavatories with ripped-up copies of the News of the Screws? âThat in our back-to-back terraces we ply Uncle Fred with chitterlings, chunks, bangers and chips, sit him in a commode, chamberpot handy, an ashtray full of dog ends, a basketful of empty tinnies and pretend heâs dying through lack of care?â BBC sports commentator Hall, born in Ashton-under-Lyne, Lancashire, added: âManchester is booming, the financial sector deals with the world. 'Our scientists lead. Manchester is a seat of knowledge, a breeding ground for brains.â He added that Salford's Media City will be a 'haven for the creative mind, far from London's overcrowded, cosmopolitan fever heat and crush.' Controversial: 1,500 jobs are to move from London to the corporation's new Â£877million headquarters . Clarkson has claimed that the BBC's move to Salford is a 'box-ticking exercise', writing in a newspaper column earlier this year: 'A lof of the arguments against the BBC's move have been centred on expense, but I believe there's a more important problem than money. 'In short, Salford is up north.' Several high-profile BBC presenters have so far refused to make the move to Manchester, including BBC Breakfast co-host Sian Williams and Chris Hollins, the sports presenter.",Veteran broadcaster says Clarkson's view of Manchester is 'outdated'
"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 11:58 AM on 19th July 2011 . An unemployed man who grabbed Â£25,000 from a security guard because he could not afford a birthday card for his wife has been jailed for 26 months. Richard Blake, 36, wanted to 'make a quick buck' when he realised he only had 63p to celebrate with his partner of 13 years. Blake, who had been out of work for a month, robbed a cash-in-transit guard as he delivered funds to a branch of Lloyds TSB in Sydenham, south London. Richard Blake robbed a cash-in-transit guard as he delivered funds to a branch of Lloyds TSB in Sydenham, south London, not pictured . He grabbed a cashbox from the unsuspecting guard, who had been delayed from entering the bank as he had let an elderly woman customer through the door in Sydenham Road. No violence was used and he was able to flee the scene on foot. Blake carried out the robbery on his wife Heather's birthday, at 11.40am on January 25 this year. He then called his friend Clement Benjamin, 41, to pick him up. Benjamin then used an angle grinder to force open the box in his back garden in Croydon, but only managed to cover himself and the cash in purple dye. Blake was arrested later that afternoon after neighbours had witnessed suspicious activity in and around Benjamin's home. Benjamin, a plumber and qualified gas engineer, was picked up when he rang Blake's mobile during the arrest. Blake pleaded guilty to robbery on what was due to be the first day of a trial at the Old Bailey. Jailing him, the Recorder of London, Judge Peter Beaumont QC: 'Those who deliver cash to banks undertake a risky job and deserve the support of the court when they are attacked. Richard Blake pleaded guilty to robbery on what was due to be the first day of a trial at the Old Bailey, pictured . 'The only way that support can be given in real terms is by imposing a custodial sentence.' Benjamin, who told officers in interview 'greed got the better of me', admitted assisting an offender and was jailed for six months. Manisha Knights, defending, said Blake had become 'frustrated at numerous attempts to secure work' in January after finishing a year of temporary contracts through an agency in December. He has previously worked in customer services at both the Glades shopping centre in Bromley and Lakeside in Essex. She said Blake, who has a seven-year-old son with his wife, was so ashamed that he could not afford anything for her that he committed the 'impulsive offence'. 'He put himself in a position where he saw the cash in transit custodian and saw an opportunity to make a quick buck and he took it,' said Miss Knights. 'He had been unable to find work. He started to panic regarding his finances. On the day he had greeted his wife and wished her a happy birthday. He had 63p to his name and felt ashamed he could not even buy her a card that day. 'He is extremely ashamed and embarrassed by his actions.' Blake, the eldest of three brothers who also has another child from a previous relationship, has left his wife struggling to cope with a full-time job as a catering assistant in Croydon, childcare and the family finances, it was said. Benjamin, who has two children and a long-term partner, has repeatedly run in to trouble for driving while disqualified. Blake, of Penge, southeast London, has served six months on remand. He will be released on licence after completing half of his 26-month sentence. Benjamin, of Croydon, will serve three months of his six-month term before being released.",Richard Blake was jailed for 26 months .
