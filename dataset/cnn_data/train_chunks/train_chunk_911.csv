"By . Dominic King . Follow @@DominicKing_DM . Jurgen Klopp has tipped Liverpool to follow Borussia Dortmund's blueprint and emerge as one of the key forces in Europe this season. While the enigmatic Klopp was relaxed about seeing his side beaten 4-0 by Liverpool on Sunday, he was quick to recognise that Brendan Rodgers' side have the potential to be a threat to all with their slick passing and speed on the counterattack. He also sees parallels between Dortmund and the situation Liverpool have found themselves this summer: in the past 16 months, Klopp has seen his key players Mario Goetze and Robert Lewandowski cherry-picked by Bayern Munich, while Liverpool have lost Luis Suarez to Barcelona. VIDEO Scroll down for Jose Enrique: Liverpool have replace Suarez with quality players . In form: Liverpool thrashed Borussia Dortmund 4-0 in a friendly at Anfield on Sunday . Tucked away: Jordan Henderson was on the scoresheet during the comprehensive victory . But Klopp still believes Liverpool showed enough in a performance that delighted Brendan Rodgers they can make a mark even without their talisman and feels they can be a 'big team' in the race for major honours. When asked about Suarez's departure, Klopp said: 'It seems to be no problem! They have a plan maybe but I don't know. We can play better than that and Liverpool can play better too. 'Liverpool is a great club and they did well last year. I saw it. If you make the right decisions after you miss (a trophy) you can be stronger. Maybe Liverpool this year is the big team in the Premier League. We will see. 'We are only the middle of our preparations and on Wednesday we have the other match against Bayern Munich in the Super Cup. Our problem at the moment is not (missing) Lewandowski. The players all start at different moments and this was not the ideal time to face Liverpool.' Praise: Jurgen Klopp has backed Liverpool to follow Dortmund and be a force in Europe .

Rodgers described Klopp as 'an inspiration' in his programme notes and Dortmund's manager can see some of the way his side have developed in how Liverpool have progressed under the Northern Irishman. 'We did what we did, when we started we tried to create football moments that will hopefully be more successful than the past,' said Klopp. 'We didn't think about what happened in the past, just how we can develop the team. That's what we do at the time. 'He's a good manager but I don't think about things like this. He does his job and I do mine.' Klopp, meanwhile, has confirmed there is no possibility of Mats Hummels – who has just been named Dortmund captain – joining Manchester United this summer.

"By . Wills Robinson . A computer engineer who admitted causing the death of a woman when he ploughed a £100,000 Audi R8 Spyder into her sister's car was 'showing off', it emerged today. Saqib Hussain, 24, was speeding in the supercar when he slammed into a Ford Fiesta as Noreen Ryan and her sister Mary returned from a family member's 16th birthday party in Hall Green, Birmingham, last August. Noreen, 49, was killed in the horrific crash, while driver Mary, 60, suffered a punctured lung, broken pelvis, broken ribs and a chipped spine. Hussain pleaded guilty to causing death by dangerous driving, but Noreen's relatives revealed that he already had a speeding conviction to his name. Scroll down for video . Victim: Computer Engineer Saqib Hussain, 24 (right) has been told that prison is 'inevitable' after he admitted causing 49-year-old Noreen Ryan's death by dangerous driving . Horror crash: Norren died and her sister Mary was seriously injured after the hired Audi R8 Spyder slammed into them as they made their way back from a family birthday in Halls Green, Birmingham . Hussain initially fled the scene but was arrested when he handed himself in at a police station later the same night. And he pleaded guilty to causing death by dangerous driving and whilst uninsured when he appeared at Birmingham Crown Court yesterday. Hussain, from Acocks Green, Birmingham, also admitted causing serious injury to two other people, including the passenger of his car, by dangerous driving and failing to stop after a collision. Judge Melbourne Inman QC bailed Hussain and banned him from driving until his sentencing on September 15. He told him: 'You must understand that for the gravity of this offence a prison sentence is inevitable.' Prosecutor Joanne Barker told the court Hussain wouldn't have ploughed into and killed Noreen if he had not been speeding. She said: 'It is not the prosecution case he was racing with the Mercedes vehicle behind. The prosecution would submit he may well have been showing off. 'He did not adjust his speed despite seeing her. He was going too fast to do anything about it. The collision would not have occurred if he had not been travelling at the speed he was.' Deadly collision: A police officer inspects the scene in the aftermath of the crash in August last year . Speaking outside court, Noreen's brother Chris Ryan said: 'It has been a very difficult time for the family and the whole experience in court was awful. 'It has already been revealed in court that he has been convicted of speeding before. It is ludicrous that he has been driving right up until the court appearance this week. 'There will not be any justice whatever happens. It is not going to bring her back.' Mr Ryan said she had been her 'usual lovely and bubbly self' at the birthday party earlier that night. 'She and Mary left at around 11.10pm with some birthday cake on Noreen's lap and dropped off my mother on the way back. That was the last time we saw her,' he added. Birmingham City football fan Noreen lived on her own in Kings Norton, Birmingham, but was devoted to her grandchildren and her former partner's children. Horrific: Reports suggest Noreen was holding a piece of birthday cake on her lap at the time of the crash . A family tribute to Noreen, the youngest of her seven brothers and sisters, described her as the 'heart, spark and soul' of her family. It said: 'Birmingham City was Noreen's passion in life and she was a season ticket holder who never missed a match. 'But her family was also very important to her and she was a much-loved stepmother, step grandmother, daughter, sister and aunty to her nieces and nephews. 'Noreen was the heart, spark and soul of her family. She was over-generous and loved buying presents at Christmas and birthdays. 'She enjoyed a glass of prosecco with the girls and had a great sense of humour and some fantastic one-liners. 'She had watched all of Birmingham City's home matches with her brother John since they were kids. She always had the last word on football debates.' Crime scene: Debris was thrown all over the road during the crash which occurred as the sisters returned home from her niece's 16th birthday party . Judge Melbourne Inman QC allowed Hussain bail but told him: 'You must understand that for the gravity of this offence a prison sentence is inevitable.' He also imposed a driving ban on the defendant. Previously Noreen’s sister-in-law, Maria Ryan, paid tribute to the 49-year-old, from a family of eight. She said: 'They had been at our home in Solihull on the night of the crash to celebrate our daughter Gemma’s birthday. She had been her usual lovely and bubbly self. 'She and Mary left at around 11.10pm with some birthday cake on Noreen’s lap and dropped off my mother on the way back. That was the last time we saw her.'","Noreen Ryan and sister Mary were hit by the car in Hall Green, Birmingham .

"By . Ashley Collman For Mailonline . A 31-year-old biology teacher planned to murder his wife in order to be with the 17-year-old student he was having an affair with, according to court documents. Ethan Richard Estevez, a former teacher at the Center for Educational Opportunity School in Aberdeen, Maryland, was charged last week with the attempted first degree murder of his unnamed wife. The charges come just two months after Estevez was fired from the Hartford County alternative school for having sex with a 17-year-old female student. Dangerous affair: A teacher who taught at the Center for Educational Opportunity School (pictured) in Aberdeen, Maryland has been charged with plotting to kill his wife in order to be with a 17-year-old student . According to text message conversations detectives obtained from the unidentified student, the two were planing to kill Estevez's wife as far back as a February, the Baltimore Sun reports. In a message to an unidentified person, the student writes: 'Like it has to look like an accident because of life insurance and stuff and she works at mid atlantic medical monday and thursday from 7:30 to 4:30'. The girl later wrote that she would 'just needed it to really happen before [Sunday]' in another message. Last month, a person who corresponded with the student came forward to detail Estevez's murder plot. According to the source, Estevez wanted someone to drive by in a dark vehicle and shoot his wife dead and also hit him in the shoulder so the attack would look more random. When the student was later interviewed by detectives, she said she 'really was not gonna kill' Estevez's wife and just thought the idea was a joke. Estevez was suspended from teaching in March after it was revealed he was having an affair with the student in question. The teacher came under investigation when the student started telling her friends about the relationship and another teacher became suspicious. Betrayal: Above, the house Estevez and his wife shared in Bel Air, Maryland according to public records . In March, the girl's mother called Estevez and the conversation was recorded by local authorities. In the call, Estevez said he loved her daughter and wanted to marry her. He said the two did not have sex but admitted to kissing her. A month later, the two were still exchanging text messages when the student's phone was seized, and in one message Estevez allegedly admitted to having sex with the minor. He has since been indicted on charges of sex abuse of a minor and fourth-degree sex offense. The student victim is only listed by her initials in documents for both cases. The judge who proceeded over Estevez's bail hearing last Friday said he 'cannot ignore the seriousness of the charge'. 'It's about as serious as it gets, but he is entitled to some bail, I believe,' Hartford County District Court Judge David Carey said. Estevez's parents were in the courtroom for the hearing and he was released on $75,000 bond. 'He intends to vigorously defend against the allegations,' Estevez's lawyer Karen Jones said. Estevez formerly worked in the Hartford County's alternative education school which helps students 'who may have experienced crisis' in grades seven to 12. According to a school spokesman, he was hired in August 2012, placed on administrative leave in March 2014, and fired last June.","Ethan Richard Estevez, 31, charged last week with planning to kill his wife .

Pictured holding the flag outside his home today, Mark Dunaway, of Garwood, says he's been flying the it most Fridays and during the holy month of Ramadan for 10 years - long before ISIS militants adopted the symbol as their own. For Dunaway, the flag — which says in Arabic, 'There is only one god, Allah, and the prophet Muhammad is his messenger' — is just a symbol of his faith. Scroll down for video . Mark Dunaway, of Garwood, says he's been flying the flag most Fridays and during the holy month of Ramadan for 10 years, since long before ISIS militants adopted the symbol as their own . Mr Dunaway has been flying this flag outside his Garwood, New Jersey, home for years. His neighbors recently noticed it and thought Dunaway was supporting ISIS jihadists . 'Every Muslim uses that black flag,' Dunway, 44, told NJ.com. 'You'll find it in any mosque in world. 'I am an American citizen and I love my country,  but I am also a Muslim and I use that flag to say I’m a Muslim.' The controversy began on Tuesday when investment manager Marc Leibowitz tweeted a photo of the flag and commented: 'Scary!' 'Every Muslim uses that black flag,' said Dunway, 44. 'You'll find it in any mosque in world' 'Jihadists are now in Garwood,' wrote one commenter on the photo. 'I think it's not right at this time to be flying that type of flag,' local resident James McHugh told News 12. 'Especially with what's going on at this time.' Neighbor Diana Figueiredo says Dunaway and his flag are harmless - but she does worry about the people making a stink out of the situation. 'He goes to work every day, he never bothers anyone, he keeps to . himself,' she told NJ.com. 'I'm more . concerned about the crazy people saying they're going to retaliate and . set his house on fire,' she added. 'They're the extremists.' Dunaway has since voluntarily removed his flag. 'If people are that offended by it, it is censorship,' he told News 12. 'But I might not have to fly it for a while. Maybe one day I'll be able to fly it again.' Kashmiri demonstrators hold up a flag of the Islamic State during a demonstration against Israeli military operations in Gaza. Although the group adopted the flag, it has long been a symbol of Islam and is was not historically associated with terrorist groups .","Mark Dunaway says that he has been flying this flag for 10 years .

He quickly noticed the car wasn't locked and decided to take it for a spin, not knowing it was baited to catch car thieves. Then he turned on the radio.

"By . Stephanie Linning . Charged: Rebecca Bradbury, who had almost £1,000 taken from her account by Orange for a bill she racked up checking her emails abroad . A holidaymaker was left penniless when Orange took almost £1,000 from her bank account in data roaming charges. Rebecca Bradbury, 25, says she asked the operator about possible high fees before her two-week trip to Thailand. She says she was reassured that she would receive warning texts if she spent too much. She also bought a ‘bolt-on’ package of an extra 10MB of data for £12.77. She said: ‘The person on the phone said there is a scheme that automatically stops customers using more than £50 worth of data when they are roaming, which is opt-out only. ‘Of course, I didn’t opt out of it. I’d heard about all these horror stories, and I wanted to be careful. I never thought it would happen to me.’ Miss Bradbury says she used her iPhone 4 a couple of times to check her emails and Facebook during her trip in May. But when she checked her bank balance, she found Orange had charged her £786.67 for the month and had taken it directly out of her account. The conference company worker, whose bill is usually around £55, insisted: ‘I 100 per cent did not receive any texts from Orange saying that I was over the extra I paid for, let alone the £50 limit. ‘When I noticed all that money was gone from my bank, I first thought I had been robbed. I treated myself to the holiday because I had just finished at one job, and was waiting to start another. ‘The money that Orange took was meant to pay for my rent and food for June before I started my new job.

She said: ‘For most of the last two . days, I was flying home. I don’t know if an app was leaking data, but I . definitely wasn’t using my phone very much. ‘They shouldn’t be able to take so much money from people’s accounts without warning them.’ Orange yesterday said buying ‘bundles’ of data to use abroad invalidates the £50 data limit.

"By . Paul Donnelley . Horrified motorists were forced to swerve as kittens were thrown onto a busy dual carriageway from a speeding car. Drivers were left in shock after witnessing four kittens being thrown from the car window of a mystery vehicle onto the A13 and A132 in Pitsea, Essex. Sadly three kittens died in the sickening incident, although one survived after being rescued by a concerned motorist. Survivor: This beautiful kitten survived being thrown for a speeding car onto the A13 and A132 in Pitsea, Essex . Matthew Tyler, 31, said his wife and four-year-old son were left 'hysterical' after they witnessed the callous act whilst driving at around 5pm on Saturday. He said: 'What I witnessed was absolutely disgusting. 'My wife and son were hysterical. 'I drove on to the main A13 roundabout where I had to swerve quickly to avoid a kitten. 'I then proceeded on to the A132 where kittens were being chucked from a car every 100yds or so. 'Sadly three were killed.' This kitten was treated at Pitsea PDSA and has made a full recovery after being thrown out of a car in Essex . Quick-thinking Mr Tyler, from Bowers Gifford, Essex, returned to the roundabout to retrieve one injured kitten before rushing it to animal charity, PDSA, whose vets administered pain relief. The kitten is now said to be recovering well at the charity's Basildon hospital. Unfortunately - due to the shocking nature of the incident - Mr Tyler was unable to get the number plate of the vehicle and is now appealing to other witnesses to come forward . He added: 'Because I was busy swerving around kittens and my wife was hysterical, we didn't manage to get the details of the car the kittens were being thrown from. 'It was a couple of cars in front of us. 'But I am pleading with anyone who saw this sick act, or knows anything, to contact the police. 'The people who did this need to be found.' In another shocking incident just hours earlier, ten kittens and their mother were found in a taped-up cardboard box. The A13 Coklchester Road in Essex where the kittens were hurled every hundred or so yards . The box had been abandoned at the side of the A127 in Crays Hill, Essex - around five miles from where kittens were seen being thrown from a car later that day. It is not yet known if the two incidents are linked. The abandoned kittens are now available for adoption through Cats Protection on 07986 330239. Anyone who witnessed the kittens being launched from a car at around 5pm on Saturday should call Essex Police on 101. Animal charity PDSA is now caring for the surviving kitten and hope to re-home him after the miracle escape. Maciej Niedbala, a vet at the Basildon PDSA pet hospital, said: ""The kitten was rushed in as an emergency case after being brought in by a member of the public who had witnessed this horrific incident. ""A full examination was carried out to determine the extent of any injuries and pain relief was administered. Miraculously, despite being in shock and deeply traumatised by his ordeal, the kitten did not sustain any serious injuries. ""There is absolutely no justification for anyone to treat an animal in this way and PDSA would urge anyone who witnessed anything to contact police as a matter of urgency."" The kitten was kept overnight so that PDSA staff could monitor his condition and he has since gone on to make a full recovery. Arrangements are now being discussed to find a new permanent home for the kitten who has been named Kenny by staff. Police are hunting for the people responsible for the cruel act. Anyone with information should contact Essex Police on 101.","Incident happened on the A13 and A132 in Pitsea, Essex on Saturday .

"By . Associated Press Reporter . Thousands have gathered in North Korea to commemorate the 61st anniversary of the signing of the armistice that ended the Korean War and split the country in two. While the two Koreas technically remain at war, the North celebrates the armistice as Victory in the Fatherland Liberation War, a major national holiday. High-scale parade that have been seen in previous years did not take place at Sunday's event, with a presentation and some entertainment instead . The Korean War began on June 25, 1950, when the communist government north of the Korean Peninsula's 38th parallel invaded South Korea. It ended on July 27, 1953, upon the signing of an armistice agreement that left the demilitarized zone separating the two countries. Salute: The 61st anniversary of the ""victory of the Korean people in the Fatherland Liberation War' is celebrated in Pyongyang, North Korea .

North Korean leader Kim Jong-un inspects a rocket firing drill directed at US military bases in South Korea, a day before the 61st anniversary of the signing of an Armistice Agreement that ended the 1950-53 Korean War . The day before the anniversary, North Korea fired a short-range ballistic missile into waters off its east coast. The missile, fired from North Korea's southwest Hwanghae province on Saturday evening, flew about 310 miles across the country before landing in the sea, South Korean officials said. North Korea routinely test-fires missiles, artillery and rockets, but the number of weapons tests it has conducted this year is much higher than previous years. Photos have since emerged of North Korea leader Kim Jong-un studying a firing drill directed at US military bases in South Korea. Jong-un did not make an appearance at the anniversary, instead paying his respects just after midnight at the mausoleum where his father and grandfather lie in state. Veterans, now in their 70s and 80s, many wearing uniforms laden with medals and clutching bouquets of flowers, were celebrated in patriotic events around the country. In Pyongyang's central plaza, Kim Il Sung Square, the aged veterans, some crying, told war stories. A mass chorus of schoolchildren sang odes to Kim Jong Un and a crowd of college students was exhorted to be ""the new generation"" in building North Korea under Kim's leadership. To lighten the mood, they were also treated to a show of square dancing and taekwondo. After watching the official events, many people in Pyongyang took the advantage of a sunny day off to enjoy family outings along the capital's riverside promenades.

"By . Associated Press Reporter . A mother who starved her four young . sons and kept them in a filthy Denver apartment covered in feces could . spend up to seven years in prison after pleading guilty Friday to her . second offense of child abuse. Prosecutors . said the case involving Lorinda Bailey, 36, was among the most horrific . they had ever seen, but the state's child abuse laws kept them from . pursuing harsher penalties because the children, ages 2 to 6, did not . suffer serious physical injuries. Six other charges were dropped in exchange for Bailey's guilty plea to a single felony count. Nightmare mom: Lorinda Bailey, 36, seen here in 2013, pleaded guilty to a second offense of child abuse on Friday in exchange, six other counts are being dropped . 'The way the child abuse statue reads, . this was a disposition we thought would hold her accountable as best we . could under the law,' said Lynn Kimbrough, a spokeswoman for the Denver . District Attorney's Office. Police say Bailey and the boy's father, Wayne Sperling, 66, kept their sons in an home filled with cat excrement and buzzing with flies. The . children were not potty-trained and could communicate only in grunts . when authorities removed them from the home in October. They were . alerted by an emergency room doctor, who noticed that the youngest boy . was unwashed, reeked of cigarette smoke and had bruises consistent with . pinching. Doctors couldn’t find any medical records at all for the five-year-old. Wayne Sperling, left, and Lorinda Bailey, right, are accused of neglecting their four young boys and keeping them in a filthy Denver apartment full of cat feces and flies . 'Sick': In 2006, Bailey's children were found covered in dirt and hungry after neighbors saw them playing in the road. She and Sperling were put on probation and ordered to take parenting classes . Monstrous: Officials said that Bailey and Sperling's treatment of their children was the worst case of abuse they have every seen . Sperling . told investigators he was the primary guardian for the boys. Bailey . said she was living in another apartment in the same building but . saw the boys most days. The elderly father has . pleaded not guilty and faces a hearing in October. Bailey remains . free on bond pending her sentencing. Neighbors . said they previously called social services with concerns about the . family, but the agency would not publicly discuss the case for . confidentiality reasons. The couple lost custody of other children amid similar allegations. Officers . found rotten food, trash and insects in the apartment in October 2006, . after passers-by reported two young children playing in the street. The . children mostly grunted and pointed to communicate. Bailey and Sperling pleaded guilty in June 2007 to misdemeanor child abuse and lost custody of their three oldest children. The latest case warranted felony charges because it was a repeat child abuse offense, Kimbrough said. The four boys are now improving in foster care and living together, she said. Charged: Sperling and Bailey were arrested last October and charged with child abuse after their sons were found in filthy conditions . Scene: A man walks past the residence of Sperling, where the four boys were found in deplorable conditions.

The driver of a double-decker tour bus arrested over a crash that injured 15 people in Times Square on Tuesday was under the influence of drugs at the time and has an extensive driving record, it has been revealed. The NYPD have charged William Dalambert, 58, of Irvington, New Jersey, with driving while ability impaired, with tests underway to determine whether he was under the influence of illegal or prescription drugs at the time of the crash. According to The New York Daily News, Dalambert - who was behind the wheel of a Gray Line tour bus that collided with a stationary bus in New York's Midtown district at about 3pm Tuesday - has 11 prior license suspensions. He failed a sobriety test at the scene and submitted blood and urine to police for testing. Scroll down for video .

The accident occurred around 47th Street and Seventh Avenue in Manhattan, an area of Times Square usually teeming with tourists near the TKTS discount Broadway tickets booth and the Hershey's Chocolate World store . Police believe Dalambert first side-swiped a SUV before striking a parked double-decker bus - which was empty save for the driver - before mounting the curb of Seventh Ave. DMV records obtained by The Daily News show Dalambert's traffic convictions date back to June 1993, when his license was first suspended. His most recent offense was in December 2013, when he was caught driving in New Jersey without a license, registration or insurance. The information has raised serious questions about the vetting processes of tour bus drivers. The New York Post reported that both Gray Line and City Sights tour buses are inspected twice a year by the state Department of Transportation. Both passed their inspections in April, according to the paper. However there are now calls for the buses to be regulated on a city level. So great was the noise of the red bus Dalambert was driving colliding with the second bus, people in the area believed a bomb had gone off. The glass windows at the front of Dalambert's bus were shattered in the crash, sending shards flying into passers-by. A yellow traffic light also toppled, its metal pole smashing down onto the sidewalk. 'I heard an explosion and I ran in the opposite direction - I thought it was a bomb,' one female British tourist told Good Morning America. Of the 15 people injured - 14 of them pedestrians - none were considered life-threatening, the Fire Department of New York said. Dalambert was the only person in his bus at the time of the incident. He did not appear to have any injuries. Grateful: People embrace following an accident between two double-decker buses at Duffy Square in Times Square on August 5, 2014 in New York City .

"By . Associated Press Reporter . A patient being kept in isolation at a New York hospital over concerns that he may have contracted Ebola while traveling in West Africa has tested negative for the virus. Health officials said that the man, who has not been identified, had been admitted to Mount Sinai Hospital on Monday, with a high fever and gastrointestinal symptoms. The patient, who had recently returned from a country where the virus has been reported, was said to be improving, but a hospital spokesman has not said what illness he contracted. Scroll down for video . All clear: A patient being treated in an isolation ward at Mount Sinai in New York City does not have Ebola, hospital officials have said . 'The patient is in stable condition, is improving, and remains in the care of our physicians,' the spokesman said. On Wednesday, the hospital confirmed that tests carried out on the patient showed that the illness was not Ebola. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said six people in the U.S., including the New York patient, have been tested for Ebola since the West African outbreak erupted this year, and all results were negative. Officials at U.S. airports are watching travelers from Africa for flu-like symptoms that could be tied to the recent Ebola outbreak there. The Ebola virus causes a hemorrhagic fever that has killed more than 900 people, mostly in Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone. It is spread through direct contact with bodily fluids. Border patrol agents at airports in New York and Washington have been told to ask travelers about possible exposure to the virus, and to be on the lookout for anyone with a fever, diarrhea, red eyes or other symptoms. Health officials have said that the threat to Americans at home remains relatively small.","Patient was kept in an isolation ward while doctors carried out tests .

"By . Associated Press Reporter . The parents of a missing 6-year-old Washington have submitted to lie detector tests to help investigators and searchers looking for little Jenise Wright. However, the results likely will not be released to the public, said Kitsap County sheriff's Deputy Scott Wilson. The tests were taken Monday night as the search continued in the east Bremerton neighborhood around the Steele Creek Mobile Home Park. Officials meeting Tuesday morning were planning their next step, Wilson said. Where is Jenise? Kitsap County sheriff's deputies are searching for Jenise Wright, 6, who is missing and was last seen Saturday night at her home in east Bremerton, Washington . Jenise was last seen Saturday night when she went to bed. Her family noticed her missing Sunday morning but didn't become worried and call for help until that night when she failed to show up for dinner - only 24 hours later - because she had left the home on previous occasions and wandered around the neighborhood. 'My head’s just swimming, I don’t know what to think,' Jenise’s . father, Jim Wright, told Q13 Fox. 'She went to bed, she was asleep. Wake up, [and I think] she’s probably out running and playing.'T . The family felt it was relatively safe because the mobile home park is fenced, Wilson said. The search began early Monday and grew to involve about 100 searchers from ten agencies including three dog teams in the neighborhood and surrounding wooded area. Their job Tuesday is checking all 103 homes in the Steele Creek Mobile Home Park. Local police are also interviewing registered sex offenders in the area, the Bremerton Patriot reported. Meanwhile, state child welfare workers removed two other children, an 8-year-old boy and 12-year-old girl, from the home of the Wright family. The little girl's disappearance was being called a missing person case with 'suspicious circumstances,' Wilson said. Most missing children would have surfaced by now, he said. The investigation now includes the FBI, Washington State Patrol and detectives from nearby police agencies. Out in full force: About 100 officers from ten agencies including three dog teams are scouring the east Bremerton neighborhood for the missing child . On her own: Jenise's parents told police they allowed the 6-year-old to play outside unsupervised because their neighborhood is fenced in and relatively safe . They are 'looking at the entire spectrum of possibilities: Has the child sustained an accident? Has the child been abducted? Has the child come to harm?' Wilson said. The FBI has resources 'that we can only dream about — investigative tools, personnel that specialize in child abduction,' Wilson said. 'We're not calling it an abduction, but why not get those resources early on, examine all the possibilities.' The two parents live in the home in a blended family. The 8-year-old and 12-year-old were the only other children in the home last weekend. A 16-year-old boy was out of town. Two others at the home are adults. Other residents in the park described Jenise as outgoing and unafraid to talk to anyone. 'She's really independent, she's tenacious,' the little girl's father, James Wright, told KOMO-TV, describing the neighborhood as safe and saying his daughter roamed the park. Jenise is described as 3 feet tall, weighs 45lbs and has black hair. She'll be a first-grader this school year. She shared a bedroom with her sister.","Jenise Wright, 6, was last seen in her Bremerton, Washington, home Saturday .

A two-pound Michigan newborn dubbed Mighty Girl by her parents is one of the smallest babies in the world to undergo a heart procedure to open up a blocked artery caused by a congenital defect. A week later, Alexandra Mae Van Kirk is showing signs that her heart is working as it should, and she's growing. 'She's doing fantastic,' her father, Matt Van Kirk, told The Grand Rapids Press for a story published Friday.

'It was very tricky,' said Vettukattil, who added he has heard of only one or two other babies smaller than Alexandra who have undergone the procedure. When Heidi Van Kirk was 22 weeks pregnant, an ultrasound showed Alexandra was small for her stage of gestation, according to M Live. In follow-up checks with health specialists, Alexandra slipped further down the growth track. 'They gave her (a) 35 percent chance of making it to a live birth,' Heidi Van Kirk said. Alexandra was born July 7, entering the world with a full head of hair and with a powerful cry. 'I think everyone in the operating room was pretty much overjoyed,' Matt Van Kirk said. Father Matt introduced Alexandra to her older sister at DeVos Children's Hospital in Grand Rapids . 'We were not expecting a vocal birth.' Alexandra weighed 2 pounds, 3 ounces. The neonatal team diagnosed her with critical pulmonary stenosis. If Alexandra is like most babies who undergo the procedure, she will not need any further treatment, Vettukattil said. 'She's cured.

"By . Associated Press Reporter . A Kansas foster father was high on marijuana when he left a 10-month-old girl in a hot car, where she died, prosecutors said Friday. Details of the case surfaced during a bond hearing for Seth M. Jackson, 29, of Wichita, who is charged with first-degree murder in the baby's July 24 death. KWCH reported that Sedgwick County District Attorney Marc Bennett cited the marijuana use in court as the reason for raising his bond to $250,000. Bennett told the court Jackson had gone to his drug dealer's house and bought marijuana. He said prosecutors believe Jackson came home to consume marijuana, leaving the girl behind in the car. Scroll down for video . Charged: Seth Jackson - pictured right with his . partner Payton Schroeder (left) - has been charged with murder after forgetting . about their 10-month-old foster child and leaving her in a hot car to . die. Jackson was coming home to consume marijuana, the prosecution said Friday . Jackson was initially jailed on a $100,000 bond, and the defense had been trying to get the bond lowered. Police have said Jackson had apparently forgotten about her until something on TV jogged his memory. The girl was left in a the sweltering car with the windows up for more than two hours outside her foster parents' home in Wichita. Temperatures at the time were around 90 degrees. Jackson's defense attorney, John Stang, said earlier this week that prosecutors have gone too far in charging his client with murder and that an involuntary manslaughter charge would have better fit the case. But Bennett has said the charge was warranted because the child died during the commission of an inherently dangerous felony — aggravated endangering of a child. No one alleges the child was intentionally left in the car. Both sides agree the circumstances are entirely different than a widely publicized case in Georgia, where a father is charged with murder and child cruelty charges on suspicion of intentionally leaving a 22-month-old boy in a hot car last month as he went to work. Jackson, 29, was arrested after he found the baby - known as Anna to the new family and Kadillak to her biological relatives - inside his silver Dodge Charger and called emergency services. Baby Kadillak was being cared for by Jackson and his partner Payton Schroeder, 26, who are parents to two adopted boys, aged five and seven. They had cared for the girl for most of her life. Devastated: Jackson's mother is pictured with little Kadillak - known to the foster family as Anna . Loving: The couple have two adopted sons and three foster children. They had been trying to adopt Anna . Jackson had collected her from daycare last Thursday but left her in the car with the windows rolled up as he went inside his home with his five-year-old son - as temperatures reached 95 degrees. When he . ran outside to get the girl, he found her unresponsive. Emergency . dispatchers got a call at 6.41pm, and the girl was pronounced dead a few . minutes later. Seth Jackson's mother . One of . the foster parents was 'hysterically crying' outside the house before they were both taken in by police for questioning, witnesses said. Jackson and his partner had been trying to adopt the 10-month-old girl they had cared for nearly all her life. They also had three other foster children, ages three, five and 18; and had two adopted children, ages five and seven. The two younger foster children were visiting other relatives at the time. Police have said both foster parents were distraught over what happened. Tragic: The girl had been inside this Dodge Charger for more than two hours before she was found . Shocked: Neighbors hug in disbelief near the parked car where a 10-month-old Wichita girl died . Jackson's mother Dottie told NBC that she spoke to her son at 2am Friday. 'He wants to die,' she said. 'Seth's children - that's his life.' The little girl's biological grandmother Cindy Poe, drove to Wichita to try and discover how the tragedy had occurred. 'Accidents . do happen. We don't know if it was accident,' she told NBC station KSN. 'They have a lot of kids they take care of. I want answers.' The couple's adoptive children were taken into protective custody. A neighbor said the men were devoted parents. 'They . are two of the most kind-hearted guys that I have ever met. And I hate . that there's so much controversy right now with babies being left in the . car, because I truly don't feel from the bottom of my heart they would . ever do this on purpose,' Lindey TenEyck, who lives across the street, . told NBC. Devastated: Jackson's mother Dottie said that her son 'wants to die' after the unimaginable tragedy . Distraught: The girl's biological grandmother, Cindy Poe, said she wants to hold her one last time . Both the prosecution and the defense agree the circumstances are entirely different than a widely publicized case in Georgia, where a father is charged with murder and child cruelty charges on suspicion of intentionally leaving the 22-month-old boy in a hot car last month as he went to work. Bennett said this Kansas case is not charged as an intentional murder. 'No one is alleging, it is not charged that he did this intentionally,' Bennett said of the Kansas case. 'We are not intimating, as authorities in Georgia have, there was some plot or anything like that. It is a different charging theory and a different charging authority in Kansas than what appears to be in Georgia.' Jackson' partner, Schroeder, has not been charged. He was already home . when Jackson came in and assumed he'd brought the baby in, according to police reports.

"By . Associated Press Reporter . and MailOnline Reporter . Four teenage boys just weeks from starting ninth grade together have died after a pickup truck collided with their tractor, police said. Sean Kenneally, Mitchell Kluesner, Nicholas Kramer and Bryce Wilwert - all aged 14 - died when the pickup missed a stop sign and plowed into their John Deere utility near an Epworth, Iowa intersection about 1.30pm Saturday. The boys, preparing to begin their freshman year at Western Dubuque High School, had spent the morning filling water balloons before the Epworth Town & Country Days parade. Scroll down for video . Tragic: Mitchell Kluesner (left) and Bryce Wilwert (right), both aged 14, died on Saturday after being hit by a pickup truck in Iowa . Heartbreaking: Sean Kenneally (left) and Nicholas Kramer (right), both aged 14,  were about to start the ninth grade together . The pickup driver, 24-year-old Joe Connolly who was hauling a livestock trailer, was not injured. His two passengers, 25-year-old Joe Lucas of Epworth and 21-year-old Elissa Ericson of Cedar Rapids, were taken to the hospital with minor injuries, according to The Gazette. Lucas was later transferred to the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics in Iowa City but was listed in stable condition. The Dubuque County Sheriff’s Department said it was investigating and working with prosecutors on what charges may be filed. Lives cut short: The four 14-year-olds who were killed Saturday were just weeks away from starting ninth grade together . 'We’re . going to try to meet with the families today to figure out what the kids . were doing,' Dale Snyder, Dubuque County Sheriff’s Office captain and . Epworth Fire Department firefighter, told KCRG. 'There are a lot of questions we have to get answers on today that we didn’t want to press the families on.' He . said the investigation was further complicated because one of the . victims, Mitchell Kluesner, was the son of Epworth Fire Department . lieutenant Todd Kluesner. The boy hoped to follow in his father's . footsteps one day. Tribute: Community members gathered for a prayer service on Monday at St. John the Baptist Catholic Church in Peosta, Iowa, for four boys who died Saturday in a crash south of Epworth, Iowa . Drexler Middle School Principal Mary Jane Maher said the communities of Epworth, Peosta and Dyersville were in disbelief at the loss of the boys, who wrestled and played basketball at school. 'They were four fantastic young gentlemen. All of them highly involved in school, not only athletics but involved in school in as many ways as could be,' Maher said. 'They were the kind of kids that you love to have in class, always bringing something to the classroom to make people smile. Just four really good kids from four amazing families.' Residents of the small Iowa town are  grasping to make sense of the tragic loss of four young lives. The teens had spent the morning tossing water balloons along the parade route, with people along the parade route tossing them back - a town tradition for kids on the wrestling float. 'They were having fun as a team - and then this,' said Paul Cleary, the wrestling coach at Western Dubuque High School in Epworth, told THONLINE.com. Scene: Skid marks remain at the intersection of Hartbecke Road and East Pleasant Grove Road near Epworth, Iowa where four boys were killed on Saturday . Heartbreaking: A memorial had been erected near the intersection of Hartbecke and East Pleasant Grove roads near Epworth, Iowa where four boys were killed . The four boys were riding on a John Deere Gator, a four-wheeled utility vehicle often used on farms with two seats in front and a flatbed behind the seats for hauling. It's not immediately clear where the boys were headed, but they may have been going to Wilwert's farm, Cleary said. The utility vehicle isn't licensed for road use in Iowa but can legally be operated on public roads if the use involves farm work. It also can be operated by someone as young as 14 for farming purposes, Dubuque County Sheriff Capt. Dale Snyder said. The Western Dubuque Community School District, Iowa's largest by geographic area encompassing 555 square miles, is planning to make counselors available for families, Maher said. The Rev. Michael Schueller, of St. Elizabeth Pastorate in Epworth, said Sunday services were somber but typical of what happens in small, closely knit farming communities when people need support and help. 'These are small towns. The people are pretty resilient. They come together with families and friends in particular and especially in their faith,' he said. Community members gathered for a prayer service on Monday at St. John the Baptist Catholic Church in Peosta, Iowa, to pay tribute to the boys. A local restaurant has donated food for the funeral dinners for the families and caskets for the boys have been donated by Trappist Caskets, a business operated by Roman Catholic monks since 1849 at the New Melleray Abbey near Peosta.

"By . Associated Press Reporter . and Zoe Szathmary . Democratic Vice President Joe Biden appeared to cross party lines at the National Urban League conference on Thursday when he said he wished he had a Republican child. Speaking at the Cincinnati conference, Biden said 'I should have had one Republican kid grow up and make money,' to laughter from the audience. 'But um - so if they put me in a home I get a window with a view, you know what I mean?' he joked. Scroll down for video . Having regrets? Speaking at the Cincinnati conference, Biden said 'I should have had one Republican kid grow up and make money' 'But my daughter is a social worker. Graduate school at Penn and runs an at-risk program, an at-risk youth program for kids getting out of prison and young men getting out of prison,' Biden said. The vice president was referring to his daughter Ashley Biden. Her 2012 wedding announcement said she worked at the Delaware Department of Services for Children, Youth and Their Families. Biden's son Beau serves as Delaware's Attorney General, and son Hunter is a practicing attorney who is also on the board of directors for a Ukrainian gas company . Speaking at the conference, whose theme is 'One Nation Underemployed,' Biden said the keys to putting more people in better-paying jobs and spurring economic growth in cities are workforce training to meet today's business needs and improving roads, bridges and other transportation. 'This is a new era,' Biden said. 'We are better-positioned than anybody in the world, but we need to invest in infrastructure and skilled job training.' President Barack Obama's $302 billion plan earlier this year to increase transportation spending and keep transit programs going for four years got a chilly reception from Republicans in Congress. House Speaker John Boehner, the Republican from a northern Cincinnati suburb, said in a statement Thursday that Biden should urge Democrats to work with House Republicans to help the economy by expanding energy production and cutting government red tape. Sprinkling his speech with quotes from civil rights leaders such as the late Whitney Young and Martin Luther King Jr., Biden said minority gains both economically and in civil rights are 'under siege.' Biden's daughter Ashley is a social worker, son Beau is Delaware's Attorney General, and son Hunter is a practicing attorney who is also on the board of directors for a Ukrainian gas company . He blasted voter ID and other proposals he said would restrict voting in the guise of preventing fraud and corruption that doesn't happen. He made similar comments Wednesday to another major civil rights organization, the NAACP convention in Las Vegas. 'Name it for what it is - an attempt to repress minority voting,' Biden said Thursday. He said that protecting voting 'used to be a bipartisan thing.' Earlier, Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus assured attendees that the GOP is making a serious, determined effort to build ties with minority voters while saying blacks continue to lag in unemployment and other economic measures during the Obama administration. Blacks overwhelmingly supported Obama in his two presidential elections. Republicans have added 'black engagement' staffers in various states, including swing-state Ohio, to help reach out to black voters, Priebus said. 'So we want you to know, desperately, that the Republican Party is listening, we want a relationship, we want to fight for everybody in this country,' he said. 'We're serious about doing things differently.' Urban League president Marc Morial said the nonpartisan organization likes a diverse discussion and wants to keep up a dialogue with Republicans. Biden hasn't ruled out running for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2016. Some 8,500 people are in Cincinnati for the conference, which besides discussions about urban issues and civil rights will honor actor Forest Whitaker at its Saturday night dinner and features an advance screening of 'Get On Up,' the biopic about soul music star James Brown.","Speaking at the National Urban League conference, Biden said 'I should have had one Republican kid grow up and make money'

A friend of Boston Marathon bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev is believed to have provided the handgun used to kill a MIT police officer during the manhunt. Stephen Silva appeared in federal court on charges related to heroin trafficking and possession of a handgun with an obliterated serial number. An attorney for Silva, Jonathan Shapiro, said Tuesday evening that he had received the case only a few hours earlier. 'According to news reports, law-enforcement officials say it is the same weapon that was used ... in the MIT officer Sean Collier shooting. However, this has not been charged in the indictment,' Shapiro said. Victim: This file photo shows Sean Collier, 26, of Somerville, Mass., who was shot to death Thursday, April 18, 2013 on the school campus in Cambridge, Mass. Stephen Silva, a friend of Boston Marathon bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, was arrested and is believed to have provided the handgun used to kill Collier . 'I am in the process of meeting with my client and reviewing the available evidence which will eventually be presented in a court of law in accordance with our system of justice,' Shapiro said in a statement. 'Out of respect for that system and for my client, I cannot make any further comment on the case.' The 9 mm Ruger pistol described in the indictment is the same handgun that was used to kill MIT police officer Sean Collier during the manhunt for the bombing suspects, according to the two people, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the investigation. The grand jury indictment, which was filed July 15, does not mention Collier's slaying or any connection to Tsarnaev. The origin of the gun was among the lingering mysteries of the investigation into the April 2013 attack, in which three people were killed and more than 260 were injured when twin bombs exploded near the finish line. Collier, 26-year-old MIT campus police officer, was ambushed several days later and shot multiple times in his car. According to the indictment, Silva knowingly obtained the gun in February 2013, 'which had the importer's and manufacturer's serial number removed, obliterated, and altered and had previously been shipped and transported in interstate and foreign commerce.' Charged: Dzhokhar Tsarnaev has pleaded not guilty and is scheduled for trial in November. He faces the possibility of the death penalty if convicted . Attack: Three people were killed and more than 260 were injured when twin bombs exploded near the Boston Marathon finish line in April 2013 . The indictment also alleges that Silva conspired to distribute heroin this summer in the Boston area. Silva is a friend of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev. He said in court Tuesday that he graduated from Cambridge Rindge and Latin School in 2011, the same year as Tsarnaev. Silva was ordered to remain in custody ahead of a bail hearing scheduled for Aug. 6. ABC News reports the gun was bought legally in Maine by a different person and was later given to a Portland-based drug gang, whose 'leader' is from the same town as Silva. NECN reported FBI agents were at Silva's apartment on Monday. 'They rolled up packed, there was like 15 of them everywhere, I saw them carrying out cases,' witness Mr. Francois told the station. Francois also said Silva's friendship with Dzhokhar Tsarnaev and Robel Phillipos 'was a brotherhood, really.' 'When things first happened he was like, ""I don’t even smoke weed like that anymore, the FBI are on me, they’re bothering me, harassing me,' so he knew what was going on,"" friend Visa Lorenzo told the station. Dzhokhar's brother, Tamerlan Tsarnaev, was killed in a shootout with police several days after the bombings. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev escaped but was soon found, wounded and hiding in a boat dry-docked in a backyard in suburban Watertown. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev has pleaded not guilty and is scheduled for trial in November. He faces the possibility of the death penalty if convicted. Four other men have been charged with crimes related to the bombing investigation. On Monday, a federal jury found Azamat Tazhayakov guilty of obstruction of justice and conspiracy for trying to protect Tsarnaev by agreeing with another friend, Dias Kadyrbayev, to get rid of a backpack and disable fireworks they took from his dorm room. Kadyrbayev is to be tried next month on the same charges. Robel Phillipos, who is charged with lying to investigators about being in the dorm room with Kadyrbayev and Tazhayakov the night the items were taken, is to have a separate trial in September. And a friend of Tamerlan Tsarnaev, Khairulluzon Matanov, is to be tried next year on charges that he lied to investigators about the extent of his friendship with Tamerlan Tsarnaev and the contact he had with both brothers in the days following the bombings.","Stephen Silva appeared in federal court .

"By . Associated Press Reporter . and Zoe Szathmary . A former teacher was found guilty Monday of six felonies for bashing his wife on the head with a rock and pushing her off a cliff because of a dispute over an affair and a $4million inheritance. Charles Black and his wife Lisa Zahn, both retired teachers from Kansas, had moved to the coastal Maine community of Camden - but argued over an affair Black had with an Arizona woman and how he spent money from the inheritance, which was from her father. Prosecutors said the dispute culminated when Black, 71, hit his wife on the head with a rock before pushing her off 800-foot Maiden Cliff in April 2011. Convicted: This undated booking photo released by the Knox County Sheriffís Office shows Charles Black, who reportedly struck his wife with a rock and tried who kill her . Both Zahn and Black tumbled down the mountainside, and both were hospitalized for more than a week. Zahn said she believed he was pursuing her down the mountain, while Black told investigators that he had no memory of hitting her or pushing her off the cliff. Black told police that he'd collected two rocks while they were on the mountaintop with the thinking that they'd toss them over the cliff, symbolizing getting rid of baggage and hoping for a fresh start. The couple divorced in 2013 after nine years of marriage. Zahn, 55, embraced prosecutor Geoff Rushlau on Monday after the jury convicted Black. Rushlau said Black's punishment, which is pending, 'could represent a life sentence' for the defendant, who now lives in Salt Lake City. 'It's an absolute miracle that she's alive,' Rushlau said, adding that Black 'was trying to kill his wife — he failed in that effort.' Victim: Lisa Zahn has said that she believes Charles was chasing her when he, too, fell down the mountain . Black showed little emotion as the jury read its verdict. His attorney, Walter McKee, said he believed he had established a reasonable doubt, in part because there was none of Zahn's blood on Black's pants after the fall. But Rushlau argued in his closing statement that Zahn's blood was found on Black's shoes and jacket. During the trial, Zahn testified that Black had an affair and spent inheritance money without seeking her permission. She said she recalled being hit three times on the head before being pulled to the cliff's edge. She landed on a ledge and made her way to the bottom to get help. The Camden Herald reported the Black's mistress - and former high school girlfriend - Candice Carter earlier testified that their affair started after she reached out to him on Facebook. After Zahn suffered a perforated bladder in January 2011, Carter testified Black told her his wife's death 'will be the easy way out,' the newspaper reported. In court, Rushau said that Black's nighstand held a book with Carter's signature, according to Bangor Daily News. An estate lawyer also testified in court that Black 'was much more active in the [estate planning] meetings than Lisa,' the Daily News reported. Black did not testify during the trial. During the trial, Black was barred from staying in Camden, where his former wife continues to live, because he was deemed to be a threat. He was held without bail pending sentencing, which has not been set.","Charles Black, 71, was found guilty Monday of six felonies .

"By . Associated Press Reporter . Prosecutors say they won't use any photos of a 17-year-old's genitals in their effort to prove a sexting case against the teen. The teen had previously been subject to a search warrant demanding photos of his erect penis. The Washington Post reports that prosecutors moved ahead with plans to prosecute the teen during a closed hearing Tuesday in juvenile court. The teen's attorney, Jessica Harbeson Foster, says prosecutors told the judge that the photos were not necessary. 'It's an outrageous case,' Foster told AFP. Virginia police have said they will not proceed with controversial efforts to take explicit photos of a 17-year-old to prove a sexting case against him (file picture) The teen left the state to evade a search warrant demanding photos of his erect penis. Authorities were trying to prove he sent similar pictures to his then-15-year-old girlfriend. Facing severe criticism, police said last week they would no longer seek those photos. And at Tuesday's hearing, prosecutors said they would not use other photos of his genitals that had already been taken. Prosecutors in Prince William County earlier told a judge they needed photos of the 17-year-old's erect penis. Foster said she is unaware of any cases where police have pursued similar photographs, particularly of a minor. 'This is crazy,' she said. 'Nobody's even heard of something like this. ... The charges are excessive, and the means by which they are seeking evidence are outrageous.' The teen's appointed guardian ad litem, Carlos Flores Laboy, said his understanding is that police planned to do some sort of computer analysis of the photos to try and prove a similarity to the explicit photo found on the girl's phone. He said the search warrant vividly demonstrates the importance of defending individuals' constitutional rights against invasions of privacy. 'Doing this to an adult would be traumatic. We're talking about a 17-year-old child. Doing it to a 17-year-old would be even worse,' he said. A guardian ad litem is an attorney appointed to serve as an advocate in certain juvenile cases. The lawyers said police told them they planned to obtain the photo by taking the teen to a hospital and injecting him with a chemical that would cause an erection . The lawyers said police told them they planned to obtain the photo by taking the teen to a hospital and injecting him with a chemical that would cause an erection. The Associated Press isn't naming the teen or his aunt in accordance with a policy of not identifying juvenile suspects. Police have been pursuing the case since January, the aunt said, when the girlfriend's mom discovered the explicit content. She said prosecutors insisted on getting the photographs after her nephew turned down a plea deal that would have required a year of probation in which he would be forbidden from using a cellphone or the Internet. She was concerned that a slipup on probation — even a single use of a social media account like Facebook or Twitter — would leave him exposed to a felony record and a requirement to register as a sex offender. She said her nephew has received a lot of support since the case was first reported last week on WRC-TV, the NBC affiliate in Washington. Police and prosecutors did not return calls Wednesday afternoon seeking comment. The Manassas City Police later posted a statement on its website saying that it is not their policy 'to authorize invasive search procedures of suspects in cases of this nature and no such procedures have been conducted in this case.' The statement added that police were contacted by the mother of the 15-year-old girl 'who was sent pornographic videos' by the 17-year-old 'after repeatedly being told to stop.'","Prosecutors said in a Tuesday hearing they won't use any photos of a 17-year-old's genitals in their effort to prove a sexting case against him .

"By . Snejana Farberov . and Associated Press Reporter . Aaron Hernandez will go on trial for first-degree murder in early January - but you wouldn't know it from the former football star's jovial demeanor during Tuesday's court hearing. The 24-year-old former New England Patriot-turned-murder suspect smirked and grinned while standing next to his attorney in Bristol Superior Court in Fall River today. Jury selection would get under way January 9, 2015, first step in the legal process that will determine the athlete’s responsibility in the shooting death of Odin L. Lloyd in 2013. Something to smile about? Aaron Hernandez, 24, wore a big smile on his face during a court hearing Tuesday when he learned that one of his murder trials will get under way in January 2015 . Wheels of justice: Jury will be selected from a pool of 1,000 candidates over the course of several days beginning January 9 . Judge Susan Garsh said jurors would be selected from a pool of 1,000 people brought in over several days. Mr Hernandez appeared in high spirits during an earlier hearing last month when another judge informed him that he is to spend a year in jail before going a trial in ay 2015 for an unrelated 2012 drive-by shooting that left two strangers dead. Also on Tuesday, Hernandez's lawyer Michael Fee said that a dispute over records the defense had sought from the New England Patriots has been resolved, though it's unclear whether the documents were turned over. That prompted the cancellation of a separate hearing before a different judge that was scheduled for the afternoon. Defense attorneys declined to comment outside court. The Patriots' attorney, Andrew Phelan, referred questions to team spokesman Stacey James, who said the team had no comment. A step forward: Hernandez's lawyer said that a dispute over records the defense had sought from the New England Patriots has been resolved . Family: Ursula Ward, mother of murder victim Odin Lloyd listens during a hearing for her son's suspected killer . The Patriots had agreed to turn over 317 pages of personnel records sought by the defense, including medical and training records. But the team objected to producing nine pages of scouting reports and a one-and-a-half page summary of a psychological assessment produced by an outside company. Hernandez, 24, has pleaded not guilty to murder in the June 2013 killing of Odin Lloyd, a semi-professional football player from Boston who had been dating the sister of Hernandez's fiancee. Lloyd's bullet-riddled body was found in an industrial area not far from Hernandez's North Attleborough, Massachusetts, home. The team released Hernandez on the day of his arrest. The defense had called Hernandez's full team records necessary to prepare for trial, and said they may contain critical information about the former player's state of mind. More legal trouble: Hernandez is also facing a separate murder trial for a 2012 drive-by shooting . Inked: Hernandez's heavily tattooed hands are cuffed as he leaves the courtroom after a hearing in Bristol County Superior Court Tuesday . Phelan, meanwhile, had accused Hernandez's attorneys of being on a 'fishing expedition.' He said the scouting reports contained trade secrets and were irrelevant to the case. He also said the Patriots had offered the defense the option of reviewing, but not copying, the psychological assessment summary. The team wanted the defense to get the assessment from the company that wrote it, which provides character and mental assessments to professional sports organizations. Hernandez, who is from Bristol, Connecticut, has pleaded not guilty, in a separate case, to the murder of Safiro Furtado and Daniel de Abreu in Boston in 2012. He's being held without bail.","Jury selection for the 24-year-old ex-New England Patriot will get under way January 9, 2015 .

"By . Snejana Farberov . and Associated Press Reporter . A lawyer for the wife of a Georgia man arrested in the death of their toddler who was left in a overheated SUV said Tuesday the mother is devastated by her loss. Criminal defense attorney Lawrence Zimmerman said Leanna Harris is ‘living every parent's nightmare’ after the death of her 22-month-old son, Cooper. The woman's husband, Justin Ross Harris, 33, was arrested on charges of murder and child cruelty after the boy's death June 18. Mom: Police have not named Leanna Harris as a suspect and she has not been charged with any crime . The father told police he left his son in the backseat of his SUV for about seven hours after forgetting to drop him off at day care and going to work, investigators in the Atlanta suburb of Cobb County have said. Leanna Harris has not been charged in the case. Zimmerman criticized media coverage of her reaction to her son's death, saying speculation over a perceived lack of emotion in the case thus far is similar to what 1996 Olympic bombing hero Richard Jewell faced after an attack that year on the summer games in Atlanta. Jewell led people away from a suspicious backpack before a blast killed one and left more than 100 people injured. He became the target of intense scrutiny after an unattributed news report said he was the focus of the investigation into the attack. Jewell's name was cleared in 2006 and he died the following year at age 44. ‘Newspapers, television and online media have fostered a poisonous atmosphere in which Leanna's every word, action and emotion — or failure to cry in front of a crowd — is scrutinized for some supposed hidden meaning,’ Zimmerman said. He added that the media has dug into his client's upbringing, marriage and sex life. Zimmerman also said Leanna Harris has been unable to return to work and she's asking to be allowed to mourn her son out of the public eye. Family: The Atlanta Journal Constitution claims there are discrepancies int he evidence in the case of Justin Ross Harris, pictured right with his wife and late son Cooper . 'She will never be able to tuck him into bed at night and return later to check on him. 'She . mourns Cooper's death deeply, in her own private way,' the lawyer . stated. 'She takes comfort from a strong faith in God, but the loss is . still overwhelming. Getting through each day seems almost impossible.' During . an hourslong probable cause hearing on July 3, prosecutors said . evidence shows Justin Ross Harris had been leading a double life and was . sending nude photos with several women — including at least one . teenager — even on the day his son died. The . couple had two life insurance policies for the toddler, one for $2,000 . and one for $25,000. After his son's death, Harris talked with relatives . about what they needed to do to file claims, investigators have said. Harris' defense attorney Maddox Kilgore has argued that evidence in the case is . insufficient and the boy's death was a tragic accident. Justin Ross Harris remains jailed without bond. Investigation: Cobb County police investigate the SUV where toddler Cooper Harris died near Marietta, Ga., when his father Ross forgot to drop his child off at day care and went to work . Last Thursday, police said a . toxicology tests on the body of 22-month-old Cooper had negative . results, but they didn't say what substances they tested for. Toxicology tests typically are used to detect foreign substances such as drugs in a person's system. A . growing number of questions are being asked about Leanna Harris' unusual behavior in the wake of young Cooper’s horrific death inside a . sweltering SUV last month. Harris, . a 30-year-old dietitian, expressed little emotion throughout her . husband's preliminary hearing last week, despite a number of shocking . allegations including that her husband had been sexting with six . different women, some teenagers, on the day their young son had passed . away. As . prosecutors said her husband was practically leading a double life and . should not be granted bond, Leanna Harris chewed gum and stared blankly . ahead. During last Thursday’s proceedings, investigators described her own behavior on the day her son died as odd, if not suspicious. No bond: Justin Ross Harris, the Georgia man charged with murder after his toddler son died inside of a hot SUV, was refused bond on July 3 and will now remain in jail until he is tried . When informed by workers at her son’s . day care facility that Cooper had never been dropped off, she calmly . responded, ‘Ross must have left him in the car. There’s no other . explanation,’ according to Cobb County Police Det. Phil Stoddard’s . testimony. Then, when . reunited with her husband at police headquarters after he had been . charged with murder, Leanna Harris asked him, ‘Did you say too much?’ according to Stoddard. When she called home June 18 with the . grim news of Cooper’s death, her mother could be overheard on the phone . saying: ‘Why aren’t you crying? Why aren’t you reacting?’ Her response, according to Stoddard: ‘I must be in shock.’ Police . had previously disclosed that, like her husband, she had researched . children dying in hot vehicles prior to her son Cooper’s death, telling . officers it was her ‘worst fear.’ At Cooper’s funeral - and with her husband listening from jail on speaker phone - she said she held no anger toward him. Heartbreaking details: Detective Stoddard testified that there was scratch marks on Cooper Harris' face and abrasions on the back of the toddler's head . Justin Ross Harris is accused of leaving his 22-month-old son Cooper to die in a scorching hot SUV on June 18 . ‘Ross . is and was a wonderful father,’ she told mourners, before telling her . husband of seven years: ‘I love you and I’m doing this for you.’ Some of Leanna Harris’ comments during her eulogy at Cooper’s funeral have also raised suspicions. ‘Some of you might wonder how I’m standing here today and I ask myself the same question,’ the deeply religious mother said. ‘I should be crumpled into a pile of tears and snot on the ground. (The Lord) is standing behind me, holding me up.' Aftermath: Guests leave the funeral for Cooper Harris after hearing an emotional call from father Ross from prison as he said goodbye last month . Leanna Harris listened intently to the evidence against her husband being presented by the prosecution and was later escorted to a waiting car after Justin Harris was denied bond . The . 250 or so mourners who gathered at University Church of Christ gave her . two rounds of applause as she said she wouldn’t bring her son back, . even if she could. ‘He’s in the most peaceful, wonderful place there is.’ Justin Ross Harris was denied bond last Thursday by a judge who called it a 'possible death penalty case.' He remains in jail on murder and child cruelty charges and prosecutors may seek to use Leanna Harris as a witness. In . Georgia, the spousal privilege shielding a wife from testifying against . her husband, doesn’t apply in cases of the death of a child. Harris described Cooper as peaceful with his eyes closed, when this wasn't the case, according to Stoddard. He allegedly also told his wife: 'I dreaded how he would look'","Criminal defense attorney Lawrence Zimmerman said Leanna Harris is devastated after the death of her 22-month-old son, Cooper .

"By . Associated Press Reporter . and Zoe Szathmary . A New Hampshire man who as a teenager became involved with his high school teacher and killed her husband with the help of his three friends was moved to a minimum-security prison and approved for a work-release program. William 'Billy' Flynn and his friends were allegedly recruited by his former lover and self-esteem course teacher Pamela Smart to kill her husband Gregg Smart. The case inspired the Nicole Kidman 1995 movie 'To Die For.' The prison classification board determined the . 'likelihood of rehabilitation will be enhanced by participation in the . Work Release Program,' according to WCVB. He was transferred to a facility in Warren, Maine. Depending on a work-release program's structure, a prisoner may spend several hours outside of a correctional facility as he or she learns job skills. Flynn had testified against Smart and said she wanted her husband dead so she wouldn't lose her condo, furniture and dog in a divorce. Flynn pleaded guilty to second-degree murder in the death of Gregg Smart in May 1990 and was sentenced to 28 years to life in prison. Transferred: William Flynn, seen in this Jan. 25 2008 file photo, was transferred this past week to a facility in Warren, Maine, as part of a work-release program . Pamela Smart, then 22, began a torrid affair with Flynn when he was 15 and a student in a self-esteem course she had volunteered to teach at Winnacunnet High School in Hampton, where she was the media services director. Flynn testified that Smart helped plan her husband's killing to make it look like a burglary. He said she persuaded him and his friends to kill her husband so she and Flynn could be together. She also stood to gain $140,000 from insurance on Gregg Smart's life. Gregg Smart was shot to death at the couple's Derry condo. According to testimony, a friend of Flynn's, Patrick Randall, held a knife to Smart's throat, and Flynn - after asking God for forgiveness - fired a .38-caliber revolver. Two other friends, Raymond Fowler and Vance Lattime Jr., were in a getaway car. Guilty: In this March 12, 1991 file photo, William Flynn, 17,  testifies in the Pamela Smart murder conspiracy trial.  Flynn was moved to a minimum-security prison this past week as part of a work-release program . Lover: In this March 18, 1991 file photo, Pamela Smart, 23, takes the oath before sitting in the witness stand. At 15 William Flynn began a torrid affair with Smart, his teacher for a self-esteem course at his high school . Smart died a week before he and Pamela could celebrate their wedding anniversary. Pamela Smart was convicted of conspiracy to commit murder, being an accomplice to first-degree murder and witness tampering. She was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole and has maintained she had nothing to do with plotting her husband's murder. Smart is incarcerated at Bedford Hills Correctional Facility in New York state. Smart told WCVB in 2010 'I never wanted Gregg killed. I never wanted him to kill Gregg. I never asked him to. I never insinuated that I wanted him to kill my husband.' 'I'm so much more than the worst mistake of my life,' she also told the affiliate station at the time. 'And I feel like I've been frozen in time inside that mistake to get involved with Bill, and I have never been able to get out of it.' Smart also alleged in a 2010 interview with Marie Claire that that she had been raped by a guard while serving time and had been beaten by two other inmates in 1996. Smart's spokeswoman Eleanor Pam recently told WCVB, 'Is it justice for the men who are directly responsible for the murder of Greg Smart to be released while Pamela Smart -- who was neither directly or indirectly responsible for his killing -- remains in prison for the rest of her natural life without the possibility of parole?' The other three teens were convicted of murder conspiracy or accomplice charges. The case was tabloid fodder and led to books and movies, including the 1995 film 'To Die For,' which starred Kidman as a weather reporter for an affiliate news station who enlists three teens, played by Joaquin Phoenix, Casey Affleck and Alison Folland, to kill her husband.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . and Associated Press Reporter . A 27-year-old mother convicted in the mysterious disappearance of her infant son, known as 'Baby Gabriel', five years ago has been released from prison. Elizabeth Johnson walked out of Perryville state prison in Arizona early Friday morning. The Arizona woman was given a more than five-year . sentence in 2012 for custodial interference and unlawful imprisonment after Gabriel vanished without a trace in 2009. Scroll down for video . Out of jail: Elizabeth Johnson, 27 (pictured) was  was released from Perryville state prison in Arizona early Friday morning . Johnson's attorney, Marc Victor, said his client, who had begged the judge for a longer prison sentence, was ready for a new start. 'I think she has matured a lot from this entire experience,' Victor told ABC15. 'She has what I would call some grand plans to move on with her life.' Victor added that Johnson didn't know where Gabriel was, but assumed he was with a good family. She said it probably wouldn't be in his best interests if they were reunited. 'Justice was served here. Elizabeth was convicted of exactly the crimes she committed. She's served her sentence and now faces four years' probation,' Victor told azcentral.com. 'What's least understood about Elizabeth is that at all times she acted in what she believed was Gabriel's best interests. There was a ton of information we didn't bring out that showed she loved Gabriel at all times.' Vanished: Elizabeth Johnson was convicted in the disappearance of her eight-month-old son Gabriel (both pictured) in 2012. Gabriel went missing in 2009 . Tragic: Gabriel, aged eight months (pictured left and right) disappeared in 2009 and still has not been found . The tragic story of Gabriel's disappearance captured national attention, with many Americans still regarding Johnson as a 'suspected baby-killer'. According to court testimony, in December 2009, Johnson had an argument with Gabriel's father, Logan McQueary, and fled with the child. Johnson had been fighting with McQueary about whether to give up Gabriel for adoption. She signed over temporary guardianship of the boy to a Scottsdale couple for about 10 days before she picked him up and left Arizona. Two days after leaving McQueary, she sent him a text saying she suffocated the boy and dumped his body in the trash outside a San Antonio, Texas hotel room. 'I killed him. You made me do it,' Johnson wrote to McQueary two days after Christmas. She fled to Florida where she was arrested on December 30. However, following her capture, she changed her story, claiming she gave Gabriel to a couple in a park in San Antonio. Johnson never identified the pair. Investigators searched dumpsters, landfills and parks, but never found the boy. Convicted: Elizabeth Johnson (pictured) was given a more than five-year sentence in 2012 for custodial interference and unlawful imprisonment in the 2009 disappearance of her son Gabriel . Elizabeth Johnson (pictured) had begged the judge for more prison time in 2012 when she was sentenced to five years jail in the disappearance of her son . During the trial, McQueary's family pleaded with Johnson to tell them where Gabriel was. 'This isn't over for our family,' Frank McQueary, Gabriel's paternal grandfather, said. 'This is not going to be over until we know where Gabriel is.' In October 2012, Johnson was charged with custodial interference and unlawful imprisonment. The jury failed to reach a verdict on a kidnapping charge — the most serious count against her which would have attracted a more than 20 year sentence. In December, Maricopa County Superior Court Judge Joseph Kreamer sentenced Johnson to five years and three months jail, and four years of probation on release. She received credit toward her prison sentence for the nearly three years that she served in jail after her arrest. Kreamer could have sentenced her to 9 1/2 years but said he took into account her troubled childhood and mental instability, agreeing with a psychologist who testified she needed treatment.

"By . Associated Press Reporter . A Utah mother accused of killing six newborn babies was addicted to meth and didn't want the responsibility of being a parent, police said. Megan Huntsman is facing six first-degree murder charges after her estranged husband Darren West found a tiny body in a sealed container. DNA results confirmed on Tuesday that West was the father of the six babies believed to have been strangled or suffocated, as well as a seventh believed to be a stillborn. Scroll down for video . Claims: Megan Huntsman, who is facing six murder charges, was allegedly addicted to meth and didn't want to care for her babies, police say . Tests: DNA results show Huntsman's estranged husband Darren West fathered the babies. He is not a suspect . Huntsman, 39, allegedly said she had not been concerned about her babies' health, and didn't want to care for them, authorities told AP. Pleasant Grove police captain Mike Roberts said the 39-year-old was addicted to meth at the time the babies died, from 1996 to 2006. Police had previously declined to discuss a motive in the alleged murders. All seven babies were found in a garage at Huntsman's home, and had been carried to full term. DNA results from the FBI also revealed the sex of the babies, confirming that five had been girls and two were boys. Huntsman, who told police she strangled or suffocated six of the babies, is in jail on $6 million bail. She has not entered a plea. Her husband, West, is not a suspect in the case. Crime scene: The bodies of seven newborn babies were found in the garage of Huntsman's home . Investigation: Police search the garage where Huntsman's husband found one of the seven bodies . He had been living with her during the decade the babies were killed, but from 2006 to January he was in federal prison on drug charges. It was West who discovered the first body after opening a small white box covered with electrician's tape on April 12. Documents state that West also told police he . discovered the baby in a plastic bag with a strong chemical odor . emanating from it. West said there was no decomposition smell, just a chemical odor. Police in Pleasant Grove discovered the six other dead babies after obtaining a search warrant for the house. They were in boxes throughout the garage, wrapped in shirts or towels, documents show. Huntsman . told police in a phone conversation on the day the first body was found . by her husband that the baby was stillborn, and she had been  afraid to . go to police or a hospital, the search warrant affidavit says, . She didn't say why she was scared. Grim: Huntsman, pictured in court on April 21, told police she had strangled or suffocated six of the babies . Authorities reported finding bloody leather gloves and women's underwear in the garage, and infant booties and clothes in the master bedroom. Police took stained sections of a mattress in the master bedroom as evidence. During a brief first court appearance in Provo, the shackled Huntsman mostly kept her eyes focused downward as she was informed of the charges. Defense attorney Doug Thompson told reporters afterward that he has spoken with Huntsman and she seemed fine, though he declined to provide details on her state of mind. The FBI had been brought in to help analyze DNA results because no labs in Utah were able to examine the type of DNA taken from the small corpses, police said.","Megan Huntsman, 39, is facing six charges of murder .

"By . Associated Press Reporter . Barack Obama has offered U.S. help in negotiating a cease-fire to end the escalating violence between Israel and Hamas. The offer came as world leaders warned of an urgent need to avoid another Israeli-Palestinian war that could engulf the fragile region. In a phone call with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Obama lent his support to Israel's efforts to defend itself against an onslaught of rocket fire from the Hamas-controlled Gaza Strip, but  called on both sides to protect civilians and restore calm. Defense: Israel's Iron Dome intercepts rockets fired from Gaza on Thursday . The White House said the U.S. was . willing to 'facilitate a cessation of hostilities,' potentially along . the lines of a 2012 cease-fire that the U.S. helped broker. Mounting . casualties and the growing prospect of an Israeli ground incursion in . Gaza drew alarm at the United Nations. Secretary-General Ban . Ki-moon told an emergency Security Council meeting that it is more . urgent than ever to avoid another Israeli-Palestinian war that could . engulf the entire region. He called on both sides to agree to a . cease-fire. 'It is unacceptable for citizens on both sides to permanently live in fear of the next aerial attack,' Ban said. More than 85 people have been killed, including dozens of civilians, since Israel began an offensive on Tuesday against the Hamas militant group in Gaza. Israeli soldiers stand on tanks near the Gaza border on Thursday as the country tries to intercept Palestinian attacks . The offensive aims to put an end to unrelenting rocket fire from Gaza that has reached ever deeper into the Jewish state and intensified amid spiraling tensions over the killing of three Israeli teenagers and the apparent revenge killing of a Palestinian teenager. The offer to help bring about a cease-fire could draw the U.S. deeper into a conflict the U.S. fears could destabilize the region, but precisely what role the U.S. would play remains unclear. The United States considers Hamas to be a terrorist organization and has a policy barring contact with its leaders. A senior Obama administration official said that policy hasn't changed, but that other players in the Mideast could act as intermediaries, as was the case when Egypt and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton worked to secure the November 2012 cease-fire. Egypt, Turkey or Qatar are all possibilities, said the official, who demanded anonymity to discuss sensitive diplomatic matters. Palestinian residents inspect damage caused by Israeli airstrikes in the Gaza Strip on Thursday . A plume of smoke and debris rises above the Gaza Strip after an Israeli airstrike . In the phone call, Obama condemned the rockets and said Israel has the right to self-defense, the White House said. Pro-Israel lawmakers in the U.S. and the State Department have insisted that Hamas is to blame for the fresh round of conflict. Obama also raised his concerns about Tariq Abu Khdeir, a Palestinian-American teenager who was detained and apparently beaten by Israeli authorities. 'The president expressed concern about the risk of further escalation and emphasized the need for all sides to do everything they can to protect the lives of civilians and restore calm. But he also urged both sides not to escalate the crisis,' the White House said in a statement. In a moment of drama at the U.N., Israel's ambassador suddenly played the piercing 15-second siren that warns Israelis to run to bomb shelters to escape rocket attacks to highlight the threat his country faces. Ron Prosor told the council that Hamas is 'intentionally and indiscriminately' threatening 3.5 million Israelis and 'no nation, no people and no government could tolerate this'. Palestinian U.N. envoy Riyad Mansour had no props for his appeal to the council 'to stop the bleeding' and revive the Palestinians' 'dying hopes' for an end to the conflict and peace with freedom. 'I speak on behalf of the suffering and grieving Palestinian people, who are enduring yet another barrage of death, destruction, trauma and terror,' he said. Yet he rejected Israel's 'audacious claims' that Palestinians are being used as human shields 'while it knowingly and intentionally strikes at densely populated civilian areas.' The Palestinians also reject Israel's claims to self-defense while 'it deliberately carries out reprisals and collective punishment' for the three Israeli teenagers' deaths, which the Palestinian leadership has condemned, he said. Diplomats said Jordan has circulated a press statement, which is not legally binding, for the Security Council's consideration that would call for a cease-fire. The secretary-general, who is engaged in intense global diplomacy over the crisis, called for 'bold thinking and creative ideas' to end the violence. 'Once again, Palestinian civilians are caught between Hamas' irresponsibility and Israel's tough response,' Ban said.","President calls on both sides to protect their citizens .

Scroll down for video . Deadly: A van crashed into a sports car head-on on Sunday afternoon. Five people were killed and two people were critically injured . Scene: The van, carrying five people, was trying to pass a vehicle when it struck a sports car, seen here . Both people in the sports car died after it burst into flames, and three of the van's passengers were killed, Trooper Evan Kirby told KSL-TV . The other two passengers in the van were sent to the hospital in critical condition. Lt. Scott Robertson encouraged safety while speaking to the affiliate station. 'Please slow down, wear your seat belt, don't get in a big hurry, make good passes,' he said. No names or other details were immediately released. The wreck occurred two days after a head-on collision involving a wrong-way driver on Interstate 80 in northern Utah killed three members of a family. Scene: Authorities were on hand Sunday afternoon as a crew cleaned up the deadly accident . Damage: People are seen cleaning up the crash near Monticello . According to troopers, Paul Mumford, 36, of West Jordan, inexplicably turned around Friday night and drove the wrong way before colliding with an SUV driven by Jose Adame-Orozco, 36, of Farmington. Three passengers in the SUV were pronounced dead at the scene: Adame-Orozco's girlfriend, Delphine John, 44, and her daughters, Deliah Ramirez, 18, and Anaya Orozco, 3. Adame-Orozco was listed in critical condition at a hospital, while Mumford's condition has been upgraded to stable at a hospital. Accident: A crash on Friday, pictured, killed three members of a family and was allegedly caused by a drunk driver . Investigators believe Mumford was driving under the influence at the time. Troopers say both drivers were traveling at least 80 mph and did not hit the brakes, because there were no skid marks. The impact of the collision was so powerful that troopers were left in disbelief. 'That's like hitting a brick wall at 160 miles per hour.

"By . Associated Press Reporter . A San Francisco Giants fan left brain damaged after being beaten in a Dodger Stadium parking lot won his negligence lawsuit on Wednesday. A jury agreed that the Dodgers did not provide adequate security and were partly to blame for the attack that left father-of-two Bryan Stow permanently disabled. Stow's father Dave said that his son probably wouldn't understand the details of the settlement that will give him nearly $15 million from the Dodgers, 'but Bryan will know that he got some help today.' Scroll down for video . Attack: Bryan Stow, pictured with his son and daughter, was left brain damaged after being beaten at a Dodger stadium . Suffering: Bryan Stow, pictured being helped into court in his wheelchair, still has seizures . 'He's not going to be 100 percent, maybe . for a long time, maybe never. What he gets is going to help him through . now, and that's what he needs,' Dave Stow said. The jury delivered its verdict in a Los Angeles courtroom after weeks of testimony about the assault after the opening day baseball game in 2011 between the rival teams. Stow, 45, was left with disabling brain damage and became a symbol of violence at sporting events. He was in the courtroom for part of the trial, his wheelchair positioned front and center so jurors could see the scars on his head where his skull was temporarily removed during medical efforts to save his life. Experts testified that the former Northern California paramedic Stow will never work again and has suffered repeated strokes and seizures. They said he will require round-the-clock care. Lawyers for Stow claimed the team and former owner Frank McCourt failed to provide adequate security. In split decisions, jurors found that the Dodgers were negligent but absolved McCourt. In civil cases, only nine of 12 jurors must agree on the verdict. Life-changing: Bryan Stow, pictured on a stretcher while being moved to a new hospital in 2011, still needs round-the-clock care . Closure: Stow's parents David, center, and Ann, right, said they were satisfied with the jury's decision . The Dodgers 'did have a (security) plan but somewhere along the line that plan broke. And it needed to be fixed,' juror Carlos Munoz said after the verdict. 'Hopefully we helped to fix it ... If you're going to own a stadium, do it right,' he added. Jurors determined that Stow suffered about $18 million in damages in the form of lost earnings, medical expenses, and pain and mental suffering. The Dodgers must pay about $15 million of that because while finding the team negligent, jurors assigned it only a portion of the responsibility for Stow's harm, said his attorney, Tom Girardi. Stow's attackers shared the rest of the responsibility for Stow's harm, jurors determined. However, they weren't sued and so cannot be required to pay a share of the damages. Stow's parents pronounced themselves satisfied with the jury's award even though it is only about half of what they had sought. 'We'll make it work for him,' his mother, Ann Stow, said. Trial: Dodger fans Louie Sanchez, not pictured, and Marvin Norwood, left, pleaded guilty to attacking Stow . Safety: Security has been bolstered at the Dodgers stadium in the wake of the 2011 attack . The defense had argued that security was stronger than ever at an opening day contest and contended that Stow was partially to blame because he was drunk. But jurors were unanimous in deciding that Stow's own negligence wasn't a substantial factor in causing his harm. Stow's mother said she held her husband's hand as the court read that part of the verdict form. 'I was so ecstatic because we know our son and we know that the picture the defense was trying to portray was not Bryan at all,' Ann Stow said. They said they had not spoken to their son, who did not attend the hearing, but did talk to his sisters and expected they would talk to him. In San Francisco, Giants manager Bruce Bochy said he was happy for the family that there was finally a verdict. 'What happened shouldn't have happened. We have to keep that in mind. But also for the fans coming to the ballpark, you need the proper security,' he said. 'It shouldn't be a situation where you're afraid to go to a game or you can't enjoy yourself.' Dodger fans Louie Sanchez and Marvin Norwood pleaded guilty to the attack in criminal court after a lengthy preliminary hearing in which witnesses said security guards were absent from the parking lot where Stow was attacked. The complicated civil case even threw jurors at one point, who announced last week that they were deadlocked. The judge ordered them to resume deliberations. 'They struggled through it,' Dana Fox, an attorney for the Dodgers, said after the verdict. 'Remember, after four days they had not found liability on the part of the defendants. That is quite telling, I think, in and of itself.' In the wake of the attack, the Dodgers and Los Angeles police increased their security at games, including adding more patrols and undercover officers wearing rival team jerseys.","Father-of-two Bryan Stow needs round-the-clock care after horrific beating .

"By . Associated Press Reporter . Embattled rancher Cliven Bundy must be held accountable for his role in a 'Wild West' standoff between his supporters and police last April over a land dispute, the U.S. Bureau of Land Management has said. Bundy, the last rancher in Clark County, Nevada, has been battling the BLM since 1993 when he refused to pay for the right to graze on the 600,000-acre Gold Butte land he says his family have owned since the 1870s. The BLM says Bundy . owes over $1 million in fees and penalties for trespassing on federal . property without a permit over 20 years, claiming he is destroying the arid and fragile . habitat of the endangered desert tortoise. The row culminated in April when more than 200 armed federal agents and snipers were deployed to the ranch to forcibly capture nearly 1,000 of his cattle. Scroll down for video . Standoff: Bundy, the last rancher in Clark County, Nevada, has been battling the BLM since 1993 when he refused to pay for the right to graze on the 600,000-acre Gold Butte land he says his family have owned since the 1870s. He today spoke at a prayer ceremony at a supporter camp located near the Virgin River Sunday . Prayer meeting: The showdown pitted Cliven Bundy's claims of ancestral rights to graze his cows on open range against federal claims that the cattle are trespassing on arid and fragile habitat of the endangered desert tortoise . But authorities were forced to retreat after his rag-tag militia of armed anti-federalists refused to back down. Clark . County Sheriff Doug Gillespie today said Bundy crossed the line when he . allowed states' rights supporters, including self-proclaimed militia . members, onto his property to aim guns at police. 'If . you step over that line, there are consequences to those actions,' Gillespie told the Las Vegas Review-Journal. 'And I believe they stepped . over that line. No doubt about it. They need to be held accountable for . it.' Bureau spokeswoman Celia Boddington, in a statement released Saturday to The Associated Press, agreed, saying the agency continues to pursue the matter 'aggressively through the legal system.' 'There is an ongoing investigation and we are working diligently to ensure that those who broke the law are held accountable,' she said, declining to elaborate. The FBI declined comment Saturday on its investigation. Bundy did not respond to a request for comment. Standoff: The row culminated in April when more than 200 armed federal agents and snipers were deployed to the ranch to forcibly capture nearly 1,000 of his cattle sparking a standoff with Bundy's armed supporters . My land: The Bureau of Land Management says Bundy owes over $1 million in fees and penalties for trespassing on federal property without a permit over 20 years . Support: Members of Anonymous Security stand in masks during the prayer ceremony at the Cliven Bundy supporter camp . A federal judge in Las Vegas first ordered Bundy in 1998 to remove 'trespass cattle' from land the bureau declared a refuge for the endangered desert tortoise. Bureau officials obtained court orders last year allowing the roundup. Boddington disputed Gillespie's contention the agency mishandled the roundup of Bundy's cattle 80 miles northeast of Las Vegas. The bureau backed down during the showdown with Bundy and his armed supporters, citing safety concerns, and released some 380 Bundy cattle collected during a weeklong operation from a vast arid range half the size of the state of Delaware. Gillespie blamed the bureau for escalating the conflict and ignoring his advice to delay the roundup after he had a confrontational meeting with Bundy's children a few weeks before it began. 'I came back from that saying, 'This is not the time to do this,' the sheriff told the Review-Journal. 'They said, 'We do this all the time. We know what we're doing. We hear what you're saying, but we're moving forward.'' Support: Bundy, whose ancestors settled in the area in the late 1800s, refuses to acknowledge federal authority on public lands . Armed: Many of Bundy's supporters were armed at the prayer meeting in his honour . Tensions further escalated early in the roundup after a video showed one of Bundy's sons being stunned with a Taser. The video drew militia members and others to Bundy's ranch. Bundy was not a hardened criminal, Gillespie told the newspaper. He was a rancher who stopped paying his fees, the sheriff said, and that was not worth risking violence. But Boddington said the bureau planned and conducted the roundup in 'full coordination' with Gillespie and his office. 'It is unfortunate that the sheriff is now attempting to rewrite the details of what occurred, including his claims that the BLM did not share accurate information,' she said. 'The sheriff encouraged the operation and promised to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with us as we enforced two recent federal court orders.' 'Sadly, he backed out of his commitment shortly before the operation - and after months of joint planning - leaving the BLM and the National Park Service to handle the crowd control that the sheriff previously committed to handling,' she added.","Bundyhas been battling the Bureau of Land Management since 1993 .

Sam Bompas travelled to Syracuse University in upstate New York to attempt to cook using Lava created by an 'artificial volcano'. Scroll down for video . Sam Bompas cooked on a lava flow which reached temperatures of 2,700F . Professor Robert Wysocki and his team at Syracuse University in upstate New York have customised a 3 million BTU bronze furnace bought used in Canada for $2500. To create lava, they start with Dresser Trap Rock and use the furnace, described as 'like a crock pot' to melt it. It takes about 60 hours to melt and degas approx. 800lbs of lava, which creates a flow lasting 7-9 minutes. The team has done 100 lava pours so far, for artistic and scientific . purposes, but had never actually used the lava’s 2,700°F heat to cook before. 'I've always been obsessed with volcanoes, and had a dream of being able to cook with lava,' he told Mailonline. 'We wanted to find a way to cook with it, and heard about Professor Robert Wysocki, who has spent five years working to perfect a technique to make lava in this furnace.' Bompas got in touch with Wysocki at Syracuse University in upstate New York, and he instantly agreed to help them. The researchers created an artificial flow of Lava for the team to cook on. The ultimate barbecue? Sam Bompas grills steak on the lava flow created from an artificial volcano . The finished steak and corn, which Bompas described as the best he'd ever eaten . Although it was the first time steak has been cooked on lava, the results mean that the chef hopes it won't be the last - and says cooking over lava could be the ultimate way to prepare steak. 'When you cook on a barbecue you get a ot of smoke. 'Because lava is pure heat, you get meat sealed v quickly, and with a very even char.' The team even developed a special technique, sealing the meat with an initial blast of lave, letting it rest, then finishing it off. A grill was clamped over the lava flow to allow the chef easy access . The 2,100F molten lava, which is created on site and then poured to recreate a lava flow . 'It was awesome - and totally delivers, in fact it was the best steak I've ever had in my life,' said Bompas. The firm now hope to develop the technique for an event. 'We are hoping we can scale the lava flow and do this elsewhere, we have big plans. 'We want to create a lava banquet for 500 people - you can combine education, thrill and have an experience you'll want to tell everyone about.' Robert Wysocki and his team at Syracuse University said 'After looking into them, I realized they were very serious, fun/insane and had pulled off some really ambitious projects. 'I found their commitment to their work to be as serious as I am to mine; I think they are operating in a new area of fine art installation involving entertainment, food, science, etc. all of which translates to an incredibly deep curiosity on their part. 'After the opening of their Museum of Sex installation in June they came up to Syracuse. 'After they saw their first but short pour of lava for a Nasa grant proof of concept; they went with my assistant to the grocery store and I went to the ice place; the result is what you see in the video'.

The event will showcase at least the new iPhone 6 with a 4.7-inch screen, but a final decision on debuting the larger, 5.5-inch 'phablet' model at the event has not been made, according to 9to5mac. Scroll down for video . Suppliers claim Apple has ordered between 70 and 80 million units combined for its rumoured, upcoming 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch iPhone 6s (leaked images pictured) by 30 December. The reports come after iPhone maker Foxconn confirmed it has hired 100,000 new workers to manufacture the gadgets . Although smartwatches are a relatively new tech trend, Apple was working on a version as far back as 2011, according to its latest patent. The files detail a wristband fitted with a detachable electronic touchscreen device. The shape and size of the device in the patent images resembles a sixth-generation iPod Nano and in one design, the word iTime is written on its face. 'Apple is gearing up for its first major hardware and software launches of 2014,' the site says. 'The Cupertino-based company is 'tentatively' planning a keynote address in mid-September to announce the iPhone 6 and provide final details on iOS 8, according to sources briefed on the plans.' However, the site also admitted the plans are 'in flux'. Apple is said to be so confident its upcoming iPhone 6 will be a success, it is rumoured to have ordered 80 million handsets by the end of the year. If true, this would be the largest initial production run of iPhones – up from 60 million for the iPhone 5S and 5C last year. Suppliers claim the Californian firm has asked for between 70 and 80 million units combined for the rumoured 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch iPhone 6s by 30 December. The reports come after iPhone maker Foxconn confirmed it has hired 100,000 new workers to manufacture the new gadgets. The 4.7-inch iPhone is . expected to go into production next week, with the larger 5.5inch version . set to start three weeks later. Apple has traditionally touted the benefits of smaller screens, and its devices typically have a 4-inch display. By increasing the size of its iPhone 6 handsets, Apple phones will be closer in size to those made by rival Samsung and HTC. Sources 'familiar with the matter' said: 'The different timetables have been set as Apple does not want to repeat the mistake it made in 2013 when it launched the iPhone 5S (pictured front) and iPhone 5C (pictured back) simultaneously' Synthetic sapphire is a hard, transparent material made of crystallising aluminium oxide, produced at high temperatures. As . the material is heated, it forms disks that can be sliced . using diamond-coated saws. These round disks are ground into shape, and . polished, to become glass. The technology is traditionally used in watch displays because it is thin, super-strong and scratch resistant. Apple already uses sapphire crystal in . the Touch ID fingerprint scanner on its latest iPhone 5S and to protects the phone's camera. As a result, sapphire glass could potentially replace Gorilla Glass currently used in most high-end smartphones. Apple's larger screens are expected to use in-cell technology that will make the screens thinner and lighter by adding touch sensors to the liquid crystal . display. Current models have a separate touchscreen layer. Elsewhere, the 5.5-inch iPhone screen is expected to be made of sapphire crystal, rather than glass. Due to the complex nature of these screens, reports claim Apple could even ask component makers to prepare for 120 million displays, to account for any faults and replacements that need to be issued. The Economic Daily said earlier this week Foxconn finally confirmed the rumours it would hire a huge number of staff. The report appears to contradict earlier claims the larger 'phablet' sized iPhone 6 won't ship until 2015. A . YouTube videomaker recently claimed to have acquired one of the sapphire screens - and has . subjected it to a barrage of abuse, from stabbing it with a knife and . keys to bending and twisting it. In the video, the screen emerges totally unscathed, raising hopes is could lead to a far more resilient handset from Apple. Marques . Brownlee, a popular YouTube host claims to have got the screen from . well known Apple leaker Sonny Dickson, who recently made his own video . showcasing the screen. In the video he can be seen bending and twisting the screen. 'I slowly realised there is absolutely no way I can break this display under my own power,' he said. 'The worst blemish on the surface was actually my fingerprint marks and the dust from handling it so much.' The . glass is also extremely high-quality, Brownlee noted: 'There’s . absolutely no colour shift while looking through the sapphire glass.' Apple . already uses a small amount of sapphire glass for the 'Home' button and . camera lens in the iPhone 5S, but the rest of the current iPhone front . display is made of Gorilla Glass. Apple's larger screens are expected to use in-cell technology that will make the screens thinner and lighter by adding touch sensors to the liquid crystal display.

Earlier this month, Nasa claimed that it has effectively ended the debate, saying the craft had finally, definitely left the sun's reach. However - a new study says that, in fact, that may not be the case - but researchers say they have finally developed a test that could end the debate once and for all. Scroll down for video . The Voyager 1 spacecraft . It is 37 years since the twin Voyager 1 and 2 spacecraft were launched and the pair continue to explore where nothing from Earth has flown before. Their primary mission was the exploration of Jupiter and Saturn. After making a string of discoveries there -- such as active volcanoes on Jupiter's moon Io and intricacies of Saturn's rings -- the mission was extended. Voyager 2 went on to explore Uranus and Neptune, and is still the only spacecraft to have visited those outer planets. The current mission for both spacecraft, the Voyager Interstellar Mission, is to explore the outermost edge of the Sun's domain and beyond. In 2012, the Voyager mission team announced that the Voyager 1 spacecraft had passed into interstellar space, traveling further from Earth than any other manmade object. Now, two Voyager team scientists have developed a test that they say could prove once and for all if Voyager 1 has crossed the boundary. The new test is outlined in a study accepted for publication in Geophysical Research Letters, a journal of the American Geophysical Union. The scientists predict that, in the next two years, Voyager 1 will cross the current sheet – the sprawling surface within the heliosphere where the polarity of the sun’s magnetic field changes from plus to minus. The spacecraft will detect a reversal in the magnetic field, proving that it is still within the heliosphere. But, if the magnetic field reversal doesn’t happen in the next year or two as expected, that is confirmation that Voyager 1 has already passed into interstellar space. 'The proof is in the pudding,' said George Gloeckler, a professor in atmospheric, oceanic and space sciences at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor and lead author of the new study. Gloeckler has worked on the Voyager mission since 1972 and has been a vocal opponent of the view that Voyager 1 has entered interstellar space. He said that, although the spacecraft has observed many of the signs indicating it may have reached interstellar space, like cosmic rays, Voyager 1 did not see a change in magnetic field that many were expecting. The heliosphere, in which the Sun and planets reside, is a large bubble inflated from the inside by the high-speed solar wind blowing out from the Sun. Pressure from the solar wind, along with pressure from the surrounding interstellar medium, determines the size and shape of the heliosphere.

Pressure from the solar wind, along with pressure from the surrounding interstellar medium, determines the size and shape of the heliosphere. The supersonic flow of solar wind abruptly slows at the termination shock, the innermost boundary of the solar system. The edge of the solar system is the heliopause. The bow shock pushes ahead through the interstellar medium as the heliosphere plows through the galaxy.

The bow shock pushes ahead through the interstellar medium as the heliosphere plows through the galaxy. 'This controversy will continue until it is resolved by measurements,' Gloeckler said. If the new prediction is right, 'this will be the highlight of my life,' he said. 'There is nothing more gratifying than when you have a vision or an idea and you make a prediction and it comes true.' The Voyager 1 and 2 spacecraft were launched in 1977 to study Jupiter and Saturn. The mission has since been extended to explore the outermost limits of the Sun’s influence and beyond. Voyager 2, which also flew by Uranus and Neptune, is on its way to interstellar space.Gloeckler and co-author, Len Fisk, also a professor in atmospheric, oceanic and space sciences at the University of Michigan, are basing their new test on a model they developed and published earlier this year in The Astrophysical Journal. The model assumes that the solar wind is slowing down and, as a result, that the solar wind can be compressed. Based on this assumption, the study says Voyager 1 is moving faster than the outward flow of the solar wind and will encounter current sheets where the polarity of the magnetic field will reverse, proving that the spacecraft has not yet left the heliosphere. The scientists predict this reversal will most likely happen during 2015, based on observations made by Voyager 1. 'If that happens, I think if anyone still believes Voyager 1 is in the interstellar medium, they will really have something to explain,” Gloeckler said. 'It is a signature that can’t be missed.'Ed Stone of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena and NASA’s Voyager Project Scientist said 'It is the nature of the scientific process that alternative theories are developed in order to account for new observations. 'This paper differs from other models of the solar wind and the heliosphere and is among the new models that the Voyager team will be studying as more data are acquired by Voyager.'","Researchers say they have developed a test that could end the debate .

Her boyfriend, Adrian Chavez, 22, who was also at the home, fled the scene and was apprehended five hours later, police said . A 3-year-old Colorado girl was shot and critically wounded by a 5-year-old boy on Monday with a handgun belonging to her mother's boyfriend, police said. Pueblo police said in a statement that a 9-year-old boy was playing with a handgun in the backyard of a home in the morning when he gave the firearm to the 5-year-old, who pointed it at the girl and fired, striking her once. The bullet entered and exited the toddler's body without breaking any bones, police said. She was airlifted to a Colorado Springs hospital where she was listed in critical but stable condition after having surgery, they added.

A 3-year-old girl was shot outside a home in Pueblo Monday morning . According to police, the girl was shot by a 5-year-old child, but it was another 9-year-old child who was able to get the gun from inside the home . Influential: The children said they learned how to operate a gun from video games . 'Chavez . will be charged with child abuse resulting in serious bodily injury for . the gun that was left unattended,' police said, adding that he had an . outstanding, no-bond warrant for failure to appear in court in an . unrelated case. The initial investigation indicates that a 9-year-old child was able to get hold of a handgun that was in the home. The 9-year-old was in the backyard of the Colfax home with the other children and was able to manipulate the gun. The gun was then handled by a 5-year-old who pointed it at the 3-year-old and pulled the trigger. When the 9-year-old was asked how he was able to manipulate the handgun, he said he learned it from video games like 'Black Ops.' Neighbors say the tragedy didn’t surprise them. 'None whatsoever,' neighbor Michelle Hernandez said to KRDO news.  Her husband agreed. 'We thought it would more likely be a kidnapped kid or a kid getting run over in the street,' Matthew Hernandez said. The child was shot a single time, and the bullet entered and exited without breaking any bones . The victim was flown to a hospital in Colorado Springs for treatment. She¿s listed in critical but stable condition . The Hernandez’s say it was common to see the kids running around, unsupervised for hours.  The couple was so concerned about them that last week they say they contacted the Department of Social Services. 'I don’t know if it was naïve to think that OK, I called the Department of Social Services, I emailed a director, surely something will happen…they’ll step in the house, they’ll intervene,' Matthew said. But they say they never saw a caseworker pull up to the home.  So when they saw police today, there were regrets. 'I think we should have called the police.  I regret not doing that first to have them do a welfare check,' Michelle said. Police say the five and nine-year-old boys won't face any charges because of their age. Investigators are still deciding if the girl's mother should be charged.

"By . Ted Thornhill . and Reuters . The trial in China of a British corporate investigator and his American wife and business partner arrested a year ago after they did work for GlaxoSmithKline PLC will be closed to the public, two family friends with knowledge of the matter said. The detention of Peter Humphrey and Yu Yingzeng has sent shockwaves through the foreign business community. For years, the community has relied on investigative firms such as the couple's Shanghai-based company ChinaWhys to better understand the Chinese business environment. In April 2013, GSK employed ChinaWhys to investigate an ex-employee suspected of sending anonymous emails, including the circulation of an intimate video of former GSK China head Mark Reilly with his girlfriend, as well as emails containing allegations of widespread bribery at the British drugmaker. Peter Humphrey and Yingzeng Yu appeared on China's central broadcaster CNTV apparently admitting to illegally gathering personal information on individuals in China . Three months later, authorities detained Humphrey and Yu for illegally buying and selling private information. Chinese authorities have not openly made a link between GSK and the case against ChinaWhys. The couple were subsequently arrested, which typically means the police believe they have enough evidence for the case to be brought to trial. Last year Mr Humphrey and Ms Yu reportedly appeared on China's central broadcaster CNTV admitting to their 'crimes'. According to The Times, they appeared on television in handcuffs and wearing orange vests, with their faces blurred. In the broadcast Humphrey says: 'To obtain this information, I sometimes used illegal means. 'I want to apologize to the Chinese government.' James Zimmerman, managing partner of the Beijing office of the law firm Sheppard Mullin Richter & Hampton, said: 'The opaque nature of the investigation and detention of the Humphreys is troubling at best and puts a serious chilling effect on legitimate efforts to investigate even benign, public information.' They are being held in Shanghai, but it is not known in which court they will be tried. U.S. consular officials had been informed on Wednesday when visiting Yu that they would not be able to attend the trial, and that the decision to keep the trial closed had been made on the grounds of privacy, according to the couple's family friends, who declined to be identified because of the apparent sensitivity of the case. The trial date has also been pushed back a week to August 7 from July 29, the people said. The U.S. and British consulates declined to comment. Probe: Mr Humphrey was investigating a sex tape scandal involving GSK's Mark Reilly (pictured) In China, court cases involving state secrets or national security are regularly closed to the public. However, the couple's son said in a statement this case involved neither, according to Reuters. 'I am very worried that family and consular officials are not allowed to attend my parents' trial. This does not involve state secrets. This does not involve national security,' Harvey Humphrey, 19, said in the statement to media. 'I am surprised at this decision since China wants to promote openness and the rule of law and I hope that they will let me in.' One of the family friends said the defendants' lawyers had been required by the prosecutor to sign non-disclosure agreements. 'The client doesn't even know what's going on,' the person said. The reason for the non-disclosure agreements was not clear, but underscore the sensitivity of the case. Officials contacted by telephone at the Shanghai procuratorate and municipal intermediate courts said they did not know about the case. There was no listing of the trial on August 7 or July 29 on an online docket for all of Shanghai's courts. China's foreign ministry did not immediately respond to faxed requests for comment. Chinese authorities last month charged Reilly and other colleagues with corruption, after a government investigation found the firm made billions of yuan from elaborate schemes to bribe doctors. GSK's tangled web of problems in China were highlighted in a lengthy draft report seen by Reuters. The report had been prepared by ChinaWhys and presented to GSK on June 6 Last year. The report into the origin of the video and emails did not reach a conclusion as to who was behind the actions. Humphrey previously worked for Reuters in Asia, Eastern Europe and the Balkans, according to the website of ChinaWhys.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . and Reuters . More than 46,000 drug offenders will be eligible for early release from federal prison under an amendment to sentencing guidelines passed on Friday by a U.S. judiciary agency - unless Congress blocks the change. The U.S. Sentencing Commission voted unanimously to make 46,290 drug offenders eligible for review by federal judges to determine if the sentences can be reduced without jeopardizing public safety. The commission expects eligible candidates to receive an average of 25 months off of their sentences beginning in November 2015, making retroactive an amendment to sentencing guidelines passed earlier this year. Mandatory: More than 46,000 non-violent drug offenders could be released from federal prisons like Butner Federal prison in North Carolina . Early release: Attorney General Eric Holder announces that tens of thousands of non-violent drug offenders are now eligible for early release . Congress has the authority to block both amendments by Nov. 1 of this year. 'Making these new guidelines retroactive will offer relief to thousands of people who received overly harsh sentences under the old sentencing guidelines,' said Jesselyn McCurdy, senior legislative counsel at the American Civil Liberties Union, which has advocated sentencing reform. Support for efforts to reduce sentences has grown in Congress and the Obama administration as U.S. crime rates have declined dramatically from levels three decades ago. Attorney General Eric Holder issued a memo in August 2013 telling federal prosecutors they should no longer pursue mandatory minimum sentences for certain low-level, nonviolent drug offenders. Bipartisan: Conservative Utah Senator Mike Lee co-sponsored a bill that would end mandatory minimum sentences for non-violent drug offenders . Mandy Martinson is serving 15 years in federal prison for helping her dealer-boyfriend in exchange for feeding her methamphetamine addiction. The judge did not agree with her sentence . Weldon Angelos is serving a mandatory 55 years in prison for selling a few pounds of marijuana while possessing a firearm . A bill in Congress that would eliminate mandatory minimum sentences for nonviolent drug offenders has strong bipartisan support, including from conservative Senator Mike Lee, who sponsored the bill. 'It is as if all the branches of government woke up this year and figured out something that had to be done about the problems associated with over-incarceration,' said Mary Price, general counsel for Families Against Mandatory Minimums. Opponents of sentencing reform include law enforcement officers, prosecutors and some lawmakers, who warn that reducing sentences could cause crime rates to rise. A majority of U.S. Attorneys opposed the amendment passed Friday, according to a source familiar with the process, on the grounds that they did not want change drug sentences previously handed down. Holder, however, applauded the commission's decision in a statement released Friday. At the state level, including such conservative places as Texas and South Carolina, sentences for drug offenders have been cut to address overcrowding in prisons and stretched budgets. Research from the Pew Charitable Trusts shows that reductions in those states' prison populations have had no effect on public safety.","The U.S. Sentencing Commission voted unanimously to make 46,290 drug offenders eligible for review by federal judges .

"By . Reuters . and Daily Mail Reporter . Rupert Murdoch is determined to add Time Warner Cable to his media empire. The cable company recently rejected his initial $80billion bid from 21st Century Fox, but apparently Murdoch is ready to up the ante above $85 a share, sources told Bloomberg News. If accepted, the takeover would be the biggest media deal in more than a decade. Scroll down for video . Not over yet: Rupert Murdoch's $80billion bid to take over cable company Time Warner Cable was rejected, but sources say he will bid again. Pictured above on Wednesday, speaking at the B20 conference in Sydney . The move could create a mega-sized . media conglomerate that owns rights to dozens of popular TV shows and . thousands of films, as well as cable TV networks and local broadcast TV . channels. Such a company . would be a content provider powerful enough to aggressively negotiate . with cable companies and internet service providers. It's estimated that Fox would save nearly $1billion annually by eliminating overlapping staff. Murdoch also criticised 'subservient politicians stifling economic growth' as he spoke at a meeting of the Business 20 leaders in Sydney . Details of the Time Warner Cable bid were released this week just one day before Murdoch appeared at a B20 conference in Sydney, Australia and criticized the excessive financial red tape in free market economies. If Murdoch proceeds with the Time Warner Cable takeover, it would be heavily scrutinized by antitrust regulators. Fox would likely have to sell CNN to appease the regulators since the company already has it's own 24-hour news network. He says that the G20 governments need to 'take a back seat' and allow businesses to drive economic growth. He said U.S. President Barack Obama was penalising businesses by cracking down on so-called 'profit shifting' by major corporations to countries with lighter tax regimes, a technique that is also in the sights of the G20. 'My blood pressure goes up when I think of the number of local, state and federal regulations we have in our lives today,' the 83-year-old Australian billionaire told the meeting. 'That is just in America. Don't even get me started on the European Union.' Murdoch, who did not refer to the Time Warner . bid during the meeting, has his eye on the media conglomerate, which owns CNN, HBO, Warner Brothers, among other big-name media properties. Experts say he isn't likely to give up after one rejection. Sources told Bloomberg that Murdoch hasn't been directly involved in the discussions. The B20 was set up in 2010 to give policy recommendations on behalf of the international business community to the G20. Murdoch was speaking at the meeting a day after it was revealed his Twenty-First Century Fox Inc made an $80 billion offer for Time Warner Inc, which was rejected . Business leaders meeting here are looking to influence the outcome of the G20 Leaders Summit in Brisbane in November. Murdoch . told the meeting: 'I believe that business does have a role in shaping . public policy, mainly in helping limit the size and scope of government. 'For . businesses large and small, there's simply too much red tape, too many . subservient politicians stifling economic growth and entrepreneurism.' The G20 is targeting growth of two per cent above trend over the next five years. It . is also tackling corporate 'profit shifting', which has allowed . multinationals such as Starbucks Corp, Google Inc, Apple Inc and . Amazon.com Inc to avoid paying taxes. G20 finance ministers in February endorsed a set of common standards for sharing bank account information across borders, with automatic exchange of information among G20 members to take effect by the end of 2015. Obama, meanwhile, earlier this year proposed tightening restrictions on U.S. multinationals that shift their tax domiciles abroad in his 2015 budget. Obama wants to raise the minimum level of foreign ownership in a newly inverted holding company to 50 per cent from about 20 per cent, making the deals more difficult to carry out. 'Do we really expect overseas companies to voluntarily bring profits back to be taxed at 35 to 40 percent in the United States, when the corporate tax rate in Ireland is 12.5 per cent?' Murdoch said. 'This is not the way to achieve economic growth.'","Sources say Murdoch will make a second bid to buy Time Warner Cable .

"By . Reuters . and Daily Mail Reporter . A New Jersey amusement park that was as famous for the many lawsuits brought against it as it was for its rides, with no fewer than six people losing their lives there and 110 people reported injuries in a single year. Since it closed in 1996, Action Park became the stuff of urban legend and nostalgia, even inspiring a documentary called 'The Most Insane Amusement Park Ever.' And as of June 14, Action Park is back, complete with a new attraction, the Zero G, which drops riders through a trapdoor and down a 100-foot-high slide, which Action Park's owners says is the tallest of its kind. Scroll down for video . Notorious: The 'most insane amusement park ever,' Action Park is back in, well, action . Nostalgia: Children of the 1980s and '90s remember Action Park with equal parts fondness and fear . 'At Action Park, it felt like you were in some crazy guy’s backyard,' Dave Schlussman, a 30-year-old from Greenpoint, told the New York Post. 'The rides defied any kind of procedure.' The rural resort drew thousands of revelers everyday from 1978 until 1996 in spite of - or maybe because of - its freewheeling reputation for danger. 'We'd race some unsuspecting guy on the Alpine Slide,' said Dana Bornstein, 44, who worked at the park as a teenager in the 1980s. 'We'd be at the bottom and see the cart come down by itself. Next thing you know, they'd be bringing the guy to first aid.' Bornstein was one of roughly 100 former employees who gathered for a reunion at the legendary water park on Saturday to celebrate its rechristening. Action Park closed in 1996 and reopened two years later as Mountain Creek. Owners decided to switch back to the original name in an attempt to capitalize on the nostalgia - some might say notoriety - of its earlier heyday. Safety first: The newly-opened Action Park adheres to the New Jersey Department of Community Affairs regulations . Write caption here . One of the first waterparks in the country, Action Park opened in 1978, sometimes introducing new attractions almost as soon they were invented. 'Pretty much any backyard inventor with a crazy idea knew this was the place to try it out,' said Bill Benneyan, president of Mountain Creek Resort, which owns Action Park. One such ride was only in action for a month before it was shut down. The Cannonball Loop was a water slide with a 360-degree loop at the end. A man who claims his father built the slide told Buzzfeed that stories about dismembered crash-test dummies are completely true. 'The story about the dummies is completely true! They used the dummies to test several of the rides at the park and every time a dummy came off the ride dismembered they would try it again until it stayed in one piece, then they would pay someone to test it!' he said. Video Source Fox New York . The Cannonball Loop: The slide with it's 360-degree loop was short-lived, in action only a month before it caused too many injuries and was shut down . Fun for the whole family: Despite its safety track record, Action Park is remembered with fondness by many children of the '80s and '90s . Matt Weismantel, who worked at the park from 1979 to 1984 recounted watching operators turn on the wave pool (also known as the 'grave pool', at the time one of the first in the country, for the first time. He heard a scream and saw a woman clinging to the side of the wall, her feet above the water. 'She didn't realize that when the wave went through, there'd be nothing underneath her,' Weismantel said. The park earned a reputation for danger and six people died there from 1980 to 1987. News accounts from the New Jersey Herald in the 1980s reported hundreds of lawsuits in little more than a few years. The Alpine Slide was the site of 26 head injuries and 14 fractures in a two-year period. Executives at the newly renamed Action Park hope they can resurrect that reputation for risk without the actual danger. The Alpine Slide and a seldom-used waterslide known as the Cannonball Loop have been removed. Reporter Anna Gilligan recently took the plunge on the High Anxiety ride and lived to tell the tale . In a tour of the park on Saturday, Benneyan stressed that the state inspects rides at the beginning and end of the season, plus conducts periodic checks during the season. Some of the former employees expressed a sense of nostalgia for a time when kids and teenagers roamed free and a little bit of danger was associated with growing up. 'When you are the first to do something, you do it without regulation,' said Amy Rude, 39, who worked at the park from 1990 to 1995. 'Action Park is from a moment in time that can never happen again.' Former park employee Mike Donahan, 40, remembers seeing wipeouts on the Alpine Slide that left kids with scrapes severe enough to require a trip to the first-aid office but not immobilizing enough to keep them from soon returning to the same ride. 'They'd be bleeding and jump right into the pools,' he said. 'I don't even know how much chlorine they put in the pool.'","Action Park re-opened on June 15 .

"By . Michael Zennie . and Reuters . Federal judges have struck down gay marriage bans in Indiana and Utah today in a pair of ruling that granted massive victories for same-sex couples and could force same-sex unions on four other states that currently ban them. In Indiana, a judge threw out the state's prohibition on gay marriages and ordered county clerks to immediately begin issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples. The ruling against Utah, one of the most conservative states in the nation, was more sweeping, though less immediate. The 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Denver, in ruling against Utah's gay marriage ban, said categorically that states cannot ban same sex unions because they are protected under the 14th Amendment of the Constitution, which guarantees equal protection under the law. Indiana has begun issuing marriage licenses to same sex couples - while Utah's constitutional ban on gay marriage remains in place, pending appeal . Celebration: Craig Bowen, left, and  Jake Miller kiss after being married by Marion County Clerk Beth White, center, in Indianapolis following the federal judge's ruling . Rushing in: Erin Lynae Fox, right, kisses Jennifer Elizabeth Fox as their sons Isaac, 7, left, and Redmond, 4, look on following their wedding in Indianapolis . The ruling affects six states in the 10th Circuit, Colorado, Kansas, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Utah and Wyoming - making such prohibitions illegal there, too. New Mexico already allows gay marriage, but the remaining states have laws prohibiting it. However, the three judge panel immediately put their ruling on hold pending appeal, which the Utah Attorney General has promised to file. The next step is for the U.S. Supreme Court to take up the issue again. 'A state may not deny the issuance of a marriage license to two persons, or refuse to recognize their marriage, based solely upon the sex of the persons in the marriage union,' the 10th Circuit said in its 2-1 ruling on Utah. Supporters of gay marriage in the conservative state, where the Mormon church wields substantial political and social influence, planned a celebratory rally on Wednesday night in Salt Lake City. Utah briefly became the 18th U.S. state where marriage rights were extended to same-sex couples when a federal district judge ruled in December 2013 that a state ban on gay matrimony was unconstitutional. That decision was put on hold by the U.S. Supreme Court pending appeals, but not before more than 1,300 gay and lesbian couples tied the knot. Celebrating in Utah: From left, plaintiffs Moudi Sbeity, Derek Kitchen, Laurie Wood and Kody Partridge, two of the three couples who brought the lawsuit against Utah's gay marriage ban, stand together at a news conference outside their lawyer's office in Salt Lake City . Sarah Perfetti, right, and Abby Henkel, left, are married outside the Monroe County Justice Building on Wednesday in Bloomington, Indiana . Utah lawmakers who oppose gay marriage had argued that the state's ban, known as Amendment 3, was approved by voters and that same-sex marriages were new enough that evidence about their impact on families might not fully be known. But the court said the state could not restrict the right to marry, or its recognition of marriage, 'based on compliance with any set of parenting roles, or even parenting quality.' 'We cannot embrace the contention that children raised by opposite-sex parents fare better than children raised by same-sex parents,' it said in its ruling. Separately, U.S. District Judge Richard Young in Indianapolis said Indiana's ban on same-sex marriage violated the Constitution's due process and equal protection clauses, and he ordered officials to start issuing marriage licenses. And a legal battle over Florida's gay marriage ban intensified this week as state Attorney General Pam Bondi said she will defend the measures approved by voters in 2008 in challenges to be heard soon in Orlando and Miami Beach. Indiana Attorney General Greg Zoeller has promised to appeal the ruling and asked he judge to stay his ruling and halt gay marriage in Indiana, pending the appeal.","Federal judge strikes down Indiana gay marriage ban and orders county clerks to begin issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples .

"By . Reuters . Atlantic City's troubled Revel Casino Hotel has filed its second bankruptcy in just over a year and said it is hunting for a buyer. The casino, which had gone through Chapter 11 bankruptcy in March 2013, warned employees on Thursday that it would lay them all off from August 18 if it could not find a buyer, according to a letter sent to staff and obtained by Reuters. It is the latest bit of bad news for the New Jersey seaside city, which has lost gambling customers as venues in nearby states expand. Uncertain future: Revel Casino Hotel in Atlantic City, New Jersey filed for bankruptcy protection Thursday, warning employees that the $2.4 billion resort could close as soon as August 18 if a buyer can't be found in bankruptcy court . Revel said it was seeking a buyer who would 'have the ability to provide the funding and long-term commitment to help Revel reach its full potential.' The casino said in its staff letter it would shut its doors if it could not find one. The company said in a statement it will continue to operate normally while in bankruptcy. 'We will work to reach an agreement with a new owner who ... shares our commitment to providing Revel’s guests and players an exceptional experience,' Scott Kreeger, president and chief operating officer, said in the statement. When it opened in April 2012, Revel, built for $2.4 billion, was a centerpiece of New Jersey Governor Chris Christie's effort to bring Las Vegas-quality gambling to Atlantic City's declining gaming business. Christie had provided a $261 million tax package to help build Revel after Morgan Stanley, which had begun building the casino, pulled out of the project two years ago and took a $932 million loss. Revel never lived up to financial projections, filing for bankruptcy in March 2013 and emerging two months later. Not all fun and games: A dealer watches as gamblers place bets on a roulette table at Revel Casino Hotel in Atlantic City, New Jersey . In deep: The HQ day club at Revel Casino Hotel in Atlantic City recently opened, but the casino could close this summer if a buyer cannot be found . Casino revenue from Atlantic City has roughly halved since 2007, while total US casino revenue in 2012 was still shy of a 10-year peak of $37.5 billion in 2007, according to the American Gaming Association. Compression in big gambling markets like Atlantic City can be attributed in part to increased efforts by states to expand their own gambling offerings in search of new revenue sources, CIT's Steve Epperly said in a report this week. In Philadelphia, only about an hour's drive from Atlantic City, a court this week paved the way for more gambling, rejecting an effort to block a gaming license. Revel's workers, who in June voted to unionize with Unite-HERE Local 54, supported the search for a buyer. 'We believe a sale of Revel to a buyer who wants to keep the property open and retain the employees is the best thing for the workers,' Unite-HERE President Bob McDevitt said.

"By . Reuters . and Associated Press . The families of a dozen of the 19 elite Arizona firefighters killed last year in the nation's worst wildfire in eight decades have filed a wrongful-death lawsuit claiming the state was negligent in its efforts to battle the massive blaze. The wind-whipped, lightning-caused fire destroyed scores of homes and burned 8,400 acres (1900 hectares) before it was extinguished in an area around the tiny town of Yarnell, northwest of Phoenix. The deadly blaze captured the nation's attention for weeks and marked the greatest loss of life from a U.S. wildfire since 1933. Scroll down for video . Heroes: A group photograph shows members of the Prescott Granite Mountain Hotshots . The lawsuit seeks unspecified damages for the lives lost in the so-called Yarnell Hill Fire including compensation for funeral costs, pain and suffering, and lost income. The families are also demanding answers to what happened to cause all but one of the Granite Mountain hotshots firefighters to be overrun by flames on June 30. 'They want to know what happened to their loved ones and they want to ensure that this tragedy never happens again,' Phoenix attorney Patrick McGroder III, who is representing the families in the lawsuit, said. The families had notified the state, Yavapai County and the Central Yavapai Fire District of a possible lawsuit in December, offering to settle for more than $220 million. Highly trained: Members of the Granite . Mountain Hotshots (pictured last year) had been fighting wildfire in New . Mexico and elsewhere in Arizona . Family members also seek a meeting with state fire officials to see what went wrong and with hopes of developing policies, procedures and other tools to change the way fires are currently fought, according to the suit filed late on Wednesday in Maricopa County Superior Court in Phoenix. McGroder said the state rebuffed efforts . by the families to talk openly and honestly about the fire that trapped . the Hotshots in a brush-choked canyon outside Yarnell, destroyed 127 . homes and scorched 13 square miles. Named as defendants are the state and its forestry division, Yavapai County and the Central Yavapa County Fire District. Also listed are the fire officials who were responsible for managing firefighting efforts in the days leading up to the time when the 19 men were killed. The defendants named in the lawsuit either declined comment Thursday or did not immediately respond to requests for comment. An . attorney for the Central Yavapai Fire District, Nick Cornelius, said in . December that he didn't believe there is a basis for claims against the . agency or its staff. Killed: Granite Mountain Interagency Hotshot Crew from Prescott, Arizona were killed while battling an out-of-control wildfire. It was the nation's biggest loss of firefighters in a wildfire in 80 years . Tragedy: Winds from a thunderstorm fanned the flames toward the tragic 19 hotshots, but fire chiefs did not pull out their men in time . The deadline to file a lawsuit is . Monday, the one-year anniversary of the firefighters' deaths. Earlier . this week, more than 160 property owners in and around Yarnell sued the . state, saying it failed miserably in its management of the . lightning-sparked blaze. An earlier investigation . commissioned by the Arizona State Forestry Division found that state . fire officials communicated poorly but followed proper procedures when . the Hotshots were killed. This is the latest legal action taken in connection with the fallout from the fire, with 162 affected property owners filing a lawsuit this week seeking compensation for their losses. Owners also said fire officials were to blame for the loss of property and lives in the area, saying that they 'failed miserably'. A state official declined to comment on the lawsuit. Destroyed: The report said that by keeping crews on the mountain they were prioritizing the safety of property before the lives of its firefighters . Gov. Jan Brewer used caution in addressing potential lawsuits earlier this month. She said the agencies that produced the reports did a good job and that the deaths were an unfortunate, horrific tragedy that might spur change. 'I think that eventually it will come to the conclusion that certain, possibly different methods, techniques — call it what you wish — will be improved,' she said. The families' lawsuit contends that fire managers didn't act quickly enough to extinguish the blaze, failed to have adequate air resources and staff on hand, didn't make the safety of firefighters a top priority and did not alert the Hotshots to the erratic fire behavior and wind that day. The plaintiffs in the lawsuit filed in Maricopa County Superior Court include widows and fathers of 12 of the 19 Hotshots. Relief: The wife of at least one of the 13 Granite Mountain Hotshots who died in last summer's raging Arizona wildfires and were subsequently denied survivor's benefits by the city of Prescott will now get the money to help support herself and their four kids . Missed: She had been married to Andrew Ashcraft, pictured, for seven years and they have four children . They are: Claire Caldwell, Krista . Carter, Michael Mackenzie, Grant McKee, Daniel Parker, John Percin, . Desiree Steed, Stephanie Turbyfill, Roxanne Warneke, Carl Whitted and . Joseph Woyjeck. Juliann . Ashcraft is also suing who last month won the right to receive . survivor's benefits from the city of Prescott to help support herself . and their four kids. In . 2012, President Barack Obama made federal health insurance benefits . available to thousands of temporary wildland firefighters and their . families after a South Dakota-based Hotshot crew petitioned for the . change. That benefit did not extend to the Granite Mountain Hotshots because the crew was employed by Prescott. Somewhat . lost in the emotion of the debate is that benefits for all the families . of the Granite Mountain Hotshots also will include private donations. Each . of firefighters' families were set to receive a tax-free $328,000 lump . sum from the federal government, Social Security benefits, workers . compensation and free tuition for their children at Arizona . universities. The families . of the six full time employees also get health insurance, an increased . life insurance payment and the men's annual salaries.","The Yarnell Hill blaze killed 19 firefighters, called 'hotshots' in June 2013 .

A Washington state judge ruled on Friday that Kasem's care would be decided by his daughter, Kerri, and not her stepmother Jean. This ruling ended a protracted legal battle that was responsible for many highly publicized moments, such as the incident of May 13 where custody of Kasem was taken by Kerri from Jean at a home in Kitsap County, Washington.

"By . Reuters . An Alaska volcano that has been spewing ash and lava for years began erupting with new intensity this week, pushing a plume of smoke and ash as high as 24,000 feet (7,315 meters) and prompting scientists to issue their highest volcanic alert in five years, authorities said on Tuesday. But the intense action at the Pavlof Volcano, located in an uninhabited region nearly 600 miles (966 km) southwest of Anchorage, has so far not disrupted any regional air traffic, thanks to favorable weather that has made it easier for flights to navigate around the affected area. Still, the eruption was intense enough for Alaska Volcano Observatory scientists to issue their first red alert warning since 2009, when the state's Mount Redoubt had a series of eruptions that spewed ash 50,000 feet (15,240 meters). Red alert: Smoke pours from the erupting Pavlof Volcano on the Alaska Peninsula . 'This means it can erupt for weeks or even months,' observatory research geologist Michelle Coombs said of the warning. 'I don't think we will be at red for that long, but we are expecting it to go for a while based on its past.' Coombs said affected areas are uninhabited except for some hunting destinations. Geologists first issued the alert late on Monday. Since then plumes reached as high as 24,000 feet (7,315 meters) on Tuesday morning. On the map: The volcano is located in an uninhabited region nearly 600 miles (966 km) southwest of Anchorage . Plumes are created when lava bursts from the crater of the 8,261-foot (2,517-meter) volcano, then falls back on glacier ice, Coombs said. 'Right now, with the weather clear, it's just putting on a good show,' Coombs said. 'We're getting a lot of pilot reports and a lot of good photos, so we're able to keep a good eye on it.' Pavlof lies below a route frequently used by jetliners flying between North America and Asia, but those planes generally fly at elevations of 30,000 feet (9,144 meters) and likely would be unaffected by ash at lower elevations, observatory scientists have said.","Pavlof Volcano is located in an .

"By . Reuters . More than 100 members of three feuding gangs were arrested in Harlem for killings and gun violence on Wednesday in what was described as the largest indictment of gang members in New York City's history, authorities said. The arrests and indictments were part of a conspiracy investigation that stemmed from the 2011 murder of Tayshana Murphy, an 18-year-old high-school basketball star, a person familiar with the investigation said. Hundreds of New York City police officers, many heavily armed, swarmed the Manhattanville and Grant Houses in the early morning hours. The coordinated action began at approximately 6 a.m. when teams of cops from gang divisions across the city donned helmets and carried battering rams as they simultaneously stormed several apartments . Arrested: More than 100 people have been indicted over their alleged connection to three rival gangs in Manhattan . Cleaning the place up: Local residents say it's good to see police cracking down in their neighborhood . Those arrested included some of the most . dangerous gang members accused of terrorizing residents of the housing . complexes, according to police. More than 400 NYPD cops flooded the . neighboring Manhattanville and Grant Houses, near Amsterdam Avenue and . West 125th Street around 5:30 a.m. There were 103 arrests in the sweep, of those, 41 were already in jail on other charges, police sources said. NYPD Commissioner Bill Bratton was at the 33rd Precinct station house and addressed officers before the early-morning raid, sources said. 'This is one of the biggest takedowns in NYPD history,' a police source told the New York Post. Arrested: Many have already been indicted in a conspiracy case and are expected to be arraigned on charges that include conspiracy to commit murder . The gangs are accused of two homicides, 19 non-fatal shootings and about 50 other shooting incidents, according to a brief announcement from the Manhattan district attorney. Further details were expected to be announced at a news conference on Wednesday afternoon. Prosecutors have said the murder of Murphy, a nationally ranked point guard nicknamed 'Chicken,' was the most widely reported casualty of an often violent feud between gangs from neighboring public apartment buildings in Harlem. Although two young men have already been . convicted for Murphy's murder, investigators broadened their inquiry . into a pattern of violence they said were plaguing the neighborhood in . upper Manhattan. Murphy’s murder prompted authorities to tackle this years-long probe that ended in Wednesday morning’s sweep,. Justice: Investigators say the gangs are responsible for more than 20 shootings and two murders, including the killing of Tayshana 'Chicken' Murphy in 2011 . Murphy was shot three times, in her . wrist, hip and chest, at about 4 a.m. in a hallway of her Grant Houses . apartment building on September 11, 2011. Her murder came after a long evening of fighting between the gangs, prosecutors said at the time. Tyshawn . Brockington, 24, and Robert Cartagena, 23, who were associated with a . gang in the Manhattanville Houses project, were convicted for Murphy's . murder and sentenced to between 25 years and life in prison. In her honor: Prosecutors were able to link the suspects to violent acts that occurred before and after the Murphy shooting . Locking up: Officials say 103 people were indicted by prosecutors, 41 of whom are already in jail on other charges . No messing: More than 400 officers took part in the raids with Police Commissioner William Bratton (seventh from right) addressing the officers beforehand .

Some of those who were arrested this morning were laughing as police lead them out in handcuffs . One of them shouted, 'Happy Stack Day!' referring to his gang, the 'Staccs.' Members of the 'Make it Happen Boyz' and 'Money Avenue' were the other groups caught up in the raid.Wednesday’s raid was led by the NYPD’s Organized Crime Control Bureau, Narcotics Division, Housing, and the Manhattan Gang Unit. They were also joined by investigators from the Manhattan District Attorney’s office. Wake-up call: Some of those people were taken into custody during an early morning police raid on two housing projects in Harlem . Police brought out two men the Manhattanville housing complex as Police Commissioner Bratton looked on. 'We ain't no f--king gang. I ain't in no f--king gang,' a man identified by his mother as Isaac Waterman, 20, said as police walked him in cuffs to a waiting police van. 'Y'all just f--king up my life,' he yelled. Dozens of the charged gang members will face first-degree conspiracy counts on which they'll face a max of 25 years to life in prison. Their arraignments are expected to begin Thursday in Manhattan Supreme Court.

"By . Associated Press . and Reuters . Gay couples are racing to pick up marriage licenses in Pennsylvania now that a ban on the practice was struck down Tuesday. County offices in Philadelphia are staying open late to give out applications. The office in Pittsburgh is taking applications online. Finding the state's 1996 Defense of Marriage Act unconstitutional, U.S. District Court Judge John Jones III wrote: 'By virtue of this ruling, same-sex couples who seek to marry in Pennsylvania may do so.' Overturned and overjoyed: Ashley Wilson, left, and Lindsay Vandermay, right, both 29, kiss after getting their marriage license at the Philadelphia Marriage Bureau in City Hall on Tuesday after Pennsylvania's ban on gay marriage was overturned by a federal judge . Pictured: Pennsylvania became the 19th state to legalize gay marriage on Tuesday. In doing so, it joined every other state in the Northeastern U.S. Judge Jones was confirmed by the U.S. Senate back in 2002, in part at the urging of conservative vocal gay marriage opponent and presidential also-ran Rick Santorum, who was serving his second term as a Senator. The ruling makes Pennsylvania the 19th U.S. state where gay marriage is allowed, a movement that has gained momentum since the Supreme Court ruled last June that legally married same-sex couples are eligible for federal benefits. With the addition of Pennsylvania, the all the states of the Northeastern U.S. now allow same-sex marriage. Most recent court rulings allowing gay marriage have included a stay pending appeal, but Jones' ruling does not. There is, however, a three-day waiting period for all weddings in Pennsylvania. The judge noted the issue of gay marriage 'is a divisive one' that makes some people 'deeply uncomfortable.' 'However, that same sex marriage causes discomfort in some does not make its prohibition constitutional,' he wrote. 'Nor can past tradition trump the bedrock constitutional guarantees of due process and equal protection.' Doing it the legal way: Just engaged Jefferson Rougeau, left, and Steven Creps pose for photographs on the steps of the state Capitol Tuesday in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania . Joyful: Deb, left, and Susan Whitewood celebrate with a kiss at their home in South Fayette, Pa., Tuesday, May 20, 2014, after a federal judge overturned the state's ban on gay marriage . He compared Pennsylvania's ban on . same-sex marriage to school segregation laws overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court's 1954 landmark Brown vs. Board of Education decision. 'We are a better people than what these laws represent, and it is time to discard them into the ash heap of history,' he wrote. The legal challenge to Pennsylvania's Defense of Marriage Law was filed last July by several gay couples. Challengers . argued that under the ban, gay couples were denied an inheritance tax . exemption for surviving spouses and survivor benefits to partners of . police officers killed in the line of duty. 'This . is a momentous day for our clients and all same-sex couples in . Pennsylvania who want to have their love and commitment to each other . recognized in the same way as that of other couples,' said Reggie . Shuford, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union, which . was involved in the case. The state has 30 days to decide whether to appeal, the ACLU said. Plaintiffs: In this July 9, 2013 file photo, the Whitewoods, left to right, Landon, Susan,  Abbey, Katie, and Deb, pose together after a news conference to announce that Deb and Susan are the lead plaintiffs in a lawsuit to overturn a state law effectively banning same-sex marriage in Pennsylvania . The . National Organization for Marriage, which argues marriage is the union . of a man and a woman, called the ruling 'brazen and unjust' and said it . would like to see the issue decided by voters. 'The . ruling unilaterally makes an end-run around the democratic process and . places the capricious will of one man above the desires of millions of . citizens,' said Brian Brown, NOM president, in a statement. Pennsylvania . Attorney General Kathleen Kane announced after the lawsuit was filed . that she would not defend the case, prompting calls for impeachment from . conservative legislators. On . Tuesday, Kane tweeted: 'Today, in Pennsylvania, the Constitution . prevailed. Inequality in any form is unacceptable and it has never stood . the test of time.' Governor Tom Corbett appointed William Lamb, a fellow Republican and former prosecutor, to handle the case. Joe Parisi and Steven Seminelli hurried from work to get their marriage license at Philadelphia City Hall. Parisi . says they didn't want to miss their chance. The licenses could be put . on hold if Republican Gov. Tom Corbett appeals Tuesday's court decision. Corbett hasn't said if he will appeal.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . and Reuters . A federal aviation official says a commercial airliner nearly collided with an unmanned drone aircraft earlier this year in a near-catastrophic indecent that demonstrates the risks of the growing number of drones in U.S. skies. An American Airlines pilot told federal aviation officials about the March 22 incident when he says a small, remote-control aircraft came dangerously close to his plane about 2,300 feet above the ground over Tallahassee Regional Airport, said Jim Williams, manager of the Federal Aviation Administration's Unmanned Aircraft System Integration Office. 'The airplane pilot said that the UAS was so close to his jet that he was sure he had collided with it,' Williams said at an industry conference on Thursday, referring to an unmanned aircraft system. Close call: A commercial pilot says a drone came 'dangerously close' to an American Airlines flight over Florida . The aircraft, operated an American subsidiary, did not show damage when it was inspected after the March 22 incident, Williams said. But 'the risk for a small UAS to be ingested into a passenger airline engine is very real,' Williams said. 'The results could be catastrophic.' Williams says aviation officials need to understand the risks of including unmanned drones into the complex U.S. aviation system. 'It's important to . develop solutions and answers to these questions before we risk the . safety of the world's safest aviation system,' he told the conference. Catastrophic: Aviation officials say that if a drone is sucked into the engine of an airliner, the results would be catastrophic . The Wall Street Journal reports that Williams used to the famous 'Miracle on the Hudson' - when a U.S. Airways flight was forced to land in New York City's Hudson River after a flock of birds were sucked into the plane's engines - to illustrate the dangers drones pose to commercial aircraft. 'Imagine a metal-and-plastic object, . especially that big lithium battery, going into a high-speed turbine . engine,' he said. 'The results could be catastrophic.' Gretchen . West, executive vice president for drone trade group Association for . Unmanned Vehicle Systems International, echoed Williams' concerns about the lack of clear FAA rules regulating drones. 'A lot . of people already fly [drones] without rules and regulation. It's . almost a free for all,' she said Friday, noting that Williams 'is painting a . picture that this technology could threaten safety, but that goes back . to the FAA. They have to come up with the rules to create a safe . environment.' Risk: Aviation officials say the risk of a drone getting sucked into the engine of a commercial jet is 'very real' In his address, Williams also showed videos of several drone accidents, including one in which a drone crashed into a crowd during the running of the bulls in Richmond, Virginia, last fall. The incident was caused by a battery failure and there were minor injuries, he said. The FAA currently bans the commercial use of drones in the United States and has come under growing criticism for failing to set rules that would permit their broader use. Last year, the agency began establishing test sites where businesses can try out commercial uses.","The incident occurred over Tallahassee Regional Airport on March 22 .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . and Reuters . NastyGal founder Sophia Amoruso, a community college dropout who has gone on to build a $100million fashion business, has lifted the lid on her unlikely journey from thief to chief, rags to riches and anti-capitalist to CEO. ‘#Girlboss,’ Ms Amoruso's first foray into writing, has garnered attention since its release this month for the intimate details of the entrepreneur's turbulent past: from being a broke and shoplifting youngster to harnessing the power of the Internet to sell vintage clothing on eBay. Sitting in her 55,000-square-foot loft office in downtown Los Angeles, the Louis Vuitton-clad Ms Amoruso, 30, oversees hundreds of employees at NastyGal headquarters, her eBay business now a flourishing online fashion brand. Hitting it big: Sophia Amoruso, founder and CEO of NastyGal, built her online business from an eBay shop to a multi-million-dollar company . ‘But there's also the serendipity of meeting the right person at the right time, and the serendipity of just having the idea at the right time that drives you to actually ask for something rather than have it fall on your lap.’ Because Ms Amoruso started her eBay boutique turned mega brand the age of 22, she was not as concerned with the possibility of failure as many entrepreneurs typically can be. Flair for design: NastyGal is known for its trendy merchandise, which runs the gamut from haute hippie to Nineties raver . ‘But there's also the serendipity of meeting the right person at the right time, and the serendipity of just having the idea at the right time that drives you to actually ask for something rather than have it fall on your lap.’ Because Ms Amoruso started her eBay boutique turned mega brand the age of 22, she was not as concerned with the premise of failure as many entrepreneurs typically can be. On shelves: Ms Amoruso's first book, #Girlboss, was released earlier this month . Nasty Gal formally launched in 2008 after Ms Amoruso’s eBay business had become so large that a standalone site became a plausible idea. Her account on the auction site was terminated soon after amid allegations of ‘linking out’ (leaving eBay without its commission fee), and toying with bids. The site is named for a song by Betty Davis, and is known for its trendy merchandise, which runs the gamut from haute hippie to Nineties raver - all at an affordable price. But despite her entrepreneurial spirit, Ms Amoruso says that she never even intended to become a CEO. ‘Failure is, it's like those are the people who are going out in the world and saying, “This is what I want to do, and if this doesn't work, I've failed,” which I never did. I never wanted to be a CEO,' she explained. ‘I mean, I want to be one today but I never intended to be a CEO. I never intended to build a $100 million business. If that was what I was focused on, I think I would be missing all of these things along the way, all of the small things that got us here.’ As for her lack of formal education, Ms Amoruso, a Sacramento, California native, says ‘[College] just wasn't for me. I think it's amazing. I think if you know what value you can derive from college and are mature enough to do that and get what there is to get out of the college experience, it's perfect. ‘If you're unhappy like I was, and too impatient to complete four years of anything at that age, it's not for you.'","Sophia Amoruso is the 30-year-old founder and CEO of NastyGal .

"By . Ap . and Reuters . Consumer rights law firm Hagens Berman said it filed a nationwide antitrust class-action lawsuit against Google Inc alleging the company 'illegally monopolized' the Internet and mobile search market in the United States. The lawsuit alleges that Google has expanded its monopoly of the internet search market by pre-loading its applications onto Android mobile devices through its Mobile Application Distribution Agreements. According to the lawsuit, Google's role in placing this suite of apps, including Google Play and YouTube, has hampered the market and kept the price of devices made by competing manufactures like Samsung Electronics and HTC Corp artificially high. What I do? Google co-founder Sergey Brin shows off one of the multi-talented tech firm's driverless cars, but its their propensity to include products like YouTube preloaded onto Android devices that has one consumer rights law firm filing an antitrust suit . Google said Android and Google can be used independent of each other. 'Anyone can use Android without Google and anyone can use Google without Android. Since Android's introduction, greater competition in smartphones has given consumers more choices at lower prices,' Matt Kallman, a Google spokesman, told Reuters. Steve Berman, the attorney representing consumers, alleged that Google had not achieved its monopoly by offering a better search engine, but through anti-competitive placement and market manipulation. News of Berman's suit comes just days after the Supreme Court brought a decade old antitrust suit against old guard tech giant Microsoft to an end. The high court on April 28 brought an end to Novell Inc's antitrust claims against Google's progenitor that date back 20 years to the development of Windows 95 software. Old guard: News of the Google suit comes just days after Microsoft finally saw the end of its own decade-long antitrust suit when the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear the appeal April 28 . By declining to hear Novell's appeal, the court left intact a 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruling from September 2013 in favor of Microsoft. The court of appeals unanimously affirmed the dismissal of Novell Inc's claims that Microsoft violated the Sherman Antitrust Act when it decided not to share its intellectual property while developing its Windows 95 operating system. Novell was seeking more than $3 billion. Since the 1990s, Microsoft has been pursued by government prosecutors, consumers and competitors for alleged antitrust violations when it was widely considered a mighty monopolist.","The firm Hagens Berman filed suit against the company claiming their methods have hampered the market and kept phone prices inflated .

"By . Reuters . So the council for the city of 7,000 residents has agreed to seek entry to a state financial oversight program dating from 1987 that facilitates access to credit and permits the levying of certain taxes. Now, though, some lawmakers say the program is more like a trap than a benefit: municipalities get into it, and few get out. Just seven of the 27 local governments to enter state oversight under the program, known as Act 47, have ever been released from it. As a result, legislators want to cap how long cities can stay under state oversight and, in the hardest cases, impose a municipal death penalty that amounts to disincorporation and a state takeover. The law was passed in a bid to help Pennsylvania cities battered by the decline of the American steel industry in the 1970s and '80s.

A woman walks down Market Street in Shamokin . 'We want to hopefully prevent them from going in, but if they do, there needs to be an exit strategy,' said Senator Rob Teplitz, a Democrat who represents the state capital of Harrisburg, which last year sold some of its assets and restructured debt. He's one of the sponsors of a bill that would cap the amount of time a municipality can stay in the program. A handful of high-profile failings, such as Detroit's bankruptcy filing last July, has focused attention on the role states should play in helping their struggling cities. About half of U.S. states have some kind of intervention program, according to James Spiotto, a partner at the law firm Chapman and Cutler in Chicago. STATE OVERSIGHT . In Pennsylvania, 20 local governments are operating under state oversight, and six have been in the program for a quarter century or more, according to the state Department of Community and Economic Development, which administers the program. The bill now moving through the legislature would codify the state's early-intervention options and improve financial reporting to allow the state to spot and help troubled municipalities earlier.

State oversight under the amended Act 47 would be capped initially at five years, and the absolute limit, with extensions, would be eight. Imposing a hard deadline could force elected officials to make unpopular decisions such raising taxes, cutting jobs or eliminating services to balance budgets, said John H. Eichelberger, a Republican state senator from Hollidaysburg and a prime sponsor of the bill. He hopes to have legislation ready for Governor Tom Corbett by June. Under the 'death penalty,' municipalities would be disincorporated and converted into 'municipal service districts' run indefinitely by court-appointed administrators, not local elected officials. 'This would almost never happen,' Eichelberger said. 'But if something must happen, this is an option.' Opponents of the bill include Harrisburg City Councilman Brad Koplinski, who pushed for his city for file for bankruptcy in 2011. The filing was thrown out later that year after state lawmakers temporarily banned it. Koplinski said the eight-year deadline is 'onerous' given the magnitude of the problems some cities face. A woman sits on the street in a wheelchair eating a donut in Shamokin . A man walks down Market Street with darkening clouds forming above the bluff in the distance in Shamokin . But weaning these towns from assistance while their local economies still languish has proven to be too tall an order for most of them. One of those cities, Aliquippa, the Pittsburgh suburb where former Chicago Bears tight end and coach Mike Ditka grew up, entered Act 47 the same year the law was implemented. Since taking office in 2012, Aliquippa Mayor Dwan B. Walker has focused on getting the city off what he called the 'crutch' of Act 47. The city hired a software management company to improve accounting systems, for example. This year marked the first budget in ten years that Aliquippa did not have to take out a tax anticipation loan. The city typically borrowed between $250,000 and $350,000 a year, Walker said. But after decades of distress, there's no set date for the city to exit the program, which Walker called 'a stigma.' 'It took forty years to drive this bus into the ditch,' he said.","Shamokin, Pennsylvania can't get loans from banks and is seeking entry into a state financial oversight program .

"By . Freya Noble For Daily Mail Australia . The many roles that teachers are expected to fill beyond the bounds of educator seem to be increasing every year. Now there is greater pressure than ever for them to take on the role of a doctor too, as the number of children who need regular medication during school hours continues to rise. However the perils of this were proven earlier in the week when a young boy was given another student's medication by accident, the Herald Sun report. Teachers are now taking on more responsibility than ever and at many schools are administering their students' medication . A six-year-old boy called Mitchell who needed ritalin - which is used to treat attention deficit disorder - was apparently given another child's medication by accident. The child's teacher apparently figured out what had happened very quickly, but he had already swallowed the wrong tablet. Mitchell's dad Gus Reynolds told the publication he understands that accidents occur but he was not happy with the way the his son's school - Iramoo Primary School in Melbourne's west - handled the situation. This week a young boy was given the wrong medication at school when it was mixed up with another child's . 'As humans we can make mistakes, but it was the way it was handled', Mr Reynolds said. The teachers apparently did not keep an eye on the boy to check for any potential side effects. However Australian Education Union Victorian branch president Meredith Peace pointed out that the demands on teachers are increasing and the responsibility they have is much greater than a decade ago. Ms Peace also said as some children need various doses of some medications at various times throughout the day - this can be very difficult to keep track of. Some students require medication more than once a day and this places pressure on teachers . The issue is a complex one and in some cases teachers are taking on the role of doctors, when they are not necessarily trained to do so. The increase in children taking medication is said to be due to a rise in the number of kids with either allergies or behavioral issues which require medication as part of their treatment. Iramoo Primary School's principal said the mix-up occurred because one of the medication wasn't labelled properly and therefore got combined with another student's. The school is now apparently looking at a new system which could see children's pictures attached to their medication to avoid any further issues.","A young Melbourne boy was given the wrong medication this week .

"By . Associated Press . and Snejana Farberov For Mail Online . Prosecutors finished presenting their case to a jury Thursday in the corruption trial of former Virginia Governor Bob McDonnell and his wife, Maureen. FBI Special Agent David Hulser was the final witness for the government. His wide-ranging testimony helped prosecutors sum up their case against the McDonnells. Bob and Maureen McDonnell began trial in July on charges that they took more than $165,000 in gifts and loans from Jonnie Williams, the former CEO of dietary supplements maker Star Scientific Inc., in exchange for helping promote his company's products. In high spirits: Former Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell, left, arrives with his attorneys, John L. Brownlee, center, and Henry W. Asbill at the federal courthouse in Richmond, Va., Thursday . Back in court: Former Virginia first lady Maureen McDonnell, left, arrives with her attorney Heather Martin at the federal courthouse in Richmond for the corruption trial against her and her husband . They also were accused of falsifying financial documents, and Maureen McDonnell was charged with obstructing the federal investigation. Hulser told the court that Williams spent more than $36,000 entertaining the McDonnells at a Cape Cod resort in 2012. the weekend tab included more than $9,000 for food and beverages, including 16 servings of Louis XIII cognac totaling $2,400. Financial records showed that former Star Scientific CEO covered all the expenses for the McDonnells and three other guests. The ex-governor, once a rising star in the Republican Party who was widely considered a possible Mitt Romney running mate in 2012, has vigorously denied any wrongdoing and vowed to fight charges that he claimed were politically motivated. Following the money trail: FBI specialist David Hulser, right, told the court that businessman Jonnie Williams spent more than $36,000 entertaining the McDonnells at a Cape Cod resort in 2012 . He claims prosecutors improperly stretched the definition of bribery to cover long-accepted political courtesies like hosting receptions and arranging meetings for constituents with government officials. The trial so far has produced many embarrassing details of the cozy relationship with Williams that destroyed McDonnell's political future. Williams said he lavished the McDonnells with gifts including Oscar de la Renta dresses; Louis Vuitton shoes;, a $6,500 Rolex watch; golf outings; vacations and $15,000 to cover catering expenses for a daughter's wedding. Bottoms up: Williams spent more than $9,000 for food and beverages, including nearly $2,500 worth of Louis XIII cognac . He also made three loans totaling $120,000 as the McDonnells struggled with debts related to two family-owned vacation rental properties in Virginia Beach. All the while, Williams was seeking help from Virginia government officials. The McDonnells attended conferences to promote Star Scientific products and hosted an event for the company at the Executive Mansion, prosecutors showed, and the governor's office arranged a meeting between Williams and the state's top health official to discuss the health benefits of the products. The trial has been especially embarrassing for Maureen McDonnell, who was portrayed in an unfavorable light by several former aides. A onetime chief of staff to Virginia's former first lady testified that she told investigators Maureen McDonnell was 'a nutbag.' McDonnell's former political adviser, Phil Cox, testified that in 2012, Williams and Maureen McDonnell tried unsuccessfully to get a meeting with GOP presidential candidate Romney to pitch Star Scientific's signature product, the anti-inflammatory Anatabloc. Having failed to get an audience with the candidate, Maureen McDonnell cornered his wife, Ann Romney, on a campaign bus and began telling her how Anatabloc could cure her multiple sclerosis, Cox testified. 'I was horrified,' Cox said. 'I didn't think it sort of showed the governor in a great light.' The defense is set to begin presenting its case Monday, and Bob McDonnell is expected to testify at some point during the trial. Bob and Maureen McDonnell are accused of taking more than $165,000 in gifts and loans from the former CEO of dietary supplements maker Star Scientific Inc . Defense witness: McDonnell, pictured in court Monday, is expected to take the stand at some point during the trial, which will continue next week . In court papers, his attorneys argued that everything he did was consistent with a governor's mission of supporting state-based businesses and that Williams did not receive any state grants or other tangible benefits.Lawyers for the McDonnells have contended that the couple could not have been conspiring with Williams, because their marriage was crumbling and they were not on speaking terms. During the trial, the McDonnells have come to court separately and have avoided looking at each other in court. An attorney for the first lady says she had a 'crush' on Williams. But prosecutors have produced photos showing the Republican governor and his wife embracing and smiling. Former staff members have said they appeared to be a loving couple. Maureen McDonnell is not expected to take the stand. If the McDonnells are convicted, they could each face prison sentences of 20 years and heavy fines.","FBI agent David Hulser testified that businessman Jonnie Williams spent $36,000 on Bob and Maureen McDonnell's trip to Cape Cod, including $2,400 for cognac .

In May he pleaded guilty to two charges of importing the Class C drugs, which is said to have been about 700 grams of methylone. According to court files seen by The Press, the 24-year-old was arrested after he admitted to receiving a number of packages which had been intercepted at Auckland Airport. Custom officials then carried out what is known as a 'controlled delivery', where one of the packages is monitored while it's sent to the intended address. This took place on November 28. The 24-year-old won the title of world champion at the National Amateur Bodybuilders Association in Italy in June 2013 . Orton admitted he was the intended recipient and told police he had been instructed to leave the packages on the porch of his house, and would be paid $500 for each delivery. The bodybuilder, who works at NZ fitness chain Les Mills, also told officers he thought the packages may contain an ingredient to make drugs but he did not know for sure. The 709 grams which customs seized was estimated to have a street value of nearly $95,000 once it had been cut with other substances. On Thursday he was set to appear on court for sentencing over the two charges, which he pleaded guilty to in May . Orton is active on social media and often posts photos and videos of his training sessions . Orton has a strong social media presence and often posts photos and videos of his workouts to his Facebook page and YouTube channel. He calls himself 'The Ox' and asks people to 'Follow me on my quest to reach my dream of a Professional Bodybuilding status.' The New Zealander has apparently been making waves in the bodybuilding industry, and has been pinned as a possible future Mr Olympia, the competition made famous by actor Arnold Schwarzenegger.

"By . Freya Noble For Daily Mail Australia . and Daniel Piotrowski For Daily Mail Australia . and Aap . The adult daughter of baby Gammy's father David has broken her silence, admitting she was responsible for whispers that the Farnells believed baby Gammy was dead. In an interview published by local newspaper The Bunbury Mail, Jane Farnell said she had told friends the baby, who has Down Syndrome, had died because it was simpler than 'dragging them into all the confusion'. 'My parents never said Gammy had died, that came from me,' the newspaper quoted Ms Farnell saying. Scroll down for video . Jane Farnell (left) with David Farnell (centre) and Wendy Farnell (right). The Farnell family: Featuring Jane (far right), David (far left) and Wendy (right of David). Pattaramon Janbua, pictured here with surrogate child Gammy, has claimed she was asked to abort him and his twin sister Pipah seven months in to her pregnancy . 'The only reason I told my friends that he had died was that it was easier than dragging them all into the confusion.' 'I thought it would be easier to say he had passed away and then have to explain it later on if he came home.' Ms Farnell added that baby Gammy's twin sister, Pipah, was a happy little girl who only cried during teething. She said that Mr Farnell, a convicted child sex offender had done a 'terrible thing' in the past, but she believed in the integrity of the child protection system. Overnight Pattharamon Janbua claimed on Thai Rath News that David and Wendy Farnell asked her to abort both children when she was seven months pregnant. Ms Janbua also said the agents and doctors caring for were aware that Gammy had Down Syndrome early into her pregnancy. Furthermore, she said she used someone else's name and ID to register for surrogacy as she was only 19 when she made the agreement with an agency. 'It was the agent ... she said that they (the Farnells) wanted to abort both of the children'. Ms Janbua told the program, adding she broke down in tears when she received this news. 'She said that the parents had been very shocked and frightened... they were insisting on the abortion. I said I couldn't do that... cause I was seven months into the pregnancy already.' Ms Janbua said she was then given the option to abort just one of the children - the one with a disability - though she still refused this as she believed she was too far into the pregnancy. 'They told me that the child would have to be injected with some drugs (or poison) to take his life and then be taken out by surgical process. Then the girl would go into the incubator right away ... these words have since then stayed in my head', Ms Janbua revealed. In an interview with a Thai news program, she said David and Wendy Farnell knew months before she did that Gammy had Down Sydnrome . Also in her interview in Thailand, Ms Janbua said she believed doctors, agents and the Farnells knew about Gammy's Down Syndrome as early as four months into her pregnancy, but they did not notify her until she started having complications around seven months. She said she was sent test results to her home throughout her pregnancy, telling her that her babies were healthy and neither had any disability, mental or otherwise. 'The agency, the doctors as well as the parents knew (about Gammy's Down Syndrome) already since the fourth month of the pregnancy', Ms Janbua claimed. 'I was getting sick and had to go and stay in the hospital ... around the seventh month of the pregnancy. That's when they told me. But before that they have never mentioned anything about it to me.' In their first interview since the scandal broke, the Farnells said on Sunday night they would have asked the surrogate mother to terminate the pregnancy if they had known earlier on about Gammy's disability. However they claimed they knew nothing about his condition until around the seven month mark. Ms Janbua also said doctors and her surrogacy agents were aware of a condition she carried which may result in any baby being born with a disability, but they did not notify her . In Australia, laws on the terminations of pregnancies vary state to state, but in Western Australia - where the Farnells are from - the four month mark would still be considered a safe time to abort the children as it is legal to have an abortion during the first 20 weeks of pregnancy. Ms Janbua, who already has two children of her own, also said she believed she was misled by the agents and doctors in charge of her, as they withheld information about a health condition she had. When she underwent blood tests prior to carrying the embryo, they showed Ms Janbua had thalassemia, a common blood disorder that can cause stillbirth, a range of growth and learning disorders and heart failure. 'Nobody told me anything ...I asked the agency that if I had this disease ... would that mean that I should not get into pregnancy? They said that it was okay. The doctor said it was alright', she told the program. 'I didn't know that if you have thalassemia there will be great chances that your child will suffer from down-syndrome. If the doctor had told me ... probably I would not have gone through with the procedure.' The Farnells, pictured here with Gammy's twin sister Pipah, have been at the centre of the surrogacy scandal after Ms Janbua claimed they left Gammy in Thailand because of his disability . Another twist raised by Ms Janbua was that she originally registered for surrogacy using the identity of her partner's brother's girlfriend, as she was three months shy of 20 years old at the time. 'The agency told that is was okay... that I could use somebody else's ID instead. I didn't know what they were using my name for... they just told me that they will need give this name to the clinic ... to register myself', she said. Ms Janbua claimed she did this as she had little knowledge about the surrogacy process, and only changed her name on the forms after she had to sign documents at the embassy.","Adult daughter of David and Wendy Farnell speaks publicly for the first time .

The six-piece collection will launch on Net-A-Porter August 25 - priced between $600 and $1,625 - and includes over the knee suede boots, statement jewel sandals, metallic leather sandals, laced-up gladiator sandals, suede pumps and booties. 'I think it is no secret that I love a good shoe,' said the 28-year-old global style icon. 'So I very much enjoyed creating a ""survival pack"" for every occasion and women of all ages.' Word: 'I think it is no secret that I love a good shoe,' said the 28-year-old global style icon (pictured). 'So I very much enjoyed creating a ""survival pack"" for every occasion and women of all ages' Ms Palermo, who tied the knot with dishy model Johannes Huebl, also 28, on June 29, has long been a fan of the Florence-based label's elaborate footwear; described by its co-founder and creative director Edgardo Osorio in the past as being an 'unofficial ambassador' for the brand. 'Olivia and I have a very similar vision of shoes,' Mr Osorio states. 'She is a real style icon and has amazing knowledge about shoes and accessories. 'We wanted to create a capsule collection of the styles every woman needs in her closet, interpreted with the Aquazzura aesthetic and seen through the eyes of Olivia.' Devotee: Ms Palmero (pictured wearing one of her designs) has long been a fan of the Florence-based label's footwear, and was once described by its co-founder Edgardo Osorio as being an 'unofficial ambassador' All that glitters: These jewel-encrusted stilettos, available in black (left) and pale pink (right) were inspired by a vintage Victorian necklace belonging to Ms Palermo . Lace-up gladiators: The collection has been summarized as having an 'Aquazzura aesthetic' but 'seen through the eyes' of Ms Palmero . The collection of very high heels, modeled by the former reality star herself, includes a pair of jewel-encrusted stilettos inspired by a vintage Victorian necklace she owns. Saks Fifth Avenue will stock the fall collection from September, as will Lane Crawford, Tsum and Holt Renfrew; while Net-A-Porter will be the only online retailer to sell them. 'I very much enjoyed creating a ‘survival pack’ for every occasion' It's not the newlywed socialite's first foray into the arena of designer collaborations.

Sky-high: 'We wanted to create a capsule collection of the styles every woman needs in her closet,' claims Aquazzura . Coming soon: Saks Fifth Avenue will stock the fall collection from September, as will Lane Crawford, Tsum and Holt Renfrew; while Net-A-Porter will be the only online retailer to sell them, starting August 25 . Last month, she designed a capsule collection of sunglasses for Westward Leaning, retailing for $210 a pair. 'No other person... has the kind of conversion power that Olivia has,' Westward Leaning's co-founder Robert Denning said in June. 'When Justin Bieber and Selena Gomez broke up, he left wearing the pair of sunglasses we’d gifted Selena. 'I thought it would lead to a huge spike in sales, but didn’t move the dial at all.' If her apparent Midas touch with Westward Leaning's wares is anything to go by, Ms Palmero's Aquazzura collaboration is likely to be a storming success.","The Aquazzura x Olivia Palermo collection will launch on Net-A-Porter August 25, priced between $600 and $1,625 ."

"By . Freya Noble For Daily Mail Australia . Brad Dillon, 26, was gunned down on a busy Leichhardt street on Monday evening . The man who was tragically shot and killed in an inner-west suburb of Sydney on Monday night has been identified as a 26-year-old husband with two young children. Brad Dillon was gunned down in a very public execution just before 6pm, a murder which was witnessed by many locals in Leichhardt. He was shot in the chest five times outside local shopping centre MarketPlace, and Nine News reported that two people at the scene attempted to give the man CPR - but he could not be saved. Residents on Lords Road told Daily Mail Australia they heard the gunshots from inside their houses, with one woman saying she had been at the shops just minutes before the shooting took place. Mr Dillon is survived by his wife and two young kids, and a friend - who did not wish to be named - told Daily Mail Australia there was no other way to describe him but as an all round good guy. 'He was a great bloke, a really great bloke', they said. 'And in more recent times he really became a family guy.' The father of two was shot five times in the chest in a grisly execution . Mr Dillon was an exceptional football player who was part of the Balmain Tigers junior representative team when he was younger . The father of two was an excellent football player, and played at a very high level for his local footy team the North Ryde Hawks for many years.

"By . Freya Noble For Daily Mail Australia . An Australian man has been charged after he took off with an ice cream truck from the Central Coast of New South Wales on Monday morning. The 45-year-old allegedly stole the Peters Ice Cream vehicle near Newcastle train station just before 9am, and made off with the treat-filled truck. About half an hour later police discovered the van making its way south down the Pacific Highway where a police pursuit was initiated with police cars hot on the sweet thief's tail.

"By . Freya Noble For Daily Mail Australia . A boy who grew up on the land in country Victoria and went on to serve in Australia's Defence Forces for nearly four decades, John Oddie recalled the moment that would the set the course for the rest of his life. He remembers watching the planes flying high and low across his parent's farm but admitted 'I never imagined I could be a pilot or even that it was within reach.' Then one day, 'I was out in the paddocks just on the tractor and this F-111 (aircraft) nearly took my wheel stack off. And I thought you know, that's really exciting', Mr Oddie told Daily Mail Australia. Retired Air Commodore John Oddie has penned a novel detailing his experiences after nearly four decades in the Australian Defence Forces . 'That person has made a decision and I have not, I'm sitting here annoyed with my life and that person has clearly made a decision to do something about theirs', he said speaking of the plane's pilot. From there, with the mentality that 'normal human beings do this, I'm a normal being, I can do it' a young Mr Oddie - barely into his 20s - put in an application to join the Defence Force, an application which he says 'changed his life'. In his new book Flight Command, retired Air Commodore Mr Oddie puts on paper his 35 year career in the military and then the Royal Australian Airforce, but also tells of the emotional impact war has on not just individuals, but their families too. 'The key point here is the families, when we go off we know what we're doing, (but) they've got no idea because we either don't have the time to tell them, or can't tell them, or we just don't think to tell them', Mr Oddie revealed. Mr Oddie, pictured in sunglasses, commanded the first Australian response team to the Boxing Day Tsunami in Banda Aceh, the worst affected city on the northwest coast of Indonesia . In the book, Flight Command, Mr Oddie recalls the horrific devastation that swept the country after the natural disaster . 'I'm hoping this is the story of the feelings that arise when you do interesting things in remarkable places... And certainly my goal is to enrich the dialogue in society about defence and military people.' Mr Oddie said he hopes his book will bring greater understanding about the Australian military and defence forces . From the tough call Mr Oddie made one night when he decided to go to the Gulf War, to the complete and utter devastation which came in the wake of the Boxing Day tsunami in Indonesia, Flight Command is an exploration of the full experience of serving on the front line. He was in command of the first Australian team to touch down and offer aid after the natural disaster, and said there was no other way to describe the tsunami other than totally and utterly destructive. 'We saw rivers of corpses, bloated blackened corpses, all mixed into the detritus, with new cars and old, building materials and humans. Children, men, women, everything all mixed up', Mr Oddie recalled. 'We saw, and smelt the ugliness and the consequence of this dragon coming out of the sea and destroying everything in front of it. 'And I truly use the word dragon because when you look at it, you think there's only one thing that could have done that and that's a dragon that came out of the water and just ate the land,' he said. Scenes like this can be overwhelming and just as destructive for those who are there providing relief, and the retired Air Commodore told of the heartbreaking moment one of his fellow servicemen was unable to cope when confronted with such a horrific situation. From never even daring to dream he could be a pilot to serving in two wars, Mr Oddie says applying for the military at age 20 changed his life . The novel also reveals the heartbreak of losing mates in battle, and the emotional toll war takes on all those who come into contact with it . 'When we went to the tsunami one of my colleagues was in a moment of intense personal stress and ended up taking his own life, and we found out while we were in the middle of it. 'We had such high regard for our colleague and we were so hurt by the fact that he made this choice and we weren't given the chance to help him through it.' This emotional toll is one that anyone who serves in the Defence Forces has no choice but to live with - and one that Mr Oddie said can be an enormous burden, and many of the psychological injuries sustained in battle can last a lifetime. 'In every moment, you leave the moment damaged in some way. And then of that, let's say you walk away with a lump of damage of 100 percent, 80 percent of that will get fixed over time and goes away. Mr Oddie, pictured second from left, tells of the impact that being forced into an early retirement had on his life . Mr Oddie served in the Gulf War, in the conflict in the middle east during a career which spanned 35 years . 'But there'll be a little bit that's left, that last 20 percent which is left and sort of stays in the background. You can't ever put that back in the bank, it's damage which goes on forever.' Over time however, Mr Oddie learned to deal with the burden of this, despite the many pressures it put on his family. And through the horror of war and disaster Mr Oddie said human joy in it's most raw and deep form is always there. 'In the middle of the most dire disaster is always the most beautiful human experiences. Always you will see the absolute best and absolute worst in those dire moments. 'They're not shallow moments of joy, they're truly deep and meaningful moment', he revealed. Through having his portrait painted multiple times by Australian artist Ben Quilty, and being confronted by his own emotions evident in the artwork, Mr Oddie decided to tell his story . Mr Oddie, right, said through even the most horrific disasters are always the most beautiful human experiences . Through having his portrait painted multiple times by Australian artist Ben Quilty, and being confronted by his own emotions evident in the artwork, Mr Oddie decided to tell his story. He did so with the aim to help Australians gain a greater understanding of their military, and to ask people to remember the immense hardship the families of servicemen and women face. Flight Command details Mr Oddie's struggle to adjust after he returned from conflict in the middle east to an earlier than expected retirement, and what it was like to come back to a world that so vastly differed from the war torn one he'd just returned from.

According to Thai surrogacy laws, baby Gammy's biological parents have no claim to their son, and Gammy's surrogate mother can not be forced to give up custody. This comes after the couple claimed, 'we want to get our son back' during an interview with 60 Minutes, despite allegations they abandoned their son after they learned he had Down's syndrome. However, Thai civil law states that the birth mother, 21-year-old Pattharamon Janbua, is Gammy's legal mother and that Gammy and his twin sister Pipah were both born Thai citizens. A person becoming a parent through Thai surrogacy cannot get custody of the child until the birth mother relinquishes her parental rights to child by allowing the child to be adopted. Accordingly, the Farnells have no legal parental rights and no automatic claim over either child. Scroll down for video . Thai surrogate mother Pattaramon Chanbua, 21, is the legal mother of baby Gammy according to Thai surrogacy laws, meaning his Australian biological parents have no parental rights over Gammy, nor over Gammy's twin sister, Pipah. The couple insisted that they will return to Thailand to bring Gammy to Australia, explaining 'we miss our little boy.' The story of baby Gammy has caused a media storm and public outrage, after it was revealed that the seven-month-old baby was rejected by his Australian parents after they discovered that he is handicapped. The couple, the Farnells, took Gammy's twin sister, Pipah back to their home in Western Australia and have spoken publicly for the first time. In the interview on Sunday night, Mr Farnell claimed that Ms Janbua threatened to contact the authorities and keep both children, which gave the Farnells no choice but to flee with their baby girl. '(Ms Janbua) said that if we tried to take our little boy, she's going to get the police and she's going to try and take our little girl and she's going to keep both of the babies,"" he said. Wendy (left) and David (right) Farnell, the couple who turned to a Thai surrogate to try and conceive, are pictured with their daughter, Pipah. Under Thai law, they have no claim to Pipah, nor to her twin brother Gammy, unless the birth mother chooses to give the child up for adoption. Ms Janbua agreed that she exercised her rights under Thai law to refuse giving Gammy to the Australian couple. 'I did not allow Gammy to go back with them, that's the truth,' Ms Janbua told The Associated Press on Sunday, which conflicts with her earlier accusation that the couple had abandoned the baby boy. 'It is because they would have taken Gammy back and put him in an institute.' The Farnells only chance of taking custody of Gammy is if Ms Janbua agrees to give up the baby for adoption. Comments from the babies' surrogate mother, Ms Janbua, indicate she will not give up the child that she is raising as her own son. Baby Gammy being cared for in hospital by his surrogate mother, who it has been revealed is Gammy's legal mother, according to Thai surrogacy laws . Responding to the interview, Ms Janbua said the Farnells were 'dreaming' if they thought they could now take Gammy back to Australia, stuff.co.nz reported. 'I will take care of my baby until I die ... no-one will take my baby away from me,' Ms Chanbua said. 'I want them to come to Thailand. I will take Gammy to see them. But they will never get my boy. 'You are dreaming. You are already guilty of abandoning Gammy and now you think you can get away with this.' Ms Farnell told 60 minutes, 'we always wanted our son... We miss him everyday.' David Farnell denies reports that they abandoned Gammy. 'We never abandoned him. ‘We never said to the surrogate mother to have an abortion. There is always hope. At the very beginning, when we found out he had Down’s syndrome we said we still wanted him,' said Mr Farnell. Pattaramon Chanbua (left), Gammy's birth mother, pictured with her husband (right) and the baby boy that is at the heart of the scandal that has outraged Australia. David Farnell is a convicted paedophile with 22 convictions for child sex offences, including one against a girl aged seven. The 57-year-old sobbed in the interview when asked if they were concerned that the daughter in their care, Gammy's twin Pipah, would be taken away from them. 'I hope she won't be,' he replied through tears. The Farnells have admitted that they have not contacted Ms Chanbua to enquire about Gammy's wellbeing since they left Thailand, nor have they contacted authorities for help. Between 100 and 200 Australians are currently involved in Thai surrogacy and are being affected by the announcement that commerical surrogacies are being banned in Thailand. A picture of Gammy, posted by his birth mother, Pattaramon Chanbua, who has sworn to care for the child 'until the day she dies.' This is both affecting parents that cannot leave Thailands with newborns and those that are awaiting the birth of their biological children, through Thai surrogates. Australia has pressed the Thai government to allow a transition period before it bans commercial surrogacy in a bid to allow Australians to receive children being carried by Thai surrogate mothers. The request made by Foreign Minister Julie Bishop comes a day after a Thai surrogacy agency was shut down by authorities. As many as 50 Australian couples may have lost the opportunity to be parents after the Bangkok IVF clinic was shut down with Thai authorities suspecting links to an international baby trafficking organisation. Following the closure of the All IVF Center on Friday, there are grave concerns that Thai surrogate mothers could abort their babies now they have no support from the clinic as the baby Gammy scandal has seen 40 clinics raided in a serious crackdown across Thailand.

"By . Freya Noble For Daily Mail Australia . and Daniel Mills For Daily Mail Australia . In a revealing interview which aired on 60 Minutes on Australia's Nine Network on Sunday night, the biological father of baby Gammy has revealed he would have terminated the embryo had he discovered the child's Down syndrome sooner, saying: 'No parent wants a son with a disability'. David Farnell also told of how his wife Wendy sometimes dresses their daughter Pipah, Gammy's twin, in blue 'remember the little boy', and said his previous urges which saw him convicted for child sex offences have '100 percent stopped'. The West Australian couple David and Wendy Farnell reportedly abandoned Gammy in Thailand when they discovered his disability and left him with his surrogate mother, 21-year-old Pattaramon Chanbua. Speaking of the news that baby Gammy had Down Syndrome, Mr Farnell admitted: 'If it would have been safe for the embryo to have been terminated, we probably would have terminated it.' Scroll down for video . David Farnell admitted if it 'would have been safe' they would have terminated the embryo if they knew about Gammy's disability earlier on in the pregnancy . The couple revealed that Wendy Farnell sometimes dresses Gammy's twin sister Pipah in blue to 'remember the little boy' 'It was late into the pregnancy that we learned the boy had Downs,' said Mr Farnell, through his tears. 'They sent us the reports but they didn’t do the checks early enough.' If it would have been safe for the embryo to be terminated he and his wife would have terminated it, he admitted because he did not think any parents wanted a son with a disability. 'Parents want their children to be healthy. Did you abandon him?' the couple were asked. 'No, we never abandoned him. We never said to the surrogate mother to have an abortion. There is always hope.' Mr Farnell denied media reports that he and his wife asked surrogate Ms Pattaramon to abort the boy and said they wanted to take Gammy with them. 'It's been very stressing. We miss our little boy. I come home from work some days and Wendy has dressed our little girl (Gammy's twin sister Pipah) all in blue because she wants to remember the little boy.' 'We said we want both babies to be born and we will think about this,' he said. The Farnells also vowed to return to Thailand for Gammy once they know their daughter is 'safe'. 'When we know she is 100 per cent safe with us, then we can go and get our boy back,' Mr Farnell said. The couple spoke of their heartbreak at leaving Gammy behind in Thailand, despite admitting they had not sought help from authorities . An emotional David Farnell said he and wife Wendy had no choice but to leave baby Gammy back in Thailand . The Farnells admitted they have not made contact with Gammy's surrogate mother to check on the well-being of their son since they left Thailand . Mr Farnell also denied Ms Chanbua's claims that they neglected Gammy and gave favourable treatment to Pipah. 'We bought milk for both babies, we bought nappies for both babies,' Mr Farnell said. In the interview Mr Farnell also aired detail of his dark past which saw him convicted on a number of child sex offences with girls as young as five. When asked what right he had to a young child as a convicted paedophile, Mr Farnell said he was completely rehabilitated by the prison counselling programs and no longer felt any urges. 'They have 100 percent stopped. I don't have the urge to do anything anymore', he said. 'Seeing my children and thinking if somebody did that to my children I would be devastated.' His wife Wendy supported him, and said she believes their daughter will be completely safe with him. The Farnells admitted they have not made contact with Gammy's surrogate mother to check on the well-being of their son since they left Thailand, nor reached out to authorities for help. Both have come under intense media scrutiny since the scandal broke, and were been hiding inside their Western Australia home all week while reporters camped on their door step. David and Wendy Farnell did not shower or turn on the computer to ensure no one found out that they were hidden inside. Mr Farnell also spoke of his past as a convicted child sex offender and said his sexual urges had '100 percent stopped' and his daughter would be safe . Thai surrogate mother Pattaramon Chanbua, 21, says the Farnells did not want Gammy and told her to have an abortion, when they discovered he had Down syndrome . The couple have been sought by the Western Australian Department of Child Protection, who wish to assess the Farnells suitability as parents since it was revealed that David Farnell, 56, is a convicted paedophile. The Farnells also refused to come to the door when the RSPCA took the family dog away, believing the couple had left their home and abandoned their pet. The couple say they fed their dog everyday before it was taken away on Tuesday. It is understood the Farnells have contacted the department this week. The Australian parents of baby Gammy left their home at midnight on Wednesday. On Thursday night, they filmed the interview with 60 Minutes, pleading with Australians to 'hear their side of the story before passing judgment on them'. 60 Minutes will make a donation to the charity Hands Across The Water, but the couple were not paid for the interview. The couple spoke to 60 Minutes in a revealing interview on Sunday evening, as they told 'their side of the story' Critics of the couple are angry that they left Gammy behind with his surrogate mother because he had Down's syndrome . Hands Across The Water have already raised more than $240,000 for Gammy's treatment and care. They will support Gammy until he has completed his education. The donations will also help fund a new home for his surrogate mother and her family, The Daily Telegraph report, after concerns were raised about his current living conditions, which have seen him living in a tiny single-room apartment. Founder of Hands Across The Water Peter Gaines said the charity are responding to Gammy's immediate needs by finding his family a new place to live. In the late 1990s, Farnell was convicted of 22 child sex offences, committed while he was in his 20s, including one against a girl who was just seven. The sentencing judge said the victims had been 'robbed of their childhood'. Farnell was sentenced to three years jail in 1997 for sexually molesting two girls in 'secretive meetings' in his shed or house, in 1982 and 1983, when the girls were aged seven and 10. It was not until the women were adults that they made complaints and court documents said the women had suffered 'depression' and 'difficulty forming relationships' as a result of the abuse. Meanwhile Gammy's surrogate mother, Pattaramon Chanbua, declined to give an interview with the program, the Sydney Morning Herald reports. 'I don't want money from them,' she said. 'I don't need their help.' David Farnell, 56, was convicted of 22 counts of child sex offences in the late 1990s . Chanbua smothered him with kisses while he was in hospital getting treatment for a lung infection . The couple's interview came just days after one of Mr Farnell's adult children – a son from his previous marriage – spoke out in defence of his father, saying that the family had not been able to tell their side of the story for legal reasons. 'He's taken 10 years to get his life back on track and he did and he has done so well and this, this has been shattering,' the unnamed son told the Sydney Morning Herald. Ms Pattaramon claims the Farnells, from Bunbury in Western Australia, did not want seven-month-old baby Gammy when they found out he had Down syndrome and took only his twin sister. The Farnells initially claimed their daughter, whom they admitted was the same age as Gammy and had been born through a Thai surrogate, did not have a twin brother. They later said they had known about the twin, but were told he only had a day to live and should say their goodbyes to the baby before they left the country, due to civil unrest. The couple wanted to make it known that they have been cooperating with the Department of Child Protection since Wednesday morning and will continue to cooperate with them. They also said that they had been feeding their dog every day until the RSPCA took her away on Wednesday morning. Officers from the Department of Child Protection were seen visiting the Farnells' South Bunbury home on Wednesday.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Read into it what you will, but the surprise fashion hit of the summer is pyjamas – worn in the street. Sales are soaring thanks to the celebrity-led trend which adopts sleepwear as the latest way to look chic in the heat... and could possibly be the most relaxed approach to style yet. The trend was first seen on the catwalk shows of Stella McCartney and Chanel, while celebrity fans include Rihanna, Rita Ora, Millie Mackintosh, Kate Moss, Fearne Cotton, Russell Brand and Colin Farrell. Pyjama game: Cara Delevingne and Cameron Diaz have both taken to major events in sleepwear . Debenhams has reported a 34 per cent rise in sleepwear sales compared to last summer and says its personal shoppers have been 'inundated' with requests on the best way to adopt the look. A spokesman said pyjamas, now commonly referred to as 'loungewear' have made the transition into daywear. Comfy: Rihanna slips out in trainers and what could be a nightie for a night out in Santa Monica . 'The summer of 2014 will be remembered as the year of 'Sleepwear and the City',' she said. 'Shoppers are particularly keen on lightweight fabrics which have made the trend a comfortable way to cope with the recent heatwave.' She added: 'Our designer sleepwear has seen the biggest sales increase with colourful floral prints proving most popular - as nightwear becomes more trend lead, many shoppers see it as a shame to resign it solely to the bedroom. 'We are already expecting the trend to continue way into the Christmas party season and have a number of styles that we predict to be popular.' Alain Mehada, head personal stylist at the flagship Debenhams store on Oxfrod Street in central London said the best way to pull off the sleepwear trend in style is to mix bottoms with a tailored jacket to add definition to your silhouette. One should also stick to silky or cotton fabrics and steer clear of flannel, while opting for printed styles and avoiding sheer fabrics or lace. Pyjamas were first introduced in England as lounging attire in the 17th Century, but soon went out of fashion. However, in 1870 pyjamas reappeared in the Western world as sleeping attire for men, after returning British colonials brought them back and adapted the pjjama pant to come without pockets. Pyjama pockets came back into fashion in the 2000s, due to their usefulness in carrying personal items such as mobile phones. In recent years pyjamas or 'lounge wear' have been more commonly worn as daywear mainly due to the popularity of the onesie.","Debenhams has reported 34% rise in sleepwear sales compared to 2013 .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Denial: Elsa Van Der Welt is also accused of revealing patients details . A nurse bragged about her sexual escapades with another member of staff in front of patients, a tribunal heard yesterday. Elsa Van Der Walt regularly boasted about her sex life and discussed colleagues’ personal lives while on duty at Addenbrooke’s Hospital, Cambridgeshire, it was said. She also breached patient confidentiality by sharing information about eating-disorder sufferers, the Nursing and Midwifery Council was told. Giving evidence, former colleague Zoe Brown said she felt uncomfortable with Van Der Walt’s behaviour at work. When Miss Brown began a relationship with an electrician working on the hospital site in 2010, Van der Walt talked about it in front of patients, the tribunal heard. ‘I was a care worker at Addenbrooke’s,’ Miss Brown said. ‘I had formerly been a patient myself at the hospital suffering from an eating disorder. ‘My relationship with Elsa very frosty and fractious … She would compare me to service users [patients] on the ward and say that I was “one of them” rather than a staff member. ‘She made it very clear she didn’t think I should work there because of my history as an eating-disorder sufferer.’ Miss Brown said her relationship with the electrician was common knowledge on the ward, but that they wanted to be discreet. ‘We didn’t ignore each other at work but we didn’t go out of our way to have contact,’ she said. ‘Elsa used to make lots of comments if me and my partner were near each other in front of the service users. ‘She made inappropriate comments about things which were untrue – for example, she would say that me and my partner had had sex with each other on the ward … Often I was just embarrassed and said I didn’t want to speak about it. ‘It’s something I would never feel comfortable talking about in front of patients. The service users were shocked and embarrassed and they would agree with me that it was not appropriate, and ask whether I was OK.’ Van der Walt did not hold back from discussing her own sex life in front of the patients and talked about her antics with a junior doctor. Miss Brown told the hearing: ‘There were times when conversations occurred about a junior doctor on the ward – this was something that also made service users uncomfortable. ‘As people suffering from eating disorders, sex and relationships may be something that the service users feel hard to discuss. ‘It was discussed that Elsa had been swimming and that this junior doctor had taken a liking to her. Elsa then described spending a night with him.’ It was heard she regularly boasted about her sex life  while on duty at Addenbrooke’s Hospital, Cambridgeshire . Miss Brown also accused Van der Walt of having ‘favourites’ on the ward, something which had a negative effect on her relationship with other patients. Van der Walt would bring her ‘favourites’ gifts back from holidays, the panel heard. The nurse also discussed issues such as patients’ weight, eating habits, and a particular service user’s history of stealing, with other patients. Van der Walt admits one charge of attending work under the influence of alcohol on October 18, 2012. But she denies a charge of failing to maintain professional boundaries by discussing sex and her own sex life in front of patients. A further charge of breaching confidentiality by discussing patients’ private matters such as weight and other sensitive information is denied by the nurse. If her fitness to practise is found to be impaired she could be struck off. The hearing continues.","Elsa Van Der Walt boasted about sex life with electrician she met at hospital .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A simple injection could reverse heart failure by improving the beating of the damaged organ, saving thousands of lives a year. British scientists have developed a gene therapy which involves injecting a protein into the heart muscle. This boosts its ability to pump blood without an artificial pump. Lee Adams, pictured, is one of 24 patients currently relying on a mechanical heart pump to survive. He is taking part in a new trial at Harefield Hospital, London, where a protein is injected into the heart to help it pump blood . Heart failure happens when the organ is . unable to pump blood adequately. It affects more than 750,000 people in . Britain, most of them elderly, and claims 140,000 lives a year. In the Imperial College London study, a harmless engineered virus was used to carry the genes into heart muscle cells to increase the level of a protein called SERCA2a. It is hoped the revolutionary treatment will lead to patients with advanced heart failure being able to ditch the cumbersome pumps currently keeping them alive while they wait for a suitable donor heart. If the new treatment is successful, it could even mean that heart transplants become unnecessary. Lee Adams, 37, is one of 24 patients with mechanical pumps taking part in a trial of the treatment at Harefield Hospital. Sixteen have been given the gene treatment and eight a placebo. He is on the waiting list for a transplant and for more than two years has been living with an LVAD (Left Ventricular Assist Device). If successful, the new treatment could even mean that heart transplants become unnecessary . This is an . electrically driven pump which moves the blood from the left ventricle . into the main artery so it can circulate through to the rest of the . body. The LVAD is always connected to an external power supply through a lead into his abdomen. Mr Adams, from Hertfordshire, said: ‘The best thing that could happen would be for my heart function to show signs of improvement and for the gene therapy to prove to be a “miracle cure” for myself and other patients.’ Dr Alex Lyon said: ‘The whole procedure takes about ten minutes and is very simple. ‘Heart failure is an ongoing epidemic for an ageing population and we hope this will eventually benefit tens of thousands of people.’","Simple injection could reverse heart failure and save thousands of lives .

The reforms are being brought forward by Home Office minister Norman Baker in the party’s pre-manifesto which will be published next month. Their aim is to tighten up the laws on stop and search in an effort to transform community relations and increase the public’s trust in the police. Scroll down for video . Stop and search: The aim of the reforms is to tighten up the laws on stop and search in an effort to transform community relations and increase the public's trust in the police (file picture) Last November, research by the Equality and Human Rights Commission found black people were six times more likely to be stopped and searched than white people. In some areas this was as high as 29 times more likely, according to the study. Under the proposals, wearing body cameras would be compulsory for officers with firearms, members of territorial support groups and in Section 60 stop and search areas. The practice can take place without suspicion in places authorised by a senior police officer with a reasonable belief that violence has or is about to occur and where it is expedient to prevent it or search people for a weapon if one was involved in the incident. The Liberal Democrats’ policy also includes plans to eradicate the target-driven incentives which can cause the powers to be overused by police and improve safeguards through tighter guidance. Changes: The reforms are being brought forward by Home Office minister Norman Baker (pictured) in the Liberal Democrat party's pre-manifesto which will be published next month . In addition, it will ensure permission for area-based stop and search is subject to judicial approval. Mr Baker said: ‘The Liberal Democrats want to transform community relations and restore the public’s trust in the police. 'Far too many innocent people are subjected to stop and search, which is often based on crude stereotyping of minorities. Stop and search has led to tension, and it’s something that cannot be ignored' Norman Baker, Home Office minister . ‘Far too many innocent people are subjected to stop and search, which is often based on crude stereotyping of minorities. ‘Stop and search has led to tension, and it’s something that cannot be ignored.

The survey by BBC Good Food Magazine found that just 4 per cent of people could correctly say when plums were in season and 5 per cent knew the three months blackberries were ripe for eating, while 10 per cent guessed correctly for gooseberries, and 9 per cent for outdoor rhubarb. Scroll down for video . Less than one in 10 people know when some of the UK's most well-known fruit and vegetables are in season . Even for one of the most popular seasonal fruits, strawberries, less than a quarter knew that they were in season in June, July and August. The scores were just as low for vegetables, with only 7 per cent correctly naming that asparagus is in season in April, May and June. The best performance was for new potatoes, but only 13 per cent correctly named May, June and July as the key months. The poll of more than 2,000 people found that 11 per cent could get the seasonal months for corn on the cob correct, and 12 per cent for pumpkins, but only 9 per cent could correctly name the months when broad beans were at their peak. Despite the lack of knowledge, the vast majority of people thought it was important to shop seasonally, with 78 per cent claiming to look actively for food that is in season. But only a third felt that supermarkets helped them to shop seasonally. More than four fifths of those who tried to shop seasonally said they wanted to support British farmers, while almost three quarters wanted fresher produce and 70 per cent were keen for a better taste. Of those who did not actively look for produce that was in season, almost half said it was because they wanted to eat their favourite food all year round, while 39 per cent admitted to being unaware of what the seasons for food were.

Gillian Carter, BBC Good Food Magazine editor, said: 'Cooking with the seasons has always given a delicious structure to the cook's calendar, but our survey shows this traditional rhythm is under threat. 'Although many of the respondents could hazard a guess, very few knew the exact months that produce was in season. 'The good news for British producers is that most people want to do more to specifically support them. The survey should be food for thought for supermarkets whose customers feel they are not helping them to shop seasonally.' Writing in the September issue of BBC Good Food Magazine investigative food journalist Joanna Blythman said: 'The supermarkets' obsession with stocking every fruit and vegetable grown on the planet, every day of the year, makes it hard to detect the ebb and flow of seasonal produce.' She said food seasons were also being blurred by changes to the weather. But she said: 'Buying fruit and vegetables at their seasonal peak has always been the surest way to nose out the freshest, best-tasting, ripest produce, and that guiding principle is as relevant as it ever was.'","Less than 10 per cent could name seasonal months for home-grown produce .

But according to a survey, one in ten people do not have a single friend to call their own, while a lonely one in five confess to rarely or never feeling loved. Nearly half of those polled – 42 per cent – say they have no friends at work to make the nine-to-five routine more bearable. A survey by the relationship charity Relate has found one in ten people do not have a single friend to call their own . Relate, the relationship charity which carried out the survey, said while the vast majority do have at least one close friend, it is 'concerning' that one in ten do not. The poll of more than 5,000 people, which looked at all aspects of relationships, found that 91 per cent have at least one good friend. It also revealed a clear gender difference between how close we feel to the friends we have – 81 per cent of women described the quality of their friendships as good or very good, compared to only 73 per cent of men. Women also reported that their friendships improve with age, whereas men's remain the same throughout life. Ruth Sutherland, chief executive of Relate, said: 'This new study examines the quality of our relationships, showing a clear link between our personal relationships and our well-being. Whilst there is much to celebrate, the results around how close we feel to others are very concerning. 'There is a significant minority of people who claim to have no close friends, or who never or rarely feel loved - something which is unimaginable to many of us.

The survey found a quarter (24 per cent) of people are not satisfied with their sex lives, while more than one in three (35 per cent) think their bosses believe the most productive employees put work before family. It also found that 85 per cent of people have good relationships with their partners, but while the vast majority of people in relationships feel close to their other halves, there are also some concerning statistics in this section, Relate said. A total of 24 per cent of people report having an affair, and the counselling service said the numbers of people who rarely or never feel loved are 'worryingly high'. The study found a clear link between high-quality relationships and high levels of well-being. But simply being in a relationship does not guarantee that people will feel good about themselves - single people feel better about themselves than those in average, bad or very bad relationships, suggesting it is the quality of the relationship that has an impact on well-being and happiness, Relate said.","Relate, the relationship charity, said survey results are 'concerning'

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Pampered poultry, step this way - to the new hen hotel. Sam Jones, 18, is charging £1 a night to look after pet chickens while their owners are on holiday. He is currently laying the foundations for his 'Chickens on Holiday' venture at Greenlands Farm Village, in Carnforth, Lancashire, where he works as an operations supervisor. 18-year-old Sam Jones is pictured with some of the chickens staying at his new 'hen hotel' in Lancashire . The enterprising teenager offers the pampered poultry everything they could want for their all-inclusive break, including family hutch accommodation, an abundance of fresh food, water and straw and even leftover cakes and scones. He has only just started small-scale advertising but has been shocked by the number of people getting in touch, desperate to pack their chickens off, so they can enjoy a week in the sun. Celebrities like Amanda Holden (pictured) who keeps chickens, has made the poultry trendy as pets . He said: 'There are more and more people keeping chickens as pets. 'When they go on holiday, maybe they can't rely on family members or neighbours. 'There . is a market for somebody to board chickens and, after just putting a . few posters on lamp posts and Facebook, I can't believe how much . interest there has already been.' An estimated 500,000 households now keep chickens in Britain, sparked by celebrity poultry devotees such as chef Jamie Oliver model Liz Hurley and presenter Amanda Holden, as well as a trend for organic produce. Mr Jones, who charges £1 per chicken per night with discounts for long stays, is now competing with a growing number of animal boarding businesses across the country, which are cashing in on the craze. But he intends to stay ahead of the game with plans to host larger flocks and even branching out into families' waterborne pets. He added: 'I am also looking at trying to do holidays for waterfowl, ducks and geese. 'I have been surprised that I've been getting quite a few people saying they have around 35 birds. I was expecting four to six. 'I think if people have kids, it is a way of learning how and where food comes from. 'There are a lot more families who are starting to get a few chickens in the back garden. 'If you are out at work all day, it's not like a dog where you are having to let them out every hour.' Chicken owner Sam Cook, 33, of Mearnskirk, East Renfrewshire, keeps a small peep of chickens in her garden near a golf course. The IT worker said: 'I think it's a great idea. 'When I go away, I have people I can call on to feed the chickens, but it's a bind for them to have to get up early. 'Knowing there are places you can safely drop them off when you go away on holiday is a bit of a godsend to be honest.'","Sam Jones, 18, has set up 'Chickens on Holiday' for pet owners jetting off .

"By . Candace Sutton For Daily Mail Australia . Keli Lane previously appealed her conviction for the murder of her daughter Tegan at the Supreme Court of NSW in 2010 . Baby killer Keli Lane's last hope of overturning her murder conviction has been lost, after the High Court rejected her bid to appeal. Lane was found guilty in 2010 of murdering her newborn daughter Tegan Lee Lane within hours of leaving Auburn Hospital in September 1996 with the baby, whose remains have never been found. After leaving the hospital the 39-year-old water polo player then went to her parents' home, before attending a wedding that afternoon. In 2011 she was jailed for a maximum term of 18 years. She is currently incarcerated in Australia's toughest women's jail, Silverwater Women's Correctional Centre in western Sydney. Currently, Lane would not be eligible for parole until she has served thirteen years and six months, on May 12, 2023. Her appeal to the High Court was her final avenue to have her murder conviction overturned, following a rejected bid by the NSW Court of Criminal Appeal last December, which reportedly had her distraught and hyperventilating in her Silverwater jail cell. But on Friday, Australia's highest court rejected her application for special leave to appeal. Keli Lane was almost one of Australia's golden girls – a private schoolgirl and talented sportswoman with hopes of representing her country at the 2000 Sydney Olympics. But it all came crashing down due to a secret she kept for 14 years – the baby girl who vanished within days of her giving birth – and today convicted child murderer Keli Lane lost her last desperate bid to win freedom from jail. Lane (pictured left in 2006 attending court and right in 1996 at a friend's 21st) gave birth in secret to Tegan Lee Lane in 1996. Two days later she attended a friend's wedding without the baby, who was not seen again . Tall, blonde Keli Lane was a familiar and admired figure in the Sydney surfside suburb of Manly before her stunning and tragic fall from grace. She is the daughter of a well-known surfer, rugby player and retired NSW police inspector, Robert Lane. An elite water polo player at national and international level, Lane was a member of the silver-medal winning Australian Junior Women's team at the 1995 World Championships in Quebec, and it was her ambition to represent Australia in water polo at the 2000 Sydney Olympic Games. It was perhaps this that led to her disposing of her baby - Lane became pregnant, but could not afford to care for child while pursuing her sporting ambitions. On 12 September 1996, Lane, aged 21, gave birth in secret to Tegan Lee Lane at Auburn Hospital in western Sydney. Two days after giving birth to the child, Lane and her boyfriend attended a friend's wedding and there was no sign of the baby, nor were people aware of her pregnancy - including her boyfriend. It was as if the child had never existed. Keli Lane (right) was an elite waterpolo player and hoped to represent Australia in water polo at the 2000 Sydney Olympic Games . Lane had a troubled history with pregnancies, which she had either terminated or given away the child soon after birth. She finally had a fourth child, who now visits Lane in prison. Lane's downfall came when a Department of Community Services officer became suspicious about the existence of a missing child and an investigation was made into the birth of Tegan. Lane first told police that Tegan was living with a family in Perth. She said the father was a man called Andrew Morris, which she later changed to Andrew Norris, and that she had handed him the child in the Auburn Hospital car park. After a controversial - and traumatic four-month trial - Lane was convicted in December 2010 of lying under oath and of murdering her baby Tegan.

Tostee's apartment is in Avalon Riverfront Apartments, an ultra-modern 32-storey riverside block in the heart of Surfers Paradise. The building lies between Cavill Avenue and the Nerang River, and is just a 500m walk from the night club and bar strip on Orchid Avenue frequented by Tostee. Avalon's apartments feature views of the river, city skyline and ocean off the south-east Queensland coast. Residents have access to a gym and sauna, and the penthouse flat has a private roof garden. Ms Wright would have entered the building through a sleek designer foyer and taken the lift to the 14th-floor flat, which is around 45m above street level.

"By . Richard Shears In Bali For Mailonline . Wealthy socialite Sheila von Weise Mack had a blazing row with her daughter and the teenager's boyfriend over a hotel bill hours before her body was found crammed into a blood-stained suitcase on the holiday island of Bali. Witnesses have told police that Mrs Mack, her 19-year-old daughter Heather and boyfriend Tommy Schaefer, 21, had a row at the reception desk of the luxury St Regis Hotel on Wednesday morning before her body was shuffled from the hotel in a silver suitcase. Staff have told police that the three argued about who should pay the bill when they were due to check out on Thursday. Scroll down for video . Suspect: Heather Mack at the police HQ in Bali. Hotel staff have told MailOnline how she and her boyfriend were arguing over the bill in the lobby the night before Sheila von Weise Mack's body was found stuffed in a suitcase . Uncooperative: Heather has been refusing to talk to police and has been demanding that she has a U.S. lawyer . Confrontation: The teenager and her mother pictured on one of their many exotic holidays. The night before her death witnesses said she told her daughter angrily: 'I paid for his (the boyfriend's flight), you pay the hotel bill' According . to a staff reconstruction of the argument, Mrs Mack, from Chicago, was seen pointing at . Mr Schaefer, who had checked in after the couple earlier in the week, . and telling her daughter:'I’ve paid for his flight here, so the two of you should pay for the hotel.' The . three of them left the lobby area after the row but a few hours later, . at 11.26am, Ms Mack and Mr Schaefer arrived in the reception area with a . large suitcase wrapped in a bed sheet, refusing to allow a porter to . take it out to a waiting taxi. The 'body in the suitcase' murder is a story spiced with tragedy, involving . a troubled young woman, Mr Schaefer, whose previous girlfriend was . killed in a car crash in South Africa in April, and a wealthy widow who . met a grisly death in a tropical paradise. Staff . at the $650 St Regis hotel told of the strange behaviour of Miss Mack, . who would instantly change from being friendly with them to storming . around the opulent lobby and the pool area in an aggressive manner and . glaring angrily at those who approached her. Police . sources in the Bali capital, Denpasar, said that both Mr Schaefer and . Ms Mack were being questioned but the couple are refusing to . co-operate and are demanding a lawyer from the US. Witnesses . reported that she and her mother were seen arguing on a number of . occasions at the hotel, causing some staff to be concerned that the . couple might even come to blows. 'The . mother had all the appearances of one of our upmarket guests,' said a . staff member, 'but the behaviour she and her daughter showed did not . belong in our hotel. Even so, it’s such a tragic end for that poor . woman.' Held: . Schaefer is escorted by a policeman for questioning in connection with . the murder. He sent a Facebook message some days before his trip hinting . that he may never return from Indonesia . Lovebirds: The couple started dating after the tragic death of Schaefer's girlfriend in a car crash in April . After . carrying the suitcase containing Mrs Mack’s body out to the taxi, Ms . Mack and Mr Schaefer  returned to the reception desk and said they . would not be paying the bill - it would be taken care of by Mrs Mack . when she checked out later. But . it is claimed they did ask for a safety deposit box, believed to . contain Mrs Mack’s jewellery and their passports, to be opened and its . contents given to them. The staff refused because they said Mrs Mack had . left instructions that only she should be allowed to open it. Ms . Mack and Mr Schaefer said they had more bags to collect - but instead . they went out through the back entrance and later ordered another taxi . to take them to the airport. Denpasar police chief Djoko Hariutomo said they approached immigration officials claiming they had lost their passports. 'They . said the needed to get new passports in order to leave the country, but . that was because the passports were locked inside the deposit box at . the hotel,' said Mr Djoko. After . being told by immigration officials that lost passports had to be . reported to respective embassies, the couple vanished again, this time . taking a taxi to the four star Risata Bali Resort, a short distance from . the airport. With . an alert going out to all hotels and taxis, police received a call from . staff at the Risata where, raiding a room at 8.30am on Wednesday, . police found the couple asleep and arrested them. As . police began the difficult task of trying to question the pair in . detail, fingerprint experts were examining pieces of glass from an . unidentified object that is believed to have been used to bludgeon Mrs . Mack in room 616 in the hope of finding clues as to whether it was Ms . Mack or Mr Schaefer who had last touched the suspected murder weapon. While . suspicion remains on both young people, as they were the only ones seen . entering the room on CCTV footage, police said their initial inquiries . suggested the perpetrator of the crime was the daughter. Rages: . At the $650 St Regis hotel staff told of the strange behaviour of . Heather, who would instantly change from being friendly with them to . storming around the opulent lobby and the pool area in an aggressive . manner and glaring angrily at those who approached her . They . have both been subjected to blood and urine tests to check if the pair . were on drugs, but officers said psychological tests and Ms Mack’s . behaviour suggested she was 'unpredictable'. In . a bizarre twist, the couple, who are being interviewed separately, have . told police that Mrs Mack had been killed by an armed gang who had then . taken the two of them captive before they were able to escape. 'They . have both told the same story about the armed gang, but clearly this is . something they have concocted before their arrest, as there is . absolutely no evidence from the CCTV cameras to show they were captured . by a gang,' police said. From . both the US and Indonesia, reports have emerged telling of Mrs Mack’s . troubled daughter, who is understood to have been adopted. An . insight into the family background and Ms Mack’s psychological problems . has come from a writer to the Jakarta Post who said she was the same . age as Heather, having been friends with her for years. 'Heather . has always been a very disturbed girl. She was extremely spoiled and would often scream and throw things until . she got her way,' the writer said. 'In . 2006, Sheila and her husband were vacationing on a cruise ship when . something went wrong and her husband cut his foot due to negligence. Sheila sued the cruise ship and won a sizeable amount of money. 'Heather became even crazier with the newly-inherited millions.' The . former friend added: 'I have absolutely no idea what Tommy saw in . Heather or what would bring him to' - allegedly - 'participate in the . murder'. 'Tommy . recently lost the love of his life. In April, Tommy’s long-time . girlfriend, Rachel Smylie, passed away in a car accident in Cape Town, . South Africa. 'I guess Tommy and Heather started dating after Rachel’s death and I’m saddened that he got caught up in Heather’s insanity. Sheila was an incredibly nice, educated woman. Horror: . The blood-stained suitcase where the body of Mrs von Wiese-Mack was . found. It was left in a cab when Mack and Schaefer checked out of the . hotel, but they failed to return and the driver went to police . 'She . was always dressed to the 9s, even while running errands.

The case against Tostee - who has boasted about his conquests online - was brought about after police seized footage allegedly showing the meeting between him and Ms Wright when they connected via mobile dating app Tinder. according to The Daily Telegraph. Tostee has also previously revealed he was 'obsessed' with recording videos on an online bodybuilding forum. Ms Wright was on a two-week holiday for a friend's wedding but the trip took a tragic turn when her body was found in the early morning hours of Friday, August 8, at the bottom of the Wahroonga Place building. Within minutes, police arrived at the scene after a male witness raised the alarm and searched the apartment from which she fell, but it was empty. Hours later, Tostee presented himself to police at the Surfers Paradise station where he was questioned for more than two hours with his lawyer before being released without charge. At the time, police said Tostee had 'exercised his right to silence'. The 28-year-old also took to social media to deny his involvement in Ms Wright's death.

In her sister's honour, Reza lit a candlelight and had a beer at the site where Ms Wright's body was found, according to The Daily Telegraph. Leading up to Tostee's arrest, it was revealed he was a regular on the Gold Coast's party strip and often visited nightclubs such as Crazy Horse, Cocktails, Club Liv, Bourbon Bar, Players, Alive, Vanity and Sin City. But he was banned from two of them after staff deemed his behaviour as 'creepy'. A bouncer at one of the clubs along the strip told Daily Mail Australia Mr Tostee would obsessively film events with his phone and in one case a violent incident outside a club until he was told to leave. Tostee hit back at reports police took footage away from his Gold Coast unit of his conquests. Footage aired on Nine News earlier this week reportedly shows Mr Tostee hosting a girl in an apartment. It shows a woman apparently stealing his wallet before leaving in the middle of the night. 'This footage was from a security camera in the living room of my previous apartment at Circle on Cavill in 2012. I only had one other camera in the apartment which was at the front entry facing the door. Neither camera was used to film sexual encounters,' Tostee wrote on Facebook.

During investigations, Detective Superintendent Dave Hutchinson said police had obtained statements from 'a number of women'. Detectives also interviewed his parents Gray and Helene Tostee at their home in a gated community in Carrara, where their son had been hiding out since the incident happened. 'He has exercised his right to silence,' Det Supt Hutchinson told Daily Mail Australia earlier this week. Supt Hutchinson said a 'forensic procedure order' had been carried out against Tostee, which is believed to have included blood samples and a DNA swab. Despite his refusal to talk to police, Tostee took to a body building forum three times on Monday to talk about the investigation. At 10.21am, he wrote on the forum: 'I've been advised not to go into details but all I will say is that I absolutely did NOT cause this girl to fall and that I am devastated about what happened to her.' About an hour later, he posted again: 'Fact is I’ve taken home probably about 150 girls from clubs over the last few years. When you go out often to the same places and get drunk and talk to girls you’re bound to get noticed and hated on, and people gossip. 'Eventually it turns into Chinese whispers where people have a completely false impression of you. 'Most people who know me have been completely supportive, it's those who don't know me at all who assume the worst.' Thirteen minutes later, at 11.31am, he added: 'My reputation has already been destroyed without me saying anything at all. It’s nothing I haven’t already posted in this thread, but that’s all I have to say for now.' Video footage that appeared on Nine News reportedly shows Gable Tostee hosting a woman in his apartment .

Wran didn't apply for bail and it was formally refused. She did not appear in the dock but her lawyer Winston Terracini SC said she would plead not guilty. The matter was adjourned until October 8. She will be held in Silverwater jail. Haines was refused bail on Wednesday and is due to reappear at Central Local Court on October 9. Lee will reappear on October 8. Court documents showed Wran was unemployed and received a Newstart Allowance of $560 per fortnight from Centrelink.

Harriet Wran's barrister Winston Terracini outside Liverpool Local Court on Thursday. He said his client would deny murder . Ms Wran (pictured here with her brother, Hugo) was questioned by police in Cabramatta on Wednesday . Sources say McNulty was not known to Wran before the attack. As well as McNulty, a second man, Brett Fitzgerald, 42, was stabbed several times in the attack and remains in a stable condition at St Vincent's Hospital. Haines' arrest came after Fitzgerald told police the attack had been carried out by three people in their 30s and 40s. Friends of McNulty have paid tribute to the musician on Facebook, the Sydney Morning Herald reports. Harriet Wran's mother Jill Hickson was driven home by her son Hugo Wran (left) to their house in Woollahra after Harriet's court appearance . Her mother Jill Hickson was glued to her phone as they arrived home . 'Your sharp wit, world observations, humour and brilliant dance moves will be missed my friend. Rest in Peace,' one said. 'Daniel was a funny, talented and gifted musician who had an on going battle with addiction,' another wrote. Wran is part of Australia's wealthy establishment royalty, the daughter of one of the nation's most celebrated political leaders and his glamorous academic second wife, nee Jill Hickson. A second man (pictured), 42, was stabbed multiple times in the attack and he remains in St Vincent's Hospital in a stable condition . Police surrounded the unit where Daniel McNulty died at the scene . Hugo Wran arrives home to the Wran property in Woollahra after his sister Harriet was arrested for murder and held at Cabramatta Police station . She was born in 1988 into a privileged existence created by her barrister turned politician father who had come from humble beginnings in the then Sydney working class suburb of Balmain. She attended prestigious private schools Ascham in Edgecliff and Sydney Church of England Girls Grammar School (SCEGGS) in Darlinghurst before studying modern history at the University of Sydney. Mr Wran was the son of a seaman and coal lumper who ended up as a Queen's Counsel to the NSW bar, premier of the state and an icon of the Australian Labor Party. Neville Wran died in April this year. He is pictured here with his wife Jill and his two children, Harriet and Hugo . Ms Wran is the daughter of former NSW premier Neville Wran, pictured here with his wife Jill in 2008 . On Sunday, emergency crews arrived at a unit block on Walker Street about 7.45pm and found a man with multiple stab wounds. Following investigations, a red 1998 model Toyota sedan was located by police in the Waterloo region about 3pm on Wednesday. Superintendent Luke Freudenstein on Monday said the attack, while not pre-meditated, was not random either. 48-year-old Daniel McNaulty was murdered at the notorious inner-Sydney housing commission unit block . It is not yet clear what motivated the stabbings, but it is likely the attackers knew the victims and the violence may have escalated from an argument, police said at the time. Neighbours reported hearing screams and yelling. A senior police source told The Sydney Morning Herald Wran was believed to have ties with Sydney's drug scene. A friend - who did not wish to be named - said the 26-year-old started seeing a bikie when her relationship with an architect ended. Ms Wran (right) was by Neville Wran's bedside when he died earlier this year in April . A 48-year-old man died and another 42-year-old man was taken to hospital in the double stabbing, Ms Wran (right) has been charged over . At her father's funeral, Ms Wran wore long sleeves to cover up the tattoos had on her arms. 'I would be very surprised if Neville had any idea,' the friend told The Sydney Morning Herald. A state funeral was held for Ms Wran's father who was premier of NSW between 1976 and 1986, on May 1 in Sydney after his death in April this year. Harriet Wran was at his side when the brilliant and controversial Australian politician died. She is the first child of the second marriage of the most electorally successful politician and premier of NSW, with Jill Hickson who was to become a prominent publishing figure. In 1976, at 50 years of age, former barrister Neville Wran rose to become the most powerful man in the state. The alleged murder took place at an apartment block on Walker St in Redfern . The 26-year-old studied modern history at the University of Sydney and went to private schools Ascham and SCEGGS . A 35-year-old was also taken into custody along with a 26-year-old woman in Liverpool . Harriet Wran will be represented by one of Australia's top lawyers, Winston Terracini, when she appears in court. The 26-year-old has turned to the best criminal silk to fight her murder charge, the Daily Telegraph reports. He specialises in complex murder and manslaughter cases and is renowned for his cross-examination skills. His former clients include Gordon Wood, who was acquitted of the murder of his girlfriend Caroline Byrne in 2012, and Keli Lane, the former Australian water polo player who was convicted of the 1996 murder of her newborn baby Tegan. The criminal barrister recently represented millionaire property mogul Ron Medich who was accused of ordering the murder of his former business associate Michael McGurk. Months later, he married then-Qantas executive Hickson, following his divorce from his first wife Marcia, with whom he had a daughter, Kim, and an adopted son, Glenn. The marriage to Jill Hickson created controversy as did Mr Wran's premiership which resulted in corruption allegations which overshadowed Neville 'Nifty' Wran's entire premiership. Jill Hickson Wran gave birth to Harriet in 1988 and Hugo in 1991. Mr Wran agonised over being an 'older father' to his second family, but his children Harriet and Hugo were reportedly devoted to him as he retired from public life and entered his senior years. In 2006, Jill and Neville separated, and their marriage suffered upheavals over the next few years before they reconciled in 2011, not long before Mr Wran moved to an aged care facility in Sydney's eastern suburbs favoured by former political powerhouse leaders, Lulworth House at Elizabeth Bay. Neville Wran reportedly suffered dementia before his death, aged 87, in April this year. Harriet Wran and her brother, Hugo, accompanied their mother Jill to the public memorial for their father's life in Sydney Town Hall. Following her father's death, Harriet Wran became a factor in a reportedly contested will between Jill Hickson and Neville Wran's four children Kim, Glenn, from his first marriage, and Harriet and Hugo, who are believed to be the main beneficiaries of his multimillion-dollar estate. The inheritance is said to include prime real estate - including a home in the exclusive Sydney suburb of Woollahra, a beach house in the multimillion dollar property location of Palm Beach and a farm in the Yarramalong Valley on the NSW Central Coast. A senior police source says Ms Wran is believed to be caught up in Sydney's drug scene . Wran is an ice addict who relapsed following the death of her father Neville in April .

"By . Mail Online Reporter . The United States has thrown its weight behind Iraq's new president Fouad Massoum just hours after the country's embattled Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki accused him of violating the constitution. Mr al-Maliki accused Kurdish Mr Massoum, who was named president last month, of neglecting to name a prime minister from the country's largest parliamentary faction by Sunday's deadline. He said Massoum has violated the constitution 'for the sake of political goals.' Deadlock: Iraq's Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki, left, accused president Fouad Massoum, right, of violating the constitution . But The U.S. state department said it 'fully supports' Mr Massoum and rejects any effort to use coercion or manipulation in the process of choosing a new Iraqi leader. State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said the U.S. supports the process to select a prime minister 'by building a national consensus and governing in an inclusive manner.' Al-Maliki's surprise speech late Sunday plunged the government into a political crisis at a time it is battling advances by Islamic State militants. Special forces loyal to al-Maliki were . deployed in strategic areas  of Baghdad on Sunday night after he . delivered a tough speech  indicating he would not cave in to pressure to . drop a bid for a  third term, police sources said. Pro-Maliki . Shi'ite militias stepped up patrols in the  capital, police said. An . eyewitness said a tank was stationed at  the entrance to Baghdad's Green . Zone, which houses government  buildings. Al-Maliki is seeking a third term as prime minister, but the latest crisis has prompted even his closest allies to call for his resignation. A parliament session scheduled for Monday to discuss the election and who might lead the next Iraqi government was postponed until Aug. 19. Shi'ite Iraqis rally in support for Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, over the weekend. He has accused Mr Massoum, a Kurd, of violating the constitution 'for the sake of political goals' The . Islamic State has capitalized on political deadlock and sectarian . tensions that have made it easier for the group to make fresh gains . after arriving in the north in June from Syria. The . group, which sees Shi'ites as infidels who deserve to be killed, has . ruthlessly moved through one town after another, using tanks and heavy . weapons it seized from soldiers who fled in the thousands. Islamic . State militants have killed hundreds of Iraq's minority Yazidis, burying . some alive and taking women as slaves, an Iraqi government minister . said on Sunday, as U.S. warplanes again bombed the insurgents. President . Barack Obama last week approved limited airstrikes against Islamic . State fighters, saying the current military campaign would be a . 'long-term project' to protect civilians from the deadly and brutal . insurgents. U.S. officials said the dispute between al-Maliki and Massoum centers on the . specifics of the deadline for nominees to replace the prime minister. While al-Maliki believes the deadline was Sunday, other Iraqi leaders . believe the deadline is Monday afternoon. The officials said the U.S. believes there is flexibility for the deadline to extend into Monday. The . U.S. officials said the Obama administration had no confirmation of . such developments, but said there was an increased security presence in . Baghdad. The . chairwoman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Sen. Dianne Feinstein . of California, also said the militants pose a threat 'in our backyard' and were recruiting Westerners. 'Inaction is no longer an option,' she said in a statement as airstrikes were underway. Thousands of minority Yezidi Iraqis flee Islamic State militants who have reportedly killed hundreds, burying some alive and taking women as slaves . The . rhetoric tracked closely to that used in the lead-up to the 2003 . invasion of Iraq. In the wake of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, lawmakers . from both parties voted to give President George W. Bush the authority . to take military action against Iraq in the hopes of combating . terrorism. At the time, many said the United States faced a choice of fighting terrorism on American soil or on foreign soil. A . close White House ally, Democratic Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois, said . Islamic State fighters are a 'growing and troublesome' threat. But he . added, 'We must not send the troops.' 'The big question is: What can the United States do to stop it?' Durbin asked. American airstrikes have included attacks by fighter pilots and drones near Irbil, the capital of the Kurdish region in northern Iraq, as recently as Sunday. The strikes are aimed at limiting Islamic State fighters' advances and helping Iraqi forces regain control. U.S. and Iraqi aircraft also have dropped humanitarian aid for the minority Yazidis, thousands of whom have been stranded on a mountaintop since the Islamic militants seized Sinjar, near the Syrian border, last week. U.S. Central Command reported that the U.S. military conducted a fourth airdrop of food and water Sunday. The State Department said Sunday it had relocated a limited number of staff members from the U.S. consulate general in Irbil. Spokeswoman Jen Psaki said the move was made 'out of an abundance of caution rather than any one specific threat.' Staffing at the U.S. embassy in Baghdad 'remains the same,' she said. Talks between Washington and al-Maliki that would have allowed U.S. troops to remain in Iraq collapsed in 2008, and Obama withdrew troops in 2011. Al-Maliki now is under mounting pressure to step aside, including requests from U.S. lawmakers. 'The collapse of Mosul was not a result of lack of equipment or lack of personnel. It was a leadership collapse,' said Sen. Jack Reed, D-R.I. 'And so in order to put the situation right, we have to begin at the fundamental core, which is leadership in Baghdad, Iraqi leadership.'","U.S. bid to break crippling deadlock in Iraqi government .

"By . Candace Sutton For Daily Mail Australia . and Daniel Piotrowski For Daily Mail Australia . The sister of balcony death victim Warriena Tagpuno Wright will make a public plea tomorrow for information which might solve the mystery of the 26-year-old's tragic death. Reza Tagpuno will brave the glare of a media press conference at the Surfers Paradise Police Station on the central Gold Coast at 11am on Thursday. Ms Tagpuno will be the first family member of the late Ms Wright's family to be seen since her sister's dramatic and fatal fall in the early hours of last Friday morning. Scroll down for video . Warriena Tagpuno Wright, 26, died on Friday after she was last seen on the balcony of Gable Tostee's 14th floor home at the Avalon Apartment complex . Gable Tostee (far right) in his underwear at a Mr Right competition at Shooters Superclub on the Gold Coast in 2011 . Sin City manager Ty Davidson said Tostee was banned from a number of clubs, including Sin City and Vanity . Tostee was a regular at Sin City and other clubs on the Gold Coast's party strip . Nine News reported Ms Tagpuno, who flew into Queensland with Ms Wright's mother, Beth Wright, on Wednesday morning, will make her appeal in a bid for information and to gain their very private family answers and some closure. Her family's arrival came three weeks after Ms Wright landed in Australia for a much-anticipated holiday for a friend's wedding. Ms Wright's mother, Wellington church deacon Beth Wright, and her sister, Reza Tagpuno, flew into Brisbane and met with detectives from the task force investigating the young woman's death. Dressed all in black, Beth Wright - who is a senior member of the Seventh Day Adventist Church in Porirua, New Zealand - kept her head bowed as she and Ms Tagpuno were accompanied through the airport. Video footage that appeared on Nine News reportedly shows Gable Tostee hosting a woman in his apartment . The woman is dressed in a white top and dark-coloured skirt walking around inside an apartment . They arrived two days after the completion of a post-mortem on Warriena Wright who plunged to her death from the 14th floor of the Avalon Apartments at Surfers Paradise on the Gold Coast in the early hours of last Friday morning. Ms Wright fell to her death following an evening at the home of Gold Coast labourer Gable Tostee, who she had met on dating site Tinder. She was in the final days of her Australian trip for a friend's wedding, before she was meant to be flying back to her native New Zealand. Mr Tostee, who has declined to make a statement to police about the incident, has denied via social media any involvement in Ms Wright's death. He has also hit back at reports police took footage away from his Gold Coast unit of his conquests. But footage aired on Nine News reportedly shows Mr Tostee hosting a girl in an apartment. On Wednesday, one scientific officer, a police photographer and a fire officer went up in the bucket of a cherry picker to collect fibres, human remains and DNA from the outside of the 14th and 13th floor balconies. While forensic investigations unfolded, Ms Tagpuno gave a statement at the Gold Coast police headquarters about her sister. On Tuesday, a visibly upset Ms Tagpuno said she was going through a hard time before leaving New Zealand and her sister was a 'very private person'. Since the tragedy, it has emerged the man being investigated over the death of the female tourist had been banned from a number of nightclubs in the area for being 'creepy' and filming people - including women - on his mobile phone. Gable Tostee, 28, made contact with Stephanie Angus on Tinder and sent her the alarming message 10 months ago . Ms Angus, who works as a producer in Sydney for the Channel Nine program, said she stopped messaging Mr Tostee soon after receiving this message . Mr Tostee is part of a police investigation following the death of a female tourist who fell from his apartment balcony at the Gold Coast on Friday . Gable Tostee, 28, is a regular on the Gold Coast's party strip and often visited nightclubs such as Crazy Horse, Cocktails, Club Liv, Bourbon Bar, Players, Alive, Vanity and Sin City. In a long-running Facebook thread seen by Daily Mail Australia, nine Gold Coast women recounted their run-ins with Mr Tostee. 'Woah that's so f***ed,’ one woman replied to the news that Warriena Tagpuno Wright plunging to her death after meeting Mr Tostee. Another replied: 'You would remember him hun, everyone in the [nightclub] industry does'. She added she 'always’ thought there was ‘something not right about this guy'. Another participant recalled: 'Honestly I've had so many run ins with this guy.' Yet another said: 'Omg!! I remember this dude! He was sooooo weird. Him and his mate would go home and change their shirts half way through the night.' 'OMFG. I met this guy on Tinder four months ago,' wrote another participant woman, before detailing her an encounter with him. Detectives revisit the balcony on Wednesday from which Warriena Tagpuno Wright fell to her death . People lay flowers at the Avalon Apartment building on Wednesday, Warriena Tagpuno Wright fell to her death from a 14-floor balcony last week . Mr Tostee was barred from Vanity and Sin City after staff decided they did not like his behaviour. ‘He was just creepy,’ Sin City manager Ty Davidson said. ‘He was here all the time. Everyone along here knows him. Even after he was banned, he’d come on nights when the bouncer didn’t know him and try and get back in.’ A bouncer at one of the clubs along the strip told Daily Mail Australia Mr Tostee would obsessively film events with his phone and in one case a violent incident outside a club until he was told to leave. He entered a ‘Mr Right’ male model search competition at Shooters three years ago and was banned from Vanity in 2012, and from Sin City some time after that. The latest developments in the investigation into the death of New Zealand tourist Warriena Tagpuno Wright come as it was revealed he sent another young woman a 'creepy' message that 'insinuated violence' after they connected on dating app Tinder last year. Tostee, 28, made contact with Stephanie Angus  on Tinder and sent her the alarming message 10 months ago. 'The first message was ""Roses are red, violets are blue. I have a gun. Now get in my van"" and I thought looking back it was quite creepy,' Ms Angus told A Current Affair. 'It was quite a scary thing for him to have written to me. It was quite a strange thing and it insinuated violence and that's quite a worry.' Ms Angus said her best friend in Brisbane had also made contact with Mr Tostee on Tinder around the same time as her last year . Ms Angus said he has been back on Tinder in the days following Ms Wright's death. Ms Angus, who works as a producer in Sydney for the Channel Nine program, said she stopped messaging Mr Tostee soon after. 'I found him to be a bit sleazy and he wasn't the type of bloke I was looking to meet. He was on there for one reason and I was on there for another reason,' she said. Ms Wright, 26, died on Friday after she was last seen on the balcony of Mr Tostee's 14th floor home at the Avalon Apartment complex on the Gold Coast. Mr Tostee has been in the spotlight since police started investigating Ms Wright's death. Witnesses claim to have heard loud screaming and raised voices coming from the 14th floor on Friday. Ms Angus said her best friend in Brisbane had also made contact with Mr Tostee on Tinder around the same time as her last year. 'When we both realised it was him after seeing his photo, we were both extremely worried. It was quite a scary thing to read about,' she said. 'He came across as the sort of guy that's just out there to pick up girls.' Ms Angus said he has been back on Tinder in the days following Ms Wright's death. 'He must have more things going on in his life, most important issues that checking who he's been matched with on a dating site,' she said. Mr Tostee so far hasn't provided police with information about what happened when Ms Wright fell to her death, but Detective Superintendent Dave Hutchinson said they have obtained statements from 'a number of women'. Police were at the 14th floor of the Avalon Apartments on the Gold Coast on Tuesday as part of their investigation . Detectives have also interviewed his parents Gray and Helene Tostee at their home in a gated community in Carrara, west of the Gold Coast tourist strip. 'He has exercised his right to silence, ' Mr Hutchinson told Daily Mail Australia. Supt Hutchinson said a 'forensic procedure order' had been carried out against Tostee, which is believed to have included blood samples and a DNA swab. Asked whether Mr Tostee was a person of interest in the case, Mr Hutchinson said: 'Obviously we are investigating the circumstances of the death of a young lady who fell from the balcony of his unit. 'He is going to be part of that investigation.' His lawyer, Michael Purcell, said his client would not be making a statement to police in the foreseeable future. But Mr Tostee took to a body building forum three times on Monday to talk about the investigation. At 10.21am, he wrote on the forum: 'I've been advised not to go into details but all I will say is that I absolutely did NOT cause this girl to fall and that I am devastated about what happened to her.' 11.18am: 'Fact is I’ve taken home probably about 150 girls from clubs over the last few years. When you go out often to the same places and get drunk and talk to girls you’re bound to get noticed and hated on, and people gossip. 'Eventually it turns into Chinese whispers where people have a completely false impression of you. 'Most people who know me have been completely supportive, it's those who don't know me at all who assume the worst.' Thirteen minutes later, at 11.31am, he added, 'My reputation has already been destroyed without me saying anything at all. It’s nothing I haven’t already posted in this thread, but that’s all I have to say for now.'","Gable Tostee, 28, is a regular in Gold Coast nightclubs .

"By . Mail Online Reporter . Hundreds of California parents are outraged over a ninth-grade health textbook including references to sexual anatomy, vibrators, oral sex, bondage, and where to purchase and use a condom. 'Your Health Today' is 392 pages covering everything from fitness to nutrition, but the sections on sex have so disturbed people that roughly 600 of them have signed a petition calling for the Fremont school board to cease teaching students from the book. 'I feel that it's not age appropriate for  these kids,' mother Asfia Ahmed told SF Gate. 'I have read the book from . first page to last, and most pages talk about college kids. It doesn't . relate to these kids at all.' Sections in 'Your Health Today' - pictured here - covering sex have so disturbed people that roughly 600 parents have signed a petition calling for a California school board to cease teaching students from the book . The book is used on health classes for approximately 2,400 students, including Ahmed's to sons. Ahmed . has gone so far as to contact faith-based parent's rights organization . the Pacific Justice Institute over potential legal action to keep . students from viewing the pages devoted to 'sexual response' which . includes the difference between 'excitement,' 'plateau,' 'orgasm,' and . 'resolution.' 'I . was shocked when I looked at the book the first time,"" he said. 'I am . willing to pursue legal action, and I have other parents willing to . support me on this.' Ahmed said he wrote to the book's author, who assured him ninth graders were too young to read it. 'She said the target audience was college freshman,' Ahmed told CBS San Francisco. Still others believed the information was fine for their children. 'The information in there is factual,' Becky Bruno, the mother of a 13-year-old-boy about to start ninth grade, told NBC Bay Area. 'There’s nothing in there that’s going to make him . go exploring more than they have access to on their smartphones or . Internet. Nothing made me feel that it was inappropriate.' District . officials acknowledge that some of the information is more advanced, . but that it's imperative students learn about it before it's too late. State . standards for issues that must be addressed in health include puberty, . STDs, hygiene, sanitary products, and athletic supporters. 'Yes, it talks about masturbation,' school board President Lara Calvert--York told SF Gate. 'We really want . them to have a safe place to get facts about their bodies and how to . handle things and how they need to be mature to deal with these things.' The district's health teachers had a choice of half a dozen textbooks, and voted unanimously to select 'Your Health Today.' The book was then agreed upon by the school board in a 3-2 vote. They . added that beyond simply the sexual information, the books brings . students far more up-to-date than the decade-plus textbook it replaced, . addressing e-cigarettes, gay marriage, and offering more current . information. Fremont school board members say the book provides valuable information to students before it's too late to be of use . 'I . want to let everyone know, if you think sex isn't happening with your . freshmen, you need to take your blinders off,' said campus supervisor Michele Hartmangruber. 'It's happening, and it's . happening in the corners, in the bathrooms, in the cars, in the parks . and even on the 50-yard line in front of everyone.' Though a health class is a requirement for graduation, parents can still opt out of the sexual education aspect. Besides the sexual content, the book has garnered controversy for discussing drinking and alcohol poisoning.

"By . Mail Online Reporter . Ever since California voters backed a measure requiring adult entertainment performers to wear condoms on sets in Los Angeles County, permits for porn production have plummeted. The Los Angeles Times reports that 40 permits for adult productions were issued across the city and county last year, a 90 per cent drop from 2012 when the measure was passed. The law, called Measure B, was pushed by HIV/AIDS activists arguing it would prevent disease outbreaks. Scroll down for video . The Los Angeles Times reports that 40 permits for adult productions were issued across the city and county last year, a 90 per cent drop from 2012 when the measure was passed . The industry argued that mandatory performer testing was already effective and that consumers did not want to purchase pornography that featured condoms. Performers have also contended that condoms can cause rashes and discomfort over long shoots. Only 20 permits have been issued so far this year as of July. Paul Audley, President of FilmL.A. Inc., says the new laws affect far more than just performers. 'It is a cause for concern that people who are manning the . cameras, lights and other things on those sets are not working anymore,' he said. ' It’s not helpful to have another segment of the industry leave the . region.' Filmmakers note that those crew members put millions of dollars into the local economy as residents. Porn crews are mostly traveling to Nevada, Southern California, Florida, and Eastern Europe. Most porn productions have traveled to Southern California, Nevada, or Florida . And . outside cities and states are already drastically affecting production . for more mainstream fare as they offer tax breaks and rebates. 'We’re not shooting in L.A. anymore and, if this goes through, I don’t think you will have any . production in the county of Los Angeles,' Steven Hirsch, founder . and co-chairman of Vivid Entertainment, told reporters.  'We’d like to stay here. This . is our home, where we’ve produced for the last 30 years. But if we’re . forced to move, we will.' AB 1576, a bill that would mandate the expansion of the law statewide is on its way to a state Senate committee next week. A lawsuit challenging Measure B should be in federal appeals court by the year's end. 'There . is no question people are filming without permits,' Michael Weinstein, president of the AIDS Healthcare Foundation told reporters. 'We’re not against porn, we're not trying to drive them out of business. We want to protect the performer and we want them to be a safe industry . like any other industry.'","Permits for adult productions dropped 90 per cent in the year after Measure B passed, requiring condom use .

"By . Candace Sutton For Daily Mail Australia . The man questioned over the balcony death of a young New Zealand woman has denied reports he had secret cameras in his apartment and that police had seized a 'homemade porn' collection. Gable Tostee has been spoken to by detectives but not charged over the death of Warriena Tagpuno Wright, 26. The 28 year old took to Facebook to reject claims police had taken footage away from his Gold Coast unit of his conquests as they tried to piece together the last moments before Ms Wright fell 14 storeys off his balcony. 'I'd like to point out that this article is an outright lie,' he posted. Scroll down for video . Mr Tostee is part of a police investigation following the death of a female tourist who fell from his apartment balcony at the Gold Coast on Friday . 'I never had any cameras installed in my Avalon apartment nor did I have a ""homemade porn collection"". It is a shame that these ""journalists"" have not only twisted facts and taken my comments out of context but have now resorted to fabricating stories. Police confirmed they had not removed the items from the Avalon Apartments property. 'The report that there were homemade pornography tapes is absolutely not true,' Detective Superintendent Dave Hutchinson told Daily Mail Australia. 'We took some discs from the apartment. There are no [sex tapes].' Mr Hutchinson added there was no evidence the apartment was set up with cameras or surveillance equipment. Police have told Daily Mail Australia Mr Tostee had refused to give an interview in relation to Ms Wright's death on Friday. He has not been charged with anything. Warriena Tagpuno Wright, 26, died on Friday after she was last seen on the balcony of Mr Tostee's 14th floor home at the Avalon Apartment complex . Ms Wright, a tourist visiting from New Zealand, reportedly met Mr Tostee on the dating app Tinder while she was in the country for a friend's wedding. The phone of Mr Tostee's friend Tony ­Ongart has also been confiscated by detectives after the pair reportedly made contact after the fatal fall. Mr Ongart took to Facebook on Tuesday to joke about what may be on his phone and to inform friends not to contact him. 'Hope they (police) watch my pornos,' he posted. Mr Tostee has been in the spotlight since police started investigating Ms Wright's death last week. Witnesses claim to have heard loud screaming and raised voices coming from his 14th floor apartment around the time Ms Wright's body was found. 'The examination of mobile phones and other telecommunication devices is a routine part of modern investigations,' Mr Hutchinson said. He said police have obtained statements from 'a number of women'. Mr Tostee had sent Stephanie Angus a 'creepy' message that 'insinuated violence' after they brushed paths on dating app Tinder last year . Ms Angus, who works as a producer in Sydney for the Channel Nine program, said she stopped messaging Mr Tostee soon after receiving this message . Detectives have also interviewed his parents Gray and Helene Tostee at their home in a gated community in Carrara, west of the Gold Coast tourist strip. Mr Hutchinson said a 'forensic procedure order' had been carried out against Tostee,  which is believed to have included blood samples and a DNA swab. Asked whether Mr Tostee was a person of interest in the case, Mr Hutchinson said, 'obviously we are investigating the circumstances of the death of a young lady who fell from the balcony of his unit. 'He is going to be part of that investigation.' It was revealed on Tuesday night that Mr Tostee had sent a young Sydney woman a 'creepy' message that 'insinuated violence' after they brushed paths on dating app Tinder last year. Stephanie Angus said she was sent the alarming message 10 months ago. 'The first message was ""Roses are red, violets are blue. I have a gun. Now get in my van"" and I thought looking back it was quite creepy,' Ms Angus told A Current Affair. 'It was quite a scary thing for him to have written to me. It was quite a strange thing and it insinuated violence and that's quite a worry.' Ms Angus, who works as a producer in Sydney for the Channel Nine program, said she stopped messaging Mr Tostee soon after. Police were at the 14th floor of the Avalon Apartments on the Gold Coast on Tuesday as part of their investigation . His lawyer, Michael Purcell, said his client would not be making a statement to police in the foreseeable future. But Mr Tostee took to a body building forum three times on Monday to talk about the investigation. 'I've been advised not to go into details but all I will say is that I absolutely did NOT cause this girl to fall and that I am devastated about what happened to her,' he wrote on the forum at 10.21am. 'Fact is I’ve taken home probably about 150 girls from clubs over the last few years. When you go out often to the same places and get drunk and talk to girls you’re bound to get noticed and hated on, and people gossip. 'Eventually it turns into Chinese whispers where people have a completely false impression of you. 'Most people who know me have been completely supportive, it's those who don't know me at all who assume the worst. 'My reputation has already been destroyed without me saying anything at all. It’s nothing I haven’t already posted in this thread, but that’s all I have to say for now.' Police leaned over the balcony on the 14th floor on Tuesday as they continued their investigations into Ms Wright's death . Police have obtained statements from 'a number of women' as part of their investigation, but Mr Tostee has refused to give a police statement . A woman who went on a Tinder date with the bodybuilder last September said she believed Mr Tostee was just another 'cocky, arrogant' guy from the Gold Coast. Brisbane woman Deb said she and Mr Tostee exchanged 'corny hook-up lines' and he had invited her to his apartment but she was too afraid to go alone. 'He did invite me to go down but I'm not going to put myself on the 14th floor with someone I don't know. And I have a massive fear of heights. I would never do it by myself,' she told Daily Mail Australia. Instead, Deb invited Tostee to her fifth-floor apartment for a wine night with her friends and he showed up with Jaegerbombs. They stayed up drinking until 2am on a Thursday night and she said he seemed 'absolutely normal'. 'We drank with my friends we chatted for a while,' she said. Ms Wright, a tourist visiting from New Zealand, reportedly met Mr Tostee on the dating app Tinder while she was in the country for a friend's wedding . The 28-year-old told her he was a builder, that he had wealthy parents and that he was named after Clark Gable from Gone With The Wind. 'I wasn't threatened or worried, it's Tinder you don't know them from a bar of soap,' she added. However, Deb said she ensured she didn't put herself at risk. 'The number one rule is don't put yourself in a dangerous environment as they are always going to put their best foot forward. I made sure I wasn't alone in my apartment,' she explained. 'They are all good looking, cocky and arrogant, he was one of a million down on the Gold Coast.'","Gable Tostee says no recording devices have been seized by detectives .

Ms Wright smiling and posing a python just days before her death on the Gold Coast, where she had been enjoying a two week vacation, attending a wedding and meeting up with old friends, and meeting via dating app Tinder with Gable Tostee (above, right). Tostee is allegedly the holder of a bodybuilding.com account in the name of GT, who recently boasted in the online forum about his sex life . Posting a tribute to her friend, Ms Lesa said she would never forget the animal lover whose page was filled with photos of animals. 'It was just like a few days ago we were hanging out, taking selfies relaxing on the beach, visiting the tallest building in Australia, cruising around and talking about the good times we had together as buddy ol pals making the best of our time together,' Ms Lesa wrote. 'Though my heart aches for you and my mind is still adjusting to the fact you are gone I will always cherish the best moments I have had with you while you were here. 'I will never forget you my dearest friend who I love and keep close to my heart forever.' Ms Wright's mother, Beth Wright, who is a deacon of the Seventh Day Adventist Church in Wellington, is believed to have flown to the Gold Coast. Police are continuing their investigations into the circumstances surrounding Ms Wright’s death. Mr Tostee, a computer expert, contacted Queensland police at 11am on Friday and was questioned for more than two hours at the Surfers Paradise station, accompanied by his lawyer, but was released without charge according to The Courier Mail. It is believed Tostee - who was found guilty of supplying fake IDs to underage Schoolies with two of his friends which made them $30,000 eight years ago - had been drinking with Ms Wright. Police were almost immediately on scene when a man raised the alarm but on arrival nobody was inside the unit from which she had fallen. They are investigating if someone had been there but fled the scene when police came knocking. 'Voices were heard and noises were heard coming from the unit,' Regional Crime Coordinator Detective Superintendent David Hutchinson told media. 'But the investigation at the moment is in the evidence gathering and information gathering stage, so we have numerous detectives working on the case - we are gathering a lot of information and we are interviewing a lot of people,' he told Radio NZ. Following last weekend's interview with Mr Tostee, who is believed to have moved from the apartment to his parents' place, police seized CCTV footage from the apartment. 'Once we work our way through that process we'll sit down and determine the next direction for the investigation.' No charges in relation to the 26-year-old's death have been laid, but the 26-year-old's death is being treated as suspicious by police and are appealing to the public for information. Detectives want to speak to anybody who has been in contact with Ms Wright since she arrived or know of her activities in Australia.","Police seized CCTV footage from home of Gable Tostee's parents .

"By . Mail Online Reporter . Bristol Palin, 23, bought a five-bedroom Arizona home with all cash just four years ago, but now she can't make a dollar. The daughter of former Alaska governor and one-time Vice Presidential candidate Sarah Palin has filed paperwork to try and get child support payments dating back nearly two years from Levi Johnston, her former fiance and the father of her son Tripp, five. Bristol claims in the paperwork that her 2013 income was zero dollars, and so far in 2014 it's zero as well. Scroll down for video . Bristol Palin, pictured here with her son Tripp, is fighting to get more money from her ex-fiance Levi Johnston. In the court documents Bristol reported her 2013 income was zero and she has also earned nothing this year . The court documents, which were obtained by Radar, show Bristol is asking Levi for child support payments of $1,750 a month, and she wants the money dating back to October 2012. Since she shot to fame as the pregnant daughter of a Republican vice presidential ticket,  Palin has worked hard to cash in on her fame. She has had lucrative deals with Candies, penned a 2011 memoir (with some help) called Not Afraid of Life: My Journey So Far, appeared on Dancing with the Stars in 2010, Dancing with the Stars All Stars in 2012, and she had her own reality show Bristol Palin: Life's a Tripp which aired for one season on Lifetime in 2012 and was promptly cancelled. In December 2010 Bristol paid $172,000 cash for this five-bedroom Arizona home, pictured left, and she has twice appeared as a contestant on Dancing with the Stars. But now she makes nothing . In December 2010 she bought a home in Arizona, featured on her failed show, for $172,000 cash. She was the sole purchaser of the five-bedroom, two-and-a-half bath home which has a three-car garage. The same month she bought her home she bankrolled surgery on her jaw, which she insisted was more than just for her appearance as it helped align her teeth, too. While she has flamed out professional, it appears Levi has been making a regular income. After posing for Playgirl in 2009 and writing a tell-all a year later, Levi has gotten married, had a baby girl and gotten a job. Johnston made $62,400 in 2014 and $39,067.25 the year before, according to the paperwork. His wages are currently being garnished 40% as he works to pay his outstanding bills. Then: Bristol shot to fame in 2008 when she was pregnant and her mother was nominated for VP. Here she and then-fiance Levi hold hands to meet the world at the Republican National Convention in September 2008 . Now: Levi married Sunny in 2012. She is the mother of his second child, Breeze Beretta. Johnston has found employment and has already made  $62,000 this year. Their daughter's middle name is in honor of the gun . In an affidavit the 24-year-old said, who is fighting the payments, wrote, 'the amount is very taxing on my family.' Bristol has custody of Tripp, while Levi lives with wife Sunny and their daughter Breeze Beretta, who was born in September 2012 shortly before her parents married. Fortunately for Bristol her mother has made millions on books, speaking engagements and television appearances.","The eldest daughter of Sarah Palin reported her income was zero for 2013 and so far in 2014 .

Richard Murphy, of Tax Research UK, said he was shocked that the Prime Minister and the Chancellor had accepted the tax cuts – at a time when everyone is supposed ‘to be in it together’. He said: ‘It is surprising that in this time of austerity when everyone is meant to be in it together that they are willing to take tax cuts that are not available to anyone else.’ Treasury insiders said the cut came about when it was discovered the taxman had been applying tax rules in the wrong way. Mr Murphy said: ‘It’s a mistake by HMRC, but instead of pointing out their mistake they have just accepted it.’ Alex Hilton, director of Generation Rent which campaigns for private renters, said the government should be focusing on lowering the cost of renting for ordinary people. He said: ‘Britain’s renters are paying 40 per cent of their income on housing. If we are all in this together then the PM and the chancellor should help others to lower their housing costs.’ A spokesperson from the Treasury said Cameron and Osborne were being treated no differently to their predecessors. They said: ‘The Prime Minister and Chancellor pay tax on the benefit in kind of using the flat in Downing Street, and this is independently calculated by HMRC. This is exactly the same arrangement as previous Chancellors and Prime Ministers.’ Chancellor George Osborne will save £1,560 per annum thanks to a tax blunder which left him quids in .","PM David Cameron will save at least £1,228 a year in tax .

According to that data, the wealthiest tend to fall into three categories: Entrepreneurs, Heirs, and Widows. About half of those on the list are founders of their own companies. As The Huffington Post noticed, there can be huge gaps between fortunes. Billionaire investor Warren Buffet, the Oracle of Omaha, came in second place on the list . Bill Gates tops the list for richest man in Washington, along with the country and the world since the Microsoft founder's company netted him a whopping $76 billion net worth. Gate's inclusion highlights that academics may not always be as important as people think, as the computer innovator is a college dropout. Delaware's Robert Gore earned a Ph. D., but is second to last on the list for net worth. Rob Walton, Alice Walton, and Jim Walton, dominated three states with their inheritance from the Wal-Mart empire .

"By . Mail Online Reporter . A California woman who tried to kill her husband nearly three years ago has been sentenced to prison. Laura Jean Wenke wrapped herself in bubble wrap, donned a mechanic's jumpsuit and boots and then stabbed her husband Randy in September 2011 after first shooting him with a taser. Ms Wenke was said to be jealous her estranged husband had a new girlfriend, but she also was the beneficiary his $2 million life insurance policy. Lauren Wenke, pictured her in an arrest shot from 2011, was sentenced this week to eleven years to life in prison for the attempted murder of then-estranged husband Randy . She was convicted in June of attempted murder, assault with a deadly weapon, assault with a stun gun and domestic violence. Last year she pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity. During the trial her defense team argued that Ms Wenke suffered from mental illness and dissociative stress disorder that left her disconnected from her actions, reports the San Jose Mercury News. The jury didn't buy it. The couple had filed for divorce in August 2010 and the split was acrimonious. They were living apart but still working together at the time of the attack. Police in Los Altos, California, said she had carefully planned the attack on her husband as he sat working in his office. Her then 48-year-old husband was working at his computer at Wenke Construction in Redwood City when his wife attacked. Ms Wenke wrapped her body in bubble wrap, covered it up in a jumpsuit and boots, then stun gun and stabbed her husband in September 2011 while he sat working at the family construction business, pictured here . Ms Wenke shot a stun gun into her estranged husband's side, stabbed him in the neck from left to right and stabbed his chest while he was still sitting at his computer. He was able to call 911 and police officers found him outside the building, bleeding. His wife was still in his office, her bubble wrap outfit streaked with blood, when officers arrested her. The bubble wrap was believed to be protective in case her husband managed to turn the stun gun on his attacker. The couple has one son, who was just eight at the time of the attack. Ms Wenke will be eligible for parole in nine years.","Laura Wenke, now 53, attacked her husband in September 2011 .

"By . Associated  Press Reporter . The United States has declared that it is 'appalled' by Israel's 'disgraceful' attack on a United Nations school sheltering some 3,000 displaced people in southern Gaza. In language that was rare in its directness and severity, the U.S. denounced the attack earlier on Sunday, which killed 10 people and left another 35 wounded. The statement released by the U.S. State Department noted that the school had been designated a protected location. 'The coordinates of the school, like all UN facilities in Gaza, have been repeatedly communicated to the Israel Defense Forces,' State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said. 'We once again stress that Israel must do more to meet its own standards and avoid civilian casualties.' Scroll down for video . A Palestinian boy, wounded following an Israeli military strike, is treated at a hospital in the Gaza Strip, while at least 10 people were killed in a fresh strike on a UN school on Sunday . The State Department referred to the attack on the U.N. school as a 'shelling,' although U.N. and Palestinian officials in Gaza called it an airstrike. The U.S. condemnation follows one by U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, who depicted the attack near the Rafah school as both 'a moral outrage and a criminal act.' Earlier, a senior Palestinian diplomat expressed outrage over killings and bloodshed on both sides in Gaza and called for negotiations to end the savage fighting that has gone on for nearly a month. 'What we need now is to stop this fighting, to address the tragic humanitarian situation in the Gaza Strip,' Riyad Mansour, the Palestinian ambassador to the U.N., said on NBC's Meet the Press. Palestinian families take shelter at a United Nations (UN) school in central Gaza City which was attacked by Israeli forces on Sunday . He said putting the people of Gaza 'in a continuous situation of confrontation and fighting' will only lead to more violence, adding, 'This is an excellent atmosphere for radicalism.' 'But if you give them (Palestinians) hope, you open the borders, you let them go to school, let them look for good jobs, let them look for moderation,' Mansour said. 'And we will succeed in allowing all those who want to have peace... to have the upper hand.' Pierre Krahenbuhl, head of the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees, called the shelter attack a clear violation of international law. 'These are premises that are protected, the sanctity of which has to be respected by all parties,' he said Sunday on CBS' Face the Nation. About 1,800 Palestinians and 60 Israelis have been killed nearly a month into Israel's forceful assault on Hamas in the Gaza Strip.

He was a seven-time Pro Bowl selection and the . league's Defensive Player of the Year in 2001. Now known for his popularity on Live with Kelly and Michael the footballer brought some laughs to the proceedings as his co-host blew him a proud kiss from the stands.

With Kelly And Michael co-host Kelly Ripa cheered her partner on as he accepted his induction . Stahan gave his acceptance speech in his . new gold jacket complimented with a tie striped to match the Giants' red, white, and blue. Strahan, one of the game's most dominant pass-rushers, closed the ceremony that ended just before midnight - nearly two hours later than scheduled. The defensive end cracked he was still a little scared of former New York Giants teammate Lawrence Taylor. Strahan singled out former Philadelphia tackle Jon Runyan in the crowd and referred to him as his toughest opponent and '350 pounds of twisted steel and non-sex appeal.' The ceremony went so late that Strahan noted that it was past his bedtime and joked that if the event lasted any longer he and his fellow inductees would be considered the 2015 class. Strahan joked he was once chubby 13-year-old working out to Jane Fonda tapes. 'My life is improbable,' Strahan said. 'I am an absolutely . improbable Hall of Famer. I'm an improbable football player.' 'My life is improbable,' Strahan saidn during his induction. 'I am an absolutely improbable Hall of Famer. I'm an improbable football player.' Having once lived in Mannheim, Germany, he called New York the 'scariest city' he'd ever been to. 'My hope for my kids is that I showed . you that improbability means absolutely nothing because anything is . possible,' he said. His 141 1/2 career sacks rank fifth on the NFL list. He retired following the 2007 season, after helping the Giants win the Super Bowl. Strahan closed the induction ceremony by being introduced by TV broadcaster Jay Glazer.

Strahan was a seven-time Pro Bowl selection and the league's Defensive Player of the Year in 2001, and had 22 1/2 sacks in 2001 to set the NFL single-season record . Turning his back to the crowd, Reed caught a pass from Kelly before sharing a lengthy hug with his former teammate and now fellow Hall of Famer. It was a fitting finish for a tandem that set a then-NFL record by hooking up 663 times in Buffalo. And it was a moment that paid homage to the quarterback, who has spent the past 14 months battling cancer. 'You taught us not to quit,' Reed said about Kelly. 'You have endured a lot in your life. The loss of your son, and most recently your battle with cancer. You're an inspiration to all you touch.' Kelly was near tears, and the thousands of Bills fans in the crowd cheered. Even louder cheers went up when Reed delivered a message to any Bills prospective ownership group having an intention of buying and relocating the franchise. 'Oh yeah, and the Bills will stay in Buffalo, too,' Reed said. The Bills are on the block after founder and Hall of Fame owner Ralph Wilson died in March.","Strahan .

"By . Nick Enoch . Star trails sweep over the Giant’s Causeway in Northern Ireland, dust clouds are moulded into colossal arrangements by cosmic radiation thousands of light years away and a bright meteor races across the night sky passing over Indonesia’s smoke-spewing Mount Bromo. These are just some of the incredible photos which have been shortlisted in the 2014 Astronomy Photographer of the Year competition. The contest, run by the Royal Observatory Greenwich in association with BBC Sky at Night Magazine, is now in its sixth year - and a record number of entries from more than 2,500 enthusiastic amateurs and professional photographers have poured in from around the world. Centre of the Heart Nebula by Ivan Eder, Hungary. Situated 7,500 light years away in the W-shaped constellation of Cassiopeia, the Heart Nebula is a vast region of glowing gas, energised by a cluster of young stars at its centre. The image depicts the central region, where dust clouds are being eroded and moulded into rugged shapes by the searing cosmic radiation . What the...! by Tommy Richardsen, Norway. A flamboyant flare-up of the aurora over Steinsvik beach, in Nordreisa, Troms, Norway. It lasted no more than ten minutes from start to finish but it lit up the entire sky and took the photographer by surprise, just as he was about to leave the shoot. The figure on the right is his brother, furiously searching for his lens cap to capture the same phenomenon. It was hard for the photographer not to laugh at his brother while moving the camera left to right capturing the panorama, but luckily he stood still long enough to make the final capture . Father and Son Observe Comet PanSTARRS by Chris Cook, USA. They saw the evening display on First Encounter Beach, Eastham, Massachusetts. The photographer had spent weeks preparing the shoot to capture the comet, which will not be seen again for over 100,000 years, in order to foster his son's interest in astronomy . Eclipse and Old Faithful (left) by Robert Howell, USA. Visitors witness the Old Faithful geyser in Yellowstone National Park erupt as the moon partially eclipses the sun. The scene captures a sense of awe set against blue sky and white geyser steam, as the onlookers strain to see the joining of these two phenomena - one geological and one astronomical. Right,  A Giant's Star Trail by Rob Oliver, UK. A composition of several images taken at the famed Giant's Causeway in Northern Ireland. Our planet's rotation draws the stars out into circles - considered to be the most perfect shape by ancient philosophers . Occultation of Jupiter by Sebastián Guillermaz, Argentina. An unusual daytime view of an astronomical alignment, captured from the photographer's backyard in Los Polvorines, Buenos Aires. The image shows the moments just before the planet Jupiter is blocked from view by the moon. The planet can be seen as a pale dot to the right of the moon's body . Cave With Aurora Skylight by Ingólfur Bjargmundsson, Iceland. This image was taken while exploring a 1,300m lava cave in Iceland. In some areas, the roof has caved in, so snow piles up in the winter time and creates these snow peaks. The aurora at its peak gleams through the roof of the cave and despite only taking up a small portion of the photo, it remains the focal point . Shortlisted entries - of which there are more than 120 - include the magnificent pageantry of aurora dancing above the clouds taken from the window of a transatlantic flight between London and New York and the remarkable scene of the Milky Way reflected in the Snake River at the famous Oxbow Bend of Grand Teton National Park in Wyoming. Another image shows a crowd of awestruck onlookers taking in the spectacular solar eclipse gleaming through the steam as the Old Faithful Geyser erupts in Yellowstone National Park. And the variety of settings is not limited to our planet. Photographers have also captured sights from across our Solar System, galaxy and even further afield. Eta Aquarid Meteor Shower over Mount Bromo by Justin Ng, Singapore. A bright meteor streaks across the magnificent night sky over the smoke-spewing Mount Bromo just one day before the peak of the Eta Aquarid meteor shower, which is caused by Halley's Comet. Mount Bromo is one of the most well-known active volcanoes in East Java, Indonesia. Also seen in the photograph are the highest active volcano, Mount Semeru (3,676m), and the extinct volcano, Mount Batok, which is located to the right of Mount Bromo . Orion Nebula by Anna Morris, USA. In this view of M42, more commonly known as the Orion Nebula, the photographer has emphasised the delicate veils of dust surrounding the more familiar gleaming heart of the nebula. The image highlights the structure of the object, giving a sense of vast cavities filled with pink hydrogen gas and the blue haze of reflected starlight . In-flight Entertainment by Paul Williams, UK. Resplendent aurora seen from the window of a transatlantic flight between London and New York in February 2014. The photographer balanced his camera on his backpack to capture this image of the greatest natural light show on earth from a rare perspective . The Turbulent Heart of the Scorpion by Rolf Wahl Olsen, New Zealand. A spectacular display of light and shade with contrasting hues of the rarely imaged, colourful, action-packed core of the multiple star system, Rho Ophiuchi. A deep exposure showcases the full finery of the delicate whirling clouds, of an area in which the human eye would struggle to see much detail, even with the use of a telescope . Three Planets in Conjunction by Lóránd Fényes, Hungary. The staggering colours of the sunset and flora of the African savannah afford a unique background for the planetary alignment of Jupiter, Venus and Mercury in June 2013. The golden hues of the sunrise, the three planets appeared as if they were strung on an invisible thread, and the bare tree and the human figure interwoven both point to one direction: Jupiter . Celestial Dance by Claus Possberg, Germany. The spectacular Northern Lights pictured unfolding over a fjord, in Skjervøy, Troms, Norway. The vibrant colours are produced at various altitudes by different atmospheric gases, with blue light emitted by nitrogen and green by oxygen. Red light can be produced by both gases, while purples, pinks and yellows occur where the various colours mix and intersect . Geminid Fireball by Patrick Cullis, USA. The Geminid meteor shower races over the Flatirons of Boulder, Colorado, in December 2012. Here, a larger than usual fragment burns bright enough to outshine all of the planets, producing what is commonly called a Fireball. Orion can also be seen in the photograph trailing across the sky toward the Pleiades and the glow of Jupiter inside the constellation of Taurus . The photos include a rare daytime scene of Jupiter moments before its astronomical alignment behind the body of the moon; the searing heat of the Crescent Nebula glowing in a whirl of red and blue; and the sprawling stellar nursery of the Orion Nebula 1,350 light years away and home to stars at diverse stages of their lives. The competition’s judges include space scientist and TV presenter Dr Maggie Aderin-Pocock, Editor of Sky at Night Magazine Chris Bramley and the Royal Observatory’s Public Astronomer Dr Marek Kukula. The winners of the four categories and three special prizes will be announced on September 17 and an exhibition of the winning images opens the following day at the Royal Observatory. The exhibition is free of charge and runs until February 2015. Winners and shortlisted entries will also be published in the competition’s official book, available on September 18 from bookstores and online.

Multiple shots have been used to produce a time-lapse effect, as the Earth's rotation draws the light from the stars into long trails arcing over the beach in Mar de Ajo, Buenos Aires Province . Creature by Ole Christian Salomonsen, Norway. On October 30, a CME (Coronal Mass Ejection) hit Earth, displaying multi-coloured auroras across the sky for most of the night in Kattfjordeidet, Tromsø. The old birch trees resemble arms reaching for the auroral corona appearing like a strange creature in the sky . NGC 6888 by Mark Hanson, USA. This colourful starscape taken from Rancho Hidalgo, New Mexico, reveals the searing heat of the Crescent Nebula glowing in a whirl of red and blue. The emission nebula is a colossal shell of material ejected from a powerful but short-lived Wolf-Rayet star (WR 136), seen close to the image centre.

"By . Josh Gardner For Mailonline . Was it personal? Jonathan Saenz, while always a devout Catholic and conservative activist, did not become head of Texas's largest anti-gay group until after his wife left him for a woman . The leader of one of the largest and most vocal anti-gay groups in Texas took the group's helm soon after his wife of 9 years left him for a woman, court documents reveal. Already a conservative firebrand attorney, Jonathan Saenz became head of Texas Values in early 2012. His wife Corinne and mother of his three young children filed for divorce in August of 2012, reports Lone Star Q. According to divorce filings, what followed were two years of bitter legal feuding, much of which was focused on Corinne's girlfriend Ercimin Paredes and Saenz children. During the prolonged battle, Jonathan Saenz sought to bar Paredes or any other future romantic partner of his wife's from ever having any contact or even being in the same building as his children. The request was granted temporarily but was absent from the final divorce agreement, which would not be made until August 2013--nearly two years to the day after Corinne first filed. Mr. Saez claimed that his wife and Paredes, her fellow teacher at Becker Elementary School in the Austin Independent School District, began a serious relationship 'as early as the fall of 2010.' The Saenz children now split their time between parents. Another sticking point came when Mr. Saenz demanded that both he and Corinne undergo a psychological evaluation with a psychologist of his choosing as part of the proceedings. Corinne initially agreed until it was . revealed that her husband's chosen evaluator charged an 'exorbitant' $2,500. Saez refused to pay for his wife's evaluation and the . stipulation they use the psychologist was dropped. Divorce papers indicate Jonathan Saenz's wife Corinne (right) filed for divorce in late 2011. Much of the ensuing two year battle surrounded Corinne's girlfriend Ercimin Paredes (left) Strong views: In addition to his strong support of the Boy Scouts ban on gays, Saenz has said opening he believes gay marriage will lead to people marrying their own stepchildren and that gay rights activists want to create Christian concentration camps . While the results of the evaluation are not revealed in court documents, it's Mr. Saez who the suit suggests has a history of treatment for mental illness. Lone Star Q reports: . 'Jonathan Saenz sought to compel his ex-wife to produce all records in her possession “pertaining to the psychiatric, psychological, counseling or other mental health treatments of Jonathan Saenz, including but not limited to any documents relating to any consultations or treatments during their marriage.""' Meanwhile, Saenz and Texas Value have suported the notion that homosexuality is a mental illness by endorsing gay conversion therapy. Saenz has also been open about his beliefs that same-sex marriage will lead not just to polygamy but also to people marrying their own stepchildren. Most recently, he and Texas Values have called for the state supreme court to overturn a decision to strike down a gay marriege ban.","Divorce papers indicate Jonathan Saenz's wife Corinne filed for divorce in late 2011 - Saenz took over Texas Values in early 2012 .

"By . John Hall . A Hawaii fish collector has been charged with 'terroristic threatening' for cutting off the air-supply regulator of a scuba-diving animal rights activist while they were both underwater. Prosecutors filed the misdemeanor charge against Jay Lovell yesterday following an incident off the coast of west Hawaii in May. Lovell is accused of pulling the air-supply regulator out the mouth of anti-aquarium-industry activist Renee Umberger when she and other divers approached while Lovell was collecting live fish to sell. Scroll down for video . Seconds before the crime: Video of the incident shows a diver (rear) quickly swim behind Umberger (front) and rip out her oxygen line. She eventually got it back in again, but then he came back for more . 'It's an appropriate charge,' 53-yer-old Umberger said on Wednesday after learning the complaint had been filed. She said people have approached her since the incident to talk about their concerns about the fish collecting practice. 'People have expressed gratitude for documenting this,' Umberger said. Victim: Rene Umberger claims it was only her vast diving experience that stopped her being killed . At the time of the incident Umberger said she had taken more than 10,000 dives in her life, and that it was only that experience that stopped her being killed.

She eventually got it back in again, but then he came back for more. ‘I honestly thought he was coming back for a second attack,’ said Umberger. ‘I got up on the boat and I said oh my God, someone just tried to kill me underwater.’ Lovell's brother, Jim Lovell, said the divers were disrupting the fish collectors' work. 'It is very clear that Rene Umberger and her associates were responsible for this incident,' Jim Lovell said in an email to West Hawaii Today. Lovell filed a complaint against Umberger for the episode. Fishermen off the Kona coast, where the confrontation occurred, account for 75 percent of the aquarium fish caught in Hawaii. Aquarium fish collecting is legal off Kona, but fisherman must avoid certain places and collect only certain species. The incident occurred in Keawaiki Bay, where collecting is allowed.

"By . John Hall . A man has admitted killing two young girls in a random street shooting in 2008, as well as murdering his fiance three years later. Kevin Sweat, 28, killed 13-year-old Taylor Paschal-Placker and 11-year-old Skyla Whitaker near the town of Weleetka in rural Oklahoma - but investigators had no idea he was involved at the time. It wasn't until police questioned him years over the brutal 2011 murder of his 23-year-old fiance Ashley Taylor, that officers were able to link the crimes. Yesterday Sweat entered guilty to all three first-degree murders after prosecutors dropped plans to seek the death penalty in return for the killer agreeing to waive his right to a jury trial. Guilty: Kevin Sweat, 28, has admitted shooting dead 13-year-old Taylor Paschal-Placker and 11-year-old Skyla Whitaker in rural Oklahoma road in 2008, and also slitting his fiance Ashley Taylor's her throat three years later . Prosecutors said Sweat told an investigator during a videotaped interview that he shot the two girls because he thought they were 'monsters' coming at him. Sweat was barely audible at yesterday's hearing as he responded to questions from the judge, who read a statement he signed acknowledging that the statements he made during the taped interview were accurate. 'We're finally going to get this off of our shoulders,' said his late fiance's mother, Faye Taylor. Ashley's father, Michael Taylor, added that the acknowledgement of guilt was 'a big part of the healing process,' adding: 'It's a big relief knowing this is happening. You doubt it's ever going to happen.' Peter Placker, the grandfather of Taylor Paschal-Placker, said he 'finally knows for sure' that Sweat was responsible for the deaths. But he noted: 'It's not over until he's sentenced.' Prosecutors said Sweat told an investigator during a videotaped interview that he shot the 13-year-old Taylor Paschal-Placker (left) and 11-year-old Skyla Whitaker (right) because he thought they were 'monsters' Kevin Sweat pictured shortly after his 2011 arrest. A sentencing hearing has not been set, but Sweat faces life without prison, either with or without parole after pleading guilty to the three murders . A sentencing hearing has not been set, but Sweat faces life without prison, either with or without parole. Sweat's attorneys had argued that Sweat was not mentally competent when he waived his Miranda rights before participating in the videotaped interview. But a judge agreed this year to allow prosecutors to use the video as evidence. The video had been played at previous hearings. In the video, Sweat first tells Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation agent Kurt Titsworth he had nothing to do with the girls' deaths, saying ""there would be no point to shooting kids."" But Sweat eventually said he shot what he said were ""the demons"" who approached him along a rural road where the girls' bullet-riddled bodies were found. ""I see demons, vampires ... monsters, demons, whatever. I do have some problems,"" Sweat said. ""I was scared. ... They were still coming at me, so I shot them."" Taylor, his fianceé, went missing in July 2011 after telling her parents she was eloping with Sweat. Investigators have said that Sweat claimed he and Taylor argued and she got out of the car after the pair left Okmulgee to be married. The cases were ultimately connected after officers investigating her death found shell casings on Sweat's father's property that had markings that matched those found at the scene of the girls' 2008 slayings.

"By . John Hall . A family who claim their five-year-old son developed facial paralysis after doctors dropped him seconds after birth are attempting to raise money for surgery that will allow him to smile. Maddox Perales, from Marietta in Georgia, suffers from Moebius Syndrome - an extremely rare form of facial paralysis that is caused either by a genetic defect or direct trauma. Now that Maddox is preparing to start school, his parents Charlie Perales and Danielle Templer are keen to ensure their otherwise hugely sociable son is able to make friends, so they are hoping to raise $100,000 to pay for him to have facial reanimation surgery. Unable to smile: Maddox Perales, from Marietta in Georgia, suffers from Moebius Syndrome - an extremely rare form of facial paralysis that affects just one in a million babies . Adorable: Instead of expressing emotion using his facial muscles, Maddox uses his hands to force his mouth into a smile - a heartbreaking move that is making his parents concerned about making friends at school . Mr Perales, a military veteran who has served twice in Iraq and once in Afghanistan, says his son was born perfectly healthy but was dropped by a doctor just minutes later. This, he claims, is what led to Maddox developing Moebius Syndrome - a highly unusual form of facial paralysis that affects one in a million children and is caused either by genetics or injury. 'I've been through a lot in the military... It was a lot different feeling when you see your son falling, Mr Perales told USA Today. '[The doctor] told us pretty much that he'd never be able to smile,' Ms Templer added. 'He would never be able to frown, and he wouldn't blink. I remember my therapist saying, 'Don't treat him like he's different.' So I treat him like there's nothing wrong,' she said. Cause: Maddox's father says his son was born perfectly healthy but was dropped by a doctor just minutes later. This, he claims, is what led to Maddox developing Moebius Syndrome . For the most part the disorder does not impact of Maddox's life and he is a hugely bubbly character - happily chatting to his parents, rarely sitting still and always keen to re-watch the DVD of his favourite animated film, Frozen. It is only when Maddox wants to express joy that it becomes obvious he is not like other young boys. Instead of expressing emotion using his facial muscles, Maddox uses his hands to force his mouth into a smile - a heartbreaking move that is making his parents concerned for his immediate future. Later this year Maddox will start school, where he will need to make friends by himself - something his mother and father are worried he will struggle to do with a face unable to convey friendliness. Normal boy: For the most part the disorder does not impact of Maddox's life and he is a hugely bubbly character - happily chatting to his parents and younger brother and always keen to re-watch his favourite film, Frozen . As a result, Mr Perales and Ms Templer have set up a GoFundMe page in the hope of raising $100,000 for Maddox to have facial reanimation surgery. The operation will repair damage to the boy's facial muscles and nerves and will eventually give him his smile back, Ms Templer says. 'Everyone deserves a smile and so I won't stop until my son has a smile on his face too,' she added. 'It's not the desire to make him smile,' Maddox's father said. 'Smiling is just something we do on the outside. It's the desire for him to be happy.'","Maddox Perales, five, suffers from an extremely rare form of facial paralysis .

"By . John Hall . Correction officers at the notoriously violent Rikers Island jail in New York have been charged with smuggling drugs into the prison over a six month period. Seven officers have been accused of sneaking cocaine and oxycodone into the island jail, charging inmates between $400 and $900 per package. Two of the accused officers were recorded by an undercover Drug Enforcement Agency worker boasting about the alleged scheme and offering to use their 'badge and gun' to protect dealers. Accused: Divine Rahming (left), Steven Dominguez (centre) and Deleon Gifth (right) are three of the seven Rikers Island correction officers charged with offences related to drug smuggling at the notorious prison . The smuggling suspects were allegedly recorded discussing drug deals during an ongoing probe at Rikers Island by New York's Department of Investigation and several other law enforcement agencies. Prosecutors say Steven Dominguez and Divine Rahming told an undercover Drug Enforcement Agency worker that they had been smuggling cocaine and oxycodone into the jail for five months. They are also accused of offering to use their 'badge and gun' as protection for drug dealers outside the prison, according to the New York Daily News. The DEA agent is understood to have been posing as a relative of a prison inmate when the men allegedly boasted of their drug smuggling activities. 'By smuggling drugs into Rikers Island, . these corrections officers jeopardized the safety of the city’s jails . and sold their honor as officers of the law,' said DOI Commissioner Mark . Peters, who led the investigation alongside Special Narcotics Prosecutor Bridget Brennan.

Two months later Gifth resigned from his post and he was charged with the alleged crime this week. Another four unnamed officers face either demotion or the sack for their alleged role in the process. These charges stem from either conversations the men had which suggest they knew of illegal activity taking place inside Rikers Island, or allegations their behaviour in the prison knowingly allowed drug dealing to take place. In total the investigation has seen 12 correction officers charged with criminal offences - many of them described as 'ethical lapses', such as beating prisoners and covering up evidence.","Seven officers have been charged with smuggling offences at Rikers Island .

"By . John Hall . Google is to meet data regulators across the European Union to discuss the way it handled the EU's 'right to be forgotten ruling'. In May the European Court of Justice ruled that links to 'irrelevant' or outdated articles should be erased from search engine results if those mentioned in the articles request their removal. That verdict, along with Google's decision to apply the practice only to its European search engines, has pitted privacy advocates against freedom of speech defenders, who argue the process will be abused in order to cover up information that should remain easily accessible to the public. Debate: Regulators can take Google to court if it refuses to delete articles they consider 'irrelevant' or outdated, as happened in Spain where the 'right to be forgotten' ruling originated . European . data protection authorities are meeting representatives of Google, . Microsoft and Yahoo to discuss the implementation of the landmark . ruling. European . Union privacy watchdogs have reportedly raised a number of concerns . about the way the ruling is being implemented, particularly by Google. Regulators . can take Google to court if it refuses to meet their demands, as . happened in Spain where the 'right to be forgotten' ruling originated. Under . particular scrutiny is Google's decision to only remove results from . its European search engines - such as Google.co.uk - meaning anyone can . easily access the hidden information by switching to the widely used Google.com. Experts . have said this effectively defeats the purpose of the ruling, which . gives people the right to ask search engines to stop links to . information deemed 'inadequate, irrelevant or no longer relevant, or . excessive' from appearing in searches for their name. 'Google has claimed that the decision is restricted to localised versions of Google...There appears to be no basis for that claim at all' said Ashley Hurst, a partner at Olswang, a law firm. Google declined to comment ahead of today's meeting. Browsing: Freedom of speech defenders argue 'right to be forgotten' will be abused in order to cover up information about individuals that should remain easily accessible to the public via search engines . Another . issue likely to be raised by the EU watchdogs is Google's decision to . notify the owners of the websites that have been removed from search . results. This sparked . controversy three weeks ago when Europe's most popular search engine . removed links to an article by a well-known BBC journalist about an . ex-Wall Street banker, and several links to stories in a UK newspaper. The . authors of the stories wrote about the removal, thereby . drawing attention to the issue and feeding speculation about who . requested the removal. Google eventually reinstated a few of the links. EU privacy watchdogs are concerned about the effect the notification process could have on people making the requests. Google already notifies the owners of websites that are removed from search results due to copyright infringements. Privacy . advocates and legal experts said the backlash over the aforementioned . articles showed the difficulty of implementing the privacy ruling given . the broad criteria laid down by the court for information that is . inadequate or irrelevant. 'We . are likely to see complainants dressing up libel complaints as data . protection complaints as it is easier to prove that data is inaccurate . than it is to prove that it is libelous,' Hurst said. 'This will lead to some difficult decisions for Google,' he added.","Google has been accused of mishandling European Court of Justice ruling .

"By . John Hall . Residents of a New York neighbourhood have expressed their outrage after a grandfather abandoned his three young grandsons inside a burning apartment building. Willy Wilcox, 66, is believed to have fled the fire wearing only a T-shirt and boxer shorts, leaving behind his three terrified grandchildren - Darian, eight, Tremaine, five, and Trevele, four. Thankfully brave firefighters - including one rookie with just two months experience - were able to fight through the flames and save the young boys - but not young Trevele had passed out due to smoke inhalation. Scroll down for video . Scene: Willy Wilcox is believed to have fled the burning apartment building (pictured), leaving behind his three terrified grandchildren - Darian, eight, Tremaine, five, and Trevele, four . Hero: Former army medic Justin Tallett, 27, had only been a firefighter for two months when he ventured inside the smoke-filled apartment and rescued unconscious and critically injured four-year-old Travele Belton . Due to the brave work of the fire crews, all three boys are expected to make a full recovery, although Trevelle had been in a critical condition and needed to be resuscitated on his way to hospital. Now attention is turning to the cause of the fire and why Mr Wilcox was able to leave the property totally unharmed, but his young grandsons almost lost their lives. Residents living on Brooklyn's Loring Avenue are furious about the incident, with one local - 33-year-old Omar White - quoted by the New York Daily News as saying: 'People here want to hurt him...They were like, ""How could you leave those kids in the house?"".' Firefighters arriving at the scene at around 11am yesterday morning were themselves surprised to find Mr Wilcox standing casually in the lobby while his grandchildren were trapped upstairs. He reportedly told fire crews that he left his apartment's front door open for the boys to get out. Lucky escape: Travelle's two older brothers were still conscious and had already been plucked from a broken fourth floor window (pictured) by fire teams using a bucket ladder on the outside of the building . The young boys' aunt Amanda Ridley, 51, said she had 'no idea' why Mr Wilcox had abandoned them, adding: 'I wouldn’t be surprised if he was drunk and sleeping because I do know him to drink...I don’t think he’s capable of taking care of kids.' Speaking to the newspaper at Brookdale Hospital, where the boys are being treated, Ms Ridley said she thought the blaze started by accident when four-year-old Trevele lit something on the stove. A formal investigation into the fire is now underway, with police understood to be looking into the line that burns on Trevele's body suggest he was somehow responsible. Among the firefighters from Ladder 107 who attended the scene was 27-year-old Justin Tallett - a former army medic who has only been in the job for two months.

The annual Festa dei Gigli, or Festival of Lilies, attracts thousands of visitors - many of whom come purely to watch local men carry eight 82 foot structures weighing 2,000lbs around the town.

Scroll down for video . Painful: Although deforming yourself in the name of religion may seem odd, the Festival of Lilies has been taking place in Nola, near Naples in southern Italy, for more than 1,500 years . Strong: The 120 local men who take part in the annual parade are known cullatori - which means 'cradlers' Struggle: To make matters worse, local children and musicians climb on top of the handcrafted platforms as they are transported through the narrow back streets to Piazza del Duomo in the centre of Nola .

The Festival of Lilies is dedicated to Saint Paulinus, who tradition states gave up his freedom and all his possessions to save the citizens of Nola during the Visigoth invasion of 410AD. A festival celebrating Saint Paulinus' sacrifice is believed to have been held the same year, and proved so popular that it has continued for each of the subsequent 1,604 years. This year the Festival of Lilies was finally given UNESCO protection status - meaning organisers now receive a small amount of money from the UN every year to ensure the tradition never dies out. Pride: The huge effort leaves those taking part in the ceremony with horrific calluses on their shoulders. But far from hiding them away, the men show off their injuries as a symbol of their sacrifice and religious devotion . Motivation: Known as gigli - or lilies - the giant structures are carried to the sound of both religious music and traditional Neapolitan folk songs .

The huge wooden structures the men carry as they take part in the parade each weigh 2,000lbs and are 82 foot long. Known as gigli - or lilies - the giant structures are carried to the sound of both religious music and traditional Neapolitan folk songs. To make matters worse, locals children and musicians climb on top of them as the handcrafted platforms are transported through the narrow back streets to Piazza del Duomo in the centre of Nola. Esteemed photographer Antonio Busiello captured the striking images of the cullatori - with one of his images winning the gold medal for the Royal Photographic Society Print Exhibition in 2013. Chair of the selectors Ray Spence said the image raises 'valid and contemporary questions about body image'.

Devotion: Antonio Busiello says he is proud to have taken his award-winning photographs and says he admires the cullatori's lack of vanity . Build: The huge wooden structures each weigh a staggering 2,000lbs and are 82 foot long . Major event: Teams of experts take several weeks to build the massive wooden structures every year . Status: This year the Festival of Lilies was finally given UNESCO protection - meaning organisers now receive a small amount of money from the UN every year to ensure the tradition never dies out . Parade: Although the ceremony celebrates the cullatori's strength and endurance, locals are eager not to forget that the Festival of Lilies is primarily a religious event, dedicated to the patron saint of the town . Busiello says he is proud to have taken the award-winning images of the cullatori, and says he admires their lack of vanity. In an age where so many many of us are obsessed with looks and perfecting ourselves, the cullatori are happy to deform themselves for the sake of religion and tradition, he says. 'I was impressed by how proudly, despite . the beauty standards of our time, they wear their huge calluses as . symbols of their sacrifice and devotion to Saint Paulinus,' Busiello added. The Festival of Lilies always starts on the last Sunday before June 22nd and lasts seven days. Unlike many religious celebrations held in rural Italy, the tradition shows no sign of dying out. Along with the new financial backing from UNESCO, record-breaking numbers of young locals apply to become one of the 120 cullatori each year.","Festival of Lilies sees men carry huge wooden structures on their shoulders .

"By . MailOnline Reporter . A New Jersey man who sparked controversy among his neighbors for flying a flag that is now associated with the jihadist group Islamic State says the whole thing has been a big misunderstanding. Mark Dunaway, of Garwood, says he's been flying the flag most Fridays and during the holy month of Ramadan for 10 years, since long before ISIS militants adopted the symbol as their own. For Dunaway, the flag — which says in Arabic, 'There is only one god, Allah, and the prophet Muhammad is his messenger' — is just a symbol of his faith. 'Every Muslim uses that black flag,' Dunway, 44, told NJ.com. 'You'll find it in any mosque in world. 'I am an American citizen and I love my country,  but I am also a Muslim and I use that flag to say I’m a Muslim.' Mr Dunaway has been flying this flag outside his Garwood, New Jersey, home for years. His neighbors recently noticed it and thought Dunaway was supporting ISIS jihadists . Kashmiri demonstrators hold up a flag of the Islamic State during a demonstration against Israeli military operations in Gaza. Although the group adopted the flag, it has long been a symbol of Islam and is was not historically associated with terrorist groups . The controversy began on Tuesday when investment manager Marc Leibowitz tweeted a photo of the flag and commented: 'Scary!' 'Jihadists are now in Garwood,' wrote one commenter on the photo. 'I think it's not right at this time to be flying that type of flag,' local resident James McHugh told News 12. 'Especially with what's going on at this time.' Neighbor Diana Figueiredo says Dunaway and his flag are harmless — but she does worry about the people making a stink out of the situation. 'He goes to work every day, he never bothers anyone, he keeps to . himself,' she told NJ.com. 'I'm more . concerned about the crazy people saying they're going to retaliate and . set his house on fire,' she added. 'They're the extremists.' Dunaway has since voluntarily removed his flag. 'If people are that offended by it, it is censorship,"" he told News 12. 'But I might not have to fly it for a while. Maybe one day I'll be able to fly it again.'","The flag's owner, Mark Dunaway, says that he has been flying this flag for 10 years, long before Islamic State militants adopted it .

"By . John Hall . A Mexican police officer who went on a brutal endangered wildlife hunting spree using a gun provided by his employer has been forced to resign. Sickening images of Wilfer Geovany Contreras Rosado, 38, posing in his police uniform with the bloodied corpses of rare deer, falcons and crocodiles went viral after being posted online last week. Rosado, who lives and works in the southern Mexican state of Campeche, had reportedly boasted to friends about the number of endangered animals he had slaughtered during his hunting trip. Sickening: Images of Wilfer Geovany Contreras Rosado, 38, posing in his police uniform with the bloodied corpses of rare falcons (left) and Morelet's crocodiles went viral after being posted online last week . Rosado was forced to resign from the Campeche police force after images of his hunting trip were posted on Facebook. Police . chiefs claim that as he no longer works as a . police officer, the matter has been dealt with. However . critics including environmental activists say that the police force has . to take responsibility for the fact that he used his police weapon and . ammunition to kill the animals. The images that were shared online showed a dead white tailed deer, several Morelet's crocodiles and a bird of prey. All of the animals Rosado is believed to have killed are not allowed to be hunted under Mexican law. Hunt: Images posted on Facebook showed the Mexican police officer posing with several endangered animals he had killed, including this haunting image of his boot on the neck of a dead white tailed deer .

The Mexican Federal Attorney for . Environmental Protection (Profepa) has confirmed that an investigation . is undergoing on charges of violating the Federal Law on Environmental . Protectio. It said the case was being built solely around the images posted on social media, all of which have now been deleted from the original source. Victor Perez Aguilar, the deputy director of the state police in the area where the officer worked, said that the fact Rosado had resigned meant that they would not be investigating the matter themselves. 'He resigned voluntary from the police . force, but this does not mean the officer does not escape responsibility . and he will have to face the consequences of the investigation by the . environmental protection office,' he said. The Profeoa investigation is likely to continue for several days before any formal charges are made.","Wilfer Geovany Contreras Rosado killed rare animals wearing his uniform .

"By . Louise Cheer For Daily Mail Australia . The mental state that contributed to Khaled Sharrouf turning into an Islamic extremist was left untreated for most of his stint in prison for terrorist activities and this only escalated his condition, according to his former psychiatrist. Sharrouf is wanted by the Australian Federal Police for alleged terrorist activities in the Middle East after he fled the country in December on his brother's passport. An oversight by the then-Department of Corrective Services meant the 33-year-old father-of-five, from Punchbowl, did not receive any treatment for his mental health issues until mid-2008, just months before he was released from jail in 2009, according to The Sydney Morning Herald. Scroll down for video . Khaled Sharrouf's mental condition was left untreated during his four-year stint in prison . A judge said his mental state contributed to him turning into an Islamic extremist . Sharrouf was jailed in 2005 and spent time at Goulburn and Lithgow prisons for his part in Operation Pendennis - a terrorist cell that operated in Melbourne and Sydney and was planning an Australian attack. In 2005, psychiatrist Olav Nielssen - a renowned psychiatrist who sits on the NSW Mental Health Review Tribunal - assessed Sharrouf's condition and discovered the jihadist had depression, acute schizophrenia, paranoia and had suffered from hallucinations for a number of years, with signs of mental illness showing as early as the 1990s. This emerges after Sharrouf recently shared a photo of his young son, believed to be seven years old, holding up a severed head on social media, which attracted widespread condemnation. A judge residing over Sharrouf's case had said his mental issues had driven him to jihad. It was heard in court his mental issues had 'predicated him towards extremism and radicalisation by others', The Sydney Morning Herald reported. The picture of Sharrouf's son caused widespread outrage, attracting comments from Tony Abbott to U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry . But leaving him 'languishing' without treatment for all those years had done him more harm, Dr Nielssen said. 'There was ample documented evidence of pre-existing mental illness that would have been exacerbated by a lack of treatment when incarcerated,' he said. In 2009, Justice Anthony Whealy said corrective services were too slow in responding and only reacted after 'a good deal of prompting'. But when treatment started for Sharrouf he did recover for a bit but reverted back to his old ways when he stopped taking medication and returned to seeking out other Islamic extremists. The latest controversy Sharrouf has stirred up involves a photo posted on Twitter last week of his son holding up a severed head, along with a caption: 'Thats my boy!' It was accompanied by a photo of Sharrouf himself holding the same head, written with the words: 'What a head', and another of him and three young boys brandishing rifles. The photos caused widespread condemnations from Tony Abbott (left) and U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry (right) The photos sparked worldwide condemnations from Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott and U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry. Tony Abbott said photographs such as this one highlighted the 'barbaric' nature of IS, which he said was trying to establish a 'terrorist state' in Iraq. 'I believe there are more photographs in the newspapers in Australia today of the kind of hideous atrocities this group is capable of,' he said. Mr Kerry echoed Mr Abbott's comments, saying: 'This image, perhaps even an iconic photograph... is really one of the most disturbing, stomach-turning, grotesque photographs ever displayed,' Mr Kerry told reporters. 'Of a 7-year-old child holding a severed head up with pride and with the support and encouragement of a parent, with brothers there. 'That child should be in school, that child should be out learning about a future, that child should be playing with other kids - not holding a severed head and out in the field of combat.'","The 33-year-old didn't receive treatment for his mental state until mid-2008 .

"By . Charles Walford . and Michael Seamark . Updated: . 13:28 EST, 18 February 2012 . Rupert Murdoch came out fighting yesterday declaring his ‘unwavering support’ for Sun journalists and announcing that a Sunday version of the newspaper will be launched very soon. The media mogul flew into Britain to grapple with the crisis engulfing his News International group and immediately lifted the suspension of all staff arrested over alleged phone and computer hacking and bribery of officials. Staff have accused the company of a ‘witch hunt’ after an internal management committee passed information to police that led to the arrests of ten senior executives at the Sun. Scroll down for video . All smiles at The Sun: Rupert Murdoch smiles confidently as he leaves his home in Green Park and heads to The Sun's office yesterday . In a visit to News International’s . headquarters at Wapping, East London, Mr Murdoch told staff: ‘Everyone . is innocent unless proven otherwise.’ But he warned: ‘We will obey the law. Illegal activities simply cannot and will not be tolerated – at any of our publications.’ In an email, the 80-year-old News . Corporation chairman said recent events were ‘a source of great pain for . me, as I know it is for each of you’. ‘I’ve worked alongside you for 43 . years to build The Sun into one of the world’s finest papers. It is part . of me and is one of our proudest achievements,’ he said. Journalists at the tabloid are angry . that News Corporation’s Management Standards Committee gave police . information – including the identity of sources – that led to the . arrests, which include the deputy editor, picture editor and chief . reporter. Investigation: A detective leaves the home of Mike Sullivan, The Sun crime editor, with paperwork and other potential evidence last month after four of the paper's journalists were arrested . The MSC, which was formed to clean up . the company following the phone-hacking scandal, is trawling through . internal emails and passing details of suspected illegal activity to . Scotland Yard. The Metropolitan Police has arrested and bailed the ten Sun journalists, nine of them held in dawn raids on Saturdays. News International journalists fear further arrests. All were immediately . suspended on full pay in the wake of the arrests. But, Mr Murdoch . said he was doing 'everything to assist' them, including paying their . legal fees. He said they were free to work until any formal charges are made against them. He added: 'Everyone is innocent unless proven otherwise.' Despite . the invitation, it was not clear if all nine journalists would return . to work after it was reported that some were considering their . options. The heavy-handed police tactics have . drawn strong criticism, with the Yard accused of diverting officers from . murder, rape and terrorism investigations to join ‘Stasi-like’ raids . against journalists. Mr Murdoch, who dramatically closed . down the News of the World last July at the height of the phone-hacking . scandal, insisted journalists’ ‘legitimate’ confidential sources would . be protected. But he wrote: ‘We will turn over every . piece of evidence we find – not just because we are obligated to but . because it is the right thing to do. ‘I made a commitment last summer that . I would do everything I could to get to the bottom of our problems and . make this company an example to Fleet Street of ethical journalism.’ Mr Murdoch said he planned to remain . in London for several weeks and would build on the Sun’s ‘proud heritage . by launching the Sun on Sunday very soon’. Five staff at The Sun were arrested last weekend following information being passed to police by its parent company . Dear Colleagues: . I've worked alongside you for 43 years to build The Sun into one of the world's finest papers. It is a part of me and is one of our proudest achievements. The Sun occupies a unique and important position within News Corporation. I have immense respect for our heritage, your exceptional journalism and, above all, you, the talented women and men who work tirelessly every day to ensure our readers have access to such a trusted news source. I believe this newsroom is full of great journalists and I remain grateful for your superb work and for the stories you uncover to inform and protect the public. None more so than over the last three weeks. My continuing respect makes this situation a source of great pain for me, as I know it is for each of you. We will obey the law. Illegal activities simply cannot and will not be tolerated – at any of our publications. Our Board of Directors, our management team and I take these issues very seriously. Our independently chaired Management & Standards Committee, which operates outside of News International, has been instructed to cooperate with the police. We will turn over every piece of evidence we find -- not just because we are obligated to but because it is the right thing to do. We are doing everything we can to assist those who were arrested -- all suspensions are hereby lifted until or whether charged and they are welcome to return to work. News Corporation will cover their legal expenses. Everyone is innocent unless proven otherwise. I made a commitment last summer that I would do everything I could to get to the bottom of our problems and make this Company an example to Fleet Street of ethical journalism. We will continue to ensure that all appropriate steps are taken to protect legitimate journalistic privilege and sources, which I know are essential for all of you to do your jobs. But we cannot protect people who have paid public officials. I am confident we can live by these commitments and still produce great journalism. We will build on The Sun's proud heritage by launching The Sun on Sunday very soon. Our duty is to expand one of the world's most widely read newspapers and reach even more people than ever before. Having a winning paper is the best answer to our critics. I am even more determined to see The Sun continue to fight for its readers and its beliefs. I am staying with you all, in London, for the next several weeks to give you my unwavering support. I am confident we will get through this together and emerge stronger. Thank you, Rupert Murdoch . Labour leader Ed Miliband said yesterday he was 'outraged' that News Corporation executives were being criticised for co-operating with the police over claims of corrupt payments to public officials. Mr Miliband insisted Rupert Murdoch was 'absolutely right' to uncover what had taken place at the paper - and that the company ought to have helped police 'years ago'. 'I must say I think the people being outraged about what News International is doing to cooperate with the police - I'm outraged at that,"" he told BBC Radio 5 Live. 'Of course News International should be co-operating with the police. There is evidence, there are allegations anyway, of criminal activity. It would be quite wrong for them not to cooperate with the police.' Labour MP Tom Watson, who has been one of the leading figures campaigning against News International, said the launch of the new paper would not end the crisis. He tweeted: 'I'm told the PR line is to restate the plan for a Sun on Sunday. This will not draw a line under the crisis faced by News Corp in the UK.' Despite Mr Murdoch's charm offensive, many were still furious about the treatment of their colleagues at the hands of the MSC. In a sign of how low relations have sunk, one senior staff member dubbed former editor of the Daily Telegraph Will Lewis, an MSC member, the 'chief witch hunter' and said there would be demands that he be sacked. Sources close to the investigation believe they have . uncovered evidence of 'serious suspected criminality over a sustained . period' by some public officials supplying The Sun with information, . dismissing the suggestion from some reporters that they were being . investigated over 'trivial' matters, such as £50 lunches with sources. The MSC has been feeding Operation Elveden, the police investigation into corrupt payments, with information over the past few months. In all, 21 people have been held. The five members of Sun staff arrested last weekend were deputy editor of the paper Geoff Webster, chief reporter John Kay, picture editor John Edwards, deputy news editor John Sturgis and chief foreign correspondent Nick Parker. Also held in the dawn raids were a 39-year-old Ministry of Defence employee and a 36-year-old member of the Armed Forces. In January, senior members of The Sun's  newsroom were held by police and later released on bail. They were head of news Chris Pharo, executive editor Fergus Shanahan, crime editor Mike Sullivan as well as former managing editor Graham Dudman and a 29-year-old police officer. In July last year, former chief executive of News International and ex-Sun editor Rebekah Brooks was questioned by detectives as part of Operation Elveden and those involved with Operation Weeting, the investigation into alleged phone hacking by journalists. In November, long-serving journalist Jamie Pyatt was also arrested in relation to allegations of corrupt payments to police officers. The arrests followed the shock closure by News International of the News of the World in July last year after lurid phone hacking allegations emerged. The new Sunday tabloid the Sun on Sunday will replace the News of the World. No date has yet been announced for the . first edition of the paper - but Mr Murdoch said it would be . 'the best answer to our critics'. Journalists at The Sun, which is owned by News International, said they are the victims of a 'witch-hunt'","Embattled Murdoch comes out fighting with shock announcements in bid to save scandal-hit paper .

"By . Sam Creighton . and Claire Cisotti . Freed from the rigours of royal protocol, Cressida Bonas was sending a not-so-subtle message to the world this week with one very revealing outfit: She’s her own woman again. She was also making it very clear to former boyfriend Prince Harry just what he’s missing. From the front, it seemed that Cressida had chosen an understated — even boring — black silk top for a charity gala evening. Revealing: Cressida Bonas's backless top attracted the attention of onlookers and photographers at the Arts Antiques London Gala Evening held in aid of Children In Crisis . It was only when she turned round that the truth was revealed to be something altogether more racy. For her halter-neck was completely backless, save a tiny strip of fabric at the waist. And it not only revealed her tanned and toned back, but the ‘side boob’ view clearly showed that she was not wearing a bra. This was definitely not a look a Princess-in-waiting would have worn. The backless top, worn with trendy palazzo pants, certainly attracted the attention of onlookers and photographers at the Arts Antiques London Gala Evening  held in aid of Children In Crisis. Miss Bonas, 25, had been dating Prince Harry, 29, for two years before the couple split in April. But she was seen happily chatting to the Prince’s cousin, Princess Eugenie, at the Arts Antiques London Gala Evening held in aid of Children In Crisis. While Miss Bonas enjoyed her new-found freedom, Prince Harry was across town at Leicester Square for a red-carpet event celebrating the 50th anniversary of the film Zulu.

"By . Sam Creighton . He has written 30 books, presented nearly 760 South Bank Shows and fronted more than 600 episodes of Radio 4’s In Our Time. Yet, even at the age of 74, Melvyn Bragg shows no sign of easing up – because his extraordinary workload is the key to his health. In a deeply personal interview with Radio Times, he revealed that his workaholism was his salvation, protecting him from the mental breakdowns he suffered as a teenager and after the suicide of his first wife in 1971. Lady and Lord Bragg: Cate Haste (Lady . Bragg) and Lord Bragg are both celebrated authors . Lord Bragg said: ‘Work. Always. Switching your mind away from examining yourself, doing something satisfying. ‘Also finishing things. Completing all these TV programmes here, I’m elated. Done it!’ The broadcaster recalled that his children once ‘put in a tentative petition’ to be taken abroad on holiday  like their schoolfriends. He said: ‘They’d heard there was this place called France. “Can we go there, Dad?”’ But the only breaks he enjoys are those at his cottage in his native Cumbria and even there he writes non stop. Lord Bragg, who joined the BBC as a trainee in 1961, is  currently working on 52 programmes for Sky Arts including the latest series of the South Bank Show and says that he has no plans to retire. He also says he wants to use his parliamentary status – Labour made him a peer in 1998 – to promote culture. ‘If you look at the creative economy in this country, it’s per capita way bigger than any other in the world,’ he said. He admitted he had concerns about the Coalition’s support for the arts but added: ‘Looking back on the last 25 to 30 years, it’s par for the course. It’s very odd that philistine governments can do terrific things. ‘For instance, Margaret Thatcher’s government put Channel 4 in place. John Major created the lottery for the arts, which has had a massive effect on culture.’ He ruled out wanting to take the baton from Chris Patten as chairman of the BBC Trust. He said he had been offered administrative jobs before ‘and I haven’t given it a second thought. I got the job I wanted when I was 22 and I’m not going to give it up now’. Lord Bragg married French viscountess Lisa Roche in 1961 when she was 21. At the time of their marriage he did not know she had a history of suicide attempts and, despite extensive therapy,  she killed herself in 1971 by jumping out of a window. They had one child, a daughter. He told The Guardian in 1998: ‘I could have done things which helped and I did things which harmed. So yes, I feel guilt, I feel remorse.’ By the time of her death, Lord Bragg was estranged from his wife and in 1973 he married Cate Haste. They have a son and a daughter.","Lord Bragg, 74, says workaholism saved him when first wife killed herself .

"By . Sam Creighton . With tracks from Donna Summer, Kiss and Julio Iglesias, it’s hardly a politically charged collection. But, for paranoid officials in Moscow, the tunes were too dangerous for Soviet ears. The ‘ideologically harmful compositions’ were put on a secret blacklist along with Tina Turner, Madness and Village People. The list, which was put together by the Communist Party’s youth wing, was distributed to bureaucrats in January 1985, two months before Mikhail Gorbachev ascended to the premiership. Village People were on a secret blacklist . compiled in Moscow by the Communist Party's youth wing in January 1985 - . because they were too 'violent'. Above shows the reformed band, including two original members . It includes a wide range of reasons used to justify the banning of Western artists. Iglesias, known for his inoffensive ballads and love songs, was branded a ‘neo-fascist’, Miss Summer’s disco tunes had too much ‘eroticism’ and Village People were thought to be too ‘violent’. British singer Alison Moyet was also banned for apparent violence as well as for being a punk. Banning the artists only helped to make them more popular in Russia, according to Alexei Yurchak, who unearthed the blacklist. ‘The measures proposed to curb the spread of Western music helped to create the conditions that enabled its further expansion,’ said the assistant professor of anthropology at the University of California. Andrei Rogatchevski, a lecturer in Russian studies at Glasgow University, said: ‘The authorities didn’t like references to sex because they disliked any emotions they could not control. ‘They didn’t like violent lyrics because they might disturb Soviet order. And, as for any reference to fascism, that caused the deaths of millions of people.’ The list of forbidden musicians followed decades of cultural repression behind the Iron Curtain. There was mass destruction of pre-revolutionary and foreign books that were deemed politically offensive and notables who fell out of favour with the regime were routinely removed from texts and images. However, this repression led to an underground market for forbidden materials that was never entirely stamped out.","'Ideologically harmful compositions' put on secret blacklist of Western acts .

"By . Sam Creighton . and Hayley Coyle . Kirstie Allsopp, pictured here with her children, has suggested girls should ditch university and focus on becoming a mother . When it comes to domestic matters, she has always been outspoken. But Kirstie Allsopp’s latest advice to girls to forget university and concentrate on having babies first has attracted howls of outrage. She said that rather than go to university, young women should focus on finding a man and having a family before their fertility ‘falls off a cliff’ at 35. The 42-year-old television presenter – who gave birth to her two sons at 35 and 37 – said if she had a daughter she would give her this advice: ‘I would say, “Darling, do you know what? Don’t go to university. Start work straight after school, stay at home, save up your deposit – I’ll help you, let’s get you into a flat. And then we can find you a nice boyfriend and you can have a baby by the time you’re 27.”’ The Location, Location, Location star, who has been in a relationship with property developer Ben Andersen for ten years, said it is time to speak ‘frankly’ about fertility. ‘At the moment, women have 15 years to go to university, get their career on track, try and buy a home and have a baby. ‘That is a hell of a lot to ask someone. As a passionate feminist, I feel we have not been honest enough with women about this issue. We have to readjust. Don’t go to university because it’s an “experience”. No, it’s where you’re supposed to learn something! Do it when you’re 50!’ However, her comments in a newspaper interview yesterday attracted fierce criticism. Jo Heywood, headmistress of the prestigious girls-only Heathfield School, said: ‘Her talk of boyfriends and babies is rather patronising for the generation I am preparing for university and beyond.’ Conservative MP Angela Bray described Miss Allsopp as a ‘bit 1950s’. And psychologist Dr Linda Papadopoulos said: ‘It seems quite an antiquated idea that because we have ovaries, we shouldn’t have a career. I think this is telling girls to not do what is the most important thing at that age, which is to invest in your education, become self-sufficient. ‘It’s certainly not advice I would give my daughter.’ Miss Allsopp – who did not go to university – divided opinion among her 348,000 followers on Twitter. Some called her ‘stuck in the past’ but others agreed with her. However, she stood by her comments, tweeting yesterday: ‘Still pleased I raised the issue of the fertility window. It is scary being out on a limb and some folk being vile but majority sensible.’","Presenter, 42, urged women to ensure they have children at a young age .

"By . Sam Creighton . ITV has sparked outrage among viewers for airing an advert for the Church of Scientology in a prime-time slot. The broadcaster was accused of allowing the controversial group – which has been branded a ‘cult’ – to target vulnerable people after it showed its advert following its hit soap Coronation Street. It sparked complaints to the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA), which assessed whether they were serious enough to launch an investigation into banning the commercial from air. Scroll down for the advert . The Scientology advert aired between Coronation Street and Emmerdale. It attracted complaints but cannot be banned as it does not breach advertising rules . The ad, which features imposing buildings and smiling people, asks viewers to 'imagine science and religion connecting' However, as the advert does not breach any of its regulations, the ASA admitted it is powerless to act, despite public anger. ITV broadcast the 29-second clip at around 7.30pm on Monday evening, between primetime shows Coronation Street and Emmerdale. Depicting a montage of smiling people and imposing buildings with a voiceover, it encourages viewers to ‘Imagine science and religion connecting’. It ends with the statement: ‘Imagine everything you have ever imagined is possible’ as the Scientology website is displayed on the screen. Many viewers were astonished to see the advert on national TV. Writing on Twitter, pensioner Geoffrey Pearson said: ‘S***, I’ve just seen a Scientology Advert on ITV. How can we possibly allow those nutters to advertise on TV. Who next, Al Qaeda?’ Jonathan Harvey added: ‘An advert for Scientology in the Corrie ad break. Heavens.’ Jen Williams said: ‘Just saw a Scientology advert. Luckily there was nothing on hand to throw at the telly at the time.’ Some viewers have now set up a campaign on grassroots campaigning site Change.org, demanding that the ASA stops the advert from being shown again. The petition, which currently has 30 supporters, states: ‘It would be comical if its implications weren’t so potentially harmful. I hope most intelligent people that watch this advert will dismiss it as ludicrous.’ However, the director of Mediawatch UK Vivienne Pattison said that although she understands the concerns people have about the Scientology advert, there is little that can be done to stop it. She said: ‘There aren’t actually any rules saying you can or can’t advertise religion, which is how they have managed to get away with it. Complaints accused ITV of allowing Scientology - which has been branded a 'cult' - of choosing Coronation Street in order to target vulnerable people . 'The only rules that mention religion are that you shouldn’t have adverts that are likely to offend somebody. ‘The problem is that the ASA are going according with their code and there’s nothing in there saying you can or cannot advertise religion. 'If you say something that is patently untrue then they can do something but, a lot of the time, how can you say whether it is or is not? I think it’s really difficult.’ Set up in 1952 by US science-fiction novelist L. Ron Hubbard, Scientology has become known for celebrity adherents such as Tom Cruise and John Travolta. The religion, which is based around the idea that humans are ‘immortal beings’ who have forgotten their true nature, has been at the centre of a number of controversies. It has often been branded a cult although church leaders have repeatedly denied it brainwashes adherents. Scientology has become famous for celebrity adherents including John Travolta, Will Smith, and Tom Cruise (pictured) In February, the Supreme Court ruled that the Church of Scientology in London was a place of ‘religious worship’ and so could hold weddings. The Scientology advert was vetted in March by Clearcast, the official body in charge of making sure adverts do not breach broadcasting codes before they are shown to the public. It is thought to have been shown a handful of times on ITV since then, with Monday’s screening the latest. A spokeswoman for the organisation said it was not the first Scientology advert they have cleared for UK broadcast in recent years, and insisted there was no reason to reject the Church’s application. Similar Scientology adverts have been screened on ITV over the past two years. The ASA said it received 24 complaints about the latest advert. It said some complained that as they considered Scientology to be a cult and it could target vulnerable people. However, the body said it had decided the advert did not breach any of its codes. The spokesman said: ‘We carefully considered the complaints but decided that there weren’t grounds for further action. 'We understood that some viewers might consider the ad in poor taste because they disapproved of the practices and beliefs of the advertisers, or because they did not believe ads for religious organisa-tions should be broadcast on TV. ‘However, the Advertising Code does not prohibit ads for religious organisations from being broadcast on channels. 'The ad itself did not contain either explicit statements of belief or incitements for viewers to change their own beliefs, and only included the advertisers’ website address, and so was unlikely to breach the Code for these reasons.’ In February 2012, the ASA banned a Christian group in Bath from claiming God can heal in its leaflets and on its website, arguing that it could encourage false hope. Asked to justify the decision to show the advert, a spokesman for ITV simply reiterated that the advert had been cleared by Clearcast. A spokesman for the Church of Scientology in the UK said: ‘There is always a buzz, both positive and negative, that occurs in social media whenever anything interesting happens in this world.","Advert shown in the break between Emmerdale and Coronation Street .

"By . Sam Creighton . 'Hurt': Alan Titchmarsh has revealed he stepped down after 30 years of hosting BBC's coverage of the Chelsea Flower Show because he was not given the role of lead presenter . After 30 years hosting BBC coverage of the Chelsea Flower Show, Alan Titchmarsh’s departure left his  fans bemused. Now he has revealed he stepped down because his role as lead presenter was given to fellow gardener and Daily Mail columnist Monty Don. Mr Titchmarsh said he was ‘hurt’ by the Corporation’s decision to do so and when asked to play second-fiddle to Mr Don, he said he was made ‘an offer I had to refuse’. It is believed to be the first time . the former Gardeners’ World presenter, 65, has spoken in detail about . his announcement in November last year to quit the Chelsea Flower Show. In an interview with the Radio Times, he said he was not bitter and he had moved on. But he admitted: ‘Yes, I suppose I was hurt, because I know people enjoy you doing it as much as I loved doing it. ‘But . they probably felt it was time for a change and may well be right. Was I . dumped for Monty Don? You might say that. I couldn’t possibly comment. I . don’t feel dumped. They made me an offer I had to refuse. It’s up to them. I’m not bitter. ‘I . was disappointed but I’m not a grudge-bearer. You have to move on. Nobody owes you a living. I’m still gainfully employed. My days aren’t . empty.’ Mr Titchmarsh was . the unofficial face of Chelsea Flower Show for 30 years gaining as much . attraction from television viewers as the prize-winning gardens. The . chat show host denied that his replacement’s lack of horticultural . training - Don is a self-professed ‘amateur gardener’ - bothered him. ‘Presenting . is a skill in itself. I’ve presented programmes on classical music, . nature and the royal family, all lifelong interests. I don’t hold Monty . Don’s lack of training against him,’ he said. Titchmarsh, . who was succeeded by Don on Gardeners’ World when he left in 2002, . added: ‘He’s passionate and he gets through to a lot of people. We have . different audiences. Good luck to him. I’m not going to slag him off.’ Asked whether he agreed with garden designer Diarmuid Gavin, who described Don as a ‘brilliant gardener’, he said: ‘I don’t know enough about him to say. I know I recommended him to take over Gardeners’ World from me because he was a good anchorman.’ The role of lead presenter for the Chelsea Flower Show coverage on the BBC has been given to gardener and Daily Mail columnist Monty Don . Titchmarsh added: ‘Jealousy eats you away. There’s no point. Leave it behind. We’ve all got problems, had tragedies in our lives. I don’t see any point in whingeing.’ ‘A trouble shared is a trouble dragged out till bedtime. The people who have life sussed are outward-looking, doing stuff for other folk. ‘There’s so much self-analysis now. I realise it seems rich coming from someone whose work is in the media, the cult of personality if you like, but fame is a by-product, not a goal. What drives me is contentment, satisfaction and stimulation, and the avoidance of jealousy and bitterness. Those things don’t achieve anything.’ Despite this, Mr Titchmarsh claims never to have watched Gardeners’ World – which he fronted for six years – since Mr Don took over. Interview: Alan Titchmarsh opens up in the latest issue of the Radio Times . He said: ‘I’d either be grumpy because I didn’t like what they were doing, or uppity because they were doing it too well. It wouldn’t be healthy for me to watch so I moved on.’ This year marks Titchmarsh’s fiftieth as a professional gardener and will also see him publish a book on the Queen’s palaces and present television shows Britain’s Best Gardens and Love Your Garden, as well as his weekly slot on Classic FM. The dad-of-two, who made his name bringing gardening to the masses on BBC One’s Ground Force, has become a personality trusted by millions for his DIY and gardening know-how. And Mr Titchmarsh will still be associated with the Chelsea Flower Show, which opens later this month, he will be showcasing a garden  – his first at the event since 1985 – commissioned by the Royal Horticultural Society to mark the fiftieth anniversary of their Britain in Bloom campaign. Known for his sunny disposition, Mr Titchmarsh said he won’t use his high profile to dig at his former employers, even agreeing to be interviewed for the coverage he used to front. In the wide-ranging interview for the Radio Times, Mr Titchmarsh expanded on controversial comments he made last year about how older women on TV should stop ‘whinging’ about ageism. He warned women to be certain they are being discriminated against because of age, and not incompetence, before making such allegations. He said: ‘I don’t think I’d be confident enough to say, ‘They’ve stopped me doing this because I’m too old,’ because my inner voice would be saying, ‘No, they’ve stopped you doing it, love, because you’re not terribly good anymore.’’ Filling the secondary role that Mr Titchmarsh turned down is newsreader Sophie Raworth. The BBC News at One presenter, while insisting she comes from a ‘family of gardeners’, admits she is ‘not a professional’.","Alan Titchmarsh leaves BBC's coverage of Chelsea Flower Show .

"By . Sam Creighton . Charlize Theron sparked outrage last night by comparing media intrusion into her personal life to rape. The South African actress, 38, was accused of cheapening the suffering of victims after she made the insensitive remarks in a TV interview. The Oscar-winner was also branded a hypocrite because of her past as an anti-rape campaigner and for using a media appearance to make the comparison. Courting controversy: Charlize Theron said she doesn't Google herself because 'it feels like being raped' Appearing on Sky News – to promote her latest film – she was asked if she ever Googled herself. Miss Theron replied: ‘I don’t do that, so that’s my saving grace. 'When you start living in that world, and doing that, you start, I guess, feeling raped.’ The actress, who hours earlier had been photographed leaving Claridge’s hotel in London with her adopted son Jackson, two, and her partner, fellow Oscar-winner Sean Penn, 53, was then pushed on whether she really felt invasions of her privacy were equivalent to sexual violence. Miss Theron replied: ‘Well, you know when it comes to your son and your private life. Maybe that’s just me. Awareness: Twitter user Cliff Murray said the timing of Charlize Theron's comments is 'shocking given the brutal rape and murders in India' 'Get a grip': Danielle Hayward described the actress as a 'complete moron' after hearing her comments . Controversial: The Hollywood actress Charlize Theron has compared press intrusion to rape in an interview . 2004: Defends her mother for shooting her alcoholic father dead in front of her in 1991, telling American TV channel ABC: ‘He was a verbal abuser… and I know that if my daughter was in the same situation, I would do the same thing.’ (To promote Monster) 2005: Tells Oprah Winfrey: ‘The way my father died was traumatic. I would wish for nothing more in my life than for it not to have happened the way it did. But I can’t change that.’ (Aeon Flux) 2008: Tells The Guardian: ‘I’m a sexual creature. There’s nothing wrong with that. Why do we have to be ashamed of being so many different things? Why do we have to be only one thing, a good mother or a hooker? I don’t think that what’s under my clothes is evil.’ (Hancock) 2010: On her desire to have children with then boyfriend Stuart Townsend: ‘I’m reaching the point where I want to be a mom and Stuart is the man I want to take that step with.’ (The Road) 2012: On adopting Jackson: ‘I always knew I would adopt. I don’t think any mother aims to be a single mum. I didn’t wish for that but it happened.’ (Snow White And The Huntsman and Prometheus) 2014: On marriage: ‘I never had the dream of the white dress. And watching other people getting married? I think it’s beautiful for them, but to be quite honest, usually I’m sitting there just devastated.’ (A Million Ways To Die In The West) 'Some people might relish all that . stuff but there are certain things in my life that I think of as very . sacred and I am very protective over them.’ Rape campaigners condemned the . actress’s remarks, made while she was meant to be talking about her new . film A Million Ways To Die In The West, a comedy western. Others pointed out she has regularly used media interviews to offer up details of her personal life while promoting her films. Karen Ingala Smith, chief executive of victim support charity Nia, which runs the East London Rape Crisis Service, said: ‘There’s one thing that’s like rape and that’s rape. 'It weakens what we understand as rape when we use that word inappropriately. It cheapens the aftermath of rape and it cheapens [victims’] suffering. ‘If Charlize Theron spent an afternoon listening to a rape crisis helpline she would understand very quickly that unwanted press attention is very different.’ Katie Russell from Rape Crisis England and Wales added that Miss Theron had no excuse for making comments that would ‘upset people who have survived attacks’. She said: ‘It is always disappointing when someone high profile uses that language and turns sexual violence into a metaphor for something else. ‘It is never appropriate and it trivialises the experience of sexual violence. ‘It’s particularly disappointing in this case because Charlize Theron has campaigned against sexual violence before.’ Miss Theron has been involved in several anti-rape campaigns, including appearing in a South African advert in 1999 standing under a banner reading ‘Real men don’t rape’. The actress, who won an Oscar for her portrayal of a serial killer in Monster, was also criticised on social media. Mark Merryweather wrote: ‘How dare Charlize Theron compare press intrusion to rape – try telling a victim of rape that.’ Miss Theron is not the first celebrity to court criticism in this way. In 2010, Kristen Stewart apologised after telling a magazine that looking at paparazzi photos of herself was like ‘looking at someone being raped’. In 2011, Johnny Depp said being photographed by the paparazzi makes ‘you just feel like you’re being raped somehow’. He later apologised.","Hollywood actress caused a backlash on Twitter following the remarks .

"By . Gerard Couzens, In Marbella . and Arthur Martin . Created: . 03:04 EST, 13 May 2014 . A British millionaire accused of keeping a harem of lovers against their will at his Spanish mansion claims he was framed in an elaborate theft plot. Oil tycoon Shoja Shojai, 56, was arrested after nine women claimed he used emotional abuse and threats of violence to keep them at his villa in Marbella. The group, who are mostly aspiring models in their 20s, told police that he had fathered seven of their children and made them take it in turns to spend the night with him in an adjoining property. Defiant: Shoja Shojai, an Iranian-born British oil millionaire, has hit out at claims he held nine women against their will . Innocence: The women at his house were fashion students who were free to come and go, he insists . Luxury: Mr Shojai rents the holiday mansion in Marbella for a cost of £6,500 per month . But in an extraordinary twist, Mr . Shojai yesterday claimed that the women made up the ‘ludicrous’ allegations as part of a plot to steal from him. He alleged that while he was in . custody for two days they hired two 45ft trucks to take 75 Persian rugs, . 20 tapestries and jewels worth £2million from his ten-bedroom house. Mr Shojai admitted having a sexual . relationship with three of the women, including his wife, a 33-year-old . Dane who he is divorcing. The Iranian-born businessman, who has a . British passport and has spent most of his life in the UK,  also claimed . to have only four  children, two with his wife. He added: ‘The idea I had a harem is madness. ‘It’s impossible to keep one woman, let alone nine. I have slept with three of my female accusers including my wife. Opulent: The lavishly decorated drawing room of Mr Shojai's house where he is accused of holding his lovers prisoner . Home: The swimming pool attached to the Marbella mansion, where Mr Shojai is now holed up with a gardener and housekeeper . ‘The other women were simply friends . of theirs who worked with them in the fashion business and had their own . homes and came and went from my house when they wanted. The claim I was . holding them here against their will is ludicrous.’ Mr Shojai claims his accusers . carefully planned the theft by hiring a warehouse in Germany a month . ahead of time to store stolen goods, and that they booked the removal . trucks two weeks ago. He claims that one of the women acted . as the ringleader, accusing her of reporting him to police for physical . assault in an attempt to solve her ‘major financial problems’. ‘She told the others I had been . arrested by the FBI and taken to Guantanamo Bay and they needed to pack . up and leave before the police arrived,’ he said. ‘They fell for it. My . house was robbed while I was in the police station answering domestic . violence allegations made against me. Plot: Mr Shojai says he is the victim of a conspiracy to loot thousands of valuable objects from his home . Bedroom: One of the eight bedrooms installed at the Marbella mansion where nine women were allegedly imprisoned . Sun-kissed: But the mansion was hellish for the women forced to live there, according to some of them . Home: One of the alleged mistresses used to live in this terrace in the London district of Maida Vale . ‘Thankfully I was released from custody in time and we managed to stop the trucks before they left Spain.’ He added: ‘I completely and absolutely deny all the allegations made against me. This was a cover-up to rob me.’ Mr Shojai, who says he set up a . Swiss-based oil brokerage firm, Universal Resources Industries, after . being privately educated in England, has hired three lawyers. The women say he met most of them at a . London fashion school and told them he was an oil tycoon with powerful . friends who could help their careers. They say he reneged on his . promises and used  verbal abuse and threats of violence to keep them in . his luxurious mansion. The women, who knew him as Sasha, come . from a variety  of countries, including Russia, Germany, Mongolia and . Kazakhstan. The businessman claimed one of his accusers is said to have a house in . Chelsea. Investigation: Mr Shojai, pictured on the steps outside his holiday mansion, is currently the subject of a judicial probe . Anger: Mr Shojai says that while he was being questioned, removal vans took his possessions away . Clearing the air: Speaking from his lavishly appointed drawing room, Mr Shojai repeated claims of his innocence . He added: ‘I had a sexual relationship . four years ago with [one of the women] for one month and with another . approximately two years ago. I was separated from my wife at the time . and did not consider myself to be married and I did not keep a harem . here. ‘They had the best of everything. I . can’t understand why they didn’t just take the jewellery and go instead . of making up these abuse allegations.’ One of his accusers, who asked not be named, strongly denied his claims and said the women’s story is true. She commented: ‘We haven’t given one . millimetre of wrong information from our side and it can all be proved . so I’m not worried. He’s trying to ruin  our lives even more by speaking . publicly.’","Shoja Shojai, 56, has been questioned by police over claims he kept nine women at Marbella home against their will .

"By . Arthur Martin . British companies may soon have to treat obese workers as ‘disabled’ and provide them with larger seats and parking spaces next to the office. A test case which will be heard on Thursday by the European Court of Justice could make legal history by banning bosses across Europe, including Britain, from discriminating against obese employees. The case is being brought by overweight child-minder Karsten Kaltoft who was sacked by his local authority in Denmark for being unable to perform his duties due to his size. 25stone Karsten Kaltoft was sacked by his local authority in Denmark for being unable to perform his duties due to his size . The council, Billund Kommune, claimed the 25st child-minder was so fat that he required help from a colleague to tie up children's shoelaces. If successful in redefining obesity as a disability, Mr Kaltoft's lawyers could force widespread changes in the way bosses deal with staff. Employers would have to find ways of accommodating fat workers so that they are not at a disadvantage to their slimmer colleagues. In Britain, rates of obesity have doubled in the past three decades and 64 per cent of adults are now overweight. The Luxembourg court will be asked to decide if his obesity is a disability under EU law and if his employer was guilty of discrimination by dismissing him. The council, Billund Kommune, claimed Mr Kaltoft, a 25st child-minder, was so fat that he required help from a colleague to tie up children's shoelaces . Judges will also consider whether it applies just to the public sector or across the whole labour market. Audrey Williams, from Eversheds law firm, said: ‘This ruling could be significant for employers in Britain, which has the highest percentages of obesity in Europe. ‘Obesity, however it will come to be defined, would need to be approached just like any other physical or mental impairment, preventing an employer from treating an employee less favourably. This would include the ability to dismiss. ‘Access to the office and seating arrangements may have to be reviewed. Might obese employees need preferential access to car parking?’ Vanessa Di Cuffa, from Shakespeares law firm, urged employers to help workers who wanted to lose weight by offering them subsidised gym membership and by encouraging them to avoiding sugary snacks. The Employment Appeals Tribunal ruled last year that a man was disabled even though the cause of his numerous medical problems had no identifiable cause and were compounded by his obesity. This year the National Obesity Forum estimated that half the British population would be obese by 2050. One in ten deaths in England and Wales is now due to people being overweight, the government's top medical adviser has said. Professor Dame Sally Davies, the chief medical officer of England, highlighted research suggesting that between 40,000 and 53,000 deaths in England and Wales next year would be attributable to excess weight. These include more than three quarters of diabetic deaths and a quarter of deaths from heart disease. The study, by the University of Cambridge, suggested that about 10per cent of deaths would be the result of excess weight. ‘It is worrying that studies show some people who are overweight believe they are about the right weight,’ Dame Sally has said. ‘This normalisation is even more worrying when it comes to children. In one study, 77per cent of parents of overweight children did not recognise that their child was overweight.’","Mr Kaltoft was sacked by his local authority in Denmark for being unable to perform his duties due to his size .

"By . Arthur Martin . FIFA faced a backlash from its major sponsors last night as the corruption scandal intensified over the decision to award the 2022 World Cup to Qatar. Adidas, Visa and Sony expressed their anger after further allegations emerged that the football governing body’s former vice president, Mohamed Bin Hammam, used bribes to secure votes for Qatar’s bid. The global firms are three of the six main sponsors – known as partners – of the World Cup, which starts in Brazil on Thursday. Scroll down for video . Reaction: Adidas, Visa and Sony expressed their anger after further allegations emerged that the football governing body¿s former vice president, Mohamed Bin Hammam (pictured), used bribes to secure votes for Qatar's bid . Fifa made £1billion from sponsorship at the previous World Cup in South Africa and relies heavily on continued advertising revenue from major firms. In a strongly worded statement,  Adidas said ‘the negative tenor of the public debate around Fifa at the moment is neither good for football nor for Fifa and its partners’. Meanwhile electronics giant Sony called on Fifa to carry out an ‘appropriate investigation’ into claims of wholesale corruption during the bidding process. A spokesman said: ‘We expect these allegations to be investigated appropriately. We continue to expect Fifa to adhere to its principles of integrity, ethics and fair play across all aspects of its operations.’ Visa spoke of its desire for the governing body to ‘maintain strong ethical standards’. ‘We understand Fifa is taking this matter seriously and we will continue to monitor its internal investigation,’ it said. ‘We expect Fifa will take the appropriate actions.’ Outrage: Former sports minister David Mellor has said the tournament should never have been given to Qatar . Fifa’s contract with Adidas is worth £210million and Visa’s bill for its sponsorship is £100million. Sony’s agreement expires this year, giving it particular leverage as it negotiates a new deal. The other three major sponsors – Coca-Cola, Hyundai and Emirates – were approached for comment yesterday but did not respond. Former Conservative sports minister David Mellor said: ‘What is quite clear is this World Cup should never have been awarded to Qatar and can never be played in Qatar.’ Further damning claims surrounding the bid were published yesterday. Mr Bin Hammam, Qatar’s top football chief, stands accused of organising a major gas deal to secure key votes for the country’s World Cup bid. A cache of millions of leaked documents revealed how he brokered government-level talks through the Thai member of Fifa’s executive committee over the deal, which was potentially worth tens of millions of pounds to Thailand. He is also accused of setting up meetings between the Qatari royal family and at least seven Fifa committee members, including president Sepp Blatter. The revelations come a week after the Sunday Times first published claims Mr Bin Hammam used £3million from secret slush funds to bribe officials. Fifa’s chief investigator, Michael Garcia, is assessing the process and will submit a report next month. Mr Blatter finally broke his silence over the claims yesterday, writing on Twitter: ‘Never ignoring media reports on ethics allegations in football. But let the Ethics Committee work!’ Controversial: Argentina's players posesfor a picture with a banner reading in Spanish 'The Malvinas are Argentine' From CHRISTIAN GYSIN IN RIO DE JANEIRO . The arrival of the England team in Brazil was mired in controversy yesterday as players immediately found themselves drawn into a storm over the sovereignty of the Falkland Islands. The moment midfielder Frank Lampard emerged from the team bus outside their hotel near Rio de Janeiro yesterday, one journalist, thought to be Argentine, could be heard shouting: ‘What do you think about the Falklands – or Las Malvinas?’ Lampard ignored the question as the squad entered the hotel. Tensions rose after Argentine players unfurled a banner before their warm-up friendly against Slovenia, claiming sovereignty of the islands they call Las Malvinas. Before the game in Argentina, players unfurled a banner saying: ‘Las Malvinas Son Argentinas (The Malvinas are Argentine).’ The FA appeared to have been anticipating the row – which has overshadowed World Cup clashes between England and Argentina since the Eighties – as Roy . Hodgson’s side played their own final warm-up game in Miami on Saturday. Pictures show a whiteboard in the England dressing room filled with team tactics, including the words ‘DON’T ANSWER QUESTIONS ON FALKLANDS!!!’ in capitals.","Companies reacted to accusations concerning Mohammed Bin Hammam .

"By . Arthur Martin . Bell ringing, roast beef for Sunday lunch and watching the Red Arrows are among the things that define  Britain – at least according to the great and good. In a special issue, Country Life magazine has created a comprehensive list of the ‘Best of Britain’ recruiting contributors from James Dyson to Jools Holland and from John Major to Princess Anne. In a special issue entitled ‘our nation’s greatest glories’, the upmarket bible of rural Britain has enlisted the help of the great and the good in an attempt to define our nation. Defining the nation: A traditional Sunday roast features on the 'Best of Britain' list compiled by Country Life magazine . The countryside and outdoor activities feature heavily throughout the list. Thatched roofs and country cottages are included, as are Wellington boots – which are ‘an essential for fashionistas as farmers’. The 1,000-year-old English oak, described as ‘an enduring symbol of Britain itself’, and grass lawns, described as ‘something of an obsession for British men’, both feature. Our obsession with dog breeds is noted, particularly Jack Russells, lurchers, springer spaniels, setters and beagles which all have British origins. However, the magazine admits that the nation’s favourite dog – the labrador – is in fact an import. Explorers also make the list – from Captain Robert Scott’s ill-fated race to the South Pole to Sir Ranulph Fiennes becoming the oldest Briton to reach the summit of Mount Everest at the age of 65. On the gastronomic side, stilton, apples, condiments such as HP Sauce and Branston Pickle, Scotch whisky and traditional afternoon tea are all key ingredients of Britain. There is also a nod to the English language which is ‘not an easy tongue to master as it continues to grow and evolve at a rapid rate’, the magazine says. Country Life also highlights the importance of the Queen, particularly with regard to the state opening of parliament, which she has done every session since she was crowned, except for in 1959 and 1963 when she was pregnant. Former Prime Minister John Major said: ‘The Queen has been a constant, moving with the times – and indeed, often ahead of public opinion. ‘Time and again, she has instinctively gauged the pulse of our nation. 'For our country, the monarchy is a focus no politician can match.’","The 'Best of Britain' list features the things that define the nation .

"By . Arthur Martin . Coy: Irish model Nadia Forde, who is friends with Rory McIlroy . Sinking a simple putt may have won him the Open – but was there a greater driving force behind Rory McIlroy’s triumph yesterday? A budding romance, perhaps? The victory – and spectacular return to form – meant the 25-year-old golf star became the third youngest player to win three major championships. It all coincides with his blossoming friendship with Irish lingerie model Nadia Forde. After being introduced by mutual friends last year, the pair have remained tight-lipped about  the nature of their relationship. Meanwhile McIlroy’s ex-fiancee,  Danish tennis star Caroline Wozniacki, 24, seems to be thriving on being a single woman after winning the Istanbul Cup yesterday – her first title of the year. McIlroy and Miss Forde, 25, certainly seem to be getting closer. He missed a practice session before the Open when he learnt that Miss Forde had been involved in a car crash last weekend. Her Fiat 500 Abarth flipped six times before crashing into the central reservation on the M40 in Warwickshire when she was driving from London to Manchester. She suffered only minor bruising and a bump to her head. After the crash, McIlroy said: ‘If anyone is involved in a car crash you are glad to see they are OK but yeah, obviously, it was a pretty scary incident.’ The golfer, who split from Miss Wozniacki in May after the couple sent out their wedding invitations, has been reluctant to answer questions about any potential new romance. But after he was spotted getting close to Miss Forde in a Dublin bar earlier this month, he rediscovered the kind of golfing form which propelled him to the top of the world rankings two years ago. Miss Forde is a model, actress and singer who regularly appears on Irish television. She has previously described McIlroy as a ‘lovely guy’, although she too has been coy about the nature of their relationship. ‘The bottom line with me and Rory is we have mutual friends who introduced us and we’ve been in each other’s company,’ she said. When asked if the golfer was her type she replied: ‘I don’t really have a type, to be honest with you.’ Miss Forde said her ideal man would be ‘a bit of a cheeky chappie who makes me laugh ... a guy with a twinkle in his eye’. She added: ‘For me it’s not about looks. It’s about the person. I think whoever I end up with I will be friends with first. Scroll down for video .

That for me is a massive turn-on.’ The model did not attend the Open at the Royal Liverpool Golf Club, in Hoylake, the Wirral, despite speculation that she might make an appearance. She is thought to be in Florida. All the same McIlroy punched the air with delight, then hugged his tearful mother Rosie after sinking a simple putt to clinch the Claret Jug – and a cheque for £975,000 – by two shots last night. Describing his win, the Northern Irishman told the BBC: ‘It feels incredible. It wasn’t easy. There were a few guys making runs at me and I just needed to stay focused. ‘To win three legs of the grand slam at 25 is a pretty big achievement.’ He added: ‘This is the first major my mum has been to that I’ve won, so mum, this one’s for you. ‘I just can’t wait to get back and defend this thing at St Andrews next year.’","Open champion's incredible victory coincides with growing friendship .

"By . Sam Marsden . and Arthur Martin . Missing: James Male, 23, with girlfriend Adele Miller . Relatives of four British sailors missing in the Atlantic Ocean pleaded yesterday for the search for their loved ones to be resumed. The US coastguard called off the hunt for the crew of 40ft yacht Cheeki Rafiki on Sunday after two days, saying the men were unlikely to have survived in the severe weather for more than 20 hours. But family and friends of the yachtsmen – who were sailing back to Britain from a Caribbean regatta when their boat capsized – believe they are still alive and awaiting rescue. Sir Robin Knox-Johnston, the first person to sail solo non-stop around the world, said it was 'very likely' the four experienced sailors had escaped into the boat's life-raft. Another theory is that they are surviving in an air pocket underneath the vessel's hull. Cheeki Rafiki captain Andrew Bridge, 22, and crew members James Male, 23, Steve Warren, 52, and Paul Goslin, 56, were around 620 miles east of Cape Cod, Massachusetts, when the yacht began taking on water last Thursday. They told their base in Southampton they were diverting to the Azores, but contact was lost in the early hours of Friday morning. Yesterday the family of Mr Warren, a project manager from Wincanton, Somerset, said they are convinced he is alive. His sister Kay Coombes, 46, said: 'We are grateful to the coastguards for what they have done so far, but it's stopped too soon. They are four strong-minded, physically strong sailors.' All smiles: The last picture of the crew of the Cheeki Rafiki shows the sailors enjoying an awards ceremony at the end of the Antigua Sailing Week 2014. Steve Warren is shown left, Paul Goslin, is second left, Andrew Bridge is seen second to right, and James Male is pictured right . She added: 'They knew they were in difficulties and had every opportunity to get into the life-raft, which would have had provisions for several days.' Last night more than 70,000 people had signed an online petition calling on the US to resume the search, with Olympic sailing champion Sir Ben Ainslie backing the campaign on Twitter. The Cheeki Rafiki had taken part in the Antigua Sailing Week regatta. A picture taken on the final day shows the four men relaxed and smiling, with Mr Male, of Southampton, clutching a trophy and a bottle of champagne. The father of Mr Bridge, a highly experienced yacht skipper despite his young age, also appealed to the US coastguard yesterday. 'We're going through hell': Kay Coombes, sister of missing yachtsman Stephen Warren, has been told 40 private boats are to search for the boat, which lost contact with land on Friday . David Bridge, 51, from Farnham in Surrey, said: 'Please keep looking. The longer they delay the less time there will be to find them.' He said Foreign Office diplomats were trying to 'exert pressure' on US officials, but could do little else. Cressida Goslin, 51, the wife of Mr Goslin, from West Camel, Somerset, told BBC Radio 4's World At One programme: 'There are four British people on that boat...  if we don't try to rescue them we are just going to leave them to starve to death.' US officials yesterday said air crews had scoured an area of more than 4,000 square miles without finding any trace of the missing sailors. Hull sighting: On Saturday, a cargo vessel, the MV Maersk Kure, spotted and photographed an overturned hull, pictured, which matched the description of the Cheeki Rafiki but reported no signs of people on board . US . and Canadian aircraft and merchant vessels looked for the crew . throughout Friday and Saturday but later called off the search. Stormforce director Doug Innes said he was 'devastated' the search had . been stoppedOn Saturday, a cargo ship crew spotted the overturned hull of a boat matching the description of the Cheeki Rafiki, but saw no signs of the men or a life-raft. Captain Anthony Popiel, of the US coastguard, said: 'Assuming best-case emergency equipment, the estimated survival time past the time of distress was approximately 20 hours. Crews searched for 53 hours.' Simon Boxall, an oceanographer at the University of Southampton, admitted finding the men was unlikely. He said the US coastguard is among the best in the world, and the search would not have been called off if officials 'genuinely thought there was hope'.

"By . Peter Allen . and Arthur Martin . It was a miracle he made it out to sea at all. Yet this young Afghan migrant had hoped to cross the Channel on a raft made of a few nailed-together bits of plank, with a bedsheet held by tent poles for a sail. His desperate attempt reach  Britain almost ended in disaster as his makeshift craft was blown into the path of a P&O passenger ferry near Calais. Fortunately the crew of the Spirit of Britain spotted the 23-year-old. If you got points for effort... French coast guard rescue Asif Hussein Khail who tried to cross the Channel on a makeshift raft using a bedsheet as a sail . When rescued from the world’s busiest shipping lane, he was drenched and suffering from hypothermia. He told French coastguards his dream was to ‘travel to England to start a new life’ and he would stop at nothing to get here. Coastguard . chief Bernard Barron said the young migrant, spotted drifting off . Sangatte on Monday at 2pm, would never have made it to the UK. His . raft was so flimsy he would probably have been killed – and the wind . was in the wrong direction, blowing him up the coast rather than across . the Channel. ‘He was upset . at being caught to begin with, but was then very happy to be safe,’ said . Mr Barron. ‘If the wind had risen, or the raft had collided with a . ferry, then he would have capsized and died.’ The . man, who had no documents and refused to give his name, received . medical treatment before being handed over to French border police. Last . night sources in Calais said the man would almost certainly have been . released without charge – leaving him free to try to reach the UK again. His desperate attempt comes as many of the hundreds massing in Calais to get to Britain increasingly put their lives in danger by plunging into the sea. Mr Barron said the man had built his raft using wooden planks, a float wrapped in tarpaulin, and a table leg supporting a makeshift mast and white sheet. The . man, who did not have any documents on him and cannot be identified, . was dressed in a blue tracksuit and woolly hat, and carried all his . possessions in a small rucksack on his back. Mr . Barron said the Afghan's brave solo effort, discovered on Monday, was . undoubtedly nothing to do with the gangs of people smugglers currently . operating in Calais. ‘They . do not encourage migrants to travel alone, and certainly not in the . sea,’ he said, saying that the migrant was ‘handed over to the border . police’ after medical treatment. He was then likely to be freed without charge – leaving him free to continue to try and get to Britain, where he will claim asylum or else disappear into the black economy. France is to bulldoze camps containing hundreds of illegal migrants hoping to travel to Britain from Calais because of a growing danger to public health, it emerged today . Local prefect Denis Robin also said there were particular 'fears for public health', especially as the makeshift camps do not have basic supplies like water . Last month four would-be immigrants to Britain were taken to hospital suffering from severe hypothermia after being caught in the sea off Calais. In a further sign of the desperate methods being used by the migrants, all were trying to get aboard England-bound ferries moored in the harbour. It follows four other migrants dying in a single week in Calais as they risked life and limb for the chance to claim residency in the UK. Clutching waterproof bundles full of food and other essentials, the men swam out from Fort Risban, part of the city’s ancient fortifications. ‘The idea was to swim out to the ferries so as to avoid customs and other checks,’ said a local police spokesman. ‘Fisherman spotted them, and alerted the authorities. Port patrol cars were on the quay alongside them within a few minutes.’ Police in the French port said that many of the settlements would be 'cleared by the end of next week,' to stop them getting bigger . The migrants play a nightly game of cat and mouse with the police as they try their luck at getting to Britain . Three of the men were plucked out of the water relatively easily, but one went missing and got into difficulty into deep water. The body of an Eritrean who also tried to swim across the harbour drowned in exactly the same spot last October. Hundreds of migrants from outside the EU are living in a camp yards from the perimeter fence of Calais port. Charities . say there are more than 650 in the town, the greatest number since the . closure of the Red Cross camp at Sangatte in 2002 – and they are taking . advantage of gaps in security and a minimal police presence. There are currently up to 1000 migrants living rough in Calais, with up to 650 around the port area alone . On March 9 an Albanian man was killed on a motorway outside the town. Three days later, Ethiopian Mesfin Germa was hit by a lorry as he walked to the port. The body of a 25-year-old Ethiopian man, Senay Berthay, was found in Calais’s  Batellerie dock on March 14 and the next day a fellow Ethiopian in his 20s was crushed to death by a car while hiding on a  vehicle transporter. It is thought he had been among a group of three men who got on the truck and then realised it was going in the wrong direction.

"By . Arthur Martin . FOR parents, taking their children on holiday during term time means sanctions, fines and the threat of legal action. But for the headmaster of Little Hill primary school wanting a vacation, it appears no such rules apply. From the day her pupils return to school after Easter, Vina Pankhania will enjoy nearly a month off to get married – and come back just before school breaks up again for summer half-term. Big day: The head of a Leicestershire school has asked for unpaid leave to marry partner Amit . Following a clampdown at the school, parents have regularly been warned their children are not allowed time off during term time except under ‘exceptional circumstances’. Yet Miss Pankhania was given permission to take a month off by governors ‘because she has worked extremely hard’. The 30-year-old, who writes of the ‘importance of respect, good manners’ and ‘high standards’ on the school’s website, will be on leave from April 28 – the first day back at school after Easter. Vina Pankhania with her fiance Amit Jain. Miss Pankhania refused to comment and would not say why she had organised her wedding during term time . Getting married: Headteacher Vina Pankhania has been given a month off during term time . She is returning to work on May 23, . three days before the summer half-term holiday starts. Parents reacted . with fury when they received a letter from governors last week telling . them about her plans. One, . Sonya Gilmour, said: ‘As a parent of two boys at Little Hill, I find . this disgusting. How can governors approve leave just after Easter when . parents themselves can be fined for similar actions? Surely the summer . time off she has is big enough to accommodate a wedding.’ Miss Pankhania, 30, has been acting head teacher at the school in Wigston, Leicestershire, for just over two years. Each year she is entitled to 13 weeks’ holiday. Governors have allowed her to take her extra term time holiday . as ‘unpaid leave’ so she can marry fiancé Amit Jain in India in May. While she is away the acting deputy head Helen Cartledge-Splitt will be . in charge of the school, which has about 360 boys and girls, aged four . to ten. Another parent, who . asked not to be named, said Miss Pank-hania was either ‘incredibly . arrogant or naïve’ for talking almost half a term off. ‘Anyone . employed in education gets ample holiday time to arrange weddings and . holidays without needing time off during the term,’ he said. ‘The school refuses to authorise any pupils’ holidays during term and issues letters stating this at regular intervals. One parent said Miss Pankhania was either 'incredibly arrogant or naive' for choosing to take time off during term when the school would not let pupils do the same. Invite: The head has created  thissave the date video, which reveals despite the time off in term time she is getting married on the bank holiday weekend . Message: Miss Pankhania's school has said it granted the time off because she had 'worked hard' ‘I . feel the school has set a precedent and will be unable to enforce the . policy applying to pupils or, indeed, any of the staff.’ Miss Pankhania refused to comment. In . a statement, the governors said: ‘Staff are usually required to take . leave during school holidays. However, we have approved the acting head . teacher’s request for unpaid leave to get married because she has worked . extremely hard over the past two years, including during school . holidays, to bring stability to our school. Anger: Parents with children at Little Hill Primary in Wigston say the decision is 'disgusting' and 'arrogant' ‘Her deputies will cover her duties and this will not disrupt teaching. The majority of parents have wished her well.’ Children at the school used to be allowed up to ten days off during term time a year if there were ‘special circumstances’. Now they are only allowed time off during term time under ‘exceptional circumstances’. Parents . who take their child out of school in term can be fined £60, which . increases to £120 if it is not paid within 28 days. Failure to pay can . result in court action. The . National Association of Head Teachers said: ‘It is inappropriate for us . to comment on individual cases but the governing body of any school . would carefully consider the facts before granting leave during term . time.’ Last week a Lancashire school threatened a mother with . court after her daughters missed class to spend time with their terminally . ill father. Teenagers . Lydia and Leah Vaughan were last week at the bedside of their dying . father, Martin, 40, after he was rushed to hospital after his cancer . spread. But their mother Nicolette was then sent a letter by their school threatening legal action for unauthorised absences. She . had kept Bispham High School in Blackpool, Lancashire, informed of her . husband's illness since his first diagnosis in 2010 and had told them it . had spread to his liver and was terminal. But the school still sent out the threatening letter and have since apologised for their heavy-handed approach. Bereft:  Lydia and Leah with their father Martin who has been battling cancer, which's now spread to his liver . Last month it emerged a couple had been fined a total of almost £1,000 by magistrates after taking their three children away. Stewart and Natasha . Sutherland from Telford, Shropshire, remained defiant afterwards, saying the penalty, on top of . the cost of the holiday, was still cheaper than going away during the . school break. They returned home from the week-long break to Rhodes – their first family holiday in five years – to find they had been fined £360. This was soon doubled to £720 because they did not pay up quickly enough. The case went to a magistrates court where the Sutherlands were forced to enter a guilty plea. Their fine was amended to £630 with £300 costs and a £63 victim surcharge. Speaking after the case, Mr Sutherland, said: ‘We had no choice but to plead guilty otherwise me and my wife could have been behind bars'. Defying the law: Stewart and Natasha Sutherland were fined £1,000 for taking their three children abroad during term time . Last summer it emerged a mother was fined £400 because . her son missed a day of school nearly nine years ago because he had . severe headaches as a result of an undiagnosed brain tumour. Darilyn . Rothwell, 51, from Radcliffe, Manchester, was given just seven days to . pay the fine which was issued because her 24-year-old son Chris Barlow . was off sick when he was a teenager in November 2004. She . claims she had informed the school that her son, who had to take . several sick days in the months before his diagnosis, was ill but she . was fined for his 'truancy' anyway. Upset: The fine has been upsetting for Mrs Rothwell as it has also brought back bad memories of her son's battle with cancer . Mr Barlow, who now has three children . of his own, collapsed with seizures in January 2005 and was on a life . support machine for three days at Royal Bolton Hospital. He was diagnosed with a brain tumour and underwent numerous operations. Mrs . Rothwell was taken to court by Bolton Council later that year after . education bosses claimed she was not doing enough to get her son back to . lessons at Harper Green School in Farnworth after his treatment.","Vina Pankhania allowed unpaid leave as reward for 'working hard'

"By . Arthur Martin . and Lizzie Edmonds . Dave Lee Travis said his ‘nightmare is continuing’ yesterday after being told he will face a new allegation of indecent assault. The former Radio 1 star was cleared last month of carrying out 12 sex attacks involving young women, at the end of a high-profile six-week trial. The Crown Prosecution Service then announced Travis would be retried over two allegations on which the jury had failed to agree. Dave Lee Travis is to be charged with a further count of indecent assault, Southwark Crown Court has heard . Former Radio 1 DJ Dave Lee Travis, pictured with his wife Marianne Griffin, arrives at Southwark Crown Court in February when it was announced he would face a retrial on charges of indecent assault and sexual assault . The first concerns an alleged assault on a stage hand when the DJ was appearing in Aladdin in Crawley, West Sussex, in 1990. The second relates to an alleged attack on a journalist interviewing him in his home in November 2008. Yesterday . the 68-year-old DJ wiped away tears in court after being told the new . charge will be added. He is expected to face a fresh trial later this . year. Outside Southwark . Crown Court, Travis – real name David Griffin – said: ‘It has been a bit . of a nightmare. The only thing I want to say is that the nightmare is . continuing.’ The new charge relates to an alleged assault on a young woman when Travis appeared on The Mrs Merton Show on the BBC in 1995. It . was also revealed that a further two women have come forward over the . past three months with fresh claims against the former Top Of The Pops . presenter. Trial: A court sketch shows Dave Lee Travis at Southwark Crown Court during his trial in January . One allegation . will be heard as evidence in any forthcoming trial, rather than being . added as a separate criminal charge, because the alleged offence took . place outside British jurisdiction. The other allegation has been . dropped. Travis was arrested . in 2012 by police officers from Operation Yewtree, the investigation . into historic sex crimes sparked by the death of Jimmy Savile. The . investigation has already cost £2.7million, of which £490,000 has been . paid to the 30-strong detective team. The . DJ’s original six-week trial is estimated to have cost around £300,000, . while the second trial may cost another £150,000. Travis had to sell . his £1million house in Mentmore, Buckinghamshire, to pay for his legal . fees for the first trial. He . appeared in court yesterday wearing a suit, black coat and a red scarf, . and accompanied by Marianne his Swedish-born wife of 40 years. He . held his head in his hands, took his glasses off and wiped his eyes as . prosecutor Miranda Moore QC announced the decision to bring a new charge . against him. ‘Mr Griffin . will be charged on a further offence of indecent assault relating to a . young woman,’ she said. ‘He can either go with the officers to the . police station this afternoon or he can be summonsed.’ The veteran DJ, who was cleared of 12 counts in February, pictured hosting Top of the Pops in August 1978 . The . charge comes in wake of a series of blows for the £2.7million Operation . Yewtree - the police investigation into a series of sexual abuse claims . against the late Jimmy Savile and other high profile individuals, . including Travis. Earlier this week, charges against comedian Jimmy Tarbuck were dropped. Similarly, . Jim Davidson was arrested on January 2 last year on suspicion of sexual . offences. The 60-year-old Big Brother winner was later told he would . not face further action. As he left court, Travis said he wanted to draw attention to the fact that today was the 50th birthday of Radio Caroline - the offshore radio station where he started his career. He went on: 'I’d like to take the opportunity to wish all my colleagues in the radio and the music business a happy day, and spend some time remembering what it used to be like in the music business when it was actually quite enjoyable.' Travis was previously accused of indecently assaulting 10 women and sexually assaulting another in alleged incidents - which dated back to 1976 when he was at the height of his fame. The jury of eight women and four men deliberated for more than 20 hours before finding him not guilty of 12 indecent assault charges. But they were not able to agree on a charge of alleged indecent assault against a woman in the early 1990s along with an alleged sexual assault in 2008.

"By . Arthur Martin . It was the most devastating pandemic in human history. But 25 skeletons discovered by railway engineers beneath London suggest the Black Death was even more lethal than previously thought. After analysing the teeth of the corpses, scientists believe the bubonic plague – spread by the bites of infected fleas living on black rats – mutated into a more virulent strain that passed easily from human to human. New theory: Analysis of skeletons discovered in London believed to be victims of the Black Death suggests the disease was not spread by rat fleas, but was in fact airborne . DNA of plague bacteria taken from the 25 skeletons discovered in Clerkenwell was compared to samples from a recent outbreak in Madagascar which killed 60 people . The remains were discovered during excavations of Charterhouse Square in Farringdon, London, an area of the capital left largely undisturbed for years . This 'pneumonic' form of plague . infected the lungs of sufferers, meaning they could spread the disease . simply by coughing – fatal in medieval Europe's crowded cities. It also . had a much lower survival rate and could kill within 24 hours. The . outbreak claimed the lives of around 75million people in the 14th . century. The researchers say only the more contagious strain can explain . why so many died. Among the . victims was Edward III's daughter, Joan, who sailed to Europe to marry . the heir to the Spanish throne of Castile. She died of the plague within . ten days of arriving. The . new findings, revealed in Channel 4 documentary Secret History: Return . of the Black Death, which will air on Sunday, emerged after engineers . working on the Crossrail project discovered 25 skeletons while digging . 26 miles of tunnels beneath the capital. They . were found close to Smithfield Market last year, in neat rows on two . levels sealed under a layer of clay. Thousands of bodies are thought to . have been interred at an emergency burial site there. Teeth . from 12 of the skeletons were sent for analysis and four tested . positive for Yersinia pestis. The deadly bacterium is responsible for . both bubonic and pneumonic plague. But the researchers concluded that . the bubonic strain could not have had the devastating impact seen during . the Black Death. Dr Tim . Brooks, an expert in infectious diseases at Public Health England, said: . 'As an explanation for the Black Death in its own right, [bubonic . plague is] simply not good enough. The researchers were shocked to discover that the two samples were an almost perfect match, meaning the 14th century plague was no more virulent than it is today . The DNA samples, which were extracted from the molar teeth of the skeletons, have also revealed intriguing details of the victims' lives . Don Walker, an osteologist with the Museum of London with one of the 25 skeletons found by construction workers under central London's Charterhouse Square last year . 'It . cannot spread fast enough from one household to the next to cause the . huge number of cases that we saw during the Black Death epidemics.' He . added: 'In a small number of people … the organism will spread to their . lungs and they will then develop a pneumonia. It is that critical . switch, that if there were enough people in contact with them, that . allows it to spread as a pneumonic plague.' Fellow . researcher Don Walker, of the Museum of London Archaeology, said the . pneumonic form was 'more lethal', adding: 'There was no chance of . recovery.' Bring out your dead: The Black Death decimated the population of Britain in the mid 14th century killing an estimated six of 10 Londoners . The new finding have come from comparing DNA from teeth of the skeletons to samples from a recent plague outbreak in Madagascar . The excavation work was being carried out in order to make way for the new Crossrail train line . Six out of 10 bodies analysed were born and bred in London. But four had come from further afield - presumably seeking work - from the South East of England, central England or the East of England and one from northern England or Scotland . The remains also revealed that one of the bodies could have been that of a monk - after showing signs of vegetarianism in later life, which is something a Carthusian monk would have done during the 14th century . Archaeologist Jay Carver said: 'Analysis of the Crossrail find has revealed an extraordinary amount of information allowing us to solve a 660-year mystery' Crossrail's lead archeologist Jay Carver inspecting one of the 25 skeletons, left. Research has shown that the burial ground was established in 1348 .","Scientists have been examining skeletons of plague victims unearthed in Clerkenwell, London .

"By . Arthur Martin . Victim: PC Blakelock was hacked to death on Tottenham's Broadwater Farm Estate in 1985 . A gang member paid £5,000 for his eye-witness account of Keith Blakelock’s murder told a court yesterday he kicked the officer ten times during the 1985 Tottenham riots. The witness, giving evidence under the pseudonym John Brown, admitted being part of a gang that repeatedly kicked and stabbed the policeman as he lay on the ground. PC Blakelock was stabbed 43 times by a baying mob shouting ‘kill the pig’ as he tried to protect firemen. A knife was embedded in his neck in a failed attempt to decapitate him. The officer ‘was trying to curl up into a ball’ in an attempt to protect himself and screamed ‘help, help, help’, said Mr Brown. The witness’s role in the attack would usually mean he would be prosecuted for murder, the Old Bailey heard. But he received immunity from prosecution, was paid £5,000 and was helped with his rent, phone and car bills after he assisted police in 1993 during a second investigation into PC Blakelock’s murder. Giving evidence from behind a screen and with his voice distorted to protect his identity, Mr Brown said he saw Nicholas Jacobs stabbing the policeman with a machete during the riots. Mr Brown, a former member of the mainly white Park Lane Boys gang, said: ‘I saw him hit a couple of blows on the officer in the shoulder. He was just stabbing up and down with the machete. I saw him do it between two and four times.’ He said he saw a sword, a 15in dagger and the machete allegedly wielded by Jacobs during the ‘frantic’ attack. ‘As he was brought to the ground I started kicking him. I kicked him in the ribs around ten times. I had trainers on,’ said Mr Brown. Asked by prosecutor Richard Whittam QC why he kicked PC Blakelock, Mr Brown said: ‘I don’t know. I just rushed in. It was the excitement of the situation. Tributes: Flowers left at the scene where PC Blakelock was hacked to death by dozens of men armed with everything from machetes to kitchen knives during riots at Broadwater Farm estate in 1985 . Aftermath: Police look at the devastation following the 1985 riots in the Broadwater Farm area of Tottenham . 'I noticed an officer being pulled to . the ground by a couple of individuals. His helmet was knocked off. I . didn’t see where it went. Then it was a free for all. ‘They were shouting things  like, “kill the beasty”, “kill the Babylon”, “get his f****** head on a pole” and “kill the pig”.’ Mr . Brown, who was 20 at the time of the riots, described seeing one . attacker with a long sword stabbing the top half of PC Blakelock’s body . and another stabbing the officer with a short dagger twice in the ribs. He told the jury he was carrying a stick on the night of the murder but had not used it. After the riots Mr Brown pleaded guilty to affray and burglary and was jailed for five years, later cut to 42 months on appeal. Court: With his voice disguised by digital distortion equipment, the prosecution witness told jurors at the Old Bailey (pictured) that he was armed with a stick during the violence on the Broadwater Farm Estate . He . gave evidence against Jacobs when he was tried for affray in 1986, . placing him at the scene but making no mention  of the knife. It was not until 1993 that Mr Brown claimed Jacobs attacked PC Blakelock with a machete. Defence . barrister Courtenay Griffiths QC accused Mr Brown of telling ‘blatant . lies’ and ‘fitting up’ Jacobs so he could get a financial reward. Mr . Griffiths also accused him of colluding with his cousin and an old . friend – two other key prosecution witnesses – to frame Jacobs. Mr Brown . denied the allegations. Jacobs, 45, of Hackney, East London, denies murder. The trial continues.

The elderly are being put off visiting Britain’s town and city centres because of a lack of public toilets and places to sit, a study has found. Failings in the design and planning of centres are deterring older people from venturing in. Campaigners said they are being made to feel ‘left behind by society’. Researchers asked a group of older people with differing levels of mobility to recount their experiences of a visit to Leeds. The participants, who were mainly in . their late 60s and 70s, were asked to pinpoint aspects that made their . experience in shops, streets and markets and on public transport both . easier and more difficult. For many, the basic difficulty of getting around the city over-rode any positive aspects they reported. Several complained that a lack of public lavatories was a major obstacle to their enjoyment of the city. Others, . including some suffering from conditions such as asthma, complained . that there had been little consideration of the need for benches and . seats to enable them to take short breaks as they walked around. They described the seats that were available as ‘uninviting’ and were arranged in a way that tended to be isolating. The findings were presented in a . research paper by a team of design, transport experts and engineers at . Leeds University. The authors highlighted how simple problems such as a . shortage of seating in streets or a lack of post boxes are deterring . many older people from venturing into city centres. They . urged councils and retailers to work together to make simple changes to . avoid excluding the fastest-growing section of Britain’s population . from the heart of major towns and cities. Dr . Kishore Budha, the lead author of the report, said: ‘For older people . there are simple things like toilets and seating which seem to be . completely forgotten. Study: Researchers asked a group of older people with differing levels of mobility to recount their experiences of a visit to Leeds . ‘The participants noticed that even in . new shopping centres with excellent modern disabled access, the . lavatories were often situated on the third or fourth floor. We seem to . get the whole thing wrong. It appears that the provision of ramps and . lifts is enough and that we have ticked the box. ‘Subtly . what this is saying is “don’t use this as a public facility, we will . make it difficult for you to use the toilets in the built environment”.’ Mervyn . Kohler, who carries out similar surveys for Age UK, said: ‘This is . increasing [older people’s] sense of being left behind by society, which . regards them as “past it”. ‘That sense of being a second-class citizen is something that a lot of older people feel quite bitter about. ‘If . that impacts on their ability to enjoy life and get out and socialise . and get about independently, then we are eroding their quality of life . in a serious way.'

"By . Arthur Martin . Victim: Pc Keith Blakelock was murdered after he was ambushed by an armed mob yelling 'kill the pig', a court heard today . Constable Keith Blakelock was stabbed more than 40 times and almost decapitated by a mob screaming ‘kill the pig’ during the 1985 Tottenham riots, a court heard yesterday. The police officer was beaten and stabbed ‘without mercy’ by up to 20 rioters as he lay helpless on the floor, it was said. Details of the ‘ferocious’ murder – in which a knife was left embedded in his neck – emerged on the first day of PC Blakelock’s murder trial yesterday. Nicholas Jacobs, 45, is accused of murdering the policeman during the riots 29 years ago when he was 16. The Old Bailey heard that the 1985  riots had a ‘more sinister edge’ than  those of 2011 because some rioters ‘appeared to have as their target the death of a police officer’. The riots broke out a day after the death of Cynthia Jarrett, who suffered a heart attack when officers searched her home looking for evidence against her son. PC Blakelock was in a group of 11 officers who were attacked on the Broadwater Farm Estate in Tottenham, North London, on October 6, 1985. They were attempting to protect firemen who were trying to put out fires when an armed mob surrounded them. Fearing they were about to become trapped by a much larger group of thugs, the officers and firefighters ran for safety. As they fled, PC Blakelock and PC Richard Coombes fell and were immediately attacked by rioters shouting: ‘Kill the pig.’ Allegations: Richard Whittam QC (right) told the Old Bailey Nicholas . Jacobs (centre) was armed and part of an armed mob which stabbed Pc Blakelock to death . Victim: PC Blakelock's widow Elizabeth Johnson, arrives at the Old Bailey in London today. Her husband, right, was murdered during violent clashes in Tottenham, north London, in October 1985 . Family: Elizabeth Johnson was accompanied to the Old Bailey by sons Lee, Kevin and Mark Blakelock (left to right) Prosecutor Richard Whittam QC said PC . Coombes suffered serious injuries and ‘was very fortunate to survive’. He added: ‘PC Blakelock did not. The attack on him was without mercy. ‘He was beaten and stabbed to death before his colleagues were able to force the attackers away. ‘PC . Blakelock suffered something in excess of 40 stab type injuries and . there appears to have been an attempt made to decapitate him. ‘The attack left him with a knife embedded in his neck. ‘That was recovered from his body at the post-mortem examination. ‘He had many cuts to his arms and caused by bladed weapons as he tried to defend himself from the mob.’ Mr Whittam said Jacobs, known as  Nicky, was part of an ‘inner circle’ of  up to 20 rioters who kicked and stabbed PC Blakelock. He said that Jacobs ‘was armed with a bladed weapon and he used it as part of the joint attack’. Suspect: Flanked by prison officers, Nicholas Jacobs (left) was at the Old Bailey in London where he is standing trial for the murder of the policeman 28 years ago . Support: Protesters outside the Old Bailey, as Nicholas Jacobs stands trial today for murder during the Broadwater Farm riots in Tottenham in October 1985 . Denial: Last year Nicholas Jacobs was pictured with a sign denying the murder of the police officer in 1985 . ‘There is no dispute that PC Blakelock was murdered,’ Mr Whittam said. ‘There is no dispute that Nicky Jacobs was involved in the public disorder that night, as were some of the witnesses. ‘Nicky . Jacobs is the sole person on trial. He is on trial for the murder of PC . Blakelock.’ The officer’s widow Elizabeth Johnson and their sons Lee, . Kevin and Mark sat stoically in court as details of the murder emerged. The 1985 Tottenham riots erupted the day after a man was arrested in connection with a suspected stolen vehicle tax disc. When . officers searched the man’s home address, his mother, Mrs Jarrett, died . from a heart attack, ‘fuelling further the existing community . tensions’. ‘Many members of the local community believed that the police . were responsible for the death,’ Mr Whittam told the jury. Aftermath: Police watch the devastation following the riots in Tottenham, North London where a mob stabbed PC Blakelock to death on Broadwater Farm estate . Disorder: Police on the Broadwater Farm estate in Tottenham, north London, during the riots in which Pc Keith Blakelock was stabbed to death . Tributes: Police officers inspect floral tributes left for PC Blakelock close to where he was killed . Funeral: PC Keith Blakelock's coffin, draped in the blue Metropolitan Police flag, is carried by six policemen into St James' Church, Muswell Hill, north London . ‘The . anger and grief of the family and friends of Mrs Jarrett spread to . other members of the community and a demonstration was planned to take . place outside Tottenham police station on Sunday, October 6.’ About 300 people were convicted of public order offences after the riot, jurors were told. Mr . Whittam told the jury of seven men and five women that there had been . two investigations into the murder before the current one. The first . inquiry in 1985 resulted in three juveniles and three adults being . charged for murder. The case against the juveniles was dropped and all . three adults were convicted on March 1987. Their . convictions were quashed by the Court of Appeal in 1991 after doubts . over the authenticity of notes taken during police interviews emerged. Two detectives were prosecuted over failings in the investigation, but . they were acquitted at the Old Bailey. Jacobs, of Hackney, East London, denies murder. The trial continues.

"By . Luke Garratt . and Chris Greenwood . and Arthur Martin . Hundreds of police officers swooped on addresses across London and the Home Counties yesterday in an operation aimed at smashing one of Britain’s most notorious crime gangs. Senior members of the Adams syndicate were among 15 people arrested as officers dressed in riot gear descended on 25 properties. Almost £300,000 in cash, designer watches, a handgun, shotguns and other weapons were recovered after years of painstaking investigation. Police, dressed in full assault gear, prepare raid an address in north London, one of the 22 houses raided that are thought to be hubs for the notorious London criminal gang . Raided: 22 homes serving as bases for an 'established and high profile' criminal gang in north London . Several business addresses were also . raided, including solicitors, accountants and property consultants . suspected of laundering money. At . one safety deposit box in Central London police officers discovered . £25,000 and a stash of expensive watches. In another property, a hidden . safe held £100,000. Scotland . Yard is desperate to land a decisive blow on the Adams syndicate, which . has influence worldwide and has a reputation for extreme violence. It . has been connected to at least 25 murders. Police . suspect members of drug trafficking, extortion and hijacking but in . recent years they have moved into white-collar and high-tech crime, . including mortgage fraud. A specialist police team, codenamed Operation Octopod, has been carrying out surveillance. A man is arrested and led of of one of the raided addresses . Detectives believe they have amassed evidence of conspiracy to assault, money laundering, fraud and revenue offences. The raids were carried out under Proceeds of Crime Act legislation, which investigators hope could help finally smash the gang. One of the properties raided was the £2.5million Clerkenwell mansion owned by Tommy Adams, 55, and his wife Androulla, 54. Tommy, . who once led the syndicate with his brothers Terry and Patrick, was . jailed for seven and half years in 1998 after admitting his role in an . £8million cannabis smuggling plot. Neighbours . knew him as a ‘businessman with a mysterious past’. One said: ‘Tommy is . a man that no one would ever ask him anything about what he did.’ Terry, . 59, who was not arrested yesterday, has already served a seven-year . sentence for money laundering. He was sent back to prison shortly after . his release for failing to declare an expensive ‘post-prison makeover’ arranged by his wife at a luxury Hertfordshire hotel. There . is evidence that members of the Adams family have escaped prosecution . by infiltrating the police and Crown Prosecution Service. Most of the . 200 officers involved in yesterday’s operation were not told the . identities of the targets over fears that the information could be . leaked. At one garden flat in Highgate, North London, police seized a 24-year-old man believed to be a key figure in the group. Officers broke through his front door – protected by an iron grille – using a steel battering ram just before 6am. Det . Chief Supt Tom Manson, of the Met, said the operation aimed to . ‘dismantle’ the gang. ‘This gang has believed they were untouchable but . we are determined to prove they are not,’ he said. ‘The . links between this gang and serious and violent crime are well . documented, as is their strong influence across London, and, we believe, . connections to criminals across Britain and Europe.’ The . family crime business, known to many as the ‘A Team’, was also . suspected of links to the Russian mafia and the powerful Columbian . cocaine cartels. Solicitors, accountants and investment advisers with links to the notorious gang were ordered to hand over documents under the proceeds of crime act, so they could be examined by financial investigators. One of the suspected gang members is taken in by police, led out of the house in north London. The raids were the result of months of planning and building evidence against the suspected criminal gang . A man is led out of a north London home in Clerkenwell by police. In addition to arrests, police confiscated £300,000 of cash and luxury items, and a series of guns . Some of the solicitors and financial . advisors were also taken in for questioning on suspicion that they . helped to run the finances of the gang as mortgage brokers and property . developers. The massive . hit against the gang was launched after detectives apparently uncovered . evidence of crimes including conspiracy to assault, money laundering, . fraud and revenue offences. The . money confiscated totalled around £275,000 in cash, collected in safes . and safety deposit boxes, in addition to luxury items like Rolexes, and . computers and phones, which were used for financial correspondence. Scotland Yard said at one property they found a safe £100,000 'tucked inside'. The . operation was part of a Scotland Yard case against the gang, which has . taken months of detectives following money trails to link the properties . with the gang's criminal gains. While Scotland Yard did not name the criminal ring, which is also known as the . A Team, they did call it 'one of the UK's longest established and high . profile organised crime gangs'. Detective Chief Superintendent Tom Manson of the MPS Specialist, Organised and Economic Crime Command, said: 'We believe we have arrested members of the most long established and high profile crime gang in London. Tommy Adams, (pictured in an older handout for a previous conviction) patriarch and financier of the Adams gang - Described in court as a 'notorious gangster', is also believed to have been arrested as a part of targeted raids on a criminal gang . 'This was a painstaking investigation and a discreet operation run by specialist officers until today when the combined resources of the Met were deployed on the arrest phase of the operation. 'The links between this gang and serious and violent crime are well documented as is their strong influence across London, and, we believe, connections to criminals across Britain and Europe. 'We believe they are responsible for a multi-million pound criminal business; laundering the profits from crime and using this money to commit other money-spinning offences. 'This is cash which can be used to fund further crime and provide luxurious lifestyles. 'For too long organised gangs have used advances in technology that have allowed them to hide their criminal gains and some even believe they can escape justice by bribing those who enforce the law. 'This operation and others like it are the Met's response. 'Any criminal gang operating in London needs to know that we will tackle them head on and hit them where it hurts most, by seizing their cash and assets.' The list of people arrested during the raids, where they were arrested, and their charges is as follows: . All are being held at a central London police station while searches continue. Since 2012, the Metropolitan Police Service has restrained, forfeited and confiscated over £62million in criminal cash and assets under the Proceeds of Crime Act of 2002.

"By . Arthur Martin . At the age of 11 Michael McConville . watched a gang of masked IRA terrorists smash down the door of his . family's West Belfast home and demanded to see his mother Jean. They dragged her through the door as her children clung on to her legs and tried to fight the gunmen off. It was the last time they saw their mother alive. A . week later, a man who identified himself as being from the IRA called . at the McConvilles' council home. He handed the children their mother's . purse and wedding ring, saying: 'I was told to deliver this.' Jean McConville (left) with three of her children before she vanished in 1972 . Helen McKendry holds a family photograph showing her mother Jean McConcille, at home in Killyleagh, Northern Ireland . Unbeknown . to her ten children, Jean McConville had been taken to a beach with her . hands tied behind her back and shot through the back of her head. Since then Michael and his other siblings have lived in the hope that one day the murders would be brought to justice. Then . in 2003 her remains were accidentally discovered at a beach in County . Louth in 2003. Tests showed she had been shot in the back of the head. The discovery proved to be a key turning point in her children's quest for the truth. Jean . McConville was abducted from her council flat off the Catholic Falls . Road in 1972 when neighbours informed IRA leaders she was a British . sympathiser after she was seen comforting a soldier shot and wounded . outside her home. Soon after her act of kindness to the soldier, Mrs McConville was beaten and found wandering the streets dazed and bleeding. Gerry Adams, president of Sinn Fein, speaking at a conference in London .

But they did not have time to heal. Less . than 24 hours later, more than a dozen figures, some wearing . bala-clavas, arrived at the McConville family home and burst through the . door demanding to see 'mammy'. She . became one of the so-called 'Disappeared', of whom there were at least . 16 IRA murder victims who had been buried at secret locations. Helen McKendry (right) and Agnes McConville, daughters of Jean McConville walk along hand in hand waiting for news near the second burial place at Templeton Beach car park in 2003 . A . decision was taken by the IRA in 1972 to stop dumping the mutilated . bodies of alleged traitors on the streets of Belfast as a grim warning . to others. With . a new breed of younger, 'modernising' figures emerging within the IRA, . epitomised by the bespectacled Adams, it was decided that execut-ed . 'traitors' would be quietly disposed of in bogs and beaches along . Ire-land's coastline. Amid . IRA fears that the family might go to the police, the then 11-year-old . Michael was abducted by terrorist thugs himself. He was beaten and had a . gun held to his head until he agreed he had not seen his mother being . abducted. The children fended for themselves until Michael and a younger brother were caught stealing food.They confessed all to police — and the children were promptly split up and put in different care homes. Irish Police silhouetted against the evening sky at Templetown Beach car park in Co Louth . In . an interview with the Mail recently, Michael, now 52, said the . inter-vening years had destroyed the lives of his siblings, who had been . tor-tured by memories and had sought escape in drink or drugs. 'Time . doesn't heal,' he said. 'The pain doesn't go away. It has destroyed us. There is not a day that goes by when I don't ask myself why I didn't do . more. I know I was just a wee boy, but I still ask myself if I could . have saved her. 'They . took my mother from her house. To bring her down to a beach with her . hands tied behind her back and to put a gun to the back of her head and . shoot her — that was a war crime and the people responsible should be . brought to The Hague [before the war crimes court].

He . added: 'At the time all we had was each other. But I saw my brothers . and sisters only about four or five times in the next six years. It was a . nightmare. We became strangers to each other. Everybody has had their . problems in different ways.' When . the IRA eventually confessed to abducting and killing her, they claimed . it was because she was a 'tout' who was passing information to the . British Army. The . McConville family has always insisted that their mother's only . in-volvement with the Army was that she once gave succour to an injured . squaddie. Last . year Jean's children received a huge breakthrough when 11 clandes-tine . tapes recorded by Republican and Loyalist paramilitaries, which had . languished for ten years in the archives of the Burns Library in Bos-ton . College in the US, were handed over to the Police Service of North-ern . Ireland. They . include an admission from Dolores Price, one of the IRA's most . in-famous terrorists, that she ferried Michael's 37-year-old mother to . the Irish Republic where she was tortured, tied up and shot in the head. And she asserted it was Gerry Adams who sanctioned the murder. Price . refused to enlarge on why Adams ordered Mrs McConville's execu-tion, . but commented: 'You don't deserve to die if you are an unpleasant . person, as she was, but you do deserve to die if you are an informer. Par-ticularly in a war. That is the Republican way.' For the McConville children, their mother's death blighted their lives for ever. But perhaps now justice is at last in sight for them.

"By . Arthur Martin . and Harriet Arkell . Pan’s People pin-up Dee Dee Wilde told a court yesterday that Dave Lee Travis was a ‘pussycat’ with whom she felt ‘very safe’. Wearing leopard-print stiletto heels, the 67-year-old said Travis was a ‘big bear of a man’ who would often give her cuddles. She said she never witnessed any inappropriate behaviour from the former Radio 1 DJ, 68, who is accused of indecent and sexual assault. Former Pan's People dancer Patricia 'Dee Dee' Wilde - pictured yesterday (left), and in her youth (right) - told the court that unlike Jimmy Savile, whom she found 'very creepy', Dave Lee Travis was 'an absolute pussycat' Miss Wilde said that dancers were used to men being over-familiar but said she had no trouble from Travis . However, she said some of his . colleagues did make her feel uncomfortable, including Jimmy Savile who . would lick her hand as he kissed it. Miss . Wilde, a founding member of the dance troupe Pan’s People in 1966, was a . regular on Top Of The Pops when Travis was presenting. Travis (pictured yesterday outside court) was a 'big pussycat' and a 'lovely man', Miss Wilde said . Giving evidence at Southwark Crown Court, she said: ‘When I first met Dave I thought “what a lovely man he is”. ‘The . thing about Dave is, he is a big bear of a man. If he came up and gave . you a cuddle you felt very safe with him, unlike other DJs. He was a . pussycat. He was a consummate professional, totally together. ‘For . a DJ, the profile of being  on Top Of The Pops was very  important so . you did your best  on it. I think Dave was one of the most gentlemanly . and nicest DJs who appeared.’ When . asked if she had witnessed any inappropriate behaviour by Travis, she . replied: ‘Absolutely never. Because we were there 52 weeks of the year, . we were on the premises so frequently, if something had gone on we would . have heard about it. ‘There were a couple of DJs and a producer, who I won’t name, who were always mentioned. ‘If . something had gone on it spread like wildfire, but never once did I . hear anyone say Dave had behaved in an inappropriate manner.’ Miss Wilde said Travis’s behaviour was in stark contrast to Savile’s. ‘I didn’t like him at all, he was creepy,’ she said. ‘As . a woman I didn’t feel like comfortable in his presence. He would pick . up your hand and kiss it and lick it at the same time, quite revolting. ‘As . a young dancer you just got on with it. It was very different in those . days. Things that were acceptable then are not acceptable now.’ Earlier, . Elisabeth Birks told the court how Travis had taken naked photographs . of her in his home in 2010 while her husband sat in another room. Travis . met the musician at a charity event in south-west London, and asked if . he could take her picture after he spotted a tattoo on her back. She said Travis was ‘very, very professional, very polite’ and made her ‘feel very comfortable’. An . ex-BBC producer also told jurors how Travis and his fellow DJs were . frequently mobbed by young female fans, who were dubbed ‘trainspotters’ by Corporation staff. Pan's People danced on Top of the Pops when the songs' original artists were not there to perform them live - Dee Dee Wilde is shown second left . Miss Wilde, shown far right, performing with Pan's People in the 1970s, said Travis was 'a big bear of a man' Timothy . Blackmore MBE, giving  evidence in defence of Travis, said: ‘There was . an enormous amount of excitement when Radio 1 was launched. For the . first time, young people could listen to pop music all day long. 'It was very different in those days. Things that were acceptable then are not acceptable now' Dee Dee Wilde . ‘The . result was many of the DJs became elevated in the national . consciousness to practically the same level as the people whose music . they were playing. ‘There . was always a crowd outside the headquarters of Radio 1. They were asking . for autographs most of the time or to have their photos taken. There . was a great deal of enthusiasm to meet their heroes. ‘I . remember trying to rescue Tony Blackburn from a crowd and I had a very . hairy drive to get Noel Edmonds away from a crowd who wanted to tear . every limb from his body.’ Travis, . of Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, who is being tried under his real name . of Dave Griffin, denies 13 counts of indecent assault and one of sexual . assault.

"By . Arthur Martin . and Gerri Peev . On the beach: Bob Crow relaxes in Rio as part of his £10,000 holiday . Bob Crow is facing a mounting backlash for masterminding two crippling rail strikes during a lavish £10,000 holiday. The £145,000-a-year union chief has been accused of making empty promises over talks to avert the walkouts. Last week the RMT was issuing statements in his name from London offering to meet the capital’s mayor Boris Johnson to solve the dispute over changes to the Underground. In reality, however, the firebrand was sunning himself in South America, thousands of miles away. Fresh pictures show him dancing with his girlfriend Nicola Hoarau, 49, on of a cruise ship. In others, the general secretary of the Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers union is seen visiting the statue of Christ the Redeemer in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. But on his return to Britain, he walked into a wall of criticism over the timing and cost of his jaunt. The 53-year-old’s sun-soaked antics will anger some London Underground workers, who will lose out on wages when they begin their first of two 48-hour strikes tomorrow. They will also infuriate millions of commuters from all over the country who will see their trips to the capital disrupted tomorrow and again next week. Nick de Bois, Tory MP for Enfield, said: ‘Bob Crow wants to plunge millions of commuters into travel misery while his only priority seems to have been to plunge himself into a Caribbean swimming pool. I hope his hardworking members will see through his hypocrisy.’ Bob Neill, Tory MP for Bromley and Chislehurst, accused ‘champagne socialist’ Crow of showing contempt for workers. And David Burrowes, Tory MP for Enfield Southgate, questioned how Crow could be ready for personal meetings while he was sunning himself abroad. Last week Crow offered to meet Mr Johnson ‘face to face’ to reach a compromise ahead of the strikes. But he made the offer during his holiday, knowing there would be only one working day to resolve the dispute before the first walk-out. Mr Johnson said last night: ‘Bob Crow is entitled to sun himself silly if likes. What he isn’t entitled to do is to hold London and her hardworking commuters to ransom. 'Call off the strikes Bob, towel off the . sand from between your toes and perhaps then we can talk at City Hall. I . can’t offer you a pina colada but we do a decent cup of municipal . coffee.’ Sightseeing: Crow visits the statue of Christ the Redeemer on Corcovado mountain above Rio de Janeiro . Dance the night away: Crow, centre in black, dances with his girlfriend, in white, by a swimming pool . Thousands of workers are expected to strike for 48 hours from 9.30pm tomorrow and for another 48 hours from 9.30pm on February 11 over plans to close ticket offices. Last week the Mail revealed how Crow, who lives in a council house in Woodford Green, East London, spent two weeks on the lavish cruise from Barbados to Brazil aboard the Silver Spirit liner. His suite included a private balcony and marble bathroom, while guests on the ship could enjoy unlimited champagne and caviar and visit the casino, champagne bar, theatre, and six restaurants. Fellow holidaymakers told how he ‘held court’ on the ship and was first up to sing at a karaoke night. The cruise reportedly cost Crow and his partner more than £7,000. Lobster-red: Crow, reclining on Copacabana beach, works on his tan . At Rio, they checked into the £250-a-night five-star Windsor Atlantic hotel on Copacabana beach before going up Corcovado mountain. On Wednesday Crow was seen turning a deep lobster red after lying in the 104F (40C) heat for three hours. Talks aimed at averting the strikes will be held today at conciliation service Acas. Mr Johnson has offered to hold direct talks with the RMT if the strikes are called off, but Crow said he would meet the mayor face-to-face only if there were ‘no preconditions’.","RMT leader, who earns £145,000 a year, accused of making empty promises .

"By . Steph Cockroft . John Cleese is reportedly set to earn more than £100,000 this year from an app based on one of Monty Python's most iconic sketches. The silly walks app, which will soon hit one million downloads, is based on the sketch The Ministry of Silly Walks. In that scene, which first aired in 1970, Cleese - a civil servant - parades around London doing a 'silly walk'. Scroll down for video . John Cleese, pictured doing the silly walk, is set to make a fortune from an app based on one of Monty Python's most iconic sketches, The Ministry of Silly Walks . The scene, first aired in 1970, sees Cleese -  a civil servant - visiting the fictitious government department which is apparently responsible for developing silly walks through grants . He then visits a ficititious British government ministry which is apparently responsible for developing silly walks through grants. The sketch was reborn earlier this year as a video game, released for Android, iPad and iPhone. The game involves 'silly walking' through the streets of London collecting . coins and power-ups, while avoiding pigeons and other obstacles. The Sun reports that Cleese will now received £100,000 from his share. Creator Chris Curd, master builder at Boondoggle Game Studios, told the paper: 'I effectively developed the game for free and it's doing great so hopefully it can help Mr Cleese.' Cleese often promotes the game on his . official Twitter account, posting his latest score and even challenging fellow . celebrity Stephen Fry to beat it. The comedian divorced his third wife Alyce Faye Eichelberger, pictured left, in a £12m settlement. He is now married to Jennifer Wade, pictured right . On . his official Twitter profile, it says: 'Yes, I am still indeed alive, . contrary to rumour, and am performing the silly walk in my new app.' Th reported sum could go some way to helping pay off the £12m divorce settlement that he reached with his third wife Alyce Faye Eichelberger in 2009. He married his fourth wife Jennifer Wade in 2012. The game, the Ministry of Silly Walks, involves 'silly walking' through London, collecting coins and power-ups, while avoiding pigeons and other obstacles . Cleese recently performed his final Monty Python show along side his fellow actors, Eric Idle, 71, Terry Jones, 72, Terry Gilliam, 73 and Michael Palin, 71. The silly walks sketch . was not performed during Monty Python Live (Mostly) but was instead replaced by The Silly Walks Song. That ws performed by a group of (younger) dancers who mimicked . Cleese's original walks. They also wore bowler hats and carried briefcases, just as Cleese did in the original sketch. The famous sketch involves John Cleese, dressed as a . bowler-hatted civil servant, visiting a fictitious British government ministry . responsible for developing silly walks through grants. Throughout the sketch, Cleese walks in a variety of silly ways. He eventually arrives at his place of business: The . Ministry of Silly Walks. In the . hallway he passes other employees all doing their own silly walks, before arriving at his office. Once there, he finds a man - Michael Palin - waiting for him. He apologises for the delay, explaining that his walk . has become particularly silly and it takes longer for him to . reach his destination. Palin then explains that he has a silly walk . he wishes to develop with grant money. He shows Cleese the walk - but he says it is not particularly silly. He famously said: 'The right leg isn't silly at all, . and the left leg merely does a forward aerial half-turn every alternate . step.' He tells Palin that he does not believe the ministry can help . him, as his walk is not silly enough and funding is short.","Iconic sketch reborn this year as video game for Android, iPad and iPhone .

"By . Steph Cockroft . The images have been used throughout history, to define the bravery of First World War pilots who engaged in aerial combat over European skies. But these stunning photos of the Great War - some of which show more than half a dozen aircrafts engaged in acrobatic dogfights - are actually the work of a crafty fraudster. Despite being published in 1933 in the 'diary' of an anonymous pilot - who apparently took the photos using a camera attached to a machine gun - these impressive images were created by an American model-maker, who pocketed $20,000 through the scam. These images of aerial battle scenes were first published in 1933 by Wesley D Archer in an anonymous diary apparently written by a flying corps pilot. But more than half a century later, experts discovered the images - and the words which went along with it - were actually fake . According to the Telegraph, Wesley D Archer, who served in the RAF, orchestrated the scenes using models of aircrafts which he suspended in the air using 'invisible' string and wires. He later touched up the images, by superimposing other aircrafts onto the scene. The photos were then published in Death in the Air: The War Diary and Photographs of a Flying Corps Pilot. At the time of publication, Mr Archer said the anonymous pilot who wrote the diary could not be named, because he had defied military convention by taking his camera into aerial battle. Mr Archer described in the book's foreword how the photographs had been taken by a camera which was attached to the machine gun of the pilot's aircraft. Dedicating the book to those who had 'survived years of conflict and struggled over enemy lines', Mr Archer said that permission was only given for the photos to be used, on condition of the pilot's anonymity. Mr Archer, who served in the RAF but later became a set-designer and model maker, created the images from his studio using models of aircrafts and 'invisible' string. The scam made him and his wife Betty some $20,000 . After the book's publication, the impressive images were used in books, magazines and newspapers all over the world. But, more than half a century later, it emerged that every photograph  - and the apparently personal words which went along with it - were made up. The scam was first unveiled in 1985 in the Cross and Cockade, the magazine of the Society . of World War 1 Aero Historians. But, because of the magazine's small circulation, the photographs continued to fool the world until the Smithsonian National Air and . Space Museum in Washington DC received documents from a friend of Mr . Archer, after his death. These images, pictured left, were published in Death in the Air: The War Diary and Photographs of a Flying Corps Pilot, pictured right. A spokesman for the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum said it accepted the photographs were fake . While going through his personal documents, the experts came across photo negatives and letter from the 'Cockburn-Lange' collection of photos, which apparently belonged to someone called 'Gladys Maud Cockburn-Lange'. They soon discovered it was a pseudonym for his wife Betty Archer - who had also been in on the scam. Mr Archer died in Cuba in 1955 and his widow four years later, unaware their secret would soon be discovered. Former reconnaissance pilot Jimmy . Taylor, now 91, who served in the RAF during the Second World War, was . one of many who bought Mr Archer's book. The former university lecturer told the Telegraph he had no idea the photos were fake until the scam was revealed. But he said he felt admiration towards Mr Archer for his 'brilliant deception'. A spokesman for the Smithsonian accepted the photographs were faked.","Iconic aerial battle photos first printed in 1933 in anonymous diary of pilot .

"By . Steph Cockroft . Sergeant Reginald Drake, who was believed to be Britain's oldest surviving prisoner of war, has died five days after turning 100 . The man believed to be Britain's oldest surviving prisoner of war, who was held captive at the camp immortalised in The Great Escape, has died five days after turning 100. Sergeant Reginald Drake was one of the few remaining British survivors of the infamous Stalag Luft III camp in Zagan, Poland, where 76 men attempted to escape to their freedom in 1944. The airman was based there for 11 months, during the four years he was held captive by Germans during the Second World War. Sgt Drake was captured in August 1941, after his bomber was shot down and crash-landed in a field during a raid in Rotterdam, Holland. During his captivity, Sgt Drake endured forced marches across Eastern Europe, as the Germans moved prisoners from the Russians who were advancing from the east. The airman, from Norwich, had already had a fortunate escape during the war, when the Allied POWs were strafed by British fighter planes which mistook them for Germans. After the war, Sgt Drake worked as a local government officer. He was in good health until he developed pneumonia shortly before his 100th birthday. He died one week later. It was only after his death that Sgt Drake's family suspected he might be the oldest living POW. The previous oldest surviving prisoner . from the Second World War had been Squadron Leader Alfie Fripp who died . last year, aged 98. Like many other veterans, Sgt Drake . rarely spoke about his experiences of war. But his daughter, Helen . Britton, was able to piece together her father's war records with the . help of the website. The family then approached the military genealogy website, Forces War Records. Mrs Britton, 58, said: 'Over the years my father never really wanted to talk about the war that much. 'He was a very quiet and stoical man and I think that was due to the effect the war had on him. 'But last year we read about Alfie Fripp and we knew that dad was of a similar age to him and that he was a PoW for much of the war as well. 'Before he passed away he told us a little bit about his part in the war and we have managed to find out more information from genealogy website Forces War Records.' Sgt Drake served with 226 Squadron based at RAF Wattisham, Suffolk, and crewed Blenheim bombers on raids on mainland Europe in the aftermath of the Dunkirk evacuation of 1940. Mrs Britton said her father could easily have been killed during the near-miss in 1941, just before he was captured. The airman, from Norwich, was held captive by Germans for four years during the Second World War. He died five days after turning 100, after developing pneumonia . About half of the men, including Sgt . Drake, dived for cover in a ditch on one side of the road. Many of the . men who sheltered on the opposite side were killed. She said: 'He found himself to one side of the crashed plane and he told us he overheard the other two crew members saying 'I think Reg has had it this time'. 'He got up, walked around to the other side of the aircraft and tapped them on the shoulder and said 'I am still here"".' Weeks later, during the raid in Holland, the aircraft in which Sgt Drake was flying made a belly-landing in the field. Although the three-man crew survived, they were all taken prisoner. The captured crew would have then been interrogated for information before being sent to prisoner of war camps. Mrs Britton said: 'I remember when dad and I drove back from a Christmas service at our local church a few years ago and Silent Night had been one of the carols. 'He told me it reminded him of his first Christmas in captivity when they apparently had little food and were frozen and the German guards sang Silent Night outside their cells to taunt them.' Sgt Drake was held captive at Stalag Luft III  for 11 months, from May 1942. The infamous camp was where 'The Great Escape' - the single greatest freedom attempt by POWs in the war - took place . Sgt Drake was moved to Stalag Luft III at Sagan, Poland, in May 1942 where he spent 11 months. In July 1944, he took part in a forced march west from a prison camp at Heydekrug in Lithuania to Thorn in Poland. The marches involved walking for days on end with little or no food, often being beaten or bayoneted by their guards. The previous oldest surviving prisoner from the Second World War was Squadron Leader Alfie Fripp who died last year, aged 98 . Sgt Drake met his wife Vera before the war. They had to wait until 1945 to get married and went on to have three children - Clive, 66, Richard, 63 and Helen - as well as six grandchildren and a great-grandchild. Mrs Britton said: 'I believe that Dad, after all his experiences of war, was very happy to have a wife who he adored, and family, and that providing stability for all of us was the cornerstone of his life.' Tim Hayhoe, managing director of Forces War Records, said: 'Following a lifetime of silence on the subject, Reg Drake's daughter got in touch with us for information that her father had kept to himself. 'We found out the previous oldest PoW died on January 4, 2013 - he was a little over a month older than Reg Drake and the chances of there being anyone else between those two are fairly low.' He aded: 'You can't underestimate the debt this country owes people like Reg. 'After the fall of Dunkirk, bombing raids on mainland Europe were the only way Britain could strike back at Germany for a while until the desert war and the eventual invasion of France. 'Bomber Command was one of the riskiest jobs of the war. Reginald Drake would have seen a lot of colleagues either killed, wounded or taken prisoner when he volunteered for it. 'We're losing a tangible link to the past every time someone like Reg passes away. It's wonderful to think someone who spent five years of his life, at a relatively tender age, suffering deprivation in the hands of the enemy not only survived the war but went on to lead such a long and happy life. 'Now he deserves to be remembered for what he did for the country.' It is thought that Ernest Taylor, from Christow, Devon, is now Britain's oldest POW still alive. Mr Taylor, who was held by the Japanese at the notorious Changi camp in Singapore in World War Two, has just turned 100. The 'Great Escape' from Stalag Luft III was the single greatest freedom attempt by POWs in the war. Among the 50 who were shot was Roger Bushell, the mastermind of the plot which hoped to free over 200 men. Some 26 of the 76 who tried to escape were returned to the camp while three made ‘home runs’ to Britain. The original plan was for three tunnels, codenamed Tom, Dick and Harry.  But Tom was discovered soon after it was started, and it was decided to use Dick to store the spoil from Harry as it was dug. The story of the escape was made into a film in 1963, starring actors Steve McQueen, Charles Bronson and Donald Pleasence. Decades later, the 2000 film Chicken Run was based on the movie.","Sergeant Reginald Drake, from Norwich, held captive by Germans for 4 years .

"By . Steph Cockroft . A dwarf who makes £150 an hour by dressing as an Oompa Loompa or Superman at stag dos and hen parties is facing jail after harassing schoolgirls for sex. Marc Corrieri, 21, who can make £750 per night by being handcuffed to the groom, first messaged a pair of twins on Facebook when they were 15 and asked one to feel 'his third leg'. The 4ft 2in performer, from Motherwell, also sent explicit messages to a 13-year-old girl whom he met at an under 16s disco. Marc Corrieri, 21, from Motherwell, pictured dressed as an Oompa Loompa, is facing jail after harassing schoolgirls as young as 13 for sex. The other men pictured are not involved in the case . He initially offered the girl a job as a face-painter for £50 per day, but soon started asking about her sex life. Corrieri admitted four charges of . sending sexually explicit messages to two 16-year-olds and two . 13-year-olds between May 2011 and August 2012 when he appeared at Hamilton Sheriff Court. The court heard he was caught by police after one girl's mother found the messages and feared her daughter was being groomed. The court heard Corrieri - who did not know any of the girls before he started message them - boasted he was rich and had a flash car. He stopped messaging the twins for a few months - but started with the sexually-explicit messages again once they turned 16. Depute . fiscal Imran Bashir told the court: 'He originally asked the sisters to . go for a walk with him. He sent regular messages but they stopped . abruptly for about six months. Corrieri, who can make £750 per night at stag parties and hen dos, often dresses as Superman as part of his act. There is no suggestion the other men pictured are involved in the case . The performer, pictured left and right in his different guises, contacted a pair of teenage twins over Facebook and asked one to go to the woods to 'feel his third leg' 'When they turned 16 he messaged them again and they described the messages as being a lot more 'creepy' than before. 'He asked one of them how far she had gone with a boy and told her to wear a mini skirt and tights and that he had a fancy car. 'He would message her about five or six . times a day and he made sexual remarks. He told one of them he was now . her boss and she would have to do what he said. He also messaged a 13-year-old offering her a job as a face-painter, after meeting her at an under 16s disco. He then started sending her explicit messages asking about her sex life, the court was told . 'She was worried he would be waiting for her after work.' The court heard Corrieri contacted another 13-year-old and repeatedly asked her what school she went to. The entertainer earns up to £750 in one night, usually by handcuffing himself to grooms during stag parties. Talking about his career, he previously told the Mail: 'It’s a different career. I wanted to have a laugh and I just thought, ""go for it"". Corrieri admitted four charges of sending sexually explicit messages when he appeared at Hamilton Sheriff Court. He will be sentenced next month . 'I get paid to go out and party with different lads, we get a lot of attention from the ladies and I get to enjoy myself. 'I dress up for them [stags] as Superman or as an Oompa Loompa but I draw the line at dressing up as a woman - that’s a no go.' The rules of Corrieri's act include no picking up or throwing, no tampering with his drink, not using the word 'midget' and no police involvement. Corrieri will be sentenced next month.  He has been put on the sex offenders' register.","4ft 2in Marc Corrieri, 21, from Motherwell, is employed as dwarf entertainer .

"By . Steph Cockroft . They are ferocious predators, armed with razor-sharp teeth, who lurk in the depths of the world's largest oceans. So unsuspecting rowers were more than a little shocked when they spotted a shark's fin - in a north London park. The rowers were at a private event on the boating lake in Finsbury Park, when they saw the Great White Shark's fin poking above the surface of the water. Scroll down for video . Boaters were happily enjoying themselves at a private rowing on the boating lake in Finsbury Park, north London, when they spotted something rather unusual in the water . As the boaters relaxed in the north London park, a fin belonging to a Great White Shark suddenly appeared above the surface of the water . One of the guests pointed in disbelief and shouted to his friend as he saw the shark fin move across the water . The creature came uncomfortably close to the rowers' boats, causing a sudden outbreak of panic on the usually-calm lake. One of the rowers shouted 'look at that' as he cowered away from the ominous fin. One of the girls screamed so loudly that the boat nearly toppled over. But, luckily for the rowers, the shark fin was all part of a prank to celebrate Shark Week on Discovery Channel, which starts today. The stunt was set up using a hand-carved polystyrene fin mounted onto a 3m tubular frame, with internal ballast and flotation devices. One of two girls was relaxing on the lake, seemingly unaware the shark fin was coming uncomfortably close to their boat - but her rowing partner suddenly spotted the fin out of the corner of her eye . When the girl finally turned and spotted the ominous fin gliding towards out, she let out a petrified scream . One girl was so frightened when she saw the fin, pictured left, that she almost toppled out of the boat in disbelief. But the girl was soon laughing when she realised the fin - made from polystyrene - was not real, right . These two men cowered away from the water in fear as the fin raced towards their rowing boat . But the men soon peered closer in curiosity once they realised the fin was probably not real . A macabre rowing boat - . with a huge bite taken out of it - was also planted at the scene to add to the eery atmosphere. The prop was created by BAFTA award-winning art director and special effects designer Jamie Campbell. Shark Week, which runs all week, will feature dozens of programmes about the ocean predators. Once the rowers realised the makeshift fin was part of a prank, they relaxed and carried on boating . One of the girls laughed as she spotted the writing on the side of the fin, which revealed the prank was to promote Shark Week on the Discovery Channel . The promotion on the side of the fin reassured boaters that a Great White Shark was not lurking in the lake . Some of the programmes include Airjaws Finding Colossus, in which shark experts Chris Fallows and Jeff Kurr visit the legendary Seal island in South Africa in search of Great Whites. There is also Mythbuster Jawsome - which counts down the 25th biggest shark myths of all time - and Sharkpocalypse, which explores the trend of sharks moving closer to shorelines. The line-up also features Megalodon, which explore the myth around the massive prehistoric shark.","Boaters were rowing on lake during private event in Finsbury Park, London .

"By . Steph Cockroft . David Cruickshank, 30, from Aberdeen, indecently assaulted a teenager while she was having an epileptic fit . A serial rapist indecently assaulted a teenager while she was having an epileptic fit. David Cruickshank, 30, touched the 18-year-old while she was having the seizure in her flat in Aberdeen. The court heard the victim would have been aware of what was going on at the time. Cruickshank, from Aberdeen, was also convicted of raping three underage girls. His crimes only came to light after one of his victims told a family member what had happened, years after the offence was committed. The rapist was confronted and later sent a message to one of his victims asking for forgiveness, the court was told. Cruickshank pleaded guilty last week to the indecent assault and one of the rape charges at a pre-trial hearing at the High Court in Aberdeen. The court heard the defendant was 15 when he carried out the rape. Cruickshank's pleas were revealed yesterday after he was found guilty by a jury at the High Court for two more rapes involving underage girls. The guilty pleas were accepted by the court last week but could not be reported until Cruickshank's . two-day trial finished on Friday. The pre-trial hearing heard how Cruickshank indecently assaulted the woman who was having a fit at some time between November 2005 and February 2009. Cruickshank knew the 18-year-old at the time of the offence. Advocate depute Bill McVicar said: 'During the seizure she was aware of what was going around her.' The hearing also heard how Cruickshank attacked a girl when he was 15. He pinned her to the ground in the kitchen of a property in Aberdeen and raped her, the court was told. The offence took place between September 1999 and March 2000. The defendant was convicted of the indecent assault and three rapes at the High Court in Aberdeen. He will be sentenced next month . Cruickshank pleaded not guilty to the other two rape charges. The jury of eight men and seven women took just over an hour to find him guilty of raping the two girls. The court heard Cruickshank raped one of the girls in Aberdeen when she was aged between seven and 11. He also raped another girl, also in Aberdeen, when she was aged between six and 10. Both offences took place between November 1999 and March 2003. Judge Lord Uist called for reports yesterday. Cruickshank is to be sentenced at the High Court in Edinburgh next month. He was put on the sex offenders register and remanded in custody.","David Cruickshank, 30, touched the 18-year-old while in her flat in Aberdeen .

"By . Steph Cockroft . Dull is a tiny Scottish village with barely 20 homes; Boring is a US town of 10,000, which proudly boasts two golf courses and its own brewery. But the two communities, which sit more than 4,500 miles apart, are today celebrating perhaps the only feature they have in common - their uninteresting names. After teaming up in 2012, the governor of Oregon declared Saturday, August 9 as a public holiday across the entire state - which would be known as Boring and Dull Day. The farming communities of Boring, Oregon and Dull, Scotland partnered up in June 2012 in an effort to boost tourism . Boring has around 8,000 residents and Dull has only about 80. Both are farming communities . Boring commemorated the first 'Boring and Dull' state holiday last year with an ice cream social in the local park, something they plan on doing again this year . This year, the Americans are celebrating the public holiday with free ice cream in the park and a piper, who is appropriately playing . Highland music. Nobody from Dull was able to travel from Scotland to represent the village, . but Boring will share the celebrations with its friend by . posting photos on their Facebook page. Steve Bates, chairman of the Boring Community Planning Organisation, told the Telegraph: 'Unfortunately nobody could coincide a visit to mark the day.' 'We are having free ice cream in the park. We will also have a bagpiper playing Highland music. He was trained in Oregon. 'We had also hoped to have the Sir . James McDonald Pipe Band from Portland, but they are over in Scotland . taking part in a competition.' The two places teamed up last year in a canny effort to boost tourism and combat the notion that their namesakes define them. The decision meant both places can sell novelty tourist items, get quirky road signs made and plan exchange visits. But the difference in size between Boring and Dull meant they could not officially become twin towns . Boring is located about 20 miles southeast of Portland. It has two golf courses and a few restaurants, as well as brewery. But the town has no movie theaters, grocery stores or hotels . Dull is located about 75 miles north of Glasgow and has only 20 homes . Boring is located about 20 miles . southeast of Portland.

Boring got its name from William Boring who moved to the area after the American civil war. The idea for a partnership came from a Dull resident who stumbled on Boring during a trip from Flagstaff, Arizona to Seattle. She took a photo of the Boring town sign and sent it to a friend back home in Dull, with a message jokingly suggesting that the towns should pair up.

"By . Steph Cockroft . Baroness Warsi has reiterated her anger at the Government's policy towards Israel, saying she quit so she could 'live with myself' - and not because she wants to write a warts-and-all memoir. The Tory peer, who was the first Muslim woman to sit on Cabinet, dramatically quit as Foreign Office minister on Tuesday, claiming David Cameron's position on the Gaza crisis was 'morally indefensible'. Mr Cameron was forced to break off from his holiday in Portugal to respond to criticism from the peer that he has failed to condemn Israel's bomb attacks. Scroll down for video . Baroness Warsi, who dramatically quit the Government earlier this week, . has hinted she had been unhappy with Cameron's stance towards the Gaza . crisis for some time- and said she did not quit so she could publish her memoirs . But sources suggested the real reason for . her resignation - which was met with fury by the Prime Minister's inner . circle - was her failure to land a plum job in last month’s reshuffle. Others suggested one of the reasons she resigned was because she is about to publish her memoirs from her time in Cabinet. Baroness Warsi was well-known as a fastidious note-taker during meetings and her account of life in the Coalition could prove explosive in the run-up to the general election. Nicknamed 'the stenographer', publishers hope she will be persuaded to publish them within months. She has reportedly already received approaches from firms wanting to obtain the rights to her story. But, speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today show this morning, Lady Warsi said: 'Am I about to publish a kiss and tell diary – no I am not. Look, again this detracts from the main issue right now.' When asked whether she quit after not being promoted above chairman of the Conservative Party, she added: 'If people want to make this about politics, that’s a matter for them. 'The reason why I resigned is the policy. I will not let this became a discussion about politics and tittle tattle and who said what, when. 'My departure clearly says long after politics has come and gone I want to be able to live with myself. And by resigning and stepping down I can live with myself.' During the interview, Lady Warsi hinted that she had been unhappy with the Government's stance for some time. The Tory peer - the first Muslim woman to serve in the Cabinet - today repeated her call for a suspension of arms exports to Israel, saying there is 'no clear commitment' from the UK Government on 'leading the international effort on accountability' In her resignation letter, Lady Warsi said the Government's 'approach and language during the current crisis in Gaza is morally indefensible, is not in Britain's national interest and will have a long term detrimental impact on our reputation internationally and domestically' The peer said she hoped her resignation would bring together a 'broad . coalition' to address issues behind the conflict - so Britain would 'lead the international effort on accountability on both sides'. She said: 'For me at that moment the . concern that I had was that even if the ceasefire had held, and I . sincerely hoped it had, there was still no clear language from the . Government in relation to the condemnation of what had happened. 'There was no clear commitment that we . would lead the international effort on accountability on both sides for . what had happened.' She . went on: 'Our language was not there. It was lagging behind. I don't . think it was just words that would have stopped me from doing what I . did. 'I think it was a combination of issues. It was the language that we were using, I think it was our lack of support for international justice and accountability for the crimes that had been committed.' David Cameron was forced to take a break from his holiday in Portugal, pictured, to respond to her resignation. In a response, he said: 'I very much regret that we were not able to speak about your decision beforehand' She also did not deny claims that she . would not stayed in post if William Hague was still Foreign Secretary, . rather than Philip Hammond. In her resignation letter, she . praised Hague, saying he was 'probably one of the finest Foreign . Secretaries this country has seen'. She responded: 'Look, I think these discussions I’m sure will carry on taking place at a later time.' Without speaking to the Prime Minister first, Lady Warsi posted the resignation statement on her Twitter feed. She said: 'With deep regret I have this morning written to the . Prime Minister & tendered my resignation. I can no longer support . Govt policy on Gaza.' Lady Warsi said today: 'I think it was our lack of support for international justice and accountability for the crimes that had been committed.' Pictured: A Palestinian salvages family belongings from the rubble following an air-strike . It . came as displaced Gazans began returning to their homes from UN shelters . after the latest ceasefire between Israel and Hamas took effect. The . 72-hour truce was agreed by both sides in the month-long conflict which . has seen hundreds killed. As part of her resignation, Lady Warsi called for an . immediate suspension of arms exports to Israel, which has been backed by . Labour and Liberal Democrats. Today, she said the Government needed to 'move towards a Middle East policy that is in the long term sustainable'. She . cited the UK's decision to abstain when the UN General Assembly voted . in November 2012 to recognise a Palestinian state as symptomatic of the . problems. She added: 'There . is no point in us talking about a two-state solution if we don't do the . simple things like recognising Palestine in the way that the majority of . the world has at the UN.' Lady Warsi dismissed complaints that she had failed to condemn thousands of rocket attacks on Israel by Hamas, or the actions of Islamic extremists in Iraq. She said: 'This dispute in Israel and this crisis is not a crisis between two religions. It has therefore got nothing to do with whether or not someone is a Christian or a Muslim or indeed Jewish. 'I have a very long and proud history of speaking out on the issue of anti-semitism, on speaking out against the persecution of Christians worldwide. I led the government effort on freedom of religion and belief. 'In relation to Hamas, as I said in my very first interview, Hamas is a terrorist organisation and I have no doubt they have not acted in the best interest of the Palestinian people. 'But I also made it clear that Israel as an occupying power has a responsibility not just to the Israelis but also to the people that it occupies. 'I have always believed in the right of Israel to exist - not just exist, but exist in a secure way. 'I do not believe that this is a way they needed to conduct themselves in order to achieve their aims.' Last night Labour upped pressure on the Government to suspend arms exports to Israel as rocket fire and air strikes resumed. Shadow foreign secretary Douglas Alexander called for the publication of a Whitehall review of existing licences. He also insisted that Lib Dem ministers should act to block exports, rather than merely posturing in public on the issue. Born in West Yorkshire, Lady Warsi became the first Muslim to sit in Cabinet when she was made Conservative Party co-chairman following the 2010 election. She was later moved to the post of ‘senior minister of state’ at the Foreign Office and minister for faith and communities in Mr Cameron’s 2012 reshuffle – a move widely regarded as a demotion. The peer was still allowed to attend Cabinet meetings. Despite the snub, however, she apparently harboured hopes of a promotion back to full Cabinet in last month’s reshuffle. But in fact, she has been out of favour for some time with the Conservative establishment. Nevertheless, there are concerns among some Tories that – with the election just nine months away – the Government’s Gaza stance could cost them the support of Muslim voters in key constituencies. In her resignation letter, Lady Warsi wrote: ‘My view has been that our policy in relation to the Middle East peace process generally, but more recently our approach and language during the current crisis in Gaza is morally indefensible, is not in Britain’s national interest and will have a long-term detrimental impact on our reputation.’ She added: ‘Early evidence from the Home Office and others shows the fall-out of the current conflict…and our response to it becoming a basis for radicalisation could have consequences for us for years to come.’ In the letter, she also referred to 'great unease across the Foreign . Office amongst both Ministers and senior officials' about the . Government’s policy on Gaza - but said today she would not 'name names'. In his reply, Mr Cameron expressed ‘regret’ that they had been unable to speak before she decided to go. ‘Of course, we believe that Israel has the right to defend itself,’ he wrote. ‘But we have consistently made clear our grave concerns about the heavy toll of civilian casualties and have called on Israel to exercise restraint, and to find ways to bring this fighting to an end.’","Tory peer, first Muslim woman in Cabinet, posted resignation on Twitter .

"By . Steph Cockroft . Four of the Royal Family's armed bodyguards are being investigated over claims that weapons seized from visitors to Buckingham Palace have gone missing. Three sergeants and one police constable from the SO14 Royalty Protection squad - the highly-trained police squad which shadows royals around the globe - are being probed over allegations of 'mishandling property'. One of the sergeants has been placed on restricted duty while officials from Scotland Yard's internal standards team investigate the claims. Four police officers from the highly-trained SO14 squad, which protects the Royal Family, are being investigated over allegations of 'mishandling property' from the weapons disposal bin at Buckingham Palace, where 'weapons' seized from visitors to the Palace are stored . One palace source said the claims - which centre around the 'weapons disposal bin' used during security checks at the Palace - had sent 'shockwaves' through the Palace. They told the Sunday Mirror: 'These officers are highly trained and highly trusted to protect Her Majesty and other senior royals. 'Any suggestion that they have been involved in wrong doing at the Palace will be very embarrassing for Scotland Yard. 'It beggars belief that apparently quite dangerous items have gone missing.' The probe involves allegedly missing items from the 'weapons disposal bin', where visitors to any royal residence, including VIPs and other royals, are made to go through security checks. Visitors must leave any property which could be considered as a weapon, including knives and scissors, in the bin. The SO14 unit looks after royals both in the UK and abroad, 24 hours per day. Three sergeants and one police constable are under investigation . Some of the more bizarre items which must be left behind include long umbrellas, alcohol and aerosols. The bin in relation to this investigation is reportedly located at Buckingham Palace, although a Met spokesman said he could not confirm this. SO14 is the unit of armed police officers which is responsible for personal protection for the Royal Family, both domestically and internationally. Around 50 officers from the 400-strong unit look after 20 members of the Royal Family, 24 hours a day, funded by the taxpayer. Officers, who are plain-clothed and licensed to carry firearms, usually carry a Heckler & Koch MP5 sub-machine gun and a Glock 17 nine-millimetre semi-automatic handgun. The unit is also responsible for looking after London's palaces, Windsor Castle and Balmoral, the Queen's Scottish estate. A Met Police spokesman told MailOnline: 'Officers from the Directorate or Professional Standards are investigating an allegation of mishandling of property from the weapons disposal bin by SO14 officers. Four officers, three sergeants and one PC, are the subject of the Directorate of Professional Standards investigations. One sergeant has been placed on restricted duties.' The spokesman added that none of the officers had been suspended and that no arrests had been made. The Met spends more than £300,000 every day protecting high-profile people from royals to senior politicians and visiting dignitaries.","Three sergeants and a constable probed for allegedly 'mishandling property'

Cherish Allen, 22, bought the pack of four Dairy Milk Caramel ice creams from her local Farm Foods store in Bell Green, Coventry as a treat for her children. Aurora, four, and her brother Tobias, two, started tucking into the ice creams as they walked home from a day out with Ms Allen and her partner Roy Smith, 31. Scroll down for video . Aurora Allen, four, pictured left, from Bell Green, Coventry, was tucking into a Cadbury's Caramel ice cream when she started choking on a metal spring which was hidden in the cone, pictured right . But Aurora suddenly started screaming in pain - after choking on the hidden metal spring. Ms Allen said: 'I used my instincts and checked her mouth. I spotted something shiny and fished it out of her mouth. It was a spring. 'I checked her hand and the ball bearing was in the very bottom of the ice cream. She choked slightly and started screaming so I think she tried to swallow it. 'Aurora was very upset. She wouldn’t eat her dinner because she kept saying the food would hurt her mouth.' Ms Allen said the consequences could have much worse, especially if she had instead given that ice cream to her younger son. She said: 'I was horrified, it is not what you expect from a little treat is it? I mean it could have been my two-year-old son. He might not have realised it shouldn’t have been there. Aurora's mother Cherish Allen, 22, said the ball baring of the spring was found at . the bottom of the cone and left her daughter screaming in pain . Ms Allen and her partner Roy Smith, 31, were walking along the street with their two children when the incident unfolded . 'The consequences could have been catastrophic. God knows what could have happened. I felt sick. Ms Allen, a full-time mother, said she also took Tobias' ice cream from him incase it was also dangerous. R & R Ice Cream, which produce the product, said the find was 'rather disturbing' She said: 'I took Tobias’s ice cream from him and he had such a tantrum because he didn’t understand. 'My partner Roy was mortified but he is glad Aurora is ok. I am livid that better measures are not taken to ensure this doesn’t happen. 'A stray bit of paper, a strand of hair you can understand, even if it is still disgusting, but not something potentially life threatening. 'You just don’t expect it, especially from such a massive well known company like Cadbury’s.' The couple have kept the spring in a tub until the matter has been investigated. A spokesperson from R & R Ice Cream, which produce Cadbury’s ice creams, said: 'Obviously if she has found a spring or a piece of metal than that really is rather disturbing as things like that should not get into the product. 'We do take a huge amount of care to ensure things like this do not get into the product and all products have to be passed through a metal detector.

"By . Steph Cockroft . British Open winner Rory McIlroy has revealed that breaking up with Caroline Wozniacki is the reason behind his recent unstoppable form. The 25-year-old world number one split from his ex-fiancée at the end of May this year, just days after the couple sent out their wedding invitations. Now the multi-millionaire - who is currently in pursuit of his second major title in four weeks - has revealed that what happened was 'for the best in terms of my golf.' Scroll down for video . Rory McIlroy, 25, pictured left, has told reporters that his break-up with ex-fiancée Caroline Wozniacki, 23, pictured right, is behind his recent success and was 'for the best' in terms of his golf . The Irish golfer, who is currently competing for his second major title . in a row after winning the British Open, said he is mentally in 'a far . better place' since his high-profile break-up with the Danish tennis . star . The golfer, who has a £12m annual contract with Nike, said: ‘I think what happened has been for . the best in terms of my golf. 'I’ve put a bit more time . into it and it has refocused me. I mean, what else do I have to do now? 'I go to the golf course, to the . gym and it’s just my life at the minute. I worked pretty hard before but . the past couple of months I’ve really just buried myself in my game. 'I've . practiced hard and I've done all the right things and I'm reaping the . rewards.' He added: 'Mentally, I am just in a far better place.' The Irish golfer, who won the coveted British Open last month, announced he and Wozniacki had split earlier this year because he was not ready for ‘all that marriage entails’. He said the decision to call off the . engagement - which came just hours before the start of a major tournament at Wentworth - was both 'mutual and amicable'. He later said in a statement released through Dublin-based communications consultants that the 'problem is mine'. The multi-millionaire announced the break-up just hours before the start . of the BMW PGA Championship at the Wentworth Club, Surrey, in May - . which he went on to win . McIlroy and Wozniacki were spotted at a cafe in Sloane Square, London just days before their split earlier this year . Last month,  Wozniacki posted this picture, saying she was . wearing heels for the first time in three years. Wozniacki was taller . than McIlroy in heels so often wore flat shoes . At the time, he said it would be difficult . to concentrate on the tournament on the back of a public break-up. He told reporters: ‘There is never a good time to end a relationship. 'I’m . not going to lie, it’s going to be really difficult but when I get . inside the ropes I’m going to have to try and concentrate on the matter . in hand. 'Obviously . (it's) quite a difficult time for Caroline and myself. It was mutual . and amicable and we both thought it was the best for us, the best for . both of us.' The 25-year-old has been on impressive form since the break-up, including winning the Bridgestone Invitational golf tournament earlier this month, left. Wozniacki, right, has had a less successful summer . But days later, McIlroy went on to win the BMW PGA . Championship at Wentworth. His form continued and, in July, he won the British Open by a clear margin. He has now claimed the halfway lead at the 96th US PGA Championship. Speaking to reporters at the halfway stage, he said: 'Golf is the number one priority to me . and while I'm on this run of form I want to try and keep it going as . long as possible. The couple were together for almost three years and were reportedly due to tie the knot in November at the Rockefeller Centre, New York . In a statement after the break-up, McIlroy, pictured with Wozniacki in 2012, said: 'The wedding invitations issued at the weekend made me realise that I wasn't ready for all that marriage entails' McIlroy, pictured with Wozniacki, said: 'I think what happened has . been the best in terms of my golf. I mean, what else do I have now?' 'I'm going to keep working hard and try and get even . better. Hopefully I can do that over the next few years and hopefully . you'll see golf like this more often from me. 'It . obviously works pretty well, so I am going to keep doing it.’ After two years together, McIlroy, who is worth an estimated £28million, proposed to Wozniacki in Sydney, Australia, on New Year's Day with a £120,000 diamond ring. The pair experienced an on/off relationship during their time together, with sources . close to the couple claiming McIlroy broke it off . with Wozniacki in April last year. The pair confirmed they were engaged on New Year's Day by posting a series of pictures on Twitter, featuring her diamond ring . But after the break-up was announced, the tennis player tweeted saying: 'It's a hard time for me right now'. She referred to supporting Liverpool - a subtle reference to her ex-fiancé's love for Manchester United . Ms Wozniacki was said to have tried on wedding dresses before the break-up . They . eventually confirmed their engagement on New Year’s Day after McIlroy, . who also won the US Open in 2011 and the U.S. PGA Championship in 2012, . proposed during a fireworks show on New Year's Eve in Sydney. According to sources, their wedding was due to take place at the Rockefeller Centre in New York on November 8. At the . time of their engagement, Wozniacki, who is worth an estimated £15m, . posted a picture of the engagement ring on her Twitter account. She wrote: . 'Happy new year everyone! Rory and I started 2014 with a bang! ...I . said YES!!!!' McIlroy then shared the same picture and added: 'Happy New Year everyone! I . have a feeling it's going to be a great year!! My first victory of 2014 . #shesaidyes!!' But in the statement after their break-up, McIlroy said: 'The problem is mine. 'The wedding invitations issued at the weekend made me realise that I wasn't ready for all that marriage entails. 'I wish Caroline all the happiness she deserves and thank her for the great times we've had.' Ms Wozniacki, who was born in Denmark to Polish parents, became world number one in 2012 but has yet to win a Grand Slam. McIlroy suffered a difficult golfing season last year and said he had considered seeing a sports psychologist to help overcome his issues. He is currently involved in a lengthy legal battle with his former management company in the courts in Dublin over commissions from his lucrative sports sponsorship and endorsement contracts. The golf star, who has a £12m a year contract with Nike, claims he has paid more than £4m based on unreasonable fee rates much higher than the norm in the sports agency industry.","Golfer split with tennis player in May, days after sending out wedding invites .

The 25-year-old victim, who was at the party with his wife and children, was also punched, kicked and put in a headlock by the vicious duo. Junior Mullings, 35, pictured left, and Marbri Briscoe, 35, pictured right, have been jailed for 27 months after stabbing a man 11 times in front of his children at Christmas Day party in Peckham, south east London . Briscoe and Mullings, both from Peckham, were jailed for 27 months after being found guilty at the Old Bailey of actual bodily harm. The jury returned verdicts of not guilty to attempted murder and not guilty to grievous bodily harm. Police said the row broke out over a piece of equipment the victim had borrowed days earlier from Briscoe. The equipment was a filter used in cannabis propagation - the method by which cannabis seeds are germinated. The two parties had exchanged text messages in the days leading up to the attack. But despite the victim returning the piece of equipment to Briscoe’s girlfriend, the threats had continued, police said. The court heard how the victim and his family went to the party at around 3pm on Christmas Day. When the family arrived at the party, the victim noticed Briscoe, Mullings and a third man - all of whom he had known for a number of years - acting aggressively towards him. They also started shouting abuse. The defendants were found not guilty at the Old Bailey of attempted murder and grievous bodily harm, but were convicted of actual bodily harm against the unnamed defendant . The victim went to leave, when he was grabbed by one and put in a headlock. From that position he was punched and kicked repeatedly and stabbed a total of 11 times. Ambulance and police were called to the scene and the victim was rushed to hospital. After a police investigation, the . suspects' photographs were circulated. Briscoe and Junior . Mullings were both arrested and charged with attempted murder on Boxing . Day. The pair stood trial alongside a third man, Steven Mullings, who was arrested on January 17 this year. All three were found not guilty of attempted murder and grievous bodily harm. Steven Mullings was also found not guilty of actual bodily harm. Met Police Detective Sergeant Iain Smith said: 'This was an incredibly vicious attack - it is difficult to comprehend how a dispute over a piece of equipment could have led to such a distressing outcome and a man with several stab wounds. 'I am satisfied with the result of our investigation and hope that this sentence will send a strong message to anyone thinking to use violence to solve a disagreement. 'We will do all we can to bring violent and dangerous individual before a court.'","Victim, 25, went to party with wife and children in Peckham, south London .

"By . Steph Cockroft . A pet shop owner and her boyfriend are living in their own homemade jungle - with meerkats, a six-legged tortoise and even a skunk called Lily. Alyss Dickinson, 23, and partner Andy Rogers, 41, also live with 22 snakes, five . tarantulas, two lizards, a barn owl called Barney and an exotic racoon dog called Freddie. The couple, who met through their mutual love for animals, even take their beloved skunk for walks on a lead around their neighbourhood in Lincoln. Animal-mad pet shop owner Alyss Dickinson, 23, from Lincoln, cuddles up every night in bed with her beloved skunk, Lily . Miss Dickinson, who lives with her boyfriend Andy Rogers and his two children, has a horde of pets, including 22 snakes, two lizards, three parrots - and this Barn Owl, called Barney . The couple's homemade zoo includes Jade, a green tree Python, pictured with Mr Rogers, and Sid, a Royal Python, pictured with Miss Dickinson . The animal-mad couple also custom-built a £3,000 summer-house extension for their meerkats, Alex and Serge, which they use as aplayground. But, at night, the meerkats are brought inside the family home to cuddle on the sofa - while Lily and Freddie sleep with the couple in their bed. Miss Dickinson said Lily cuddles up to her while she sleeps and is litter trained, just like any other pet. She said: 'We love snuggling up with the . girls in the evening and playing with Alex, Serge, Freddie and Lily. They are amazing pets and love being tickled and stroked just like any . other animal.' The couple and their children, including Izzie, pictured centre, take their skunk Lily and racoon dog Freddie for walks on leads around the neighbourhood . Their parrot Jackson is part of the family, which also includes five tarantulas and meerkats . The couple also converted their dining room into a specialised reptile house - which contains thousands of pounds worth of equipment. The pair, who met through the pet shop which Ms Dickinson owns, spend £150 each month on their pets' special diet of mice, rats and quails. The couple’s first skunk Phoebe, who died recently, also cost them £10,000 in healthcare. Miss Dickinson said: 'People gawp at us when they see us coming, it’s really funny. The family, which includes Hannah Rogers, 12, also have an Umbrella . White Cockatoo Parrot called Romeo, a Jack Russell dog called Mouse, a . parrot called Jimmy, a six-legged tortoise called Bob Bearded Dragon and . a panther chameleon called Rango . The couple, who met through their mutual love of animals, own a six-legged tortoise called Jimmy . 'We’re always getting stopped and people ask us what the animals are. Some people might say we’re mad but we don’t care, we love our unusual family.' Miss Dickinson took over the Lincoln Reptile and Pet Centre in 2010 when she was 19. A few months later, she persuaded her mother Wendy, 54, to buy the shop with her. Their skunk Lily and her animal siblings set the couple back £150 per month in food and they have also spent £3,000 building a specialist meerkat home extension . Her love affair with the weird and wonderful animals grew. She soon met Mr Rogers and they moved in together - complete with their horde of animals. She said: 'Thank goodness Andy knew me through work and already knew what I was like or he might have had a fit when I moved all the animals in!' The couple also have to make room for . Andy’s two daughters Hannah, 12, and Izzie, four, who are squeezed into a . bedroom in the three bed terraced house.","Alyss Dickinson, 23, and Andy Rogers, 41, take skunk Lily for walks on lead .

"By . Steph Cockroft . A policewoman stole a credit card from her mother's partner and used it to pay off the bill for a £6,000 holiday to Dubai. Natalie Scott, 36, from Barrow, Cumbria, had popped into her mother's house during a shift when she pocketed Christopher McKellor's card. Scott, who had worked for Cumbria Police for 12 years, quickly tried to use the card to pay for the trip for four, but the transaction did not go through. Natalie Scott, 36, pictured left outside court, and right in her police uniform, from Barrow, Cumbria, stole a credit card from her mother's partner while on duty so she could pay off a £6,000 holiday to Dubai . She later used the card at Manchester Airport and settled the bill for the 10-day holiday four-person holiday. The victim received a phone call from his bank, explaining there had been a transaction which took his card over the limit. Scott was arrested two days after she returned from her holiday. During the hearing at North Cumbria Magistrates' Court in Carlisle, Scott admitted theft and fraud by false representation. But she was spared an immediate prison sentence. The former police officer wept in court as the details of her crime, which took place on May 15, were heard. 'We expect the highest standards of professionalism, integrity and conduct from all police officers at all times' Cumbria Constabulary . Mr John Moran, prosecuting, told the court Scott was questionned after Mr McKellor . received the phone call from HSBC. He said: 'While on duty in full police uniform she has stolen her mother’s partner’s credit card. 'She said she saw the credit card by the door. She picked up the card and put it in her pocket and left the house. 'She said she was suffering from stress and depression due to her financial situation.' In mitigation, the court heard the crimes came 'out of desperation' and were a 'spur-of-the-moment stupid decision'. She had offered to reimburse Mr McKellor, magistrates were told. Scott was sentenced to eight weeks custody, suspended for a year. She was also ordered to do 200 hours of unpaid work, pay £5,996 in compensation and £85 in court costs. After the hearing, a spokeswoman for Cumbria Constabulary said: 'We expect the highest standards of professionalism, integrity and conduct from all police officers at all times and any allegations are investigated thoroughly. 'It is vital that our communities have trust and confidence in Cumbria Constabulary.'","Natalie Scott, 36, from Barrow, popped into mother's house during a shift .

"By . Steph Cockroft . A pub put up a Christmas tree more than four months early - but was forced to take it down when customers complained. Excited manager Mike Robinson got into the festive spirit by putting up a 12ft tree at the Harvester Bybrook Barn . restaurant in Ashford, Kent - despite there still being 140 days to go. But Mr Robinson, who erected the tree to coincide with a Christmas promotion, said he had now taken down the tree because the plan 'backfired'. Scroll down for video . This 12ft Christmas tree was put up in the Bybrook Barn Harvester restaurant in Ashford, Kent, 140 days before Christmas - but has now been taken down . The manager said it had all been a 'bit of banter' to promote the fact the restaurant had started taking bookings, but that several customers had made negative comments. He said: 'It was all a bit of banter, to tie in with the fact we are now taking bookings for Christmas parties, but the banter sort of backfired. 'People . did not necessarily complain but people made comments that it was a bit . too early to have a tree. So we took it down. We will just have to delay Christmas a little bit longer.' Mr Robinson said that, last year, they promoted their Christmas bookings using a model of Father Christmas. He admitted this year's efforts were a little 'overboard' and said he received an email from bosses at Harvester suggesting it was too early to have the tree. The Harvester chain said the decorations promoting their Yuletide menus should not normally appear until Autumn. The tree baffled diners, including Darren Payne, 47, and his fiance Belinda, 40, who went to the restaurant with 11 month-old daughter Eliza-Rose. Mr Payne a pharmaceuticals worker, said: . 'It was quite a shock to be greeted by a Christmas tree in August. I . understand that they are just getting in early for the Christmas . bookings.' The manager at the restaurant, pictured above, said it had been meant as a 'bit of banter' to tie in with their Christmas bookings promotion but that several customers had made comments . Diner Sam Richards, 35, also said: 'I went into Harvester and came face to face with a Christmas tree covered in fairy lights. 'I . don’t even want to be thinking about Christmas yet - it’s still 25C . outside and the height of summer - what are these muppets thinking . about?' Mum-of-two Tracy Sommerville said: 'As soon as I walked in with my two little ones my heart sank. 'All . I’m getting now is them rattling on about when Father Christmas is . coming and what presents they would like. I don’t need this in August.' A Harvester spokesman said: 'We do have our Christmas menus available now, as some of our guests like to book up early. 'However it looks like our manager has got into the Christmas spirit a little too soon - we normally don’t put our Christmas decorations up until the Autumn.'","The tree was put up in Bybrook Barn Harvester restaurant in Ashford, Kent .

"By . Steph Cockroft . Mother-of-one Sabrina Moss, 24, died in August last year in north London as she celebrated her birthday . A teenage drug dealer who is accused of shooting dead a nursery teacher at her 24th birthday party has been described by his own barrister as a ‘low-life toe rag'. Yassin James, 19, from Wembley, north west London, is accused of murdering mother-of-one Sabrina Moss in August last year on Kilburn High Road. Two other men - Martell Warren, 22, of Kensal Green, and Hassan Hussain, 29, of Willesden Green, north west London - are also on trial for murder. A fourth man, Simon Baptiste, 29, from Cricklewood, north west London, is accused of letting the alleged gunmen use his house as a base for the killing. Addressing Old Bailey jurors today, James’ lawyer James Scobie QC said the teenager was a drug dealer who 'makes a good living' out of misery. But he told the jury that this was a 'mile apart' from being a 'cold-blooded killer'. He said: 'Yassin James didn’t try to lie to you about what he is. He is a toe rag. 'He is a low life drug dealer - Class A - who hands out misery to a lot of people and he makes a good living out of it. ‘A toe rag Class A drug dealer is a mile apart from a cold-blooded killer who pulled the trigger at point blank range.’ The alleged murder took place after the group of men had gone to Woody’s Grill on Kilburn High Road to buy burgers. They were seen on CCTV chatting and laughing together hours before the shooting. The men then allegedly armed themselves with a MAC-10 submachine gun and a sawn-off shotgun. Meanwhile, Miss Moss, who lived in Neasden, . north west London, had been celebrating her birthday with friends at Love and . Liquor club in Kilburn. The young woman, who had a four-year-old son and worked at Alice's Wonderland nursery in Stonebridge, suffered a gunshot wound to the . chest. Sabrina Gachette, 24, and two other men, Mahad Ahmed and Edson Da Silva, were also seriously injured during the shooting. The shootings took place on Kilburn High Street, north . west London. Three of Miss Moss' friends were seriously injured and Miss Moss died from a gunshot wound to the chest . The court has previously heard how the . shootings were the tragic result of an 'deep-seated' ongoing dispute . between the alleged killers and a group from South Kilburn. The prosecutor had told jurors that the men carried out the attack to show they would not be 'trifled with'. Simon Baptiste, 29, from Cricklewood, north west London, is accused of . letting the alleged gunmen use is house as a base for the killing . Today, Mr Scobie accused his client's . co-defendant Warren of lying to the jury. He said he had a ‘love-in’ with the prosecutors as he tried to shift the blame. He told the court Warren, who allegedly . drove the gunmen to the scene, had fabricated a story to hide the fact . that two of his friends had been killed in a tit-for-tat gang feud. Mr Scobie said that Warren’s account of becoming a drug dealer after being involved in a motorbike accident was ‘pathetic’. ‘The truth is, and Warren knows it, that it’s called confess and avoid,’ he said. ‘Warren has jumped on the Crown’s bandwagon and there is a nice little alliance. His evidence is contrived. ‘Warren . lied about this nonsense with his mates dying in a car crash - why not . just say it how it is? They were executed.’ During the prosecution case, prosecutor Mark Heywood QC had told the court how the accused had allegedly stalked their victims before the shooting. He said: ‘The August bank holiday 2013 last year will live forever in the memory of some and that’s exactly by design. ‘On one side of the road during the last minutes of a night out was a young mother partying with friends. They were laughing, chatting and some were standing smoking on the pavements. Andrea Moss, Miss Moss' mother, is pictured here outside the Old Bailey. The trial continues . ‘On the other side of the road were men with hoods over their heads, likely in gloves, faces covered - two killers. ‘Behind . them a car facing the wrong way up a one-way street, in that was a man . who wanted it done just as much as they - ready to speed them away.' Warren, Hussain and James deny murder, three counts of attempted murder, two counts of possessing a firearm with intent to endanger life and two counts of conspiracy to cause grievous bodily harm. Baptiste also denies conspiring to cause grievous bodily harm. The trial continues.

"By . Steph Cockroft . A gay politician who made history when he was elected onto a council as a teenager claims he has been forced out of his job by homophobic bullying. Sam Phripp, 22, was the youngest politician to be elected to Mendip District Council three years ago and also won a seat last year on Somerset County Council. But the Liberal Democrat councillor claims he has now had to quit the county council because of 'hostility, intimidation and bullying'. Sam Phripp, 22, said he has stood down from Somerset County Council due to 'hostility, intimidation and bullying' He claims rival parties went door-to-door telling voters he was gay - and that one colleague even called him a dirty b***** homosexual' during a council meeting. Announcing his decision on his blog, So Sam Said, Mr Phripp wrote: 'I have to be clear however, that one of the main reasons I'm resigning is because it's becoming almost impossible to do my job properly against the obstruction coming from other politicians. 'I've always been happy to work across party boundaries to get things done. As far as I'm concerned, as soon as the elections are over, we all work together for the good of our areas. 'I've been met with such resistance, and - at times - such hostility, intimidation and bullying that I simply can't and won't go on any further.' The Liberal Democrat, from Frome, Somerset, first became a councillor aged 19 but said he has since had to deal with homophobic bullying, including being called a 'dirty b***** homosexual' He continued: 'During attendance at my first ever Council Meeting, my partner overheard me being referred to as 'that dirty b***** homosexual'. 'I've had time taken off sick characterised as time taken off on holiday. I've been chased down the road by a Conservative candidate shouting at me because I'd been speaking to local people outside of a shop. 'I've been harassed on Twitter to the point of having to block and report people - something I always vowed I'd never do. The 22-year-old, who studied at Bath Spa University, said it had found it 'impossible' to do his job properly due to obstruction from other politicians . Mr Phripp wrote about the reasons behind is resignation on a blog site, So Sam Said, which he has kept up during his time as councillor . 'I was told that I'd only won a seat on . the County Council because I lied (note, I didn't, and haven't . lied...), I was also told that during recent elections activists from . other parties had gone door to door telling people that I was gay - as . if it would be a reason not to vote for me.' He . added: 'If ever we ask ourselves why more 'normal' people don't want to . stand for election, please take that as a 101 from me.' A spokesman for Somerset County Council said it would not be releasing a statement or launching an investigation as no specific allegations had been made directly to the council. Mr Phripp, who studied English Literature at Bath Spa University, will remain on Mendip District Council until the next election.","Sam Phripp, 22, was youngest councillor to sit on Mendip District Council .

"By . Steph Cockroft . This is the moment a gormless burglar realises he has been caught red-handed on CCTV - seconds before he attempts to cover up his crime by stealing the camera. The open-mouthed thief stares directly into the lens for several seconds, seemingly unable to decide what to do with himself. He then appears to shout the word ‘camera’, before continuing to stare at the lens - still with his mouth wide open. Scroll down for video . Caught: This is the moment a burglar stares gormlessly into the lens of a camera after realising he has been caught on CCTV in Daventry, Northamptonshire . The open-mouthed thief looks directly at the camera for several seconds, seemingly unable to decide what to do with himself . Despite being caught on tape for the past 20 seconds, the burglar then . attempts to hide from the wall-mounted camera by ducking down out of . its view and shuffling underneath the lens. The defeated-looking burglar is then seen turning the camera to face the wall, before wrenching it from its stand and stuffing it in his bag. But unbeknown to the burglar, his efforts were pointless - because the video is still accessible in online storage. Phi Chong installed the high-tech camera in his parent's home in Daventry, Northamptonshire, in a bid to catch any intruders after they were burgled in November. The camera, which he had imported from the US, records straight onto the internet and goes into online storage. He has now shared the footage - including several still image from the video - on social media websites. The man seems to shout the word 'camera', suggesting there could have been an accomplice with him during the raid at the family home . The 30-year-old, a property developer . based in London, said: 'The look on the guy’s face is priceless as he . tries to figure out what to do next. 'Hilariously he then belatedly tries to hide from the camera by ducking underneath it. He obviously thought by stealing it would hide his crime but the footage was already sent to an online server. 'My parents were robbed in November and I suspected they would be back so I installed the camera. 'It’s the first camera of its kind and it’s not available in the UK, I had it imported from the US. There’s no evidence for the burglars to steal. It records straight to the internet and goes into storage. The defeated-looking burglar, who took cash and sentimental jewellery from the home, then starts to walk towards the lens . Hilariously, the thief then ducks beneath the camera, despite having . been recorded on film for the past 20 seconds. He then turns the camera . away from him . 'It is basically a web camera but the . sophisticated stuff is where it gets recorded to. You can hear him . talking and he is talking to someone else so there’s at least two of . them. 'He was mentioning a camera and before that he shouts something, it sounds like he is calling out a name.' The man raided the family home on Saturday afternoon between 1.30pm and 2.30pm. Mr Chong said nothing expensive was taken during the raid but he has appealed for help in tracing two items of sentimental value which he believes were taken. Before realising he was caught on CCTV, the brazen thief fiddled with the door in the living room . He said: 'My brother Vay Chong passed away and left a gold necklace and Buddha amulet. This was intended for his unborn son. He is having a child and it was meant to be gift for him.' His sister, Siu-Lan Chong, 32, added: 'We are upset and angry this has happened, given the recent death of my brother we are all going through an emotional time. 'The thoughtless and irresponsible act of these criminals has had an enormous impact on our family and we urge anyone who knows or has seen anything to come forward.' The burglary took place in Daventry, Northamptonshire, on Saturday between 1.30pm and 2.30pm . Northamptonshire Police have also released still photos from the footage in a bid to track down the thief, who they believe was carrying a weapon. Inspector Phil Mills said: 'We are investigating a number of leads, including CCTV footage provided by the home owner. 'We would like to speak to anyone who may recognise the man in the photograph or indeed anyone who may have seen any suspicious activity in the area around the time of the burglary. 'We believe he may have been carrying a weapon at the time of the burglary and would urge people to get in touch straight away if they recognise him..'

"By . Steph Cockroft . and Mark Duell . Southern Britain is set to be battered by flash flooding this Friday two days before the remnants of Hurricane Bertha make landfall across the Atlantic. A yellow ‘be aware’ rain warning is in place for the South East on Friday due to an unconnected weather front moving in from the English Channel. It comes after residents in the North East had to battle with heavy downpours and flooding today in the first glimpse of a wave of wet weather. Commuters in Newcastle were seen driving through deep flooding as up to 1in (25mm) of rain fell in just three hours, causing flash flooding in some parts. But the heavy rain is expected to clear to make way for sunshine later today and tomorrow. Scroll down for video . Commuters in Newcastle woke up to flooded roads this morning after heavy rain and thundery showers poured down across the north of England through the night . The flooding is the first glimpse of the wet weather which is expected to hit the UK this weekend, as the tail end of an Atlantic storm moves across to Europe . Emergency services had to attend to several minor road collisions and . were called to help residents who could not deal with this morning's . flooding . In just three hours, there was 11m of rainfall recorded in Durham and 11.4mm in parts of Cumbria, as heavy rainfall hit across northern and eastern areas . The tail-end of Bertha is then . expected to hit by Sunday, after it has been battering the Caribbean . islands with gusts of more than 90mph. As . it moves across the Atlantic tomorrow, it is expected to 'intensify . rapidly' but will slow down and 'weaken' again as it moves further east. Although . it has now been downgraded to an ‘extra tropical storm,’ Bertha is . predicted to bring two days of heavy rain for the South. Met . Office deputy chief meteorologist Chris Tubbs said: ‘There is a 70 per . cent chance it will hit the South and 30 per cent in the North. ‘I don't think winds will be an issue but because this was a tropical storm at origin, there could be very heavy rain. ‘The areas particularly vulnerable are along the south coast, across the London area and East Anglia. The three-day forecast shows a mix of rain, sunshine and scattered . showers across most parts of the UK, with heavy rain due, particularly . in the south, on Friday . Pedestrians shelter under their umbrellas from the rain on Newcastle Quayside. Many streets in the city were left with surface water flooding after rainfall last night . The Met Office said most of the country would see sunshine and dry . weather on Thursday, before rain starts to hit London, The Midlands and . the south and south east on England on Friday . The Met Office said there was not an 'unusual amount' of rain for this . time of year but that, because it fell in a short period of time, it led . to flash flooding in parts of the country, including here in Newcastle . There is expected to be more 'persistent' rain in . the north of the country on Friday, while a wet weather warning could be . put in place for southern parts of the country . Punts in Oxford, which are in demand by tourists . over the summer holidays, were left waterlogged this morning after a . night of heavy rain . ‘There . will be heavy rain of up to 50mm (2in) in that period.  If it falls in . between six and 12 hours there is a potential for floods.’ The . Met Office’s yellow warning on Friday was issued in Cambridgeshire, . East Sussex, Essex, Hertfordshire, Kent, London, Norfolk and Suffolk. It . alerted the public to ‘heavy, possibly thundery rain’ and a ‘risk of . disruption to travel due to standing surface water on some roads’. Bertha . is currently off the eastern seaboard of the US and is expected to move . across the Atlantic, with the remnants reaching Europe at the . weekend. But the Met Office . said its forecasts and those of other meteorological organisations show . the UK should miss any serious impacts’ from its tail end. The wet weather has already arrived in some parts of the country. Last . night in Carlisle, there was 0.97in (24.6mm) of rain recorded in six . hours, while parts of Cumbria saw more than 0.43in (11mm) fall in three . hours. Surfers in the water at Fistral Beach, Newquay, enjoyed the warm weather which spread across the south west today, after heavy rain in the area yesterday . After heavy rain on Tuesday, sunshine spread across the south west, including Cornwall. The sunshine . is expected to stay in the area until Friday, when rain is forecast . Forecasters said most areas would enjoy dry weather on Wednesday and . Thursday, with some sunshine and the odd heavy shower. Pictured: A dog basks in the . sunshine at Fistral Beach, Cornwall . This storm tracker shows Bertha moving across the Atlantic on Wednesday . and Thursday, before heading east towards the UK on Friday . This shows Bertha, shown in red, which has been downgraded from a . hurricane to a storm. The Met Office said it will lose momentum as it . leaves the warm seas and now has a 30 per cent chance of hitting the UK . This shows the direction of Bertha, which will cause a 'summer storm', consisting of blustery winds and rain, if it reaches the UK on Sunday evening . People flocked to Brighton beach yesterday afternoon to make the most of . the final rays of sunshine before a weekend of predicted wet weather . In Walkergate, . Newcastle, a number of commuters found themselves stuck in knee-high . rain water as they attempted to drive to work. Although . the Met Office said these measurements were 'not unheard of' at this . time of year, the sudden downpours did cause flash flooding. A spokesman said: 'The North East have experienced very heavy rain over the past 24 hours. ‘There were heavy showers in a short amount of time this morning which would have been what caused the flooding. 'The . rain is due to ease off and tomorrow will be a much brighter picture. It is going to be a dry night with clear spells and a fresh feeling.' Meanwhile, the heavy rain seen across eastern and northern parts of the country was expected to gradually clear today. In . other parts of the country, people will be able to enjoy mostly dry . weather today and tomorrow, with some sunshine and the odd heavy shower.","Commuters in Newcastle battled with heavy downpours and flooding today as thundery showers hit overnight .

"By . Steph Cockroft . The BBC's TV controller has today defended Jeremy Clarkson and insisted the Top Gear host is not 'racist'. Danny Cohen said he 'disagreed' with some of the language used by the presenter, but did not think anyone on the team was racist. Mr Cohen's comments came after it emerged he launched an internal investigation into the controversial show, which has been hit in recent months by a string of controversies. Scroll down for video . BBC TV controller Danny Cohen launched an internal investigation into the culture of Top Gear after Jeremy Clarkson used the word 'n*****' during an outtake - but Mr Cohen says the presenter is not 'racist' The investigation was instigated after footage was leaked showing Clarkson using the word 'n*****' in an outtake. Last week, the show was also separately criticised by . communications watchdog Ofcom for breaching broadcasting rules after the 54-year-old used a 'racial' term in the Burma special. But, in a letter to The Guardian, Mr Cohen . said: 'I want Top Gear to maintain its unique take on the world but more controversies of this nature would serve no one well. 'Whilst, Jeremy and I disagree on the language some have recently found very offensive I do not think he or anyone on the Top Gear team are racist.' He added that it . was 'no secret' there had been 'some significant issues' on the show, which he why he had 'instigated a health check... to ensure that there . were no further issues'. The inquiry was triggered after unaired footage emerged in May, showing the presenter reciting the rhyme 'eeny, meeny, miny, mo'. He then apparently muttered 'catch a n***** by his toe'. Although Clarkson initially denied the allegations, he later made a 'grovelling apology' for using the word. In a letter, Danny Cohen said: 'More controversies of this nature would serve no one well. Whilst, Jeremy and I disagree on the language some have recently found very offensive I do not think he or anyone on the Top Gear team are racist' Clarkson . was not fired over the furore, but he was given a final warning and TV controller Mr Cohen reportedly ordered a review . of the show’s culture and practices. The BBC has refused . to release the findings of the investigation since it was completed last month. Mr Cohen said it was 'no secret' that there had been issued over language used by Jeremy Clarkson, above, in the show . But it is understood that Mr Cohen 'wanted to launch . disciplinary action against Clarkson'. He met with production bosses to discuss the . issues raised in the report - but was allegedly blocked from further action by BBC . director-general Lord Hall. During the investigation, which took four to six weeks, it is understood that all Top Gear . staff were asked for their views on whether the hit show is racist. They . were also asked whether they felt afraid to speak out to their . superiors when they felt parts of the programme were offensive. Investigators also interviewed Clarkson and his co-presenters James May and . Richard Hammond as well as Top Gear’s executive producer Andy Wilman. The stars of the show were reportedly reminded of their . ‘responsibilities as BBC employees’. Earlier this month, in a separate incident, broadcasting regulator . Ofcom found Clarkson ‘deliberately’ used racist language during an episode . filmed in Burma, which was screened in March. The row broke out after the three . hosts were tasked . with building a bridge over the River Kwai in Thailand during the series . finale. After completion, Clarkson said: 'That is a proud . moment, but there's a slope on it', as a man walked towards him on a . makeshift bridge. 'Slope' is a derogatory term for those of Asian descent. The show also came under fire when Clarkson, 54, used the word 'slope' - a derogatory term for those of Asian descent - during an episode filmed in Burma. Ofcom ruled BBC had used an 'offensive racial term' Co-presenter Richard Hammond, 44, replied: 'You're right, it's definitely higher on that side.' In its report, Ofcom said the broadcaster was in breach of its code for using an 'offensive racial term' which was 'not justified by context'. It said: 'Jeremy Clarkson used the word 'slope' to refer both to an Asian man crossing a bridge, and the incline of the bridge. 'This . was scripted in advance. The BBC failed to take the opportunity, either . during filming or post-production, to check whether the word had the . potential to offend viewers.' The three hosts of the show - Richard Hammond, Jeremy Clarkson and James May - pictured during the Burma special. Mr Cohen admitted he 'disagreed' with some language used in the show . In its representations to Ofcom, . the BBC said programme makers were aware the word was 'used to refer to . people of Asian origin' but they considered 'such use was mere slang'. It . added they were not aware it had the potential to cause offence outside . the UK and would not have used it, had they been aware. Following . the Ofcom ruling, the BBC said: 'We dealt with this matter some time . ago, the programme apologised at the time and explained the context, and . we are now focusing on delivering another series of one of Britain's . best loved shows.' That was not the first - or last time - that Jeremy Clarkson has sparked controversy with some of his comments. Weeks . later, in unaired footage of the series, the 54-year-old presenter was . heard reciting the rhyme 'eeny, meeny, miny, mo' before apparently . muttering 'catch a n***** by his toe'. It . took place during filming of the third episode of Top Gear series 19 as . the star reviewed the £25,000 Toyota GT86 and the Subaru BRZ - which . costs around the same amount. Telling . viewers that they may find it difficult to differentiate between the . two vehicles he demonstrated how to do it using the child's counting . rhyme. After . initially denying the claims, Clarkson 'begged' for forgiveness, saying . he 'did everything in [his] power to not use that word', but that his . 'efforts weren't quite good enough.' Jeremy . Clarkson was also accused of racism for naming his black West Highland . terrier dog Didier Dogba after former Chelsea star Didier Drogba, who is . from the Ivory Coast. Clarkson became embroiled in a second race row, just weeks after the 'slope' controversy . Clarkson, . who often mocks political correctness, asked: 'Why is it racist to name . our amazingly brilliant dog after a footballer?' In 2012, the presenter compared . synchronised swimming to the deaths of 23 Chinese cockle pickers in . Morecambe Bay in 2004. He also provoked a flood of complaints when . he said his new TV’s energy-saving setting made it seem as if programmes . were being ‘presented by Lenny Henry in a cave’. In . December 2011, the controversial host came under under fire for . suggesting on BBC's The One Show that public sector strikers 'be shot in front of their families' - which prompted 31,000 complaints. Weeks . later, he provoked a fresh storm of protest after describing people who . kill themselves by jumping under trains as 'selfish'. In . his newspaper column in The Sun, Clarkson wrote that 'foxy woxy and the . birds' should be left to 'nibble' at the 'gooey parts' of people who . die by jumping in front of trains. An episode of the show filmed in India was also criticised by Indian . diplomats. The BBC also had to apologise to the Mexican ambassador after . remarks made by Clarkson and co-hosts James May and Richard Hammond.","Danny Cohen said he 'disagreed' with language used by Clarkson on show .

"By . Steph Cockroft . Liam Holohan, 22, from Chatham, Kent, bought emergency flashing lights and ambulance stickers so he could pretend to be a paramedic . A fantasist who dreamed about being a paramedic fitted emergency lights onto his car and put a 'First Response' sticker onto the bonnet so he could drive through 30mph zones at 70mph. Liam Holohan, 22, from Chatham, Kent, even bought a paramedic's uniform from the internet, as well as an 'ambulance officer' sticker for the back window of his makeshift ambulance. He was only caught when police spotted his Suzuki Vitara driving at 70mph through Maidstone town centre. Maidstone Crown Court heard the officer who spotted Holohan . recognised the Suzuki was . not a ‘normal response car’ for a paramedic. The court heard how Holohan - who also bought medical equipment for his vehicle - was . followed by police and ordered to the side of the road, but sped up and zoomed . off. He almost crashed on a series of corners as police chased him, the court was told. Holohan . drove ‘at speeds of up to 70mph’ in a 30mph zone for four miles before . ditching his car and running off, but was soon tracked down by police. When he was arrested, he told police he was a registered paramedic and was on his way home from work. He claimed he owned a firm that was . sub-contracted to the NHS to provide emergency response and that he had . been trained to drive in ‘emergency response conditions’. He lies collapsed, however, and he eventually admitted being a delivery driver.

He was also given a one-year community order and ordered to do 100 hours of unpaid work.

"By . Steph Cockroft . A close friend of Peaches Geldof has revealed how the young model craved to escape from her 'shallow' celebrity lifestyle so she could be a stay-at-home mother for her two young sons. Michele Kavanagh, part of the Gentle Parenting Group in Maidstone, Kent, of which Peaches was a member, said the 25-year-old found it difficult that none of her famous friends understood what is was like to be a mother. But, despite the close-knit nature of the group, Ms Kavanagh said none of the mothers had any idea about Peaches' heroin habit and were 'shocked' when she died. Scroll down for video . Peaches wanted to escape the 'shallow' celebrity circles in which she was involved to become a stay-at-home mother, just like her new friends in the mother and baby group . Taking about Peaches' celebrity world, Ms Kavanagh told the Sunday Mirror: 'She really wanted to be out of it. All she wanted was a normal life.' The 28-year-old added: 'She said she found the world of celebrity very shallow since she'd become a mother. 'She told me a lot of her famous friends didn't have children and didn't understand her if she spoke about how tiring it was to be a mum.' Peaches had joined the group, which promotes 'attachment parenting', in September last year. Attachment parenting is based on the belief that the first year of a child's life defines its emotional future and parents should therefore remain as physically close to their child as possible. After she joined the group, Peaches and Ms Kavanagh became close friends and would often meet at a local cafe, Pops', or go to Nando's for lunch. They also had play dates with their young children, Ms Kavanagh said. The mother-of-one said Peaches 'seemed happy', but confided in her new friends that she wanted to focus her attention entirely on her sons. But, as the main breadwinner, Peaches - who found parenting 'exhausting' - felt the pressure to keep working. Peaches was frustrated that her other celebrity friends did not know what it was like to be a mother, as she was to her sons Phaedra and Astala . Ms Kavanagh added that Peaches clearly missed her mother - particularly once she had children of her own - and did not have as close a relationship with her father Bob Geldof. In regards to Peaches' death in April, Ms Kavanagh said the group were completely shocked, especially as Peaches would not even drink coffee because it 'made her hyper'. After she died, her son Phaedra was left in the house alone for up to 17 hours. Ms Kavanagh said today that Peaches would have been 'heartbroken' if she had known her son would be alone for all that time. Earlier this week, a friend of Peaches Geldof's late mother Paula Yates claimed she desperately tried to confront the young model over her drug abuse, as friends around her 'turned blind eyes'. Ms Kavanagh said Peaches obviously missed her mother, Paula Yates, pictured right, particularly after her own children were born . Gerry Agar, the former publicist of Paula Yates, said she wrote a letter to Peaches six years ago in a bid to stop her suffering the same fate as her mother, . Ms Yates died of an accidental heroin overdose when Peaches was 11. But she said Peaches, a mother-of-two, suffered after those around her 'said nothing' - despite the 25-year-old relapsing. She told Grazia magazine: 'I knew she was in trouble with heroin years ago and I tried to confront her about it. 'So many people around her knew about it but said nothing. But I'd lost her mother and my best friend to heroin and I didn't want to lose Peaches.' Peaches, pictured with her husband Thomas Cohen, had playdates with her new friends and would often go for lunch with them . Peaches was found dead at her £1m home in Wrotham, Kent, in April, by her husband Thomas Cohen. Just a few hours before her death, she posted a picture of herself and her mother on the social networking site Instagram, adding the caption: ‘Me and my mum.’ Miss Yates died in 2000, aged 41. At an inquest into Peaches' death, the court heard stashes of heroin, burned spoons and almost 80 syringes were scattered around the family's country home. North West Kent Coroner Roger Hatch said the sometime television presenter, model and journalist had been trying to wean herself off drugs and was clean five months before her death. She had battled the addiction for three years and had been taking the heroin substitute methadone and having counselling. 'She said she found the world of celebrity very shallow since she'd become a mother' Michele Kavanagh . In November 2013, a drugs test showed her to be clean and Mr Cohen believed she had defeated the habit. But Mr Cohen, a 24-year-old musician, told the inquest she relapsed in February and was hiding heroin in the loft. Mr Hatch said Peaches' death was not quite history repeating itself, in regards to Miss Yates' death, because Miss Geldof had tried to break her addiction and had returned to the drug for reasons no one would ever know. She had 3mg per litre of diamorphine, the chemical name for heroin, in her blood. Her mother had 0.3mg when she died. Months before she died, Peaches appeared on This Morning opposite Katie Hopkins to debate the pros and cons of Attachment Parenting. The heated discussion, which took place in front of hosts Philip Schofield and Holly Willoughby, saw the pair comes to blows over the issue. Their public spat was later carried on over Twitter and in Ms Hopkins' newspaper column.","The young model found celebrity world 'shallow' after becoming a mother .

"By . Steph Cockroft . This is the dramatic moment that a helicopter carrying 16 oil workers had to be manually lowered by crew after it ran into difficulties while coming in for landing. Aberdeen International Airport was . placed on full emergency alert while the CHC-operated S92 aircraft was suspended in the air and airbags were set up on the ground for safe landing. The helicopter could be seen hovering just 8ft above crew as they worked to pull down the aircraft's landing gear, which had failed to deploy. This is the dramatic moment a ground crew had to manually lower the . landing gear of a helicopter - which was carrying 16 oil workers home from a North Sea platform - after it ran into problems at . Aberdeen airport . The warning light came on in the cockpit of the aircraft as it arrived back to the airport from a North Sea platform where the oil workers had been based. The incident took place on Tuesday, but photographs emerged days later showing the crew in action. One of the images was posted on an online forum for oil and gas workers and the photograph received a mixed response online. One local wireline operator, Mike Wetherly, of Aberdeen, said: 'Fair play to the lads that got under and sorted the landing gear! Good effort boys.' And oil worker Gavin Kimpton, of Sheffield, said: 'I was due out just after it landed and spoke with the guys coming off that chopper. It was hovering for an hour before they did this.' But others were less enthusiastic about . the dramatic end to the flight. Social media user Craig Stappard, from . Newcastle, said: 'This just gets worse.' Aberdeen International Airport, pictured, was thrown into full emergency alert when the incident unfolded . The runway remained open for other aircraft and an Aberdeen International Airport spokeswoman said flights were not affected by the incident. CHC said the aircraft would undergo 'rigorous checks' and maintenance procedures before going back into service. A . CHC spokeswoman said: 'An aircraft landed safely after an undercarriage . indicator came on during the approach to Aberdeen Airport. 'The . initial engineering inspection revealed that deployment of the landing . gear was delayed. It was successfully lowered manually and the aircraft . landed normally. 'The aircraft will be subject to rigorous engineering checks before returning to service.' The Scottish Fire and Rescue Service said they were called out to a full emergency at the airport at 10:26am. An SFRS spokesman said: 'We stood by and set up airbags to try to allow the helicopter to land. 'We had them set up in preparation. But it ended up landing safely.' The dramatic landing rescue comes after a string of fatal accidents which have heightened awareness of helicopter safety in the offshore oil industry. Last August, four oil workers were killed when their Super Puma L2 helicopter crashed off Shetland, a mile from the airport. It led to a review being launched specifically looking at helicopter airworthiness, training, . seat layout and 'operator decision making'. In 2009, 14 oil workers and two pilots were also killed when a Super Puma operated by Bond suffered a catastrophic gearbox failure. The rotor blades broke away from the aircraft as it was returning to Aberdeen from BP’s Miller platform.","CHC-operated S92 aircraft was returning workers from a North Sea platform .

"By . Steph Cockroft . Doctor Nazim Mahmood, 34, fell to his death from a penthouse in West Hampstead, London . A Harley Street doctor plunged naked to his death from his £700,000 penthouse flat. Nazim Mahmood, 34, was seen standing alone on his glass-enclosed balcony before falling in front of shocked passers-by in West Hampstead, London, on Wednesday. A passing doctor attempted to resuscitate the man but he was pronounced dead at the scene. After the fall, Dr Mahmood was left covered in just a blanket - in front of the mansion block and a busy Barclays Bank - for more than three hours. Police, who said the death was not being treated as suspicious, said there were no police tents available to 'shield the body' and apologised for any distressed caused. Dr Mahmood, a GP, ran Face Clinic London, a chain of medical clinics providing wrinkle treatments such as Botox and chemical peels. He is understood to have moved into the property in West Hampstead three months ago with his partner Matthew Ogston. Dr Mahmood was due to unveil another new clinic just yards from his home next week, as business apparently thrived. He already had two other clinics in Soho and Harley Street. He recently announced on the company’s website: 'We are proud to announce that Face Clinic London are now offering a third location in West Hampstead, North West London. 'From Tuesday 6th August Dr Nazim Mahmood will be running a clinic from 2pm to 8pm. We will be offering Botox wrinkle treatments, dermal fillers and excessive sweating treatments at this location.' Witnesses described how the naked man had been on the balcony - which is enclosed by a five foot high glass barrier - for only a few moments before he fell. Emergency services rushed to the scene but were unable to revive the victim. After the incident, residents were furious that the man was left on the pavement for so long, covered by just a thin red blanket. Mothers were apparently forced to shield their children as they walked past the scene. The body was finally removed by police later in the evening, who said there had 'no tent available' to protect the man's body. Floral tributes were left on the pavement outside the penthouse, which is located above a Barclays Bank . One shopworker said: 'The body was left outside for hours. I cannot believe they just left it there. It is like he is an animal.' A man, who gave his name as George, said: 'I know the guy and I used to see him walking past every morning. Dr Mahmood was one of the doctors behind Face Clinics, a chain offering treatments in three locations across London. The clinics, which employed five specialists, offer treatments including Botox, skin fillers, exfoliation, sweat treatments and semi-permanent makeup. Prices for Botox treatments begin at £200, with cheaper procedures from £75 and offers for going with friends. Earlier this week the chain posted a message online enticing customers to mimic the look of model Cara Delevigne by indulging in a semi-permanent eyebrow treatment. Customers writing on the site named Dr Mahmood as part of the 'friendly and inviting' clinic who 'put me at ease' before a Botox treatment. 'He was Asian in appearance, always used to wear a suit and tie. I think he might have been rich.' George went on: 'There were lots of kids walking past. Their parents were making them cross the road so they did not see the poor guy.' A security guard from a Sainsbury’s opposite said: 'A woman and her child walked out and witnessed the man falling. He landed on the pavement and people rushed to help him. Everyone was in shock.' He added: 'There was a friend of his, a white guy who looked like he was on something. He looked like he had gone mad. I think the police might have taken him away to calm him down. He was shouting ‘no, no’ and did not seem focused.' A neighbour, who was present when police informed Mr Ogston of his partner’s death, said: 'He was devastated. 'It is just terrible that this has happened. He seemed like a really nice guy. He was a GP. We did not know them well as they only moved in April.' Dr Mahmood graduated from the University of Birmingham medical school in 2003 and moved to London a year later. He worked in a number of teaching hospitals in different specialities including, accident and emergency, HIV medicine, obstetrics and gynaecology and paediatrics, before completing his specialist training as a GP. In 2009 he founded Face Clinic London with a colleague, Dr Anita Kapoor. She declined to comment on his death, saying: 'In order to be respectful I would like to be left alone at this time.' A Scotland Yard spokesman said: 'The death is being treated as non suspicious at this early stage. Detectives from Camden are investigating.' He added: 'There was no tent available to officers to shield the body from the public. Officers instead used blankets. We apologise for any distress this may have caused members of the public.' A London Ambulance Service spokeswoman added: 'We sent two ambulance crews, a responder in a car, an officer and London Air Ambulance to the scene. Sadly the patient was pronounced dead at the scene by the doctor from the air ambulance.' An inquest will be held at a later date.","Nazim Mohmood, 34, provided wrinkle treatments such as Botox to clients .

"By . Steph Cockroft . Natasha Gascoine, 25, said she is giving her rugby player husband Andy Powell one last chance to make their marriage work . The wife of 'scrumbag' rugby star Andy Powell has revealed she is giving the Welsh player one last chance to make their marriage work. Natasha Gascoine, who is 16 weeks pregnant with Powell's child, branded the former British Lions player a 'liar, cheat and a scumbag' when their marriage failed in March this year after just nine months. During the very public spat, the 25-year-old posted screengrabs of his sexually explicit texts to her on Twitter and also put her husband's rugby gear for sale on eBay. But, in May this year, Ms Gascoine confirmed she was pregnant again - and that 32-year-old Powell was the father. Now she says the couple - who have had an openly tempestuous relationship since they married in May last year - have one last chance to 'make it work'. She told the Daily Mirror: 'At one point, I blamed him for losing my babies. But he is so happy about the baby and he can't wait to be a dad. I know we can make it work this time.' She also described how her husband had changed since their break-up and something has 'clicked in his mind'. She added: 'Andy told me wanted to make a go things and get his life back on track. 'He has been very apologetic. I don't know whether it is because I am pregnant or because something clicked in his mind.' The pair's reunion came after they started divorce proceedings in March over Powell's alleged infidelity, . drinking and gambling. At the time, Ms . Gascoine was 17 weeks pregnant. She miscarried one month later. After that, the pair argued very publicly via Twitter - and the row even went on to include 6ft 4in Powell bizarrely posting a naked picture of himself. Ms Gascoine also sprayed the words 'scumbag' and cheat over his house and pink . Mercedes, and even went onto eBay to sell her £10,000 engagement ring, . wedding ring, jewellery, dress and the gifts the pair received on the . big day. She wrote on the . auction website: 'The sentimental value has gone and to be honest. Since . being married to him I have realised how fake he really is. And what a . great let down he has been.' Office . worker Ms Gascoine gave the proceeds of her clear out to Women's Aid . and Samaritans - charities she describes as 'close to her heart'. But today she revealed how she saw Powell's 'dark side' for the first time on the New Year's Eve - five months before they were married. The pair had become engaged after a whirlwind three-month relationship - but Ms Gascoine said things quickly went downhill. She told how 'he just flipped' when . they returned home from New Year celebrations and punched his fist into . the wall when there was no food in the house. Scroll down for video . Ms Gascoine branded her husband Andy Powell, pictured here playing for Wales, a 'scumbag' in March amid allegations he had cheated on her. But she says the rugby player has now turned his life around . Scorned Ms Gascoine posted this one-fingered gesture at her husband during the public spat, pictured left, which came just nine months after their luxurious wedding in May last year, pictured right . Despite her concerns, the pair went on to marry at the Celtic Manor golf resort in Newport in May, . which was followed by a £30,000 party at a hotel in Majorca. But that wedding was the start of several more ups and downs for the couple. Before flying out for the big day, Ms . Gascoine said Powell admitted he did not have any money and could not . pay the final £11,000 bill. He then only managed to pay it - by recouping the money on a bet, she said. Then, the night before the . party, Powell allegedly turned up to the hotel drunk and was almost . restrained by Spanish police officers. During the public spat, she posted Powell's clothes - including his wedding suit - on eBay, before donating the proceeds to charity . She also marketed the rugby player's boots on the site for just £16 . Ms Gascoine told how, once married life began, it emerged Powell had a gambling problem. It . was only revealed when Ms Gascoine found his betting slips all over the . flat. She told how, in the first week of August, he had spent £7,300 - . three times his wage. The day after Ms Gascoine was quizzed by police over the alleged car vandalism, Powell posted this bizarre picture to Twitter . After breaking up and again reconciling, the allegations of Powell's cheating emerged. She . said at the time: 'I don't think Andy Powell knows who he really is, . he's built a character to fool everyone who knows him and I fell for it. 'I . wouldn't want anyone else going through what I have been through, I've . been holding up my wedding dress, thinking of the future we had planned - . destroyed.' But, after . returning from a holiday to Dubai with a friend in May this year, Ms . Gascoine announced she was pregnant for the fourth time in just over a . year. At the time, she tweeted: 'Coming back . from Dubai & I have found out I'm pregnant for the fourth time in . almost a year,"" she wrote on Twitter, posting a photograph of her . positive pregnancy test. 'Soo . nervous :( really wish I could be excited and calm about it. Trying not . to build up my hopes but also to avoid thinking the worse possible . scenario :( . 'Fingers crossed . and God's luck everything turns out ok. I got to 17 weeks last time... 6 . weeks second and very early few weeks first time. Extremely nervous :( . xxxxx.' Speaking about their reunion, she aaid: 'Andy was ringing me and . texting me and I ignored it but a a few weeks after we thought: ""We'll . put everything behind us and move forward"". 'He said he didn't want us to get divorced - and we still love each other, there is no doubt about that. 'It took me a while to accept because I was still really angry. 'He . said he would do various things to make it up to me and we'd get back . on track and see each other here and there and now I'm pregnant again.' The pair are now living together at her parents' home in Usk, Monmouthshire while Powell has signed for the Newport Gwent Dragons. The couple have had a tempestuous relationship but Ms Gascoine said they are now moving forward and looking forward to becoming a family . Powell played for the Cardiff Blues, Wasps and Sale Sharks during his rugby career, before crossing codes to play rugby league for the Wigan Warriors. But his move ended after just five games for Wigan when he picked up a neck injury, and he was released by the club in January. He won 23 caps for Wales, and toured South Africa with the British and Irish Lions in 2009. But he was also known for his off-field problems. In 2011 was suspended after getting embroiled in a bar brawl with football fans. In 2010 he was banned from driving for 15 months and fined £1,000 for driving the stolen cart along the hard shoulder of the M4 to 'get some munchies' from a service station at 5.30 in the morning.

"By . Steph Cockroft . A pet owner was forced to watch as a neighbour's dog burst through her front door and savaged her tiny pet to death. Julie Davies, 55, was in the kitchen cooking dinner at her flat in Highworth, Wiltshire, when the vicious Rottweiler-Bullmastiff cross burst into the family home through the open door. It lunged at Ms Davies' Yorkshire Terrier Maltese cross Pepe - which was cowering under the kitchen table - and killed it instantly. Yorkshire Terrier Maltese cross Pepe, pictured above, was mauled to death in its own flat by a neighbour's dog in Highworth, Wiltshire . Ms Davies and her partner Swithin Cardoso, 40, managed to grapple the dog out of the ground floor flat, but it remained in the car park at the block of flats until police arrived. But Ms Davies warned it could have been far . more serious as her nine-month-old granddaughter arrived at the flat just 10 minutes . after the attack. She said: 'It was terrifying. It was just fear. You knew straight away. I froze in fear because you could just see his whole behaviour and his head was going from side to side. 'My little dog ran from the living room just because he heard the door bang. He was under the kitchen table and this dog just lunged. 'He threw himself at my dog. I knew within seconds our dog was dead. It was absolutely horrendous.' The incident happened around 8pm on Tuesday as Ms Davies cooked dinner. Marie Burns, 33, the daughter of Julie Davies, is pictured here with Ms Davies' dog Missy - who was not hurt in the attack - and her children Mia, left, Francesca, second from right and Tom Davies, . right. Ms Burns said Mia arrived at the flat just ten minutes later and . could have been the victim . Ms Davies had left the kitchen door open to allow a breeze through her flat on . one of the hottest days of the year. The dog then ran up . the external stairs and pounced at Pepe, a family pet for more than six years. Her partner Swithin, who is 6ft 5ins tall, wrestled with the dog, before forcing it back outside. The Rottweiler-Bullmastiff cross belonged to a neighbour and has now . been put down by the owner. No charges have been brought by police (file . pic) The dog has now been put down by the owners, police say. Ms Davies said: 'It infuriates me because if it had been 10 minutes later my granddaughter would have been here, crawling around. It doesn’t even bear thinking about.' Marie Burns, 33, Ms Davies' daughter and mother to her granddaughter Mia, said: 'The owner of the dog arrived 15 minutes later, before the police. 'He didn’t seem to care or show any remorse. He just said it was his girlfriend’s dog and it had nothing to do with him. 'When we told him our dog had been killed, all he could say was ""It’s only a dog"". He just kept saying it’s not his problem.' Police were unable to take any action, but a spokesman for Wiltshire Police said: 'Police officers have no power to seize dogs unless they witness an attack themselves or if the animal is a banned breed. 'The owners of the dog involved have taken the decision to put the animal down. 'The investigation is continuing to ascertain the circumstances around the incident and any witnesses should contact 101 or Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111, where information can be left anonymously.'","Julie Davies, 55, from Highworth, Wilts, had opened front door while cooking .

"By . Steph Cockroft . Martin Whapshare, 73, has had this necklace chain - . on which he had his late wife's wedding ring - allegedly stolen while in hospital . A pensioner allegedly had his late wife's wedding ring stolen from around a chain which he was wearing around his neck while being treated in hospital. Martin Whapshare, 73, spent more than 40 days in Darent Valley Hospital in Dartford, Kent, where he was treated for a life-threatening infection. After his wife Mavis passed away aged 78 in June last year, the former warehouseman had her gold wedding ring fitted on his necklace next to a gold St Christopher pendant, so it was always 'close to his heart'. But on July 19, one month after he was admitted to hospital, Mr Whapshare's daughter Dawn Granger realised his the jewellery had gone missing from around his neck. Police have now launched an investigation into the missing jewellery. The incident took place just weeks after the couple, who had three children, would have celebrated their golden wedding anniversary. Mrs Granger, 43, said: 'I knew he had it on in hospital, because I took a picture of him and you can clearly see it around his neck. 'Somebody must have taken it while he was asleep, because it was a strong chain. He loved that ring, just like he loved my mum. It’s despicable what’s happened.' The grandfather-of-six, who has now been moved into temporary sheltered accommodation, has a picture of her on his dinner tray so he does not have to eat alone. Mrs Granger said she felt sick when she realised the necklace was gone. She said: 'When I noticed it was gone, I asked ‘Dad, where’s your necklace?’ He didn’t know, he’s really not very well. Mr Whapshare and his wife Mavis tied the knot in 1964, pictured above, and were married for almost 50 years when she died in June last year . Since his wife's death, the pensioner has worn her gold wedding ring on a . chain which he wears around his neck, alongside a St Christopher . pendant, so it is 'close to his heart' 'He is devastated because it was my mother’s wedding ring and they got married at the end of June in 1964. 'He always says to people that he wears it close to his heart because that is where she is. It’s quite a hard time for him and this on top is just heart-wrenching. 'I’m more heartbroken than he is really because I’m more aware.' His daughter Dawn Granger noticed the keepsake was missing when she went to visit her father in Darent Valley Hospital in Dartford, Kent, where he had been treated for one month . The hospital say they have conducted a thorough search of the ward and found a silver chain with a pendant on it, but this is not the jewellery that belongs to Mr Whapshare. Mrs Granger added: 'The whole situation makes me sick. It was worth around £500, but to me and my family it was priceless. 'I wouldn’t sell my mum’s ring for a million pounds.' A spokesman for the hospital, pictured, said staff searched the ward to try and find the necklace and would continue searching for the missing items . A Darent Valley spokesman said: 'A family member has reported that her parent’s necklace with a pendant and wedding ring went missing during their stay in hospital. 'After a search of the ward we found objects that appeared to match closely the initial description of the missing items but the family member has since advised us these are not her parent’s. 'We are continuing to look for the missing items but would remind patients not to bring valuables into hospital, and to arrange for a friend or relative to keep them safe at home during their stay.' A police statement said: 'Kent Police is investigating an alleged theft from the person of another in Dartford.'","Martin Whapshare, 73, always wore Mavis's ring so it was 'close to his heart'

"By . Steph Cockroft . Paul Jenkins, 35, from Caerau, south Wales, was jailed for 15 months after crashing into a mother-of-three while she called a taxi from the pavement . A mother was left fighting for her life after being hit by a schizophrenic motorist who claimed voices in his head told him to drink-drive. Paul Jenkins, 35, was driving while over the legal drink-drive limit in Maesteg, south Wales, when he swerved into 47-year-old Karen Tatchell, while she was standing on the pavement calling a taxi. Despite throwing Mrs Tatchell into the air, Jenkins failed to stop. He left the victim lying helpless on the ground outside the Llynfi Coach House, while her husband Huw was still inside. Jenkins, who had denied driving . dangerously, said he thought he might have been fiddling with . the car stereo when his car mounted the pavement. During the trial, he told the court: 'I didn’t see them - I’m devastated. I didn’t know I had hit anyone.' But Cardiff Crown Court heard Jenkins, who lives with his parents in Caerau, later claimed in a psychiatric report that voices had . told him to drive home after drinking. Defence . barrister Tim Evans said Jenkins - who had a previous conviction for drink-driving - was diagnosed with schizophrenia some years . ago and his mental health had deteriorated recently. Recorder Jeremy Jenkins said it was 'worrying' that 'voices' were apparently instrumental in what happened. Jenkins was jailed for 15 months after . being convicted of driving dangerously, being over the limit and failing . to stop after the accident. The court heard that, after the crash, he was found by police in his flat a couple of streets away, watching TV in his bedroom. They tracked him down after finding a broken wing mirror and matching it to the dark-coloured car in which Jenkins was driving. Meanwhile, the mother-of-three was left in a coma and still suffers problems with her memory. Home carer Gillian Fencott of Nantyffyllon told the court: 'My husband John was on my left and Karen in front of me and it happened so quick. 'I saw a car and next minute it mounted the kerb and they were both on the floor. I’d heard a ‘bang.... bang’ as they were hit. The car went on, swerving.' Karen Tatchell, 47, was left lying helpless on the ground after Jenkins failed to stop at the scene. She spent 'considerable time' in a coma and still suffers from memory problems . Witness Nicola Thomas said Mrs Tatchell had been calling for a taxi at the time. She said: 'I suddenly saw John going up in the air and landing right in front of me. I didn’t see it hit her but she was on the floor and John was trying to get up to help her.' Mrs Thomas’ daughter Jessica added: 'I saw a dark car coming down then up on to the pavement. It hit her, she went up and came down on her side.' The recorder told him: 'You made a conscious decision to drive home that night knowing you had been drinking and suspecting you might be over the limit. Recorder Jeremy Jenkins at Cardiff Crown Court, pictured above, said it was 'worrying' that 'voices' were apparently instrumental in what happned . 'You told the jury you were driving slowly because of it and have (since) said voices told you to drive. 'While I accept you have a long-standing mental illness, the consequence of your decision was that you mounted the kerb outside the Llynfi Coach House and careered into a number of pedestrians who were chatting after an evening out and waiting for their taxis. 'Karen Tatchell was thrown in the air and was in a coma for a considerable time and still has long-lasting difficulties. The crash took place outside the Llynfi Coach House in Maesteg, pictured above, while Mrs Tatchell's husband Huw was still inside . 'This is a serious case of its kind and had the offence been committed just a few months later (following new legislation), you would be facing a much longer sentence.' The maximum term, at that time, of two years, was reduced to 'reflect Jenkins’ illness' and a copy of his psychiatric report was ordered to go to prison with him. Jenkins was described as vulnerable and someone who would . find prison difficult. He was banned from driving for five years.","Paul Jenkins, 35, crashed into Karen Tatchell, 47, in Maesteg, south Wales .

"By . Steph Cockroft . Britons are said to be flocking to the US for their summer holidays to capitalise on the soaring rate of the pound against the dollar. The value of sterling has risen to 1.68 dollars for every pound - the best rate which British visitors to the US have seen since 2008. The expected rise in bookings to the US comes as it was revealed that St Ives - one of the most popular seaside resorts in the UK - is the most expensive coastal resort to visit on holiday in August, with the average cost of one room per night priced at £123. Britons are expected to flock to the US to . make the most of the soaring rate of the pound against the dollar. Pictured here is Disney World in Orlando, Florida, which is expected to see the biggest influx of British tourists . With the current exchange rate, £500 will buy around $845, which is around $85 more than last year and $130 more than 2009. Foreign exchange firms have now said they expect a surge in bookings to the US, with Florida expected to be the most popular destination. This is said to be helped by the low prices at Disney World, the famous family resort in Orlando, compared with other European destinations. A spokesman for World First, based in London, told MailOnline: 'Looking at how the exchange rates have moved in the last year, it’s clear to see that your pounds will now go further. 'At today’s GBPUSD exchange rate of 1.6896, £500 gets you $845. Six months ago, the same amount would have got you $815, and a year ago it would have been even less - $760. 'That’s a big difference in the space of a year, and with the exchange rates in Brits’ favour, more and more of us may be tempted to take advantage of a strong pound.' Alistair Rennie, a spokesman for First Rate Exchange Services, also told The Daily Express that the strong exchange rate spelled good news for those wanting to head across the Atlantic, especially to Florida or New York. He said: 'Sterling's recent surge in value could prove . the catalyst that galvanises more people to plan trips abroad. Pricey: . St Ives in Cornwall has been named the most expensive seaside town in . the UK for this August, as Britons flock to the resort to make the most . of the balmy weather . 'In . the coming weeks family trips to ­Florida are likely to be most popular . and holidays to see New England in autumn are also likely to see a . benefit. 'As the year progresses, shopping trips to New York are likely to get a boost as the pound will make shops in the Big Apple even cheaper than before.' In its latest research, Post Office Travel Money found prices in the popular US resort are much lower than those in other common destinations such as Spain and France. Throughout 2013, prices for tourist items such as meals and drinks had plunged over 20 per cent year-on-year in the world’s theme park capital, the research found. A three-course family meal for four . people is now said to be priced at around £48, while clothes and beauty . products are said to cost up 50 per cent less than in London. 'Sterling's recent surge in value could prove . the catalyst that galvanises more people to plan trips abroad' Alistair Rennie, First Rate Exchange Services . Hiring a car was also cheaper in Florida than in 19 European destinations, according to predicted prices in August. The strong exchange rate will come as . a blow to some UK resorts, in the competitive market to  recruit . holidaymakers for a 'staycation'. As . Britons consider making the most of the recent sunny weather and . spending their holidays nearer to home, the top 20 most expensive . seaside retreats have been revealed. In the survey, compiled by cheaprooms.co.uk, a break in St . Ives was nearly double the cost of a . stay in Aberystwyth, Wales. In second place was Tenby . in Wales, where an average room is £107, and Cowes on the Isle of Wight, where rooms are £94 on average. The list was compiled using the cheapest price of a double room . in accommodation near a beach rating three stars or higher in August. Dartmouth in Devon, which is £87 per night, and Barmouth in Wales - £86 - were fourth and fifth in the last. Falmouth . and Padstow, two more resorts in Cornwall were named in the top 10. They share the sixth spot with Scotland's Oban at an average rate of £84 . a night. Swansea - £83 - and Swanage in Dorset, with an average price of £81, make up the final top 10. 1.

"By . Wills Robinson for MailOnline . A former Big Brother contestant and glamour model burst into tears today after she was banned from driving and fined £250 for being drunk at the wheel. Aisleyne Horgan-Wallace was on her way home from a West End fundraiser for 'Save Your Skin' cancer when she was stopped in her black Range Rover  on Edgware Road, west London, in June. The 35-year-old, who shot to fame in 2006 after coming third in the reality TV series, was almost twice the legal limit and was subsequently arrested. Guilty: Aisleyne Horgan-Wallace, 35, pictured left leaving Hammersmith Magistrates' Court, admitted drink-driving after she was stopped on the way home from a West End party (picture is not her driving at the time) The model claimed she was forced to take the wheel after paparazzi mobbed after the pool party at the Haymarket Hotel, which was hosted by fake tan company Fake Bake. Prosecutor Rav Chodha told Hammersmith Magistrates' Court she was in a collision with a Mercedes and left without exchanging her details. He added: 'Members of the public who were present had attempted to try to speak to the driver of that vehicle. ‘The vehicle was picked up by automatic number plate recognition cameras on the Edgware Road.' When she was interviewed, Horgan-Wallace confessed she had consumed a large glass of white wine at the party. She denied failing to stop at the scene of an accident and the Crown Prosecution Service dropped the charge. Defence lawyer Maya Lal told the court Horgan-Wallace is a ‘business woman with a portfolio of properties in north London’ and is soon to embark on a career as a comedy actress. She said the glamour model found herself surrounded by paparrazi when she left the hotel and was forced to take the wheel of the car after her friend kept stalling. ‘The defendant was driving from her home address with her friends, she was on her way to a charity event for Fake Bake,’ she said. Reality television: The glamour model, who was disqualified from driving for 17 months, shot to fame in 2006 when she became a contestant on the seventh series of Big Brother . ‘She had driven to this event and she had no intention of drinking as this was a business event. ‘Towards the end of the evening she had one large glass of white wine and she hadn’t eaten since the morning.’ She added: ‘The journey had been made difficult by all the press and paparazzi surrounding the vehicle and Danielle [Horgan-Wallace’s friend] stalled the vehicle.’ Magistrates heard Horgan-Wallace’s friend suffers from Crohn’s disease and had started to panic and stall the car. ‘She couldn’t get the car out from where it had been parked and that is when the defendant decided to drive as she believed she wasn’t over the limit,’ said Ms Lal. She added Horgan-Wallace ‘stopped immediately’ when asked by the police. Ms Lal added: ‘She would just like to say to the court that she is profusely apologises for her behaviour.' Horgan-Wallace admitted drink driving, was fined £275, with £85 costs, ordered to pay a £27 victim surcharge and was disqualified for 17 months. She was initially fined £1,500, but magistrates reevaluated her earnings and the amount was reduced. The court heard that she earns £10,000 a year, which is supplemented by £700 a time interviews, which pay her another £4,-5,000 a year. She told magistrates as they tried to asses the fine: 'Tomorrow I have an interview and I'll get seven hundred pounds for that. It comes to probably an extra four or five grand a year.' Raised as a Jehovah's Witness in north London, Horgan-Wallace is also the patron of several charities and the court was told she is the 'face of' National No Smoking Day. Dressed in a tight black dress, black patent heels and a navy fitted blazer, the model burst into tears as Magistrate Bagheri Mohammad read the sentence. Time in the house: She finished third in the Channel 4 series (pictured entering the house) and has since developed a property portfolio .","Aisleyne Horgan-Wallace, 35, was arrested while driving home from a party .

"By . Wills Robinson for MailOnline . Confusion: Craig Clamp, 27, managed to escape from officers at Aintree Hospital in Liverpool after he was arrested for stealing . A drug addict who was supposed to be under arrest managed to escape from police when officers guarded an elderly patient by mistake. Serial criminal Craig Clamp was arrested after being accused of stealing from a Morrisons Local supermarket in Formby on Merseyside. The 27-year-old started to feel unwell after swallowing a bag of heroin, so was taken to Aintree Hospital for his own safety. While he was being treated, police officers became confused and ended up watching another patient instead. Clamp used the opportunity to jump out of a window into the car park below, where he managed to flee. He was eventually captured five miles away in Bootle after 36 hours on the run, and has now been jailed for 17 weeks following the escape attempt. Michael Stephenson, prosecuting, told Liverpool Crown Court: 'Officers were put on the ward to supervise the prisoner. 'Just before 6am, a time of low attention for most people, two new officers came in to relieve those who had been on night duty. 'They saw their colleagues sitting at a table in the ward facing a man in bed. After discussion with them they took over their duties. 'Half an hour later a nurse asked where Mr Clamp was, had he gone to the toilet? Mr Clamp was not the man in the bed.' 'He had taken advantage of the confusion on the ward and climbed out of the window to escape. CCTV shows him moving at a fairly brisk trot across the car park. 'It’s at odds with the suggestion he woke up in a daze and wandered off.' He pleaded guilty to escaping from custody and the court heard he had a lengthy record including 12 previous breaches of bail conditions. Paul Lewis, defending, said: 'The two police officers who should have been guarding him were guarding the wrong man. 'That calamity allowed him to walk out of the hospital. It resulted in red faces on their behalf rather than any physical harm. Escpe: The serial offender managed to jump through a window at Aintree Hospital in Liverpool after officers started guarding an elderly patient by mistake . 'By his plea he has prevented the officers from having to come here and relive that embarrassment in front of a jury.' The patient who was mistaken for their prisoner was an elderly man who tried to offer the police guarding him his Werther’s Originals but they told him they could not accept gifts. Judge Norman Wright jailed Clamp, who was wearing a blue and yellow 'escape suit' for his court appearance, for 17 weeks. He said: 'It seems there was a change in shift of police officers and there was a misunderstanding as to which patient was the prisoner they were meant to be guarding. 'You seized upon that to effect your escape. You were at liberty for one and a half days.' The court heard that the original theft allegation Clamp was facing was not proceeded with. Detained: Clamp was arrested for allegedly stealing from a Morrisons Local in Formby on Merseyside .","Craig Clamp was arrested after being accused of stealing from a Morrisons .

"By . Martin Robinson for MailOnline . Children as young as six are regularly being exposed to violence and prostitution in video games because more than half of parents ignore age ratings, a new survey revealed today. Primary school children are playing titles like Grand Theft Auto (GTA) and Call of Duty for up to six hours a day despite many having an 18 certificate. One expert has said that a six-year-old boy asked her what a brothel was and where he could find one because you can solicit prostitutes in GTA. Scroll down for video . Survey: Primary school children are playing titles like Grand Theft Auto (pictured) for up to six hours a day despite many having an 18 certificate, exposing them to violence . Account: One expert said a six-year-old who played GTA, where you can pick up prostitutes, asked what a brothel was and where to find one . The survey of parents found 52 per cent with children aged six to 17 say that their child has played play video games when they are below the age limit. The survey conducted by YouGov for 5 News also revealed one in four parents notice a negative change in behaviour after their children played the games. One in three felt their offspring spent too much time playing games and it was getting in the way of physical activity. But 57 per cent said they believe their children can handle the content in the restricted games, even if though they are underage. Child Protection Expert, Sharon Girling, who gives presentations to schools on child safety said: 'In Grand Theft Auto you have pornography scenes whereby a person can go into a brothel. One six year old asked me what it was. 'I listen to the language that some of these young people are starting to use and they are not getting it from the television - they are actually getting it from the games. The teachers notice a change in behaviour.' Picture of Britain: Many parents admitted that they saw a change in behaviour by their children and counsellors believe an addiction to games can be a s strong as drugs . Mrs Girling believes part of the problem is that parents do not understand the games or know how graphic the content is even though it is labelled an 18. Broadway Lodge in Weston Super Mare was the first addiction clinic in the UK to adopt a programme for gaming addiction. Counsellor Peter Smith says it is as powerful as drug addiction and he comes across children so obsessed with games they are unable to sleep, and in one case a bucket under a desk to go to the toilet in. He said: 'There are some examples of young people who end up in hospital with conditions caused by sitting endlessly in one position playing away. 'We're building up some problems for the future with possibly some physical problems, repetitive strain injury, eye sight, dietary problems and health issues. Michael Rich, a paediatrician at Harvard medical School - Boston Children's hospital, has researched the issue. He says he sees three main impacts from kids who have been exposed to video game violence, becoming desensitised, increased fear and anxiety and in small numbers aggressive thoughts. He said: 'We're seeing kids developing anxiety disorders even post traumatic stress disorder when they haven't witness actual violence but have been involved in these video games.''We're seeing not only short term effects of increased aggression because these kids are immersed in an environment where they are rewarded for aggression, where all conflicts are resolved by aggression.'","Survey reveals 50% of parents allow their children to play 18 rated  games .

"By . Ashley Collman For Mailonline . Walmart has everything you could ever need, so why leave? That seems to be the idea one 14-year-old had when he was caught living in a 24-hour Walmart for two days. The teen went unnoticed for so long by constantly changing clothes and hiding in two carefully crafted secret forts behind the store's stockpiles of goods. Images obtained by KTVT show the two compounds, one located in the baby aisle behind boxes of stroller, and the other behind packages of paper towels and toilet paper. He sustained himself off stolen food from the store, cutting a hole in the wall behind the drink aisle to stay hydrated. Scroll down for video . Home away from home: Above is the makeshift bed one 14-year-old boy used to camp out in a Walmart for two days . Master of disguise: The unidentified boy eluded attention at the 24-hour store by changing clothes every few hours. Above, one of stash-piles found in the store . The unidentified teen constructed a make-shift bed, and even stole a fish from the store to keep as a pet. To elude the store's employees, the boy even wore a diaper so as not to be seen using the bathroom multiple times a day. According to press release from the Corsicana Police Department, the boy was being watched by his aunt on Monday, July 28, when he ran out the wrong door while she was watching TV. The aunt was watching the boy while his parents, from Rice, Texas, were out of town. She immediately reported him missing to police that afternoon and the mother confirmed that he had a history of running away. She told police he would often stay in creeks, abandoned buildings or businesses when he ran away. The boy was eventually found Wednesday night after customers noticed piles of trash around the store and alerted employees. Messy: The boy was finally caught when store employees found piles of trash around the store . Breakfast, lunch and dinner: The boy sustained himself for days on food stolen from the store . When he was caught, the boy attempted to flee the store but was stopped and has since been turned over to his relatives. CPS says they are usually called in to investigate cases like this but they haven't in this instance. Walmart isn't expected to file criminal charges. Company spokesman Brian Nick has issued a statement, saying: 'This is a sad situation and we are still looking into the details of what happened. As soon as the manager learned that child was hiding in our store we contacted authorities for help and we hope the child is safe.' His own private superstore: The boy has since been turned over to his relatives. The incident happened at a Walmart in Corsicana, Texas (pictured above) The 14-year-old who camped out in Walmart for two days, may have gotten the idea from the 2000 film Where the Heart Is. The movie, starring a young Natalie Portman, follows the life of 17-year-old Novalee Nation who is moving cross-country with her boyfriend when he abandons her at a Walmart in Oklahoma. With no money, and no where to go, seven-months-pregnant Novalee decides to make Walmart her home, and lives there for several weeks undetected. Inspiration? In the movie Where the Heart Is, Natalie Portman stars as Novalee Nation, a woman who hides for several weeks in an Oklahoma Walmart at the end of her pregnancy . She eludes store employees by hiding in . the bathroom each night before closing, calls a sleeping bag in the camping section her bed and considerately makes a list of all the items she's . stolen so that she can one day repay the debt. It is only when she gives birth to her daughter in the store in the middle of the night that she is eventually found. Instead of being mad at her for stealing merchandise for weeks, the president of Walmart gifts Novalee $500 after the birth and she eventually gets a job at the same store.","The unidentified teen was caught living in a 24-hour Walmart store in Corsicana, Texas .

"By . Bianca London for MailOnline . Yesterday Frank Maloney, the tough-talking promoter and manager who guided boxer Lennox Lewis to become a boxing world champion, spoke out for the first time about a secret he'd been hiding his whole life. She felt she was a woman trapped in a man's body and is currently undergoing gender reassignment, having changed her name to Kellie. One person that knows only too well the struggle of living life as the wrong sex is Helen Wright, who lived for over 50 years as Alan, a 'macho man' desperate to be female. Opening up: In light of Frank Maloney's revelation that he is undergoing gender reassignment, Helen Wright, pictured, appeared on This Morning to tell her similar tale . After Alan's lies led her into a dark depression and suicide attempt, she realised that she had to be true to herself and for the past seven years has happily lived as Helen. Speaking about how she empathises with Kellie on This Morning, Helen said the boxing promoter had been 'very brave' to speak out. She added of Kellie's plans for surgery: 'He's got to be 120 per cent certain that's what he wants because once the surgeons have done their work, there's no going back.' Speaking about her own experience, Helen said: 'I kept it secret all my life. You have to be a macho to prove to yourself that these things that are happening shouldn't be there.' Helen began to feel different at age of nine but refused to tell anyone what was going through her mind. Staying quiet: Helen worked as a truck driver and married a woman she met at school . Hiding a secret: Helen, pictured as Alan, knew there was something different about her from the age of nine but continued to live life as a man and even got married and had children . Coming out: One day Helen's wife found women's clothes in their house and Helen had to come clean but luckily she had a supportive network of friends . 'From an early age I started dressing in girl's clothes and as it went on, in secret all the time, I would hide in the bathroom and hide clothes so nobody knew,' she said. 'When I hit my teens, I felt that there was something wrong and thought ""Why should I be feeling like this? I'm a lad. It shouldn't be happening to me.""' Helen went on to live life as a man, working in the 'macho' industry of truck driving with her own haulage business. Helen even tied the knot with a woman she had met at school; they went on to be married for thirty years and had children and several grandchildren. Macho man: Helen went on to live life as a man, working in the 'macho' industry of truck driving with her own haulage business . Happy at last: Speaking on This Morning, Helen said she feels happy and as though she's got a second bite of the cherry . 'We had many happy years together. We had up and downs like everyone else,' said Helen of the marriage. 'However', she adds, 'the older I was getting, the worse I was becoming. The more and more Helen wanted to be there, Alan was getting shut out.' One day, her wife found some women's clothes in their bedroom and she had to come clean. 'She thought I was having an affair but I told her exactly what was what,' said Helen. 'We tried to talk about it but we could never really discuss it. It was at the point where it was never going to be accepted.' When Helen told her parents, the shock, she says, was that they already knew. Her greatest fight: Boxing promoter Frank Maloney, who guided fighter Lennox Lewis to the peak of the sport, is now living as a woman called Kellie, left . Helen, who says she never had any inkling of being gay, says she isn't doing this for love. 'I haven't done this because I wanted a man in my life, I've done this because of who I should've been from birth. 'There won't be men in Helen's life, I don't think. I'm not closed off to it, if I meet somebody, it would be companionship.' Speaking about how coming out has changed her life, she added: 'I've got good friends, both male and female, who've all stuck by me. I had to do something about what happened to me, or I wouldn't be here.' While she hasn't seen her grandchildren in the past year, she added: 'At the end of the day, it's my life, I've got to have a life. I'm happy now. I've got a second bite of the cherry.'","Alan is now living as Helen .

"By . Eleanor Gower . Mischa Barton may be under under threat of foreclosure, but her father Paul isn’t worried. In an exclusive interview with MailOnline, Paul Barton said of his daughter's mortgage issues, 'I'm not worried about it. It's not a big sum of money. Deutsche Bank doesn't seem to be bothered by it, so I'm not.' The former O.C. starlet, now 28,  could lose her $7.1 million Beverly Hills estate if she doesn't pay the $100k in back mortgage payments she owes, according to TMZ.Scroll down for video . Vape vamp: Mischa Barton's father is not worried about his daughter losing her home. She's got a trendy London boutque, a bunch of films in the works and she's just been named as the lead judge of VAPESTICK Style Icon, a UK campaign to find the county's most stylish e-cig vaper . Lavish: Mischa has been trying to unload the $7.1m property for several years. Her parents are living in the eight bedroom house while Mischa is in London . 'I actually didn't know she was behind [in her mortgage payments]. Mischa will pay it. I'm not concerned, really,' says dad Paul, who took up full time residency in his daughter's home with wife Nuala in 2009 when the couple attempted an intervention. Mischa threatened suicide while under the influence of a sedative which landed her in the same psychiatric ward as Britney Spears -- Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. She was placed under an involuntary 5150 hold for three days after she threatened to end her life. Coincidentally enough, Mischa's mansion sits across the street from Britney's former Summit estate. 'Mischa lives in London now. She hasn't been here in weeks. There's only the two of us living here and it's 10,000 square feet. We'd like to sell the house. We love it here, but let's be real, it's a little big.' Property records show the hilltop home,  behind the prestigious gated Bowmont Estates, has eight bedrooms,11 bathrooms, and boasts sprawling views from downtown L.A. to the Pacific Coast's Catalina Island. Proud papa: Mischa  and her dad Paul Barton are so close he and her mom Nuala live in Mischa's Beverly Hills home. But Paul says he wasn't aware there was a threat of foreclosure on the mansion . She was 'it': Dubbed the 'It Girl' in the mid 2000's, Mischa says she wasn't as grateful for her role in The O.C. as she should have been . 'She'll do it. She's just a little behind, that's all,' Paul added. Barton hit her Hollywood peak in the mid-2000s, starring as the sexy Marissa Cooper in 76 episodes of The O.C. After her 2007 D.U.I. arrest and the mental ward hold two years later, Mischa switched gears into fashion with her own line of handbags, cosmetics and clothes. Her London shop, Mischa's Place, sits on in the trendy Spitalfields Market on Brushfield Street. When asked about his daughter's current life outside of Hollywood, Paul said, ""' don't know what my daughter does. She dates a lot of people. She's always working and traveling to buy items for her shop. She's a grown woman. I don't have to keep tabs on her.' After her flicker of fame began to fade following the cancellation The O.C. due to poor ratings, Mischa re-tooled her career, taking on several smaller roles on TV and in film. Mischa has a whopping 17 projects in development, and seven films currently in production. She made 17 films since 2007, with none grossing more than $38 million. Mischa, who told the British Metro newspaper that she wasn't as grateful for her involvement in the TV hit as she should be, will also head up a nationwide campaign to find Britain's most stylish vaper for e-cigarette brand VAPESTICK. The new pictures of the interior of the eight bedroom pad show Barton's tastes, with the master bedroom featuring blue walls, green draped curtains and mustard coloured linen on the four poster bed. All bright: Inside Mischa Barton's eight bedroom mansion which is under threat of foreclosure after the star allegedly fell behind on her mortgage payments . Trouble: Mischa Barton, pictured in London back in June, is struggling to keep up with her mortgage repayments, according to TMZ . The 7,607-square-foot Spanish-style gated home has views of Catalina Island, according to Zillow. It also features 11 bathrooms and a nearly 3,000 square foot guesthouse. Barton seems fond of retro style furniture, with the dining room dotted with vintage chairs on a black and white checked floor teamed with orange coloured walls and a chandelier. Grecian style white stone columns sit beneath the large wooden dining table, while velvet drapes and overhead spotlights finish the room. The carpeted lounge has a more cosy feel with several beige coloured couches alongside bright citrus cushions and yellow walls, combined with Barton's favourite matching drapes. The kitchen is also painted buttercup yellow, with wooden beans across the ceiling teamed with a wrought iron chandelier, a country style tiled floor and varnished wooden units. A larder with artfully distressed white wooden units are full of the slim actress's favourite foods including organic vegetable broth and tinned fruit. The exterior of the home is no less opulent, with a large rectangular swimming pool sitting alongside beautiful bougainvillea, an immaculate lawn and patio area. And the outer stone wall of the two storey main house is covered with ivy. Ornate décor: Mischa's tastes seem to run to rather gaudy looking paint, clashing chandeliers and  vintage chairs .

"By . Bianca London for MailOnline . A diving-mad couple have taken the plunge - and tied the knot 30ft underwater. With the bride in her wedding dress and groom in his suit, the adventurous American couple swam down the aisle, before saying 'I do'. Bill Frenier, 52, and Lizbeth Espejo Frenier, 32, decided to hold their wedding in the Atlantic Ocean, just off the coast of Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Scroll down for video . One wet wedding! Bill Frenier and Lizbeth Espejo Frenier tied the knot deep in the Atlantic Ocean, just off the coast of Fort Lauderdale, Florida . The undersea ceremony was conducted by a scuba-clad justice of the peace and the couple exchanged both rings and vows in the presence of their friends and family. The wedding congregation even included a couple of curious sharks. Lizbeth, a funeral director, said: 'Our ""real"" wedding was in Las Vegas this past November, but many of our friends couldn't attend since it was really far. You may kiss the bride! The ceremony was conducted by a scuba-clad Justice of the Peace and the couple exchanged both rings and vows in the presence of their friends and family - and a few curious sharks who swam past . Deep love: The couple  had a ""real"" wedding  in Las Vegas this past November, but many of their friends couldn't attend since it was really far for them to travel so they held one under the sea as well . Guests: Scuba-clad guests swam from the shore to the site of the ceremony to watch the diving fans tie the knot . 'So, since Bill and I are avid divers, and most of our friends are too, we thought it would be a great idea to do it all again underwater.' The wedding was a shore dive, which meant most of the guests swam from the shore to the site of the ceremony. The service was attended by twenty guests and most were able to watch the ceremony fully submerged, with the aid of oxygen masks, goggles, and scuba gear underneath their regular outfits. The less experienced divers had the option to snorkel and watch from the surface.

William and Lizbeth's nuptials lasted 15 minutes before the happy couple enjoyed a beach BBQ with their loved ones. Meeting by chance in Las Vegas in 2008, Lizbeth moved from her home state of California to live with Bill in Florida, where she quickly adopted his love of diving. 'Bill has dived for over twenty years,' said Lizbeth. 'He had a great idea that I sign up for a dive class with him accompanying me for support.'

Still in tact: Lizbeth simply soaked her wedding dress in laundry soap, which, she says, cleaned up the seawater smell completely . The couple were forced to cancel the original date of their underwater wedding due to choppy seas. This June, however, the weather was on their side and the sea remained still. Lizbeth said: 'All of the family and friends were super excited when I told them about the idea for the wedding, most thought it was such a unique concept and a great idea. 'I thought I would have to throw my wedding gown away after the dive. Miraculously, it's not in bad shape. 'Soaking it in laundry soap cleaned up the seawater smell completely!

"By . Joshua Gardner . and Eleanor Gower . Proud dad Brian Williams took a moment while anchoring NBC Nightly News to reveal his actress daughter's newest role, and the way he did it couldn't have been funnier. Allison Williams, 26, won the lead in Peter Pan in NBC's holiday live telecast of the children's favorite and appears to have been born for the part. Dad Brian deadpanned the news Wednesday evening, telling viewers, 'Family members confirm she's been rehearsing for this role since the age of 3 and they look forward to seeing her fly.' Scroll down for video . Proud dad: NBC Nightly News host Brian Williams on Wednesday proudly announced the casting of his own daughter as Peter Pan in December's live telecast of the play . 'Thrilled to be playing Peter Pan live on NBC in December,' Williams wrote with an adorable Instagram shot from her childhood. 'I've been rehearsing for a REALLY long time' The hilarious reveal from the newsman came just hours after Williams herself told fans how thrilled she was to have won the role she's wanted since childhood. 'I have wanted to play Peter Pan since I was about three years old, so this is a dream come true,' Allison said in a statement. As proof, she shared an Instagram photo of herself as a little girl dressed in full Peter Pan costume. 'Thrilled to be playing Peter Pan live on NBC in December,' she wrote with the photo. 'I’ve been rehearsing for a REALLY long time.' 'I have wanted to play Peter Pan since I was about three years old, so this is a dream come true,' Allison said in a statement .

'Eventually I'd like to do more performing of my own kinds of music,' she added. The TV spectacular will be based on the original 1954 Broadway musical which includes songs Never Never Land and Hook's Tango. NBC will be hoping for another hit following last year's success of The Sound of Music Live which featured Carrie Underwood as Maria Von Trapp. Casting has yet to be announced for other key roles including Smee, Wendy Darling and Tinkerbell - after Miley Cyrus shot down reports she was being lined up for the fairy role.

"By . Katy Winter for MailOnline . A group of Nottingham Trent University alumni and friends helped one man ask the most important question of his life. Nicholas Hugh Laughton, 29, decided to pop the question to girlfriend Cherie Leanne Amner, 27, in a less than conventional way. Rather than a candle-lit dinner and getting down on one knee, Nick spend over 10 months planning and filming a video to ask for Cherie’s hand in marriage, involving all their family and friends, and featuring all the special places in their relationship. Nicholas Hugh Laughton and fiancee Cherie Leanne Amner make a toast to their engagement moments after Nick popped the question . Nick spent an astonishing 10 months filming and planning the video, keeping it all secret from Cherie . The video, which took months to make, begins with Nick sending out a text to family and friends . Cherie's friends are seen receiving Nick's text from all around the world, before rushing to the venue . Nick told his girlfriend of seven years that they were going back to their old student union for a friend's party, but that he would be late and join her there. As Cherie waited at the party with some of her friends, the proposal video began to play on the screen. From he and his university friends riding a tank, to the Nottingham Trent University cheerleaders doing a routine, Nick fills the video with in-jokes and memories shared by the couple. Speaking to MailOnline, Nick said of his ambitious project: ‘Ultimately the idea came from the notion that I wanted a proposal that turned immediately into the engagement party. The couple, seen here graduating together from Nottingham Trent University, have been together for over seven years . ‘The proposal itself was designed to take Cherie back to the origins of our relationship - which was our time at NTU and the video was a way of making our closest friends and immediate family a part of it. ‘Once I'd made the realisation that a video was going to be the platform for the proposal I approached a friend who owns his own media production company Janno Productions. 'It was at that point that the project really stepped up a notch because Wallace was able to take all of my crazed ideas and turn it into a realistically achievable and exceptionally professional production.’ The film starts with Cherie’s friends and family around the world – from Sydney to Dubai to London - receiving a text from Nick telling them that ‘Project Vegas’ will happen that evening. We see . each person rushing to the venue, including Nick’s ‘Trent Army’ university friends piling into a military tank to make their way to . Nottingham.

Eventually . friends hold up letters spelling out ‘You had better say yes’ before the . camera meets Nick walking to the Union to meet Cherie in ‘real time’, . flowers in hand, accompanied by her loved ones. ‘It . was crucial to me that the level of detail in the video meant Cherie . could watch it again and again discovering new bits of hidden meaning . the more she watched it. A group of the couple's friends don war paint and military gear to ride a tank to the venue . For the couple, who met at Nottingham Trent, their university has a special significance for them - so their friends dusted off their university cheer-leading outfits for the video . Roping in musician friends, the video is accompanied trumpets at some points . 'As a result, every single person featured in the video is a friend or family member of Cherie's and virtually every single prop in shot at any one time has a story behind it which holds hidden meaning to Cherie. 'There are points in the video where you have to pause it just to see the detail but that adds a whole other layer of enjoyment to it for Cherie and there are still certain things she's yet to discover. ‘The web of lies and misdirection I had to concoct to keep Cherie in the dark was something of a marvel. Over the course of the production I was living a double life and even made fake train tickets to cover my tracks. ‘Above and beyond everything though our friends and family were amazing at misleading Cherie; there were numerous staged conversations designed purely to plant fictitious notions in Cherie's head, and for a period of 10 months there was around 80 people in a Cherie's life who could at any moment have spilled the beans!’ However, Nick’s complex scheme worked, as, when the video began to play at what Cherie believed was a friend’s birthday party she was absolutely caught off guard. The video eventually sees friends hold up letters spelling out 'You had better say yes!!' ‘I wasn't suspicious in the slightest, we both work long hours so I never questioned it - even in the final lead up I thought I was in Nottingham for a friend's birthday and was never given any reason to question it. ‘At the beginning I thought I was watching a video for our friend Wallace who's birthday party it supposedly was - when the alarm went off I thought the sound system had broken - it wasn't until one of my best friends from Australia appeared on the screen that I realised it was too personal to me to be for anyone else. I suddenly thought to myself ""oh my goodness is this it, is Nick proposing?"" ‘I think what I was most overwhelmed at was the efforts everyone had gone to, to create something so truly amazing - I haven't stopped smiling from that moment, my cheeks even now ache. ‘ . The couple, who live together in Greenwich, London , met when they were both students at Nottingham University. The he camera meets Nick walking to the Union to meet Cheri, who is waiting indidifr yjre in 'real time' Nick strides into the union, where Cherie is waiting, flanked by friends, to pop the question . When Nick arrives at the union he pulls Cherie on stage and gets down on one knee. After the video, unsurprisingly, she says yes . Cherie says: ‘Nick and I became good friends but there was one night in particular in the old NTSU where Nick was a bit worse for wear, had wandered off to the bathroom and against my better judgement I confided my concern in a mutual friend saying ""Don't tell him but I think I like Nick?!"" ‘As soon as Nick reappeared our friend immediately called out ""Nick - Cherie fancies you!"" to which Nick somewhat vacantly responded ""brilliant"" - and that was essentially the beginning of our relationship!' The pair plan to marry in 2016, but Cherie says the proposal is something she will remember forever . ‘The efforts of Nick, Wallace, and all my friends and family put into helping create the most magical moment of my life is something I will never forget and I feel very blessed to have such incredible friends and family and of course my amazing fiancé - I am so excited for the next chapter of our future together!’","Nick and Cherie have been dating for seven years, having met at university .

"By . Katy Winter for MailOnline . A woman who was so fat she struggled to fit through the door and was given less than four years to live has shed a staggering 22st. Jane Smythe Longhurst, 46, tipped the scales at 36st, was left housebound as she struggled to walk - or even stand. Unable to stand long enough to cook herself a meal, the mother-of-three spent her evenings gorging on takeaways and piling on the pounds. Scroll down for video . At 36st (left) Jane could barely fit through doors, but following her 22st loss (right) she is a new woman . At her heaviest, Jane, from Langley near Manchester, wasn’t even able to wash herself and was totally dependent on her daughter, Melissa Longhurst, 23, to care for her and bring her meals. Jane said: 'I was in such a rut, for years I would pick at food all day and then eat takeaways at night. 'I didn’t go out the house because I was just so embarrassed that my daughter was my carer. 'When I got really big, I lived on takeaways primarily as I couldn’t get up and stand to cook a meal as I was in constant pain, it was horrendous. 'A seat belt in a car wouldn’t fit and when I had pictures taken I noticed I was wider than the doors.' With her weight spiralling out of control, Jane was diagnosed with pulmonary stenosis, oedema, high blood pressure and arthritis in her arms, spine, neck and legs. At her heaviest (left) Jane was unable to stand long enough to cook a meal and when doctors told her weight was threatening her life she decided to undergo gastric bypass surgery (right, in hospital) Jane now says her next challenge is to have the 3st of excess skin removed before her wedding day . Unable to even leave her home, doctors told her she would be dead within four years if she didn’t alter her eating habits and significantly reduce her weight. But in November 2012, she had a gastric bypass which helped her to drop an incredible 22st - saving her life. She said: 'I had written letters to my family just in case I didn’t make it as there was a real possibility I wouldn’t. 'I was obviously very anxious at the time, but the operation was a complete success, I suffered no complications and was home the next day. When Jane holds up her old clothing, the sheer scale of her weight loss is visible . 'The week after my operation, I found out I was going to be a nana for the first time, I was so happy.' Jane, who is the youngest of five children, says she was spoilt as a child and started to gradually gain weight at age 11. By the time she reached adulthood, she started to binge excessively on chocolate, crisps and late night takeaways, ignoring her parents’ advice to lose weight through exercising and dieting. In one desperate bid to lose weight, she even attempted to starve herself, but Jane, who had to buy specially made clothes on EBay, was unable to keep her weight down. As well as the surgery shrinking the size of her stomach, Jane has totally changed her diet, swapping takeaways for fresh healthy food . And when she met her now fiancé, Mark Alvis, 49, her body mass index (BMI) soared to a massive 89.6 - more than 60 units above the recommended average for an adult. But it was only when Jane reached her heaviest that she was referred to a weight management specialist who secured her funding for the gastric band operation. Dr Alan Li of Spire Manchester Hospital carried out the surgery and through a strict diet of mainly fruit and vegetables, Jane managed to shed a staggering 22st. She said: 'I love being able to buy clothes from normal shops for the first time. Curry . Pizza . Chocolate . Crisps . Pies . Bags of sweets . Chips . KFC . McDonald’s . Pepsi Max . Cakes . Biscuits . Fish . Chicken . Tuna . Beef . Salad . Fruit . Cereal . Cottage cheese . Crackers . Skimmed milk . Nuts . Homemade vegetable stews . 'I haven’t even thought about eating any chocolate or anything sweet since my bypass. 'I am determined I was given an opportunity to change my life, so that’s exactly what I’m doing. 'I can now see a future with my children, grandchild and husband to be.' Following her remarkable weight loss, Jane’s partner Mark from Bristol, proposed in February this year and she said her next challenge is to have the 3st of excess skin removed before her wedding day. She still suffers from arthritis and takes medication to keep her blood pressure down, but after years of obesity Jane is now able to spend more time with her one-year-old grandchild, Amelia Jane and said she is determined to grab life with both hands.

"By . Katy Winter for MailOnline . Father-of-six Mark Hughes lost everything when she came out as transgender women Abby-Grace. Like boxing promoter Frank Maloney, Abby-Grace struggled to fight her feminine urges for years before making the transition. When she eventually summoned the courage to come out, her parents disowned her and her oldest two daughters stopped speaking to her - but Abby says she's never been happier. Scroll down for video . After years of feeling trapped in the wrong body, Mark (L) finally began living as Abby (R) The 47-year-old had known all of her life that she had the mind of a woman, but it wasn't until last year that she started living as one. The Mancunian ex-window cleaner, who now lives in Idaho, America, has left her old life - and her children - behind to start afresh as Abby. She says she 'cries every day' to be separated from her children, but her new life means that she hasn't seen them for almost a year. 'My children mean the world to me,' said Abby. 'I'd have stayed as Mark if that meant being with them but after I was diagnosed with gender dysphoria my ex-wife asked me to leave. 'If I hadn't transitioned I honestly think I would have died. 'I've had three nervous breakdowns and I'd even contemplated suicide because living as a man made me so miserable. Abby (as Mark, left aged 10, right aged 23) was so unhappy as a man she had three nervous breakdowns . Abby still living as Mark (centre), while playing with an eighties rock group in Manchester . 'It is difficult to be so far away from them but at least this way I'll see them grow up. Speaking of Maloney, Abby said: 'I know exactly how she feels. 'It must have taken some courage for her to come out as transgender in such a macho industry. 'I've went through the same thing and I know how she must have suffered with it throughout her whole life. 'I wish her all the best and all of the luck in the world.' Abby initially flew to the States on holiday, to recover after a breakdown in August last year. She stayed with a transsexual friend, Dahlia, whom she had met online, but eventually decided that being in America was best for her recovery and never came back. The only contact she has had with her children since has been over Skype. Abby put her doubts to the back of her mind and went on to marry a woman called Winnie. When Abby was 25 her first daughter was born . But although the younger children, aged three, five, and seven, are more than happy to have Abby in their lives, her two oldest daughters, aged 18 and 16, refuse to have any contact with her. 'It's devastating,"" said Abby. 'I've never done anything but love them. 'But after I started living as a woman they didn't want anything to do with me. 'Because they're female, I thought they might be able to understand but they don't want to know. 'I just hope that as they get older and more mature they'll come around.' For as long as Abby can remember, she was drawn to girls' clothes and toys but was made to feel guilty for her behaviour. Although the younger children, aged three, five, and seven, (pictured) are more than happy to have Abby in their lives, her two oldest daughters, aged 18 and 16, refuse to have any contact with her . But Abby put her doubts to the back of her mind and continued to live as a man. She went on to marry a woman called Winnie and their first daughter was born. She said: 'We married and had three beautiful children, but all the while the stress and anxiety was slowly building. 'When I was 28 it all became too much and I had my first breakdown. 'Winnie and I drifted apart and after 12 years together we separated.' After the breakdown of the marriage, Mark, then 35, met her second wife, Kelly, and the couple went on to have three sons. Abby says that despite being disowned by her parents and two eldest daughters, she has never been happier (pictured right with transgendered friend Dahlia) 'I have always identified as bisexual but I was more attracted to women and have never been intimate with a man,"" said Abby. 'I fell madly in love with Kelly and I was desperate to have more children.' In 2012, when she was 44, the dysphoria became unbearable and Abby had another breakdown. It was so severe that Abby struggled to speak and couldn't even remember her children's names. She knew that the time had finally come to confide in a doctor about what had been plaguing her for so many years. In January 2013, Abby and Kelly separated and Abby, then 45, decided to take the plunge and start living full-time as a woman. Despite losing contact with her parents and having to start a new life in America, Abby says she has never been happier . Abby, pictured here with transgender friends Dahlia (far left) and Annie, is planning on paying the $17,000 fee for the gender reassignment operation in March next year using money from the sale of her house . She started taking hormones and developed breasts within a few months. But despite finally feeling comfortable in her skin, Abby struggled to be accepted by others. She said: 'I briefly stayed with my sister in Huddersfield but she turned against me suddenly and kicked me out on the street. 'I had lost my job as a window cleaner when I had been ill and I was penniless. 'My parents didn't want to know and I had nowhere else to turn. 'Everyone had turned their back on me.' In August 2013 Abby flew to America to start her new life. She has now been taking hormones for over a year and has developed 36C breasts without surgery. And despite being offered full funding for gender reassignment in the UK, she is paying the $17,000 fee for the operation in March next year using money from the sale of her house. Abby said: 'I lived in the wrong body for over 40 years to keep other people happy and I almost killed myself in the process. 'But now I'm finally focusing on me.'","Abby also felt she was in the wrong body, but ignored feelings .

"By . Katy Winter for MailOnline . As the level-headed detective at the centre of BBC’s hit crime thriller The Killing, Sofie Grabol is rarely seen without the patterned jumper that has become her trademark. Detective Sarah Lund’s quirky fashion sense spawned a revival of chunky knitwear in high street fashion. But now designers Gudrun & Gudrun have lost a battle against Danish company Stof og Sy over copyright of their famous ‘Lund’ jumper design. Scroll down for video . Character detective Sarah Lund has become as known for her chunky knit jumpers as her cool demeanor . Demand for the traditional style of jumper has sky rocketed since The Killing was picked up by the BBC in 2011 . Makers of the jumper, Faroese based company Gudrun & Gudrun, have argued they have an exclusive right over the distinctive star pattern, after Stof og Sy produced a similar, much cheaper, jumper. While an original Gudrun & Gudrun Lund jumper will set you back £240, the ‘knit it yourself’ kit sold by Stof og Sy is just £40. The Observer reports that representative for Stof og Sy, Lene Langballe, argued in court that the history behind the pattern meant that despite Gudrun & Gudrun’s protests, they were perfectly within their right to produce it themselves. The Faroese jumpers worn by lone wolf Sarah Lund are knitted on the island group and archipelago which sits under the sovereignty of the Kingdom of Denmark and is situated between the Norwegian Sea and the North Atlantic Ocean, approximately halfway between Norway and Iceland. The unusual patterns stitched into the sweaters are a traditional Faroese marking, originally used by the fishermen's wives to distinguish their husbands as they approached the shore after long periods working at sea. Detective Sarah Lund's quirky fashion sense spawned a revival of chunky knitwear in high street fashion . Viewers in both Britain and Denmark, where the series originated, have become enamoured with the look, clamouring to get their hands on similar jumpers. ‘Everybody wanted that sweater,’ says Sofie. ‘The company in the Faroe Islands that makes them couldn’t keep up.’ The jumper was Sofie’s idea after producers said they wanted to avoid the cliche of the woman in a suit in a man’s world. ‘I saw the sweater and I just knew,’ she says. ‘It tells so many things about the character. It tells of a woman who has so much confidence in herself that she doesn’t have to use her sex to get what she wants. She works in a cynical world, but the sweater says that maybe deep down there’s a longing to, I don’t know, sit around a fire with a guitar.’ Unbelievably there is even an entire website devoted to the jumper. Sarahlundsweater.com details where fans can buy both the original Gudrun & Gudrun sweater used in the show as well as cheaper alternatives, as well as information about the show and how to knit your own version of the Lund.","Famous star knitwear worn by actress Sofie Grabol in The Killing .

"By . Jenna Good For Daily Mail Australia . Just a day after telling Daily Mail Australia that she keeps herself in shape by working out on her home gym and has a love for cheeses and desserts, Rebecca Judd has created a storm by posting a picture of herself looking shockingly thin on Instagram. The model, mother and TV presenter posed in a bikini after having a spray tan - and showed off her super thin frame. Her hips are clearly visible and her legs are amazingly slender. The image sparked a mixed reaction from the 31 year old's 196,000 Instagram followers, with some saying she had gone too far. Others insisted she looked healthy. Scroll down for video . Too thin? Rebecca caused a stir on Instagram with these pictures of herself just six months after giving birth to her second child, Billie Kate . While many of her fans were outraged by the image of Rebecca in a colourful strapless bikini, others stood up for the Melbourne-based star, who is married to AFL player Chris Judd. In the picture taken on her phone, fitness fanatic Rebecca’s slim figure appears lean and toned. One user asked: ‘How is this nice? Way too skinny.’ Glamorous: The sultry model looked gorgeous as she walked the red carpet at the Myer Spring/Summer 2014 collection launch on Thursday night . Meanwhile @wendyrpaton said: ‘I like following you Bec but please reconsider the message you are sending to young impressionable women. ‘You don't need to flaunt yourself like this. Use your beauty in a positive way and a less self-indulgent. I do think you are inspirational, please consider your message. Eating disorders are real and effect many young girls.’ @minnapurdue said: ‘Eat something. Unfollowed.’ Transformation: The 31-year-old uploaded a this shot of herself to show how her body had bounced back just three weeks after having Billie . And @cina_bina wrote: ‘Omg @kaylahayes5 I would rather look the way I do now than look like this, this is so sad 💀 poor girl.’ Meanwhile @laus_sull reasoned: ‘While I don't agree with all the negative comments and do believe she is genetically blessed (and exercises and eats well), I also believe surely she must have expected she would get these comments from this photo, whether they are warranted or not.’ @georgiahad typed: ‘Moving along from ridiculous negative comments, loving the tan!’ By the pool: Three months ago Rebecca uploaded a slim shot of herself in a bikini by the pool . And not everyone agreed with the backlash. @gabstarflossy added: ‘I think you look beautiful @becjudd don't listen to the haters. Some of these negative comments are appalling. Some people have no idea when they say stupid things about other people.’ And renata_angarano_makeup said: ‘Well done @becjudd. Your discipline and healthy choices should be taken as inspirational. I can only wish to have as much discipline as you. To all the haters - if you all committed yourselves to exercise as much as you do to bitching, maybe, just maybe, you would be happy with yourselves too.’ Beauty: Rebecca and her husband AFL star Chris Judd looked happy as they appeared on the red carpet together in February . Rebecca’s weight has been a talking point in the past after she has lost her baby weight very quickly. In May, just three months after giving birth to her daughter Billie Kate, the television presenter uploaded a slim bikini shot of herself showing she had already bounced back. But on Thursday the brunette told Daily Mail Australia that morphing into her post-baby shape in record time was all down to hard work. Family time: A few hours after uploading the shot of herself in a bikini, Rebecca shared a snap of herself with Billie Kate . 'It's all about Pilates, Pilates, Pilates, Pilates,' she said. 'I wish I could run but I just don't have time. And I just work out on (husband) Chris' reformer equipment all the time, in his man cave. And there's a spin bike down there I use... it's all about being fit and strong and toned.' And despite sweating it out in the gym, she says she credits her figure to her mother. As a presenter on Channel Nine's Postcards, food is all part of the job, including decadent desserts and yummy cheeses and Rebecca said: . 'I eat all of it! With my role on Postcards sometimes we eat all day long. 'I'm lucky I've got my mum's body type and we can eat whatever we like. I need to work at putting on weight and muscle not losing it,' she said. Rebecca gave birth to her daughter Billie Kate in January and son Oscar three years before. The busy working mum appeared to ignore the comments and instead posted a shot of herself with baby Billie three hours later.","Judd posted picture of herself in a bikini after she had a spray tan .

"By . Pete D'amato . Any reunion between two war buddies is bound to be emotional, but after a nationwide search brought together a U.S. Marine Corps Veteran with the bomb-sniffing dog he served with, tears and wags were in order. Lance Cpl. Dylan Bogue served in Afghanistan for seven months with the black lab Moxie, but hadn't seen his former partner for two years. 'I'm very happy, very grateful for the people that made this come together. It's really truly a dream,' Bogue told WHDH. Scroll down for video . Companion: Lance Cpl. Dylan Bogue had not seen his former partner Moxie for two years after the pair served together in Afghanistan . Bogue and Moxie were paired up at a training course in North Carolina in 2011 before being deployed to Afghanistan, where they worked to detect improvised explosive devices. Still, Bogue insists that Moxie did more than just protect his unit from bombs. 'It was comforting and reassuring to myself and my unit to have a dog there in the stressful situations of a combat deployment,' he told the Boston Herald. Bogue said that he suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder, and believes that Moxie does too. After returning to the U.S., Moxie began working with Boston's transit police and was an integral part of security at this year's marathon, searching for explosives on Boston's metro line. 'We did a lot of security work leading up to the last Boston Marathon, we were all over that Green Line,' said Chip Leonard, the handler who gave up Moxie. Comfort canine: Bogue says that he and Moxie have PTSD but that his partner's presence with his unit was 'reassuring' Service dog: Moxie will be with civilian dogs when he returns to Bogue's home. Here he dozes with Bogue and his unit. At the handover ceremony on Wednesday, Leonard was emotional as he saluted Bogue and said goodbye to his trusted partner. 'This was probably one of the toughest things I've ever gone through,' he told WBZ. Leonard later posted to Facebook that Bogue has 'got his good pal back with him.' The reunion was made possible by Vietnam vet Lon Hodge, who sent out a call to find Moxie through his blog where he writes about the importance of service dogs to veterans' well-being. Now that Moxie is retired from service, he'll join the civilian canines at Bogue's home, which include three pit bulls and an Australian shepherd.","U.S. Marine Corps Lance Cpl.

"By . Will Stewart . Vladimir Putin is under pressure to put 'peacekeeping' troops on the ground in Ukraine as NATO accused the Kremlin of posing 'a threat to the international order'. Separatists supporting Moscow in eastern Ukraine called on the Russian president to put soldiers into Donetsk and Lugansk regions to maintain order. A call for peacekeeping forces also came from the head of the Russian parliament's defence committee Admiral Vladislav Komoyedov. Scroll down for video . Troops: Separatists supporting Moscow in eastern Ukraine have called on Russian president Vladimir Putin (pictured today with Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas) to put soldiers into Donetsk and Lugansk regions to maintain order . Residents wait as they charge their mobile phones at a kiosk with a rare working power outlet in Slavyansk on Wednesday. There is no electricity or running water in most of the city . Russia's upper house today approved a Putin demand to remove his authority to deploy his armed forces in Ukraine, but the calls for peacekeepers indicate many have not ruled out its troops on the ground in eastern Ukraine. The Kremlin leader has been seen as backtracking this week to avoid harsh new Western sanctions, but the latest demands will disturb leaders in the EU and US. Donetsk separatist leader Pavel Gobarev urged: 'We ask for the deployment of a Russian peacekeeping contingent in the Donetsk People's Republic and the Lugansk People's Republic.' In the event of international peacekeepers, Putin's forces 'must play the leading role', he said. Komoyedov warned that the week-long ceasefire was not holding in eastern Ukraine, highlighted by the downing of a Ukrainian military helicopter in which nine died. 'Who can at present reliably control the situation between sides to the conflict in southeast Ukraine? I think that an interposition force could fulfill this task,' he demanded.

It is Moscow's 'illegal actions in Ukraine which pose a threat to the international order'. NATO has accused Russia of increasing its troop numbers close to Ukraine's borders and proving weaponry and fighters to rebel forces. 'Today, we see no changes in Russia's behaviour. So we have no options but to maintain the suspension of practical civilian and military cooperation.

"By . Paul Donnelley for MailOnline . It's supposed to be the happiest holiday of your life – when you and your loved one have a wonderful time and want to share your good times with friends and family and recently thanks to social media the world at large. At least that is what a Neapolitan woman thought when she posted photographs of her honeymoon on her Facebook page. Following a marital row her husband demanded that the photographs be taken down because he had not given his permission and even took his wife to court to force the issue. Scroll down for video . If only the pictures posted online had been as unobtrusive as these (File photo) Now a Naples court has not only agreed with him but the wife may have to pay him damages. The pictures were taken on the couple's honeymoon 10 years ago and included photos of the pair cuddling and kissing. In her defence, the wife's lawyer claimed that 'the use of social networks is now so advanced that we can consider a Facebook wall to be not unlike a private photo album'. To her horror the court found that the publication of a photo on the internet is 'significantly worse' than any other form of publication because privacy cannot be guaranteed by the user. The court in Naples (above) found for the husband and now he may receive damages from his wife (File photo) The court found that the woman had broken Article 10 of the civil code and 'certainly violated the right to privacy of her husband'. She also fell foul of legislation from 1941 which says that the portrait of a person cannot be displayed, reproduced or sold without the subject's consent. The decision was welcomed by the husband's lawyer, Ciro Renino, who said: 'It's an unprecedented decision, which will provide a point of reference for Facebook users.'","After a row, he demanded she take down the 10-year-old photographs .

Bethenny Frankel, the reality star turned Skinnygirl mogul, has been accused of setting a bad example to her young daughter after the 43-year-old posted a photo of herself online wearing her 4-year-old’s pajamas. The former Real Housewives of New York City star posted the photo on Instagram on Sunday of her wearing daughter Bryn Hoppy's Hello Kitty themed sleepwear of ruffled pink top multi-coloured shorts and matching fluffy slippers. She wrote: ‘This is my daughter's nightgown and PJ shorts. Think we're ready to start sharing clothes yet?’ Scroll down for video . Bethenny Frankel, the reality star turned Skinnygirl mogul, has been accused of sending a bad message to her young daughter after the 43-year-old posted a photo of herself online wearing her 4-year-old daughter's pajamas . But if the author of a book called Naturally Thin thought she was being funny, many of her followers didn’t agree. The photo has already attracted more than 600 comments many accusing Frankel of sending the wrong kind of message. ‘This makes me sick to my stomach!!! #eatsomething,’ one commenter wrote. Another message read: 'Really don't think your sending your daughter a good message. She probably thinks wow my mom's a lot older than me and can fit my clothes, so I must be really big for my age.' The former reality star tried to make light of the incident via Twitter on Monday and claimed that she had only been trying to make her daughter laugh . Do you see any harm in Bethenny Frankel's photo dressed in her four-year-old daughter's clothes? ‘Starting a complex early for your daughter,’ another commenter added of the pic. Another message read: ‘I would just . caution doing this as she gets more impressionable. She needs to develop . a healthy self-image because she may not have all of your genes…and it . won't be obvious to you, but it will look as though you are competing . with her.’ Frankel took to Twitter on Monday morning to defend herself claiming that she was just joking and trying to please her daughter. The slimline former talk show host, whose divorce from ex Jason Hoppy was finalized earlier this year, has admitted to an unhealthy relationship with food in the past. In 2010, she told Redbook magazine that she 'used to get drunk and binge on everything in the deli, and then do a juice fast or starve, then do it all over again.' Frankel rose to fame via reality TV, first as a contestant on The Apprentice: Martha Stewart and then on The Real Housewives of New York City. 'Starting a complex early for your daughter': Frankel has been accused of setting a bad example for her daughter Bryn Hoppy . On the back of her celebrity she has . written several books, including Naturally Thin: Unleash Your SkinnyGirl . and The SkinnyGirl Dish: Easy Recipes for Your Naturally Thin Life. She . also created the Skinnygirl cocktail company which she then sold for an . estimated $100 million . Her talk show, Bethenny premiered last September but got cancelled in February. Bethenny married Bryn's father businessman Jason Hoppy in March 2010, just two months before their daughter was born in May. But the union lasted less than three years and she filed for divorce from the 43 year-old in January 2013. Since then, the pair have been involved in a bitter custody battle over the little girl. In court in May, twice-married Bethenny gave dramatic testimony as reported by Us Weekly. 'Jason said to me, 'Get ready, we are going to war. It's over. We're done,' she claimed on the stand. 'He would hold Bryn, and he would say, 'You're finished, you're done. I'm going to ruin you.' When they were three: The TV star and her then husband Jason Hoppy pictured in May 2012 with their daughter before they decided to split . Thankfully last month lawyers were able to thrash out a custody arrangement both were happy with. 'My client is delighted that this custody dispute has been resolved; that his co-parenting status has been acknowledged; that the parties' child will have the benefit of being raised by both parents; and most importantly, that his daughter will no longer be at the mercy of a high-profile courtroom battle,' Jason's attorney Bernard Clair told MailOnline. And the mood appears to have lightened between the warring former couple. 'Jason wishes Bethenny only the best of luck, and he looks forward to sharing with her all of the joyous occasions, milestones, and blessings that will be coming up in his daughter's future,' the lawyer added.","The Skinnygirl mogul has been accused by her Instagram followers of sending a bad message to her 4-year-old daughter .

"By . Will Stewart . A horrific road rage attack where a man struck a car carrying two children with an axe has been caught on camera. A middle-aged man and a father in his 30s with his children in the back of his Audi were at first engaged in a shouting match, which turned violent as the first began hitting the car. A girl aged around seven is heard screaming in fear and holding her hands over her eyes. The horrific incident in Russia has led to a major hunt for the middle aged driver who perpetrated the shocking attack. Scroll down for video . Road rage: A man was filmed wielding an axe and striking a car with two children in the back on a highway in St Petersburg . A minor dispute on a highway near a park in St Petersburg led to the appalling altercation, with a hysterical woman begging the angry driver of a black Land Cruiser to calm down before the incident exploded into violence. The dispute began when the driver of an Audi car - a man in his 30s - hooted when the other vehicle stopped abruptly in heavy traffic. The two cars did not bump, but prompted a roadside shouting match. Throughout the woman with the enraged Land Cruiser driver tries to calm him, but he constantly fights off her attempts during the spat on the busy highway. After several minutes of enraged argument with the driver of the Audi - in which two small children were in the back seat - the white shirted owner of the Land Cruiser suddenly went to the back of his vehicle and pulled out a long-handled axe. Attacker: The two drivers had a heated exchange by the side of the road before the driver of a black Land Cruiser grabbed an axe . 'Papa!': Two children sitting in the back of the Audi could be heard screaming in terror for their father . The Land Cruiser driver strikes the bonnet of the Audi and the windshield with the axe . The saloon car driver rushed back into . his car, and began reversing it when the axe man smashed his weapon . onto the bonnet of the car. A second blow hit the windscreen of the Audi manoeuvred his car away. The . children in the car are heard screaming, as is the woman - possibly the . attacker’s wife - as she tried but failed to restrain him. He then aimed another blow at the back seat window where the children were sitting, but failed to strike the car. Amid the anguished screams two children's voices are hearing shouting ‘Papa!’. The axe man struck the Audi three times, fortunately not harming anyone inside the car. As the children scream in the back seat, the Audi driver tries to get away from the axe-wielding attacker by reversing . Terrifying: The woman who had been travelling with the attacker tried in vain to hold him back from striking the Audi once more . By an inch: The man strikes the Audi three times before it gets away, but attempts to follow in on foot . He then chased the Audi on foot but soon gave up, returning clutching his weapon. The Audi driver made away, and was followed by another the driver who had filmed the road rage nightmare but not intervened as the horror unfolded. This third driver offered the Audi driver his footage to show to the police. One scared girl was seen through the back window of the Audi. ‘Brother, I filmed everything, let me give it to you and help,’ he said. Police have launched a hunt for the axe man who is understood to have left the scene after the attack. It is now routine for drivers in Russia to have dashboard cameras to use as evidence in insurance claims, and to lower the risk of being framed by bribe-taking traffic police.","Highway shouting match turned violent outside St Petersburg .

"By . Will Stewart . and Sara Malm . Women are now joining the ranks of the Ukrainian army’s National guard, as it is claimed that dozens of children have been killed . Female recruits could be seen taking the military oath at a National Guard ceremony outside Kiev as some 600 new volunteers joined the ranks. This comes as an MP from the Donetsk region in eastern Ukraine claimed that more than 40 children have been killed in battles in the area - a figure ten times higher than the official toll. All for one: A female recruit of the Ukrainian Army's Donbass battalion takes a military oath during a ceremony of the National Guard unit near the Novi Petrivtsi village not far from Kiev . Tatyana Bahteyeva, a doctor and chairman of Kiev's parliamentary committee on health, warned: ‘More than 40 children have died from shrapnel wounds. ‘That is from shrapnel after explosions in windows next to which children were located. Innocent children have been hit with bullets to their hearts, which brings immediate death.’ An MP from Donetsk region, in the forefront of recent battles, she claimed her shocking figure - disputed by the authorities and not possible to immediately verify - came from her own analysis of local morgue records and information from doctors and hospitals over a ten week period, her office stated. ‘This situation is known by everyone in Donetsk, this is why people are so scared,’ she said, alleging that official figures, which say four children were killed, have masked the true horror of the death toll since Kiev launched its ‘anti terrorist campaign’ against separatists in mid-April. Officially, at least 375 people on both sides have perished in the conflict. Still fighting: The woman took a stand next to around 600 other volunteers, as a Ukraine MP claimed 40 children have been killed by shrapnel in the Donetsk region in the east . Tearful goodbye: A volunteer recruit embraces his girlfriend after the oath of allegiance ceremony outside Kiev . Pledge: The woman takes her oath in front of other new recruits and members of her battalion as family and friends watch on . The pro-Kiev regional administration in Donetsk yesterday denied her claims, but her spokeswoman countered: ‘This information is derived from her own sources, primarily from the morgues and from the doctors.’ A former supporter of ex-president Viktor Yanukovyuch, who currently runs the parliamentary health committee, Bahteyeva alleged the authorities had failed to collate ‘centralised information about the number of deaths’. Russia says tens of thousands of Ukrainians, including 5,300 children, have fled eastern regions into and flooded into its border regions as refugees. UNICEF reported in early June that seven children had been injured in the fighting in the east of Ukraine since May 9. UNICEF noted the crisis is having an increasing impact on children and urged all the parties to stop the violence. On Monday, insurgents in eastern Ukraine say they will honour a ceasefire declared by the Ukrainian president and engage in more talks to help resolve the conflict. Alexander Borodai, one of the rebel leaders who took part in today's talks in Donetsk, said they would respect the ceasefire declared on Friday by Petro Poroshenko. Mr Borodai also promised that the insurgents would release observers from the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe whom they have held.

According to Russian sources, thousands of Ukrainians, including 5,300 children, have fled eastern regions flooded into its border regions as refugees . Meanwhile, . a Moscow MP who is wanted in Britain over the death of dissident secret . serviceman Alexander Litvinenko, has called for Russia to bring back . the KGB. Andrey Lugovoy,  has said he wanted the Russian national security service to be renamed KGB once more. KGB, an acronym for Committee for State Security, was abolished after the USSR collapsed in 1991. USSR memories: Moscow MP Andrey Lugovoy wants to bring back the KGB . ‘I am in support of renaming the Federal Security Service (FSB) into the Committee for State Security,’ said Lugovoy, signalling he would formally propose the move. ‘The KGB was portrayed as a monster that only supported dictatorship in the USSR.’ But, he claimed, it had been necessary to ‘fight’ against dissidents in Soviet times. ‘All the other actions of the organisation focused on state security. ‘Personally, I support the idea of a renaming. We need to think about it.’ The proposal comes amid claims that Vladimir Putin is seeking a return to Soviet-style rule after his land grab for Crimea, restoring it to Kremlin control in the teeth of Western opposition. Lugovoy, 47, an ex-KGB staffer, is wanted by Scotland Yard over the death of Putin enemy Litvinenko in 2006 from radioactive polonium-210 poisoning amid suspicions he had continued links to the FSB, the modern KGB. An MP for the pro-Kremlin Liberal Democrat ultra-nationalist party, he denies the accusation. The Kremlin refuses to extradite him to Britain to face trial for murder. Foreign Secretary William Hague . yesterday warned Putin of new hard-hitting sanctions if he fails to . openly and actively support the Ukrainian president Petro Poroshenko's . plan for peace. ‘By Friday, we will be able to see how Russia is responding,’ he said, stressing time is running out.","Women have been spotted at Ukraine Army initiation ceremony .

"By . Will Stewart . New evidence has emerged of Russian military firepower on the streets of eastern Ukraine in the hands of pro-Moscow separatists, just as the new Ukrainian president has initiated a week long ceasefire. Ukraine's defence minister claimed a . total of ten BM-21 vehicles crossed the border into the hands of . separatists, and said there was definite evidence that they were of . Russian origin. Two T-64 tanks and five armoured personnel carriers were also pictured entering the city of Lugansk close to the Russian border. Ukraine's President Petro Poroshenko announced a week-long unilateral ceasefire would begin Friday in the separatist east to give the pro-Russian rebels a chance to disarm. 'Today, on June 20, the ceasefire should begin. It will last until June 27,' he said on a visit to breakaway Donetsk region, his first since he came to power on June 7. Few observers expect the rebels to lay down their arms in what is supposed to be the first part of his 14 point peace process. Later it was claimed a fierce battle was underway at the city's strategic airport between Ukrainian troops and separatist fighters. The photos have emerged a week after NATO issued a warning to the Kremlin that sending its tanks into Ukraine would mark a 'serious escalation' of the crisis. Scroll down for video . Military vehicles which are thought to be Russian were photographed entering the city of Lugansk . Moscow insists its recent border swelling of troops is to combat weapons smuggled to separatists . The arrival of three tanks, pictured a week ago in separatist hands, caused shock waves since the deployment appeared to contradict Russian assurances to the West that it was seeking to diffuse tension . Defence minister Mykhailo Koval said there was 'operational information that ten BM-21 Grad military vehicle crossed the state border and are on the territory of Ukraine.' One vehicle was seized and destroyed, he said. 'In the vehicle we found evidence that it belonged to the 18th Infantry Brigade from Chechnya, in the Southern Military District of Russia. There were notebooks, map lights and the seals of this brigade,' he said. The US warned that Russia has re-deployed 'significant' military forces near its border with Ukraine and stockpiled additional tanks and artillery at a southwestern site. The equipment and forces were being prepared by Moscow 'to provide active support for separatist fighters,' alleged a senior US administration official. Washington is 'confident' that Moscow last week sent tanks and rocket launchers from the deployment site in southwest Russia into eastern Ukraine where pro-Russian separatists are battling to set up a state that would become part of the Kremlin empire. These photographs appear to show Russian vehicles entering the city of Lugansk in eastern Ukraine . A Kiev military expert warned of a 'stream of mercenaries and weapons from Russia' moving through the border .

Some of the . equipment was of the same type used by Ukrainian forces, an allegation . that follows claims that Russian soldiers have been seen wearing . Ukrainian uniforms. 'Separately we have information that Russia has re-deployed significant military to its border with Ukraine,' said the official. America on Friday unveiled sanctions against seven key separatist leaders in eastern Ukraine. Kiev . military expert Dmitry Tymchuk warned: 'A stream of mercenaries and . weapons from Russia keeps moving through the Dolzhansky border crossing . point into Ukraine. 'Today another convoy of equipment entered in which at least three Grad multiple rocket launchers were identified.' The unmarked arms are Russian in origin, according to Kiev.

"By . Kieran Gill . Christian Atsu first piqued Roberto Martinez's interest when he rose through the ranks at Porto three years ago and the Everton manager says the loan signing will add an extra dimension to his squad. The 22-year-old passed his medical at Goodison on Wednesday evening to become Everton's fifth signing of the summer, and took to Twitter to post a picture of himself and Martinez.

'I do expect a little bit of an adaptation period. He hasn't played in the Premier League and that always requires that period.

"By . Simon Jones . Liverpool's bid to find a replacement striker for Luis Suarez suffered a blow when Loic Remy failed a medical in Boston on Sunday. The £8.5 million move was almost a done deal for the France forward after he'd agreed personal terms and the release clause in his contract was activated, but after medical staff's examination the plug was pulled on the deal. Now the sizeable boots of Suarez remain unfilled, SIMON JONES Jones looks at who else Brendan Rodgers could make a play for ahead of the 2014-15 season. Fallen through: Loic Remy's move to Liverpool fell at the final hurdle after he didn't come through the medical . Big shoes to fill: Now Liverpool is still without a replacement for Barcelona's Luis Suarez . VIDEO Remy deal collapses . Southampton . Value: £16m . Injured and out until October but Liverpool have made their interest known, as have Tottenham. Southampton have also offered a new five-year contract to the 24-year-old but will accept the right offer as they have shown. A January bid makes more sense. In demand: Jay Rodriguez will be recovering from a knee injury until October but is wanted by Liverpool and Tottenham, while Southampton have offered him a five-year contract to stay . Swansea . Value: £21m . Powerful, retains possession well and scores goals. His performance at Anfield last season impressed observers and Liverpool alike but his wage demands and price tag did not when they made recent enquiries for the 25-year-old Ivory Coast striker. Strong option: Wilfried Bony could be a weapon in Anfield's arsenal but money could be a barrier to any move . Real Madrid . Value: £40m . Ready-made superstar striker to fill Suarez's shoes but plays further forward and would put pressure on Daniel Sturridge's role. Wages would be around £200,000 a week and, if the 26-year-old leaves Madrid, he is unsure about Liverpool as a destination. Location, location: Would Karim Benzema be keen to move from Real Madrid to Liverpool? Lyon . Value: £18m . The 23-year-old scored 23 goals last season and provides his fair share of assists. He has attracted attention from Newcastle, in particular. However, if he leaves Lyon he wants Champions League football. Liverpool like him but he does not top their list. Stepping up: Ambitious Lyon forward Alexandre Lacazette (right) wants Champions League football if he moves . Sevilla . Value: £15m . The 27-year-old is admired by Brendan Rodgers but may not be quite the step up in level Liverpool are now looking for. Is pacy and can play wide too. West Ham made recent enquiries - as did Newcastle - for the Frenchman who scored 20 goals last season. Not like for like: Sevilla's Kevin Gameiro is admired by Brendan Rodgers but is hardly a replacement for Suarez .","Remy deal fell through when the striker failed the medical .
