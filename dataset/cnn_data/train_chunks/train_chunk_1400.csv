"British police searching for missing Madeleine McCann spent £16,000 on 67 return flights to Portugal last year, helping the cost of the investigation to soar to nearly £9million. The trips, which cost more than £1,300 per month, came as the Met Police carried out the biggest ever search undertaken by a team of British police overseas, in a bid to find clues about the young girl's disappearance. In June, police flew to the Algarve to carry out forensic searches around Praia da Luz, focusing on scrubland a few hundred metres from the apartment block where Madeleine was last seen alive. Scroll down for video . The search for Madeleine McCann (pictured) has is nearing £9million with £16,000 spent on flights in the past year, new figures show . But, despite an intensive eight-day search operation involving scores of officers carrying out ground excavations, police failed to find any clues. According to figures released under a Freedom of Information act request, officers and staff made 48 return flights in the nine months between January and October. A further 19 were made to the end of December. The cost for the flights was £15,945, an average of £238 per return flight. As well as flights for the search, the trips involved several journeys made by officers to liaise with the Portuguese authorities prior to the excavations. And in December, detectives DCI Nicola Wall and DCI Andy Redwood also travelled to Faro Police Station to question 'key witnesses' in the case. The three days involved overseeing the questioning of four British people and seven Portuguese citizens. During the search, which was said to have been carried out to the ‘highest possible standards’, police combed an area of scrubland equal in size to around nine football pitches. This included checking water pipes, drainage channels and derelict buildings around the Ocean Club resort in Praia da Luz on the Algarve. Police also searched a horseshoe-shaped piece of waste ground that was specifically identified as an area of interest by the latest inquiry. In June, DCI Andy Redwood and other officers flew to the Algarve to oversee excavations of ground around Praia da Luz (pictured) The Home Office said it expected the spend on the investigation between 2014 and 2015, which is currently at £1.2m, to be 'broadly in line with previous years' In total, a Met spokesman said 41 ‘ground anomalies’ – areas where the earth had been disturbed – were discovered by aerial surveys and ground-penetrating radar equipment. These sites, which included three outside the original area, were then painstakingly checked by search teams. But they said no evidence relating to Madeleine McCann had been identified. Scotland Yard abandoned their search of land close to where Madeleine vanished in 2007, but said the multi-million-pound inquiry would continue. The Home Office, which has spent around £2m per year on the investigation since 2011, said this year's spend was likely to be 'broadly in line' with previous years. It means the bill is likely to top £9m. But despite the increased police activity in Portugal, other figures show the number of detectives on the investigation has reduced. At one point there were 29 detectives among 37 staff trying to solve Madeleine's disappearance in Praia da Luz in Portugal. The young girl's parents Kate and Gerry McCann, both 46, from Rothley, Leicester, have fought a tireless campaign to find their missing daughter, regularly appealing to police to keep the investigation active . Now, according to the figures, the number of detectives stands at 21, including 15 constables, three sergeants and two inspectors. There are also nine police support staff and four agency staff - all ex police officers - on the 34-strong team, which is led by Detective Chief Inspector Nicola Wall. Madeleine was just three when she went missing from her family's rented holiday apartment in the resort in May 2007, while her parents ate dinner nearby. There have been no positive sightings. Operation Grange, the special investigation unit into the young girl's disappearance, was set up in 2011 by David Cameron. He set a provisional budget for £5million for the investigation . In its first year, the unit cost close to £2million, with the vast majority of expenses attributed to police officer and staff pay. Between 2012 and 2013, the most expensive leg of the investigation to date, £2.8million was spent on transport, salaries, overtime and premises cost. The following year, through to 2014, the Home Office spent £2.6m. Kate and Gerry McCann, both 46, from Rothley, Leicester, have fought a tireless campaign to find their missing daughter since, regularly appealing to police to keep the investigation into her disappearance active. Portuguese police closed their investigation into her disappearance in 2008 and it took a further three years of campaigning by the McCanns to force the Scotland Yard investigation. Months after the three-year-old vanished, Leicestershire Constabulary was awarded two grants by the Home Office to help fund their efforts. In 2008 they received £525,000 and were awarded a further £221,000 the following year before the case was handed over to Metropolitan Police. In a statement, the Met said any reduction in overall numbers of staff - from 37 to 34 according to the figures - on the investigation was temporary. It said: 'There has been no change to the level of resources allocated to the investigation and any reduction will be the result of natural wastage. Those individuals will be replaced in the near future.'","EXCLUSIVE: Trips last year cost nearly £16,000,  around £1,300 a month .

"The captain of the cruise ship Costa Concordia which sank off the Italian island of Gigilo in 2012 killing 32 people has been sentenced to 16 years in jail for manslaughter. Francesco Schettino, dubbed 'Captain Coward' after he fled the ship before the 4,200 passengers were safely ashore, was handed the sentence this evening in Grosseto, Tuscany. The 54-year-old was given ten years for manslaughter, five for causing a shipwreck, one for abandoning ship, and a further month for giving false information to port authorities. His lawyers had launched a last-minute appeal yesterday attempting to blame the rest of the crew for the accident, but their attempts failed. But despite the guilty verdict today, Schettino remains a free man and still has the right to two legal appeals which can take years to process, meaning he may never see the inside of a cell. Scroll down for video . Francesco Schettino, the captain of the Costa Concordia cruise ship when it crashed off Gigilo Island in 2012 killing 32 people has been sentenced to 16 years in jail . Schettino was dubbed 'Captain Coward' after allegations that he deserted the ship before all 4,200 passengers got off safely, and watched them coming ashore 'without even getting his feet wet' Judges were told that Schettino fled the ship and was discovered by shiver passengers waiting on shore 'without even getting his feet wet'. He tried to argue he fell into a lifeboat by accident . The verdict and sentencing brought an end to a trial that has been running since July 2013. Schettino was commanding the vessel, a floating hotel as long as three football pitches, when it came too close to shore and hit rocks off the Tuscan holiday island of Giglio. He was charged with multiple manslaughter, causing a shipwreck and abandoning ship in one of the highest-profile shipping disasters in recent years. Earlier the court had heard that Schettino was a 'reckless idiot' who had been showing off to a waiter on board the ship, and a friend on Giglio island, when he steered the ship close to the shore on the night of January 13. Witnesses said Schettino had escaped the stricken vessel before all passengers had left, and when the arrived shivering on shore, they saw him standing there 'without even getting his feet wet'. Judges were also told that after the ship hit rocks, causing a tear in its hull which caused it to tip over on one side, the evacuation was delayed chaotic. Some of the ship's lifeboats were not deployed, while few instructions were given by the crew, judges heard. The former captain's lawyers had argued that he delayed the evacuation because of the wind conditions, and did not use some of the lifeboats as they had not taken part in an inspection several months previous. Schettino, pictured yesterday as the guilty verdict is read out, was not at his sentencing today. His lawyers claimed he was suffering from a fever, despite him making an impassioned plea earlier in the day . Passengers flee the Costa Concordia as the ship begins to list on the night of January 13, 2012. Schettino later admitted he was showing off when he sailed the vessel so close to rocks on Giglio Island . They also tried to argue that the captain had fallen into a lifeboat, rather than fleeing, but video from the vessel seemed to show him waiting calmly in line before climbing on board. A panel of three judges found Schettino guilty of manslaughter and sentenced him to 16 years and one month in jail. After seven hours consideration judges emerged through red velvet curtains from backstage at the theatre Moderna. Schettino was not in court for the verdict although earlier in the day he had made an impassioned appeal. His lawyers said he was at his apartment with a fever. He was also ordered to pay court costs and was banned from public office for life. He was banned for five years from being at the command of a ship. Each of the 110 civil plaintiffs, crammed into a theatre where the trial is being held to accommodate them, will receive 30,000 Euros (£23,000) each, while 300,000 Euros (£230,000) will go to the island of Giglio and the region of Tuscany. Cesare Bulgheroni, a lawyer representing a Greek couple who survived and the estate of a German who died, said: 'Something is missing in this trial of Schettino. It is incomplete because, in our view, other responsibilities, beyond his, emerged.' Mr Bulgheroni said an emergency diesel generator didn't work, elevators didn't shut down for safety reasons during the disaster, and some crew didn't speak Italian - the ship's working language - while others barely spoke English. Judges at the court in Grosseto read out Schettino's sentence this evening. However it is far from certain he will see jail, as he is entitled to two legal appeals which could take years to process . The Costa Concordia was travelling close to Gigilo Island when it hit rocks which ripped a whole in its side, causing the vessel to capsize and starting a panicked late-night evacuation . The lawyer joined others in a network called 'Justice for the Concordia', insisting cruise line firm Costa Crociere's board of directors should have been held equally responsible. Mr Bulgheroni added: 'We didn't have those people in the dock. There was only Schettino. People didn't die because the ship hit the rocks, they perished because they weren't helped in the emergency.' The company was fined 1 million euros in 2013 by a judge in Tuscany. Hours before the verdict Schettino's lawyers made a last-ditch attempt to blame the disaster on his own crew - living up to his nickname of Captain Coward. Lawyer Donato Laino told the court in Grosseto that prosecutors had built their case 'around one person, not the facts', and Mr Schettino believed he was being made a scapegoat for wider failings. Schettino's lawyers denied he acted like a 'reckless idiot' when the Concordia smashed into a reef when sailing too close to the Tuscan island of Giglio on July 27, 2014. Investigators severely criticised his handling of the disaster, accusing him of bringing the 290 metre-long vessel too close to shore amid claims he was 'saluting' those on the shore. Schettino's lawyers had attempted a last-minute legal appeal, attempting to blame the rest of the crew for the accident, but it was unsuccessful . The disaster triggered a chaotic night evacuation of more than 4,000 passengers and crew and left 32 people dead. Survivors spoke of their shock of seeing the skipper standing on the shore after the disaster without even getting his feet wet. Prosecutors had asked for a sentence of 26 years in prison for Schettino, who admitted some responsibility as captain of the ship but denied blame for deaths that occurred during the evacuation. Passenger Joe Stribley, 23, a dancer from Maidstone, Kent, said he was ‘happy’ with the outcome. ‘When the ship started to sink, extreme panic set in and I thought I was going to die,’ he added. ‘People started to jump into the water and I did the same and managed to get to the shore. ‘When I got home, I was very withdrawn, in shock and disbelief.’ Another dancer Rosalyn Rincon, 33, from Blackpool, has been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder. ‘It felt like a horrible nightmare,’ she said. ‘I was trying to help other passengers and suddenly realised there were no other lifeboats. It dawned on me I was not going to be rescued – I couldn’t stop shaking. ‘We were told by crew to jump into the water. I was terrified but I knew it was the only way. ‘When I got home, I lost all my confidence and struggled to come to terms with what had happened.’","Francesco Schettino captained Costa Concordia when it crashed in 2012 .

"A Florida-based humane society has been accused of kidnapping Bart the so-called 'Zombie Cat.' Plaintiff Ellis Hutson, Bart's owner, made the allegation against the Humane Society of Tampa Bay in a lawsuit obtained by 7online. Hutson's suit also reportedly accused the Humane Society of Tampa Bay of 'keeping Bart for publicity to raise money for the organization.' Scroll down for video . Zombie cat: In January, a car hit 1½-year-old Bart the cat in Tampa . Farewell: Bart's owner, Ellis Hutson, has said he was so distraught, he couldn't stand the thought of burying Bart, so he asked neighbor to dig a shallow grave . It's alive! Five days later, on January 21, a matted and injured Bart emerged, meowing for food . In January, a car hit 1 ½-year-old Bart the cat in Tampa, the Tampa Bay Times reported at the time. Owner: Ellis Hutson, pictured, is suing to get Bart the cat back from the Humane Society of Tampa Bay . Huston told the newspaper he was so distraught, he couldn't stand the thought of burying Bart, so he asked neighbor to dig a shallow grave. Five days later, on January 21, a matted and injured Bart emerged, meowing for food, according to the Tampa Bay Times. 'At first it blew me away,' Dusty Albritton, the neighbor who buried Bart, told the newspaper. 'All I knew was this cat was dead and ""Pet Sematary"" is real.' Bart suffered a broken jaw, a ruptured eye and a torn-up face, as well as dehydration and hunger, the newspaper reported. Hutson didn't know what to do, according to the Tampa Bay Times. 'It was unbelievable,' he told the newspaper. 'I've never seen anything like that before.' Hutson contacted the Humane Society of Tampa Bay, which through the Save-A-Pet Medical Fund would help cover the costs of Bart's care, according to the newspaper. On January 27, the cat reportedly received surgery to remove an eye, wire his jaw shut and insert a feeding tube. At the time, the agency's executive director Sherry Silk told the Tampa Bay Times that Bart would recover in about six weeks and would be going home with Hutson. 'He's purring, even with all these injuries,' Silk told the newspaper. 'I can't even imagine how awful he must have felt. He's just a really wonderful, patient, loving cat.' Recovery: Bart continues to heal after he 'awoke from the dead' He is seen here in a Feb. 10 photo . Treatment: Late last month, Bart underwent surgery to remove an eye, wire his jaw shut and insert a feeding tube, which cost more than $1,000 . Discovery: Bart suffered a broken jaw, a ruptured eye and a torn-up face. He was reportedly dehydrated and hungry, but alive . However, on January 30 the Humane Society of Tampa Bay said in a statement on its website 'New Information About Bart: Recently we have learned new information about Bart’s home environment and the circumstances leading up to his burial. Therefore, the Humane Society of Tampa Bay does not intend to return Bart to the Hutson family. We are prepared to fight for the best interests of this cat. We hope the Hutson family will do the right thing and surrender Bart to our care so that we can find an appropriate environment for him to live out his life.' At the time, the Humane Society of Tampa Bay said both its Save-a-Pet Medical Fund and donations would cover all of Bart's treatment. Last week, Silk told WFTS 'I don't believe [Hutson] has the ability to take care of this cat.' According to the ABC affiliate, Silk described Hutson's daughter as continually attempting to play with Bart, saying 'She's a typical 2-year-old. We want a home with no young children that could put him in jeopardy.' Silk also told the television station she viewed a YouTube video which shows Bart. 'He might not have been dead,' an off-camera woman says in the clip, 7online noted, going on to say she later that she discovered the cat 'moving and stuff.' Temporary tomb: Bart was buried - but emerged out of the ground just five days later . Attention-grabbing? Hutson's suit also reportedly accused the Humane Society of Tampa Bay of 'keeping Bart for publicity to raise money for the organization' 'If somebody tells you the cat is still breathing and it's alive, the cat shouldn't have been buried,' Silk told WFTS. 'I don't know if it was purposeful, but we are not going to return the cat to him.' Silk also said at the time that the humane society would be willing to go to court. The Humane Society of Tampa Bay told WFTS last week of a phone call it received from an individual who claimed to be planning to 'storm' the hospital and snatch Bart. Hutson, meanwhile, told the television station last week 'If we have to go to court, we have to go to court. I haven't done anything wrong, and I don't think it's right to take my cat.' In a statement sent to Daily Mail Online, the humane society said 'On Tuesday, February 10, 2015, the Humane Society of Tampa Bay was served with official Hillsborough County Court documents notifying the Society that it is being sued by Ellis Wayne Hutson for the custody of Bart the cat. 'Mr. Thomas Gonzalez, of Thompson Sizemore, Gonzalez & Hearing, has agreed to volunteer his time to represent the interests of Sherry Silk, the Humane Society of Tampa Bay, and Bart the cat. The Humane Society of Tampa Bay will review all legal options to keep Bart safe and secure. Bart continues his medical treatment and care at the Society’s animal hospital.'","WARNING: GRAPHIC IMAGES .

"President Barack Obama said in an interview on Tuesday that he ahs had to tell families of dead American hostages like 26-year-old Kayla Mueller that the United States will not pay to ransom their loved one, and it's 'as tough as anything I do.' But the Obama administration's handling of the Bowe Bergdahl saga – attempting, according to a member of Congress, to pay an intermediary for his safe return and then trading five high-value Taliban terrorists for him when that failed – suggests the White House's policy is less than consistent. Obama told Buzzfeed that 'as a general rule, what we don’t want to do is make other American citizens riper targets' for groups like the ISIS terror army by handing over millions of dollars for hostages. 'We devoted enormous resources, and always devote enormous resources, to freeing captives or hostages anywhere in the world,' Obama said, 'and I deployed an entire operation at significant risk to rescue not only [Mueller], but the other individuals that had been held and probably missed them by a day or two.' President Obama told Buzzfeed in his latest unconventional media interview that America still won't pay to ransom hostages, but his handling of the Bowe Bergdahl saga raises questions about how the situation of Kayla Mueller's capture was handled . Kayla Mueller, 26, an American humanitarian worker from Prescott, Arizona, died – according to ISIS – when a Jordanian airstrike leveled a buildign in Syria . Terri Crippes (left) and Lori Lyon (right), the aunts of Kayla Mueller, grieved on Tuesday after the 26-year-old's death was confirmed – although the circumstances in which she perished remain unclear . Obama launched a similar rescue mission to go after Bergdahl, a U.S. Army soldier who walked away from his post in 2009. But unlike in the Mueller case, the administration also tried to make what a California congressman characterized as a random delivery to free Bergdahl, who will likely be charged with desertion when the results of a Pentagon investigation are made public. Rep. Duncan Hunter said in November that the Defense Department attempted to pay the terrorist Haqqani network in Pakistan, which was holding Bergdahl, but was duped by a con man who ran off with the money. The Pentagon said on June 9, 2014 that 'there was no money exchanged for Bergdahl’s release.' The White House's National Security Council insisted a day later that 'the United States did not provide money in exchange for Sgt. Bergdahl’s release.' Those carefully parsed statements, however, allow for the possibility that Duncan is right: money was sent but never reached its intended recipient. Hunter press secretary Joe Kasper told Daily Mail Online in November that the Haqqanis 'wanted to deal. They were desperate to deal.' The administration 'can deny it all they want,' he said. He added that the federal government has long included ransom plans among possible outcomes during hostage crises, using third-party 'cutouts' to maintain deniability. 'We don't pay a ransom in the sense that the U.S. government officially makes payments to a foreign entity,' Kasper said, emphasizing the word 'officially.' 'The way we've been doing this for a long time is through a workaround.' California Republican Rep. Duncan Hunter told the Defense Secretary in November that he had learned of an attempt to ransom Bowe Bergdahl through a middle-man . Bergdahl (right) was captured by Taliban fighters shortly after he abandoned his post in 2009 . The Obama administration secured Bergdahl's safe return by releasing five Taliban leaders from the Guantanamo Bay, Cuba military detention camp . Hunter wrote in a November 5, 2014 letter to then-Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel 'that a payment was made to an Afghan intermediary who ""disappeared"" with the money and failed to facilitate Bergdahl's release in return. The payment was made in January-February 2014.' 'I recognize the reluctance to describe a payment as a ransom,' the Congressman added, whiel claiming that the botched payment was indeed made 'regardless of how the transaction is described.' Obama's sit-down with Buzzfeed is the latest in a series of occasions where the White House has given liberals in nontraditional media outlets rare access to the leader of the free world. Last month three YouTube celebrities interviewed Obama, including one comedienne best known for eating Fruit Loops while sitting in a bathtub filled with milk and the cereal. The folllowing day the president spoke with Vox, a newish left-wing website known for 'Voxsplaining' news concepts – and attracting digital slaps from people eager to correct its mistakes. Buzzfeed's interview covered other topics related to Russia, the 2016 elections, and companies' reactions to restrictions placed on them by the Affordable Care Act. GRIEF: Isabella Nalda, bottom, and her mother, Eileen, placed flowers at a makeshift memorial for Kayla Mueller on Tuesday in Prescott, Arizona . ISIS claimed the rubble of this house was where Mueller died following a Jordanian airstrike, but that has not been confirmed . The president also tried to square his vaccilating postions on gay marriage through the years, claiming that he always supported the idea although his opinion clashed during the 2008 elections 'with what were a whole bunch of religious sensitivities out there.' In the aftermath of the Mueller murder at ISIS's hands, Obama cautioned that paying ransoms would mean 'not only are we financing their slaughter of innocent people and strengthening their organization, but we’re actually making Americans even greater targets for future kidnappings.' After the 5-for-1 Bergdahl swap, a Taliban commander in Afghanistan told Time magazine that Americans can expect to see more kidnappings as terrorists seek to free more of their leaders from U.S. custody. 'It's better to kidnap one person like Bergdahl than kidnapping hundreds of useless people,' the commander said. 'It has encouraged our people. Now everybody will work hard to capture such an important bird.'","The president said Tuesday that the US continues to refuse to pay ransom for hostages held overseas .

"Apple will spend nearly $850million on a solar energy project that will generate enough power for the computer giant's new corporate headquarters, retail stores and other operations in California. The tech company will be the biggest single consumer of energy from the new solar facility, which is being constructed on 2,900 acres in rural Monterey County, south of the San Francisco Bay Area where Apple is headquartered. The project reflects Apple's concern about climate change, CEO Tim Cook said at a Goldman Sachs investment conference Tuesday in San Francisco.

"Former New England Patriots star Aaron Hernandez's fiancée has been granted the immunity sought by prosecutors in his murder trial. The decision released by a judge Tuesday means that Shayanna Jenkins, 25, could be compelled to testify or face time prison time. Lawyers prosecuting Hernandez, 25, for the 2013 murder of Odin Lloyd, 27, filed the petition for immunity last month. Shayanna Jenkins, 25, has been granted immunity in the trial of her fiancée, meaning that evidence she provides cannot lead to her prosecution . Aaron Hernandez, a former star for the NFL's New England Patriots, is charged with the murder of semi-professional football player Odin Lloyd . Bristol County, Massachusetts, Superior Court Judge Susan Garsh held a closed hearing at that time, but did not immediately release a decision. All details of the petition were sealed at the time it was filed. The court said it was because the petition contains grand jury testimony. It wasn't clear when or if Jenkins would be called to testify. The grant of immunity may mean that the football player's girlfriend will not be able to invoke her Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination if she takes the witness stand. Prosecutors have said Jenkins lied to a grand jury dozens of times including when she said she didn't know what she did with a box she took from the basement of their home. They say it contained possible evidence leading to Mr Lloyd's killer. Jenkins has pleaded not guilty to perjury. Evidence she gives in Hernandez's case could not be used to prove she lived to the grand jury under the immunity. Judge Susan Garsh held a closed hearing about the granting of immunity to Shayanna Jenkins, an a petition for the measure was sealed because it contained grand jury testimony . Odin Lloyd, (left) 27, was found with multiple gunshot wounds at an industrial park near Hernandez's home. His girlfriend Shaneah Jenkins, (right) 23, testified against the NFL star in court . Her testimony may be pivotal in the case for Hernandez, alleged accomplice Carlos Ortiz and alleged accomplice Ernest Wallace. Hernandez also allegedly asked his girlfriend to hide or destroy the .45 Glock that prosecutors suspect he used to shoot Mr Lloyd, according to Sports Illustrated. Surveillance shows Jenkins carrying a black garbage bag out of her and Hernandez's house shortly after the victim was killed. The gun used to kill Mr Lloyd has never been found. Mr Lloyd, who played semi-professional football, was dating Jenkins' sister Shaneah, 23, at the time his body was found shot in an industrial park near Hernandez's home. Shayanna Jenkins has been seen often in court during the trial, sitting behind Hernandez to support him. The two, who were sweethearts at Bristol Central High School in Connecticut, have been heard whispering 'I love you' to each other and occasionally joking together. Jenkins last week also shared notes with Hernandez's defense team after her sister testified against the athlete. The linebacker's fiancée still lives in the couple's North Attleborough mansion with their 2-year-old daughter. Hernandez's trial is expected to resume Wednesday after a two-day snowstorm delay.","Evidence from Shayanna Jenkins, 25, cannot be used in her perjury trial .

"John Dehlin, 45, has been booted from the Mormon church after refusing to shutdown  a website that  offers doubting members a forum to chat . A Mormon man  has been kicked out of the religion after refusing to shut down a popular website that offers doubting church members a forum to chat. John Dehlin, who has run Mormonstories.org for a decade, was unanimously excommunicated by regional church members on Tuesday for 'apostasy,' which is defined as repeatedly opposing the faith in a public manner. The father-of-four has publicly stated his belief that the Book of Mormon and Book of Abraham are fraudulent and has rejected the Mormon religion as being the 'true church with power and authority for God.' He has also discussed the church's unflattering history, including its polygamous past under founder Joseph Smith - who had a teen bride and married other men's wives. Dehlin said he was told last year that his well-known support for same-sex marriage was also one of the reasons he was being accused of apostasy, although a spokesman for the church disputed his claims. The popular podcaster received a letter informing him of his excommunication, considered the harshest punishment available for a church member. Dehlin, 45, has been a member of the church since birth. The letter, which came from regional church leader Bryan King, said Dehlin is being kicked out  not because he doubted and asked questions about church doctrine, but because he made categorical statements opposing the faith that were disseminated on his website. King said that Dehlin's actions have led others to leave the faith, citing his claims that the sacred texts of the Latter Day Saints were fraudulent and his rejection of the Mormon church as the sole religion with authority from God. 'You do not have the right to remain a member of the church in good standing while openly and publicly trying to convince others that church teachings are in error,' he wrote. The decision came two days after Dehlin, who lives in North Logan, Utah, met with church leaders for a four-hour disciplinary hearing. Dehlin told church leaders he hoped he wouldn't be excommunicated but could not in good conscience stop operating his website. 'We're going to keep telling stories and keep providing support and community for Mormons who are unorthodox,' he said in a statement following his removal on Tuesday. Dehlin and his wife Margi speak to their supporters. Dehlin was unanimously excommunicated by regional church members for 'apostasy,' defined as repeatedly opposing the faith in a public manner . Dehlin is the second high-profile church member to be kicked out in the past year. Kate Kelly, founder of a group pushing for women to be allowed in the religion's lay clergy, was removed from the religion last June. Scholars say Kelly and Dehlin are the most high-profile examples of excommunication proceedings since 1993. That year, the church disciplined six Mormon writers who questioned church doctrine. Dehlin supporter and active Mormon Mike Huband said the church was sending a message with Dehlin and Kelly's removals. 'Don't express your doubts or concerns publicly, or you risk excommunication. They are saying to those people on the fringes, ""We don't want you in the church.""' 'It's very disappointing.' Huband said Dehlin helped him navigate a recent faith crisis and figure out a way to focus on the positives of Mormonism and stay in the religion. To supporters like Huband, Dehlin is a hero who risked his standing in the faith to create a much-needed forum where church members could openly discuss sensitive or controversial issues about the faith. About 200 supporters held a weekend vigil for Dehlin outside the church building where his disciplinary hearing took place. Excommunication is considered the harshest punishment available for a church member . About 200 supporters held a weekend vigil for Dehlin outside the church building where his disciplinary hearing took place. To his detractors, Dehlin is a Latter-day Saint who long ago stopped believing in the faith's core tenets and has painted himself as a martyr. Scott Gordon, co-founder of pro-Latter Day Saints organization MormonVoices, said Dehlin's excommunication was necessary to protect people in the religion. 'Dehlin's choices forced his local leaders to take steps to protect their adherents from one who not only ceased to believe, but who actively sought to have others embrace his disbelief,' he said. Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints spokesman Eric Hawkins said people who are kicked out of the church are welcome to return 'through the grace and Atonement of Jesus Christ'. He called excommunication the 'beginning of the road back to full fellowship'. As for Dehlin, he and his family haven't been attending church services since June. He said they do not plan to return and are 'happy to use our Sundays to bond together as a family'. Dehlin, who has faced church discipline multiple times over the past decade, said he has no regrets for trying to help fellow church members deal with their doubts. Regional church leaders said Dehlin's actions have led others to leave the faith, citing his claims that the Books of Mormon and Abraham were fraudulent and his rejection that the Mormon church was the 'true church with power and authority for God'","Father-of-four John Dehlin, 45, runs the website Mormonstories.org .

"Ashley Mullins, 19, is earning £2,000 per week after completing a two-year plumbing apprenticeship . Britain is in desperate need of plumbers, engineers and builders as it faces its biggest skills shortage for 30 years. Major companies and unions have warned that talent gaps across the sector - which many claim have been caused by a continuing decline in apprenticeships - are threatening the economy, just as it is starting to recover from the recession. But the scarcity of skills means those who are willing to plug the gap are getting heavily rewarded for their work - with those in their teens earning up to £100,000 per year. Ashley Mullins, 19, who has just completed a two-year plumbing apprenticeship at Pimlico Plumbers, said he is already earning up to £2,000 a week, as his peers rack up student debts at university. He told MailOnline: 'I think it is brilliant that I have got this skill under my belt and the apprenticeship was the best way to do it - learning on the job and getting paid at the same time. 'I really want to travel the world and having this trade means I can go to every country that I want to work - and it means I can save up easily, too.' According to figures, the construction industry - which accounts for around 7 per cent of GDP - has been particularly hard hit by the shortfall of tradesmen and women, especially in London. Mark Cahill, managing director of recruitment consultant Manpower Group UK, said that one in three of the largest construction companies is having to turn down work on big projects due to a shortage of skilled labour. Last year, Manpower said that foreign bricklayers were being hired to work for £1,000 a week - double the normal amount paid to bricklayers - due to the lack of UK talent. The Union of Construction, Allied Trades and Technology blamed the situation on a 30-year failure to train apprentices. Steve Murphy, general secretary of UCATT, said: 'Skills shortages are a direct result of the industry failing to invest in the future. The entire mind-set of the construction industry is focused on maximising short-term profits.' The union said that the number of construction apprentices being recruited has been falling for decades, even during the boom years before the 2008 recession. Abbie Hutty, 27 (pictured left and right) was inspired to get into engineering after seeing the Beagle II mission to Mars on the news. She was awarded the title of 2013 young female engineer of the year . It added that, in 2013, just 7,280 construction apprentices completed their training across all trades, despite training body Construction Skills estimating that the industry needs 44,690 new entrants to maintain the industry. And it warned the figure would grow as the construction industry continues to recovers from recession. Mr Murphy added: 'The construction industry goes to great lengths not to employ workers directly and in that environment it is unsurprising that companies are not prepared to invest in apprentices, the workers of the future.' The Construction Industry Training Board (CITB) said 400,000 workers left the industry during the downturn and that 100,000 have returned. It estimates that up to 100,000 more could return . Director of Policy and Strategic Planning, Steve Radley, said: 'Construction is experiencing a major comeback – with a sustained period of growth set to make a positive impact on the wider economy. 'To help industry plan ahead, we need a clear commitment from all political parties in the run up to the General Election that infrastructure projects will be delivered.' Meanwhile, in a report published in October last year, the Royal Academy of Engineering said the UK needed to train 75,000 professional engineers every year until 2020. It estimates the current figure as 22,000. Philip Greenish CBE, chief executive of the Royal Academy of Engineering said: 'We must ensure that we are training the right number of engineers. 'Only significant investment in higher education will unlock the engineering talent that the UK economy needs to succeed.' Abbie Hutty, 27, was inspired to get into engineering after seeing a package on the news about the Beagle II mission to Mars. A teacher had already mentioned to her about a possible career in engineering and, when she heard how important British engineers and scientists had been in the mission, she was interested. She is now working on the ExoMars Rover mission, Europe’s first rover mission to the red planet, having studied mechanical engineering at the University of Surrey. She was also awarded the title of 2013 young female engineer of the year by the Institution of Engineering and Technology. She put the lack of people studying engineering down to people not knowing what it is. The construction industry is said to need 44,690 entrants per year, but the figure in 2013 was just 7,000 (file picture) 'As far as most people are concerned, engineers get called out to fix vending machines,' she told the Guardian. She added that teachers needs to spread the word: 'I had a very good physics teacher and she recommended I look at engineering as a career. I knew nothing about it at first. But she was right.' In September last year, Pimlico Plumbers embarked on a national recruitment drive to overcome the skills shortage in London. Traditionally, Pimlico's professional tradespeople are recruited from London and the South East, but the number of quality applications from the region has rapidly decreased as the availability of skilled and experienced engineers has reduced. The company, which currently employs more than 170 staff, is aiming to recruit another 100 experienced professional plumbers and heating engineers from across the UK, who are willing to relocate to London. Major building companies are apparently having to turn down work due to lack of staff (file picture) Charlie Mullins, CEO of Pimlico Plumbers, said: 'The growth in the economy and the returning spending confidence of businesses and consumers has seen demand for our services sore. 'However, the availability of skilled engineers is heading in the opposite direction.' He added that they had brought in 'some great people' in the past 12 months, but there was not enough to meet demand, despite employees being able to earn up to £100,000 a year. He added: 'The short answer is the pool of available talent is shrinking by the day, as the work out there continues to rise, both in terms of our bookings and the work that's around generally.' Former apprentice Ashley Mullins, from Beckenham, south east London, started his apprenticeship with Pimlico Plumbers when he left school, aged 16. With his grandfather as the founder of the company, he had grown up always wanting to get into the plumbing industry. He told MailOnline: 'I'd always been interested in plumbing, ever since I was little. When I was about 15, I started thinking about my future and realised that trade was the best thing to have under my belt.' Ashley said that, at school, pupils were hardly told about apprenticeships, instead being encouraged to go to university or get a job straight away. He said: 'I obviously knew about it because of my family, but because they did not talk much about apprenticeships, I told some of my friends about it and three others ending up getting one as well, when they wouldn't have known otherwise.' Despite starting his training on £30 a day, Ashley has now completed his plumbing training and earns up to £2,000 a week working on his own. Apprentices at Pimlico attend college for one day a week to learn the theory and the rest of the week are supervised by a senior engineer. He said: 'Learning on the job from the start, I was always one step ahead of my classmates at college.' UCATT said a major step forward in increasing apprentice numbers would be the introduction of strict public procurement rules requiring companies to recruit and train apprentices. Companies that failed to train adequate numbers of apprentices would be barred from bidding for public contracts, it suggested. And Maria Seabright, finance and HR director of Greendale Construction, urged schools to promote careers in construction, rather than just A-levels and university. She said: 'The construction industry now offers career opportunities across all academic and skill levels, as well as the ability to work your way up gaining experience as you go.'","Trade unions warn gap has been caused by a decline in apprenticeships .

"Fifty Shades of Grey will be shown in French cinemas to children as young as 12, after the country's film board gave it the second lowest possible age rating. The film was recently named the most erotic mainstream movie in a decade, after featuring more sex on screen than the 100 raunchiest films released in 2014 put together. The president of France's Board of Film Classification defended the low rating, saying Fifty Shades a 'schmaltzy romance' and 'not a film that can shock a lot of people'. 'Schmaltzy': France's Board of Film Classification has given Fifty Shades of Grey a '12' rating . The country's motion picture rating system has four grades - U, 12, 16 and 18, meaning that Fifty Shades has been given the second lowest certificate. France is known to rate films with sexual content lower than many other countries, including the U.S. and the UK. Films rated 'U' in France  include American Beauty, where Kevin Spacey's character has an affair with his teenage daughter's best friend, and Eyes Wide Shut, which features a famous sex scene between Nicole Kidman and Tom Cruise - both rated 18 in the UK. Jean-Francois Mary, president of France's Board of Film Classification, deemed that Fifty Shades of Grey 'isn't a film that can shock a lot of people.' Mr Mary considers the film, that contains scenes of nudity and sadomasochism between an entrepreneur and a virginal student, 'a romance, you could even say schmaltzy.' Kids allowed: Even though Fifty Shades of Grey centers around the relationship between a young female student and a BDSM-obsessed man, the president of France's Board of Film Classification said it is 'not a film that can shock a lot of people' Kids allowed: Children as young as 12 will be able to see the film, starring Jamie Dornan and Dakota Johnson, which features a dozen sex scenes, making up a fifth of its entire running time . The '12' rating follows accusations by several American and British reviewers that the film is too tame. In a barrage of reviews published on Tuesday night, most of those who sat down with the raunchy adaptation ahead of its 13 February release date lamented its 'run-of-the-mill' lovemaking. One critic pointed out that sex only makes up 15 minutes of the two-hour runtime. Another pointed out that there are no visible genitals, no orgasms - and not that much nudity. Fifty Shades, which stars Dakota Johnson as Anastasia Steele and Jamie Dornan as the BDSM-loving Christian Grey, features a dozen sex scenes. The 'raunchiest of the decade' accolade was awarded the film after website Mr Skin, which ranks films by amount of sex scenes, released data seen by the Sunday Times. However, the film's director, Sam Taylor-Johnson, has said that although the film is true to E L James's best-selling book, it may not be as explicit as people might be hoping for. 'The thing that was most difficult was how and where to pepper the sex, and to not make it feel like it was gratuitous,' she said. Defence: Jamie Dornan, pictured arriving in  Berlin, Germany, today has said he would not call film 'erotic' 'So it had to be a really strong part of the story, and I had to give characterisation to each sex scene, to make them different. 'I didn't want it to be graphically explicit, and I know that's going to be disappointing to some people,' Mrs Taylor-Johnson added in an interview with The Guardian newspaper: . 'It's the build up and titillation of touch and sensuality. So I don't think it goes into the realm of porn.' Mrs Taylor-Johnson's opinion has been backed up by the film's leading man, who said he does not consider Fifty Shades an erotic film. 'I just wouldn't use the word ""erotic"" - it brings up different ideas for me. I just think we tried to make a good picture, you know?,' he told the Sunday Times. Fifty Shades of Grey has been rated R in the U.S. for its 'graphic nudity' and 'unusual behavior', and is rated 18 in the UK. Last week it was reported that the film had been banned from being shown in cinemas in Malaysia, where it was deemed 'too sadistic.' The series of three Grey books written by James, 51, from London, has reportedly sold over 100 million copies worldwide and has been translated into 52 languages.","Fifty Shades of Grey given the second lowest age rating in France .

"There were fears on Wednesday that up to 100 children at a Surry Hills child care centre may have been exposed to tuberculosis after a worker tested positive. The identity of the centre has been reported in some circles as the Only About Children facility, authorities conceding the children were exposed to the adult on a regular basis.

Up to 92 kids from 78 families and 15 staff will have to be screened after they were potentially exposed to tuberculosis from an infected worker at the centre. 'Unlike other bacterial infections, TB is not readily spread from child to child and any spread is usually only after prolonged exposure,' Dr Sheppeard added. A small number of infected persons may not show any signs of the disease, but general symptoms include fever, chills, night sweats, loss of appetite, weight loss and fatigue and in some cases, it can be fatal.

"A couple were threatened with eviction from their home of 42 years for feeding birds in their garden. Eric Goleby, 74, and his wife Sally, 66, have left mixed corn outside their bungalow in Hickling, Norfolk, for the four decades they have lived there. But Victory Housing Trust, which owns and manages the social housing, ordered them to stop because of damage allegedly caused to local vehicles by birds. Threatened: Eric Goleby has left mixed corn outside his bungalow for the four decades he has lived there . Order: Victory Housing Trust, which owns and manages the social housing, told Mr Goleby and his wife to stop feeding birds outside their bungalow in Hickling, Norfolk, because of damage caused to local vehicles . Mr Goleby was warned in a chilling letter headlined ‘anti-social behaviour case’ that if they continue to feed wildlife they could face legal action, prosecution or even be evicted. The resident, who cares for his disabled wife Sally around the clock, branded the letter that they received ‘threatening’ and ‘crazy’. He said: ‘After living in Hickling all my life this really hurts. Feeding the birds as we do is not anti-social - far from it. It’s a real privilege to be able to see the birds come here to feed. The retired factory worker added: ‘Our lives would be bare without the birds. We have always fed them throughout the years because we love wildlife.’ Threatening letter: Victory said the complaint had been investigated and the case had since been closed . 'We have always fed the birds': Mr Goleby branded the letter that he and his wife received last month 'crazy' A Victory spokesman said the complaint from a neighbour was investigated and a staff member visited Mr Goleby after he got in touch. The case was later closed because no issues were found. Dear Mr Goleby, . 'Anti-Social Behaviour Case' I regret to inform you that Victory Housing has received complaints of anti-social behaviour from your premises caused either by you, your family, your pets or visitors. As you will be aware from your Tenancy Agreement you are responsible for the actions of all of these people when they are at your home or coming to and from it. The complaints received relate to food waste being thrown into your garden and neighbouring gardens. This behaviour is attracting birds which are causing damage to vehicles in the area. If the problems persist or get worse then we will advise you of this and may well consider legal action alongside our partner agencies. Legal action can ultimately lead to the seizure of equipment, prosecution or the demotion or loss of your tenancy. I would ask that you contact me on the above number as a matter of urgency to discuss this matter. When you call please quote the above reference number to ensure your message reaches me promptly. Yours sincerely, . Charlotte Mcknespiey . ASB Officer . He said the resident should have no fear when feeding the birds, and that the tone of letters sent to tenants will now be reviewed by the housing organisation following the case. The letter accused Mr Goleby of throwing food waste into his garden and those of neighbours. But the pensioner insisted he buys the feed from a pet shop in nearby Stalham and puts it on the bird table and bird feeders, attracting species ranging from pigeons, to jackdaws, starlings to pheasants. The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds says that feeding garden birds is key to their survival during winter when food is scarce. Charlotte McKnespiey, anti-social behaviour officer at Victory, wrote to Mr Goleby: ‘The complaints received relate to food waste being thrown into your garden and neighbouring gardens.

However, U.N. officials who run the camp say it has begun to emerge from the 'dark period' of violence, as its traumatised residents begin to . reconcile themselves to a lengthy stay. Some of those based at the camp - which is about 8 miles from the Syrian border -  expressed their frustration to the U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry on Thursday when he visited Zaatari. Six refugees met Mr Kerry and angrily told him that the U.S should set up a no-fly zone and safe havens in Syria to protect their fellow citizens.

Hard: The camp has experienced a number of dark days, with riots sometimes breaking out as traumatised residents attempt to get used to their new home . Mr Kerry told them Washington was considering options, including buffer zones for their protection, but that the situation was complex and appeared to hint at war fatigue in the United States after years of fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan. 'Where is the international community? What are you waiting for?' a Syrian woman, who did not give her name, told Kerry. At least impose a no-fly zone or an embargo. 'The U.S., as a superpower, can change the equation in Syria in 30 minutes after you return to Washington.' Waving a pen in the air and tapping it on the table, the woman referred to the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan, which ends in three weeks. She said: 'Mr. Secretary, if the situation remains unchanged until the end of Ramadan this camp will become empty. We will return to Syria and we will fight with knives.'

Temporary: The Zaatari camp is about 8 miles from the Syrian border . 'You, as the U.S. government look to Israel with respect. Cannot you do the same with the children of Syria?' Mr Kerry took a helicopter tour of the tents and pre-fabricated, container-like homes that form by far the biggest camp for Syrians in Jordan. Meeting refugees afterwards in a fenced-off administrative section, he acknowledged the anger. 'They are frustrated and angry at the world for not stepping in and helping,' he told reporters. 'I explained to them I don't think it's as cut and dry and as simple as some of them look at it. But if I were in their shoes I would be looking for help from wherever I could find it.' More than 1.7 million Syrian refugees have fled to nearby countries to escape fighting that began as protests against the government in March 2011 and has degenerated into civil war with an increasingly sectarian dimension. Jordan has been host to big U.N. camps for Palestinian refugees for more than six decades. An administrator at Zaatari was asked by reporters how long his camp would remain open for Syrians.

Ensaf Haidar, who is living in exile in Canada with the couple's three young children, is 'very hopeful' her husband may be released now Saudia Arabia has a new king, Salman. Prince Charles' intervention on Raif's behalf is particularly welcome, as a monarch speaking to a monarch. Yesterday, the MailOnline reported sources had confirmed Prince Charles had discreetly tackled the subject with Saudi's new king during a 20 minute chat. Scroll down for video . Raif Badawi (pictured) was sentenced to 1,000 lashes and 10 years behind bars for 'insulting Islam' through his human rights blog, Saudi Liberal Network . The case has sparked international outrage - and yesterday Prince Charles even stepped in, with sources saying he had spoken to the new Saudi king Salman (both pictured, above) about the case . 'I am hopeful the new king will show clemency on my husband,' she said. 'As for Prince Charles' support, it is very welcome, as is every sign of support from all over the world. 'The fact that he himself is from a monarchy is important.' But Ensaf has warned her husband, who has not been flogged 'for medical reasons' since the first 50 lashes, is struggling. 'Raif is not doing very well, either physically or psychologically,' she revealed. 'The children are also very worried and are not very well ever since they found out about the flogging.' But Ensaf herself is very hopeful: the change in ruler could mean her husband's sentence of 10 years behind bars and 1,000 lashes is reduced, or even dismissed entirely. But Raif's wife Ensaf (pictured left) has warned her husband is not doing well 'either physically or psychologically', and the couple's children (pictured right with Raif) are also terribly worried . Raif was handed the punishment for supposedly insulting religious figures and undermining the regime - a charge he and his wife Ensaf Haidar strenuously deny. In fact, he had been writing a blog on human rights. He is being flogged 50 times every Friday for supposedly insulting religious figures and undermining the regime - a charge he and his wife Ensaf Haidar strenuously deny. The first 50 of the lashes were inflicted in front of hundreds in the main square in Jeddah in January - and the same was due to happen again for the next 19 weeks. But so far, it has not come to pass: pressure from the international community appears to have halted the Saudi authorities in their steps. What's more, at the beginning of this month, Suad al-Shammari - the co-founder of Raif's blog, Saudi Liberal Network - was released after 90 days in prison in Jeddah.","Ensaf Haidar has welcomed Prince Charles intervention this week .

"Being Australia's oldest person hasn't slowed down Alfie Date, who launched a knitting mission just twelve hours after arriving at his new retirement home to provide jumpers for penguins in need. Alfred 'Alfie' Date is 109 years old, and began knitting in 1932 when his sister-in-law taught him how to knit a jumper for his newborn nephew. Now, Alfie is putting his generous and still-nimble fingers to good use, creating tiny clothes for Phillip Island Penguins who needed woolen jumpers in the wake of an oil spill which prevented the creatures from staying dry, 9Stories reported. Scroll down for video . Alfie Date is Australia's oldest man at 109-years-old, and spends his spare time knitting jumpers for penguins . Phillip Island's Penguin Foundation put out a call for keen knitters to create the little jumpers in March last year, to help prevent penguins from swallowing the oil when they attempted to clean themselves. The same day that Alfie arrived at his new aged-care village in Umina, on the Central Coast of NSW, he decided to offer up the skills he had polished over more than 80 years. 'I think I'd been in here about 12 hours, might have been 13. The two girls (nurses) come in to me and say ""We believe you can knit"", Alfie sai. The 109-year-old quickly went to work, joining in hundreds of people around the world who answered the plea for jumpers. He began creating stitch jerseys for the tiny penguins who can be poisoned by oil spills. Little penguins are only found in New Zealand and southern Australia, and there is a colony of 32,000 who live on Phillip Island. Phillip Island's Penguin Foundation put out a call for keen knitters to create the little jumpers in March last year . The 109-year-old quickly went to work, creating stitch jerseys for the tiny penguins affected by the oil spill . The grease allows water to seep under their feather coats, and also causes a great amount of discomfort and distress for the tiny creatures. Despite his age, Alfie said that he always makes sure his jumpers are up to scratch. 'I like to make it without mistakes and I don't excuse myself for doing it. (But) I think there is an excuse for a person who's gone beyond the normal span of life,' he said. Alfie is used to helping others with his talent, and often gets roped into projects for friends and family. 'The girls who used to work for me, they'll tell you I'm a sucker. I can't say no. It's a good way of getting along in life. You make friends all the time but you don't make a fool of yourself either,' Alfie said.

The knitted jumpers help prevent penguins from swallowing the oil when they attempted to clean themselves . Alfie's nephew is now a grandfather himself, and the 109-year-old is now the proud grandfather of 20, and great-grandfather of 'roughly the same', although he suspects he might have more. The Phillip Island Penguin Foundation officially labelled Alfie their 'most senior little penguin jumper knitter', but wasn't aware when he started contributing that he was also the oldest person in Australia. Danene Jones, spokesperson for the Foundation, said that they were privileged to have Alfie aiding their efforts. With the contributions sent in from around the world, the Foundation has received enough jumpers for the penguins, and said that the response had been overwhelming.

"A Spanish warship has been confronted by the Royal Navy near Gibraltar amid growing tensions around the UK outpost. The armed patrol vessel, which typically carries special forces and marines, was spotted cruising irregularly and warned repeatedly to leave British waters. Last night, the Foreign Office lodged a diplomatic protest with Madrid over the most serious episode of sabre-rattling off the Rock in half a century. Rattling the sabre: The Spanish warship Tornado, pictured, entered British waters near Gibraltar for 20 minutes where it was confronted by the Navy and asked to leave (file image) There are fears that the Spanish government is seeking to ramp up tensions to deflect attention away from domestic problems threatening to engulf Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy. Prominent Gibraltar barrister Charles Gomez said: 'There has not been an incursion such as this since the mid-1960s when General Franco ruled Spain. 'The current situation is very similar to that recently involving the Falkland Islands where an unpopular government in Argentina has seen a territorial dispute as the best way to bury bad news at home. 'However, the major difference is that Spain is supposed to be an ally within NATO and a partner in the European Union. William Dartmouth, UKIP MEP for the South West and Gibraltar, urged the Government to draw a line in the sand following the latest incursion . 'Gibraltar remains staunchly British and loyal but the worry among many people here is that unless London becomes more active in protecting its interests, matters will soon escalate into an armed incident. 'All vessels have the right to innocent passage across British waters but they cannot stop without good reason and they cannot patrol the waters as if they belong to them.” The warship Tornado is a 94-metre-long vessel which dwarfs both the Royal Navy’s light craft based at Gibraltar. In last Saturday’s incident, she spent 20 minutes in British waters and was sent repeated radio warnings to leave immediately. Locals are furious at a string of recent minor incursions featuring Spanish police motor boats interfering with pleasure craft and protecting fishermen using illegal practices. The incidents led to a 10,000-strong petition last November calling for the British Government to take a firmer line with Madrid. However, it is unprecedented in modern times for such a large military vessel to assert itself off the Gibraltar coast. Further tensions on the Rock have been aroused by the European Court of Justice which last year upheld a Brussels decision to designate an area of British waters a Spanish natural conservation site. It was later revealed that one of the three judges who made the ruling was formerly Spain’s chief legal officer. Furious: Locals on 'The Rock' are angry at a string of recent minor incursions featuring Spanish police motor boats interfering with pleasure craft and protecting fishermen using illegal practices . Rosario Silva de Lapuerta previously represented Madrid in a case where it had claimed sovereignty over Gibraltar airport. The British Government later complained but ministers’ objections were dismissed by the ECJ. William Dartmouth, UKIP MEP for the South West and Gibraltar, urged the Government to draw a line in the sand following the latest incursion. Under pressure: There are fears that the Spanish government is seeking to ramp up tensions with Britain to deflect attention away from domestic problems threatening to engulf Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy, pictured . He said: 'I hope that the protest will be made in the strongest possible terms. 'It seems a deliberate policy of Spain to constantly provoke tensions in and around Gibraltar. 'The Spanish Government should be left in no doubt that future provocation will not be tolerated.' Gibraltar – which has a population of 30,000 - was ceded to Britain in perpetuity by the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713. A 2002 referendum saw 99 per cent of the electorate reject a deal to share sovereignty with Spain, which has an official policy of seeking to regain the territory by peaceful means. Yesterday, a Foreign and Commonwealth Office spokesman said: 'On February 2, a Spanish naval vessel entered British Gibraltar Territorial Waters. The incursion lasted 19 minutes. 'As Minister for Europe David Lidington has said previously, we condemn these provocative incursions and urge the Spanish government to ensure that they are not repeated. 'We remain confident of UK sovereignty over British Gibraltar Territorial Waters and fully committed to protecting the interests of the people of Gibraltar and their wish to remain under British sovereignty. 'The British Embassy in Madrid will make a formal  written protest to the Spanish Ministry of Foreign Affairs about Saturday’s incursion later today.' Spain’s economy is on the brink of meltdown and unemployment is running at 26 per cent. Last weekend saw violent protests calling for Prime Minister Rajoy’s resignation following allegations that he and other leading members of the ruling Popular Party took payments from a secret £25 million Swiss-based slush fund.","Vessel was spotted cruising irregularly and warned to leave .

"Having a few glasses of wine after work may be doing you more harm than good, according to a new study. Despite a large number of studies suggesting moderate alcohol intake may protect against heart disease, new research done by the University of Sydney looks to challenge this stance. The Alcohol’s Evaporating Health Benefits study explored the association between alcohol consumption and mortality in different age groups to determine the suitability of age-specific alcohol limits as well as different ways of defining 'non-drinkers'. A new study into moderate alcohol intake may disprove the idea that having a few glasses of wine after work may be good for you . One of the authors of the study was Associate Professor Emmanuel Stamatakis, from the University of Sydney's Faculty of Health Sciences and Charles Perkins Centre, said the overwhelming publication of previous research had exaggerated the advantages of having a few wines every day. He said other research had been skewed by the inclusion of people who did not drink in their studies, regardless of their reason for not indulging - where it be abstinence or health problems. This time scientists took a more exact approach in their research and attributed their study's damning results to this point of difference. In the first stage of their study, they used ex-drinkers as a comparison group to moderate drinkers and found protective benefits were the same across all age groups. Associate Professor Emmanuel Stamatakis, from the University of Sydney, said the overwhelming publication of previous research had exaggerated the advantages of having a few drinks every day . But in the second stage, they separated never drinkers out as a comparison group and all protective benefits disappeared. 'Previous studies have considered non-drinkers regardless of why they don’t drink. In those groups who have never drunk there are those who stop drinking because of lifestyle choices or medical advice from doctors or those with problematic drinking patterns or people who have specific health issues from alcohol problems,' Assoc Prof Stamatakis told Daily Mail Australia. 'These ex-drinkers who stop drinking for health reasons have a higher risk of death or get a disease than the rest of the population including moderate drinkers. 'Those ex-drinkers who stop for health-related reasons are essentially making moderate drinkers look better.' He said other research had been skewed by the inclusion of people who did not drink in their studies, regardless of their reason for not indulging - where it be abstinence or health problems . While the study does not answer the question of whether people should indulge or completely give up alcohol all together, Assoc Prof Stamatakis said it did highlight the importance of other strategies to maintain good health. 'The message from this study is Australians should not use claims of alcohol’s health benefits as a license to drink and the alcohol industry should not use health-related messages to promote its products,' he said. 'Australians looking to improve their health should adopt more effective health and wellbeing-promoting strategies like being physically active in their everyday life or adopting regular exercise, rather than take up drinking.'","A study done by the University of Sydney has challenged that a few drinks has health benefits .

"A second juror has been dismissed in the murder trial of former New England Patriots player Aaron Hernandez. Superior Court Judge Susan Garsh said Wednesday she had dismissed a juror for personal reasons that have nothing to do with the case. That's the same explanation she gave to jurors last week when she dismissed another juror. The judge said that juror had discussed evidence in the case. That female juror allegedly  discussed the case outside the courtroom and attended more Patriots games than she told the court. Another one gone: A second juror was dismissed from the Aaron Hernandez murder trial on Wednesday (Hernandez pictured in court on Wednesday) No explanation: Superior Court Judge E Susan Garsh did not elaborate on why another juror was dismissed from the trial on Wednesday. Pictured above in court on February 6, 2015 . Garsh started Wednesday's session by saying she received a note from a juror about an issue. The lawyers, Hernandez and then the juror were brought in to discuss the issue with the judge - though it's not clear what they talked about. When the judge ordered the jury back into the court room, there were 16 jurors left - the one who was questioned was among them. Garsh did not give more details Wednesday. She ended the session for the day after about two hours, citing unspecified scheduling issues. The panel is now made up of 10 women and six men. Twelve will ultimately decide Hernandez's fate. Alternates will be selected randomly immediately before deliberations. Hernandez is accused of the June 2013 killing of Odin Lloyd, who was dating his fiancée's sister. Yesterday, Hernandez's 25-year-old fiancée  Shayanna Jenkins was granted immunity in the trial - a move likely made so that prosecutors can call her to testify. The grant of immunity may mean that the football player's girlfriend will not be able to invoke her Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination if she takes the witness stand. Prosecutors have said Jenkins lied to a grand jury dozens of times including when she said she didn't know what she did with a box she took from the basement of their home. They say it contained possible evidence leading to Mr Lloyd's killer. Jenkins has pleaded not guilty to perjury. Jenkins still lives in Hernandez's North Attleborough mansion with their 2-year-old daughter.","The juror was dismissed Wednesday morning in the murder trial of the former New England Patriots player .

"Hackers proclaiming allegiance to ISIS broke into a Twitter account for a military families' support organization and used it to threaten soldiers' wives. The shady group took over an account on the social network operated by the Military Spouses for Strength nonprofit, then used it to target women who had spoken out against their jihadist organization. 'You think you're safe but the IS [Islamic State] is already here', the hijacked account blasted out to six military wives in succession. Targeted: Amy Bushatz (left) was singled out by the hacker, as was Ashley Broadway-Mack (right) '#CyberCaliphate got into your PC and your smartphone.' The victims were seemingly handpicked because they spoke out in an earlier story about jihadist hackers turning on the military. In the wake of the Twitter account for the Pentagon's Central Command being compromised, the women had spoken to CNN for an article published in January. Liz Snell, who runs Military Spouses for Strength, told the network then: I see being online as a way to stay honest, to stay healthy, to help. 'I don't want that to be hurt because of some threats that are just some dumb hacker. I don't want to let them win that way.' The women, who largely agreed that they would not be intimidated, ended up on the hackers' hitlist as a result. Threats: These messages were sent to six military wives. Threats were also sent to President Obama . Some tweets posted from the account also contained threats to President Obama and his family, NBC reported. The account has since been suspended, and the messages in question deleted. Amy Bushatz, an officer's wife who was targeted, said she was shaken by the messages. She also got sent a friend request from a man apparently affiliated with the hacking group. She told CNN: 'I would be lying if I didn't say it (made) me a little nervous, I don't think you can receive what appears to be a personal threat from ISIS without being nervous.' However, writing later in a blog post she said she had no intention of 'giving them the victory' of staying afraid.","Group took over account of Military Spouses for Strength nonprofit .

"An Oklahoma girl has thanked her dentist for saving her life after a routine checkup lead to the discovery of a serious tumor. Journee Woodard, 11, was having her teeth cleaned at her family dentist in Edmond when the dental hygienist noticed the white of her eyes seemed to be an unusual shade of yellow. 'She asked me to take a look, I took a look and said that does look abnormal,' the dentist, Dr Michael Chandler, told KFOR 4. On Dr Chandler's advice, Journee's mother, Anna Woodard, took her daughter for a checkup. Scroll down  for video . Saved: A routine teeth cleaning ended up saving the life of Journee Woodard, 11, who was found to have a large tumor on her pancreas . Dentist: Dr Michael Chandler suggested Journee seek medical advice straight away after realizing her eyes were an 'abnormal' shade of yellow . Doctors were also worried about the color of Journee's eyes and ordered a CAT scan and MRI. The results showed that Journee had a large mass on her liver and pancreas. She was admitted to the University of Oklahoma Childrens Hospital straight away. According to a fundraising page set up on You Caring, the mass turned out to be a tumor that was the size of a grape fruit. Doctors wasted no time in operating and rushed Journee into surgery. They had to perform a Whipple procedure to remove part of Journee's pancreas, stomach, gall bladder and part of the intestine. Journee's mother said she remained in the ICU for the next seven to 10 days. 'Imagine taking your little girl to the dentist on a Monday morning for a routine cleaning, and by Friday, she is fighting for her life,' Mrs Woodard said. ICU: Journee is now recovering in hospital after undergoing a nine hour operation to remove the tumor . On Wednesday Mrs Woodard said Journee had been taken off solid foods because of the amount of pancreatic fluid she is producing, but is otherwise in 'good spirits'. 'We are still anxiously awaiting the biopsy results and will update further. Thank you so much again for everyone's continued love, prayers, support and amazing generosity,' Mrs Woodard put on You Caring. The family have so far raised over $5,000 on the website. Mrs Woodard and her husband said their jobs do not offer paid time off and they are spending all their time in hospital with Journee. 'We are completely without any income to cover expenses for our other three kids, and any other funds raised will go to scratch the surface of medical expenses that her insurance won't cover, which has already exceeeded the $100,000 mark,' Mrs Woodard wrote.","Journee Woodard, 11, was having her teeth cleaned when her dentist said her eyes were an 'abnormal' color and recommended she have it checked .

"Apple has become the first company to reach a market value of $700 billion. Shares rose 1.9 percent to close at $122.02, lifting Apple's market value to $710 billion, and making it the first company to hit the $700 billion milestone. Apple chief executive Tim Cook, speaking at the Goldman Sachs Technology & Internet Conference, said Apple was hitting its stride. Scroll down for video . how much? Apple became the first company to reach a market value of $700 billion. Tim Cook (pictured) revealed at the Goldman Sachs Technology & Internet Conference in San Francisco . The U.S. tech giant recently posted record revenue of $74.6 billion (£49.2bn) for the three months to December 31, outstripping the quarterly GDP of Israel, Greece or Denmark. Apple's cash pile is now $178 billion (£117bn), the equivalent to $556 for every American and bigger than the £95billion budget for Britain's National Health Service. Its landmark performance was driven by record-breaking sales for its iPhone 6 and 6 plus, with the firm revealing it sold 34,000 handsets every hour for the entire quarter. 'We've taken (the mobile operating system) iOS and extended it into your car, into your home, into your health. All of these are really critical parts of your life,' Cook said. 'We want one seamless kind of life. 'And so, I think that is huge for our future...We also did a lot of things to further our global footprint. And so, if you look at what we've done in China, we've opened more stores there. 'We've opened a lot more distribution there. Through the world, we've opened almost 20,000 new points of sale. 'We've opened 27 new Apple Stores, lot of flagship stores.' Cook said Apple took some $50 billion in revenue in emerging markets over the past calendar year. Brian White, analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald, said the leading tech company has even more room to grow. 'Given Apple's powerful iPhone cycle, a big 4G ramp in China and the upcoming launch of Apple Watch in April, we believe there is still plenty to look forward to at Apple during this transformational cycle,' he said in a note to clients. 'At the same time, we believe Apple's valuation has room to expand from depressed levels.' Apple Inc Chief Executive Tim Cook said on Tuesday the technology company is investing $850 million to help build a solar farm in California with solar panel maker First Solar. The project in Monterey County, California will provide enough energy for 60,000 homes as well as Apple's future head office in nearby Cupertino, Cook said at a Goldman Sachs technology conference in San Francisco. ""We know in Apple that climate change is real. The time for talk is passed,"" he said. ""The time for action is now."" First Solar, based in Tempe, Arizona, manufactures solar panels and also builds solar power plants, many of which it sells to power producers. Construction of the 2,900-acre California Flats Solar Project is expected to start in mid-2015 and finish by the end of next year, First Solar said in a statement. Apple will receive electricity from 130 megawatts of capacity under a 25-year purchase agreement, the largest in the industry to provide clean energy to a commercial end user, First Solar said. Output of the project's remaining 150 megawatts will go to Pacific Gas and Electric Co (PCG_pa.A). Apple already uses renewable energy to power its data centers. Last week, it said it would invest $2 billion over 10 years to convert a failed sapphire glass plant in Arizona into a data center that would be powered mostly by solar energy. ""Apple still has work to do to reduce its environmental footprint, but other Fortune 500 CEOs would be well served to make a study of Tim Cook,"" Greenpeace said in a statement following Tuesday's announcement. Apple shares remain valued at reasonable levels, according to analysts, because of the whopping $18 billion quarterly profit reported recently by the iPhone and iPad maker. Using the price-earnings ratio favored by Wall Street, Apple is valued at around 16 times its annual earnings, but Fitzgerald said the value was only around 10 times the projected earnings for the next fiscal year. Apple is far ahead in market value from the number two company, oil giant Exxon Mobil, worth some $382 billion at the market close. The Apple watch is set to launch in April ©Loic Venance (AFP/File) The record Apple quarterly profit -- on unprecedented revenue of $74.6 billion -- was driven by the sale of 74.5 million iPhones, well ahead of most analysts' expectations. Analysts are also seeing expanded adoption of the Apple Pay system that enables customers to purchase items with a tap of their iPhone, and many predict strong demand for the Apple Watch set for release in April. Separately, Apple agreed to commit $848 million for solar energy to power its data centers, according to a statement from First Solar, Inc. Cook called the effort 'our biggest, boldest, and most ambitious project ever' and said it was part of Apple's commitment on clean energy and corporate responsibility. Apple will receive electricity from 130 megawatts under a 25-year power purchase agreement, 'the largest agreement in the industry to provide clean energy to a commercial end user,' the solar firm said. The 2,900-acre California Flats Solar Project occupies part of a property owned by Hearst Corporation in Cholame, California, with construction set to start this year. Apple unveiled plans earlier this month to pump $2 billion over the coming decade into a solar-powered data center 'global command' facility in the southwest state of Arizona.","CEO Tim Cook said Apple was 'hitting its stride'

"A portrait of string instrument crafter Antonio Stradivari. It has been claimed his highly sought after violins were developed by accident . Their more powerful and fuller sound has seen them acknowledged as the best violins ever crafted. But those created by Antonio Stradivari would only go on to become the world’s most expensive musical instruments as a result of errors in their creation, it is claimed. An analysis of hundreds of instruments made in his legendary workshop has identified the key design features that give them more power and a fuller sound. Acoustic experts found that vital to the sound is the shape and length of the violin’s f-shaped holes through which air escapes. The more elongated these are, the more noise the instrument can produce. The thickness of a violin’s back plate also contributes to its acoustic power. But a model created from the measurements of technical drawings of Cremonese-era violins from museums, collector databases and books, as well as X-ray and CAT scans of the instruments, suggests the alterations to the traditional holes were unintentional – they most likely came about by craftsmanship error as they tried to replicate an original blueprint. The researchers found the 17th and 18th century ‘golden age’ violins crafted by Stradivari and the other Cremonese masters Giuseppe Guarneri Del Gesu and Andrea Amati slowly evolved to more elongated f-holes and thicker back plates, rather than an obvious shift in design. Professor Nicholas Makris, of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, in Boston, said: ‘We found if you try to replicate a sound hole exactly from the last one you made, you will always have a little error. ‘You are cutting with a knife into thin wood and you cannot get it perfectly, and the error we report is about 2 per cent … always within what would have happened if it was an evolutionary change, accidentally from random fluctuations.’ In 2011 a Stradivarius sold at auction for almost £10million. While each violin maker undoubtedly possessed a good ear, whether they recognised the particular design elements that contribute to a more powerful sound is still up for debate. Professor Makris said: ‘People had to be listening, and had to be picking things that were more efficient, and were making good selection of what instrument to replicate. ‘Whether they understood, ‘Oh, we need to make the sound hole more slender,’ we cannot say. But they definitely knew what was a better instrument to replicate.’ Stradivarius violins, such as the two pictured, are considered to be the greatest violins ever crafted and can sell for millions . The study published in the Proceedings of the Royal Society took seven years and involved examining the acoustic dynamics of stringed instruments from the oud, lute, and medieval fiddles to the guitar and ultimately the violin, a period spanning 800 years. During this time sound-hole shape evolved from a simple round shape to a semicircle, which eventually morphed into a c-shape that grew more elongated, ultimately assuming the f-shape of the violin. The perimeter of these shapes steadily grew, while the area of the interior void gradually decreased. The results may be useful for master violin makers looking to design more powerful, fuller-sounding instruments, although Professor Makris acknowledges there is more to producing a quality violin than adjusting a few parameters. He added: ‘Mystery is good, and there is magic in violin making. Some makers, I do not know how they do it, it is an art form. They have their techniques and methods. But here, for us, it is good to understand scientifically as much as you can.'","The perfections of Stradivarius violins were created by error, it is claimed .

"She's the actress who shot to fame as Rachel Green and cemented her place in our hearts with her marriage with Brad Pitt. Jennifer Aniston is a woman whose, career, love life and struggles for a baby have been followed in minute detail for the last 20 years. As the star turns 46 today, we look back over how she became Hollywood's favourite sweetheart. Scroll down for video . Jennifer Aniston has spent the last two decades living under the public's gaze. As the actress turns 46 today, FEMAIL looks back at her biggest highs and lows. (Pictured: Jennifer  at the 30th Annual Santa Barbara International Film Festival in January) Since 1994, millions of women have grown up using Jennifer Aniston as a type of older sister. When the actress first came onto our screens as Rachel Green in 1994, her hairstyle spawned hundreds of thousands of copycats in salons across the western world. When she gave the credit for her bikini body to The Atkins Diet, those same women ditched their meals of lettuce and grilled fish for steak and eggs. And after  she made the move to the silver screen, her legions of fans used their expendable income to turn her movies into Box Office gold. We look back at some of the biggest highs and lows of Hollywood's ultimate Girl Next Door over the last two decades... The Brad Years: Our Love Of Her Love Life . Jennifer's five-year marriage to Brad Pitt was one of the most watched romances in celebrity history. They were Hollywood's golden couple - gorgeous, happy and seemingly totally untouchable. The world became obsessed with Jennifer's seemingly perfect marriage to Brad Pitt . But Jennifer became the poster girl for  women scorned when the actor, now 51, ended their marriage and moved on with Angelina Jolie in 2005. At the time, it  was widely reported that Brad had started his relationship with Angelina whilst they were filming Mr and Mrs Smith together, and he was still with Jennifer. Three years later, Angelina appeared to confirm their on-set affair, when she said of the film: 'Not a lot of people get to see a movie where their parents fell in love.' Later that year, Jennifer responded in an interview with American Vogue, where she referred to Angelina's  comments as, 'very uncool,' and, 'inappropriate.' Jennifer is now happily engaged to Justin Theroux, who she started dating in 2012 . In her first interview post-split in Vanity Fair in 2008, Jennifer went into detail about her tears, heartbreak and pain over the affair. But the article appeared to give the star closure and she had soon bounced back by dating John Mayer, Paul Sculfor and Vince Vaughn, before eventually meeting her now fiance Justin Theroux. Several years on, the incident is well and truly under the bridge and recently Jennifer insisted there is no longer any bad blood between her and Angelina. In an interview with Entertainment Tonight, she said: 'I think that's slowly coming to an end. I really do. 'It's just tiresome and old. It's like an old leather shoe. 'No, let's buy a new pair of shiny shoes.' The 'Rachel' During her time on the hit comedy show FRIENDS Jen became famous not just for her hilarious character Rachel Green, but for the 'Rachel' haircut. The layered look, that was styled by her still hairdresser Chris McMillan became one of the most asked for cuts of the 90s. The 'Rachel' haircut became one of the biggest hits of the 90s but Jennifer has since referred to it as a 'disaster' Jennifer has since spoken about how difficult the look was to maintain. She said: 'The Rachel' was one of the hardest hairstyles to maintain. 'Me and the blow dryer and the hairbrush weren't meant for each other. 'It really was a ""hairdo.""' Not only did the actress find it impossible to maintain, she has since revealed that she thought it was ugly. Jennifer with the rest of the cast of friends (L-R) Courteney Cox, Matt Le Blanc, Lisa Kudrow, Matthew Perry and David Schwimmer . In an interview with Allure magazine, she said: 'I think it was the ugliest haircut I've ever seen. How did that thing have legs?' 'It was all anyone ever wanted to know about, all Chris ever got asked to do. 'I liked it at the time, but I started to grow it out after about eight months. 'But it just wouldn't die.' The 'Will She, Won't She' Child Debate . Whether or not Jennifer will have children has been a source of great debate among the general public for years. Thousands of column inches in magazines have speculated on whether the actress is sporting a tiny bump, something the actress has revealed has been tough to endure. Jennifer has revealed that she and Justin are trying for a baby . Following her split from Brad, it was claimed that she hadn't wanted children, something which she went on to deny in her 2008 Vanity Fair interview. She said: 'A man divorcing would never be accused of choosing career over children. That really p**sed me off. 'I've never in my life said I didn't want to have children. I did and I do and I will! 'The women that inspire me are the ones who have careers and children; why would I want to limit myself? 'I've always wanted to have children, and I would never give up that experience for a career. 'I want to have it all.' Jennifer, who looked stunning on the red carpet at the SAG Awards this year, has long spoken of her desire to have children . However, ten years on and Jennifer is still battling speculation over whether she will have a child, this with Justin. In 2014, she was forced to once again to respond to the claims. She said: 'I don't have this sort of checklist of things that have to be done, and if they're not checked, then I've failed some part of my feminism or my value as a woman because I haven't birthed a child. 'I've birthed a lot of things and feel like I've mothered many things, and I don't think it's fair to put that pressure on people.' And in 2015 she revealed to Hollywood Reporter that she and Justin are trying for a child, saying: 'Listen, that's a topic that's so exhausted. 'I get nervous around that, just because it's very personal. 'Who knows if it's going to happen? 'It's been a want. We're doing our best.' The grown up years . Despite being one of the highest earning actresses in Hollywood, Jennifer's film career has always been criticised for being a little lacklustre. She is best known for staring in rom-coms like Along Came Polly, He's Just Not That Into You and The Break-Up. Jennifer looked happy at the unveiling of her Walk of Fame star in Hollywood in 2012 . However, this year Jennifer's career has taken a turn for the  serious. After starring in the critically acclaimed Cake, Jennifer was even nominated for a SAG Award. This is the first time the actress has truly gained recognition for her talents and seemingly signals a move away from the films she has starred in before. Jennifer has previously revealed that she enjoys the challenge of making people see that she is more than just a sitcom star, 'It excites me, actually,' she once said. After the success of her first foray into serious acting, it seems like we will be seeing much more of grown-up Jennifer as she reaches her mid-forties.","Jennifer Aniston tuns 46 today .

"Hopes were high for the new Hello Kitty theme park aimed at Chinese fans when it opened its doors at the start of 2015 to a media frenzy. But the £210 million theme park in east China’s Zhejiang province have so far been more than simply lack-lustre. The theme park centred around the iconic character invented in 1974 is described as 'cheesy' and 'boring' by visitors, and a long detailed review by one internet blogger brands it 'a mess'. Not quite Disneyland: The Hello Kitty theme park has attracted negative reviews despite its vast costs . A feature on English language website Smartshangai.com, pulls the theme park apart, with blogger Ian Louisell, describing it as having 'inconsistent branding, mediocre rides, and some of the most wretched food I've encountered in seven years in China.' The article was picked up by many on Twitter, with Brian DeMare retweeting it alongside his reaction, 'Report on the new Hello Kitty park outside of Shanghai. In short, don't go.' The theme park launched by Japanese company Sanrio, who created Hello Kitty in 1974, and entertainment design firm Hettema Group, California, is in Anji, an area known for its rich forests and natural scenery, but clearly not for its transport links. Hello Kitty Park will be China's first large scale amusement park scheduled to open to the public on New Year's day . People prepare a celebration to mark the completion of the construction of Hello Kitty Park . The official site says a shuttle bus runs from the Anji County Bus Terminal to the park. But a reviewer on TripAdvisor called Nehow a visit to the theme park 'an arduous trek', pointing out that with no railway at Anji, visitors must find another way of getting to the Anji bus terminal. 'Even getting to the bus terminal is problematic in itself. To get there, you must first take a bus for an hour or so from Huzhou Station, the closest high-speed railway stop, or from a station in Hangzhou...travelers who are flying in from other parts of Asia are probably looking at a minimum two-night stay in China due to logistics alone.' As for the food being served in the park based around the popular little white cat with the red bow, Louisell sums up, 'Worse than any train food you'll find in China, but five times as expensive.' Despite the fanfare for the park, positive reviews have not been forthcoming ... yet . Not so great? One commenter calls the park, set in Anji, east China’s Zhejiang province a 'despicable project' An anonymous commenter calls the park a 'despicable project', while various comments on Chinese site Livedoor.com include, 'cheesy' 'boring' 'paint smells fill the park' and say the prices of food and drink are 'stupidly high'. The Hettema Group website describes the Hello Kitty Park as a ‘a very special home-away-from home for Hello Kitty and all her friends. Nestled within the green hills of Anji, China, Hello Kitty Park celebrates a region whose distinctive culture has grown up around the treasures of the natural world.'","Food described as 'worse than any train food, but five times as expensive'

"The social media accounts of one of the two men charged with plotting a terrorist attack involving large knives on Wednesday, have revealed the extremist was a fashion-loving weightlifter with a keen eye for expensive jewellery. Pictures of Mohammad Kiad on his Facebook page show him sporting expensive watches and suits as well as taking numerous selfies while at the gym. In contrast to the snaps of him in shiny sparkling tight pants, other pictures show him wearing traditional white Islamic clothing and headpieces. However in person, the 25-year-old nurse who worked as a removalist has been described as a quiet man who never mentioned his religion, according to Fairfax. Mr Kiad and his Iraqi born housemate Omar Al-Kutobi, 24, were arrested in their shared squalid granny flat at Fairfield, western Sydney, on Tuesday afternoon, where a police raid allegedly uncovered a machete, a hunting knife, an Islamic State flag and a video featuring both the men, with one recorded making threats of carrying out a terrorist attack. Both men  arrived in Australia from the Middle East seeking a better life as refugees but allegedly became radicalised in recent months, it has been claimed. Scroll down for video . Mohammad Kiad, 25 (right), and his Iraqi born housemate Omar Al-Kutobi, 24 (left), were arrested on terror charges in their shared squalid granny flat at Fairfield on Tuesday . On Thursday, accused terrorist Kiad accidentally appeared briefly in court. Kiad popped up on screens at Central Local Court by audio visual link from Silverwater prison, where he is being held with his co-accused Omar al-Kutobi in western Sydney. He was dressed in prison greens, wore glasses and his beard was trimmed close to his face. Bail applications by both men were set aside on a farcical day of hearings at Central when a power blackout and then a computer failure delayed proceedings. Mohammad Kiad's name was read out by the Commonwealth prosecutor and he was brought into the audio visual room at Silverwater prison by mistake. Deone Provera, a solicitor assisting Legal Aid in the two men's representation, did not require either man's appearance. Mr Provera had their release applications set down for March16. Commonwealth DPP prosecutor Kay Marenos said the brief of evidence against the men was four pages long 'but that is likely to change' and included photographs and a short video. Immigration Minister Peter Dutton told the Today Show on Thursday Kiad, from Kuwait, and Al-Kutobi, from Iraq, were granted refugee status. Al-Kutobi was granted citizenship in 2013 and was studying to be a nurse after he arrived in Australia by plane in 2009. The Daily Telegraph alleges a senior intelligence source has confirmed he arrived in the country with false documentation. Facebook pictures of  Kiad, who immigrated to Australia from Kuwait in 2009, revealed his fashion interest and showed him sporting expensive watches and suits as well as making some strange fashion statements . A keen weight-lifter, the 25-year-old removalist also shared selfies of himself at the gym . Mr Kiad entered Australia in 2012, where he had worked as a nurse - but when he arrived in Australia he found he could not transfer his skills. He was granted a visa under the family and spousal visa arrangements and recently took up a job as a removalist but was fired and was on the dole at the time of his arrest, it has been reported. Mr Dutton told the Today Show: 'We've stopped the boats now and we need to make sure they remain stopped.’ However, Today Show host Karl Stefanovic pointed out: 'This guy came by plane though.’ Attorney-General George Brandis told parliament on Wednesday: 'Significantly, police also located a video recording of one suspect kneeling in front of an ISIL (IS) flag, with the knife and machete, making a politically-motivated statement, threatening to undertake violent acts with those weapons.' A Sydney police station and officers on the street were revealed to have been the the targets with attacks scheduled for just before midnight on Tuesday, Channel Nine reported. In contrast to the snaps of him in shiny  pants, other pictures show him wearing traditional white Islamic clothing and headpieces . Pictures of the duo from mid-2013 show them poking faces and smoking shisha together. Mr Al-Kutobi was granted citizenship in 2013 and was studying to be a nurse while Mr Kiad, originally from Kuwait where he immigrated from in 2009, was reported to have been recently fired from his removalist job. While some neighbours told Fairfax that he was 'friendly', 'open minded about religion' and 'never talked about Islam', others admitted he and Mr Al-Katobi had begun acting differently after the anti-terror raids in western Sydney last September. 'He began wearing a scarf, just like ISIS and Mohammad, he grew a long beard,' Neighbour Michael David said of Al-Kutobi. 'I heard them praying in there [the granny flat] and reading the Koran,' said Mr David, who speaks Arabic. Ms Jeisele-Brown said the pair had fallen out with another neighbour over the last month or two for 'speaking sharp' and that she had been upset with them after finding a religious picture of hers dumped in the rubbish bin. Pictured smoking shisha in mid-2013: The mens' neighbours said they mostly kept to themselves but admitted their behaviour had changed drastically in the last few months following police raids in western Sydney and the Martin Place siege . 'I had been in hospital having chemotherapy and when I came back home my picture of Jesus Christ was missing,' she said. 'I found it in the rubbish. I don't know who dumped it but I thought ... I didn't say anything.' Neighbours Teresita Heisele-Brown said she had noticed that after the Martin place siege, the two men had had lengthy discussions in Arabic and had watched a lot of television, perhaps coverage of the a siege. She said when the police came around to arrest the pair, Mohammad had pretended he didn't speak English. She said detectives had made the men lie on the ground while they handcuffed them. Their home, workplaces and cars were all searched by police. On Thursday, accused terrorist Kiad accidentally appeared briefly in court.

"Suspended CBS Sports basketball analyst Greg Anthony reached a plea agreement with authorities on Wednesday to a charge of soliciting prostitution. Anthony will have the misdemeanor charge dropped if he does 32 hours of community service, according to the spokeswoman for the District of Columbia Superior Court. Anthony will perform the community service in Florida as part of the deferred prosecution agreement. Greg Anthony's (above) has reached a plea in his prostitution charge and will serve 32 hours of community service . Anthony is married to Dr. Chere Lucas Anthony (above), a dermatologist, and the couple have a 10-month-old daughter . Details of former New York Knicks stars and sports commentator Greg Anthony's recent arrest for soliciting an undercover cop were recently released and revealed the events of the evening. A police report showed that Anthony reached out to the officer through the website Backpage.com on January 16, and had them meet him at the Doubletree Hotel in Washington, DC where he was staying. Then, after agreeing on a cost of $80 for sex, Anthony told the officer he wanted them to dress up. The officer arrived a little after 5:45pm, and almost immediately says to Anthony; 'So $80 for intercourse?' Anthony is caught off guard, saying he does not want to talk about that, to which the officer responds; 'I just need to know so I don’t have any surprises.' They then ask of Antony would like to have intercourse or oral sex, to which he says; 'Ummm yeah that's fine.' Finally, just before backup is called in, the officer asks; 'You want me to dress up?' 'Oh yeah,' says Anthony. He is now scheduled to appear in court on February 2 and faces a misdemeanor charge of solicitation. Anthony was in town that weekend to announce an NCAA game between Michigan State and Maryland for CBS. The network, and Turner Sports, quickly announced they would be suspending Anthony. 'Greg Anthony will not be working again for CBS this season,' said a spokesperson. 'I made a mistake,' Anthony said in a statement. 'With this lapse of judgment, I embarrassed many, including myself. I will work to regain the trust that I have lost, and the first step is saying that I am sorry.' Anthony (43 above) when he played for the Detroit Pistons . Anthony, 47, started his NBA career with the Knicks and played in New York for four years before being picked up by the Vancouver Grizzlies in the 1995 NBA expansion draft. He finished with the Milwaukee Bucks after 11 seasons in the NBA, averaging 7.3 points per game over his entire career.

"The black market is booming thanks to the 'invisibility' of online shopping as more and more criminals smuggle guns, drugs and counterfeit goods into Britain through the post. More than a million parcels containing such items are sent to British homes each year, costing the taxman more than £3billion, a year-long study has revealed. And efforts to crack down on the illicit trade are hampered by poor co-operation between agencies such as Revenue & Customs and the Border Force. Scroll down for video . Guns, broken down into component parts, are being smuggled into Britain from the U.S. via parcel post . Black market alcohol and tobacco is entering Britain from Poland, while counterfeit clothing often comes from China . Some of the goods entering Britain by mail include tobacco from Malaysia and Singapore, counterfeit clothing from China, drugs from India and Hong Kong, and guns from the U.S., The Times reported. The shocking figures were revealed following a year-long study by the Royal United Services Institute, which concluded online shopping was assisting organised crime groups in masking smaller but more frequent package deliveries. It stated: 'The digital revolution now drives organised crime - with the click of a mouse, delivery by Parcelforce or private courier... it has morphed into an invisible trade, unseen by communities and out of the reach of law enforcement.' One of the most commonly smuggled products is illegal tobacco, which is then sold under the counter in shops throughout Britain. Last year it was reported that efforts to reduce smoking and improve health were being hampered by the black market trade of millions of illegal cigarettes filled with excrement, dead flies and asbestos. The Local Government Association (LGA) said fake cigarettes also posed a fire risk, damaged honest businesses and cost the UK economy around £3billion a year in unpaid duty. Recent council efforts to crack down on the illicit trade led to the seizure of hundreds of thousands of illegal cigarettes in Wolverhampton, Bristol and Nottingham. One of the products most commonly smuggled into Britain is black market tobacco, which often comes from eastern Europe, India, Malaysia or Singapore . Southwark, Bexley, Bromley, Greenwich, Lambeth and Lewisham councils formed a partnership to tackle the black market trade of 114 million illicit cigarettes which are estimated to be sold in the area each year. Trading standards officers found fake cigarettes hidden inside vacuum cleaners, under floorboards and in toilet cisterns. Some contained asbestos, mould, dust, dead flies, rat droppings and human excrement. Many featured much higher levels of toxic ingredients such as tar, nicotine, carbon monoxide, lead, cadmium and arsenic than genuine cigarettes. Fake cigarettes also pose an increased fire risk as they do not include designs that ensure that, once lit, a cigarette will self-extinguish if it is not actively smoked. This reduces the chances of them starting a fire if they are left burning in an ashtray, dropped or if the smoker falls asleep.","Black market booming thanks to 'invisibility' provided by online shopping .

"Edvard Musik, 46, admitted causing death by dangerous driving after he ploughed into the back of Angela Knight's car and killed her . A Lithuanian lorry driver who killed a mother after he crashed into the back of her car while fiddling with his satnav on the motorway has been jailed for four years. Edvard Musik had been driving for 13 hours across Europe and made several drop offs in England before he caused the multi-vehicle crash on the M606 in Bradford, West Yorkshire, a court heard. Mother-of-two, Angela Knight, 47, was directly in front of his 35-tonne articulated lorry in queuing traffic when he ploughed into the back of her Ford Fiesta and caused her 'catastrophic injuries'. Another lorry and a car were involved in the crash, shortly after 2pm on October 7 last year, which left two other people injured and a 60-year-old seriously hurt. Bradford Crown Court heard the former Russian army soldier was driving at around 45mph on the approach to a junction at the Staygate roundabout on the northbound carriageway. Prosecutor Jonathan Sharp said: 'A connection to his sat nav had become loose, and he was leaning across the cab in order to deal with it. 'He returned his attention to the road just before he was to collide with the Fiesta. As the defendant caught the rear of the Fiesta, the impact speed was between 41 and 45 mph. 'The Fiesta spun several times, and collided hard with the Renault Laguna in front of it. The Laguna, in turn, collided with a Morrisons lorry.' Mrs Knight, of Lymm, Cheshire, was on her way to visit one of her daughters, Sophie, 19, who was a student at the University of Bradford. The 47-year-old, who was due to remarry in December last year, suffered 'catastrophic injuries to her skull and brain' and was pronounced dead at the scene. Musik, 46, started his shift at 1am in Europe that day and travelled to Dover, made deliveries in Birmingham before travelling to Bradford but had taken his regulation number of breaks. The Lithuanian national, who appeared in court alongside an interpreter, pleaded guilty to causing death by dangerous driving and wept as he was jailed by Judge Roger Thomas QC. The court heard he had no previous convictions or any driving offences and had been driving lorries for almost 30 years after leaving the Russian army in 1988. The scene of the accident on October 7 last year. On the left, the northbound carriageway was closed and temporary barriers were put up while the southbound carriageway, on the right, was re-opened . Mitigating Paul Walker told the court Musik had written a letter to Mrs Knight's family to apologise for the 'horrific accident' and was in tears at the roadside. Jailing Musik, Judge Thomas told him: 'This was an utterly avoidable accident if you were paying any attention whatsoever. It was a grossly avoidable distraction. 'The consequences of that for Mrs Knight's family and friends are truly terrible. Whatever sentence I pass will be of very little comfort to them. 'You lifted out of your seat and were fiddling with a sat nav in your vehicle. You hit the back of Mrs Knight's car and you did so at a considerable speed, in these circumstances at over 40mph. 'Of course, as a HGV driver, you had a large responsibility of driving competently and carefully. Your remorse and regret is heartfelt and genuine.' Musik, of Leicester, East Midlands, was also banned from driving for five years. After the case, Sergeant Carole Greaves, of the Major Collision and Enquiry Team at West Yorkshire Police, said: 'This case is another tragic reminder of what can happen when a motorist takes their eyes off the road. 'It is vital that road users pay attention at all times as situations can change in a split-second. 'Musik pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity to causing this collision and the sentence he has received reflects that, but the consequences of his actions will stay with him for the rest of his life.'","Edvard Musik had driven for 13 hours across Europe when crash happened .

"Epsom has confirmed that the start of this year’s Investec Derby on June 6 will be pushed back by half an hour in an effort to halt the alarming slump in viewing figures. The plan for a 4.30pm fifth-race slot with the meeting also starting at the later time of 2pm was revealed by Sportsmail in October amid speculation that the track and sponsors were even considering an evening start for the biggest Flat race of the British season. Australia ridden by Joseph O'Brien wins The Investec Derby at Epsom Racecourse in June last year . Such a move was not an option this summer with the Champions League final also rostered for June 6. The need for Buckingham Palace approval with attendance of the Queen being regarded as crucial plus the potential of spiralling police costs are likely to have been other factors for that idea being parked, at least for time being. But Epsom supremo Rupert Trevelyan made it clear that an evening Derby has not completely been removed from the agenda when he said: ’At this stage this is the extent of our changes to race times but we will review following the 2015 Investec Derby Festival.’ Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip on the Royal Balcony at the Epsom Investec Derby last summer .

The now 34-year-old was diagnosed with advanced cervical cancer in 2012 . Mrs Tonner and her husband Ian, a fire officer, married on December 28, 2012, at a country home in Warwickshire. She said: 'By that stage, the cancer was in my lymph nodes and doctors said ""we don't think you should wait""' Not only that, the 34-year-old believes her diagnosis has led her to have more fun and excitement than many people achieve in a lifetime. Not only has she sneaked into Buckingham Palace for a garden party, she has met Prince Charles and the Queen, been on a helicopter ride and spent hours having fun with her ten-year-old daughter, Grace. The former police officer, from Stratford-Upon-Avon, Warwickshire, who was medically retired from her job in 2012, said: 'Weirdly, cancer has made me more positive about life. 'It's encouraged me to embrace life.' Mrs Tonner was diagnosed with type 2B cervical cancer in March 2012 when she was 30. It followed a smear test in winter 2011. 'I had been bleeding but had ignored having a smear test because I was too embarrassed,' she said. 'But I was at the doctors for something else and mentioned that I was bleeding. 'The nurse insisted I had a smear test.' Mrs Tonner (with husband Ian) had been diagnosed with the disease after a smear test. She had initially delayed having it as she was embarrassed - but a nurse insisted she have one after she mentioned bleeding . Despite undergoing chemotherapy and radiotherapy, in September 2012 Mrs Tonner was given the devastating news that the cancer had spread to her pelvis and lymph nodes and was 'incurable' THINGS ACHIEVED SO FAR... Get married . Move house . Raise money for charity . Go on holiday every year . Focus more on home life . Make Grace our priority – always make time for her school pays . Go on a helicopter ride . Go to London and see West End shows . Make every half-term an adventure . After tea at The Ritz and The Dorchester . Meet the Queen . Meet Steph and Dom from Gogglebox . Get pet dog . And the last outstanding thing.... Meet the singer Will Young . Just weeks later, in March 2012, Mrs Tonner was referred University Hospital Coventry, where doctors revealed her symptoms were actually those of cancer. Despite undergoing chemotherapy and radiotherapy, in September that year there was more bad news - the cancer had spread to her pelvis and lymph nodes and was 'incurable'. As a next step, she needed more radiotherapy. 'Doctors said I had between six and 12 months,' she said. 'They knew my wedding was in April 2013 and told me it was a good idea to move it forward.' Mrs Tonner and her husband Ian, a fire officer, married on December 28, 2012, at a country home in Warwickshire. 'By that stage the cancer was in my lymph nodes and the doctors had said ""we don't think you should wait to get married"". 'I had already picked my dress so it was all okay – I just handed over money and let other people organise it. 'It was a really lovely day although I was really tired. 'But we were aware we didn't have long. They had said 'six to 12 months' in October 2012 so we knew we were living on a deadline.' And it was this deadline prompted the couple to make changes. 'After the initial shock, we decided we needed to make the best of the time we had,' said Mrs Tonner. 'We moved house because we were doing up the one we currently lived in - and wanted our free time to be free.' After the initial shock of the diagnosis, Mrs Tonner (pictured at Ascot) decided to make the most of the time she had left. She compiled a bucket list and vowed to spend as much time with her family as possible . Mrs Tonner and a friend in the house belonging to Gogglebox stars Steph and Dom . She and her friends also participated in a 10km race to raise money for a cancer charity . Previously a Police Community Support Officer, she also wanted to spend as much time as she could with her family. 'We wanted our free time to be spent together and with Grace,' she said. Shortly afterwards, she had the epiphany to write a bucket list before she died - and raise money for charity. 'I did a 10km race with all my friends for a cancer charity,' Mrs Tonner said. 'We go on holiday as often as we can, we went on a helicopter ride over Warwickshire and we've  been to loads of shows in London. 'We've also had afternoon tea in The Savoy and The Ritz - and every half-term is an adventure.' One of her highlights was going to Buckingham Palace for a garden party. She saw the Queen, Prince Charles and Princess Anne. She continued: 'One of my best friends is in the RAF and was invited to a garden party but unfortunately got shingles and couldn't go so I went. 'We go on holiday as often as we can, we went on a helicopter ride over Warwickshire and we've been to loads of shows in London,' Mrs Tonner added . She is now working with the cancer charity Macmillan to promote its latest campaign - to raise awareness of the estimated 550,000 people in the UK who suffer with loneliness as a result of their cancer . 'It was a fab day. The Queen was there – but I forgot to take lots of pictures.' She also visited the home of Gogglebox's posh couple Steph and Dom, who she loves. She said: 'Being diagnosed with cancer has changed me completely. 'Cancer has changed me for the better – it's made me more positive. 'I don't know what the future holds. Doctors are unsure. They didn't expect me to be here. 'It's watch and wait.' Mrs Tonner's story features in Macmillan Cancer Support's Isolation Box which will take over London Paddington Station today as part of its Not Alone campaign. The interactive box, will allow people outside to see in but stop the person inside seeing out. The aim is to raise awareness of the estimated 550,000 people in the UK who suffer with loneliness as a result of their cancer.","Kate Tonner, 34, was diagnosed with cervical cancer in March 2012 .

"They may have been attempting to make peace but the tensions in the air were all too clear as the presidents of Russia and Ukraine met for crisis talks. Against a backdrop of escalating conflict in eastern Ukraine, one telltale image shows Vladimir Putin giving a smug smile while Petro Poroshenko glares across the table at the Russian leader during the meeting in the Belarusian capital Minsk today. The line-up for the world's most awkward tea party was completed by the leaders of France and Germany, Francois Hollande and Angela Merkel, who joined Putin and Poroshenko for drinks, biscuits and nibbles. Scroll down for video .

Putin and Poroshenko shake hands while France President Francois Hollande looks on (left) Belarus' President Alexander Lukashenko (left) attempts to lighten the mood while Presidents Putin and Poroshenko (second left and far right) continue to eye each other up . In the same image President Hollande and Chancellor Merkel looked decidedly ill at ease themselves, perched uneasily next to each other on a sofa. Putin and Poroshenko had earlier shaken hands anything but warmly after the Ukrainian leader warned on arrival that without a de-escalation of the conflict and a ceasefire, the situation in the east of the country would get 'out of control'. The four leaders met alone at around 5.15pm before heading for a full summit with their delegations later, as part of a Franco-German lead attempt to end the fighting. A Belarusian representative said the four leaders meeting alone was an unexpected break with diplomatic procedure and it was not clear whether they would meet with their delegations as planned. The four were joined by their foreign ministers before moving into the official negotiating room. Hopes for a breakthrough appear slim and would depend on Ukraine making most of the concessions, with advancing rebels unlikely to agree to halt and go back to previous positions. Still, Moscow expressed optimism. A Russian diplomatic source said it was 70 per cent likely that an agreement would be reached. The Russian, French, German and Ukranian leaders shared an awkward tea party meeting before the talks . Angela Merkel makes a point to Putin before the leaders sat down for an opening meeting before the summit . 'The presidents aren't travelling [to Minsk] for no reason,' the source said. But even as he spoke pro-Moscow separatists tightened the pressure on Kiev by launching some of the war's worst fighting. The Kiev army said 19 of its soldiers were killed in a day of pro-Russian separatist assaults near the railway town of Debaltseve, some of the worst losses it has reported in nine months of war. Rebels who tore up a five-month-old truce in January are trying to encircle government forces in Debaltseve, a strategic location that would let them link up their main strongholds. Fighting has already killed more than 5,000 people, and Washington is now openly talking of arming Ukraine to defend itself from 'Russian aggression', raising the prospect of a proxy war in the heart of Europe between Cold War foes. A surge in fighting in the 24 hours before the summit, including a rocket attack that killed 17 people deep in government-held territory on Tuesday, could be intended to force Ukraine to accept a deal recognising the rebel advance. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said there had been progress in the run-up to the Minsk summit but Kiev could be holding back a deal by insisting on control of the Russian-Ukrainian border, part of which is held by the separatists. The talks are taking place while an International Monetary Fund mission is trying to negotiate a bailout to save Ukraine from bankruptcy brought on by corruption and mismanagement as well as war. Left to right: Lukashenko, Putin, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Hollande and Poroshenko pose for a noticeably wooden photo opportunity during the peace talks . The leaders met in an attempt to resolve the escalating crisis in eastern Ukraine, which saw 19 more soldiers killed today, according to the Ukranian army . President Putin gestures as Angela Merkel and  Petro Poroshenko prepare to take their seats for the meeting . Prime Minister Arseny Yatseniuk said he hoped for a loan deal within days. Kiev and NATO accuse Russia of supplying separatists with men and weapons. Moscow denies it is involved in fighting for territory Putin calls 'New Russia'. If the French and German leaders were hoping their peace initiative would be met by conciliatory moves on the ground, the prospect of talks appears to have triggered the opposite, with the pro-Russian rebels determined to drive home their advantage. Armoured columns of Russian-speaking soldiers with no insignia have been advancing for days around Debaltseve. Last week they captured the small town of Vuhlehirsk next to Debaltseve, and a reconnaissance unit was there on Tuesday salvaging equipment from abandoned Ukrainian trenches. The squad's commander said his men did not want a truce while they had government forces on the run. On the Russian side of the border, Moscow announced war games on Tuesday on the eve of the talks.

Vladimir Putin arrives in Minsk for the summit. He has referred to eastern Ukraine as 'New Russia' The United States has been openly discussing arming the Ukrainian government, a move that is opposed by European allies who say it would escalate the conflict while falling far short of giving Kiev the firepower needed to win. President Barack Obama says he has yet to make up his mind on the question of sending weapons. He spoke by phone overnight to Putin, and the White House said he warned the Russian leader that the costs would rise if Moscow kept aiding the separatists. A decision by the West to provide arms to Ukraine could prompt a rapid escalation of Russian support for the separatists, the International Institute for Strategic Studies, a global security think tank, said on Wednesday. Kiev military spokesman Vladyslav Seleznyov, briefing journalists on rebel attempts to encircle government forces holding Debaltseve, said the 19 soldiers had been killed 'in shelling, rocket attacks and military clashes'. In separatist-held territory, rebel authorities said six people were killed and eight seriously hurt when a shell hit a bus station in the city of Donetsk, eastern Ukraine. Reuters journalists saw the body of a man behind the wheel of a minibus after the shell fell through the roof of the station, burning up the vehicle and another beside it.","Vladimir Putin looks smug while Petro Poroshenko glares across at him .

"Think you can’t have lunch for under a fiver? We’re here to tell you that you can. But it will mean changing some lunchtime habits. You will need to steer clear of popular options such as Pret, Whole Foods, Eat and Crussh and start going to supermarkets for your sarnie, salad and snack. And while an Asda sandwich or a Tesco salad might not be the most glamorous of lunches, you could end up saving between £2 to £5 a day, depending on your food choices. While they may have some enticing options salad bars and hot lunch counters can often ending costing a lot . While we all love hearty office lunch, the cost of a daily takeaway can be crippling . While we all love hearty office lunch, the cost of a daily takeaway can be crippling. The combined cost of a sandwich, drink and a snack from popular lunchtime outlets can often come up to more than £6 a day. For instance a Pret a Manger lunch of a chicken and avocado sandwich (£3.25) with a bottle of pomegranate and hibiscus still water (£1.65) and a slice of banana cake (£1.60) comes up to £6.50, which when multiplied by five (assuming you work Monday to Friday) will cost you a whopping £32.50 a working week. Compare that to the cost of an M&S lunch  of a chicken, chilli and mango salsa sandwich with coconut pieces and orange juice, which comes up to £5, or £25 per working week and the price disparity is obvious. And while you're losing the pounds from your purse, you may well be piling them elsewhere as a lot of these options are high calorie foods. Pret's 482-calorie sandwich also loses out when pitted against M&S's, which contains a mere 295 calories. Marks & Spencer's £5 a day lunch includes a sandwich, coconut pieces and freshly squeezed orange juice . Bargain: Asda's chicken and wholewheat pasta, savoury popcorn and cranberry drink costs just £3.69 . Hot food counters like the ones at Whole Foods Market are also guilty of making us overspend. The pay-by-the pound pricing structure can be misleading and there are times when you can end up paying as much as £20 or a salad or hot lunch just because you weren't paying attention to what you were putting in your takeaway bowl. Supermarkets may not have the most exotic of choices but their prices are far more appealing. The M&S Piri Piri Chicken and Coleslaw Sandwich costs just £2.50. Bored of sandwiches? Splash out an extra 50p and go for the Tikka Chicken & Rice Salad. Snacks include the 50p Sour Cream & Chilli Lentil Curls, Reduced Fat Hummus and Carrot, and Cracking Coconut, both £1 or the £1.20 fruit selection of melon, pineapple and grapes. Add a bottle of Orange Juice (£1.50) or Revitalise Sparkling Apple & Blueberry (£1) and your meal will cost you exactly £5. Looking to make bigger lunchtime saving? Try Asda’s super salads. Lunch on either Baby Potato and Free Range Egg Salad, (153cal); Spiced Chicken and Wholewheat Pasta (305cal) or Spiced Chicken and Mango Salad (164cal), all from their Good and Balanced range and you won’t be spending any more than £2. And as you’ve only spent £2 on salad, you can afford a snack of either walnuts and dates, crinkle cut crisps, popcorn or lentil chips, all which cost £1. Add a drink (69p) and you’ll still be hard pushed to spend more than £4 here. Tesco's £3 meal deal options include tuna and cucumber sandwiches on malted bread (left) and the 2 for £2 sushi combinations such as their veggie taster (right) Have Asda's baby potato and free range egg salad (left)  for lunch and snack on lentil chips as a treat (right) Tesco is another great option.

"A mother says she returned home from the school run to find a gaping hole in her new extension after the new £14,000 windows had been removed and 'held hostage' by fitters in a row over payment. Phoebe Oliver, 40, says she and her husband James had paid for the floor to ceiling windows to be installed in the annex of their home in Brighton, east Sussex. But when the mother-of-three returned home from taking their children to school last week she was shocked to find they had vanished, and there was a gaping hole where the windows had been. Phoebe Oliver (pictured) returned home from the school run to find a gaping hole in her new extension after the £14,000 windows had been removed and 'held hostage' by fitters in a row over payment. She has written this message on the windows herself - police say no crime has been committed and it is a civil matter . Mrs Oliver, who runs a PR firm and is also a fitness coach, had paid in full for the windows in November, but the bi-fold doors were later removed by the company which had installed them as part of a dispute between the firm and two other companies. Now the windows are being 'held hostage' at the warehouse of  window and door specialist Sussex Bifold Doors, which says it will hold them until the firm has been paid by the other companies involved. 'This is just unbelievable,' she said. 'I took the kids on the school run and came home to find my windows had vanished. On a freezing cold winter day. 'And I have done absolutely nothing wrong. The bill for the windows was settled months ago when I paid the builders doing the job. The argument here is between a load of builders who I don't even know. Sussex Bifold Doors installed the windows, and says it will not return them until the firm is paid. Mrs Oliver has written this message on the board herself. The police have made it clear that no crime was committed, and the dispute over the windows is a civil matter . Fitness coach Mrs Oliver, who also runs a PR firm, had wanted to use the new annex as a gym . 'Yet they thought they had the right to simply turn up unannounced while I was out and, for want of better word, steal my new bi-fold windows. It is outrageous. 'I was left looking at nothing but fresh air where the windows should have been. I was only out of the house for a couple of hours at most.' Mrs Oliver, who planed to use the annex as a gym area for her fitness coaching, paid for the windows to be installed at her £730,000 four-bedroom home with inheritance money she was left by her father. 'What makes this worse is the fact I used the money my dear father left me for the work when he died,' she said. 'I felt an emotional attachment to the improvements I was making anyway and this has been a terrible way to treat someone who had paid in full. 'I feel like these people trespassed on my property without my permission and its an awful feeling, like they have violated my property and my family. I have three kids, two under 11 years of age, and I feel very vulnerable now.' Mrs Oliver says she paid in full for the work three months ago. She hired a building firm, who in turn hired another company to source the windows from Sussex Bifold Doors, which installed them . Mr Oliver visited the Sussex Bifold Doors warehouse in nearby Lancing to try and get the windows returned but was told by company staff they were holding them until the dispute was concluded. A scuffle ensued which led to Mr Oliver being arrested and ordered to pay a £90 fine. He also accidentally broke his foot in the incident and spent the night in hospital. Mrs Oliver has contacted Sussex Police who said it was a civil matter. She has also contacted lawyers over legal action to get her windows back. Now the annexe has been boarded up as Mrs Oliver tried to recover her windows. A spokesman for Sussex Bifold Doors said it would be keeping the windows until paid in full by the builders involved. Brighton-based builders Armstrong White, who were paid by Mrs Oliver, claim they paid a Brighton sub-contractor D and L Property Maintenance to source the windows from Sussex Bifold Doors. Lee Clowes, director of D and L, said: 'I am caught in the middle of an akward situation and the windows are really nothing to do with me.' He said he had not been paid by Armstrong White. Armstrong White have since returned to the house to secure the building. Mrs Oliver added: 'How can it be right for someone just to turn up and take what I have paid for while I am out taking my kids to school. 'It is just a disgraceful state of affairs. I think they thought they were dealing with a woman who would be intimidated. I am deeply upset by this but I won't let them get away with it.'","Phoebe Oliver paid building firm, who hired sub-contractor for windows .

"Tilfert D. Vaughn (pictured) is accused of breaking into the home of a woman and raping her at knifepoint while her partner lay next to them . A man has been accused of breaking into the apartment of a woman he met in a bar and raping her at knifepoint while her terrified partner lay next to them in the bed. Tilfert Darrell Vaughn, 54, of Phoenix, Arizona was arrested on Sunday following the alleged incident. Police say Vaughn broke into the couple's apartment and sexually assaulted the 27-year-old woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, while holding a large knife to her throat after spotting her earlier that evening in a bar. Phoenix police say the alleged incident took place on November 5 in the apartment the woman shared with her partner. Court records show the woman's 30-year-old girlfriend woke up when Vaughn allegedly got in to the bed and was injured when her hand and fingers came into contact with Vaughn's knife. She required 'extensive surgery' according to AZ Central. Both women told police that they feared Vaughn would kill them if they did not do as he said. Court papers show the victim told investigators that following the rape Vaughn told her: 'You now have a baby. Bless it and take care of it.' The woman told police she woke up and saw the suspect standing naked inside her bathroom holding a knife. She claims Vaughn then ordered her to lie on the bed and he proceeded to sexually assault her. The alleged victim said he told her not to look at him as he went to the bathroom before he dressed and left. Police say Vaughn's DNA matched physical evidence taken from the woman's forensic exam. Vaughn denies going to the victim's apartment and denies raping her. He is facing charges of rape, sexual assault, aggravated assault, aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, kidnapping and burglary. Investigators also believe that Vaughn took several items from the couple's apartment, including sunglasses, toiletries, beer and food, according to AZ Central. Vaughn is set to attend a preliminary hearing next week.

"Lined up on the quayside of an Italian port yesterday, these hearses are a chilling reminder of the risks migrants are prepared to take to reach Europe. At least 300 are feared to have drowned as they tried to cross the Mediterranean from Libya in rubber dinghies. The nine who survived, thought to be West African, told how many drowned as at least two of four dinghies that set out for Italy sank in 30ft waves. Scroll down for video . Grim task: The scene in Lampedusa harbour yesterday as hearses queued to collect victims' corpses . Tragedy: The hearses wait as the bodies of migrants are unloaded from a ship in Lampedusa harbour . Tragic: Hearses wait in Lampedusa's harbour in expectation of hundreds of victims to wash ashore . Sad: People carry a coffin of a migrant who died in the shipwreck at Lampedusa airport this afternoon . RIP: A coffin containing the body of a victim of the disaster is seen being removed from Lampedusa harbour . Other migrants, including children, were swept overboard after being packed 100 to a boat in craft meant to hold just 20, or froze to death during a four-day ordeal without food or water. A further 29 died from hypothermia as they clung to the deck of a rescue boat during the journey to shore on the island of Lampedusa. Those rescued said each passenger had paid people smugglers £500 for the crossing. Some had been concerned about the rough seas and had not wanted to make the trip but were forced into the boats at gunpoint. UNHCR Europe director Vincent Cochetel warned: 'This is a tragedy on an enormous scale and a stark reminder that more lives could be lost if those seeking safety are left at the mercy of the sea.' The tragedy turned the spotlight on the EU decision to withdraw rescue and patrol boats that had saved tens of thousands of lives. The operation, which was costing £7million a month, ended after Britain and other states complained it was helping attract more migrants and refused to contribute. Resting place: Hearses drive off the boat from Lampedusa to Porto Empedocle, where the dead will be buried . Heavy price: Those rescued said each passenger had paid people smugglers £500 for the crossing . Mourning: A man lays flowers on the coffins, packed one atop the other as they await burial in Sicily . The savage sea: Hearses wait by the quayside in Porto Empedocle with the coffins of the dead migrants . No choice: A policeman stands by the hearses. Survivors of the crossing said some victims had been afraid of the rough seas and had not wanted to make the trip, but they were forced into the boats at gunpoint . Could they have been saved? The tragedy turned the spotlight on the EU decision to withdraw rescue and patrol boats that had saved tens of thousands of lives after Britain and other states refused to contribute . The spokeswoman for the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, Carlotta Sami, says the nine survivors have confirmed the existence of a fourth rubber boat that left Libya on Sunday. The agency's spokeswoman in Italy, Carlotta Sami, had said the victims had been 'swallowed up by the waves,' the youngest of them aged just 12-years-old. In an incident apparently related to yet another boat full of migrants, the Italian coast guard picked up 105 people on Sunday in extremely dangerous sea conditions near to Libya and with the temperature hovering just a few degrees above zero. 29 people from that dinghy died of hypothermia in the 18 hours it took the coast guard to ferry them to Italy. UNHCR blasted the new EU-backed rescue patrol as ineffective for saving lives. The European Union took over Mediterranean patrols after Italy phased out its robust Mare Nostrum operation, launched after 360 migrants died in 2013. But the EU's Triton mission only operates a few miles off Italy's coast, whereas Mare Nostrum patrols took Italian rescue ships up close to Libya's coast, where most of the smuggling operations originate. 'The Triton operation doesn't have as its principal mandate saving human lives, and thus cannot be the response that is urgently needed,' Laurens Jolles, the head of the U.N. agency for southern Europe, said in a statement.

"An argument between two women descended into a violent brawl of hair pulling and punching after a customer headbutted a tax worker in Walmart. Jessica Albitz claims Alice Keener, who works at a Jackson Hewitt stall within the store in La Porte, Texas, was rude to her and her husband the day before the fight broke out, when the couple came into the store to get their taxes prepared. The next day, the two women got into another argument when Albitz returned to the store and that's when things turned violent. Video footage of the brawl shows Keener react by slamming Albitz's head onto a table five times before dragging her to the floor by her hair as the two women continued to attack each other and shout. Scroll down for video . Customer Jessica Albitz headbutted tax worker Alice Keener as a row descended into violence . They eventually had to be pulled apart by a male customer. Keener, who is larger than the slight Albitz, was later seen picking up pulled out strands of her hair from the floor. After they were separated she can be heard to shout on the video: 'You better get her. 'She come in messing with me. I'm at work.' Albitz later told Click 2 Houston that she doesn't regret the fight. 'I hope I broke her nose. I hope she has two black eyes and I hope she remembers me for the rest of her life,' she said. Albitz said her and her husband had encountered Keener the evening before at a Jackson Hewitt kiosk and she was very rude to them both, allegedly 'talking trash' to Albitz's husband. She told NBC: 'She came in in a bad mood and took it out on us.' When she returned the next day the pair started to argue when Albitz said she heard Kenner whisper an insult under her breath, as she passed the kiosk. Albitz says she confronted Kenner, who then chased her to the front of the Walmart, got 'right up in my face' and spat at her. 'She spit in my face, calling my mother a (expletive). I'm sorry. I love my family and I'm going to take up for my people,' Albitz said. Albitz claimed Kenner began hurling insults at her in the Walmart store and she decided to headbutt her .

A man had to separate the brawling women and helped Albitz to her feet from the supermarket floor . She said she was left with a large bruise on her arm and marks on her forehead after the violent fight. Neither of the women were charged with a crime after the violent brawl but Kenner has been put on 'administrative leave.' After the incident Jackson Hewitt issued a statement which said: 'We do not tolerate harassment, discrimination or violence in any capacity. 'The tax preparer has been placed on administrative leave as we investigate this matter.' She is also at risk of losing the full-time job she has held with the city of La Porte for the past 15 years. Her employer said  he was shocked by the video, and that they are now investigating whether she violated the city's code of conduct. Meanwhile, Albitz has been banned from entering the Walmart where the fight happened ever again. 'I was willing to take the charges,' Albitz said. 'If I were to have charges taken, I would've accepted that.

"The man who allegedly led police on a wild chase through the streets of LA and carjacked a woman at gunpoint is said to be a known gang member. Aaron Lorta was shot and wounded by officers after the high speed pursuit that was caught on camera. The 29-year-old was arrested after undergoing surgery and was said to be in a stable condition in hospital. Police said Lorta could face a number of charges, including carjacking. Court records show the suspect has a long criminal history, including convictions for battery, assault with a deadly weapon, grand theft auto, and attempted robbery, KNBC-TV reported. Lorta was held on $100,000 bail. It wasn't immediately known if he has a lawyer. Aaron Lorta, 29, has been arrested on suspicion of carjacking after the high speed chase through the streets of LA . Unbelievable: A shocking car chase unfolded in Los Angeles on Monday that saw a driver zoom through red lights at a massive city intersection--and that was just the start of a pursuit that lasted some 40 minutes across miles . Reckless: The car was reported as stolen before the driver took police on the unforgettable chase across much of Los Angeles. Here, the driver speeds recklessly onto a median after weaving through traffic going the wrong way . In pursuit: After clipping several cars and nearly smashing into others, the car barreled down a turning lane as helicopters buzzed overhead and the police were hot on his tail . Turn for the worse: The car soon dangerously hooks a left through oncoming traffic . Spinning out of control: While the driver manages to cut through oncoming traffic with no problem, he sounds finds himself spinning out of control . Worsening: The car soon clips a white truck at right and then barrels uncontrollably toward the white car at top . Fight or flight? The driver soon smashes into the white car and finds himself at a standstill and with a decision to make . Flight: The driver leaps from the car and takes off on foot along a Los Angeles roadway . Armed: The man approaches a car with what appears to be a gun and opens the door . Carjacking: The driver of the car flees as the man gets in and drives off once more . Chase continues: With the first car still visible in the picture, the driver peels out as at least eight squad cars follow after him . Stuck: As the sun set over Los Angeles, the car found itself wedged between two other cars and unable to move further . The chase began at around 5pm on Monday after officers answered a report of a possible stolen car in Boyle Heights, east of downtown Los Angeles,  police said. Footage shows the vehicle travelling at between 50 and 60mph on city streets as it ignores stop lights, races through intersections and weaves through traffic. The Toyota Camry sped through South Gate and other cities southeast of Los Angeles. It hit at least four cars at least four times before the driver lost control and it careered into a vehicle near an intersection. The man, wearing a white T-shirt, jumped out and tried to steal another car as television news helicopters hovered overhead. The driver then pulled out what appeared to be a gun, stole the second car from a Elizabeth Yarahuan, 22. 'He just came up to me and pointed the gun at me and told me to get out of my car,' Elizabeth Yarahuan, 22, told KABC-TV as she tried to fight back tears. 'I unbuckled myself, and I opened the door and ran out. It was horrible. I don't wish that on nobody.' Car theft attempt 3: The suspect tried and failed to carjack a third car, the SUV pictured here . Runs for it: The driver bolts though a busy roadway after unsuccessfully trying to jack the SUV . Theft attempt 4: The suspect tries to steal a car yet again as he flees police on foot . Taken down: The suspect is finally taken down in the street, apparently by a police bullet . The police swarmed the suspect before he was eventually hauled away in an ambulance suffering from unknown injuries . He raced along Interstate 710 and state Route 60 with at least eight patrol cars in pursuit. The car veered onto an off-ramp and then a Montebello street, where it became wedged between two other vehicles in traffic. The man jumped out and pulled open a door on a stopped SUV as police chased him. He tried to stop another car, but it took off before officers opened fire. No officers were hurt. Driver Martha Duron said she was fine after her car was sideswiped, but it could easily have been different. 'If he would've hit me hard, in the front, I would've been gone,' she told KCAL-TV. 'He was going so fast.' Police opened fire as the man appeared to be trying to steal another car.","Aaron Lorta, 29, arrested in hospital after police chase through LA .

"One of the consequences of living in our universe - where space and time are linked - is that as you travel faster, time can appear to speed up. This theory, known as time dilation, was first postulated by Albert Einstein in the early 20th century, and has since been proven in a number of experiments. But, considering that Earth is moving through space, does that mean time for us is travelling faster than someone who is stationary? The answer is 'yes', and by about one second per week. But why? A US physicist answered a question regarding time dilation on Earth (satellite image shown). They said our motion around the sun and galaxy causes time to slow. And even on the planet, the spin of Earth changes time for people. Shown is an image of Earth taken by Nasa's Suomi NPP satellite in 2012 . This question was posed on the website Ask a Mathematician, and answered by their resident expert known as ‘The Physicist’. The ‘twin paradox’ is a thought experiment proposed by Albert Einstein in the early 20th Century. It is derived from his theory of special relativity. Einstein suggests that the faster you travel, the slower you move through time. If one twin travelled in a spaceship near the speed of light, they would return home considerably younger than their sibling under laws of special relativity. Known as ‘time dilation,’ this was proven in 1971 with the Hafele-Keating experiment. Atomic clocks were set to the same time and then sent in different directions around the world in separate planes. The clocks were found to have ticked differently, proving special relativity. The expert says that the spin of Earth, its orbit around the sun and the solar system’s motion around the Milky Way all combine to decrease the time we experience on Earth. This is compared to someone who was stationary as compared to moving at our planet’s speed. On Earth itself, the effects of the planet’s spin on time are not too extreme - although they can be calculated. At the poles on Earth’s rotation axis, there is no velocity from the spin of the planet - but at the equator, it’s about 0.3 miles (0.5km) per second. ‘The difference in time experienced between people living in Longyearbyen (near the pole) and people living in Ecuador (near the equator) is about one part in a trillion,’ explained The Physicist. This ‘gives those proud Norwegians an extra second every 25 thousand years,’ they added. ‘Don’t spend that second all in one place, Norwegians.’ Around the sun, Earth is moving about 18.5 miles (30km) per second, which causes us to lose even more time that we would experience compared to someone moving slower. Earth's motion around the sun, as it orbits within the solar system (illustration shown) is about 18.5 miles (30km) per second, which causes us to lose even more time compared to someone who is stationary . Our motion around the galaxy, meanwhile, which is about 125 miles (200km) per second, equates to a gain in time of about one part in every 4.5 million, which is an extra second every couple of months. And just being in the Milky Way itself, which is travelling through space, also adds some extra time to our everyday life. By being in the galaxy and spinning around its centre, we lose roughly a second every week over someone who was floating out in intergalactic space. In an email The Physicist, who remains anonymous, told MailOnline  added that gravitational time dilation also had an effect, caused by the presence of gravity. It should be noted, though, that time is relative and there is no one true clock for the universe. This means that no one experiences the 'correct' time, but each person merely has their own frame of reference to space-time. The biggest effect on the time we experience is the motion around the galaxy, which is about 125 miles (200km) per second, and the movement of the Milky Way itself (shown from Earth). With everything combined, we gain approximately an extra second every week, compared to someone who is stationary in the universe .","A US physicist answered a question regarding time dilation on Earth .

"At 15-years-old, most people's biggest worry is what they will wear to the school disco. But by this age Ruth Pearcey had been battling bone cancer for years - and was now faced with a decision about whether to have her leg amputated in order to beat the disease. The now 21-year-old was diagnosed with bone cancer when she was 12, and had already beaten the disease once. When it came back a second time, she was told she only had a five per cent chance of survival if she kept her leg. She chose to make a huge sacrifice, and have an above the knee leg amputation in order to save her life. Ten years later, she says the gamble paid off as she is finally cancer free and enjoying life. Ruth Pearcey, 21, decided to have her leg amputated when she was 15, after doctors said without it she only had a five per cent chance of surviving bone cancer. She is pictured, left, with her prosthetic leg, and right, at her brother's wedding, before her leg was removed . Ms Pearcey had battled bone cancer since she was 12. In 2008, her kidneys failed due to intensive cancer treatment (she is pictured during chemotherapy), and doctors said she had just 24 hours to live. Luckily she was able to recover - and attended her brother's wedding days later . Now, ten years later, Ms Pearcey said having her leg removed was the right choice. She said: 'Thankfully the amputation prevented the cancer from returning and I have finally been able to move on with my life' She is now sharing her story to raise awareness for Ewing's sarcoma, the rare form of bone cancer she suffered. Ms Pearcey, from Leeds, said: 'I was given the ultimate sacrifice, lose your leg or your life. 'It was heart-breaking at 15-years-old to have to make such a life-changing decision but I wasn't ready to die. 'Losing my leg would increase my chances of survival and I was willing to try anything to survive. 'Thankfully the amputation prevented the cancer from returning and I have finally been able to move on with my life.' Ms Pearcey first noticed a lump on her leg at the age of 12, it was painful and caused her to limp. She said: 'I enjoyed playing football but the pain was unbearable. 'My parents took me to the doctors and they thought it was an infection so I was prescribed with antibiotics but the lump didn't budge. 'It took three visits to our GP before I was given a life-saving X-ray and that was only because my mum had asked for one. 'I was diagnosed with aggressive bone cancer after having a biopsy of my tumour. Last year Ms Pearcey was finally given the 'all clear', after being in remission for five years . It was first discovered Ms Pearcey had cancer when she began to limp, and found playing football painful. She endured gruelling chemotherapy and surgery throughout her teenage years . She underwent rounds of gruelling chemotherapy as well as surgery to remove the tumour on her leg. She was in remission for just under two years when the lump on her leg reappeared. 'I knew straight away that my cancer was back, I was petrified,' Ms Pearcey said. 'I was older this time around and I knew the seriousness of my condition, I was also devastated about the thought of losing my hair again.' In June 2008, Ruth was given just 24-hours to live after her kidneys began to fail due to invasive cancer treatment. Luckily she survived and was able to attend her brother's wedding just days later – when hospital staff allowed her out for the day. She said: 'I was on dialysis after my kidneys failed but I beat the odds and my kidneys recovered. 'I was faced with an amputation a few months later and that was the scariest part of my cancer journey.' Doctors told Ruth that without having her leg amputated that she would have just five per cent chance of beating cancer. She needed to have her leg amputated to improve her chances of making a full recovery. Ms Pearcey added: 'My supportive friends and family helped me make the decision, I needed my leg removed. Ms Pearcey had to learn to walk again with a prosthetic leg. But she can now look forward to the future without worrying about cancer, she says . 'When I woke up from my operation I was worried about the future but losing my leg gave me my life back. 'I was finally given the all clear last year after five years in remission. 'I can now look forward to the future without worrying about cancer every day.' Ms Pearcey has been supported throughout her cancer journey by the Bone Cancer Research Trust and The Teenage Cancer Trust. Julie Harrington, chief executive of the Bone Cancer Research Trust, said: 'Ruth is an absolute star and has shown nothing but incredible bravery, strength and positivity since her diagnosis. 'She has overcome the odds with dignity and courage and her story will no doubt inspire others who are battling cancer. 'Primary bone cancer is brutal disease which affects 600 people in the UK and Ireland every year. 'Only half of these will survive and those who do are left with long-lasting physical and emotional scars. 'It is the third biggest cancer killer in young adults and children and it is only through research and awareness that we can change these devastating statistics to help people like Ruth - now and in the future.'

"Furious MPs have accused Britain’s tax authorities of 'failing' the public by letting thousands of people stash their cash in Swiss bank accounts. The Chair of the House of Commons Public Accounts Committee Margaret Hodge said she was furious at the 'pathetic' response to leaked HSBC files which showed thousands of British-linked individuals held bank accounts in Switzerland. It came after revelations HM Revenue and Customs received a list of 6,800 HSBC customers with Swiss bank accounts five years ago – but had only managed to prosecute one person, despite £135million in owed tax being recovered. Scroll down for video . Margaret Hodge said she was furious at the 'pathetic' response to leaked HSBC files showing thousands of British-linked individuals held bank accounts in Switzerland . Mrs Hodge said HMRC had failed to serve British taxpayers' interests in their response to the leak in 2010. David Cameron was earlier accused of being 'up to his neck' in the Swiss bank account scandal after it emerged that a string of the individuals with Swiss accounts were Tory donors. In a fiery Commons debate, the Prime Minister insisted 'no-one had done more' than the current government to crack down on tax avoidance. But Mr Miliband said the PM was 'bang to rights', adding: 'He can't get away from it – he's a dodgy Prime Minister, surrounded by dodgy donors.' Mrs Hodge meanwhile laid the blame at the door of the tax authorities for failing to act on the leaked list of Swiss bank account owners. She said the activities related to the Geneva branch of HSBC's Swiss subsidiary were 'pretty outrageous'. HMRC chief Lin Homer defended her record prosecuting tax dodgers . HMRC was offered a copy of a disk detailing HSBC clients who had potentially avoided tax seven years ago – but ignored it. Mrs Hodge told HMRC chief Lin Homer that taxmen should have spoken to whistleblower Herve Falciani, who initially obtained the list while employed as an IT worker in 2007. Ms Homer insisted that HMRC staff had been 'diligent' in their approach to the files, and said their record of securing one conviction and £135 million in unpaid tax, fines and interest compared well with other countries. But Mrs Hodge told her that the French tax authorities had recouped £200 million from 3,000 names and the Spanish £180 million from 2,900. And she told the HMRC chief: 'It's pretty outrageous what was going on. 'It's the first time in many of these leaks that there are really strong allegations not of egregious tax avoidance, but of tax evasion, and that is incredibly serious. 'For you to sit there and say, as you are doing, that ‘We couldn't get the money in in the same way as the French and Spanish did’ and ‘We didn't litigate because we wanted to get the money in’ and yet you did worse on the money - it leaves me believing that you are not serving the British taxpayer.' She added: 'The worst that can happen to you, if HMRC can be bothered to catch up with you, is that you may have to pay, you won’t have a prosecution, you won’t have any shame, you won’t be an example to anybody else, you will get away with it. 'That’s a terrible message to give out to British taxpayers.' Responding to Ms Hodge's comments, Ms Homer insisted ‘that is absolutely not the case' and denied the agency had a 'soft' approach to tax avoidance. Some 300 staff, led by three directors, had been sifting through the data supplied by French authorities in 2010 and had traced 3,200 individuals, including 150 ‘most serious’ cases which could be considered for criminal prosecution, 500 which were ‘more serious’ but not likely to meet the criminal threshold and 400-500 which could be pursued for disclosure and settlement. Tory MP Stephen Phillips said the decision to prosecute just one person sent out the message that there was little risk in dodging tax. Ms Homer, who was branded ‘Ms Incompetence’ over her record at the UK Border Agency, said prosecutions were expensive and needed stronger evidence. She also insisted the agency’s poster campaigns were effective in reducing tax avoidance. Ed Miliband today accused David Cameron  of being 'up to his neck' in the Swiss bank account scandal . But the Prime Minister said no government had done more to tackle tax avoidance since coming to power . Ms Homer, who was appointed to lead HMRC in 2012, said she believed the authority would have told Government ministers about the data within months of receiving it. ‘We are confident we will have told ministers that we were about to receive a big tranche of operational information,’ she said. ‘We will have told people, including ministers, I suspect some time in the next few months.’ HMRC had previously told the committee that it hoped to bring about 15 cases to prosecution, but in the event three were passed on to the Crown Prosecution Service, which decided to take just one to court. HMRC officials are meeting with other agencies later this week to discuss a new investigation, the committee heard. This is thought to include the Serious Fraud Office and the police.","Public Accounts Committee chair says HMRC  'failing' British taxpayers .

The little girl died of her injuries - his wife and son are in a critical condition . Addison (pictured as a baby) was pronounced dead at the hospital - her brother remains in a critical condition . The station also reported that the married couple were estranged. Both Addison and her brother were flown to Kosair Children's Hospital in Louisville, Kentucky. Addison was pronounced dead  upon arrival at the hospital and her brother is believed to be in a critical condition. Randolph was airlifted to the University of Louisville Hospital but was later transferred to Kosair to be with her children. Her condition is currently unknown. Indiana State Police, local sheriffs and the Paoli Police Department are investigating the killings. A neighbor, who did not want to be named, told WLKY: 'The kids, they are just the sweetest things, they didn't deserve this at all.'

"An Iranian actress - already exiled from the country for exposing her breasts in a 2012 photo shoot - has caused another uproar after posing naked in French magazine, Egoiste. A stylish black-and-white picture of Golshifteh Farahani taken by world-renowned photographer Paolo Roversi features on the front cover. It shows the 31-year-old staring sultrily into the camera, body slightly twisted to reveal her completely uncovered form. Farahani was exiled from Iran in 2012 for revealing her right breast in a promotional video with other actors to promote Cesars - the French equivalent of the Academy Awards. Scroll down for video . Exile: Golshifteh Farahani, who has caused an uproar by posing naked in a French magazine, has not been able to return to Iran since 2012 (pictured) when she exposed her right breast in promotional video . Controversy: The 31-year-old actress (pictured at the premier of 'Exodus: Gods and Kings' features completely naked on the front cover of French magazine Egoiste . Authorities phoned her family in Tehran to say she would be 'punished, that her breasts would be cut off and presented [to her father] on a plate', Middle East news site Al-Arabiya reported at the time. She now lives in Paris with her husband but this latest act of rebellion against her allegedly oppressive home country has raised questions about her safety. Fox News claims Farahani told the luxury publication: 'France has liberated me. [Paris] is the only place in the world where women do not feel guilty. 'In the East, you are that [guilty] all the time. As soon as you feel your first sexual impulses.' Farahani is considered Iran's most famous actress after being the first woman from the country to star in a Hollywood blockbuster film. She recently starred alongside Oscar winner Christian Bale in Ridley Scott's epic 'Exodus: Gods and Kings'. And she appeared in the hit 2008 film 'Body of Lies' with Russell Crowe and Leonardo DiCaprio. In the 2012 road-trip movie 'Just Like a Woman', she played a fugitive accused of her mother-in-law's death alongside Sienna Miller whose character had aspirations of winning a belly dancing competition. Iran has seen a rise in policies which infringe the 'most basic rights of Iranian women' since the current President took power in 2013, according to the International Campaign for Human Rights in Iran. But some argue that Farahani posing naked is not the best way to support the rights of Iranian women. Big screen: Farahani is considered Iran's most famous acting export after appearing in the 2008 film 'Body of Lies' (pictured) and more recently in Ridley Scott's epic 'Exodus: Gods and Kings' Unwelcome: The actress (pictured at the Venice Film Festival) now resides in Paris with her husband and claims that France has 'liberated her' Kamal Nawash from the Free Muslims Coalition said: 'In addition to degrading and objectifying women, posing naked may actually be counterproductive to supporting women's rights. 'Those opposing equality for women, will just point to the naked women and argue to the parents of the nation that it is their traditional values that prevent their daughters from being degraded and objectified as women.' The official Tehran-based news agency has described her as the 'hidden, disgusting face of cinema'. She was also condemned by Iran's Ministry of Culture for 'not wearing a headscarf' at the New York premiere of 'Body of Lies'. Censors banned the last film she made in the country - 'About Elly' - from being shown in the country. It was nominated for Best Foreign Language Film at the 82nd Academy Awards and eventually won the award for Best Narrative Feature at the Tribeca Film Festival. Farahani told the British newspaper The Telegraph that she was also informed by the Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guide official that the country 'does need any actors or artists' and that she should offer her 'artistic services somewhere else.' A representative for Farahani did not respond for further comment, and the Iranian government is yet to issue a response to her photo shoot.","Golshifteh Farahani, 31, modeled naked in luxury French magazine, Egoiste .

"Principals are struggling to deal with the students and parents who are falling under the sway of radical Islam, according to a group representing educators. The Australian Principals Federation has welcomed the Victorian government's move to introduce new measures to deal with the growing problem in schools. A state education spokesman said the department was working closer with police and had nominated staff in regional officers to work with Victoria Police counterparts 'to provide advice and support to schools'. The Australian Principals Federation says principals are having trouble dealing with the radicalisation of parents and students who may turn out like Abdullah Elmir . Numan Haider, 18, was another teenager who was suspected of terrorist activity before he was shot dead by police . It comes after one principal told Fairfax Media of his struggles to help two children whose parents have left Australia to Syria to fight with Islamic State in the Middle East at his state-run primary school. 'We have to work extra hard to ensure students don't take up their parents extreme beliefs,' he said. 'I have them singing the national anthem with the Australian flag and say what a lucky country they live in.' The school is made up of a lot of children from the Shiite, Alawite and Sunni Muslim communities. Since then, there had been a rise in suspensions of students as they fought at school. 'What's happening in the Middle East does impact here - the families are divided in their beliefs,' he said. Haider was shot dead after he stabbed two officers outside a police station in Melbourne . The Australian Principals Association branch president Peter Kearney told Daily Mail Australia 'several issues' about 'social cohesion' had been raised with the group by principals. 'One thing we see is that where there are tensions in the community then there are tensions in the school,' he said. Mr Kearney said radicalisation in students and children had been 'a battle for principals' but they were unsure about how to deal with it. 'What are the guidelines, where do you go? What do you do when children behaving extremely? It's quite complex for principals to make a decision without rules,' he said. 'Kids, for example, who come from different religious groups have different ways to wear uniform. Boys might like to have their ankles exposed deliberately. And [principals ask]: ""Is that is they way we like to wear our uniform?"" 'Parents like the fact that children show their strength, it's what their beliefs are, that is required for what they do for their religion. 'We might not thing its important but it's the start of all sorts of wedges.' The former principal's comments come after concerns grow for the vulnerability of teenagers being recruited by terror group Islamic State. Elmir - who is known as the Ginger Jihadi - has appeared in a number of terror group recruitment video since he made his way over to Syria . Abdullah Elmir - dubbed the Ginger Jihadi - who went missing from his western Sydney home has appeared in a number of recruitment video for the extremist organisation in Syria. Another teenager who was suspected of having ties to terrorism was Numan Haider who was shot dead by police last year after he stabbed two officers in Melbourne. But Mr Kearney stressed this behaviour was not isolated to one religion. 'Most of the stuff schools deals with, it's confronting because of the ability to recruit other kids,' he said. 'The culture of schools is always open to challenge. The last school I was principal of had 64 nationalities.' A Victorian Department of Education spokesman said education was key to ensure young people were not marginalised and 'embrace the values of respect, diversity and tolerance'. 'Schools, like other areas of the community, can be environments in which children and young people may become marginalised, or the victims of racial, cultural or religious intimidation or bullying,' he said. 'The department has strengthened its relationships with Victoria Police, and has nominated staff in regional offices to work with their counterparts in Victoria Police to provide advice and support to schools. 'The department has appointed one of its senior advisers to work with government and non-government schools on initiatives to promote racial and religious tolerance and social cohesion, and to identify how best the department can support these initiatives. 'The department's nominated staff in regional offices are always available to advise and support school principals who may have concerns about a student’s safety or well-being.'","Principals have raised issues about dealing with radicalism in schools .

"A couple who were terrorized by a woman after they outbid her on a 'dream home' have revealed the strain that the year-long ordeal put on their marriage. Jerry Rice, 40, and Janice Ruhter, 37, who have a young son and daughter, were targeted by 53-year-old Kathy J. Rowe after they bought a home in San Diego, California, in late 2011. Soon after they moved in, the couple had their mail stopped, $1,000 of magazine subscriptions delivered and Valentine's cards with Rice's name sent to other women on their quiet suburban street in Carmel Valley. Even more sinister, when Mr Rice searched his wife's name online, he discovered in horror that there were ads for sex parties at their home, entitled 'Carmel Valley Freak Show'. Mrs Rowe, pretending to be the couple, had advertised for men to visit the home while Rice was not there and force themselves upon Ruhter, claiming it was her fantasy to be raped. Scroll down for video . Janice Ruhter (pictured giving her victim impact statement in court last month) and her husband Jerry Rice (left) said that being tormented for a year by a stranger had a devastating impact on their marriage and sense of safety . Ruhter's photo and address were included in the posts which were made sometime between October 2011 and June 2012. 'I love to be surprised and have a man just show up at my door and force his way in the door and on me, totally taking me while I say no,' Rowe wrote to one man who responded, according to reports. Kathy Rowe, 53, tormented the young couple for a year after claiming she was left 'devastated' by missing out on her dream home . One man did show up at the couple's home but was thwarted once by a locked gate and a second time when the husband answered the door. The couple contacted the police who traced the emails to Rowe. Rice, a school teacher, and Ruhter, a hospital lab scientist, told People this week that the campaign of harassment badly damaged their marriage. Mr Rice began to neglect his family and became obsessed with watching online videos on how to install security lights and cameras. The couple now attend therapy sessions to rebuild their marriage. They both also spend two nights of the week practicing self-defense martial arts after the harassment destroyed their sense of safety in their own home. Ms Ruhter added: 'It was a huge stress in our life for so long. We are trying to heal the best way we can.' Rowe was sentenced last month to a year of electronic surveillance and five years of probation for terrorizing the young family. The 53-year-old, who was fired from her job as a county administrative analyst, was charged with  solicitation of rape and stalking charges in June 2012. The prosecutor said the charges were filed because Rowe's actions went far beyond a prank. In December, Rowe entered a plea bargain over the stalking charges, in exchange for prosecutors to drop felony charges of soliciting rape and sodomy and misdemeanor charges of identity theft and harassment. 'Dream home': Rowe told a California court last month that it was 'devastating' when she lost the home, pictured, due to a miscommunication with real estate agents in 2011 . Rowe said that she tormented the couple as revenge because the home (pictured) they outbid her for had been perfect for her sick husband and disabled daughter . Rowe posted ads online encouraging strange men to go to the home (pictured) and rape Ms Ruhter . A conviction for soliciting rape would have required Rowe to register for life as a sex offender. In court last month, Rowe apologized to the couple for what she had put them through. 'I just wanted to say how humiliated I am by my behavior – that this is not representative of who I am. I've never behaved like this – never will again,' she said. She said she acted due to the stress she was under and never intended to cause the couple any harm. Rice and Ruhter both made victim impact statements at her sentencing. 'The home should be a place of safety and sanctuary,' Ruhter said. 'But I never truly felt this way in our house. I felt most secure away from my home. The house became my prison.' Rice added: 'Had law enforcement not intervened in this case, I am certain Mrs. Rowe would have continued her attacks until she successfully brought physical harm to a member of my family.' In a letter to a judge last year, Rowe explained it had been 'devastating' when she lost the house due to miscommunication with real estate agents, and a more attractive bid from the other couple. She had her heart set on the home because it was a single story, to accommodate her severely disabled daughter, and had a pool, to provide exercise for her husband who has stage 4 stomach cancer. 'The anger and grief over losing that house (and especially in the way we did) drove me to behave in a very childish way and to do what I thought were childish pranks to let off steam and ease the pain,' Rowe said in January. 'I never intended for them to be hurtful.'","Jerry Rice, 40, and Janice Ruhter, 37, who have two young children, were targeted by Kathy Rowe after they bought a home in San Diego, California .

"This is the moment a £300,000 Lamborghini Aventador was seized by police because the owner had forgotten to pay his vehicle tax. The 217mph supercar was stopped by officers in West Bromwich, West Midlands, on Saturday night and database checks revealed the imported German car was not taxed for Britain’s roads. But the 35-year-old owner, who lives and works in the UK, had his car returned after paying a £260 fine. He was pulled over as part of Operation Jessica, a project being carried out by six UK forces. Seized: The 217mph Lamborghini was stopped by officers in West Bromwich, West Midlands, on Saturday . Black supercar: Database checks revealed the imported German car was not taxed for Britain’s roads . It gives police powers to order owners of foreign vehicles to tax, insure and register their cars in the UK or leave the country within 56 days. If they do not comply then their cars will be crushed. Detectives estimate that up to 350,000 foreign registered vehicles entered Britain and overstayed the six-month exemption period without registering and licensing between 2010 and 2013. The problem is said to cost the taxpayer £60million a year in lost tax revenue. West Midlands Police stated in November that 130 foreign vehicles had been seized in the first few weeks of its operation. Superintendent Paul Keasey, from the force, said: ‘The DVLA has provided us with a “hot list” of vehicles that have entered the country and stayed longer than permitted without licensing it here. Given back: The owner, aged 35, who lives and works in the UK, had his car returned after paying a £260 fine . ‘We are actively targeting these vehicles and making stops on other foreign cars to check they are complying. ‘It’s the responsibility of every driver, no matter where they come from, to ensure they obey the UK road laws and that includes falling in line with on taxation, registration and insurance, as well as those on safe driving. ‘This initiative allows us to deal more effectively with criminality on our roads, thereby increasing our communities’ safety and security.’ The Aventador can accelerate from 0 to 62mph  in 2.9 seconds and comes with a powerful 6.5-litre V12 engine. A Top Gear review described it as having 'bodywork that scares small children'. The 700bhp vehicle, which can achieve 17.6mpg, costs between £242,000 and £295,000 - which is about 1,000 times the value of the fine given to the driver in West Bromwich.","217mph supercar stopped by officers in West Bromwich, West Midlands .

Two more sketches show how the perfect nanny was to appear in the chalk painting 'Jolly Holiday' scenes, dressed in an Edwardian gown and bonnet and holding a parasol. The images were conception drawings for Mary Poppins for the big screen version of the PL Travers' children's books. They were the work of Mr Walton, who was the costume designer for the Walt Disney musical film and who was married to Julie Andrews at the time. The costume department used them to create the outfits worn by Andrews. Two of the sketches show how the perfect nanny was to appear in the chalk painting 'Jolly Holiday' scenes . A letter from Julie Andrews to Mrs Rames is also being auctioned off - it thanks her for a telegram she received in the wake of winning an Oscar for Best Actress for Mary Poppins . After the filming Neva Rames, a member the costume department, kept the drawings as a memento. They are now being sold at auction for $1,500 each. Also up for sale is a letter Andrews sent to Mrs Rames, thanking her for her telegram she received in the wake of winning an Oscar for Best Actress for Mary Poppins. Lucy Carr, from the entertainment department at auctioneers Bonhams, said: 'They are drawings of Mary Poppins in a couple of dress costumes; two of her in Jolly Holiday scene and one of her in traditional outfit for the chimney sequence. The images were conception drawings for the big screen version of the PL Travers' children's books . 'They were created during the production of the film. The owner, Neva Rames, worked in the costume department. 'Walt Disney bought the rights to the books in 1961 but not the illustrations and so he wasn't tied to what period the film was to be set. 'He changed the period to Edwardian London in 1910 because it was far more interesting costuming compared to the 1930s. 'These would have been informal drawings, conceptualising her appearance in the film . 'A lot of these sort of memorabilia was retained by Walt Disney and it is rare to see such items come up for sale.' The sale will take place in Los Angeles on March 1.

"A greedy crocodile has died from overeating after record numbers of worshippers started throwing goats and chickens into its pond in a bid to get good luck. For years, visitors had gone to the Hazrat Khan Jahan Ali Shrine in Sadar Upazila of Bagerhat district in south-western Bangladesh, in the belief that feeding the crocodile would guarantee them luck in troubled economic times. But priests at the shrine said that a large number of worshippers in recent months had been turning up and offering sacrifices to the crocodile, who had rapidly grown very fat from the offerings. Scroll down for video . Overweight: The 100-year-old croc was fed chickens and goats by worshippers who believed their sacrifices would get wishes granted . Crocked: A crocodile keeper fishes the giant reptile from a pond in the Bagerhat district in south-western Bangladesh. The 100-year-old was overweight after diet of goats and chickens . Crocodile keeper Mohammed Sarwar, 40, said: 'We were aware of the problem but were not sure what to do about it. The legend is that anybody who feeds the hunger of the crocodiles will have their hearts desire fulfilled. 'Usually it was just a chicken but more recently people have been offering even more, including goats, believing that big sacrifices meant more chance of a wish being granted.' According to local legend, the pond containing the crocodile had been dug by the Muslim saint Hazrat Khan Jahan Ali 600-years-ago. He used it to rear two crocodiles named Kalopahar and Dholapahar. Worshippers: The crocodile was fed chickens and goats by worshippers who believed their sacrifices would get wishes granted . Dead: The 100-year-old died after enjoying a diet of goats and chickens fed to him by worshippers. He was recovered from pond in Bagerhat district in south-western Bangladesh . Until recently, there were four crocodiles in the pond but the other three had also died from obesity related problems, leaving a massive food supply for the final remaining crocodile. When an offering was made, the crocodile was summoned by priests who would bang a gong and announce that dinner was served, prompting the crocodile minutes later to surface and eat the preferred offering. No more: The giant crocodile was the last of four in the pond, which legend said was blessed by a saint in the Bagerhat district in south-western Bangladesh . However when staff turned up for work one morning they discovered the crocodile floating upside down in the pond and realised it had died.

"Islamic State militants have launched an urgent appeal for people under their control to donate blood after suffering heavy casualties in Coalition air strikes, it was reported today. U.S. and partner nations conducted three air strikes in Syria and six in Iraq since Sunday which followed 56 bombing raids by Jordan in retaliation for the murder of its pilot. The attacks have reportedly killed dozens of jihadists and left many more seriously injured. In the terror group's de facto capital of Raqqa, fighters are understood to be calling for residents to give blood to treat their wounded comrades. Scroll down for video . Syrians donate blood during a campaign to supply  field hospitals in Aleppo in March last year. Islamic State militants have now launched their own urgent appeal for people under their control to donate blood after suffering heavy casualties in Coalition air strikes, it has been reported . Anti-ISIS activist group Raqqa Is Being Slaughtered Silently (RIBSS) claims people are being urged to donate regardless of their blood group such is the need to replenish stocks. It is not the first time ISIS has adopted such measures. Last month, a pregnant teenager who was captured by Islamic State militants has revealed how girls are being forced to give blood transfusions to keep their attackers alive. Hamshe told of how sickening Islamist jihadists have been using the blood of captured women and children for wounded fighters in the battlefield. The 19-year-old, who also has a baby with her husband who is believed to have been murdered by militants, was held captive for 28 days before she escaped. Sex slave: Hamshe, an Iraqi Yazidi girl, told last month how girls are being forced to give blood transfusions to keep their attackers alive . She said: 'When each of them took a Yazidi girl, one of them took me to his house and locked me inside a room and told me ""I will not give you food or water if you refuse to marry me"". 'They forced the Yazidi girls to donate blood to ISIS wounded fighters. Which God allows these acts?' In September, the militants also resorted to making appeals through loudspeakers at mosques after suffering mass injuries during its attack on the Syrian town of Kobane. The Coalition carried out air strikes on Islamic State weapons depots and training sites over the weekend . The recent U.S.-led strikes in Iraq hit a tactical unit and destroyed an Islamic State building and heavy machine gun near Mosul, the Combined Joint Task Force said in a statement on Monday. Strikes also hit near Falluja, Baiji, al Asad and Kirkuk. The air strikes in Syria hit near Kobani, Dayr az Zawr and ar Raqqa, destroying five vehicles and hitting a tactical unit, the statement said. The strikes followed three days of air strikes by Jordan, which said on Sunday it had conducted 56 bombing raids in that period against the militants in northeastern Syria. They targeted key bases and arms depots in a stepped-up campaign in response to the killing of a Jordanian pilot.","U.S.-led bombing raids have struck various locations in Iraq and Syria .

"A man who tricked a woman he met on a dating site into having sexual relations with him after deceiving her over his appearance has fronted court. Deepak Dhankar, 29, an Indian man, told the woman who he met on dating website Oasis he was a blonde, built, and muscular Australian man called Jamie. When Dhankar turned up to the woman's house he engaged in sexual activity with her - while she kept her eyes closed - the Victorian County Court heard on Tuesday, Fairfax reported. Prosecutor Russ Hammill told the court the woman did keep her eyes shut through their exchange, but caught a glimpse of the man's dark skin when she opened them after hearing one of her children stir next door. Deepak Dhankar (not pictured) tricked a woman into having sex with him by telling her he was a blonde muscular man called Jamie (stock image) The woman had been left suffering from crippling anxiety and panic attacks, it was revealed when her victim impact statement was read to the court. Dhankar, a married and apparent father-of-two pleaded guilty to one charge of procuring sexual penetration by fraud over the incident, which took place in October 2012. Mr Hammill also told the court the mother feared for her safety and that of her children once she became aware the man was not who she thought he was, but continued to 'play along' with Dhankar until he left. She then confronted him following the ordeal and the 29-year-old pleaded with her not to contact police, as he had two daughters that needed a father. Dhankar is said to have repeatedly called the woman that night, and sent her an image of two young girls the next day who he claimed would with be without their dad if he was put behind bars. The couple met on dating site Oasis and the woman kept her eyes closed throughout their encounter . The woman's victim impact statement revealed she considered herself a 'lesser person and a horrible mother' and blamed her trusting nature for the incident. Defence counsel Jane Dixon, QC said Dhankar's actions as 'extremely deceitful, dishonest and stupid'. 'What might have started off as experimental sexual behaviour online ... developed into a deception which had very significant consequences,' she told the court. Dhankar's wife has said she will stick by his side, and the man has agreed to undergo counselling. Judge Jane Patrick warned that people should not mislead others on dating websites. Dhankar is on bail and will be sentenced later this month.","Deepak Dhankar tricked a woman into having sexual relations with him .

"There are many odd sports taken up by thrill-seekers looking for that next adrenaline rush, but a new game of Russian roulette using Tasers must surely be one of the most extreme - and bizarre. The sport sees a group of hardcore pain addicts electrocuting themselves with the weapons, which shoot out two electrical darts through which courses 50,000 volts of electricity. Pictures show the competitors - many of them shirtless - holding 'guns' to each others heads, or their own heads, before firing them. But it seems the fun of the game is not getting shocked, but rather 'surviving' to fight another round. Scroll down for video . The game - named Perm, after the Russian city it was invented in - sees people shooting each other, or themselves, with Tasers . Tasers shoot out  10,000 volts of electricity - but players say it is just like being punched . There is only a one-in-seven chance of being electrocuted at the start of the game, as there is only one live cartridge in the seven chambers . Each of the gun-like weapons only has one 'live' cartridge in the barrel of the seven chambers - so there is only a one in seven chance you will end up writhing in pain. Players claim the shock is a bit like being punched. However, if a player 'survives' the first round, a second live cartridge is placed in the gun which doubles the chance of them firing the weapon into their body. As each round continues the number of cartridges increases accordingly. And if people get bored with just shooting just one person, there is the 'Love Triangle' where three players face off against each other . However, the game is still probably a more sensible option than the original version of Russian roulette, which uses actual bullets and comes with a substantial risk of death. And there is an added bonus for the winner, who gets to take home the 200 roubles - about £2 -each player has paid to take part. Very lucky players even win competitions, medals - not to mention the respect of their competitors. The winners - the last man or woman standing - take home the money collected from the 200 rouble entrance fee .

According to local legend, it was invented by former champion fighter Valery Eschenko, who invented it after realising his days in the ring were over due to an injury. However, whether the game is risk free remains to be seen: people suffering from epilepsy are banned from playing in case a shock induces a seizure. Meanwhile, there are questions in the West - where Tasers are regularly used by police forces - about the safety of the weapons.","Players have a one-in-seven chance of being electrocuted by the weapon .

"Elizabeth Scarrott, 28 (pictured outside court), was pregnant when she joined Shereene Warrington, 32, in confronting their ex-boyfriend Christian Plumley . A love rat who was seeing three different women was confronted by the mother of his unborn child and another ex-girlfriend after the pair discovered his new affair, a court heard. Pregnant Elizabeth Scarrott, 28, and Shereene Warrington, 32, are said to have joined forces before driving 130 miles from Gloucestershire to Devon to confront their former boyfriend Christian Plumley, 27. The pair hammered on the door of his new girlfriend's terraced home in Newton Abbot as terrified Mr Plumley cowered behind the curtains and shouted: 'She's going to get her head kicked in.' Warrington, a mother, then allegedly produced an axe from under the car seat and smashed the windscreen of Mr Plumley's grey Peugeot 206, causing £600 of damage. The two women then got back into their VW Golf and sped out of the cul-de-sac before driving for two hours back to Gloucestershire. The tangled love life - including the fact that Scarrott and Mr Plumley are now engaged with a child - was outlined to magistrates in Torquay, Devon, yesterday. Scarrott, who was pregnant at the time of the attack but has since given birth, admitted one count of causing another person harassment, alarm or distress with intent and was given a 12-month probation order. Warrington, of Dursley, Gloucestershire, has not yet entered a plea to charges of using threatening words and behaviour with intent, criminal damage and possession of an axe in public. At yesterday's court hearing for Scarrott, Nicholas Bradley, prosecuting, said: 'The defendant travelled down from Gloucestershire to Newton Abbot. 'She had previously been in a relationship with Mr Plumley. She was pregnant with his child. 'The attack related to Mr Plumley's behaviour to do with a relationship with another girl. Scarrott was very upset.' Scarrott (pictured above with Mr Plumley) and Warrington 'drove 130 miles from Gloucestershire to Devon to confront Mr Plumley'. They hammered on the door of his new girlfriend's terraced home in Newton Abbot . Warrington allegedly smashed Mr Plumley's Peugeot 206 with an axe, causing £600 of damage. She faces charges of using threatening words and behaviour with intent, criminal damage and possession of an axe . Alistair James, mitigating, said Scarrott, of Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, was dealing with personal issues and is actually a 'candid' and 'reasonably intelligent' girl. 'She did not come down to cause trouble,' he said. 'She does accept, however, that in the highly emotive environment words were said and it became a public order incident. 'In the heat of the moment she got herself into a foolish situation.' On his Facebook page shortly after the incident on June 15, Mr Plumley described the attack as a 'result ov a snake in the grass' (sic). However, after patching up their differences Scarrott got engaged to Mr Plumley and she gave birth to their son on June 29, just two weeks after the incident. On her Facebook page, Scarrott said that she could not wait to marry Mr Plumley. She wrote: 'I have finally after all these years found my sole (sic) mate, my best friend and love of my life. Scarrott, who was pregnant at the time of the attack, has since given birth to Mr Plumley's child and the pair are now engaged. She claims she can't wait to marry her future husband after settling their differences . Scarrott (pictured left with Mr Plumley and right) admitted one count of causing another person harassment, alarm or distress with intent and was given a 12-month probation order. She was also ordered to pay costs . 'It's bin ups and downs and sometimes a hard road. But all it's made me realise is haw (sic) much I love this man and the hard times just made us stronger. 'No one is perfect. But I love every imperfection of his. He has given me my third amazing son and there is nothing I wouldent do for him (sic).' District Judge Kevin Gray ordered Scarrott to pay £85 in court costs and a £60 victim surcharge. He said: 'This was an incident where clearly you have travelled and we all know the reason why. 'Clearly there has been a making up and that clearly is relevant.'

"A Syrian girl has been stoned to death for opening a Facebook account, it has been claimed. The girl, named in media reports as Fatoum Al-Jassem, was sentenced to death by a Sharia court in Al-Reqqa after it ruled having a Facebook account was immoral behaviour. She was taken to the court by Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) militants after she was caught using the social networking site, it has been reported. ISIS militants have reportedly stoned a Syrian girl to death for having a Facebook account (file picture) The court, which is under the jurisdiction of ISIS, ruled the act of being a member of the social network deserved to be punished the same way as adultery, according to examiner.com. A report in the Arabic-language Al-Rai Al-Youm was picked up by the Fars news agency, a semi-autonomous organisation linked to the Iranian government. The Iran regime has supported Bashar Al-Assad throughout the Syrian civil war. The ISIS is a pro-Al Qaida jihadist group that many fear is taking . an iron grip over parts of Syria. The . group was formed in April 2013 and grew out of Al Qaeda's affiliate . organisation in Iraq. It has since become one of the main jihadist . groups fighting government forces in Syria. It took over Al-Reqqa after rebels overran the city in March 2013. It was the first provincial capital to fall under rebel control. ISIS took over the city of Raqqa after rebels overran the city in March 2013. It was the first provincial capital to fall under rebel control (file picture) Rebels who have voiced their opposition to ISIS have found themselves arrested and thrown in jail without trial. The town’s women, meanwhile, have been ordered by ISIS via posters to ‘cover up their beauty’, according to CNN, and banned from seeing male doctors or even leaving home without a male relative. One female activist drew comparisons between the once-liberal Raqqa and Taliban-ruled Afghanistan. The ISIS is a pro-Al Qaida jihadist group that many fear is taking . an iron grip over parts of Syria. The . group was formed in April 2013 and grew out of Al Qaeda's affiliate . organisation in Iraq. It has since become one of the main jihadist . groups fighting government forces in Syria. The final 's' in the acronym Isis stems from the Arabic word 'al-Sham'. This can mean the Levant, Syria or even Damascus but in the context of the global jihad it refers to the Levant. Its precise size is unknown, but it is thought to include thousands of fighters, including many foreign jihadists. Analysts say non-Syrians constitute a majority of Isis's elite fighter corps and are disproportionately represented in its leadership. It took over the city of Al-Reqqa after rebels overran the city in March 2013. It was the first provincial capital to fall under rebel control. It also has a presence in a number of towns close to the Turkish border in the north of the country, and has gained a reputation for brutal rule in the areas that it controls. The group has been operating independently of other jihadist groups such as the Nusra Front and has had a tense relationship with other rebels in Syria. In July, a commander of the Western-backed Free Syrian Army (FSA) was reportedly shot dead by Isis fighters in the coastal province of Lattakia. There were also reports of deadly clashes between the two groups in the north-western province of Idlib. Isis also seized the northern town of Azaz from the FSA on 18 September. There has also been friction with other Islamists. In November 2013, ISIS was accused of killing a prominent member of the Syrian Islamist rebel group Ahrar al-Sham. In the most recent sign of continuing tension, ISIS suffered losses in two days of fighting against an alliance of other rebel forces in Aleppo and Idlib provinces.","Islamic State of Iraq and Syria militants reportedly stoned girl to death .

"After 40 years of fruitlessly wandering the fields - a metal detector from Southampton hit it big by stumbling on one of the largest hordes of Anglo-Saxon coins, now believed to be worth £1 million. Until that day Paul Coleman had only found a musket ball and had been moving from one field to the next when by 'pure fate' his metal detector gave a signal. And when he dug down he found 5,200 silver coins wrapped in a lead sheet - which are now set to go on display before they are put up for sale. Paul Coleman discovered approximately 5,200 of these Anglo-Saxon silver pennies, worth £1million, in Buckinghamshire late last year . Paul Coleman, from Southampton, was with his son Liam and friend Jack when he unearthed the hoard of ancient coins . Mr Coleman, 59, from Southampton, added he normally would not normally have gone up to Lenborough, Buckinghamshire. The hoard contains coins from the time of Athelred II (978-1016) and King Cnut (1016-1035) and were believed have been buried at the end of Cnut's reign. A small number of the coins were today on display at the British Museum for the launch of a report which lists the discovery as the biggest of the nationwide treasure finds. The father-of-two was with his son Liam and friend Jack when he discovered the huge find while out on a dig with the Weekend Wanderers Detecting Club on December 21 last year. A modern British penny (left) is pictured beside one of the roughly 5,200 Anglo-Saxon coins unearthed . He said: 'It was just a day's metal detecting, but it was perhaps a little further than I wanted to travel, it was about a 120 miles or so drive. 'On the day it just seemed like the thing that was going to happen. Sometimes you have that feeling, it was so natural when it happened, I can't explain it. 'I just had that feeling that the day was going to end well. 'At the time it would not have been my choice to spend that kind of money to go all that way to find nothing, because that's what generally happens. But I was talked round by my son and his friend Jack.' Just before the find, the trio had decided to leave the field they were in and move into another. While making their way they continued to use their equipment as they walked, but he found his friend's metal detector affected his, and he moved over away from him and walked directly over it. He said: 'It was pure fate, and we drove all the way to the Midlands which we wouldn't normally do, so you see what I mean I felt I was drawn to it. Paul Coleman said he had only found one musket ball in 40 years of using a metal detector before he discovered the stash of Anglo-Saxon coins . 'After that I said to Jack I will always move over.' He added: 'It's the first treasure I've found, but that depends how you qualify as treasure. I have found things which I treasure, because they are interesting, but this is the first treasure. 'The signal from the find was so large and so deep, that when I first uncovered the first coin I knew there was more than that one coin. When I picked it up I could see behind it and I knew there was more. 'There so much speculation going round and someone suggested that each Cnut coin is worth £250 and times that by 5,000 is more than £1million, but I just don't know and I don't want to speculate, I don't want to get my hopes up. 'I've been doing this for 40 years. But there aren't many metal detectors that would describe themselves as treasure hunters, that's not really why you do it.' Discussing his emotions at the time, he said: 'I think people want me to say is that I jumped up and down and run round the field, but it didn't work that way. 'It's like you've been doing the lottery for 30 years and you find one day you win, the first reaction is relief. It's hard to describe. 'I was like winning the pools, but not in the sense I was running around and dancing around. It was nice to know all that effort all paid off. I only found one musket ball before I found all those coins.' The coins are still being catalogued and examined by experts at the British Museum, before the hoard goes to corners court where the coroner will decide whether it is treasure or not. It will then be valued by independent experts before they are sold to a museum. On what he would spend his share of the money on, Mr Coleman, he said: 'I haven't really thought about it. I don't really know. 'I have to say our family home is a bit small for family to visit, from Liverpool, so it would be nice to be able to put them up if they were to come to stay.' King Canute (pictured) was King of Denmark, England, Scotland and Norway at the same time . Ethelred became King of England at the age of seven following the murder of his half-brother Edward II in 978 at Corfe Castle, Dorset, by Edward's own supporters. Given the nickname 'Un-raed' or 'Unready' (meaning 'no counsel', or that he was unwise), Ethelred failed to win or retain the allegiance of many of his subjects after the church transformed his brother into a 'royal martyr'. In 1002, he ordered the massacre of all Danes in England to eliminate potential treachery. Unable to soldier, Ethelred defended the country against increasingly rapacious Viking raids from the 980s onwards by diplomatic alliance with the duke of Normandy in 991. In 1013, Ethelred fled to Normandy when the powerful Viking Sweyn of Denmark dispossessed him. Ethelred returned to rule after Sweyn's death in 1014, but died in 1016. Meanwhile, King Canute, pictured right, also known as Canute the Great, lived between 985 and 1035. Although Danish he was King of Denmark, England, Scotland and Norway at the same time. Canute's claim to the throne of England was initially rejected by this country's noblemen so he returned home. There he raised an army of more than 10,000 men and in 1016 launched an invasion force that sailed up the Thames. According to legend he believed himself to be so powerful his command could hold back the tide. He tested this theory by having his throne placed on the shore where he vainly tried to command the tides back until he nearly drowned. However, some historians argue the demonstration was proof of his wisdom in showing courtiers he was not taken in by their flattery. After his death Canute was buried in the Old Minster at Winchester. During the English Civil War, his coffin was among those smashed by parliamentarian soldiers and his bones scattered. His bones remain at Winchester Cathedral but are intermingled with those of other deceased English kings.","Paul Coleman discovered £1m haul of coins last year using metal detector .

"One member of the public dies at the hands of the police in Jamaica every day, the Daily Mail can reveal. Since the start of the year, officers from the island’s notoriously corrupt force have killed someone every 24 hours. The shocking figure comes after a local newspaper last weekend alleged there are ‘police death squads’ operating in the country. Similar accusations have been around since the 1980s. Amnesty International has called for an urgent inquiry into the fresh claims, which have been denied by senior officers. Starling figures have revealed Jamaican police forces have killed one person a day since the start of 2014. Police patrol the streets of Kingston in 2010 after two officers were killed . A former Scotland Yard murder squad chief is already conducting an independent investigation into dozens of fatal police shootings in Jamaica – more than half of which are said to be suspicious. Ex Detective Chief Superintendent Hamish Campbell moved there six months ago, shortly after retiring from the Metropolitan Police. He describes the number of police killings on the island as ‘just incredible’. In response to claims of death squads in the Jamaica Constabulary Force he told the Mail there was a widespread belief that the police were killing people because they knew they wouldn’t get them into court. ‘There is a widespread belief that the police are killing people who can’t otherwise get to the courts.,' he said. 'The courts have huge backlogs. Trials are years and years behind. Some cases are dismissed by the courts, because the police evidence is simply not up to scratch. 'It is difficult finding people who are brave enough to sit on juries. Generally speaking, the police say they ‘all the people we shoot are criminals, they have guns, we have an encounter with them and they are killed’,’ said Mr Campbell. ‘But the obsessive deadly force does not match up with the witness testimony in many of the cases.’ ‘A long-term culture has developed (in the police) that these judicial killings will cleanse the ranks of criminals. It is a completely unacceptable and inappropriate approach to take.’ Armed police enter Kingston Public Hospital in May 2010. This year's figures reveal a rise in the number of people killed by officers since last year . Mr Campbell described a 'long-term culture' in which police officers are accused of killing criminals who can't get to court. Above, officers in Kingston tote guns while patrolling streets and stopping citizens . Mr Campbell pointed out the differences between the island's police force and that of London where the shooting of Mark Duggan by Metropolitan police sparked riots and an inquest . And he points out that the police’s method is not working as the murder rate on the Caribbean island is as high as ever. Mr Campbell, who led a series of high-profile Met investigations including those into the murder of BBC presenter Jill Dando and the ‘spy in the bag’ death of MI6 agent Gareth Williams, added: ‘Around 1,100 people were murdered in Jamaica (population 3million) last year. ‘I can put that into context by saying that across the whole of London (population around 8-9million), there were 100 murders in the year before I left.’ At the current rate, the number of people killed by police on the Caribbean island this year could surpass the 258 of 2013. That figure – which included 40 people in October alone – represented a sharp rise on deaths in the previous two years. In 2012, 219 people were killed by police while the corresponding figure for 2011 was 210. Mr Campbell, 56, knows he and his team of 37 investigators at Jamaica’s Independent Commission of Investigations – a watchdog set up in 2010 – are facing an enormous challenge as they bid to bring down the number of people killed by police. Hamish Campbell (left) said he was not concerned for his safety but for that of his investigators within Indecom. His team are pictured in Denham Town, West Kingston after two men were killed by police . After 40 people were killed in October last year, Mr Campbell¿s watchdog held a press conference to express concerns about the wave of shootings, which only merited three paragraphs in a leading local newspaper . Since he arrived on the island, six police officers have been charged with murder and he is aware that in a country where a contract killing can cost as little as £12, his job is not without its risks. He said: ‘I am not worried about my own safety. I am more concerned about my investigators.’ Last year all but 13 of the 258 people killed by the police were shot. The majority of those who died could be described as criminals, with some record or other, said Mr Campbell. He said the people killed by police . ‘are generally unemployed, criminals, individuals convicted or acquitted . at court. They are not  middle-class Jamaicans. ‘Individuals . who give evidence against corrupt officers have also been killed, as . have completely innocent people gunned down by mistake.’ Mr Campbell described the stark contrast between policing in London and the Caribbean island. Former Detective Superintendent Hamish Campbell described the situation as 'just incredible' He said: ‘I was watching the aftermath of the Mark Duggan inquest in London on TV. I thought it was quite interesting how people reacted to one single shooting by the police, which admittedly caused a riot, but which inquest jurors decided was a lawful killing. 'I saw how the Commissioner of the Met went on TV and there was a lot of media interest in the case. ‘I almost wrote to Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe, because the Duggan case had all the hallmarks of an accountable shooting – an audit trail, video recording, statements and evidence of police planning and it all came before an inquest to be explained and in that case justified. ‘Over here, in the first 13 days of January, we had 13 people shot dead by the police. ‘But very little, if anything is said. There is no police response, There is no coroner’s inquest. No public inquiries. The level of response, or lack of it, is simply alarming. ‘Indecom was established by the Government here to redress the Jamaican police investigating themselves and to try to bring down – through training and education and examination of police practices – the level of shootings. ’ After 40 people were killed in October last year, Mr Campbell’s watchdog held a press conference to express concerns about the wave of shootings. It merited only three paragraphs in a leading local newspaper – a sign, perhaps, of how even the media in Jamaica are not shocked by the frequency of police killings. At a public meeting in November, he spoke of his frustration that three years after his watchdog was set up, many in the police still oppose the crackdown on shootings. ‘In the UK and elsewhere, an independent body is just that, it sets out to investigate on behalf of the public matters of death, brutality, all sorts of things and doesn't allow the police service to interfere with the laws which have been settled,’ he added.","A person has been killed by police every 24 hours since the start of 2014 .

"The Roman Catholic archbishop of Cincinnati has criticized the 'Fifty Shades of Grey' movie as 'a direct assault on Christian marriage.' The new movie is based on the best-selling erotic novel of the same name by E.L. James that includes bondage, dominance and sadomasochism. 'Fifty Shades of Grey' follows the relationship between 27-year-old billionaire and BDSM enthusiast Christian Grey and virginal college student Anastasia Steele. Archbishop Dennis Schnurr said in a message to priests and on the archdiocese's Facebook page that the movie is in 'direct contrast to the Christian message' about marriage and sexual intimacy. Critical: Archbishop Dennis Schnurr has said that 'Fifty Shades of Grey' is in 'direct contrast to the Christian message' about marriage and sexual intimacy . His statement urges informing people about 'the destructive message' of the movie and highlighting 'the beauty of God's design for loving relationships between a husband and wife in the bond of marriage.' In full, the Facebook post read 'From Archbishop Schnurr: The movie, Fifty Shades of Grey, is scheduled to debut in theaters across America on February 13, 2015. The story line is presented as a romance; however, the underlying theme is that bondage, dominance, and sadomasochism are normal and pleasurable.' It continued 'In the story line, a young Miss Steele is urged to sign a contract becoming a sex slave and agreeing to an abusive and degrading relationship. This movie is in direct contrast to the Christian message of God’s design for self-giving and self-sacrificing love, marriage and sexual intimacy.' 'The movie is a direct assault on Christian marriage and on the moral and spiritual strength of God’s people,' the statement went on. 'We need to inform our people about the destructive message of this movie and to highlight the beauty of God’s design for loving relationships between a husband and wife in the bond of marriage.' Controversial: 'Fifty Shades of Grey' follows the relationship between 27-year-old billionaire and BDSM enthusiast Christian Grey and virginal college student Anastasia Steele (played here by Dakota Johnson) According to the Cincinatti Enquirer, Schurr's letter to priests was from February 4. The newspaper reported that the Facebook page for the archdiocese previously had a photo up with the words 'Boycott Fifty Shades of Grey' - and beneath that line were the words 'Ditch the film, and give instead to a domestic violence shelter.' A staffer mistakenly uploaded the photograph, archdiocese spokesman Dan Andriacco told the Cincinnati Enquirer. 'I'm sure the archbishop would not think it's a bad idea, but it's not his idea,' Andriacco told the newspaper. 'This is not something the archbishop specifically has asked for.' The Cincinnati Archdiocese comprises 19 counties. In an Associated Press interview published Wednesday, James said of 'Fifty Shades' 'The fact is, it's a love story, and women respond to the love story. The fact that there's a little bit of kinky sex in there is sort of like an added bonus. It's just become sensationalized, because it's like... Oh my God, women like sex. Yes we do, thank you very much!'","Archbishop Dennis Schnurr has said that 'Fifty Shades of Grey'  is in 'direct contrast to the Christian message' about marriage and sexual intimacy .

"The United States and UK have closed their embassies in Yemen as Shiite rebels have taken control of much of the country on the brink of civil war. 'Due to uncertain security situation in Yemen, we have suspended our embassy operations; embassy staff have been relocated out of Sana'a,' the State Department said. The closure follows months of unrest in the country and the southwestern end of the Arabian Peninsula, including the collapse of its US-backed government. Staff at the embassy, which was already working with a bare bones crew, will leave the capital by Wednesday evening. The US has closed its embassy in Yemen as the country teeters on the brink of civil war after the government's collapse. Above, a photo from 2012 shows Yemenis protesting at the gates of the American diplomatic building . The State Department said that the closure of the embassy (pictured with Yemeni soldiers) was due to the 'uncertain security situation' in the country . Shiite Houthi rebels, linked to Iran, have bombarded and now taken control of the majority-Sunni nation's capital Sana'a. 'The security situation in Yemen has continued to deteriorate over recent days,' UK Minister for the Middle East Tobias Ellwood said. The State Department urged all US citizens to leave Yemen, and said anyone planning on traveling to the Middle Eastern country should wait. The embassy told US citizens that 'All consular services, routine and/or emergency, have been suspended until further notice'. A British statement on the closure said the move was 'a temporary suspension of operations'. An American diplomatic car in the country was shot by 87 automatic rounds on Jan 19, according to the New York Times. Armor on the car was able to withstand the assault and two diplomats inside were able to reach safety. An embassy (pictured) statement to US citizens said that all services would be 'suspended until further notice'. The US is expected to ask Turkey or Algeria to look after its interests in the peninsular country . Yemen has been rocked in recent months by fighting between the government, Iran-linked Houthi rebels and anti-Houthi protesters (pictured) The US is expected to ask either Turkey or Algeria to look after its interests in Yemen while the embassy is closed. British citizens can ask for consular assistance at any European Union member state embassy. American officials said that counter-terrorism operations in the area would continue. Last month President Barack Obama said that 'Yemen has never been a perfect democracy or an island of stability' but that the US was able to combat terrorist organizations 'by partnering and intelligence-sharing with that local government'. The government of Yemeni president Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi resigned in late January after losing control of the military and intelligence services. He remains under house arrest. Houthi rebels bombarded and eventually took over the Yemeni capital Sana'a (pictured) earlier this year, forcing the government to resign . The US had been supportive of former Yemeni president Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi (left with Secretary of State John Kerry, right, in 2013) and launched drone operations in the country . The Houthi rebels dissolved parliament last week and Mohammed Ali al-Houthi was appointed as president, according to Al Jazeera. Mr Al-Houthi's cousin Abdel-Malik al-Houthi is the leader of the insurgents and gave a televised speech to the country on Tuesday. The minority group also announced a transitional council to act as an interim government. Rival political factions have begun UN-brokered talks after the fall of Western-backed leaders, though two parties backed out this week because of alleged Houthi threats. Observers say the breakdown of talks could lead to civil war. A statement from the UK Foreign Office said, 'We will continue to work internationally to help Yemen achieve a legitimate, transparent political transition in which all Yemenis are represented'. Saleh Ali al-Sammad, a senior Houthi figure in Sana'a, said that his party wanted normal relations with the United States and other countries. They oppose al-Qaeda's foothold in their country but are also suspicious of widespread US drone activity in Yemen. Abdel-Malik al-Houthi, leader of the Houthi rebels, gave a televised speech on Tuesday after his movement dissolved parliament last week . The country had been a key operating area for CIA agents and dozens of drone strikes over the past several years. The CIA and the military's Joint Special Operations Command conducted reportedly conducted 23 drone strikes in country in 2014, with the intelligence service leading the majority. The American Embassy in Yemen was the site of a terrorist attack in 2008, when 19 people including ten Yemeni guards and civilians were killed along with six al-Qaeda militants. Non-essential staff at the embassy were sent out of the country in September. Tuesday's shuttering of the embassy is the third such closure for the US since the Arab Spring in 2010, following the end of operations in Damascus, Syria and Tripoli, Libya.","Yemeni President Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi stepped down last month .

"A toddler is likely to need a kidney transplant after contracting E.coli on a family holiday to Dorset. Three-year-old Joseph Fincham-Dukes, along with sister, one-year-old Poppy, fell seriously ill after contacting the 055 strain of the bacterial disease. Joseph was left in intensive care for two weeks due to kidney failure after suffering from gastric illness, and it is likely the damage was so severe he will need a kidney transplant. Scroll down for video . Three-year-old Joseph Fincham-Dukes suffered kidney failure after contracting E.coli on a holiday in Dorset . Eighteen people are believed to have contracted the illness in the Dorset area between July and November last year. Ten were confirmed in the Blandford area, with others reported in Portland, Bournemouth and Poole. The Fincham-Dukes were visiting family in Portland and have instructed lawyers to investigate how the two young children contracted E.coli. Joseph's father Neil, said: 'It was absolutely heart-breaking and terrifying to see Joseph in intensive care and then going through dialysis every day. Thankfully, he is now in a stable condition but the whole situation has been very scary for us all. An outbreak of E.coli in Dorset, that is believed to have started in June last year, is still being investigated by Public Health England . 'We have been told that he is not suffering from neurological problems, but experts are unsure how this illness will affect him in the long-term. 'We are extremely upset and angry that his condition was not diagnosed earlier and that GPs were apparently not informed of an outbreak of E. coli and the symptoms to look out for. 'We want to know how this could have happened and we have approached lawyers because we heard that other children in the area were ill with similar symptoms. Escherichia coli or E.coli, is a group of bacteria that live in the intestines of animals and humans. Many strains are harmless, but some can cause serious health problems. About 35,000 people are struck down by different forms of E.coli infection every year. Many cases are mild, such as urinary tract infections, but 1,000 a year are hit by E.coli food poisoning which can be very serious, particularly to children and the elderly. The most common serious E.coli strain in Britain is O157. Symptoms include severe diarrhoea, stomach cramps and fever. Infections can cause serious complications such as potentially fatal kidney problems or brain damage. The bug releases toxins which can affect blood vessels – leading to fits and attacking the kidneys. It may also harm the heart. Infection is spread by consuming food or water contaminated with the bacteria, or through contact with infected people or farm animals. A severe outbreak at a petting farm in Surrey affected 76 young children in 2009, ten of them suffering long-term effects. The UK’s largest E.coli food poisoning outbreak killed 21 people in Lanarkshire in 1996. 'I hope that they can find out what caused our children's' illnesses so that lessons can be learned and no one else has to suffer as my children have done.' E. coli O55 is a rare strain of the bacteria which can have very serious consequences. Joseph's symptoms began in early November 2014 and he suffered with diarrhoea and sickness. He visited his doctor on two occasions, but unfortunately his condition worsened and he suffered a number of seizures and became disorientated. He was rushed to hospital and diagnosed with Hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS). He spent two weeks in intensive care and required daily dialysis for a number of weeks due to the severity of his symptoms. He is still receiving dialysis three times a week and his treating doctors have confirmed that he is likely to need a kidney transplant in the future because of the severity of the damage to his kidneys. Now Joseph's father Neil, 31, from Bath has instructed  public health lawyers at Irwin Mitchell to investigate why his son and daughter contracted the disease which ruined their trip away. Tonia Kingsley, a solicitor and expert public health lawyer at Irwin Mitchell  said: 'The illness described to us by our clients is particularly concerning and it illustrates the serious consequences E.coli can have on vulnerable people, particularly children. 'Sadly, many of our clients have suffered long-term and often permanent health problems arising from their initial infections including kidney damage and severe neurological injury. We hope that Joseph, Poppy and everyone else affected by this outbreak make a complete and swift recovery.

"Robots may well replace factory workers over the next decade, but they don't pose a serious threat to middle class jobs, claims billionaire venture capitalist Peter Thiel. Venture capitalist Thiel, who co-founded PayPal and was early backer of Facebook, dismissed claims that machines pose an imminent threat to American workers. 'Middle class jobs in the U.S. are not threatened by artificially-intelligent robots. That's like science fiction. It might happen in 100 years, maybe never,' he said on Tuesday at The Economist's Buttonwood Gathering. Robots may well replace factory workers over the next decade, but they don't pose a threat to middle class jobs for at least one hundred years, claims billionaire venture capitalist Peter Thiel . The Silicon Valley entrepreneur also said middle class jobs were threatened more by globalization, not technology. 'I'm not against globalization, but we should be very clear that that's the force of pressure on the middle class. It's not this scapegoat called technology,' he said, reports CNN Money. New research from the Boston Consult Group released this week claims that the falling cost of industrial robots will allow manufacturers to use them to replace more factory workers over the next decade. Robots now perform roughly 10 percent of manufacturing tasks that can be done by machines. The management consulting firm projected that to rise to about 25 percent of such 'automatable' tasks by 2025. In turn, labor costs stand to drop by 16 percent on average globally over that time, according to the research. Robots now perform 10 percent of manufacturing tasks that can be done by machines, according to the Boston Consulting Group, which says this will rise to about 25 per cent by 2025 . The shift will mean an increasing demand for skilled workers who can operate the machines, said Hal Sirkin, a senior partner at Boston Consulting. Factory workers 'will be higher paid but there will be fewer of them,' Sirkin said. The research found a tipping point for installing robots: Companies tend to start thinking about replacing workers when the costs of owning and operating a system come at a 15 percent discount to employing a human counterpart. For example, in the U.S. automotive industry, which is predicted to be one of the more aggressive adopters of robots, a spot-welding machine costs $8 an hour versus $25 an hour for a worker. A robot that can perform certain repetitive tasks costs about one-tenth as much as it did more than 10 years ago, Sirkin said. Costs tied to one commonly used robotics system, a spot welder, are expected to fall 22 percent between now and 2025. Three-fourths of robot installations over the next decade are expected to be concentrated in four areas: transportation equipment, including the automotive sector; computer and electronic products; electrical equipment and machinery. Certain countries also are expected to be more briskadopters. China, the United States, Japan, Germany and South Korea now account for about 80 percent of robot purchases and are expected to maintain that share over the next decade . 21st century traffic warden: Research showed that images produced droids could give out parking tickets . According to Dr Maggie Aderin-Pocock, a research fellow in UCL Department of Science and Technology Studies,  care for the elderly and even children are among the jobs to be replaced by artificially intelligent beings within the next 50 years. Her research suggests human workers across a plethora of service sectors and caring professions could be replaced by droids within our lifetimes. She believes that as the rapid advances in technology achieved this century are projected to continue at an astonishing rate, this will allow robots to break free of science fiction and establish themselves in our everyday life. According to her research - which polled 2,000 people about which jobs they thought were most unpopular and could be among the first to be given to robots for the TC channel Syfy - traffic wardens (65 per cent), estate agents (40 per cent) and car salesman (33 per cent) could soon be lost to history. By 2025, robots should be able to handle 30 to 40 percent of automatable tasks in these industries. Adoption will be slower in industries such as food products, plastics, fabricated metal, and wood products, where many tasks will remain difficult to automate and wages are relatively low. Thanks to technological advances, however, robots are making greater inroads in these industries as well. 'Regardless of whether it's time to invest in next-generation robots, manufacturers everywhere should start preparing,' added Sirkin. 'They need to understand how costs and automation technologies are changing in their industries and what their competitors are up to. Stark warning: Professor Stephen Hawking says we must be vigilant about artificial intelligence . Artificial Intelligence has been described as a threat that could be 'more dangerous than nukes'. Now a group of scientists and entrepreneurs, including Elon Musk and Stephen Hawking, have signed an open letter promising to ensure AI research benefits humanity. The letter warns that without safeguards on intelligent machines, mankind could be heading for a dark future. The document, drafted by the Future of Life Institute, said scientists should seek to head off risks that could wipe out mankind. The authors say there is a 'broad consensus' that AI research is making good progress and would have a growing impact on society. It highlights speech recognition, image analysis, driverless cars, translation and robot motion as having benefited from the research. 'The potential benefits are huge, since everything that civilization has to offer is a product of human intelligence; we cannot predict what we might achieve when this intelligence is magnified by the tools AI may provide, but the eradication of disease and poverty are not unfathomable,' the authors write. But it issued a stark warning that research into the rewards of AI had to be matched with an equal effort to avoid the potential damage it could wreak. For instance, in the short term, it claims AI may put millions of people out of work. In the long term, it could have the potential to play out like a fictional dystopias in which intelligence greater than humans could begin acting against their programming.","Dismissed claims that machines pose an imminent threat to American workers .

Scroll down for video . Full of gas: The world's longest aircraft - part airship, plane and helicopter - has been unveiled in Cardington, Bedfordshire. It will be used for surveillance and aid missions... and resembles something very familiar . The world's longest aircraft, which can stay in the air for up to three weeks, has been unveiled. It will be vital in delivering several tonnes of humanitarian aid . Does my bum look big in this? The amusingly-shaped aircraft has been funded by the singer in Iron Maiden . Useful: It's claimed the unusual craft could be used for surveillance, staying airborne for three weeks at a time . The giant aircraft is being displayed at Cardington in Bedfordshire in the only hangar big enough to accommodate the 113ft (34m) wide and 85ft (26m) high beast. Bruce Dickinson, lead singer of Iron Maiden and a high-profile investor in the aircraft, compared the ship to Thunderbird 2 and described it as a 'game changer.' 'It will be able to cross the Atlantic and launch things right where they need to be,' he told Radio 4’s Today programme. At 300ft, the aircraft is longer than the biggest airliner, the Airbus A380, which is 239.5ft. It is also almost 30ft (8m) longer than the airlift cargo aircraft Antonov An-225, which was until now the longest aircraft ever built . Now that's rock-n-roll!

Bruce Dickinson (left), lead singer of Iron Maiden, compared the ship to Thunderbird 2 (left) and described the craft as a 'game changer' 'It can reach about 100mph and stay airborne for about three-and-a-half weeks.' The low carbon ship, known as the HAV304, doesn't require a runway to take off and is thought to be about 70 per cent more environmentally friendly than a cargo plane. It is due to fly in the UK later this . year and is designed to stay airborne for up to three weeks to help with . activities such as surveillance, communications and delivering aid. Created by Hybrid Air Vehicles and first flown in the U.S, the ultra-green HAV304 project has just received a £2.5 million grant from the UK government. Pictured is the HAV304 arriving at Cardington in December. The aircraft is about 70 per cent more nvironmentally friendly than a cargo plane and doesn't need a runway to take off . Cardington hangar, which now houses the aircraft, was built 100 years ago and is where they built the ill-fated airship, R101 (pictured), in the 1920s . Volume: 1,340,000 ft³ (38,000 m³) Length:  302 ft (92m) Width:    143 ft (43.5m) Height:   85 ft (26m) Endurance: 5 days manned Altitude: up to 20,000 ft (6,100 m) Speed:  92 mph (148 km/hr) Weight:  44,100 lbs (20,000 kg) Payload capacity: 22,050 lbs (10,000 kg) It looks like giant airship but it has a unique aerodynamic shape that means it can also create lift just like an aeroplane wing. The cambered shape provides up to 40 per cent of the vehicle’s lift. This allowed engineers make the machine heavier than air, removing the need for crew to hang onto ropes to hold it down.  A number of ballonets fore and aft in each of the hulls provide pressure control. The aircraft is powered by four 350 hp, four litre V8 direct injection, turbocharged diesel engines. Two engines mounted forward on the hull and two on the stern of the hull for cruise operation. The plan is that the HAV304 will eventually lead to the development of the Airlander 50, which would be able to transport 50 tonnes of freight. HAV304 Hull and Mission Module arriving at Cardington. Hybrid Air Vehicles plans to produce around 10 a year for the next four or five years . The huge aircraft combines the best of aeroplane, airship and helicopter design. HAV believes there could be a world market for between 600 and 1,000 of these aircraft. For the time being, the company plans to produce around 10 a year for the next four or five years. This is expected to lead to the creation of 1,800 jobs in the Bedfordshire area. ‘The growing aerospace sector has the potential to generate thousands of new jobs and billions of pounds to the UK economy in contracts,’ business secretary Vince Cable said today. ‘That is why so much effort is being put in by government and industry to ensure we stay ahead of the competition and build on our strong position as second in the world for aerospace.’ He added: ‘As part our long-term industrial strategy we are jointly funding £2 billion of research and development into the next generation of quieter, more energy-efficient and environmentally-friendly planes. ‘That includes backing projects like HAV's innovative low-carbon aircraft which can keep us at the cutting edge of new technology. Here is a British company that has the potential to lead the world in its field.’ Cardington hangar, which now houses . the aircraft, was built 100 years ago and is where they built the . ill-fated airship, R101, in the 1920s. The R101 was twice as long as the hybrid air vehicle and had a dining room and lounge on board. However, it was engulfed by fire after it crashed in France in 1930.

"The latest hazard caused by this winter’s devastating storms and floods has been revealed by police – unexploded bombs. The storms that have ravaged and reshaped parts of the British coastline have led to the discovery of wartime shells long-buried on beaches. There are also fears that flooding along the Thames will erode riverbanks, leading to the discovery of bombs dropped on the area by the Luftwaffe during the Second World War. Remnants: Ammunition has been unearthed by the terrible weather that battered Britain's coasts . Police say that high tides and huge waves have either exposed devices or brought them closer to the surface. Further storms and flooding are expected today as a new front moves in from the Atlantic. The Met Office has issued three severe rain warnings and gusts of wind are expected to reach 70mph. The Environment Agency also still has 48 severe flood warnings issued across the UK following what the Met Office has described as the wettest winter on record. Now walkers are being urged not to touch unidentified metal objects but to alert police to their finds instead. In South West England and West Wales, which bore the brunt of the storms, six devices have been handled by bomb disposal units in six weeks. The Navy’s Southern Diving Group said it had received a 20 per cent increase in reports of unexploded bombs since January. A 100lb Mk XIX Second World War . British anti-submarine mine was found by surfers at Watwick Bay, . Haverfordwest, while a rare First World War German mine surfaced on a . beach near the popular Cornish resort of Newquay. Two mortar shells were found . in Poole Harbour, and mortars have emerged on the shore at Mountbatten . Point, Plymouth, and Crow Point, North Devon. Across the country, more mild weather has seen the floods almost vanish from Thames-side streets . This is how the same street looked a week ago, as rescue workers were force to wade through . A shell at Minehead, Somerset – close to a former naval firing range – was also made safe. Meanwhile a mortar was discovered on a beach at Hemsby, Great Yarmouth. ‘Ferocious seas and weather are thought to be responsible,’ said Sergeant Lee Henderson of Devon and Cornwall Police. ‘There is also the potential for further bad weather to unearth more devices. ‘The bombs may still be very dangerous and people should not touch them but call police officers immediately.’ Other glimpses of wartime Britain have been uncovered at Woolacombe, North Devon, one of the key training beaches for the D-Day landings. The storms  revealed an old pill box together with concrete anchorages and pile-driven iron girders. Meanwhile vessels in the English Channel have been warned to watch out for empty shipping containers washed from the Danish-owned Svendborg Maersk cargo ship during the Valentine Day’s storm. About 520 containers were lost and Falmouth Coastguard said: ‘There are a lot and they’re a hazard. The owners are trying to recover what they can.’ The Maritime and Coastguard Agency’s Receiver of Wreck, Alison Kentuck, has warned that anyone recovering items must report finds within 28 days.","Weather reshaped parts of British coastline to reveal weapons .

"A motorist in California claims that a gas pump continued to take his money after it stop dispensing fuel, with video evidence to prove it. Luis Maya said he was at a Costco store on Pelandale Avenue in Modesto on February 4 when the incident happened and quickly whipped his phone out to record the 'scam'. Footage shows a price sign on the pump continuing to creep up at the rate of around one cent every three seconds despite the nozzle being outside of the vehicle not dispensing gas. Maya apparently told Costco staff  about what had happened and showed them his film. They reported that they'd been having similar problems with another pump. Maya said he was outraged over the extra charges. 'I feel this is stealing, even though it's some change coming out of my account, but it adds up when you have hundreds of people that may not check throughout the day.' He uploaded his video to YouTube to serve as a warning to other drivers. Unfair charges: A motorist in California claims that a gas pump continued to take his money after it stop dispensing fuel, with video evidence to prove it . Caught on camera: Luis Maya said he was at a Costco store on Pelandale Avenue in Modesto on February 4 when the incident happened and quickly whipped his phone out to record the 'scam' 'When you're done pumping, check to see if it's still taking your money when it shouldn't, no matter what gas station,' Maya advised. According to the gas nozzle manufacturer Husky, there are many causes behind the phenomenon known as 'meter creep'. It can indicate that parts on the pump need replacing or there is a problem inside the dispenser. Fuel dispensers are subject to stringent requirements regarding safety, accuracy and security. The exact details differ between countries. Almost all California counties by law inspect gasoline pumps at least once per year. However, in Arizona checks are completed every four years unless there is a complaint. Maya says he will be more vigilant for 'meter creep' from now on. 'This isn't OK,' he concluded.","Luis Maya said he was at a Costco store on Pelandale Avenue in Modesto on February 4 when the incident happened .

"Admiral Lord West of Spithead was on board a cruise liner when the captain told him they had been threatened with a fine, if they did not lower the red ensign . A former First Sea Lord who served in the Falklands War has today accused Argentina of 'flexing its muscles', by banning all non-military British ships flying the 'red duster' flag. Originating in the 17th century, the red ensign was flown by all Royal Navy vessels. But later it became the civil ensign for the United Kingdom. Admiral Lord West of Spithead, who was at the helm of his frigate HMS Ardent when it was bombed and sunk during the Falklands war, was on a cruise earlier this month, when he learned of new laws imposed by the Argentinians. He told Channel 4 news he was a passenger on Cunard's liner, the Queen Victoria cruise ship earlier this month when he discovered his old enemy had been 'flexing their muscles'. He said while dining with the captain one night, she told how she had been threatened with a fine of $10,000, and warned 'there would be trouble', if she didn't take down the red flag. The red duster, as it is known, is flown by all British non-military ships. But Argentina's largest region has passed a law banning vessels flying the flag from docking in Buenos Aires. 'I think it’s an insult – it’s an insult to the nation,' Admiral West said, describing the provincial law as 'atrocious'. The law is believed to apply only to ships that have travelled to the Falklands. As such, the Queen Victoria, should not have fallen foul of the new rule. A Foreign Office spokesman said: 'We . condemn any attempts by the Argentine authorities to unnecessarily . interfere with the legitimate transit of UK-flagged vessels…This appears . to be another example of unacceptable harassment and intimidation…We . are urgently discussing the matter with Carnival UK [Cunard's parent . company] and will raise this with the Argentine authorities.' Argentina's president Cristina . Fernández de Kirchner stoked tensions with Britain when she called for . David Cameron to hand the Falklands back to her country. Admiral West - a Labour peer - said he plans to ask questions in parliament about the latest diplomatic incident. Admiral West accused Argentina of 'flexing its muscles' after the country's largest region banned British ships bearing the 'red duster' flag from docking in Buenos Aires . Admiral West was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross for his leadership during the Falklands War . Admiral West was was promoted to commander in 1980, taking control of the frigate HMS Ardent. He was deployed to the Indian Ocean, where he took part in the first Armilla Patrol. In 1982 he laid a wreath off the coast of Norway, on the spot where the previous Ardent had been sunk by the Germans during the Second World War. Shortly afterwards, the ship was deployed to the South Altantic, for the Falklands War. She sank in Falkland Sound on May 21, 1982, during the successful operation to regain control of the islands. West was the last to desert the sinking ship. He was subsequently awarded the Distinguished Service Cross for his leadership and led the victory parade through the City of London on return from the Falklands. He remains President of the HMS Ardent Association. In 1986, while working on the Naval Staff at the Ministry of Defence, West left documents revealing large cuts to the Navy on a canal towpath. The documents were recovered and published by the Mail on Sunday. At a court martial hearing West pleaded guilty to charges of negligence and breaching security.He said the documents had fallen from his coat pocket while he was out walking a friend's dog.West was issued with a severe reprimand. A year later, West was promoted to Captian and given command of HMS Bristol. He spent three years as head of naval intelligence rewriting the NATO intelligence manual after the collapse of the Soviet Union. HMS Ardent sank during the Falklands conflict . In 1993 he was promoted to Commodore and was made Director of Naval Staff Duties at the Ministry of Defence. In 1996 West became Commander of the United Kingdom Task Group, deploying to the Gulf for first UK fighter patrols over Iraq. IN 1997 West was promoted to the role of Vice Admiral and Chief of Defence Intelligence. He was responsible for the provision of intelligence to the chiefs of staff on operations in Sierra Leone, East Timor, Operation Desert Fox in Iraq and the Kosovo war. He was created a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath in the 2000 New Year Honours.He became a full admiral in November 2000 when he took up the post of Commander-in-Chief Fleet, NATO Commander-in-Chief East Atlantic and NATO Commander Allied Naval Forces North. West co-ordinated the naval response to the September 11 attacks in the North Arabian Sea and Afghanistan. In September 2002 West was appointed as First Sea Lord and Chief of the Naval Staff.In his role he had overall responsibility for fighting effectiveness and morale of the Naval Service for the successful operations on the US right flank in the invasion of Iraq. In June 2007 West was appointed Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State at the British Home Office, with responsibility for security in the administration of Gordon Brown. He was appointed a life peer by Brown's government. In July 2007 he was created Baron West of Spithead, of Seaview in the County of Isle of Wight and took his seat in the House of Lords.","Argentina's largest region has banned all UK ships from docking in Buenos Aires if they are flying the 'red duster' flag .

"A couple have been fined for failing to control their  six noisy Jack Russell terriers whose barking kept their neighbours awake at night. Dennis Yates, 71, and his wife Valerie, 63, from Stapleford in Nottingham, failed to comply with an abatement notice ordering them to keep the noise down, a court heard. Magistrates were told the couple's dogs were so noisy they drowned out the sound of neighbours' televisions and radios and one said the barking had driven them 'round the bend'. Valerie Yates, 63, and her husband Dennis, 71, (right) admitted failing to comply with an abatement notice to keep the noise down and were fined £1,000 after they were unable to control their six 'noisy' Jack Russells . Other residents complained it was 'like living next to a boarding kennels' and said they were often woken in the early hours by howling and whining. The court heard residents complained about the barking dogs at the Yates' £170,000 semi-detached home last year. Noise monitoring equipment was then installed at their house in July 2014 after residents said the abatement notice had not stopped the problem. Prosecutor Nicola Dumville said: 'When the equipment was removed, several breaches were identified over the course of a weekend. 'There were over 50 records that captured barking and howling.' The court heard the couple had previously lived on a 24-acre plot in a £500,000 house with the dogs but were forced to move to a smaller home when Mr Yates was declared bankrupt. Lauren Manuel, defending, said: 'The couple have had these dogs for a number of years - the eldest is 13 years old. 'They've clearly been dog lovers for a number of years. It's hard to control the dogs and stop them from barking. If the postman comes or the dogs hear noises at night, it's their instinct to bark. Neighbours on Pasture Road in Staplegrove, Nottingham, complained the dogs were driving them 'round the bend' and said it was 'like living next to a boarding kennels' 'Since the prosecution, they've done everything they can to never really leave the dogs alone. Effectively they don't go out.' One of their neighbours, who did not want to be named, said: 'They are really whiny, yappy dogs and the sound of their bark goes right through you - it's like someone scraping their nails down a blackboard. 'We have been driven round the bend by the noise, I feel liked climbing the walls some days. You can barely hear yourself think. They are out of control. 'I just hope I can get a good nights sleep now because it has been a nightmare. I haven't been able to hear the radio, it's been that bad.' The dog-lovers pleaded guilty to failing to comply with the abatement notice at Nottingham Magistrates Court yesterday. They were each ordered to pay an £80 fine as well as a £20 victim surcharge and court costs of £548.38. The couple refused to comment as they left court.","Dennis Yates, 71, and wife Valerie, 63, failed to adhere to abatement notice .

"The problem of foreign fighters taking up arms alongside the ISIS terror army is growing, according to a senior member of Congress, and more than 150 Americans are now among them. ISIS operates a 'virtual caliphate' online, California Republican Rep. Ed Royce said Thursday, recruiting foreigners at an 'unprecedented rate.' 'Some 20,000 foreign fighters from more than 90 countries now make up its ranks' including at least 3,400 from the West and more than 150 Americans,' Royce said during a hearing in the House Foreign Affairs Committee, which he chairs. ISIS 'occupies territory the size of Great Britain, holds an estimated $2 billion in assets, and is believed to be the most well-funded terror group in history.' he warned. Douglas McAuthur McCain was killed in Syria while fighting alongside the ISIS terror army . Abdirahmaan Muhumed is one of 15 young Somali-American men from Minnesota who are fighting for ISIS; 'a Muslim has to stand up for (what's) right,' he told a radio interviewer last year . Executions are common within ISIS, usually staged for public consumption online; a British citizen known as 'Jihadi John' is thought to have carried out many of the killings . House Foreign Affairs Chairman Ed Royce (right), shown with  King Abdullah II of Jordan, warned of a 'virtual caliphate' recruiting Americans online to join ISIS . On Wednesday in a separate hearing before the House Homeland Security Committee, FBI Assistant Director Michael Steinback said the U.S. hasn't been able to keep track of all the Americans who might be going overseas with the intention of helping ISIS. 'We don't have it under control,' Steinbeck said. 'If I were to say that we had it under control, then I would say I know of every single individual traveling. I don't. And I don't know every person there and I don't know everyone coming back. So it's not even close to being under control.' Even more troubling, he said Wedneday, is the possibility of Americans returning from their time alongside ISIS with the motive of attacking U.S. targets. 'Certainly I would not be truthful if I told you we know about all the returnees,' he said. 'We know what we know. There is a number that we don't know about.' An exasperated Texas Republican Rep. Mike McCaul, who chairs the Homeland Security Committee, later said of ISIS that 'they're barbarians. And I think the barbarians are at the gate. But we want to keep them outside the gate of the United States.' American authorities confirmed in August 2014 that a California man who once considered himself an aspiring rapper had been killed in Syria while fighting for ISIS . Douglas McCain was 33. He converted to Islam from Christianity, later adopting an identity on Facebook as 'Duale ThaslaveofAllah.' His Twitter biography read: 'It’s Islam over everything.' At least 15 Somali-Americans from Minnesota have also been lured to Syria and Iraw to fight with the murderous jihadi group. Abdirahmaan Muhumed told Minnesota Public Radio in June 2014 that he was fighting for ISIS when it captured the Iraqi cities of Mosul and Tikrit. ISIS's terrorist ranks now include thousands of foreigners who have streamed into Syria and Iraq from nearly 100 countries . 'A Muslim has to stand up for (what's) right,' the 29-year-old wrote on Facebook last year. 'I give up this worldly life for Allah.' Muhumed told the radio network that he and ISIS are 'rying to bring back the khilaafa' – the caliphate, or Islamic empire. He also said 'Allah loves those who fight for his cause.' Nicholas Rasmussen, director of the National Counterterrorism Center, told McCaul's committee that more than 20,000 foreign fighters overall, from more than 90 countries, have joined with ISIS on the battlefield. 'The rate of foreign fighter travel to Syria is unprecedented,"" Rasmussen warned. 'It exceeds the rate of travelers who went to Afghanistan and Pakistan, Iraq, Yemen or Somalia at any point in the last 20 years.' Congress is gearing up for an intense debate over a new war powers resolution intended to give the White House legal backing for expanded military role in fighting the organization. President Barack Obama sent his proposed language for an Authorization for Use of Military Force to Capitol Hill on Wednesday. 'Now he needs to make the case to the American people,' Royce said, calling for 'bipartisan backing behind a proposal that ensures that the Commander-in-Chief has the authority needed to decisively defeat this enemy.' 'But congressional authority is of no value if the president isn’t willing to act decisively.'","House Foreign Affairs Committee convenes hearing on ISIS threats .

"Traffic came to a standstill for the biggest load ever transported on Britain's roads - a power station transformer weighing an earth-shattering 640 tonnes. The giant transformer, a vital component used to transmit energy at power stations, and specialised transporter vehicle combined are heavier than a space shuttle.

Such an epic undertaking has never before been attempted in the UK and took a team of six heavy haulage experts nine months to plan . The generator transformer is the second and largest of three being removed from Didcot power station as part of its decommissioning programme . It began its slow journey from Didcot power station in Oxfordshire on Friday and caused 13-mile long tailbacks when it wound its way along the M4 on Saturday. Yesterday it continued along the M32 to the transformer's destination at Avonmouth Docks, Bristol, arriving at 6pm. The transformer will next be transported by sea to Cottam power stations near Retford, Nottinghamshire. Police officers escorted the load at the expense of the haulier, Allelys Heavy Haulage, one of only two firms in the country capable of hauling such a monolithic load. For months the company has been liaising with various authorities to assess road conditions and ensure bridges can take the crushing payload, even dispatching their own structural engineers to assess them. Typically, two or three trucks are used to haul the transformer but more are added if the load has to go up or down a hill. Allelys transport manager Robert Ford has 23 years' experience in the field of heavy haulage and has never undertaken a job like this. He said: 'It's exciting when a job like this comes along. It makes the job interesting because every job is different.' The epic undertaking took a team of six nine months to plan and 20 staff accompany it on the journey .

The journey could not be undertaken at night - when the roads are quieter - because health and safety legislation prevents police vehicles escorting the load in darkness. A spokesman for Wiltshire Police said: 'Police vehicles had to ensure the road and traffic ahead was managed to ensure there was no conflict with the load. 'There are only a few locations where traffic could pass. Police asked motorists to avoid the area and plan alternative travel routes.'

"Nick Clegg today names the price Labour or the Tories will have to pay for him to support them in a coalition after the general election. The Lib Dem leader will use the launch of the front page of his party manifesto to set out demands for £8billion for the NHS, protection for nurseries and colleges from cuts and an increase in the amount workers can use before paying income tax. Five commitments on the front page will form the basis of coalition negotiations in the event of a hung parliament after May 7. Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg, pictured during his radio show today, will launch the front page of his party manifesto . The full manifesto will be released once the election campaign gets under way in April. But the Lib Dems say the policies on the front page will be key demands for any future power-sharing deal. It includes promises to protect spending from nursery to college throughout the next parliament,to balance the budget 'fairly', to cut taxes by raising the tax-free allowance to £12,500, to invest £8billion in improving the NHS, and to protect the environment. However, there is no mention of scrapping university tuition fees – the flagship policy the party ditched when it came to power in 2010 which lead to a catastrophic collapse in support for the Lib Dems. The Lib Dems  dismissed suggestions that the party had lost credibility on education after breaking its pledge. The front page of the manifesto sets out key demands for any future power-sharing deal . 'Don't judge us by the one policy we couldn't deliver. Judge us by the policies that we did deliver,' one source said. 'Our credibility rests on the things that we have done. In every single area on these five policies our record in government is bloody good.' In a speech in the Tory-held seat of Oxford West and Abingdon, Mr Clegg will say the Lib Dems had been 'relentless' in government in ensuring the life chances of children had been at the heart of the coalition's programme. He will say that in a new government, the Lib Dems would act to protect schools budgets in real terms as well as funding for early years and colleges. 'The Liberal Democrats will prioritise education, just as we have done over the last five years because nothing is more central to what we believe. Nothing is more important to creating a fairer society where everyone has the opportunity to reach their potential,' he is expected to say. 'Other parties will have their own priorities. And for that reason we know we cannot take the progress we have made in education for granted.' The Lib Dems have already announced plans for an £8billion tax hike after the election, in what was seen as laying the groundwork for a coalition with Labour. In a significant shift towards Labour’s position, Mr Clegg said the Lib Dems would pursue a higher ratio of tax rises to spending cuts if they find themselves still in power again after the election. He said this would involve ‘at least’ £8 billion in tax rises, more than half of which have yet to be set out.","Front page of Lib Dem manifesto spells out key demands for coalition deal .

"Teachers and healthcare professionals who fail to report suspected female genital mutilation in children will face the sack, under a new law expected to come into effect this year. Doctors, nurses and teachers would be obliged to report cases of FGM in under -18s or risk being fired and barred from practising, according to the proposed legislation. Today's announcement comes after the Government unveiled a raft of measures to crack down on the practice, including the creation of a new specialist FGM Unit which will go into affected communities. New law: Doctors, nurses and teachers would be obliged to report cases of female genital mutilation in children or risk being sacked and struck off, under new laws announced by ministers (stock image) Prime Minister David Cameron announced his intention to introduce mandatory reporting at last year's Girl Summit, attended by Hollywood actress and UN envoy Angelina Jolie. The new law will be fast-tracked through Parliament and is expected hit the statute books before the general election in May. Crime Prevention Minister Lynne Featherstone said: 'FGM is a criminal offence and it is child abuse. It can cause extreme and lifelong physical and emotional suffering and we all have a responsibility to do all we can to put a stop to it. 'We believe that introducing a mandatory duty will provide clarity for professionals and will give them the confidence to confront FGM. It will aid police investigations and increase the number of perpetrators caught and prosecuted. 'It will also send a clear message to perpetrators that they will be held responsible for their actions and help prevent this appalling crime from happening.' Crime Prevention minister Lynne Featherstone, pictured on the  International Day of Zero Tolerance towards Female Genital Mutilation last week, said 'we all have a responsibility to do all we can to put a stop to it' The new law will apply in all cases of known FGM in under 18s, whether it is either disclosed by the victim or seen by the professional. It means all teachers and regulated health and social care professionals will have to report the FGM to police within one month. If they fail to do so they will face internal disciplinary measures or be referred to their professional organisation, which has the power to bar them from practice. Ministers stressed that not all reports of FGM will trigger arrests, and police may launch a safeguarding response instead. It has been estimated that more than  20,000 girls under the age of 15 are at risk of female genital mutilation in the UK each year. It is believed that 130,000 women living in Britain have been subjected to FGM, which can cause infection, problems in childbirth and death. It is believed that these figures are much higher, but due to the hidden nature of the crime, the true extent of FGM is unknown. FGM is prevalent in Africa, the Middle East and Asia, mainly in rural communities. In the UK and tends to occur in areas with larger populations of communities who practise FGM, such as first-generation immigrants, refugees and asylum seekers. These areas include London, Cardiff, Manchester, Sheffield, Northampton, Birmingham, Oxford, Crawley, Reading, Slough and Milton Keynes. Source: nhs.co.uk . The practice has been illegal in Britain since 1985, but no one has ever been successfully prosecuted for it. NHS doctor Dhanuson Dharmasena, 32, stood trial for FGM last month, but was acquitted in less than 30 minutes amid claims the Crown Prosecution Service had brought the case because of political pressure to secure a conviction. The Female Genital Mutilation Act 2003 makes it illegal to participate in any sort of arrangement for FGM to be performed on another, either inside or outside the UK. Those who are involved in any way - be it aiding, abetting, counselling, procuring or carrying out FGM inside or outside the UK can face 14 years imprisonment. Young victims of FGM are often taken abroad during the school holidays, with the wounds healing before they return to the UK. The procedure is carried out for cultural, religious and social reasons within families and communities and it is often considered a necessary part of raising a girl properly, and motivated by the belief that it is beneficial for the girl or woman. The procedure is traditionally carried out by an older woman in the community, who often has no medical training. Often, anaesthetics and antiseptics are not used and the cutting usually takes place with basic tools including knives, scissors and even razor blades. There is a high risk of infection and damage to the genitals as well as long-term effects both physically and psychologically.","Proposed law would make it mandatory to report FGM in under 18s .

"Facebook will from today  allow users to appoint an ‘online executor’ of their profile to decide what happens to it after they die. The ‘Legacy Contact’ will be able to administer the page after you pass away by writing one last post and even approving new friend requests. They will also be able to update your cover and profile photo meaning you have no say in what your final image will be, even if the image is embarrassing. US-based Facebook has revealed a method to update your page after you die. Users can now name a 'Legacy Contact' (shown) to take over their account. The 'heir' will not have access to everything but can change key details. For example, your profile can be changed, and they can send a final status . Facebook said that the feature will work in the same way as a real-life executor of a will, only for your online profile. The Legacy Contact will be able to close down your profile, keep it frozen as a memorial or leave it as it is. However it risks confusing people who may think that their loved one is still alive if they respond to a friend request. - Open your settings. Choose Security and then Legacy Contact at the bottom of the page. - After choosing your legacy contact, you’ll have the option to send a message to that person. - You may give your legacy contact permission to download an archive of the posts, photos and profile info you’ve shared on Facebook. - Facebook has also redesigned memorialised profiles to pay tribute to the deceased by adding 'Remembering' above their name and making it possible for their legacy contact to pin a post to the top of their Timeline. -Legacy Contacts will be introduced in the US first and then expand to more countries. Setting up a Legacy Contact is completely optional. Other issues which may arise are when family members cannot reach Legacy Contacts - or if they are ex-husbands or ex-wives with an axe to grind. Facebook, which has 890 million users worldwide, said that it was responding to hundreds of thousands of requests for this kind of feature. Like other social media companies it is trying to respect the wishes of the dead whilst also being sensitive to their families. Facebook product manager Vanessa Callison-Burch said: ‘We heard from family members who wanted to post funeral information or download and preserve photos. ‘We realised there was more we could do.’ Until now when family or friends told Facebook that a user had died, the company verified the death and ‘memorialised’ the account. This meant that it could be viewed but not edited, Miss Callison-Burch said. But starting today,  users choose a Legacy Contact from their friends list under the security settings menu and they can take over. When somebody dies Facebook will put the tagline ‘Remembering’ over the user's name and notify the appointed Legacy Contact. Facebook, which has 890 million users worldwide, said that it was responding to hundreds of thousands of requests for this kind of feature. Like other social media companies it is trying to respect the wishes of the dead whilst also being sensitive to their families . The Legacy Contact can then download a copy of what they have shared on Facebook, though this does not include private messages. The Legacy Contact will not be able to log into a person’s account and remove or change past posts, photos and other things shared on a person’s Timeline. They will also not be able to delete friends, Facebook said. The Wall St Journal reported that the changes are being rolled out to US users first with the rest of the world following suit. The announcement was mocked on US TV and on NBC’s Today show they joked that people will update their status as ‘dead’. Facebook has in the past been criticised for its 'Year in Review' feature which dredged up unhappy memories of the past 12 months including breakups. On Twitter many thought that the Legacy Contact feature may be going too far. Quinn Warnick wrote: 'Designated my wife as my ""legacy contact” on Facebook in case I die. Nope, that didn’t feel weird AT ALL'. And Hannah Hannah Cushma wrote: 'btw Facebook's canned designated legacy contact notification message ends ""Please let me know if you want to talk about this.""' From Facebook to Instagram, we spend an increasing amount of time documenting our lives on the internet. Now there’s a service that claims to allow people to set up an ‘online tomb’ so they can create their own web-based memorial to show themselves in the best light after death too. The satirical service, called EverTomb costs from $1 a month and lets users add new features so the digital tombs will ‘evolve to a great and probably creepy memorial of your online existence.’ The Amsterdam-based start-up’s website says that tombs can also be used during their owner's lifetime. It reads: ‘Your tomb lets followers connect with you in the social afterlife and make some beautiful offerings.’ Essentially, it offers users the chance to make a memorial for themselves, despite being alive. Currently there are no examples of what these tombs may look like, but 202 people have signed up so far. The satirical site includes instructions, such as: ‘Let people know that you died online or just prepare for the afterlife like a great digital Pharaoh.’","US-based Facebook reveals tool to update your page after you die .

"Voting for Ukip is about a 'state of mind', not policies, Nigel Farage will say today. In his first major election event, the Ukip leader will use a speech in Essex to pledge to fight a 'positive' campaign that highlights the party's values and beliefs. Last month, it emerged that Ukip policy chief Tim Aker had been forced to quit after falling behind on work to finish the party's manifesto. Ukip's 2010 manifesto included a number of bizarre policies, such as requiring taxi drivers to wear uniforms. Mr Farage was later forced to disown it, saying it was 'drivel' that had been written by an 'idiot'. Scroll down for video . Upbeat approach: Voting for Ukip is about a 'state of mind', not policies, its leader Nigel Farage will say in a speech in Essex today . But Mr Farage last night said the party's supporters were more interested in its general approach than its detailed policies. He said: 'We will have a fully-costed manifesto, with policies across a range of issues. But I actually think people are looking for the right type of people – they are sick of the college kids of the political class who are in hock to the big corporates. We are different – we are unashamed to be patriotic. 'It's about a state of mind, an attitude. We are on the side of the small guy, we are on the side of patriotic people, we believe in a Britain that is free and independent with a proper border control policy, and people know that.' The three main parties launched their election campaigns six weeks ago, but Mr Farage said voters were not yet ready to pay attention. And he accused them of a conspiracy of silence on immigration. 'They have started miles too early – already they are boring the public to death,' he said. 'Labour are trying to weaponise the NHS, the Tories pretending everything in the garden is rosy – both of them barely credible. 'Neither of them is offering any solution at all to the immigration issue and its impact on jobs, schools and hospitals. What the people want: Mr Farage says the party's supporters were more interested in its general approach than its detailed policies . 'Instead we are getting a negative, US-style campaign of personal attacks, which we are not going to have anything to do with. They can say what they like about me - I will turn the other cheek.' Mr Farage will also make the audacious claim that Ukip, which has MEPs in England, Scotland and Wales is now the only national party. He will attack the others as 'regional parties', with the Conservatives unable to break out of their southern heartlands, and Labour making no progress outside the north.","Ukip leader Nigel Farage will make first big election speech in Essex today .

"Right wing bloggers have used the death of captured aid worker Kayla Mueller to criticise her humanitarian work with Palestinians and brand her a 'Jew-hating piece of c***.' Kayla Mueller was a dedicated humanitarian who worked across the world and in Palestine to help those displaced by war. She was confirmed dead last week after being held hostage by extremist group ISIS since August 2013. While dozens of tributes have been paid to the woman who was captured in Syria as she tried to help refugees caught up in the conflict, bloggers have used the opportunity to criticise her for her work. Scroll down for video . Right wing blogger Debbie Schlussel branded ISIS hostage Kayla Mueller a 'jew-hater' and 'anti-American' because of her work with Palestinians, following confirmation of Miss Mueller's death on Friday . Right wing blogger Debbie Schussel called her death last week 'poetic justice', attacking the 26-year-old for supporting Palestinians and trying to help those displaced by the Syrian civil war. On her self-titled blog wrote: 'So, it’s poetic justice that Mueller spent her last months as a hostage of the Islamic terrorists with whom she thought she had some sort of kinship and sisterhood. And that she died in their hands.' The post was written under the heading: 'Dead ISIS Hostage Was Jew-Hating, Anti-Israel B****.' Schlussel accused Miss Mueller of writing anti-Israel blog posts and of supporting Palestinians and HAMAS to carry out attacks and smuggle weapons by trying to help them, and stopped Israelis demolishing the houses of extremist groups. She claimed the 26-year-old 'helped Palestinians harass Israeli soldiers and block them from doing their job of keeping Islamic terrorists out of Israel' and dubbed her 'anti-American.' In a hate-riddled rant Schlussel said her reaction to news of the death of Miss Mueller and other hostages like her was 'so sad, too bad.' Joel Pollak, a political commentator in America, branded Miss Mueller an 'anti-Israel activist' for her work . Miss Mueller volunteered across the world to help refugees who had been displaced by civil wars . Her comments have been echoed by other campaigners in America. Joel Pollack, an American political commentator and author, posted on Twitter: 'Sad that Kayla Mueller was anti-Israel activist. If she understood both sides she might have avoided idealizing the enemy that killed her.' The Gatewaypundit blog also accused the American of aiding terrorists and opposing Jewish people. Miss Mueller, originally from Arizona, had been volunteering across the world since 2009 and was working at the Syrian-Turkey border in 2013. In August she travelled to Syria, desperate to help refugees displaced by the war, and was taken hostage with three other people. The 26-year-old was forced by ISIS to feature in a video to prove to her parents she was still alive and last Friday the terrorist group claimed she had died. They said she was killed by a Jordanian strike in Raqqa - a fact disputed by authorities in America and Jordan.","Kayla Mueller was captured by ISIS in 2013 and died in Syria last Friday .

"So much plastic is dumped into the sea each year that it would fill five carrier bags for every foot of coastline on the planet, scientists have warned. Around 8million tons of plastic bottles, bags, toys and other plastic rubbish ends up in the world’s oceans each year. The ‘staggering’ total is much higher than previous estimates – and enough to leave an area around 25 times the size of Manchester ankle-deep in plastic waste. Scroll down for video . More than half of the plastic waste that flows into the oceans comes from just five countries: China, Indonesia, Philippines, Vietnam and Sri Lanka. Because of the difficulties in working out the exact amount, since much of it may have sunk, the scientists said the true figure could be as much as 12.7million tons polluting the ocean each year. Dr Jenna Jambeck, one of the researchers from the University of Georgia in the US, said we are becoming ‘overwhelmed by our waste’. More than half of the plastic waste that flows into the oceans comes from just five countries: China, Indonesia, Philippines, Vietnam and Sri Lanka. The only industrialized western country on the list of top 20 plastic polluters is the United States at No. 20. The U.S. and Europe are not mismanaging their collected waste, so the plastic trash coming from those countries is due to litter, researchers said. While China is responsible for 2.4 million tons of plastic that makes its way into the ocean, nearly 28 percent of the world total, the United States contributes just 77,000 tons, which is less than 1 percent, according to the study published Thursday in the journal Science. The team also warned that this ‘ocean of plastic’ can harm sea life. Turtles can mistake plastic bags for jellyfish and eat them. The bags then block their stomachs, which causes them to starve to death. Sea birds also often mistake floating plastic for food; over 90 per cent of fulmars found dead around the North Sea have plastic in their stomachs. It is also feared that it could harm our health to eat fish that have consumed plastic. The scientists reached their figures by analysing data on the amount of waste generated and how well it is disposed of in 192 coastal countries. This included litter left on beaches as well as plastic from fly-tipping and badly-managed rubbish dumps. Their figures are much higher than those from previous studies, which only looked at rubbish floating on the surface and did not factor in the plastic that had sunk to the sea floor or was trapped in ice. They estimated that between 4.7million and 12.7million tons of plastic made its way into the world’s oceans in 2010, with a best estimate of 8million tons. The figure is expected to rise each year. Between 2010 and 2025, some 155million tons of plastic could be dumped into the ocean – enough to fill 100 bags per foot of coastline. Piled one on top of the other, the bags would create a wall of rubbish 100ft high. China topped the league of plastic polluters, accounting for up to 3.5million tons a year, or almost a quarter of the total, the American Association for Advancement of Science’s annual conference in San Jose, California, heard. Writing in the journal Science, Dr Jambeck said that while the UK isn’t among the worst polluters, we cannot be complacent, adding that global action is needed to tackle the problem. Co-author Roland Geyer, associate professor of industrial ecology at the University of California, Santa Barbara, said: ‘Large-scale removal of plastic marine debris is not going to be cost-effective and quite likely simply unfeasible. ‘This means we need to prevent plastic from entering the oceans in the first place through better waste management, more reuse and recycling, better product design and material substitution.’ The scientists, from the University of Georgia in the US, used data on the amount of waste generated and how well it is disposed of in 192 coastal countries to come up with their estimates. Here, Jenna Jambeck of the University of Georgia collects plastic samples from a beach near Caleta de Famara, Canary Islands, Spain, November 2014.

A major victory came in June last year when a 5p charge for plastic bags was announced in England. The charge, which will be introduced by October, is expected to reduce bag use by up to 80 per cent and raise up to £100million a year for good causes. Around eight billion bags are currently handed out in England each year – or 150 per person. Campaigners say the carrier bags can take up to 1,000 years to degrade – but are used on average for just 20 minutes. Jenna Jambeck, an environment engineering professor at the University of Georgia, holds a plastic bag with trash collected last fall from a clean up at Panama Beach in Florida. Each year about 8.8 million tons of plastic ends up in the world oceans, a quantity much higher than previous estimates, according to a new study that tracked marine debris from its source .","China topped the league, accounting for up to 3.5 million tons a year .

"The president of the United States is a man few would dare to offend. But when you are the greatest basketball player the country has ever produced, it is possible to get away with a light-hearted jibe. According to a recent New York magazine interview, former presidential adviser David Axelrod (now strategic adviser for the Labour Party) said he wanted to get Barack Obama something special for his 50th birthday. Given the president had strong roots to Chicago, Mr Axelrod contacted Jordan (a Chicago Bulls legend) in the summer of 2011 to try and get him to sign a greeting for his boss. Former basketball star Michael Jordan signed a poster for the president spelling his name 'Barrack' When he received the signed poster, the president said 'I can't put this up, he misspelled my name!' He said: 'When the president turned 50, I wanted to get him something special...so I sent it to Jordan to have him sign it for me. 'To Barrack: you still owe me dinner. Wishing you well, Michael Jordan. 'I gave it to the president, and he said, ""I can't put this up, he misspelled my name!"" So I said, ""Fine, I'll take it.'"" This is not the first time the basketball star has made fun of the US President. Last year the NBA legend - who has a golf handicap of three - made a quip about Mr Obama (who is trying to get his handicap below 18) describing him as a 'hack' on the golf course. He said: 'I've never played with Obama, but I would,' he said, before promptly changing his mind. 'But no - that's OK - I'd take him out. He's a hack. I'd be there all day playing with him.' 'Do you really want to say that?' former NFL star Ahmad Rashad asked, looking at the camera, bemused. 'He's the President of the United States - he's a hack?' Jordan added: 'I never said he wasn't a great politician. I'm just saying he's a s***ty golfer.' In the past, Mr Jordan has referred to the US President as a 'hack' on the golf course and a 's***ty golfer'","David Axelrod wanted to get Barack Obama a special 50th birthday gift .

"Few things in life frighten me, but dying before my time is one of them. To achieve my dream of longevity, I lead a relatively healthy life, exercising daily, drinking in moderation, eating plenty of fruit and veg, and — most important of all — shunning fatty foods including butter and dairy products to reduce the risk of heart disease. Well, that’s turned out to be a huge waste of time! The truth is, I shall probably die at exactly the same age as my mum and dad, and I will have wasted decades on a virtuous eating plan based on a lie. This week, we were told that the advice dished out by doctors in 1983 — that to avoid heart disease we must cut our fat intake drastically, and increase our carbs correspondingly — turns out to be based on flawed evidence. Scroll down for video . Janet leads a healthy life exercising daily, drinking in moderation, eating plenty of fruit and veg as well as shinning fatty foods including fruit and veg . Shockingly, medical experts have reversed their opinion and now say they find it ‘incomprehensible’ that millions of us were advised to alter our diets, because the conclusion that fats were bad was based on a small sample of ‘unhealthy men’. (Just as shockingly, women weren’t even included in the original survey!) I can’t tell you how annoyed I am by this news, having spent all those years since 1983 eating slimy, flavourless, low-fat spreads, cutting down on meat and never roasting my spuds in beef dripping, completely taken in by ‘official advice’ from ‘government health advisErs’. Drinking black tea, not eating trifle, spurning custard and never dripping cream on my crumble. I was totally brainwashed about butter, along with millions of you. The dairy industry never recovered from the dietary warnings of 1983 — milk sales plummeted, along with those of butter, and supermarkets drastically increased the amount of shelf-space devoted to low-fat spreads, zero-fat yogurt and skimmed milk. Unsurprisingly, the dairy industry is now in crisis, and in The Archers, poor Ed Grundy has had to flog off four of his cows because he can’t make a living from the herd, while Mike Tucker can’t find a buyer for his milk round. It’s not surprising when on any given day you’ll hear yet another celebrity proudly announce that they’ve given up dairy as part of their healthy eating regime. Dairy has become horribly, unfairly demonised — and all because of bogus medical advice. Janet says that spreads such as Flora Pro-activ taste like 'taste like slimy muck' But then, when it comes to lifestyle advice, why should anyone bother listening to the medical profession? Doctors are usually over-weight, middle-aged men with flushed faces and paunches, although my own NHS doctor is the opposite. He’s a fitness fanatic, a fell-runner so scrawny he looks on the point of death every time I walk through the door. He’s always got the fat-measuring callipers handy, to check my body mass index. (Another discredited method, incidentally, of measuring how near to death we are). For years now, both Labour and Tory governments have decided to interfere and tell us what we should eat, what we should weigh, and how often we should exercise. Sod the economy, they seem to be thinking, let’s focus on the nation’s blood pressure! Politicians have become like the extra foster-mum we never wanted. By the way, both my parents ate thick slabs of butter on white bread with every meal. They loved salad cream slathered over their lettuce. They gorged on tinned ham, tongue, huge joints of red meat every Sunday, potatoes roasted in animal fat, and meat and offal at least five times a week. Yes, we ate fish on Fridays — usually in batter from the chippy, with chips cooked in dripping — and the idea of a wholemeal grain or a low-fat vegetarian meal was a completely alien concept back in Fifties Britain. They took sugar in tea, and salt was always on the table. Yet, both parents were as thin as rakes and walked for miles well into old age, even if they did smoke. But then I regularly meet healthy pensioners over 80 who survive on full-fat milky tea and bread and butter, interspersed with the odd ciggie and a glass of beer or gin. My generation of baby boomers decided we didn’t want to age like them or get wrinkly and stooped, so we adopted every life-extending fad going, starting with no saturated fat. I love the taste of butter — particularly on crumpets — but a packet of butter now lasts three months in my fridge. It sits unloved on a special shelf, next to that other devil food, creamy Gorgonzola, which I only eat when I’ve had several glasses of red wine too many. Janet says although she loves the taste of butter on crumpets, a packet of butter now lasts three months in her fridge . Full fat cheese is like a class A drug to me — a super-evil. I am a total food snob, so how I ever persuaded myself that low-fat spreads were delicious is a mystery, no matter what twaddle Lulu claimed in her advertising campaign extolling the benefits of the Flora Pro-activ ‘cholesterol-lowering’ range. Let’s be honest, all these spreads taste like slimy muck. And now we’re told we have been smearing them over our wholegrain for no reason at all. This strategy of demonising fats was shown to be a sham last year when the British Heart Foundation concluded that UK dietary guidelines on fat needed rethinking. And yet the government did nothing. Common sense dictates that eating too much fat can’t be good for us, but the advice in dietary guidelines — which substituted carbohydrates for fats — just seems to have been scribbled out on the back of an envelope. And if the levels of obesity now plaguing the population are anything to go by, the advice has been totally counter-productive. Janet says full fat cheese is a like a class A drug to her and that Gorgonzola is reserved for when she's had several too many glasses of red wine . My beef with all this is that it’s just tinkering around the edges. Instead of promoting cookery lessons in schools (they’re starting this year at long last) and encouraging people to enjoy all sorts of food and use unprocessed ingredients, the government prefers to waste millions of tax-payers money trying to encourage us to change our behaviour using ‘nudge’ tactics like giving people vouchers for free slimming classes. David Cameron said he would slash government advertising when he took office, but spent a whopping £90 million in the 11 months to November 2013, up from £64 million during 2013, and almost double what was spent in 2011. We are bombarded with public health messages about ‘healthy eating’ in every ad break on telly. Change4Life was set up by Public Health England in 2009 and made a big expensive fuss about the benefits of eating five fruit and veg a day. Last June, the National Diet and Nutrition Survey concluded that only ten per cent of boys and seven per cent of girls had heeded that advice. Yes, a million people have downloaded the app, and 1.9 million families joined the scheme — but when it came to actually EATING fruit and veg, the average number of portions a day we consume remains at three — and, like the great Butter Scandal, experts can’t agree whether it should be five portions, or seven, or what even constitutes a portion. As for me, I’m too set in my ways to change. My longevity breakfast will remain raw tomatoes or mashed avocado on a slice of heavy, seed-laden wholemeal bread, with chopped anchovies, slathered in olive oil. I can’t remember what health ‘advice’ brought me to this point, but I’m not stopping now. Heaven forbid that in a moment of terrible weakness I might even start living dangerously and buy another packet of butter. The moral of this saga? Eat a little of whatever you like, don’t listen to government busybodies — and remember that butter’s not only delicious, it’s also officially good for you.","Janet leads a healthy life, excercising daily and shunning fatty foods .

"The number of Muslim children in England and Wales has doubled in a decade, according to the most detailed study of its kind. An analysis of 2011 Census data carried out by the Muslim Council of Britain (MCB) suggests the Muslim population increased by more than a million in the ten years from 2001, rising 75 per cent from 1.5 million  to 2.7 million. The research shows that one in 12 school-age children is now Muslim, and a third of all Muslims are aged 15 and under, with half under the age of 25. A new study undertaken by the Muslim Council of Britain has analysed the 2011 Census to reveal details of Britain's growing Muslim population - as seen in this info graphic . The number of Muslim children in England and Wales has doubled in a decade, according to an analysis of 2011 Census data for the Muslim Council of Britain (file photo) And, due to settlement patterns, in some inner city areas as many as 86 per cent of all children aged between five and 15 are officially classed as Muslim. The British Muslims in Numbers report, led by Dr Sundas Ali of the University of Oxford, was undertaken by the MCB to provide detailed statistics on Muslims in the UK, and the issues affecting them, such as education, employment and health. It also predicts that by 2021, there will be approximately 300,000 Muslim teenagers in England and Wales. Although more than half of all Muslims in the UK were born outside of the country, 73 per cent of those practising the religion said their national identity was British, the  report found. It also states that around one in 20 of the population was Muslim. Due to settlement patterns, three-quarters of the Muslim population was concentrated in London, the West Midlands, the North West and Yorkshire and Humber and 46 per cent lived in the top 10 per cent of the country's most deprived areas. In some inner city wards the percentage of Muslim pupils is very high, with more than 60 per cent of children in schools in Tower Hamlets identifying as Muslim. Overall the London borough is 34.5 per cent Muslim. Although 47.2 per cent of Muslims were born in the UK, 73 per cent state their national identity is British . Just 29 per cent of Muslim women aged between 16 and 24 are in employment, compared with around 50 per cent in the overall population . The Muslim prison population is 'disproportionately large', according to researchers, with Muslims accounting 13 per cent of prisoners within England and Wales . Many wards in Birmingham have young Muslims making up more than 80 per cent of a school's intake, such as the Washwood Heath ward where 86 per cent of children are Muslims. The research states there has been a significant improvement in Muslim education - with just a quarter not having any qualifications compared with two in five in 2001 - just one in five was in full-time employment. This compares with  one in three of the wider population, with the researchers saying Muslims face a 'double penalty ... in entering the labour market - of racial discrimination as well as Islamophobia'. The report also found that: . The report stated that while the vast majority of Muslims in Britain speak English, six per cent struggle with the language, while 24 per cent of Muslims over 16 are qualified to degree level, compared to 27 per cent of the general population. Although the 2011 Census revealed there were 329,694 Muslim full-time students in 2011 - 43 per cent of them female and 57 per cent male, the study found that 71 per cent of Muslim women between the ages of 16 and 24 were not in employment - compared to 50 per cent of the wider population. In some inner city wards the percentage of Muslim pupils is very high, with more than 60 per cent of children in schools in Tower Hamlets, where this family was pictured, identifying as Muslim . Almost half of Muslims in Britain were born in the United Kingdom or Northern Ireland, according to the study . A third of Muslims in Britain are aged 15 and under, and half are under the age of 25 . Although more than half were born outside of the country, 73 per cent of Muslims said their national identity was British, according to the report . Among women aged between 25 and 49, 57 per cent of Muslim women were in work, compared with 80 per cent of women overall, according to the report. 'There are many stakeholders rightly concerned with the well-being and educational potential of Muslim and BME [Black and Minority Ethnic] youth,' the report states. 'The need of the hour is to address issues such as underachievement, low teacher expectations, high rates of student exclusions, racism and Islamophobia, lack of role models and levels of parental involvement.' Talha Ahmad, a senior member of the MCB, told the BBC the significant rise in the population could be put down in part to refugees from countries such as Afghanistan and Iraq and conversions. Other factors in population growth are the age profile of British Muslims - with more people at an age where they would be raising children - the traditions of larger families within some ethnic groups, the fact there was a better response to the Census's question on religion, and the possibility that numbers may have been under-counted in 2001. 'About one third of Muslims are under 15, it's quite a youthful population,' Mr Ahmad told the broadcaster. 'And also, more striking, is the fact that only four per cent of Muslims are 65 or over.' He added: 'We know there is a growing proportion of the Muslim population who are actually converted Muslims - they are the indigenous white population, the black population - all sorts of people. The significant rise in population can be put down in part to refugees from countries such as Afghanistan, conversions, and the fact that many British Muslims are at an age when they are raising children . 'But we have also seen that during the last decade there have been a number of conflicts that have affected the Muslim community, for example the Somali community is a growing factor. 'You have Iraqis, Afghans and others who are coming here as refugees and so on. There are multiple factors and also many Muslims are moving from European countries. 'It's a youthful population. It's still producing people but the elderly population is still not there to balance it out. It would seem as if they have had a disproportionately larger growth rate compared to the other populations but that is simply because it does not have the older population to balance it out.' The report said: 'There is need for various stakeholders - Muslim civil society, policy institutes, employers, trade unions and the Department for Work and Pensions - to facilitate conditions and opportunities in the labour market. 'Muslim civil society needs to have a better appreciation of the social realities.' Explaining the purpose of the study, Dr Ali told MailOnline described the research as 'ground-breaking', and said it was the first of its kind to be undertaken. Some 65.8 per cent of school pupils in Tower Hamlets, London are Muslim, compared to 34.5 per cent of the wider population . The majority of people living in Britain are Christian, but those who told the 2011 they were Muslim amount to more than those who put down any other minority religion combined . 'The research centres on 94 per cent of the population - that's the largest sample size you can get,' she said. 'It was much needed because there is so much interest in the Muslim community but we didn't have a set of statistics. We had data from the Office of National Statistics, but no one had analysed it before. 'This report covers Muslim life across a number of areas - education, the labour market, deprivation, health.' Dr Ali said the study was released now as it had taken a year to analyse all the data contained in the Census. 'Although the Census was carried out in 2011, they release the data in stages so the data for the 2011 Census was released in 2013,' she said. 'We started analysing it in 2013, it took a year to analyse and consult academics to get their feedback.' Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said: 'Taking data from the 2011 Census, this important new report from the Muslim Council of Britain helps give us a snapshot of the socio-economic challenges and opportunities now facing Britain's Muslim communities. 'What's not in doubt is that British Muslims can be proud of the contribution they make to our country. 'Drawing on analysis like this, together, we can help create jobs, drive growth and enable more people to get on - building the stronger economy and fairer society we want for Britain's future.'","A third of all Muslims in England and Wales are aged 15 and under .

"Two Aussie housewives who began writing  Mills & Boon novels after dropping off their kids at school have turned their love of raunchy romance books into successful and lucrative careers. Despite always being fans of the most popular genre of fiction in the world, Melanie Milburne and Ally Blake fell into their sexy writing style and have now penned almost 100 romantic pieces between them. Hopeless romantics at heart, the women love their fun jobs and say their husbands try to cheekily take credit as their ongoing inspiration for the kinky bedroom chapters. Ally Blake drops her three children at school then goes to cafe and writes her raunchy novels . Hopeless romantics - Ally and Mark got married in Las Vegas in 2000 and honeymooned throughout the U.S. Mark claims that he is Ally's ongoing inspiration for her risque Mills & Boon novels . Melanie, who lives in Hobart, has always wanted to be a writer but with a husband doing crazy hours as a surgeon she needed to hold down the fort at home and care for their two sons. It wasn't until her boys were in their teens that she found the time to give writing a go and has now written 64 Mills & Boon books in the past 12 years. 'I couldn't stop writing and the rest is history,' she said. 'I had all of these ideas backed up inside my head because I had wanted to write my whole life.' Her sons were 'quietly embarrassed' about their mother's new raunchy writing career but now adults themselves - they have an appreciation Melanie's books. 'My husband is also very proud of my career and is always offering himself up for ""research"", she said. 'Actually, he's fantastic at helping me when I write the occasional medical romance as he is a general/ trauma surgeon.' Melanie Milburne's husband Steve (right) always offering himself up for 'research' for her books . Melanie's sons were 'quietly embarrassed' about their mother's new raunchy writing career but now adults themselves they have an appreciation for her books . Ally's husband likes to claim the credit as being the  inspiration for his wife's books. 'He tries to help me write my books - I let him name the dogs and that's about it,' she laughed. 'His idea is to add an alien ship which is not terribly helpful in the genre.' Ally also sold the first book that she submitted to Mills & Boon 12 years - and 30 books - ago. The 40-year-old now drops off her two girls, 7 and 5, and her son, 4, to school before getting stuck into her script. 'I was hoping to get a nice rejection letter where the editor gives me helpful feedback so it was wild when it sold - it still feels magical,' she said. It wasn't until Menalie's boys were in their teens that she found the time to give writing a go and has now written 64 Mills & Boon books in the past 12 years . Melanie knew she was going to marry her husband of 32 years after their second date and Steve proposed six weeks later . The Queenslander makes sure she keeps away from the obvious distractions of home and heads to a local cafe or library to set up office for the day before collecting the kids after school. 'If I'm at home the fridge calls to me too much so I go to work I get dressed, put on lipstick and ""go to work"",' she said. 'I could work at a Bon Jovi concert, I can work with that much cafe noise around me - I'm very lucky that my job is portable and flexible.' Ally says she is not a 'plotter' and describes the novels that don't come naturally to her as 'giving birth to a pineapple.' 'I take a deep breath and say ""ready, set, go"" so when the readers are surprised about how a book turns out sometimes I'm surprised as well,' she says. However, Melanie says she never has a shortage of ideas for risque story lines. 'I read trashy mags and listen to the news - it  can be a combination of ideas that I just start playing with,' she explains. 'I always go through the bedroom doors but it's not erotic or illicit.' As with all great romance novels - every story always has a happy ending. 'People think it's all bout sex but that's not a huge part - it's all about the growth of the characters,' she said. A hopeless romantic, Melanie knew she was going to marry her husband of 32 years after their second date and he proposed six weeks later. 'We were looking at a painting at the Opera House and I just had this feeling - I can't explain it.'

While Ally, who confesses to having a different crush everyday of the week when she was at school,  married Mark in Las Vegas in 2000. 'I always relished that tummy flutter sensation,' she admits. Melanie, who has Billionaire's Ultimate Acquisition coming out in April, says she is never short of story ideas and has not changed her writing style over the years. 'As to readers expectations due to 50 Shades, I haven't changed the level of sensuality,' she said. 'I've always written on the passionate side - it's not erotica, however.' While Ally, who has a new book Billionaire on her Doorstep set to be released in March, describes her style as 'fun, fresh and flirty'. Despite Mills & Boon books being perceived by some as corny and cliche, the women usually only experience positive reactions when they reveal their occupation. 'It's such a unique and unusual kind of job that if you are at a party and people find out you're a romance author suddenly their eyes light up and they have a million questions, so it's quite a cool conversation starter,' Ally said.

"It's an industry known for its use of smoke and mirrors. But these candid shots taken by photographer David Strick from Los Angeles, California, show just what takes place behind the scenes of some of Hollywood's biggest movie sets. The images reveal the work necessary to create the illusions that entertain us on the big screen and even shed light on some of the unsung crew who work tirelessly to create the magic of cinema. Scroll down for video . Gigantic vampire: A special effects technician smooths down the 'skin' on vampire Pearl as they  shoot the movie Blade in 1998 . Playful: Actor David Hasselhoff appears to sit on a tripod and put his legs in the air on the set of movie SpongeBob Squarepants, 2004 . From the technician on the set of Blade  smoothing down a gigantic obese vampire called Pearl or an elephant wrangler collecting a bag full of elephant dung - some of the work showcased is the less than glamorous side of an industry known for its glitz. The photographer behind the images said his fascination with documenting the movie industry begun after his great-aunt, Gale Sondergaard, won the very first Best Supporting Actress Academy Award. However, it still took him a while to feel comfortable on Hollywood film sets. He told Slate: 'There were plenty of competent adults working the sets, and I would have felt like Bart Simpson trying to work alongside King Kong.' 'What I did manage to absorb was a sense that the work the grown-ups were doing was a high-stakes, deadly serious one, and to some extent a comically inexplicable version of let's dress up and pretend. I don't think that sense of confused awe ever left me.' The novice photographer went on to become a highly successful editorial and commercial photographer. This series of photographs came about after he was sent to do an assignment for The New York Times in 1975 and ended up seeing first-hand 'the decline of Hollywood.' Primate: Actress Charlize Theron stands beside an enormous animatronic life-like gorilla in the 1998 movie Mighty Joe Young . He gradually gained access to lots more movie and television sets and started doing regular behind-the-scenes columns about Hollywood for Premiere Magazine, the Los Angeles Times, and the Hollywood Reporter. He said: 'Making photos on a set is like spending your day jaywalking back and forth across a busy street and trying not to be run over while doing your best not to be noticed. 'The best way to describe the parameters is that you have all the freedom in the world not to be a nuisance. Some actors love outside attention, some love it right up until they hate it, some just hate it.' Strick has been fortunate to photograph a host of big name stars including Charlize Theron on the set of Mighty Joe Young, George Clooney in Oh Brother Where Art Thou and David Hasselhoff messing around in the sea in The SpongeBob SquarePants movie.

"A 20-year-old bride-to-be stabbed an unarmed teenager to death on her doorstep after sending text messages about how to kill someone ‘legally’, a court has heard. Rebecca Tootle allegedly grabbed a knife and attacked Ashley Meadowcroft, 18, in a confrontation at her home in Blackburn after the teenager was said to have turned up there with his pitbull dog. The court was told yesterday that she had earlier sent a text saying: ‘I’d love to see him break into my house when I’m there because three legal marks on me and I can actually kill him [sic].’ Bride-to-be: Rebecca Tootle (left) allegedly grabbed a knife and attacked Ashley Meadowcroft (right), 18, in a confrontation at her home after the teenager was said to have turned up there with his pitbull dog . She later falsely claimed Mr Meadowcroft had been armed with the blade and even gave herself scratch marks which she wrongly alleged occurred when she wrestled the knife off him, it was said. As police in the Lancashire town detained Tootle, she allegedly said: ‘He’s a f****** d***. He’s stabbed me so I took the knife off him and stabbed him (in) self-defence. He could have killed me. He could have definitely killed my fiancé. He broke into my address. I didn’t do it on purpose.’ Mr Meadowcroft, a former former friend of Tootle, suffered a fatal knife wound near his left armpit which penetrated his lung - and he died in hospital 45 minutes later despite attempts to save him. Preston Crown Court heard Tootle - who was living with her fiancé Matthew Moran and two other friends - had fallen out with Mr Meadowcroft and the group had moved house to get away from him. She claimed she had ‘loads of trouble’ with the teenager - alleging he had stalked her, robbed her and tried to rape her. In the run up to the killing, Tootle sent three messages on her mobile phone. The last of these, to her father, read: ‘Here’s an interesting fact, you come into my house when I’ve told you not to and I’m in the house thress [sic] marks on myself and I can legally kill you.’ The killing took place last September after Mr Meadowcroft arrived at Tootle’s home with his dog Leo after she and two housemates had been smoking the legal high drug ‘Happy Joker,’ it was said. Fatality: Mr Meadowcroft (right), a former former friend of Tootle (left; and together, right), suffered a fatal knife wound near his left armpit which penetrated his lung - and he died in hospital 45 minutes later . Mr Meadowcroft was said be ‘extremely agitated and irate’ and one of Tootle’s housemates Julian Doyle claimed the teenager was ‘provoking’ the dog into barking and growling. He was shouting up at a bedroom window demanding to speak to Mr Moran and saying: ‘I’ll (let) the dog have every one of you.’ Tootle went downstairs and opened the front door but as the dog ran into the property she came back saying: ‘He tried to stab me - I think I’ve stabbed him.’ Paul Reid QC, prosecuting, told the jury: ‘She showed a small mark on one of her arms and was saying: ""I had to take the knife off him because he’s mental"". ‘But Ashley Meadowcroft never had a knife, he did not try to stab the defendant and he caused her no injury to her arm. The defendant was lying about all these matters within a short time of her having plunged the knife into Ashley Meadowcroft’s chest. ‘It was a knife she had armed herself with from somewhere in the house before she went to confront Ashley Meadowcroft. ‘The marks and scratches were self-inflicted by the defendant in the moments before the police arrived to cause them to falsely believe that Ashley Meadowcroft was the aggressor with the knife - when in fact the truth was just the opposite. Trial: Preston Crown Court (above) heard Tootle - who was living with her fiancé Matthew Moran and two other friends - had fallen out with Mr Meadowcroft and the group had moved house to get away with him . ‘The idea that a few marks on her would justify her in killing someone who had come into her house was not something that had just occurred to her that night. ‘She had previously spoken about this is messages which police extracted from her mobile phone. On the night of the killing, she was quick to make some marks on her skin so as to be able to justify to the police her right to attack him. ‘You will probably conclude Ashley Meadowcroft was not welcome that night, but nothing that he did justified the defendant in arming herself with the knife and plunging (it) into his body.’ In a statement to police Mr Moran - known as ‘Mos’ - had claimed Mr Meadowcroft had been holding the dog by its collar with a chain wrapped around his knuckles. He claimed he went to speak to Mr Meadowcroft but had been threatened with the chain before the teenager attempted to barge past him into the house. Mr Moran fled upstairs only to hear a female shout: ‘He’s got a knife.’ Moments later Mr Meadowcroft was heard shouting: ‘You just stabbed me’ before being seen stumbling backwards down the front path and collapsing. The court heard in a 999 call minutes before the stabbing, Tootle told an operator: ‘I need police. 'There’s a lad here with a knife and he’s kicking off, he’s banging on the door, he’s got a vicious dog with him, he’s taken it off, he’s whacking the chain with him, he’s threatening to beat my friend up.’ In a second 999 call she added: 'He’s got an American pitbull with him - an illegal dog - and he’s threatening to use it.’ Held: Tootle was said to have made a number of ‘unsolicited comments’ to police as she was questioned . She then handed over the phone to Mr Doyle before being overheard saying: ‘No Matt, f****** sort it out now, don’t just f****** stand there talking.’ The call ended when the victim was heard screaming: ‘Help me, help me, I’ve been stabbed.’  Mr Reid said Tootle made a number of ‘unsolicited comments’ to police as she was questioned. At a police station she said: ‘The things you’ll do for people - you get arrested for self defence’ and she said she hoped Mr Meadowcroft would be ‘getting arrested when he comes of out of hospital’. When told she was being held for murder, Tootle retorted: ‘He’s died?' She added: ‘I stabbed him. If I didn’t it would have been me or my boyfriend. I did it, yeah, but he came into the house. It was unlocked and he had an illegal dog. ‘What if it was me or Mos? I heard the door smash. I went down and he had a knife in his hand. Mos was holding his wrist. I grabbed hold of his hand and tried to get the knife and it went in. If I intended to kill him, I would have stabbed him in the heart.’ She also showed a superficial scratch on her left forearm to a nurse who examined her and said: ‘That’s what happened when I tried to get the knife off Ash.’ She later gave a no comment interview but issued a prepared statement through her lawyer. The knife was found in a garden next door. Tootle now admits Mr Meadowcroft never had the knife but she denies murder. The trial continues.

"As chairman of Ofsted, she was the guardian of good behaviour for the nation’s schoolchildren. But a rather less wholesome side to Zenna Atkins has emerged after enraged parents complained about X-rated comments posted on her publicly available Facebook page. In one smutty post, the 49-year-old boasted of offering to perform a sex act on a ‘very handsome man’, and in another she posted a picture of herself making a lewd gesture. Parents have slammed former Ofsted chief Zenna Atkins, 49, (pictured), who is now chairman of a school's governing board, over x-rated messages she posted on Facebook . Miss Atkins was Ofsted chief from 2006 to 2010 and is now the chairman of governors at a school in Brighton. Her Facebook posts – branded ‘absolute filth’ by parents – are the kind of adult material that pupils might be scolded for viewing on their smartphones. Had she still been chief at the schools watchdog, she would have presided over its recent drive to drum into children the perils of ‘sharing personal data’. It is a lesson that Miss Atkins has learnt the hard way, after parents noticed the nature of the remarks she was sharing with the world on Facebook. One post appeared on the site saying the ‘handsome’ man to whom she had offered a sexual service had replied: ‘Nah... I’d rather watch Jools Holland!’ and she added: ‘How sad is that!’ This joke, made on New Year's Eve sparked anger from parents after appeared on Ms Atkins's Facebook page. The site was public at the time, but has since been made private . Another crude joke seen on Ms Atkins's Facebook profile when it was publicly visible . One parent sent this anonymous letter to the school, complaining about the comments and pictures on Ms Atkins's Facebook page . Ms Atkins, 49, stepped down as chair of Ofsted in October 2010 after causing fury by making comments about every school needing a 's*** teacher' It got 23 likes – seen as marks of approval – from her Facebook friends. Another posting showed a photo of three people sharing a bed under a coarse joke which began: ‘Three in a bed and the little one said...’ Miss Atkins also posted a photo of herself in a hospital bed sticking one finger up to the camera in a rude gesture. She is the chairman of the board of governors at the 900-pupil Portslade Aldridge Community Academy in Brighton. One parent said: ‘It’s just not on. My son’s class have been told time and time again to conduct themselves properly on social media, yet the chair of the governors goes and does whatever she wants.’ Another wrote an anonymous letter of complaint saying: ‘I find it appalling this lady has these things on her Facebook page for all to see, including students.

"Jaine Stanley, 4, was diagnosed with severe scoliosis of the spine at the age of two . A girl with a 63-degree bend in her spine is now a step closer to her dream of becoming a gymnast after a pioneering operation to straighten her back using remote controlled magnetic rods. Jaine Stanley, 4, was diagnosed with severe scoliosis of the spine at the age of two and forced to wear restrictive and uncomfortable plastic braces for 23 hours a day to support her back. The painful condition meant she could only sit on the sidelines as her friends played and could not even sit on the sofa because her tight braces got in the way. Instead she would sit on the living room floor of her home in Newport, Isle of Wight, where she was first mesmerised by gymnasts on television and began to dream of joining them one day. Yet, as her spine continued to curve into a shocking 63 degree bend - the worst case her spinal surgeon had ever seen - her ambition seemed further away than ever. But now the budding gymnast is a giant step closer to her goal - and an incredible four centimetres taller - after a pioneering operation to straighten her spine. Jaine had the life-changing seven-and-a-half hour operation in October and was the first - and youngest - patient to have the surgery at Southampton Children's Hospital, Hampshire. The MAGEC rods brace the spine to minimise the growth of scoliosis and are lengthened over time using an external remote control. This is placed on top of the skin and triggers a magnetic motor inside the rods to cause them to grow. The process, first introduced in 2009 and now NHS England's recommended practice, replaces the need to operate to manually lengthen the growing rods every six to nine months. Jaine will next return to the hospital every 12 weeks, when her rods can be lengthened within just minutes during a routine outpatient appointment. She will have her first follow up appointment later this month and hopes to start gymnastics lessons in the coming months. Jaine's mother Berenice, 42, said: 'The difference in Jaine is already amazing. 'We couldn't believe it when she came out of the operation four centimetres taller - in less than eight hours. 'We've taken her swimming since the operation and she was over the moon that she could finally touch the floor of the pool. 'She has always been so positive and despite the discomfort she felt with her braces, she just got on with things the best she could. Jaine was unable to play with friends after the severe scoliosis left her in crippling pain. Pictured is an x-ray of her back prior to having the pioneering operation . Jaine's back was bent at a 63 degree angle (left) before the operation straightened her spine (right) 'She'd put the braces on her teddy bears when she wasn't wearing them. But it was horrible to see her missing out on bouncy castles or soft play parties and struggling in the summer as she got hot and uncomfortable. 'It's still early days so we are taking it slowly but now she's set her sights on becoming a gymnast. She keeps talking about getting a leotard. It's lovely to see her so happy.' Mrs Stanley began to have concerns about Jaine when she was two and a family friend pointed out that her body did not look 'straight'. The mother-of-eight, who owns a burger van with partner Myles, 47, said: 'When Jaine got to about two years old we noticed that she didn't look straight and her body was going off to the side. 'It was concerning so we took her for an x-ray and she became the youngest child on the island to be diagosed with scoliosis.' Jaine had to be fitted with for four different braces over the next two years, which she had to wear for 23 hours a day. The tube-shaped plastic frames encased her torso and works to support Jaine's spine, but they had to be fastened tightly to be effective. Her mother said: 'She had to wear the brace all day and it would dig into her armpits and make her very hot in the summer. The MAGEC rods inside Jaine brace the spine to minimise the growth of scoliosis and are lengthened over time using a remote control . Hospital x-rays show the two rods implanted in her back, which are extended using remote controls in order to help straighten her spine . Scoliosis is a condition that causes the spine to curve to the left or right. While it is usually mild and doesn't require treatment, severe cases such as Jaine's require back braces or surgery. The word itself comes from the Greek word meaning crooked - and it can form in either the upper or lower spine. It generally starts during puberty and begins gradually and painlessly. But if it is severe, it can become disfiguring as the bending spine contorts nearby muscles, vertebrae and ligaments. If not treated properly, it can cause back pain, breathing and heart problems later in life. 'She would flip it off her body when she was asleep and give it to her teddies to wear when she was having a break. It supported her completely for 23 hours of the day and when she took it off, her spine would curve back around again. 'It was so hard for her because she couldn't play with her friends or join in on the bouncy castles at parties, but she stuck with it and got on the best she could.' The life-changing surgery was carried out by Consultant Orthopaedic Adult and Paediatric Spinal Surgeon Christopher Dare. Mr Dare said: 'Jaine's curvature was certainly the worst case of early onset scoliosis I've ever seen. 'I've never have I seen it progress quite so rapidly and to that sort of size, because we do try to stop it getting so bad with the use of braces but it was relentless in this case. 'The braces press on the rib cage externally to try to manipulate the spine into a straight position and hold it there while it grows. 'Often the bones are too small to operate on at that age and so the braces hold things in place until the child is old enough for us to operate. 'However, with Jaine it was clear - with a 63 degree bend - that we were losing the battle against the scoliosis with the braces and so the external pressure wasn't working and we needed to operate to fit the internal rods. Jaine is now looking forward to fulfilling her ambition of becoming a gymnast - something she was unable to do before undergoing the operation . Jaine's mother Berenice Stanley said she began to have concerns about her daughter when she was two and a family friend pointed out that her body did not look 'straight' 'Historically, we used screw in rods which we would have to operate every six to nine months to stretch the rods out under general anaesthetic. 'The advantages of the rods is they have a magnetic motor built into the rod, which is driven by an externally applied magnet. 'So rather than have the operation to stretch the rods, we can place a magnetic motor on the skin and use that to stretch the rods, without exposing the rods and risking infection.' He added: 'Jaine will have that lengthening procedure every three months until she is eight or nine. 'A scoliotic spine does not grow like a normal spine, so we are trying to achieve as much longitudinal growth of the spine as possible. 'We will lengthen the spine for as long as we can, usually until a child is 11 or 12, and when it is unlikely to grow any more we will then do a final spinal fusion to fix it into a fixed position.'","Jaine Stanley was diagnosed with severe scoliosis of the spine aged two .

"Half of all violent attacks last year were fuelled by alcohol – with pub closing time on a Friday night accounting for one in three assaults. Of the 1.3million violent crimes reported in England and Wales last year, some 53 per cent were booze related, figures released by the Office for National Statistics revealed. The figures also showed that most booze-fuelled crime took place between 11pm to 1am on a Friday night - when 31 per cent of all assaults took place. Of the 1.3million violent assaults reported in England and Wales last year, 53 per cent were booze related . Men are far more likely to be victims of alcohol-related violence  – with six out of 10 attacks on men. Two-thirds of violence between strangers also involved alcohol, while one-third of domestic violence occurred after drinking, the figures revealed. Eight out of 10 violent incidents were alcohol-related between 10pm and midnight, whereas booze only played a part in half the violent attacks earlier in the evening, between 6pm and 10pm. The trend continued into the early hours - with alcohol featuring in 84 per cent of all violent incidents between midnight and 6am. According to the Crime Survey for England and Wales, violent incidents at the weekend were twice as likely to involve alcohol as during the week. Andrew Brown, director of policy with charity DrugScope, said: ‘Today’s statistics on alcohol-related violence show the extent of the problem, with more than half of all violent incidents involving alcohol. ‘DrugScope’s state of the sector report, published today, found that almost half of substance misuse services are seeing an increased demand for alcohol treatment. We also know that every £1 invested in alcohol treatment saves £5 in health, care and criminal justice costs. ‘Making sure that people who need treatment are able to get it must be an important part of the response to alcohol-related violence.’ Analysis of the ONS statistics showed 13 per cent of all threats to kill offences involved alcohol, while some 43 per cent of assaults on police officers occurred after drinking. Home Secretary Theresa May has welcomed falling crime figures - including an 18 per cent fall in alcohol related crime . Separate analysis showed the number of incidents involving  alcohol had dropped by more than 150,000 between 2012/13 and last year. There were 704,000 such incidents reported in the latest batch of annual figures - the lowest in two decades. A spokesman for the Portman group, which represents alcohol producers, said: ‘It is good news that alcohol-related violent crime has fallen by 18 per cent in just one year. ‘But alcohol-related harms still remain and some areas suffer more than others. The best way to support these communities is to get local businesses, police, local authorities and health services working together to improve town centres, tackle harmful drinking and make our high streets safer places to enjoy.'","More than 650,000 violent assaults in England and Wales alcohol related .

"Twenty eight Alabama counties have stopped issuing all marriage licenses rather than comply with a federal court order to legalize same-sex unions. Now 3.1million people - straight and gay alike - are caught in a tug of war between US District Judge Callie Granade and Alabama Chief Justice Roy Moore, who has said told counties not to comply with the federal ruling. By Wednesday, only 23 of the state's 63 counties were issuing licenses to same-sex couples. That leaves two-thirds of the state refusing to follow Judge Granade's order. Sixteen counties are issuing marriage licences to only straight couples. John Humphrey (left) and James Strawser  wait for a marriage license along with several other gay couples at the Mobile County Probate office, where the local judge has decided to stop issuing all marriage licenses - even to straight couples . Just 23 of the 63 counties in Alabama have opted to obey a federal judge's ruling and begin issuing marriage licenses to gay couples . Twenty eight counties (pictured in red) have stopped issuing marriage licenses to anyone, while 16 (in grey) are issuing licenses to only straight couples - that makes two thirds of the counties refusing to comply with a judge's order . One study in 2013 suggested that just 2.8percent of Alabama's population is gay, lesbian or transgender. In Mobile, on Tuesday 51-year-old James Strawser and  38-year-old John Humphrey sat outside the marriage license window at the county courthouse - protesting the fact that local officials refused to open it and give them - or anyone else - a marriage license. 'Come on, you've got a federal order. Open those windows,' Strawser said, to no avail. Strawser and Humphrey filed one of the lawsuits for the right to marry in Alabama. US District Judge Callie Granade's order overturning Alabama's same-sex marriage ban took effect Monday. Granade has been on the court since 2002 after she was appointed by President George W Bush. Alabama Chief Justice Roy Moore on Sunday night ordered the state's probate judges to not issue the licenses, arguing that probate judges were not bound by Granade's decision since they were not defendants in the lawsuit that led to the order. President Barack Obama, in an interview with BuzzFeed News, was asked about Moore's resistance and the comparisons some have made to Alabama Governor George Wallace's efforts to fight integration 50 years ago. Tug of war: Alabama Chief Justice Roy Moore (left) has ordered state probate judges to ignore US District Court Judge Callie Garande's ruling legalizing gay marriage . 'I won't say it's a perfect analogy, but there's a core principle here that's at stake, which is we have a supremacy clause in our Constitution,' Obama said. 'My recollection is that Judge Moore had a similar problem with a federal court ruling that you couldn't put a huge ... Ten Commandments statue in the middle of your courthouse and, ultimately, federal law was obeyed and I think that the same thing will end up happening here,' Obama said. Granade on January 23 ruled that the state's marriage ban was unconstitutional in a case brought by two women seeking to have their California marriage recognized by Alabama. She struck a second blow to the law on January 26 in the case brought by Humphrey and Strawser, who were seeking to get married. At least 19 of the state's 67 counties had issued wedding licenses to same-sex couples or said Tuesday they would do so, compared to just seven on Monday. The exact number of counties refusing to sell licenses wasn't immediately clear. Robert Povilat, left, and Milton Persinger, comfort each other after hearing that for a second day, the Mobile County Probate office won't issue marriage licenses . Elmore County Probate Judge John E. Enslen said in a statement Tuesday that 'the dust has quickly settled' and it was clear same-sex marriages were allowed. 'Whether national or not, it now applies to Alabama,' he said. Limestone County Probate Judge Charles Woodruff began issuing same-sex licenses Tuesday after seeking legal advice because of the conflicting opinions. 'I wasn't sure what the law was,' Woodruff said. 'I have never received an order from the chief justice of the Supreme Court in an email before.' Robert Povilat, 60, and Milton Persinger, 47, were among the couples waiting in Mobile for a second day on Tuesday. They said they would return every day until they were able to get a marriage license there. 'We sat and waited all day for them to open a window,' Povilat said. 'They never did.' Mobile County Probate Judge Don Davis said he closed the marriage-license section of his office because of 'conflicting orders' from Moore and Granade. Davis said he will keep the section closed until he gets additional clarification, which could come Thursday. Granade has scheduled a hearing after Strawser and Humphrey asked the court to force Mobile County to issue same-sex marriage licenses. A second lawsuit filed by other couples against the Mobile County probate judge also names Moore as a defendant. Strawser said he hoped the Thursday hearing would settle the issue, once and for all. The case in Mobile only seeks to force that county's judge to issue the licenses. However, a lawyer for Strawser and Humphrey said she hoped Granade's decision would be 'instructive' to the other probate judges.","US District Judge Callie Granade ordered that Alabama courts must begin issuing marriage licences to gay couples on Monday .

"A bizarre list of more than 300 slogans used by North Koreans covering every topic from the misdeeds of the U.S. 'warmongers' to the cultivation of mushrooms has been revealed. The official KCNA news agency published the list, drafted by the ruling Worker's Party of Korea, on Thursday to mark the 70th anniversaries of its founding and the liberation of the Korean peninsula from Japanese rule. Political slogans are an intrinsic part of the relentless, daily propaganda formula that North Koreans are weaned on almost from birth. Scroll down for video . Devotion: A North Korean policeman stands near a wall of propoganda posters in the capital city of Pyongyang . North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un (centre) visits the construction site of an orphanage in Wonsan, Kangwon Province, on the east coast of North Korea . The tone of the 310 slogans, which ran to more than 7,000 words in translation and spanned two pages of the party's broadsheet newspaper, is by turns aggressive, encouraging, comforting and threatening, and the style ranged equally widely from the oddly poetic to the laboriously clunky. 'Make fruits cascade down and their sweet aroma fill the air on the sea of apple trees at the foot of Chol Pass!' was one agriculture-themed offering, followed by: . 'Let us turn ours into a country of mushrooms!' and 'Grow vegetables extensively in greenhouses!' Prominence was given to a long section of slogans hailing the legacy of late leaders Kim Il-Sung and Kim Jong-Il, and urging loyalty to the third generation Kim ruler, Kim Jong-Un. Others covered military strength, the economy, farming, science and technology, education, the arts and sports. The slogans shore up the internally propagandised image of the North as a racially pure nation that must make every effort to protect itself from scheming enemies - led by the United States - who are bent on invasion and enslavement. 'We were permanently buried by an avalanche of slogans,' said defector Lee Min-Bok who fled North Korea 14 years ago and now lives in the South. Propaganda: North Koreans pass a poster on a street in Kaesong, North Hwanghae Province, close to the border with South Korea . 'We had to memorise a lot of them to show our loyalty, but they slowly lost any meaning for anyone, especially after the famine in the 90s,' said Lee, 57. 'That greenhouse one has been around for decades. The problem is nobody had any plastic sheets of glass to build them, or fuel to heat them.' Some defector-run websites have run reports of how slogans have become the butt of private jokes among ordinary North Koreans who often amend them to reflect reality. The 1998 slogan 'Though the road ahead may be perilous, let's travel it laughing!' was changed to 'Let them laugh as they go, why are they making us come too?' But the slogans do offer some insights into the thinking and priorities of the North Korean regime, and a few ground realities are recognised. One of those published Thursday stressed the urgent need to increase food production, in order to 'resolve the food problem of the people and improve their dietary life'. Dear Leader: Prominence was given to a long section of slogans hailing the legacy of late leaders Kim Il-Sung and Kim Jong-Il, and urging loyalty to the third generation Kim ruler, Kim Jong-Un . There was a special section devoted to the evil misdeeds of the US 'warmongers' and another underlining the absolute necessity of maintaining a powerful military. 'Should the enemy dare to invade our country, annihilate them to the last man!' read one slogan in the military section, that also exhorted the wives of officers to 'become dependable assistants to their husbands!' The slogans also seemed to stress the country's eagerness to mend ties with their southern counterpart. 'It is a long-cherished desire of all the fellow countrymen and an urgent task of the nation to put an end to the tragedy of national division that has lasted 70 years,' one of the slogans read. The United Nations and human rights groups say North Korea is guilty of appalling treatment of many of its citizens, with defectors reporting mass-starvation, abuse and infanticide in prison camps. Poverty is rife outside the capital, which is home to about 2.8 million people. North Koreans are expected to worship their leaders past and present above any deity. Propaganda is pumped into the young minds of children from the moment they start kindergarten.","The list of 310 slogans was drafted by the ruling Worker's Party of Korea .

"Toys of characters from Disney's Frozen are selling at a rate of seven a second, figures from eBay reveal. After parents paid for DVDs, visits to sing-along screenings and specially-themed childrens' parties, youngsters are now pleading for Princess Elsa dolls and other toys linked to the film. On average, 12,623 Frozen items sell every day via eBay, outstripping all other brands of merchandise. Scroll down for video . Toys linked to Disney's Frozen are selling at the rate of seven every second on online marketplace eBay . The Japanese franchise Pokémon is the second most traded brand of toys on the site, followed by Harry Potter in third. Despite Frozen dominating the market, classic cartoons like Thomas the Tank Engine and Scooby Doo remain in the top 10. Thomas the Tank Engine  sells nearly 700 items each day via the site, while one piece of Scooby Doo merchandise is sold every hour. Spokesperson for eBay Laura Wilkinson-Rea said: 'Frozen has really captured the imaginations of an entire generation of children, and is a true phenomenon. 'It will be interesting to see if people are still buying or selling Anna and Elsa dolls in ten, or even 50 years time.' The film was released last spring and soon became the highest grossing animation in history . Soaring demand for Frozen merchandise over the last year has seen Disney's revenues grow by 20 per cent . The fact that the Frozen toys are now being widely sold on eBay also suggests that some children's enthusiasm for the film is beginning to flag and unwanted Christmas presents are now being sold on to others. 1.

"An 18-year-old former public schoolboy who shot primary school children with a BB gun to 'let off steam' has been spared prison. Jack Hewitt, of Gilmerton, Edinburgh, took potshots from a window of his parents' home at children aged between eight and 10 playing in the grounds of a neighbouring primary school. When he was arrested a tearful Hewitt told police he 'was letting off steam' during his exams. Former public schoolboy Jack Hewitt (pictured left) has avoided prison despite admitting to shooting at primary school children with a BB gun in May 2013 - he was instead ordered to carry out community service . He admitted culpably and recklessly discharging a firearm - but today avoided jail and was instead sentenced to 200 hours community service . Hewitt has twice had his sentence deferred - once to finish his exams and another to go on a charity trip to Fiji. During the May 2013 incident he shot at and hit a group of young children who were playing in the grounds of Gilmerton Primary School during their lunch break. Several of the children were hit by the pellets - one girl was struck on the forehead and another was hit just below the eye. Hewitt (pictured) has twice had today's sentencing deferred - once to finish his Scottish Highers exams and another to go on a charity trip to Fiji . Others had red marks and bruising on their arms, legs, stomach and heads. Today, a sheriff said Hewitt had an 'uncommon fascination' with firearms and had committed a serious crime when he fired at the children in Edinburgh in 2013. But after taking into account his previously clean record and guilty plea the judge ordered him to serve 200 hours of community service. Sheriff Isobella McColl ordered Hewitt to complete his community service over the next nine months. She said: 'I would have given you the maximum of 300 hours, but because you pled guilty it will be 200 hours.' She added Hewitt had 'an uncommon fascination, like other young people, with firearms'. After hearing a plea from Hewitt's defence lawyer for him to be admonished - the judicial equivalent of a verbal warning - the sheriff replied: 'Admonishment is impossible due to the seriousness of the offence.' But the father of one of children slammed the sentence and said Hewitt should have been jailed. He said Hewitt was getting off lightly because he had attended the £10,000-a-year George Watson's College in the city. He said: 'This young man was shooting at children. If he had hit one of them in the eye it could have been life-changing for them. 'He went to a private school and I think that is the reason why he got off lightly. Anyone else would have been sentenced a long time ago and not been let off to go to Fiji. This ten-year-old (pictured left)  was shot with a BB gun pellet in the arm (right) along with his friends . 'This was a chance to make a point about firearms but they have just let this person walk - it's ridiculous. 'He must have fired that gun loads of times which shows he had no remorse after hitting the first child. 'Since this happened we have been keeping an eye on similar cases and people have ended up in jail, which should have happened in this instance.' Outside court, Hewitt told reporters: 'I don't want to speak.' Scottish Conservatives previously criticised the delays in sentencing Hewitt. Today a spokesman said: 'We feel that the sentence is appropriate.' Former public schoolboy Hewitt was a student at the £10,000-a-year George Watson's College in Edinburgh .","Jack Hewitt, 18, shot at the primary school children from his window .

"More than a quarter of the public say that victims of rape or sex attacks are at least ‘a little bit responsible’ if they were drunk at the time. Among 16 to 19-year-olds, this leaps to one in three who believe people are partly to blame if they have been drinking. It then falls to fewer than one in four for people over the age of 25. Research by the Office for National Statistics also revealed that a fifth of victims of sexual assaults were unconscious or asleep. Three out of ten were ‘under the influence’ of alcohol. One in three teenagers said a rape victim's drunkenness made them 'completely', 'mostly' or 'a little' responsible . The study comes at a time of huge controversy over rape laws in the wake of the Ched Evans case. The Welsh international footballer was released from prison in October, halfway through a five-year sentence for raping a 19-year-old woman. Jurors had decided that a woman he had sex with was too drunk to consent. Last month, the row intensified further when the head of the Crown Prosecution Service, Alison Saunders, said society must ‘challenge’ the view that rape victims should be blamed if they had been ‘drinking’. Footballer Ched Evans was convicted of raping a 19-year-old after a jury found she was too drunk to consent . However yesterday’s ONS report – based on the Crime Survey for England and Wales, which questions thousands of people – found a sizeable minority did think that people who had consumed alcohol before they were attacked should shoulder some responsibility. Some 6 per cent said the victim is ‘completely/mostly responsible’ if they were drunk. A further 20 per cent said they were ‘a little bit responsible’. Two-thirds of respondents said the victim was ‘not responsible’ and 7 per cent didn’t know. Among those aged 25 to 44, around 23 per cent felt that a person who was drunk was at least partly responsible. For those aged 16 to 19, the figure was 33 per cent. Sarah Green, from the campaign group End Violence Against Women Coalition, said: ‘We already know that a significant minority of the population are inclined to blame women for being raped, but what should be a cause of great concern in these figures is the fact that younger people are more likely to blame women and girls for rape. ‘Young people today are bombarded with confusing messages about men and women and sexuality – women are constantly portrayed as sex objects and it is implied that it is ‘natural’ for men to pursue women to the point of coercion.’ The figures also showed that for over half of victims – 57 per cent – physical force had been used by the offender to try and make them have sex. One in ten victims reported that the offender had choked or tried to strangle them. A quarter reported that they had been frightened or threatened. Director of Public Prosecutions Alison Saunders suggested people accused of rape should have to prove how their alleged victim had consented . Overall, sex offences recorded by police rose to 64,205 in 2013/14 – the most since 2002/03 – and the ONS said there was a ‘greater willingness’ to report abuse. Experts added that the rise in reports was ‘thought to reflect’ better recording. At a special conference on rape last month, CPS head Mrs Saunders said people accused of sexual crimes must be able to show they had the person’s consent. ‘For too long society has blamed rape victims for confusing the issue of consent – by drinking or dressing provocatively for example,’ she said. ‘It is not a crime to drink, but it is a crime to target someone who is no longer capable of consenting to sex through drink.’","Shock findings published by the Office for National Statistics today .

The animal appeared in eight episodes of Friends, during the first and second seasons, along with her double Monkey. Sadly, David Schwimmer wasn't as much of a fan of his on-screen pet as his character Ross Geller was. ‘I hate the monkey,’ he told Entertainment Weekly in 1995. ‘I wish it were dead.’ David explained that he wanted to be able to get to know the animal, adding: ‘The trainers won’t let me bond with it. They’re really, really possessive. It’s like, “Land on your marks, do your job, don’t touch or bond with the monkey.” It’s a bummer. Big fan: The 19-year-old model, who was shot by Mario Testino, told the magazine that she loves animals . And Matthew Perry, who played Chandler Bing, told TV Guide: ‘The monkey doesn't know he's on TV. He isn't going to perform perfectly every time, so they're going to use the take where the monkey gets it right. ‘It didn't matter what our performances were like. If the monkey got it right on the first take, that was the one they used. The monkey also ate live worms. And then he'd vomit constantly.’ Katie and Monkey (born in 1988) additionally starred in Ace Ventura II: When Nature Calls, George Of The Jungle, Flinstones II: Viva Rock Vegas, Outbreak, Addicted To Love and Instinct. Not really Friends: Sadly, David Schwimmer said in 1995 that he 'hated' the monkey and wished 'it were dead' Animal A-lister: Katie went on to become the Rally Monkey for the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim baseball team . They also appeared in commercials for Bud Light, Diet Coke, Pepsi, McDonalds, Doritos, Sony and Yahoo. Katie later became the unofficial mascot, or Rally Monkey, for the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim Major League Baseball Team. The two capuchins are owned by Nerissa Politzer and were trained by Mike Morris of Bob Dunn’s Animal Service. Nerissa told People in 1995: 'If Monkey was human, she’d be Meryl Streep.'

The officers appeared to be frozen in place for an instant, with their guns still drawn, when the car finally came right up to the scene, the footage aired by Nine News revealed. As one policeman kneeled on the ground and rolled the woman's body onto its side, a male officer could be seen bending over with his hands on his knees before pacing slightly forward. Bending again even further and lowering his head, a female officer in front of him could be seen turning to face him as the unseen filmers hid their camera from view. Just before they finally drove off, the driver and his passengers captured a final glimpse of the scene. A second officer was filmed bending over the body as three more rushed to the scene, two of which had already begun putting on blue forensic gloves.

A witness who watched the confrontation between the woman and police unfold told Nine News that the 22-year-old repeatedly lunged at police with her 30cm blade. 'They tried to talk to her a little bit and she kind of lost it,' the witness, Ashton Tuimaseve, said. 'She started charging the male officer and the male officer was backing up looking like he was unwillingly not wanting to do anything. And then he fired one shot and it hit her in the chest. 'I think at the time she was being tazered and that's what might have slowed her down a little bit. Witness Ashton Tuimaseve said: 'there was two female officers comforting the male officer that did fire the shot' The woman was 'walking around with a large kitchen knife' and had been spotted 'running around the street earlier in Carnes Hill' when police were called, NSW Police Assistant Commissioner Frank Mennilli said .

Another witness, Robert Duncan, described the woman as moving towards the police 'in a zombie like fashion' while 'wielding and swinging a knife'. 'The woman came so close to one of the officers that he was going to be stabbed or had been stabbed and then I heard a pop sound and she went to the ground,' Mr Duncan told News Corp. Police reportedly spent time trying to revive the woman after she was shot . Witnesses described the woman as moving towards the police 'in a zombie like fashion' while 'wielding and swinging a knife' 'She could not have been tackled, the way she was running and swinging the knife it would have been impossible to get an arm or leg shot on her… she just kept coming as if she was possessed.'

A father, daughter and son who live across the road from Hungry Jack's - with their backyard backing onto Hoxton Park Road - told Daily Mail Australia they had a view of the whole thing. 'The girl was the only one outside. We think she was trying to hold up the petrol station. An incident happened near the service station last week. Policemen chasing the person but there were no shots that time,' Alan Sobbi, 45, said. 'My son said he saw something in her hand. We saw a group of police officers with some trying to revive her,' he added. Another witness, who did not want to be named, told Daily Mail Australia he had stopped his car 30 metres away and saw police shoot the girl. 'Basically I just saw a girl run away from the Hungry Jack's, servo area to the corner of Cowpasture Road,' he said. 'There were four or five officers basically running towards her and she was trying to run away and the copper just shot her in the stomach. 'She was surrounded by all four corners so the only way out was to run towards a cop anyway, it would have been a hard situation.'

A critical incident team from the State Crime Command's Homicide Squad will investigate the shooting .

I didn't see a big butcher's knife in her hand or her lunge at police.'

"A woman donated her kidney to a total stranger and they are now engaged after he proposed on Christmas Day. Ashley McIntyre, 25, discovered Danny Robinson, 25, was on dialysis treatment and was in need of an organ donor. She turned out to be the the perfect match in more ways than one. Ashley McIntyre and Danny Robinson became engaged after she donated her kidney to him . Miss McIntyre first found out about Mr Robinson from her mother, Kim, who heard his mother talking about his need for a kidney on a radio show . Speaking to the USA Today, she said: 'I never in a million years imagined this would happen...it was a whirlwind. It's crazy how it all worked. It was all planned out by God.' She added: 'I know being a living organ donor is not possible for a lot of people. But it's something to just think about. 'It's just kind of a human thing, something (to) do for another person that could change their life.' Danny's mother, Denise Stutzenberger, says even before she met Ashley, she was convinced her son would end up marrying her. 'I told her, ""You are going to be my daughter-in-law, you just don't know it yet,""' she said. 'I don't know how to explain it. Something in me told me.' Their story is also highly unusual for the fact only one per cent of living kidney donations are from strangers. On Christmas Day, he proposed and she accepted. The two are now expecting a baby in June . Overall in Kentucky last year, there were 135 kidney transplants, 33 involving living donors - so the couple's transplant was likely to have been one of the only live donations between strangers across the state. Miss McIntyre first found out about Mr Robinson from her mother, Kim, who heard his mother talking about his need for a kidney on a radio show. He had been diagnosed at 16 with IgA nephropathy, which occurs when an antibody lodges in the kidneys, causing inflammation that gradually damages kidney function. Family members offered to donate their kidneys but no one matched and so he spent two years on the transplant waiting list. The next day Miss McIntyre send a Facebook message to the radio show ('Terry Meiners & Co') and made contact with representatives from UK's transplant program. When the two were discharged from hospital, they remained close and started a romantic relationship after a Memorial Day family barbecue . She then underwent a series of tests and found they matched perfectly. When the procedure was 'almost set in stone', the two families agreed to meet at a Cheesecake Factory restaurant and they 'all clicked immediately'. Following that, Miss McIntyre and Mr Robinson, who are both from Louisville, Kentucky, chatted on the phone and regularly exchanged messages. Then in April she underwent the operations which went smoothly. It left her with one kidney and him with three — his two non-functional ones and hers working beside them. When the two were discharged from hospital, they remained close and started a romantic relationship after a Memorial Day family barbecue. On Christmas Day, he proposed and she accepted. The two are now expecting a baby in June and are hoping to buy their own place. 'It still doesn't register to me,' Miss McIntyre said. 'Before all of this [attention], we don't really think about our situation. We just live our daily lives. So to relive it all is kind of surreal, but it's awesome.'","Ashley McIntyre, 25, donated her kidney to stranger Danny Robinson, 25 .

"Weight loss expert Steve Miller believes that fat shaming is the best way to encourage people to lose weight and now he is encouraging people to tell their overweight loved ones if they're fat . From calorie-counting apps to old fashioned slimming clubs, there are plenty of ways to motivate yourself to lose weight. But would being called fat give you the final push you needed to shift the surplus pounds? Weight loss expert Steve Miller believes so and now he is encouraging people to tell their overweight loved ones they’re fat. The Fat Families star is sick of people branding ‘fat shaming’ as bullying and wants the nation to stop hiding behind political correctness. Steve uses what he calls 'constructive fat shaming' as part of his approach. Whilst some may find it offensive, he claims he’s built his success by telling clients' to their face that they’re fat and then working with them to develop an 80-20 regime whilst training them in self-hypnosis. Steve claims people are too scared to tell the truth, but if they want to help others avoid health problems and early death then it’s time to speak up. Despite many saying fat shaming is cruel, he claims that it can be a huge motivator to shed the excess pounds when done in the right way. As a straight-talking coach, Steve is regularly labelled ''nasty' for his blunt approach, but he says constructive fat shaming is an effective weight loss method. Steve, who calls himself the 'life b****', said: 'Whenever anyone discusses fat shaming, they automatically say it’s mean but this isn’t the case. In actual fact, fat shaming and telling people they’re overweight is a huge motivator. 'It’s about being constructive, you wouldn’t want a family member or friend to die early from health complications so if you can do something to help them, then you should.' Steve recommends using the word 'fat' constructively by speaking in a 'considered' tone. He also believes you should judge someone's eating habit rather than them as a person and remind them about the realities of being fat. 'Is it OK to be fat?,' he asks. 'It's OK as long as you remember that you're not going to live as long as your slim and healthy friends and relatives. It's OK to be fat unless you want to be able to lead a full, active life and play with your grandchildren. 'Remember, it's the slim and healthy people who pay for your treatment when your health fails. Why should we pay for your lack of self-control?' Tracey Howson, 34, weighed 19st and was a size 24, left, when she decided it was time to make a change. She followed Steve's programme and is now size 12 and weighs 12st . 'But really though,' he continues. 'You know it's not OK to be fat when every time you look in the mirror someone you vaguely remember as being you when you were slim says, ""Let me out you fat f*****. I've had enough"". Listen to your inner voice.' 'I’m tired of being labelled as nasty, I admit that I do tell people they’re fat but that is not bullying. I have worked with over 2,000 clients who have thanked me for being so direct with them because it gave them the motivation they needed. 'I myself used to be fat and if it wasn’t for me looking in the mirror one day and telling myself I looked awful, I would never have been motivated enough to lose weight or get to where I am today. 'As a nation, we need to stop being so frightened of it, if we felt someone close to us was drinking or smoking too much then we’d tell them. It’s the same with weight, obesity can lead to serious illness so we shouldn’t be scared to save our loved ones. 'I want to teach people how to use constructive fat shaming so they have guidance and support if they want to approach overweight loved ones.' Tracey, pictured with Steve, says that meeting him and following his approach was one of the best things she's done. 'He taught me that it's about changing your life as a whole and not just finding a short-term diet solution,' she said . One of his success stories is Tracey Howson, 34, who halved her dress size thanks to Steve. Tracey weighed 19st and was a size 24 when she decided it was time to make a change. Tracey, who had struggled with her size from a young age, joined WeightWatchers to help her slim down. Despite seeing some success from the diet, Tracey was unable to keep the weight off and soon began to pile the pounds back on. As a straight-talking coach, Steve is regularly labelled as 'nasty' and 'cruel' for his blunt approach, but he says constructive fat shaming is an effective weight loss method . She became a yo-yo dieter and soon after her marriage broke down, Tracey found herself at 19st again. The mother-of-two from Leeds knew an inflexible diet wasn’t enough for her to keep weight off in the long-term and sought help from Steve. Tracey bought his book, Get Off Your Arse And Lose Weight, and attended one of his seminars in Birmingham. She rapidly started losing weight by following an 80/20 approach rather than obsessing over her food intake. Before she knew it, she had lost three stone within the space of three months. Tracey shed seven stone in total thanks to Steve Miller’s approach and is now a healthy and stable size 12. His diet plan includes a fruit salad and apple juice for lunch, herby chicken, sweet potatoes and vegetables is on the menu with a wholegrain scone and strawberries for pudding. For dinner, Steve recommends a leafy salad with poached salmon. She said: 'I’ve struggled with my weight for as long as I can remember. I’ve always been big, even when I was at school. 'I joined WeightWatchers and lost weight but I soon realised that having to constantly monitor my food wasn’t going to work in the long run and I put it all back on. 'Meeting Steve and following his approach was one of the best things I’ve done. He taught me that it’s about changing your life as a whole and not just finding a short-term diet solution. 'I now eat healthily most of the time and really enjoy exercising and that’s something I never thought I’d say especially when I was at 19st. Steve doesn’t let you make excuses for yourself, which is great. I needed to be pushed into shape and that’s exactly what he did, he says it how it is and is so supportive. 'A lot of people do take up diets to lose weight, I’ve been there myself, but to keep the weight off you really need to be making lifestyle changes and that’s exactly what Steve teaches. 'I lost seven stone, it’s not been easy but it’s never felt like I’m on a diet. It’s about having everything in moderation and exercising regularly. I’ve never felt better.' The key here using my 80/20 regime is that you avoid living a life of denial. My clients reduce their calorie intake by making an improvement in portion control and also the quality of food but there is no rigid denial because they still eat a bit of what they fancy.

Such exercises can include: . • Walking . • Horse riding . • Zumba . • Swimming . • Salsa dancing . My message here is that the gym is often short-lived because people may become bored. I advise people to blend around 45 mins of exercise per day as well as embracing my 80-20 meal plan regime.","Steve Miller is encouraging people to tell  overweight loved ones they're fat .

"The Democratic National Committee announced on Thursday that it had selected Philadelphia as the site of its 2016 presidential nominating convention - a snub to New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, who had aggressively lobbied the organization to have the gathering in Brooklyn. In a statement explaining the decision DNC chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz specifically cited the City of Brotherly Love's 'commitment to a seamless and safe convention' and its 'deep rooted place in American history' as the reason the Pennsylvania metropolitan was chosen. The DNC had previously said the convention would take place the week of July 25, a month earlier than in the past, following the a Republican Party arrangement to have its convention the week prior in Cleveland, Ohio. Democrats have selected Philadelphia as the site of the party's 2016 national convention, choosing a patriotic backdrop for the nomination of its next presidential candidate. The convention will be held the week of July 25, 2016, a week after Republicans fete their nominee in Cleveland, Ohio . New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio had aggressively lobbied the Democratic National Committee to have the gathering in Brooklyn . Also on the losing end of the deal was Columbus, Ohio, a third site under consideration for the large-scale event. Philadelphia has hosted eight presidential nominating conventions, most recently in 2000 when Republicans formally picked George W. Bush as their nominee. New York City has also served as the backdrop for national party gatherings and was the location in 1992 in which Bill Clinton received his party's stamp of approval. Hoping to make history again, especially if Clinton's wife, Hillary, a former New York Senator is named the Democratic candidate for president, de Blasio had pushed the DNC party hard to have its conference in the Big Apple. The NYC Mayor has close ties to the Clintons and served as Hillary's campaign manager during her Senate bid in 2000. But Brooklyn, where de Blasio wanted to hold the event at the recently opened Barclays Center, is so far untested for an event of this size. And, the borough featured just 3,500 hotel rooms. Convention planners were looking for a location with roughly 17,000 rooms nearby. Had NYC been selected, most convention goers would have had to commute from Manhattan, clogging up the public transit system for the extremely populated city's residents. On a website making the case for why it should host Democrats' 2016 gathering, the city of Philadelphia said it could offer 16,726 rooms in close range. Brooklyn, where de Blasio wanted to hold the event at the recently opened Barclays Center, is so far untested for an event of this size . Philadelphia has hosted eight presidential nominating conventions, most recently in 2000 when Republicans formally picked George W. Bush as their nominee. Laura Bush, who would later become first lady, is pictured here at that year's convention at the First Union Center . New York City also had less cash on hand to put toward the convention, though it boasted more commitments, than Philadelphia. At the end of January de Blasio said his planning committee had $6.5 million and a total of $20 million pledges. Pennsylvania Gov. Ed Rendell, a former Philadelphia mayor, said he had $8.6 million cash on hand and $14 million promised. In 2000, the city ultimately brought in $63.7 million. Aside from logistical problems of the convention, de Blasio's rocky relationship with his city's police force was said to be a concern for Democratic Party officials. A source familiar with the situation told the New York Daily News committee members were 'worried about the optics' and that in selecting NYC as the host city the spotlight would be taken off the party's presidential nominee and put on de Blasio and the police. 'The way the mayor has handled the tensions in the city has raised the hurdle for New York City being chosen as the convention site. ... In all probability, it's a death knell for the city's chances,' a Democratic operative told the publication at the end of last year. Then- Arkansas Governor Bill Clinton and his wife Hillary are pictured here in April of 1992 campaigning in front of the Federal Hall in New York. New York City has served as the backdrop that year when Clinton received his party's stamp of approval. With Hillary now a probable candidate, de Blasio wanted NYC to again hold the Democratic National Convention . The NYC mayor is not well liked by certain law enforcement division in his city who allege that his behavior following the death of Brooklyn man Eric Garner at the hands of police and grand jury hearing of an involved officer helped incite violence toward cops there. A group of police turned their backs on him at a funeral honoring two fallen officers killed in the name of Garner when de Blasio spoke, and distrust between the mayor's office and members of the police force remains high. With the tagline 'Because it all started here,' Philadelphia had touted its history as the first Capitol City in the nation and the site of the signing of the Declaration of Independence as reasons it should be selected. It also played up its 'strong minority business community,' '130+' local labor unions and ability to provide adequate security for attendees of the gathering. Celebrating his city's good news today, Philadelphia Mayor Michael Nutter said in a statement, 'We believe that it was our proven track record of hosting big events safely and efficiently' in addition to the city's 'tremendous amenities, its accessible location and historical significance, which made Philadelphia the ideal choice for the 2016 DNC.'","New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio had aggressively lobbied the organization to have the gathering in Brooklyn .

"A woman has been arrested on suspicion of murder after a man in his 80s died at a care home. Police were called to Sowerby House care home in Thirsk, North Yorkshire yesterday afternoon after the man was found dead in his room. The woman, of Thirsk, was arrested late yesterday evening on suspicion of murder and is currently in police custody for questioning.

"Tesla boss Elon Musk is involved in a number of ventures - from electric cars to establishing a colony on Mars. Now the eccentric entrepreneur wants to create battery-powered homes. During an earning’s call, Mr Musk said the firm is going to unveil a Tesla ‘home battery’ - and it should start going into production by the summer. Elon Musk said his Tesla firm has designed a ‘home battery’ that is expected to go into production by the summer. He didn’t reveal how the battery would be used, but it could act as a generator during a power cut . It is likely to build on the power packs used in Tesla’s range of electric cars such as the Model S. ‘We are going to unveil the Tesla home battery, the consumer battery that would be for use in people’s houses or businesses fairly soon,’ Mr Musk told analysts. ‘We have the design done, and it should start going into production in about six months or so.’ The Mirai features the Toyota Fuel Cell System, which combines fuel cell technology with hybrid technology. The firm said it can serve as a 'high capacity power supply during emergencies'. The Mirai converts the DC power from the CHAdeMO power socket in the boot to AC power, using an attachment. Toyota calls it a vehicle-to-home system. Tesla's home battery could work in a similar way, or be a standalone battery. He didn’t reveal what a home battery would be used for, but it could act as a generator during a power cut, for example. As The Verge pointed out, rival car manufacturer Toyota already uses a hydrogen fuel cell in its Mirai car that can be removed and used to power a home. According to the Japanese car maker, the battery can supply electric power to an average home for a week. Last year, Tesla Motors unveiled plans for a $5billion ‘Gigafactory’ designed to help the firm ramp up production of batteries for its electric cars, and now homes. Tesla said the factory will cut current battery production costs by up to 30 per cent, and will be powered predominantly by renewable energy sources, such as wind and solar. The technology is likely to build on the power packs used in Tesla’s range of electric cars such as the Model S. ‘We are going to unveil the Tesla home battery, the consumer battery that would be for use in people’s houses or businesses fairly soon,’ Mr Musk told analysts during yesterday's earnings call .

Elsewhere, Mr Musk is already the chairman of SolarCity - a company that offers solar power systems for homes - and Tesla's home battery could be an extension of this. On the earnings call, Tesla also announced that during the fourth quarter of last year sales of its Model S vehicle fell short of predictions. The firm said it shipped a total of 9,834 sedans - 1,136 off the company’s 11,000 target. The man who invented the lithium battery (pictured) - which  powers almost every portable device on the planet - claims he is working on a super battery . The man who invented the lithium battery - which powers almost every portable device on the planet - claims he may have another  invention up his sleeve. Professor John Goodenough first demonstrated that lithium cobalt oxide could be used to create a rechargable battery capable of storing energy in 1979 at Oxford University. Now, aged 92 and at the University of Texas at Austin, he is working on a new type of 'super battery' that could change the way we use electricity. Professor Goodenough instead wants to use pure lithium or sodium metal as the negative electrode. This would, in theory, allow batteries to store 60 per cent more energy than current lithium ion batteries. That would also mean electric cars - which currently have a maximum range of up to 265 miles on a single charge - could make much longer journeys before needing to be recharged. It could also allow new ways to economically store power produced by renewable energy.","Elon Musk has announced the firm has designed a Tesla ‘home battery’

"In December last year, Amanda Hacche went on a day trip for work and for the first time ever she left her eight-month-old son Devon behind. When she returned from Auckland, New Zealand, to her hometown of Tauranga to collect Devon from a family member she noticed he was unsettled and seemed like he had a sore throat. For three days doctors insisted he had bronchiolitis, but Ms Hacche, 37, was unconvinced and when she took him to hospital three days later an X-ray revealed he had a lithium-ion battery lodged in his throat. Now 10 months old, Devon faces an uncertain future and months in hospital intensive care as Ms Hacche comes to terms with the fact he may never speak or breathe unassisted. Devon, now 10 months old, from Tauranga in New Zealand, swallowed a lithium-ion battery . His mother Amanda Hacche has to come to terms with the fact he may never speak or breathe unassisted . 'In the beginning it seemed so surreal, I kept thinking ""Is this really happening?""' she told Daily Mail Australia. 'And it's a process of the more you know, the more you realise how bad things are.' Ms Hacche said after she picked Devon up on the evening of December 15 - a Monday – he started wheezing as he breathed. Devon pictured before his horrific injury . 'The doctor thought he had bronchiolitis, and I did question that at the time, the wheezing seemed to not be coming from his lungs but almost in his throat,' she said. 'By Wednesday evening he hadn't improved at all, which I thought the medicine should have given him some improvement. 'We were given asthma medication to open up and relax his throat but I couldn't do it, it was too upsetting for me, he became too distressed using the spacer.' On Thursday morning Devon still hadn't improved so Ms Hacche took him to the emergency department at the hospital, where he was given an X-ray within 20 minutes. The X-ray revealed the battery in his throat, with subsequent tests showing it had caused major internal corrosive burns. 'When they're inside the body the acids, excretions and moisture amplifies the electric charge [of the battery],' Ms Hacche said. 'It increases the rate of corrosion so the battery is actually speeding up the process of tissue damage. 'While the battery had been lodged low in his oesophagus it had actually corroded the tissue right through and caused a hole in oesophagus right through to his trachea.' In addition an abscess formed with the laryngeal nerve – the nerve which controls his voice box – running right through it. 'We can't leave hospital, he can't breathe,' Ms Hacche said. 'It's been two months now, but we expect to be here a long time.' Devon has undergone three major operations and more than 30 other smaller procedures. An X-ray revealed a battery in his throat, with subsequent tests showing it had caused internal corrosive burns . In addition an abscess formed, with the nerve which controls his voice box running right through it . He is confined to his hospital bed, and can only sit up out of bed if he's held by a family member. This is particularly heartbreaking for Ms Hacche, who last year was watching her son meet all his milestones early. 'He was meeting them and blowing them away,' she said. 'He was pulling himself to standing. He started crawling at six months. 'He was saying words like ""Mama"" and ""Da"". ""Da"" was his favourite.' Ms Hacche has to be by her son's side every day and is now living at Auckland's Ronald McDonald house with her six-year-old daughter. She had spent years building up her own successful human resources and employment law business but has had to let her clients go to be there for Devon. With her main source of income gone, her sister has set up a fundraising page to help the family cover their living and medical expenses.

Devon is confined to his hospital bed, and can only sit up out of bed if he's held by a family member . But Ms Hacche said even more important than raising money was telling her story to spread a warning about the danger of batteries to other parents. 'I'm anally-retentive, vacuum cleaning, OCD tidier upperer,' she said. 'And these things are so prevalent in our homes, from kitchen scales to little bedside alarm clocks, car keys, digital remotes from iPod docking stations.' 'They seem so benign and that's the way we treat them but they're not they're incredibly dangerous.' Ms Hacche said battery wounds can be fatal within a few hours. 'We don't always have eyes in the back of our heads so it can happen to anybody and you've just got to be so aware of how dangerous they are,' she said. 'If our story shows one parent the dangers and saves one family from this journey to hell that we've been on and the tortuous situation for Devon and what it means for his future then it's worth it.'","Amanda Hacche's baby son Devon swallowed a lithium-ion battery .

"With its mixture of historic medieval towers, elegant Georgian townhouses and imposing Victorian structures, it is easy to see why Edinburgh is regarded as one of Britain's most beautiful cities. But one  local conservationist is calling for it to be stripped of its Unesco World Heritage status due to what he describes as a series of 'architectural blunders'. David Black, Chairman of the city's Southside Association is horrified by the way his beloved cityscape has changed in recent years and is compiling a damning report criticising planning decisions. Heritage site: Edinburgh was awarded Unesco status in 1995, but one local conservationist is so appalled by recent buildings he is compiling a damning report to send to the group's New York headquarters . Mr Black intends to send his report  to Unesco's New York HQ next month in a bid to have then strip the  city of the heritage status which was awarded in 1995. He told the Edinburgh Evening News: 'At the time [1995], Edinburgh was seen as a prime example of an old town and new town co-existing well. 'But since then we have seen one poor planning decision after another, from St Andrew Square to the Parliament building and Princes Street. 'This is not just some old fogey talking who doesn't like anything modern. I like the Festival Theatre, for example.' Eyesore: The Scottish Parliament building, opened in 2004, is an imposing structure of steel, oak, and granite . Another view of the Scottish Parliament which many believe does not fit in well with Edinburgh's historic buildings . A mixture of old and new buildings along Princes Street which Mr Black has criticised as a poor planning decision . Among the city's most criticised modern buildings are Appleton Tower, a 1960s eyesore next to the University and the new airport expansion recently named 'Scotland's Worst Building'. Mr Black said he is concerned at the plans to develop the area around Waverley Station and to transform the 190-year-old Old Royal High School building into a luxury hotel. The city's Unesco status is seen as an important draw for tourists and the city council is understandably keen to keep it. Britain currently has 28 sites on the  World Heritage List, including Westminster Abbey, the City of Bath, the Giant's Causeway, Stonehenge and a section of Liverpool's waterfront. If Mr Black is successful in convincing Unesco, it would not be the first time a city has been stripped of it's World Heritage Status. Monstrous: Appleton tower is a typical example of a 1960s housing block and often cited as one of Edinburgh's ugliest buildings . Carbunkle: The new expansion to Edinburgh airport was recently named 'Scotland's Worst Building' Concerns have been raised over plans to transform the 190-year-old Royal High School into a luxury hotel . In 2009 the German City Dresden was taken off the list after a four lane bridge was built just over a mile from the city limits. A spokesman for Unesco said at the time that the city had failed to keep its 'outstanding universal value as inscribed'. MailOnline has approached Unesco for comment regarding Edinburgh's status but they are yet to respond.","Chairman of Southside Association horrified at how cityscape has changed .

"A Florida home where a seven-year-old girl was lured, molested, and murdered five years ago was burned to the ground Thursday. Its been five years since seven-year-old Somer Thompson was lured into the home at 1152 Gano Avenue in Orange Park where she was molested and murdered by Jarred Harrell, 29. Little Somer disappeared in 2009 while walking home from school. Her body was found days later in a landfill. Harrell, who is now serving a life sentence, kidnapped, molested, and killed the seven-year-old in the house, the Clay County Sheriff's Office said. Scroll down for video . Posed for pictures: Diena Thompson, mother of Somer Thompson, center, stands with her daughter Abbey, 15, and son Samuel, 12, as family members and friends take photos as their house former burned in the final training fire in Orange Park, Florida on Thursday . Fire Gear: Here, Diena Thompson is seen in fire gear as she prepares to help firefighters set the final blaze to the home where her daughter was murdered in 2009 . Fire crews and other first responders used the house in a live training exercise after it was procured by the Somer Thompson Foundation. Now, the home that once sparked painful memories when Somer's loved ones passed by is destroyed. The home was burned down as part of a training exercise for the Orange Park Fire Department, Clay County Fire Rescue, and Jacksonville Naval Air Station Fire Department, WJXT reports. Participating firefighters started and extinguished small fires throughout the morning, according to WJXT, and the victim's mother, Diena Thompson, joined the firefighters at around 1.30pm and set the final blaze. 'How could you not feel good about burning down some place where unimaginable things happened?' Thompson said. Flames: Here, the home located at 1152 Gano Avenue in Orange Park is seen in flames .

The home was vacant after the 2009 murder, and ownership was later transferred from a bank to The Somer Thompson Foundation, founded by Thompson after her daughter's death, WFMY reports. Thompson reached out to the department looking for a way to use the home to benefit the community and destroy the home at the same time. She said she wanted something good to come from the tragedy, according to WFMY, and allowing firefighters to train at the house would be a good way to do it.

Memories: The home that once sparked painful memories when Somer's (right) loved ones passed by is destroyed . She donated the home to Fire Station 19. The specialized training included search and rescue techniques. On Oct. 19, 2009, Somer was walking home from elementary school with her twin brother and older sister when she became separated from the two and found herself in front of Harrell's home, The Florida Times-Union reports. 'She was literally just walking home one day and stopped right here and put her face up to the fence and talked to a little doggie,' Thompson told WJXT about the day her daughter was abducted. 'And then an even-meaner dog came out and took her.' Harrell admitted to abducting, sexually abusing, and lewdly touching Somer before strangling her, HLN reports. Investigators later revealed that Somer often played with a dog outside of Harrell's house, suggesting that he used the dog to lure the young girl into the home.

"Brian Williams career at NBC is effectively over after bosses handed him a six month suspension, according to industry experts . As anchor Lester Holt stepped in for Brian Williams on Wednesday night, it wasn't just the embattled NBC Nightly News host who was missing--his name was yanked from the show's opening title credit. Suddenly Nightly News with Brian Williams is simply Nightly News. What's more, while the show's website continued on Wednesday to bear Williams' moniker, Page Six reports the NBC veteran's name will be scrubbed from there, too. Meanwhile, Williams' career at NBC is effectively over after bosses handed him a six month suspension according to industry experts who predict that the former star anchor is unlikely to read a teleprompter for the network ever again. The beleaguered anchor was suspended without pay on Tuesday amid a firestorm of criticism over false claims that he was in a helicopter that was shot at during the Iraq War in 2003. Lester Holt directly addressed the controversy in Wednesday night's broadcast. He first reported statements made by NBC chiefs regarding Williams before assuring the audience, 'We will work every night to be worthy of your trust.' In his statement, NBC Stephen Burke chief executive wrote: . 'By his actions, Brian has jeopardized the trust millions of Americans place in NBC News. His actions are inexcusable and this suspension is severe and appropriate.' 'I know Brian loves his country, NBC News, and his colleagues. He deserves a second chance and we are rooting for him. Brian has shared his deep remorse with me and he is committed to winning back everyone’s trust.' 'We will work every night to be worthy of your trust': Williams' temporary replacement Lester Holt directly addressed the controversy surrounding the anchor on Wednesday night's broadcast . Something missing? The banner graphic for NBC Nightly News was wiped of Brian Willams' name starting Wednesday . But industry experts are predicting that it is unlikely Williams, 55, will ever return to his position as anchor and managing editor of the flagship Nightly News show. Williams’ credibility - and by extension that of NBC News - had been under fire for 11 days until his bosses handed out their swift and brutal punishment. Six months without pay means Williams has effectively been fined $5 million. The network's former star man hasn't commented publicly about his punishment which suggests that he isn't thrilled by his bosses' decision. 'He’s not going to read a teleprompter at NBC ever again,' television news analyst Andrew Tyndall told The Daily Beast. Williams' bosses NBC Chief Executive Stephen Burke and Deborah Turness, the president of NBC's news division, issued a joint statement on Tuesday night revealing that the anchor had been suspended . 'I’ve never heard of this kind of public announcement saying, ""We’re not paying you."" Whatever has gone on behind closed doors, they’re daring him to resign.' The severity of the punishment has lead some to speculate that the report being carried out into Williams had already uncovered enough damning evidence to make his position untenable. An NBC News veteran who spoke to The Daily Beast on condition of anonymity said they were ‘flabbergasted’ by the punishment. 'What NBC just did, by handing down this kind of six-month sentence, really prevents Brian from redeeming himself in any kind of expedient way. Don’t we agree that when you make a mistake, you correct it immediately, in the world we live in now? What is Brian going to do for the next six months?' Another option is that NBC simply do away with the Nightly News altogether, argues Michael Wolff in The Hollywood Reporter. ‘The affair exposes the entire make-believe aspects of Williams' job,’ wrote Wolff, who believes that the major networks can no longer compete with other sources of news. Weekend Nightly News anchor Lester Holt, right, who had stepped in this week is set to continue to substitute for Williams . Replacements? The network may consider Today’s Savannah Guthrie and NBC Sports anchor Josh Elliott as possible placements for Williams . ‘Network news, as has been evident for a generation, but never as starkly clear as now, is never going to be the network news again. It's finished. Finally. Take a breath.’ In a note sent to NBC staff, Deborah Turness, the president of NBC's news division, had described Williams' puffed-up retellings of events from 2003 as 'wrong and completely inappropriate'. Weekend Nightly News anchor Lester Holt, who had stepped in for Williams this week is set to ‘continue to substitute Anchor the NBC Nightly News,’ said Turness. Longer term the network may consider on-camera talent, such as Today’s Savannah Guthrie and NBC Sports anchor Josh Elliott, as possible placements for Williams. The scandal began on January 30, when Williams repeated an often-told anecdote about being on board a Chinook helicopter during the 2003 Iraq invasion. He said that he was on board a chopper which got hit by a rocket-propelled grenade and was forced to land. In fact, he was on a completely different helicopter. After being called out on the tall tale by veterans who objected to his glory-grabbing, Williams issued an on-air apology - and said he had been in a 'following' helicopter. This detail too came under scrutiny, and it emerged his chopper had been part of a different mission and was around half an hour behind. Boots on the ground: Williams, pictured above covering Iraq, was pulled up by veterans on an overblown story of being aboard a helicopter hit by an RPG - which it emerged he was not on at all . His plight worsened after other grand, personal stories - from Hurricane Katrina, Israel's 2006 war with Hezbollah, and even a childhood tale of being mugged - were also called into question. In her note, Turness wrote: 'We have decided today to suspend Brian Williams as Managing Editor and Anchor of NBC Nightly News for six months. 'The suspension will be without pay and is effective immediately.' 'While on Nightly News on Friday, January 30, 2015, Brian misrepresented events which occurred while he was covering the Iraq War in 2003. 'It then became clear that on other occasions Brian had done the same while telling that story in other venues. This was wrong and completely inappropriate for someone in Brian’s position. 'In addition, we have concerns about comments that occurred outside NBC News while Brian was talking about his experiences in the field.' Williams had just celebrated 10 years as Nightly News anchor last December, when he was also reported to have signed a $50 million contract for an additional five years. An advertising campaign – voiced by Michael Douglas – that touted his credibility as a reliable news source and featured clips of Williams in Iraq and during Hurricane Katrina was broadcast at the time. ‘It’s a thing that you build slowly, over time. It can happen during big moments. More often, it’s the day-to-day things,’ said Douglas. ‘And what you build, if you work hard enough, if you respect it, is a powerful thing called trust.’ Currently off the air after he admitted to lying about being hit by enemy fire in Iraq, a number of Williams' other seemingly outlandish claims are currently coming under increased scrutiny . Red Bank, New Jersey, 1970s . In a 2011 interview, Brian Williams recalled his time as a teenage volunteer firefighter during which he saved a puppy. However in a 2005 Esquire interview, Williams had claimed to save not one but two puppies. In the same Esquire interview Williams also revealed that he had been mugged at gunpoint while selling Christmas trees in the sleepy New Jersey town in which he grew up. A number of locals have questioned the credibility of his claim that someone ‘stuck a .38-caliber in my face'. Iraq War, 2003 . Over the years Williams has told multiple versions of a story about being in an Army Chinook helicopter during the Iraq War in 2003. Last month he claimed his helicopter was hit by ground fire, an allegation he was later forced to admit was false after an outcry from soldiers who were present. Williams issued an on-air apology and wrote on Facebook: 'Nobody's trying to steal anyone's valor.' Hurricane Katrina, 2005 . Williams has told several stories about his experiences reporting from New Orleans. He has claimed to have seen a dead body float past the window of his hotel in the city's French Quarter – even though the area wasn't flooded. The accuracy of other Katrina claims, including that he caught dysentery drinking the flood waters and that his hotel was ‘overrun’ with gangs, have been called into question by others who were on the ground during the disaster. Israel, 2006 . In a 2007 interview with Fairfield University Student Television, Williams recalled 'Katyusha rockets passing just underneath the helicopter I was riding in' during a trip to Israel. In fact he was nowhere near enemy fire and in a broadcast segment filmed that day he described rocket fire 'six miles away'. Boston, 2006 . A Navy vet accused Williams of lying to skip an event honoring members of the Armed Forces so that he could appear on Saturday Night Live. On the day of the Congressional Medal of Honor Society event the NBC News anchor told organizers that a 'pressing engagement' meant he wouldn't be able speak at the dinner, but later that evening he appeared in a walk-on role on SNL's Weekend Update.","Brian Williams career at NBC is effectively over after bosses suspended him, according to industry experts .

"Brusthom Ziamani - accused of planning a 'Lee Rigby-style' terror attack has denied a hammer, knife and flag he was carrying was a terrorist 'tool kit' that would be used to kill a soldier or politician . A teenager accused of plotting a 'Lee Rigby-style' murder has denied a 12in knife and a hammer in his rucksack were a terror 'tool kit'. Brusthom Ziamani, 19, was arrested in an east London street last August carrying the blade and hammer along with a black flag and had earlier researched the location of Army bases in the south east of the capital, a jury has heard. His Old Bailey trial was told that he turned to Islam early in 2014 and was arrested after he showed his ex-girlfriend his weapons, described one of Lee Rigby's killers as a 'legend' and told her he would 'kill soldiers'. After his arrest last year, Ziamani told a security officer that he had been on his way to kill a British soldier at an army barracks when he was stopped, jurors have heard. But at his trial today, Naeem Mian, defending, asked Ziamani whether the  flag, hammer and knife he was carrying could be correctly described as a 'tool kit' and he planned to use the flag once he had beheaded a soldier or member of the Government. The defendant replied: 'That's not what I was going to do.' Ziamani told the jury he was 'kicked out' of his home after his Jehovah's Witness parents found out that he had converted to Islam. Initially he turned to the Camberwell Mosque for help, before he fell in with members of an extreme group called al-Muhajiroun - or ALM - who gave him money, clothes and a place to stay. They invited him to a meeting in the basement of a Whitechapel halal sweet shop and then he went on demonstrations organised by the group. Talking about the discussion he had heard about  sharia law, he said: 'When I heard it, I thought it was extreme what they would do to someone when they steal or commit a sin. I did not share those views at all, what sharia law does. For example, a theft under sharia you have your hands cut off.' But the court heard that afterwards, he posted on Facebook: 'Sharia law on its way on our streets. We will implement it, it's part of our religion.' Asked why he did that, he said: 'I did not believe it. I wanted to fit in with these people because they were giving me places to stay and they did not like moderate Islam.' The jury have been shown the 12in knife found in Ziamani's back pack when he was stopped by police . He insists the knife and a hammer found on him were not going to be used in a terror attack on a soldier . At the time he was arrested in June last year on an unrelated matter, police found a ripped up letter in his jeans pocket in which he wrote about mounting an attack on a British soldier and expressed the desire to die a martyr. But he told jurors: 'I was ranting and raging about the situation in Muslim countries which was described in these talks. I did not believe it at all. I was ranting out of anger.' Ziamani told the jury that he did not disagree with what happened to Fusilier Rigby but he had told police that he would not do it himself. He went on to say that he carried the black flag with him because he could get texts to go to an ALM demonstration at short notice. The court heard after he bought the flag at one of the protests, he posted on Facebook: 'I have got my black flag. I'm going to rock it everywhere I go in the Kaffirs' face.' But the defendant, who had been a Muslim for just three-and-a-half months at the time of his first arrest, said he believed public preaching was the way to achieve sharia law in the UK. He denied styling himself as Mujahid Karim after one of Fusilier Rigby's killers, saying the Muslim first name meaning 'fighter, a warrior' suited his character because he used to do boxing and wrestling. Ziamani's lawyer put it to him that he would use the flag after he had committed the attack. He denied this . Ziamani said he was only 'ranting and raving' about extremism to fit in with a group who were offering help . Mr Mian asked: 'At any time were you planning a terrorist attack on military personnel or a member of the Government?' Ziamani replied: 'No.' Mr Mian had earlier told the jury: 'It's not illegal to be offensive. In fact only recently we saw heads of state in Paris marching to defend the right to be offensive in the wake of that atrocity that happened there. 'Our Prime Minister went there and said it's quite right people have this right. We have this right in this country. That's the beauty of rights - they apply to all of us. 'We have the right to be offensive. We all have the right to have an interest in gore and grisly stuff. We have the right to have undoubtedly repulsive views, some of which he has expressed. 'He is not on trial for his views. He is on trial because the Crown bring a charge to say that he was going to behead a British soldier despite the fact there is not one shred of evidence to show he carried out a reconnaissance mission and, you bet, if there was, they would know. Quite easily done.' The lawyer added: 'He is not on trial for the murder of Lee Rigby. He is not on trial for his opinions, as repulsive as you may find them.'

"Chimpanzees and bonobos are just as susceptible to the enticement of winning the lottery as their human cousins are. A study conducted by biologists at Duke University has shown that the primates - our closest living animal relatives - will choose to gamble food if they think they have a chance of winning more. However, if they are offered the same odds but believe they might lose, then they will be less inclined to play. A study conducted by biologists at Duke University has shown that the bonobos (pictured) will choose to gamble food if they think they have a chance of winning more. However, if they are offered the same odds but believe they might lose, then they will be less inclined to play . This is thought to be similar to the kind of economic biases - the hope of getting more despite the odds - that drive humans to play the lottery. In this case, the prospect of winning a life-changing amount of money makes people ignore the extremely high odds against them. However, if they are told that they are more than likely to lose the money they use to buy a lottery ticket or to place a bet, they are less inclined to take the risk. The researchers behind the study said that their findings could help to provide clues about the evolution of traits that make humans susceptible to marketing and spin. Chimpanzees have special 'words' that they use for different types of food and can even learn the calls used by strangers from foreign groups. Primatologists have found that a group of adult chimpanzees from a safari park in Holland adapted the grunts they produced for foods like apples to match those of other chimps they lived with in Edinburgh. Their findings are the first evidence that chimpanzees can learn calls referring to specific foods or objects. Many scientists have assumed that one of the defining features of human language is that objects and events can be named with different words or symbols depending on the culture. the researchers, whose findings are published in the journal of Current Biology, watched a group of adult chimpanzees from Beekse Bergen Safari Park in the Netherlands were moved to join a group of chimpanzees in Edinburgh Zoo. By analysing the acoustic structures of the calls they produced for apples, they found that the two groups of animals had different calls for the fruit before they were put together in 2010. While the Dutch chimps used high pitched grunts the Edinburgh chimps used far lower and softer sounds. After a year of integration, the grunt calls for apple were still different, but after three years the calls produced by the Dutch chimpanzees had changed to match those produced by those from Edinburgh. Christopher Krupenye, a behavioural biologist at Duke University who is the lead author of the study, said: 'People tend to prefer something more when you accentuate its positive attributes than when you highlight its negative attributes, even when the options are equal. 'The lottery is a good example of a context in which attribute framing can be very influential. 'Highlighting the five people who won 10 million pounds (the 0.00001%) will much more effectively encourage people to purchase lottery tickets than highlighting the 99.99999% who won nothing. 'Historically, researchers thought these kinds of biases must be a product of human culture, or the way we’re socialized, or our experience with financial markets. 'But the fact that chimps and bonobos, our closest living primate relatives, exhibit the same biases suggests they’re deeply rooted in our biology. 'That means it’s very difficult to overcome these biases, but it is possible to create environments that might help us make better choices.' The researchers, whose work is published in the journal Biology Letters, conducted experiments on 23 chimps at the Tchimpounga Chimpanzee Sanctuary in the Republic of Congo and 17 bonobos Lola ya Bonobo Sanctuary in the Democratic Republic of Congo. The apes were offered a choice between two snacks - a handful of nuts and some fruit. In one series of trials, the researchers framed the fruit option positively - by offering one piece of fruit, with a 50 per cent chance of a surprise bonus piece. In another series of trials, the researchers framed the fruit option negatively. This time they offered two pieces of fruit rather than one, but if the apes chose the fruit, half the time they were shortchanged and received only one piece instead. Chimps and bonobos were more likely to choose the fruit over the nuts when they were offered a smaller amount of fruit but sometimes got more, versus when they were initially offered more but sometimes got less - despite receiving equal average payoffs in both scenarios. The preference for the option framed as a prize rather than a penalty was especially strong in males, the researchers found. Dr Alexandra Rosati, a psychologist at Yale University who took part in the study, said: 'I think this might be similar to how people respond to playing the lottery or gambling. Kiki, a chimpanzee at Tchimpounga Chimpanzee Sanctuary in the Republic of Congo, was found to also have a 'glass half full' attitude when offered the right kind of reward that has implications for our evolutionary past . 'For example, if you think ""I have a 10 per cent chance of winning"" that sounds a lot better than ""I have a 90 per cent chance of losing"" - even though the situations are completely equivalent. 'The idea is that emphasising the positive attribute of you chance of hitting the jackpot makes it seem a lot more attractive than emphasizing the negative attribute.' This bias is the same as the kind of behaviour that sees people say they are more willing to recommend a medical procedure when they are told it has a 50 per cent chance of success compared to when it has a 50 per cent chance of failure. It is this subtle psychological difference that advertising executives have been taking advantage of for decades. Dr Rosati added: 'I think these primate studies can tell us a lot about human biases. 'When people make decisions that appear ""irrational,"" it is often not clear why. 'Perhaps people learned to respond that way due to socialization or culture. Perhaps the kinds of experiences we have as people who use money in economic markets causes this bias. 'But animals do not have these kinds of human-specific experiences - so when our closest primate relatives show the same ""irrational"" responses, that suggests that these economic biases have deep biological roots.'","Scientists at Duke University found apes are susceptible to positive 'spin'

"If Kim Kardashian and Beyonce have told us anything it's that big bums are big business. Now Debenhams is giving you the chance to enhance that all important asset with a pair of £45 bottom-boosting jeans. The new denims, designed by Jasper Conran, can add up to two extra inches to your derriere and have proved an instant success for the high-street chain. One woman's bottom looks compact in normal jeans (left) but the bum-boosting jeans (right) give the bottom a rounder and more lifted shape as makers claim the garments add two inches to the derriere . Bigger bottom: The model looks happy with her boosted bottom whilst trying out the Jasper Conran jeans . Indeed, the Shape Enhancing Jeans are said to be flying off the shelves, purchasing by women looking for a more shapely figure. It's a confusing turnaround for many long suffering partners as women trying on these denims and asking 'does my bum look big?' will no doubt be hoping for a resounding 'yes', in response. The innovative new jeans, which discreetly lift and boost behinds, were only introduced this week but already sales have exceeded expectations. The secret to the new jeans' success is a clever combination of cheek-enhancing cut, expert tailoring, and heavier denim strategically built in to give extra bulk and curve, turning a shapeless bottom into rear of the year. Control panels at the front also flatten the tummy to emphasise the effect, while the position of the darts in the denim give a flattering hourglass effect. The bottom line can be an extra two inches on vital statistics, as well as a significant 20 degree rise in overall curvature to the rear. Inspiration: Women are said to want to emulate the curvy bottoms of stars like Nicki Minaj and Kim Kardashian . Famous: Kim is well known for her famous bottom which she likes to show off in figure hugging clothes . The J by Jasper Conran lifting jeans are now available in all stores nationwide and online at Debenhams.com priced at £45 in sizes 8 to 18. The retailer is putting the early success down to the celebrity-led trend for bigger behinds proving popular with customers keen to emulate the look. 'Pictures of curvy famous women, from Kim Kardashian and Nicki Minaj, to Pippa Middleton and Carol Vorderman, have helped women with prominent rears realise they have a gorgeous fashionable asset to emphasise, rather than minimise,' said Debenhams spokesperson Lizzie Singleton. 'Of course it is a little more difficult for women with a slimmer, straight up and down silhouette. The only solution used to be an expensive gym membership and weeks of working out, but now buying a pair of shaping jeans can offer a wonderful, instant booty boost.'","Debenhams now stocking the Jasper Conran Shape Enhancing Jeans .

"Ed Miliband was under fire last night over a ‘sickening’ suggestion that the row over Tory links to tax avoidance could be another ‘Milly Dowler moment’ to be exploited for political gain. The toxic claim was made by one of the Labour leader’s most senior aides, as Mr Miliband tried to drive home his efforts to link Tory donors to the tax avoidance scandal involving clients of HSBC’s Swiss private bank. Labour last night said the exact phrase ‘Milly Dowler moment’ had not been used, and said the only comparison between the issues was the way they had ‘crystallised’ public opinion. Scroll down for video . The Labour Party was accused last night of exploiting the murder of Milly Dowler, left, for political gain after a senior aide to Ed Miliband, right,  claimed the Tory tax row could provide another Milly Dowler moment . But critics said it was astonishing that Labour saw any link between the two and called for the aide involved to ‘resign immediately’. Mark Lewis, a solicitor who represented the Dowler family over phone hacking, last night condemned the intervention. He said: ‘It is rather inappropriate that someone would regard the hacking of a murdered schoolchild as a political opportunity rather than the tragedy it was.’ Tory MP Mark Garnier, a member of the Commons Treasury committee, described the comparison as ‘sickening’. He said: ‘I am genuinely shocked that anyone would make such an utterly distasteful and revolting comparison.’ The row erupted after BBC political editor Nick Robinson posted a message on Twitter saying: ‘The Labour leader’s aides say that he sees this as another Milly Dowler moment.’ Mr Robinson later stressed the comment – which emerged from a lunch with Mr Miliband’s chief spin doctor Tom Baldwin – was not a direct quote. A Labour spokesman said: ‘An official talked about how the news story on Milly Dowler crystallised what a lot of people thought about the Press. ‘And this tax avoidance story on HSBC crystallises what a lot of people thought about tax avoiders. The words “Milly Dowler moment” never cropped up.’ Tory MPs last night urged the Labour leader to sack Mr Baldwin, a former journalist. Philip Davies said: ‘Tom Baldwin, like his mentor Alastair Campbell, represents the ugly underbelly of Labour. ‘Baldwin’s actions are utterly unforgivable. He should resign immediately.’ Mr Baldwin declined to comment. Mr Miliband claimed the row with former Conservative treasurer Lord Fink was 'a defining moment' in the general election campaign . The controversy overshadowed the row between Mr Miliband and the former Tory treasurer Lord Fink over his tax affairs. On Wednesday, Lord Fink challenged the Labour leader over claims that he was involved in ‘tax avoidance activities’ after he was named as one of the clients of HSBC’s Swiss private bank. Mr Miliband also appeared to suggest Lord Fink was a ‘dodgy’ donor. Lord Fink challenged Mr Miliband to repeat the claims outside the Commons – where he has protection from libel laws – saying he would sue him for defamation if he did. In a partial climbdown yesterday, Mr Miliband said he did not consider Lord Fink to be ‘dodgy’. Grocer's son who made £180 m - and gave away a fortune writes ANDREW PIERCE . Lord Stanley Fink  at the  Savoy Hotel, in London . He lives in a mansion in North London, owns a villa that he built and designed on a vast estate in Spain, and has a five-star hotel in the swish ski resort of Courchevel in France, complete with a dozen luxury apartments. Oh, and he’s worth £180million. Little wonder that Ed Miliband, the son of a Marxist, saw Lord Fink’s riches and the revelations about his tax affairs and his account with the Swiss bank HSBC as the opportunity of a political lifetime. So who exactly is Lord Fink? Where does his money come from? And how great is his influence in Tory circles? He is known as the Godfather of hedge funds after turning a humble commodities firm called the Man Group, which sold rum to the British navy, into the biggest fund in the world with assets of £80billion. He became chief executive of Man in 2000, successfully catching the rapidly-rising hedge-fund tide, and has given the Tories millions of pounds. A classic Conservative rags-to-riches success story, Fink, 57, is the son of a Manchester grocer who made money on the side by selling his own range of lampshades. He is the most successful of his siblings – one of his brothers trades computer parts from a garage, the other is a middle-manager for a car windscreen company. Fink went to Manchester grammar school and studied law at Trinity College, Cambridge, from which he entered the City working in accountancy firm Arthur Andersen and then Mars, before turning Man into the largest listed hedge fund company in the world – and the biggest money-making machine in the City for decades. He enjoys the trappings of success. His Alpine hotel, he says, ‘is the best of both worlds, having a private house with a Michelin chef. I go to the hotel bar and use the pool and the gym.’ The father of two grown-up sons and a daughter, he met his wife Barbara when they were both volunteers in an old people’s home. For their 25th wedding anniversary in 2006 he flew 200 of his family and friends to Spain. Each guest received a suede mock-up passport that opened up to reveal pictures of the happy couple through the years. He chartered two planes for a three-day party with the stipulation that the only bags allowed in the luggage hold were to be Prada, Gucci and Louis Vuitton. The celebration took place in the Ronda mountains behind Marbella on La Zagaleta estate, one of the world’s most exclusive golf clubs, which he owns. Fink has described the location, with its views to the Mediterranean, as ‘a place as close to paradise as I have witnessed’. His screen saver on his computer in London is a view of the La Zagaleta golf course. Prime Minister's Questions became so heated yesterday the Commons Speaker John Bercow was forced to intervene . But despite the riches, life has not been plain sailing. In 2004 he was diagnosed with a benign brain tumour after he suffered a mild stroke while on safari in Botswana with his family. He had been struck dumb midway through a sentence. The tumour required immediate surgery and he spent three months recovering. A passionate champion of the NHS, after one of his children had been dangerously ill he raised millions of pounds for Evelina London Children’s Hospital which opened in 2005, the first purpose-built children’s hospital in London in 100 years and a landmark in paediatric medicine. ‘A sick child is a sick family,’ Fink said of his decision. After his own health scare he quit Man Group in 2007. The following year he surprised the City when he returned with a new hedge fund, ISAM. An even bigger surprise was his choice of business partner – Lord Levy who was Tony Blair’s financial fixer for more than a decade. Levy was so successful at raising money for Labour he was dubbed Lord Cashpoint. Fink can, of course, always seek advice from Levy – who himself was accused of avoiding tax – over his current fix. When Blair was accused of selling honours for cash, Levy was twice interviewed by the police. No action was ever taken. Fink’s new hedge fund has offices in Australia, Dubai, New York and the tax- friendly Cayman Islands, and assets of more than £1billion. Unlike Levy he has always been a passionate Tory. He became a Tory after working as a student in a paper factory in Bury. While there, he developed a new method of generating more orders for the company. After a couple of days he was taken aside by a trade union shop steward and told this was ‘very unhelpful because there were people who weren’t able to pick orders at quite the same rate’. Fink was appalled. ‘It was a great shame because clearly my way was better for the company,’ he said. ‘I saw a negative side of trade unions. That hardened my views.’ Having served for two years as Tory treasurer, Fink was made a peer by David Cameron in 2011 and has been his guest for dinner at Chequers. A noted philanthropist, he gave £2million to education charity ARK – or Absolute Returns for Kids – to fund Burlington Danes City Academy in White City in West London. But he is happy to speak his own mind. When in 2012 George Osborne tried to stop the rich from enjoying tax breaks by making donations to charities, Fink led the opposition. It was unprecedented for a Tory treasurer to publicly denounce a Conservative Chancellor but Fink did so, and it was a decisive intervention. Within days Osborne had backed down.","Ed Miliband thinks row over tax dodging makes him appear on voters' side .

"Taxpayers paid out more than £2,300 a month for a council chief executive Bryn Parry-Jones to drive around in a luxury Porsche, it was revealed today . Taxpayers paid out more than £2,300 a month for a council chief executive on a £195,000 a year salary to drive around in a luxury Porsche, it was revealed today. Chief executive Bryn Parry-Jones' high-powered office car was leased at more than £28,000 a year, and funded by taxpayers in Pembrokeshire. Then, the cash-strapped council had to pay £8,600 to end the hire contract on the Porsche Panamera when Mr Parry-Jones, 62, quit his post last October. The highest earning council boss in Wales had the sleek £90,000 Porsche leased for him while earning a salary of £195,000 plus benefits, earning him more than the Prime Minister - who is paid £142,500 a year. The car, a favourite of popstars and professional footballers, cost the council a further £2,368 a month - and over the course of the year added up to more than the average annual salary of £26,500. A graduate nurse is paid around £21,000 a year, while a newly qualified teacher would be on a starting salary of £22,000. Last month, Pembrokeshire Council was ordered by the Information Commissioner to reveal the full cost of the hire car within 35 days. A local councillor then revealed that ending the lease agreement ahead of schedule had cost £8,670. The council has confirmed this figure was correct. Mr Parry-Jones was handed a £280,000 golden goodbye, despite the fact he had been forced to quit over a suspected unlawful payments scandal. Details of his car only emerged at the start of December after a long Freedom of Information battle with the council. Insiders said the extravagant expense had 'stuck in the craw' of cash-strapped council workers who knew about it for months. Campaigners and politicians hit out at the 'offensive waste of money' at a time when the council was making cuts to local services. Last year, Pembrokeshire Council revealed it would have to make savings of £20million over two years. Proposed measures include closing public toilets, charging for social services and increasing parking fees. Council tax rose by 3.4 per cent this year. The highest earning council boss in Wales had the sleek £90,000 Porsche Panamera leased for him while earning a salary of £195,000 plus benefits . Paul Miller, who leads the opposition Labour group on the Independent-controlled council, said: 'Why a council chief executive needed a Porsche is completely beyond me. 'It's an absolute disgrace, the way he used to operate that council was outrageous. 'He was a dictator and it got to the point where he thought he could do whatever he wanted and it was council tax payers who footed the bill.' Mr Parry-Jones came under pressure to resign from his post after it was revealed he had taken cash payments which the Wales Audit Office said were unlawful. The payments to Mr Parry-Jones were investigated by police, who later decided there was no evidence of wrongdoing, and no further action should be taken.

"Currently the only way of spotting cars on dark country roads is by their lights. But Nissan has trialled technology that means cars could glow-in-the-dark  on the roads to become more visible. The Japanese car manufacturer has become the first  to apply UV absorbing paint on a production car. Scroll down for video . Nissan has become the first car to manufacturer to apply UV absorbing paint on a production car.

The ‘ultraviolet-energised paint’ on the Nissan Leaf electric car is a demonstration of a secret paint formula made up of organic materials. Known as Starpath, the paint is applied by spraying and absorbs UV energy from the sun throughout the day. It is able to glow for between eight and 10 hours when the sun goes down. The paint is the brainchild of Surrey-based inventor Hamish Scott, who is already trialling glow-in-the-dark cycle paths in Cambridge.

It’s made from very rare earth materials, including Strontium Aluminate, which is solid, odourless and chemically and biologically inert. However, the paint option won't be a choice for future customers because the ingredients mean it is unlikely to be used on a large scale. People can, however, have the treatment applied to their own car or buy UV car ‘wraps’ to enable their car to glow-in-the-dark. This would enable them to find their car easily in a dark car park, as well as making them more visible on pitch black roads. Nissan told Autoexpress that if the paint was ever offered, the glow would probably last for around 25 years. The experiment was done to showcase the increasing number of Leaf owners who are charging their cars using solar energy. Nissan says its eco-friendly car costs less than two pence per mile to run and that 89 per cent of Leaf owners in the UK charge their cars at home overnight. The paint option won't be a choice for future customers because the ingredients in the paint mean it is unlikely to be used on a large scale. However, glow-in-the-dark cars could prove useful for making vehicles extra visble on dark country roads (pictured) A trial of the Starpath technology is under way in Cambridge city centre, where a spray has been applied to cyclepaths to make them glow. The luminescent, rain-resistant coating could one day replace street lights. It is applied in three layers, with a middle aggregate stage that absorbs UV energy during the day, which is then released as a blue glow when it's dark. The system uses polyurethane base and a polyaspartic topcoat that seals the whole thing together. According to the Pro-Teq Surfacing, the company behind the technology, it can be applied to almost any solid surface including tarmac, concrete and wood. Unlike those glow in the dark stars you used to stick on your walls, Starpath reacts to varying levels of ambient light. ‘This product adjusts to the natural light, so if it is pitch black outside the luminous natural earth enhances,’ said Mr Scott, who owns the firm. ‘If the sky is lighter, it won’t release as much luminosity – it adjusts accordingly, it’s almost like it has a mind of its own.’ Nasa has teamed up with car manufacturer Nissan to develop new self-driving cars that could be used to race across the surface of Mars. The technology created during the five-year partnership will also be adapted to create better driverless vehicles that can be used on roads on Earth. Robotics experts from the space agency will work with engineers from Nissan to adapt the company's electric Leaf cars. Future rovers on Mars could look more like Nissan's Leaf electric cars (pictured) as the automobile manufacturer is to develop technology jointly with Nasa to create self-driving vehicles that could be used on Earth and in space . Nissan has pledged to have autonomous cars on the market by 2020, but the technology currently faces significant challenges to cope with the dangers of public roads. However, Nasa believes sensors and systems being developed to help driverless cars deal with pedestrians, cyclists, overtaking vehicles and parked cars, could also help to develop new robotic rovers for use in exploring other planets. t is not the first project that Nasa and Nissan have collaborated on. In 2005 the two organisations teamed up to develop more comfortable and safer car seats. Nissan drew upon data from Nasa's Human Research Program at its Johnson Space Centre that had used experiments from space to examine the neutral body position of astronauts while they were sitting in low gravity. Nissan used this to build seats for its cars that would lower the amount of fatigue drivers would feel and reduce pressure spots.","Nissan is first car maker to apply UV absorbing paint on a production car .

"When Kim Kardashian bared her derriere on the cover of Paper magazine in an attempt to 'break the internet', the reality TV star created a frenzy. It is just one of many recent magazine images that show the 34-year-old flaunting her giant backside, each one more compromising than the last. But while many have been horrified by Kim's bare bum in the media, it turns out that it is nothing new - as Stylelite points out, bottom-flashing  has been a fail-safe marketing tool for nearly 60 years, selling anything from beauty products and magazines to albums and fashion. From The Coppertone Girl in 1959, left, to Kim Kardashian's infamous Paper magazine shoot last year, right, the bottom has a long history been used as a marketing tool . Long before the curvy Kardashians appeared on the scene, there was the Coppertone Girl. In 1959, the suntan lotion advert featured a three-year-old girl on the beach trying to pull her pants out of her dog's grip, with the taglines,  'Don't be a Paleface!' and 'Tan - Don't Burn.' The little girl in the illustrations was based on drawings of Cheri Brand by her mother Joyce Ballantyne Brand, was also famous for sketching the Pampers baby in 1977. But little did Joyce know then, how dominant bottoms would become in advertising, as well as popular culture. The Motor Show At Earls Court London in 1971 used two bottom baring models to promote new vehicles . But it wasn't until a decade later, in the 1970s, that rear-ends began to be used prolifically in advertising. In 1971, The Motor Show At Earls Court, west London, combined two of men's favourite things: cars and women, by using two bottom-baring models, Susan Shaw And Helen Jones, to promote new vehicles on display. Even serious financial institutions were at it - in 1978, TSB bank used a bikini-clad lady analysing her bottom in a mirror to promote their travellers cheque service. In 1978, TSB bank used a bikini-clad lady analysing her bottom  to promote their travellers cheque service . Perhaps the best known behind from the decade though, was on the famous Athena poster. When Fiona Walker, a freelance illustrator, was snapped flashing her cheeks on the tennis courts at the University of Birmingham by her boyfriend, the then-unknown 29-year-old commercial photographer Martin Elliot in 1976, she could never have imagined how popular the image would become. It has now sold more than two million copies internationally and been recreated by superstars such as Kylie Minogue and Ricky Gervais. The couple split in 1979, three years after the photo was taken and while Fiona was never officially paid for the shot, Martin always said: 'I looked after her.' Fiona Walker, 53, poses with a picture of herself as the eighteen year-old 'Athena tennis poster girl' from 1976 . The next significant moment in the derriere's part in pop culture came in 1984, with the picture of Bruce Springsteen's pert denim-clad behind on the cover of Born In The USA. Shot by top photographer Annie Leibovitz, critics said the singer, nicknamed 'The Boss', only became a music icon after working out and showing off his new gym-toned rear on the album cover. In 1992, rapper Sir Mix A Lot released his tribute to big bottoms, the Baby Got Back album. The cover featured the artist standing on a giant bottom and the song, with its shameless lyrics, was so controversial that it was banned from MTV. The following year, in 1993, Benetton, well known for their powerful advertising campaigns, used a close-up of a bottom with a tattoo that read 'HIV positive' to raise awareness of AIDS. Sir Mix A Lot’s Baby Got Back album cover in 1992 showed him standing on a pert derriere . In 1994, the BBC comedy The Fast Show started with a character created by Arabella Weir who always asked, 'Does my bum look big in this?' The focus wasn't just on women's behinds though - in 1995, the pop star Robbie Williams posed up in a pair of white skimpy briefs, complete with back wig and high heels for 7-Up ad campaign. But the small tush tide was about to turn. By 2000, pop stars were using their bottoms to promote their music - and bigger was fast becoming better. Jennifer Lopez took curves into the mainstream when she had a global hit with Jenny from the Block. The singer was enormously proud of her large backside and instead of dressing to make it seem smaller, she actively sought out clothes that enlarged her bottom. In 1993, Benetton used a snap of a bottom with a tattoo that read 'HIV positive' to raise awareness of AIDS . Robbie Williams posed in pair of women's briefs in a 1995 7UP advert . But it was the rapper Nicki Minaj who really got tongues wagging after she revealed her ample curves in a tiny pink thong. Her  explicit Anaconda video firmly proved that we are in the era of the rear end. Styled as an Amazonian goddess, Nicki kicks off the Da Internz and Polow Da Don-produced video by standing on a bamboo platform surrounded by four bikini-clad back-up dancers. The tropical-themed tune was guaranteed to get pulses racing with its cut-away shots of jiggling bottoms, including one of the dancers twerking while doing the splits. Spoof versions of the cover quickly followed. Sydney boy Shane Jenek, who goes by the onstage persona of Courtney Act, uploaded a spoof version with her head superimposed on an exaggerated version of Minaj's body and booty. Nicki Minaj's Anaconda  cover caused quite a stir when it was released last year . The controversy courting the artist roused a variety of reactions from the industry, with fellow pop star Katy Perry commenting: 'I wanna take a nap on dat pillow doe @NICKIMINAJ'. But others labelled it 'overly explicit,' causing The Beauty And A Beat hitmaker to respond that the pose  was no more 'unacceptable' than similar images of white models. To prove her point, the BET Award winner posted several images of Sports Illustrated models, including Kate Upton, striking poses that were equally racy. In fact, the men's magazine has long used scantily-clad women on its covers. Sport's Illustrated magazine has long used scantily-clad women on the cover, including Nina Agdal, Lily Aldridge and Chrissy Teigen, centre, and Kate Upton, right . It included models Nina Agdal, Lily Aldridge and Chrissy Teigen wearing skimpy bottom-baring bikinis in the Cook Islands on the magazine's 50th anniversary cover last year. Not long afterwards, Jennifer Lopez attempted to steal back the limelight for her bottom by releasing a song called Booty with rapper Iggy Azalea. The cover for the track featured the two females baring their famous bottoms for the camera. The song, which is a remix of Lopez's original, had an equally raunchy music video filmed to go with it. Jennifer Lopez and Iggy Azalea released an aptly-named song, Booty, and bared their bottoms on the cover . The duo could be seen gyrating in revealing swimming costumes and being soaked with water. It isn't only singers and models using their bottoms for promotion though. In 2011, it was announced that Britain's female beach volleyball champions were renting out their rears in an advertising deal that encourages spectators to photograph their behinds. Zara Dampney, 24, and Shauna Mullin, 26, inked a deal where they would wear bikini briefs with a Quick Response (QR) code printed on the back where it will catch the eye of spectators.

"A woman who shot dead an off-duty policeman before turning the weapon on herself had previously tried to sue a traffic officer. Otto Thomas rang 911 after she gunned down Larry Tuttle and told the operator she had killed her boyfriend as he was allegedly about to hit her again. The 42-year-old then blasted herself as police surrounded the officer's home in Dallas, Texas, and urged her to give herself up. It has been revealed that Thomas had previously filed a $1 million lawsuit against another officer for blowing kisses at her in a traffic stop in November 2012, according to WFAA.com. Otto Thomas, 42, rang 911 to report that she had shot dead off-duty police officer Larry Tuttle, 40, at his home in Dallas, Texas . Records at Bexar County Court show that Thomas unsuccessfully tried to sue Universal City, its police department and Officer Corey Vullo, the website reported. She alleged that Officer Vullo made inappropriate sexual advances towards her after pulling her vehicle over and on an online dating website. Officer Vullo denied the allegations and the case was dismissed last year, WFAA.com reported. Thomas called 911 around 6:15pm on Saturday to report that she had shot dead 40-year-old Officer Tuttle and needed his colleagues to come and pick up her six-year-old daughter. She told the operator: 'He was getting ready to hit me again and I just went off. I killed him because he was going to hit me again.' Officers  have not found any evidence at the scene that supports Thomas' claim. Left behind: SWAT teams stormed Tuttle's apartment and found the couple dead, with Thomas' 6-year-old daughter uninjured in a bedroom . When they arrived at the scene they ordered the Thomas to drop the weapon and leave the apartment. Moments later a gunshot was heard from inside the building. SWAT teams swarmed the apartment and found the couple dead, with Thomas' young daughter uninjured in a bedroom. Her daughter, who neighbors say is autistic, has been transferred to the care of Child Protective Services, which are trying to get in contact with Thomas' family in Mississippi. Police say there have been no prior disturbance or domestic violence calls to the apartment. Tuttle's wife Kandie Morgan told KXAS- TV that they had been separated for a few months, and that he had been a great father to their 10-year-old son. Police are unsure whether Thomas was living with Tuttle at the apartment. They say she recently lived in an apartment in Arlington.","Otto Thomas shot dead off-duty officer Larry Tuttle in Dallas, Texas .

"His smart cream shoes dusted of desert sand, the Prince of Wales continued his tour of Saudi Arabia with a traditional sword dance at a Bedouin camp last night. Standing with his knees bent and feet shoulder-width apart, the heir smiled alongside local men as they jolted scimitars in the air, swaying from side to side. And while his navy blazer and beige chinos were a far cry from the flowing robes and headbands of those standing beside him, the Prince tried his utmost to fit in with locals at the camp found near the town of Onaizah. Scroll down for video . Prince Charles took part in a traditional sword dance during a visit to a Bedouin camp near the town of Onaizah on his tour of Saudi Arbia . Public executions, most often in the form of beheading, are commonplace in Saudi Arabia which observes Sharia law. Stoning is reserved for those found to have committed adultery with those sentenced to sedated before being killed. With ceremonial daggers in their waistbands, the men looked like fearsome warriors as they made space for the future king when he was led over to them. Earlier in the day Charles was seen sporting a dapper cream suit and black sunglasses. The 66-year-old looked every inch the stylish traveller as he struck a pose outside the remains of the ancient city of Al-Ula. With him was Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince, Sultan bin Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud, who in 1985, became the first royal to venture into space. Not the first time: Like his son Prince Harry, Charles has previously taken part in Omani sword dances . En garde! Charles gamely took part in a traditional sword dance with a group of local tribesmen . Charles swayed from side to side, keeping his sword aloft as he took part in the dance last night . Yesterday's visit was considerably more down to earth, with the two royal princes taking in a clutch of historical sites. Charles also had to deal with a choking desert dust storm, which although uncomfortable, appeared to leave him unfazed. The swirling clouds of dust had given his private jet a bumpy landing, as he later told Prince Sultan while they boarded a tourist coach to the first site. Charles' first stop was at Al-Khuraibah, the ancient capital of the Kingdom of Lihyan where 6th century tombs are carved into the side of the mountains. As the two princes walked to the archaeological site, another small dust storm sprang up and engulfed the entourage of the two princes briefly. Charles, who was asked to pose for a picture, joked with photographers: 'Do you mind if I keep my sunglasses on the dust will get in my eyes.' They then travelled on to Mada'ain Saleh, a place of pilgrimage for Muslims, that was originally built by the Nabataean people, who also created the ancient city of Petra in Jordan. Formerly known as Hegra, it boasts well-preserved monumental tombs with decorated facades dating from the first century BC to the first century A.D. The site also features some 50 inscriptions dating from the pre-Nabataean period and some cave drawings which are evidence for human settlement as early as the third or second century B.C. Warm welcome: The heir was showered with flower petals as he entered the old town of Ala Ula last night . A Saudi woman hands the prince a cup of tea as he is shown around the old town on the fifth day of the tour . Looking good: A dapper Charles strikes a pose in front of the Al-Ula historical site . Guided tour: Despite being engulfed in a dust storm at one point, Charles stayed upbeat throughout . Incredible: The site has prehistoric origins and was once a hub for the Nabataean people . On tour: Charles has spent the last two days in Saudi Arabia and will travel on to Qatar on Thursday . Fascinating stuff: A dapper Charles is given a tour of the remains of the Al-Ula buildings . Charles has spent the last two days in Saudi Arabia and used his meeting with newly enthroned King Salman to raise the case of imprisoned blogger, Raif Badawi. Mr Badawi was sentenced to 1,000 lashes for discussing political and religious freedom on the internet and 'disobeying' his father. Today Charles will fly on to Qatar for the next stop on his government-backed tour aimed at fostering better relationships in the crucial Arabian region. Nice to meet you: Charles is welcomed to Al-Ula province by Crown Prince Sultan bin Salman . Bumpy ride: Dust storms meant that Charles had to endure an uncomfortably bumpy flight .

"This is the shocking moment a driver was knocked down by his own van after he tried to stop a thief making off with it – after he left the keys in the ignition at a petrol station. The 43-year-old motorist's van was targeted at Dean Service Station in Rochdale, Greater Manchester, after he went into the petrol station and left his van unattended with the keys inside. An 'opportunistic thief' jumped into the driver's seat and drove the van, which was loaded with tools, off the forecourt. The thief jumped into the unattended van and started to drive it off the forecourt. CCTV footage shows the driver running out of the shop and attempting to stop the van by putting his hand up in front of the bonnet . The driver then attempts to run in front of his van as part of a desperate attempt to stop the thief making off with it. The white van was loaded with tools and equipment, including a laptop, at the time of the incident . The driver can be seen in the CCTV video being struck by the van, as the thief continues to make his getaway . The motorist fell to the floor after being knocked down by the thief, who drove off in the van after the incident . However, as he did so, the motorist saw his van being taken and ran out of the garage shop, jumping in front of the moving van in a bid to stop the thief. He was knocked to the ground in the broad daylight incident on December 29, but escaped without serious injury. The van was found abandoned a few days later, with a laptop missing. Police have now released CCTV footage of the incident as part of desperate attempts to trace the thief. Detective Sergeant Chris Mannion, from Greater Manchester Police, said: 'This was an opportunistic robbery, the thief saw the keys left in the ignition, ran over to the van and drove. 'When the victim saw what was happening he tried to protect his livelihood and ran into the path of the moving van. 'Luckily for him he was not badly hurt, but that doesn't take away the fact he had his van stolen with equipment in the back. The 43-year-old motorist's van (pictured) was targeted at Dean Service Station in Rochdale, Greater Manchester, after he went into the petrol station and left his van unattended with the keys in the ignition . Police have now released CCTV footage of the incident as part of attempts to trace the thief (pictured), who is described as being late teens to early 20s, with a dark grey hooded top. He is also said to have a 'gaunt face' CCTV footage captures the thief approaching the van on the petrol station forecourt prior to the theft . The thief can be seen getting into the white van, after spotting his opportunity when the driver left it unattended, and with the keys in the ignition, when he went into the petrol station shop to pay for his fuel . 'A few days later the van was found through its tracker on Mellor Street in Royton. The thief had stolen a laptop and abandoned the van. 'If you recognise the man from the CCTV footage or have any formation about who may have committed this crime, please contact us as soon as possible.' The thief is described as white and was wearing a grey hooded top with the hood up at the time of the incident. Police said he was in his late teens to early 20s, of slim build and is described as having a 'gaunt face'.

"Perched on the northern end of Great Salt Lake, Box Elder County is named after a tree native to the area. Once an historical and cultural centre, a barren landscape and broken down buildings now populate the town. Also the site of Robert Smithson's Spiral Jetty artwork, it was this conceptual work that first inspired London-based photographer, Anthony Gerace, to fly out and explore the area. Scroll down for video . Box Elder County, named after a native tree, is now a barren landscape dotted with abandoned buildings . The area is most famous for Robert Smithson's conceptual artwork, which inspired Anthony Gerace . As he researched the Jetty further, Gerace became more and more interested in everything that surrounded it. 'It's a case study in decline,' Gerace told MailOnline Travel of his photo project. 'How a community that has so much history can still have it rendered null by the encroachment of desert, salt and heat.' 'By tracing a path from habitation to skeletons of towns that no longer exist and finally to the scrubland desert and salt flats edging the Great Salt Lake, the project seeks to explain how history can fail and become meaningless in the face of nature's absoluteness.' As Gerace researched the home of Smithson's Jetty further, the more interested he became in its surroundings . Gerace refers to his Box Elder photographer project as 'a case study in decline', capturing how nature is claiming back space as towns stand all-but abandoned . The community has been all but rendered null due to the encroachment of desert, salt and heat and declining local industries . The project seeks explain how history can fail and become meaningless in the face of nature's absoluteness . For the project, Gerace traced a path to skeletons of towns that no longer exist and to the desert and salt flats . American space agency, NASA, has a site and conducts rocket tests in the little-known town, making use of its expanses of wilderness . Ultimately, Gerace hoped that - despite the desolate images - that the project would say something positive . Despite the desolate images, Gerace wanted Box Elder to ultimately say something positive about the county and the country, more generally. The project conveys a multitude of voices to varying degrees, even in a place this remote. 'What I ended up finding is that history itself conforms to the pervasive decline felt everywhere else in the country,' Gerace explains. 'Everyday objects are raised to the status of relics while the places people live go to seed. 'Small wonders, such as the Golden Spike or the world's biggest peanut, for instance, are made canonical and static by the inclusion of a staffed museum that tries to obliterate anything negative from the record.' Everyday objects are raised to the status of relics while the places people live go to seed, he tells MailOnline . Gerace found that the history of Box Elder conforms to the pervasive decline felt everywhere in the country . Although inspired by the Jetty, Smithson's vision was ultimately not what Gerace expected it to be, but he still found inspiration in the sense of abandonment . Gerace also said that quickly 'perception became a joke,' since everything was flat and white in the landscape . Although Smithson's vision of the Jetty was admittedly not what Gerace thought it would be. 'We drove out to the Spiral Jetty on our third day in the country, and like all the days preceding and all the days following, it was sunny, dry and incredibly hot,' he remembers. 'Rozel Point, the part of the lake where the Jetty resides, is famous for a botched oil drilling operation, a piece of conceptual art and a pink algae that's the only that can survive in the hypersalinated water. 'Perspective becomes a joke: everything is flat and white and the horizon bleeds into the sky. On that day, after walking the length of the jetty and photographing several dead birds, I began to walk toward the horizon. 'Utah was in the midst of a drought and that, coupled with the amount of salt around us and the heat, made me thirsty and crazy and bug-eyed.' More often than not in Gerace's landscape photographs, the horizon bleeds into the skyline . The series of photographs is about 'confronting the effect of entropy on objects,' says Gerace . He hopes that he's created a project that radiates the joy that comes with being some place strange . Box Elder County is sliding into an entropic state and the garbage and weirdness that's there reinforces that . 'Really, [Smithson's work] is just a means of confronting the effect of entropy on objects and that's what the series ended up being about,' he adds. 'Box Elder is a place that's sliding slowly into an entropic state and the garbage and damage and weirdness that's there, and the absolutely beautiful but incredible hostile and alien landscape surrounding it, reinforces that. 'I'd wanted to make the project something that radiated the joy felt at being in a place so strange and different. 'I'd wanted to engage with the space in a way that provoked a sublime response, and in a lot of ways it did, although not at all in the way I'd envisioned.'","Haunting photo series is the work of London-based photographer Anthony Gerace .

"Maria C. Waltherr-Willard (pictured) tried to sue her school district for discrimination after claiming she had a phobia of young children . An Ohio school teacher who tried to sue her school district for discrimination after claiming she had a phobia of young children has had her case thrown out by court. Maria C. Waltherr-Willard, of Greenhills, Ohio, had worked as a high school French and Spanish teacher but alleged the school district reassigned her to teach junior high as a way of expediting her exit. The 63-year-old said she suffered from pedophobia, a fear of young children, and claimed the Mariemont school district knew of her condition and still assigned her to teach younger aged students. But she lost her appeal at a three-judge panel of the 6th US Circuit Court of Appeals in Cincinnati. The teacher claimed she had suffered from pedophobia since the 1990s and had been told by school district that she would not have to teach young children. Mariemont sent Willard to a psychiatrist for an independent evaluation, which confirmed that her 'mental state...would disable her from teaching [children under 12].' For the next twelve years, Willard remained at the high school, where she taught all levels of French and the introductory course in Spanish. Ms Willard had worked as a high school French and Spanish teacher but alleged Mariemont High School (pictured) reassigned her to teach junior high as a way of forcing her to quit . Eventually, Mariemont decided to move its French courses online, which meant that the high school no longer needed a French teacher. The school district's superintendent, Paul Imhoff, met with the high-school principal, James Renner, to discuss what to do with Ms Willard. Mr Renner told Mr Imhoff about Willard's pedophobia and so he decided to transfer her to middle school. Ms Willard did not object to the new assignment, and later expressed 'enthusiasm' for teaching middle school children. Willard began teaching at the middle school in September 2010. Six months later, she asked Mr Imhoff to send her back to the high school, saying that her talents were 'underutilized' at the middle school and that another year there would have 'further detrimental impact on [her] health.' Mr Imhoff responded that '[t]here are currently no openings at Mariemont High School for the next year, but I will keep your request on file.' Shortly thereafter, Ms Willard retired. The teacher claimed her move to middle school caused her blood pressure to soar - but her case was rejected . Two years later, she brought the lawsuit against the school saying her transfer to the middle school had triggered her phobia. She claimed it caused her blood pressure to soar and forced her to retire in the middle of the 2010-11 school year. But the federal court upheld the decision of the lower court saying it was correct in ruling in the school district's favor on the various claims, including age and disability discrimination. It said Ms Willard had asked to school to employ her at the high school as a full-time Spanish teacher (on account of her disability), but it already had one and so did not need another. It also said she was not discriminated against for her age, as her replacement was 'not substantially younger than she was'. The court also rejected her claim she was treated with 'ridicule and insult' as any emails circulated behind her back did not refer to her age or pedophobia.","Maria C.

"Bruce Jenner may be to blame for the four-car crash that left one person dead and seven injured, according to sources who said that the pattern of damage on the car he rear-ended suggested that impact was the very first  in the sequence. Former Olympian Jenner, 65, smashed his Cadillac Escalade into the back of the victim's white Lexus on the Pacific Coast Highway in Malibu, California, on Saturday. According to previous reports, the Lexus had been in Jenner's path after coming to a halt when it hit a Prius travelling ahead. The Lexus was then pushed into the path of a Hummer coming the other way, leaving the vehicle a crumpled wreck and the sole occupant, 69-year-old Kim Howe, dead. Scroll down for video . Bruce Jenner may have struck both the white Lexus and and a Prius in the horror crash on Pacific Coast Highway in Malibu, California, on Saturday, according to TMZ . Police sources told TMZ that an theory operating theory is that Jenner rear-ended the Lexus and when the Lexus cleared his lane, his car kept moving and crashed into the Prius . Bruce Jenner surveys the crash scene and the damage to the cars which were involved in the horrific smash . The 65-year-old former Olympian's Cadillac Escalade rear-ended a white Lexus, whose sole occupant died . Sources told TMZ that there is an imprint of Jenner's license plate in the car, pictured after the crash . The Kardashian family patriarch, who escaped the crash unscathed, took a roadside sobriety test in front of officers in the wake of the collision, which he passed. Investigators are now trying to determine the cause and circumstances surrounding the crash and plan to look at the cellphone records of all four drivers and check for any video evidence . Now, sources have told TMZ that, rather than the chain reaction being caused by the victim's Lexus hitting the Prius in front of her, Jenner may have hit both cars. They claimed that because the Lexus had been travelling in a straight line before being rear-ended by Jenner's Escalade, if the Lexus had first struck the Prius, there would have been the same amount of damage to the left and right sides of the front of the Lexus before he hit it - but pictures of the incident suggest there is not. A representative for the Prius also driver told TMZ that there is an imprint of Jenner's license plate in the car. Law enforcement sources told the celebrity news site that one operating theory is that the Prius had been stopped behind cars and, as a traffic light turned green, vehicles began moving. It was at this point, sources say, that Jenner rear-ended the Lexus and when the Lexus cleared his lane, his car kept moving and crashed into the Prius. TMZ reported that police say when Jenner hit the Lexus, it veered left while his Escalade moved to the right. The woman who died in the four-car crash was 69-year-old widow Kim Howe, a neighbour of the Kardashians . Bruce Jenner was pictured holding a cigarette out the window of his Cadillac Escalade before the crash . Here, a zoomed-out version of the image shows Jenner's SUV before it sustained dents to the bonnet . Detectives in Malibu have opened a vehicular homicide investigation. If any of the drivers in the crash are found criminally negligent, felony charges could be filed - which carry a sentence of up to six years in prison. If it is determined that Jenner's Escalade struck both cars and authorities find he was following too closely, it would make prosecution for vehicular manslaughter more likely than if he was just part of the chain reaction. Jenner, who was involved in the fatal crash on Saturday, is seen taking a sobriety test in front of officers . Jenner co-operated with officers, walking in a straight line at their instruction. He passed the test . The Kardashian family patriarch was towing a dune buggy at the time of the crash, pictured right . Investigations will determine if Jenner, or any of the other three drivers involved in the collision, were texting or on their mobile phones at the time of the collision. It is illegal to text while driving in California. The star's representative has denied that he was texting behind the wheel. Breaking his silence on the crash the following day, Jenner said in a statement: 'My heartfelt and deepest sympathies go out to the family and loved ones, and to all of those who were involved or injured in this terrible accident.' 'It is a devastating tragedy, and I cannot pretend to imagine what this family is going through at this time. I am praying for them. I will continue to cooperate in every way possible.' But three days after the crash, Jenner was seen talking on his phone while driving in Los Angeles. The reality star had the device pressed to his ear while behind the wheel in Thousand Oaks, California. Jenner's Cadillac Escalade hit the back of the victim's white Lexus on the Pacific Coast Highway in Malibu, California, which then reportedly hit a Prius before being pushed into the path of a Hummer . The Pacific Coast Highway was shut down as detectives opened a vehicular homicide investigation . If it is determined that Jenner's Escalade struck both cars and authorities find he was following too closely, it would make prosecution for vehicular manslaughter more likely .

"Seven warehouse workers have been awarded nearly $15 million by a federal jury after their bosses segregated workers by race and called black employees 'lazy, stupid Africans'. Among the plaintiffs was a white whistleblower who lost his job shortly after complaining about the racist treatment at Matheson Trucking and Matheson Flight Extenders Inc., according to the lawsuit. The verdict in Denver, Colorado on Wednesday includes $13 million in punitive damages, $318,000 in back pay for workers who were fired for being black, and another $650,000 for emotional distress, the Denver Post reported. Matheson, a company based in Sacramento, California that transports mail for the U.S. Postal Service and private companies, such as FedEx, also was ordered to pay the workers' legal costs. Lawsuit: Mahamet Camara, left, and Macire Diarra, right, were among seven warehouse workers who were awarded $15 million by a jury after their employers discriminated against them for being black . According to the lawsuit, black employees worked on one side of the Commerce City warehouse and whites worked on the other side. White staff were accused of using racial epithets and calling employees 'lazy, stupid Africans', and on one occasion, an employee yelled that all black people should be shot - and used the 'n' word. The workers added that the treatment became much worse after 2007, when Leslie Capra became the station manager and was 'more openly hostile towards black employees' - and encouraged others to act in the same way, according to the lawsuit. Six of the plaintiffs were black - many were from the African country of Mali and one was from Brazil - and one plaintiff was a white whistleblower who was fired for challenging the company's practices. After complaining, he said he was branded 'the tribe's assistant', by bosses, the lawsuit said. 'Basically, I did the right thing. This isn't 1960 anymore,' said the white employee, Dean Patricelli. According to the lawsuit, which was filed in 2010, workers were discriminated against in all phases of employment, including hiring, termination, conditions of employment, promotion, vacation pay, furlough, discipline, work shifts, benefits and wages. Accused: The lawsuit said the treatment became more commonplace when Leslie Capra, pictured, became the station manager in 2007. She was 'openly hostile' to black employees, according to the lawsuit . Workplace: Attorneys for Matheson Trucking and Matheson Flight Extenders Inc., which transports mail for the U.S. Postal Service and private companies, such as FedEx, said they will appeal the jury's decision . For example, all employees liked working holidays because they would get double pay. But supervisors gave the shifts only to white employees, including those with less seniority than their black counterparts.

"The Deputy leader of the Opposition has made a passionate plea for the lives of the Bali Nine ringleaders on death row in Indonesia to be spared by highlighting her own husband's drug reform story. Tanya Plibersek's husband Michael Coutts-Trotter  was convicted of conspiracy to import drugs in 1986, at the age of 21, and served three years of a nine-year prison sentence. He has turned his life around and is now Secretary of the New South Wales Department of Family and Community Services. Meanwhile, Sydney men Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran, are due to face a firing squad this month after they were convicted of heroin trafficking in Indonesia in 2006. Scroll down for video . Tanya Plibersek's husband Michael Coutts-Trotter (left) was convicted of conspiracy to import drugs in 1986 . They have already spent nine years in jail for a crime they committed when they were in their early twenties and could be executed by firing squad any day now. 'In 1988, my husband left prison after being charged and convicted of a similar crime to these young men. I imagine what would have happened if he had been caught in Thailand instead of in Australia where that crime was committed, where he was coming back to Australia,' Ms Plibersek said in Parliament on Thursday. 'I think about – I didn't know him at the time, this is 30 years ago – what would the world have missed out on? They would have missed out on the three beautiful children we have had together. They would have missed out on a man who spent the rest of his life making amends for the crime that he committed,' she added. Despite lawyers arguing they are reformed men and mounting international pressure against their execution, Indonesia's president has refused to grant Chan and Sukumaran pardons. Legal appeals against their sentence have also repeatedly been quashed. Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran have been in an Indonesian jail since 2006 and are facing execution in the next month . 'We need to have a principled and methodical approach to punishments of serious crime. I perhaps have a particular view on remorse and redemption because of experiences in my own life. In 1988, my husband left prison after being charged and convicted of a similar crime to these young men. I imagine what would have happened if he had been caught in Thailand instead of in Australia where that crime was committed, where he was coming back to Australia. I think about – I didn’t know him at the time, this is 30 years ago – what would the world have missed out on? They would have missed out on the three beautiful children we have had together. They would have missed out on a man who spent the rest of his life making amends for the crime that he committed. I have another perspective on this, too. In 1997, I lost my brother to a violent crime in Port Moresby. I know that if I had been the one making the decision about the punishment of the person who did that crime, I couldn’t have thought of a punishment bad enough. That’s why we don’t make decisions about punishment on the basis of how we feel but on the basis of universal, consistently-applied rules. I think it is important to say that when it comes to the death penalty, there has been for many years in Australia a bipartisan rejection of the death penalty.' Deputy opposition leader Tanya Plibersek speaks in the House Of Representatives at Parliament House in Canberra, Thursday, February 12 . Mr Coutts-Trotter, now a high-level public servant, said in a statement to Daily Mail Australia his experience was no where near as difficult as that faced by Chan and Sukumaran or their families and he doesn't want to disrespect them by suggesting otherwise. 'Like a great many Australians I oppose the death penalty,' he said. 'These two young men have done serious wrong and should be punished with substantial gaol terms. But they should be granted mercy and not death. 'Alive in gaol Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran have the chance – and the obligation - to make amends and regain their dignity by serving others. And their families have the chance to love and support them to do so. 'From all reports, they would work their lives through to repay that generosity,' Mr Coutts-Trotter reasoned. 'I was afforded a second chance by our Australian justice system. I remain grateful for that every day.' The couple have 'three beautiful children' together, seen here at the Lego Movie premier in March, 2014 . Ms Plibersek spoke in parliament in support of Foreign Minister Julie Bishop, who says the execution of the Bali nine ringleaders would be a grave injustice. An emotional Ms Bishop also made a speech in parliament on Thursday to plead for the lives of Chan and Sukumaran. Australia was not seeking to understate the gravity of their crimes, but the death penalty was a bridge too far, she said. 'This motion goes to the heart of what we believe will be a grave injustice against two Australian citizens facing execution in Indonesia,' she told the lower house. 'Without doubt, Andrew and Myuran need to pay for their crimes with lengthy jail sentences but they should not need to pay with their lives.' Deputy Opposition Leader Tanya Plibersek spoke out in a bid to help the Bali Nine pair . Mr Coutts-Trotter has turned his life around and is now Secretary of the New South Wales Department of Family and Community Services . Ms Plibersek said capital punishment 'barbarised' the executioner, while speaking in parliament . Ms Bishop said more than 30,000 Australians have implored the Indonesian president and members of the Indonesian government for a stay of their executions. Her shared hope with those petitioners was for the Indonesian government to show mercy, she said. 'I believe it is Indonesia that will lose the most from executing these two young men,' she said. No country had done as much as Australia to support Indonesia in fighting drug-related crime, Ms Bishop said. Ms Plibersek said capital punishment 'barbarised' the executioner. 'It's left over from an earlier and more barbaric time,' she said. She said she remained hopeful the Indonesian government would show clemency and order a stay of execution. A candlelight vigil was held in Sydney's Martin Place  in January in support of Sukumaran and Chan . Sukumaran and Chan are both reportedly reformed after turning to art and religion in jail .","Tanya Plibersek's husband Michael Coutts-Trotter sold heroin .

"Jamaica now has the world's highest proportion of female bosses according to a new United Nations study but the country's men could be falling prey to a culture of criminality. With nearly 60 per cent of the country's managers being women, it dwarfs both United States' 43 per cent and Japan's 11 per cent. Experts claim their rise to power is partly due to improvements in female education but also because men have failed to keep pace with them. While government officials celebrate the women's success, they are deeply worried about their 'stagnating' men who are performing worse academically and have a much higher risk of falling into criminality. The boss: Jamaica has more female managers - such as Ravn Rae (pictured) who owns her own smoking paraphernalia store - than any country in the world . Girl power: Experts say the dramatic rise in female managers is due to improvements in female education but also because the country's men are falling behind and, in some cases, moving backwards (file photo) High school teacher and blogger Wayne Campbell believes they are being brought down by musical culture that 'celebrates law-breaking'. Jamaica is the birthplace of reggae music - made famous by the legendary Bob Marley. But its offshoot 'dance-hall' has been criticised for its violent, misogynistic and homophobic lyrics. Last year, dance-hall star Vybz Kartel was sentenced to life in prison for the murder of one of his former associates in August 2011. He was the first Jamaican artist whose music was completely banned from the airwaves by the country's National Communications Network, who said his lyrics were 'obscene' and brought 'nothing positive' to the entertainment industry. But his songs continued to be played by many - especially those in Jamaica's slums where he is considered somewhat of a hero, the Huffington Post reports. Mr Campbell also claimed men devalue academic achievement and boys who display school smarts are ridiculed as feminine by their peers and even adults. 'It's almost as if manhood and masculinity have been hijacked by a thug culture far removed from education,' he added. Growing, selling and consuming cannabis in Jamaica is technically illegal but the law is often overlooked and the drug is sold openly. And on January 22, the country's Cabinet approved a bill to decriminalise the possession and sale of small amounts of marijuana - as well as allowing private cultivation.

Grey area: Growing, selling and consuming cannabis in Jamaica is technically illegal but the law is often overlooked and the drug is sold openly (file photo) A young businesswoman who sells smoking paraphernalia and hopes to expand into medical marijuana says women are now the 'main breadwinners'. Ravn Rae said: 'Caribbean culture has a laid-back, slow-paced vibe. But generally, Caribbean men are a lot more relaxed than the women... We push harder to earn.' With more women pursuing higher education than men, the gender gap could grow even wider. For years there has been a steady 70-30 ration in favour of women at the University of West Indies, a public university system serving over 18 Caribbean countries and territories. Educators say the sheer scale of boys' academic underachievement points to the need for big changes in the way lessons are planned and delivered. From Trinidad and Tobago in the south to the northern archipelago of the Bahamas, education ministries have been trying for years to solve the crisis which spills over to create social unrest. Grace McLean, Jamaica's chief education officer, says their underachievement in the classroom is 'weighing heavily on national socio-economic development.' Not everyone is convinced regional women are close to pulling ahead of men in Caribbean societies. The majority of top positions are still dominated by men even if countries like Jamica have female heads of state, says Camille Hernandez-Ramdwar who researches Caribbean cultures at Canada's Ryerson University. She says women in the Caribbean still 'have to contend with old-boy networks, male privilege, and males dominating in the justice, social, political and religious systems'.","Nearly 60 per cent of Jamaica's managers are women, new data has shown .

"Claire Marshall Hernandez posted a photograph of a 'vulnerable' passenger online and called her 'an absolutely barking mad nutter' An air stewardess posted a photograph of a 'vulnerable' passenger online and called her 'an absolutely barking mad nutter'. Claire Marshall Hernandez uploaded the image to a Facebook group, telling colleagues that the female passenger was an 'absolute nightmare.' The Thomson Airways attendant, who has been disciplined for her actions, said the unidentified woman claimed to have been on the X Factor and began 'belting out' a Diana Ross tune, adding: 'She will keep you very busy.' Miss Hernandez, 37, was on a return flight from the Caribbean when she secretly took a picture of the woman in her seat. The mother of one, from Manchester, then uploaded the picture to the Thomson Airways Info Group on Facebook and criticised the passenger in the photo's caption, in which she added: 'Oh and she's got a stash of brandy in that handbag. 'She also blocked up the whole of the front toilet with God knows what.' Miss Hernandez went on to criticise the woman's floral dress in a comment beneath her post, which received at least 12 'likes'. It is understood that a group administrator removed the post shortly afterwards, but not before it was spotted by a member of the public. The man, who asked not to be named, said Miss Hernandez's post was 'appalling'. He said: 'This lady is clearly a vulnerable adult. What the stewardess's post is saying, up to an extent, is that 'she is clearly unwell, however I am going to mock her and make a laughing stock of her'.' He added: 'Considering that cabin crew are trained in ensuring that passengers are taken to their destination safely, supposedly without judgment, to look after the welfare of 300 or more people ... and considering the traveller is paying for the seat and expecting that, I find this appalling. This mocks the whole purpose of having someone there for your safety and welfare. She said  the unidentified woman claimed to have been on the X Factor and began 'belting out' a Diana Ross tune, adding: 'She will keep you very busy' 'She is saying 'we are the number one holiday leisure company – however, we will mock you and cause you embarrassment on your travels'.' A Thomson Airways spokesman confirmed that Miss Hernandez had been disciplined for her conduct but would not say if she has been sacked. She said: 'We can confirm that the post was removed immediately, and the member of staff involved has been dealt with accordingly.' A spokesman for airline regulator the Civil Aviation Authority said: 'Cabin crew do frequently find themselves in stressful situations. However, they should clearly treat passengers with respect.

Speaking to the London-based magazine, the 18st 5lb model said: 'I want to empower girls in a different way. I’m lucky that I can do that with my body right now, but I’d like to do that with words.' Her big break came in 2011, when A&E chose her to be the face of their documentary series, Heavy, after discovering her online. Since then, she has modeled for Domino Dollhouse, SWAK, Jessica Louise Clothing, Evil Pawn Jewellery, Black Cat Bikinis, and more.

"A Labour council has banned pork from primary schools in its area claiming it is too expensive to monitor the diets of Islamic and Jewish pupils. Islington Council, in north London, has been slammed by members of the pork industry for taking chops, sausages and bacon off the menu. But while the local authority admits pork is no longer on the menu, it denies banning the meat - instead claiming pork is simply not provided under its current catering contract. Islington Council (pictured) in London has taken all pork products off the menu at primary schools in its area . The council has removed pork from all primary school lunches despite the fact it is still being served in Islington's secondary schools. An Islington Council spokesman said today: 'It's not true that pork is banned in our primary schools. 'It is not currently provided in our catering contract, but if any primary school wants to serve pork we will work with them to arrange it.' But the council has said previously that it is too expensive to serve pork because it has to monitor what every child eats, in case those whose cultural or religious beliefs forbid pork - such as Muslim or Jewish children - eat it by accident. Chris Godfrey, a master butcher who runs the 100-year-old Godfrey's butchers in Highbury Park, said: 'I feel quite strongly about this. I don't really feel we should pander too much to other religions. The local authority removed the meat despite the fact that pork is still being served in local secondary schools and is considered an affordable meat . 'It's not a bad thing to show consideration, but that shouldn't restrict the choice of everyone else. 'The kids deserve to have a choice. I don't think this ban helps anyone.' Dr Zoe Davies, chief executive of the National Pig Association, said: 'This is something we are particularity concerned about. 'It's something we have heard of but we wouldn't say it's common. 'It tends to happen in areas where there are large numbers of children from, for example, a Muslim background who wouldn't eat pork. 'But we would like there to be a choice. Pork is a very affordable and nutritious meat.' Cllr Joe Caluori, Islington Council's executive member for children and families, said: 'By not having pork on the menus in our schools, we can keep down costs and reduce food waste, maximising the schools meal budget in tough financial circumstances. 'We meet regularly with our catering contractor and stakeholders and the feedback is that schools are very happy with the food offered by the service.' A council spokesman said: 'Young children, some as young as four, of different religious and ethnic backgrounds may not know which foods contain pork, or may not realise the importance of avoiding it due to their culture or beliefs. 'Monitoring each child, every day ensuring they are avoiding pork, is an unnecessary cost at a time of tight budgets.'","Islington Council in London has banned pork from primary schools .

"On the day a ceasefire was finally agreed in Ukraine, two MPs traded blows in a full-blown and vicious punch-up. The fight took place between Yegor Sobolev, of the centre-right Samopomochi party, and Vadim Ivchenko, from the Fatherland party, also centre-right, in the country's parliament building. They squared up to one another and then threw a flurry of powerful punches at the other in the brawl that lasted half a minute.

"For two Aussie flatmates, it all began as a fun project to recreate the iconic opening credits from their favourite television show, The Simpsons. They used pixel art, which mimics the distinctive style of retro arcade games, to pay tribute to the 26-year-old credits which are known and loved in households across the globe. On February one Melbourne-based mates Ivan Dixon and Paul Robertson uploaded their incredible 'Simpsons Pixels' clip to YouTube and were amazed when it went viral, receiving more than a million hits in the first two days. But the real shock came when just twelve hours after their upload an email landed in their inbox from the makers of The Simpsons, requesting that they ring straight away. Scroll down for video . Aussie flatmates Ivan Dixon and Paul Robertson recreated the 26-year-old opening credits (left) from The Simpsons in a retro, arcade game-style (right) using pixel art . The clip was seen by the creators of The Simpsons and just 12 hours later the young Melbourne men received an email requesting they call the US as soon as possible . The ingenious reinvention of the opening credits (right) will appear at the beginning of a new episode, set to air on Sunday in the US . 'The email went to my spam folder, so I actually thought it was a hoax!' Dixon told Fairfax media. Instead, it was an entirely genuine request for their fantastic appropriation to be used as the opening credits for the very next episode of the Simpsons. It has been a whirlwind and a dream-come-true for the graphic designers. 'We secretly hoped they would pick it up, but it all came so fast,' Dixon told Fairfax. Exactly two weeks after the clip was uploaded, it will be seen at the beginning of a new episode which is set to air in the US this Sunday February 15 at 8pm. The flatmates called on visual artist Jeremy Downer to recreate the notorious Danny Elfman theme song for their clip, perfectly pairing with their arcade game theme. The artists have paid meticulous attention to detail, recreating scenes like Maggie and Marge driving . Homer Simpson, Mr Burns and Smithers (left to right) are shown in the new pixelated-style at the Nuclear Plant . And although the artists admit they had a lot of fun creating the video, they had to pay meticulous detail to ensure they carried it off without a hitch. In each episode of The Simpsons, the credits begin with prankster Bart Simpson writing a new phrase on the blackboard at Springfield Elementary School. Appropriately for the duo's contribution, the digitised credits open with Bart scribbling 'Pixel art is not art' repeatedly during detention. The quirky trip through Springfield shows the Nuclear Plant, Kwik-E-Mart, Moe's Tavern and their home at Evergreen Terrace as never seen before. Bart skateboards through town as if in a Mario Bros game, swerving through some familiar faces - and gaining 50 points when he bounces on barman Moe's head. The tribute video cleverly references some classic Simpsons moments for keen-eyed, die-hard fans. Shop owner Apu scans baby Maggie at the Kwik-E-Mart just like in the original opening credits . One of the most impressive moments of the clip is Marge's volumous hair flick at the supermarket . These include Stampy the elephant in a field;  Poochy on a boardwalk; Homer Simpson's barbershop quartet 'The Be Sharps' on the pub roof and the tragic Maude Flanders with a halo. However, there are new details to be found on every replay. 'Number One' from The Stonecutters and a flying pig are both particularly well-hidden within the action. In another nod to the gaming culture the creators love so much, nerdy muso Lisa Simpson plays the saxophone whilst the other students in the classroom stare down at their laps, distracted by their Gameboys. As for the ending, The Simpson's voice artist Hank Azaria put it best when he tweeted the clip with the caption: 'This gets kind of mind blowing at the end!' Dixon and Roberston are extremely talented and already have some amazing accomplishments to their name. The quirky trip through Springfield shows the Nuclear Plant, Moe's Tavern and Evergreen Terrace (pictured) Robertson works on graphics for games and did animation for episodes of Disney show Gravity Falls. Dixon was co-director on three of acclaimed Australian musician Gotye's filmclips. He has created Rubberhouse, an animation studio. He is beginning to gain notoriety, as just two weeks ago one of Dixon's clips was shared by UK comedian Ricky Gervais on his official Facebook page to more than two million followers. The hilarious cartoon shows Gervais' character from 'The Office' Brent dancing manically using the same pixel art animation. As for The Simpsons intro, there's also an extra incentive for anyone who manages to identify all the cameos in the clip. 'First person to name all the references wins a date with one of the hunks who made the SIMPSONS PIXELS video,' the pair joked.

"The Pope has branded couples who choose not to have children 'selfish' and said they are part of a  'greedy generation.' The pontiff said it was a 'depressed society' that considered offspring to be a weight or a risk. Pope Francis made the remarks in front of a large crowd during his weekly general audience in St Peter's Square, Rome. The Pope has branded couples who choose not to have children 'selfish' during an address to a large crowd in St Peter's Square . The pontiff said it was a 'depressed society' that considered children to be a weight or a risk . Addressing the crowd, he said life 'rejuvenates' when children arrive and they 'enrich it.' 'A society with a greedy generation, that doesn't want to surround itself with children, that considers them above all worrisome, a weight, a risk, is a depressed society,' he said, the Guardian reported. 'The choice to not have children is selfish. Life rejuvenates and acquires energy when it multiplies: It is enriched, not impoverished.' Pope Francis said children 'rejuvenate' life . The Pope had to apologise for offending large Catholic families by saying that there was no need to breed 'like rabbits.' The Pope caused dismay among larger families last month when he cautioned 'responsible parenthood' advising that three children was 'about right'. Speaking during a press conference on a flight back from the Philippines, he said that 'Some think that in order to be good Catholics we have to be like rabbits. No. Responsible parenthood.' Vatican Archbishop Giovanni Becciu apologised on Pope Francis' behalf by saying 'the Pope is truly sorry' that his remarks about large families 'caused such disorientation'. Archbishop Becciu told the Italian bishop's newspaper Avvenire that the pope 'absolutely did not want to disregard the beauty and the value of large families.' Just last week Pope Francis said it is fine for parents to smack their children as punishment for misbehaving. 'One time, I heard a father say, ""At times I have to hit my children a bit, but never in the face so as not to humiliate them"".,' the Pope said. 'That's great. He had a sense of dignity. He should punish, do the right thing, and then move on.' His comments come after he was forced to apologise to large Catholic families after saying that there was no need to breed 'like rabbits .","Pope Francis told crowd couples who don't have children are 'selfish'

"A three-year-old was fatally shot on Monday after picking up her father's loaded gun he left out in the living room where he was cleaning it earlier in the day. Alexis Mercer, 3, of LeBleu Settlement  died at a local hospital on Monday night following the accidental shooting at her home on Arsene Road. 'This is a moment as a Sheriff that I have to tell people, you have got to protect our children,' said Calcasieu Parish Sheriff Tony Mancuso in an interview with KLPC. Accidental shooting death: Alexis Mercer, 3, was fatally shot on Monday after picking up her father's loaded gun left out in the open in the living room where he was cleaning it earlier in the day . Mancuso said the father had been cleaning his guns in the living room that day, while his wife and children were gone, and he did not put them up before leaving for work. When the mother returned home with the three children, ages 1-3, the 3-year-old girl was able to get one of the loaded guns, accidentally causing the gun to fire. 'It makes me angry,' said Mancuso. 'It makes my heart hurt. It's just something that shouldn't happen.' Sheriff's office spokeswoman Kim Myers said the other children were not injured. She says the assortment of guns included a rifle and two handguns and said the child most likely used the hand gun. Mancuso said incidents like this could have easily been avoided. 'Lock your guns, and keep them out of reach of children,' he said. 'They can't do it on their own. They're curious. They're going to go look. They're going to show a friend. If you can't afford a gun safe, every single gun that's sold in America comes with a gun lock. Lock your guns and keep them out of reach of children.' Myers said when the investigation is complete, the case will be turned over to the District Attorney's Office to determine if any charges will be filed. Services for Mercer will be handled by Johnson & Brown Funeral Home. Visitation for Mercer will take place from 3-9 p.m. on Friday at the funeral home, followed by a mass at 10 a.m. on Saturday. Father Bennie Wego will officiate. Burial will follow the mass at LeFranc Cemetery.","Alexis Mercer, 3, allegedly shot herself with her father's gun he left sitting out in the living room .

"Claire O'Hanlon pictured, died after she grabbed onto the back of a truck while drunk and slipped under its wheel after it went over a speed ramp . A ‘bubbly’ woman was crushed to death under the wheels of a scaffolding lorry after drunkenly jumping onto the back to get a lift home, an inquest heard today. Claire O’Hanlon, 47, suffered massive head and pelvic injuries after the lorry bounced over a sleeping policeman and she fell under the wheels of the five ton truck. She and housemate Michelle Moore had clambered onto the back of the lorry around 4pm on November 15, 2013, after their friend Kate McMullen got into the cab to join her boyfriend Damon Carr and driver John Boswell. The women had been waiting at a bus stop near the scene at Danebury Avenue, Roehampton, on their way home following an afternoon out drinking at a nearby club. Ms O’Hanlon was more than three times over the drink driving limit when they flagged down the lorry after spotting it in the street, Westminster Coroner’s Court heard. Ms Moore broke down in tears as she told how she pulled Ms O’Hanlon up on to the flatbed lorry after climbing up herself when it was travelling at roughly 3mph. She looked on in horror as Ms O’Hanlon fell from the vehicle after it moved off and was crushed underneath the rear near-side wheel. Giving evidence, Ms Moore said: ‘Claire was unpredictable. She could come across as if she wasn’t heavily intoxicated. ‘We were going towards the bus stop when Kate saw Damon go by in the lorry and went over to ask for a lift. ‘He said no, but Kate and his daughter Ella got into the cab and suggested we jump on the back. ‘Claire asked me to give her a lift up by the time the lorry was moving and it all happened very quickly. ‘There was a bus behind us and I tried to give Claire a hand up as the lorry was moving off after I jumped on the back. ‘I looked over and before I knew it, she had gone. The lorry had hit a sleeping policeman, which was where she died.’ In a statement to police, Ms Moore - who had got onboard into a gap between the scaffolding poles - said: ‘Claire’s hands were slipping, I looked behind and saw her lying on the floor.’ Ms O'Hanlon was waiting at a bus stop on Danebury Avenue, Roehampton, pictured, after spending an afternoon drinking when she clambered aboard the lorry moments before she slipped to her death . Ms Hanlon's friends left a floral tribute near the scene of the tragedy after her death in November 2013 . She described her friend as a ‘happy go-lucky, bubbly’ person. Paramedics arriving within two minutes of a 999 call found Ms O’Hanlon close to the sleeping policeman surrounded by a crowd. Nothing could be done to save her and Ms O’Hanlon of Clarence Lane, Roehampton, she was declared dead at the scene. A post mortem revealed the cause of death as a ‘significant’ head injury following a ‘massive trauma’. Tests showed she had 293 microgrammes of alcohol per 100ml of blood, and a 364mg urine alcohol level, which is four times the legal drink drive limit. Cocaine was also found in her bloodstream plus a small amount of the anti-depressant diazepam. Driver Mr Boswell, who was driving home from work, told the inquest: ‘I was just driving off with my new passengers in the cab, I didn’t know there were other people (on the back). ‘I knew Damon’s girlfriend was getting in but that was it. As soon as the door was shut I just thought ‘That’s it, we’re ready to go’. ‘Then suddenly we had to stop, the lorry came to a standstill and I knew something had happened.’ Mr Carr told the hearing he heard a ‘scream’ and he jumped off to help but his ‘body turned numb’ and he ‘couldn’t do anything’ to help. They ruled there was good visibility and the road was dry at the time of the incident, which took place on a ‘cool, dry, evening’. Cars were parked along the road but traffic levels were good, the inquiry found. Collision investigator PC Richard Clark, of Thames Police, said: ‘This is not an incident where it requires the benefit of hindsight. It was clearly dangerous. ‘The lorry was excessively overweight but Mr Boswell did not need any extra driving license. ‘Anyone who passes a driving test is told to check their mirrors regularly when moving. ‘A trained HGV lorry driver would be expected to pay extra attention and look constantly for hazards in this built up area, but Mr Boswell was not one.’ Westminster Coroner's Court, pictured, heard that Ms O'Hanlon had an alcohol level in her system of four times the legal drink-drive limit, as well as cocaine and a small amount of the anti-depressant diazepam . Coroner Shirley Radcliffe recorded a verdict of accidental death. Ms Radcliffe told the court: ‘This was the tragic death of a young woman who was only 47 years old and fit and well. ‘Sadly she had been drinking on this afternoon, to the extent that her decision making was impaired. ‘Standing at a bus stop with her friends and their friend’s daughter, a lorry drove by which they flagged down and were given a lift on the vehicle. ‘In circumstances not entirely clear, Ms McMullen said the couple should just jump on the back. ‘I am satisfied the driver was unaware of Ms O’Hanlon and Ms Moore and their attempts to get on. ‘Ms Moore was lucky to get a good position on the vehicle, although clearly it was a risky one but Claire could not and sadly tried to get on the side. ‘It was only moving at about 3mph at the time and sadly did not seem as dangerous to her as it does in the cold light of day. ‘The lorry picked up to 15mph and tragically went over a speed cushion, creating some sort of jolt and Claire lost her grip and went underneath the lorry rather than just fall down. ‘Having gone under the rear axle, she was run over by a tyre, giving her a head injury. ‘This was simply a tragic accident and I offer my deepest condolences to her family and friends.’ Mourners left cards, flowers and notes - plus champagne bottles and scones - in memory of Ms O’Hanlon at the scene and paid tribute to a ‘very popular, lovely girl’.","Claire O'Hanlon tried to climb on board a scaffolding lorry while very drunk .

"Prince Andrew is to be promoted to the naval rank of Vice Admiral just weeks after he became mired in a teenage sex slave scandal. The Queen has approved the appointment, which is timed to mark her second son’s 55th birthday next week. Buckingham Palace last night said the move was a ‘long-standing convention’ that enables Andrew, who served as a Sea King pilot with the Royal Navy in the Falklands War, to be promoted in line with peers still serving in the military. Scroll down for video . Birthday present: The Duke of York has been promoted to vice-admiral by the Queen for his 55th birthday next week . Having fun: Andrew, pictured during a visit to Royal Naval Air Station Yeovilton, Somerset, last month, joined the Royal Navy at 18 and served in the Falklands . Sources stressed that the move also recognised the ‘enormous amount of work that HRH does in support of the Royal Navy’. The honorary appointment comes after a difficult few weeks for the Duke of York. Last month he was publicly accused by Virginia Roberts of knowingly having sex with her when she was just 17, which he has continued to deny vigorously. In court papers US citizen Miss Roberts, now a married mother of three, claimed that she was forced to sleep with the prince on three occasions by his close friend, convicted paedophile Jeffery Epstein. A photograph showing Andrew with his arm around Miss Roberts’ bare midriff when she visited London with Epstein was also submitted as part of the case. Andrew has already admitted a grave error of judgment on his behalf on continuing his friendship with Epstein after he was released from prison for soliciting a minor. In 2011 he was forced to step down as special UK trade envoy after being photographed with the shamed billionaire financier the previous year. Allegations: Virginia Roberts (right) has claimed that she was forced by  financier Jeffrey Epstein, a convicted sex offender, to have sex with Prince Andrew when she was 17, pictured together in early 2001 . Denial: Prince Andrew spoke for the first time last month to deny the sex accusations at the World Economic Forum in Davos . Buckingham Palace has vehemently denied the latest claims on the prince’s behalf, saying they are ‘categorically untrue’ and lack ‘any foundation’. And in a speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos earlier this month, Andrew, who continues to undertake royal duties funded by the Queen, stressed his innocence. The Queen has privately made clear she wants to stand by her second son and earlier this week allowed him to publish a photograph of her in her private apartment. The image, posted on the prince’s public Facebook account, was seen by some as a clear sign of her support. Now she has rubber-stamped his honorary promotion with the Royal Navy. In 2009 it was agreed that Andrew – who formally left the service in 2001 after 22 years – would enjoy ‘age-related’ promotions on par with colleagues who had remained in the service. Under the agreement, the prince was promoted to Rear Admiral when he turned 50 in 2009 and will become Vice Admiral on his 55th birthday on Thursday next week. He is due to become Admiral at 60 but any honorary rank after that would be at the behest of the Queen. The latest appointment was announced in the London Gazette. A Buckingham Palace spokesman said: ‘This was approved by the Queen in line with long-standing convention covering military promotions for members of the Royal Family.’ A Royal Navy spokesman added: ‘Following his active service, His Royal Highness has been hugely supportive of the Royal Navy and has undertaken a vast amount of work for the service over many years.’ A source added: ‘The Duke of York does a huge amount of work for the Royal Navy and in order for him to remain in step in terms of rank with his contemporaries... the Royal Navy established a policy in 2009 by which he is promoted in line with his peers.’ Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Duke of York has been promoted in time for his 55th birthday next week .

"Embattled Oregon Governor John Kitzhaber abruptly changed his mind and refused to resign despite the growing corruption scandal engulfing him and his fiancée, three people close to the situation told the Associated Press. They said the Democratic governor informed some of his aides on Sunday that he was going to step down, and on Tuesday he asked his would-be successor, Secretary of State Kate Brown, to rush back from a conference in Washington, D.C. They spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity Wednesday because they were not authorized to talk about private discussions. Brown's abrupt and unexplained return to Oregon sparked speculation that Kitzhaber planned to quit. Hours later, Kitzhaber issued a statement saying he would stay put. It was not clear why Kitzhaber changed his mind. Scroll down for video . Trouble? As an ethics controversy heats up around Gov. John Kitzhaber (seen in October 2014), he has said he is not resigning and is staying in office . Scandal: Newspaper editorial boards and Republican political operatives have been criticizing Kitzhaber and calling for him to leave office over allegations that his fiancée, Cylvia Hayes, used his office to land contracts for her consulting business. The couple are seen together in January 2015 . 'I was elected to do a job for the people of this great state and I intend to continue to do so,' Kitzhaber said, repeating a refrain he's uttered at least twice before in the past two weeks. The governor told KGW that he asked Brown, a Democrat, to return from Washington so he could tell her he was not resigning. Newspaper editorial boards and Republican political operatives have been criticizing Kitzhaber and calling for him to leave office over allegations that his fiancée, Cylvia Hayes, used his office to land contracts for her consulting business. She's accused of advocating policies that she was paid to promote. Hayes has been under increasing scrutiny since October, when a series of reports chronicled her work for organizations with an interest in Oregon public policy, which came as she served as an unpaid adviser in the governor's office. The focus led Hayes to reveal that she accepted about $5,000 to illegally marry an immigrant seeking immigration benefits in the 1990s. Later, she acknowledged purchasing a remote property with the intent to illegally grow marijuana. Kitzhaber, meanwhile, has denied wrongdoing, saying he and Hayes took steps to avoid conflicts of interest. Attorney General Ellen Rosenblum has launched a criminal investigation. Kitzhaber was re-elected by a wide margin in November, easily defeating Republican state Rep. Dennis Richardson. With the scandal surrounding Kitzhaber has overshadowing the state legislative session, which began last week, the governor met separately with legislative leaders on Tuesday. He told KGW that he wanted to discuss how his presence would affect the legislative agenda. Senate President Peter Courtney and House Speaker Tina Kotek, both Democrats, declined to say what was discussed, but Courtney indicated his was a difficult meeting. 'That was not a ""hi, how are you' meeting,""'said Courtney, who, like Kitzhaber, is among the state's most enduring political figures. 'I'm not smooth today, I'm not cool today. I don't have the nice cookie cutter press release statement today.' A fiercely private person, Kitzhaber has been forced to answer embarrassing and personal questions about his relationship. In response to questions at the news conference last month, Kitzhaber told reporters that he's in love with Hayes, but he's not blinded by it. Mystery: Kara Brown's abrupt and unexplained return to Oregon sparked speculation that Kitzhaber planned to quit. Hours later, he issued a statement saying he would stay put. It was not clear why he changed his mind.

"The wife of a conman accused of pretending to be in a coma for two years to avoid court has been arrested on suspicion of perverting the course of justice. Helen Knight, 33, has been questioned by police investigating how her husband Alan, 48, claimed he was in a vegetative state and spent months saying he could not stand trial. Mr Knight was jailed for four-and-a-half years after he conned more than £40,000 out of his dementia sufferer neighbour Ivor Richards, 86, after the pensioner was taken into a care home. Arrested: Helen Knight and her husband Alan, pictured together, have been questioned by police over claims they perverted the course of justice by allegedly pretending he was in a coma to avoid his fraud trial . After he was arrested for fraud he said he suffered a massive neck injury, which he claimed had caused him to have seizures which left him in a comatose state. His wife allegedly told police and doctors how she cared for her often-unconscious husband after he broke his neck while pulling down a garage door. But police found footage of him going on shopping trips and holidays with his family, the court heard, and he was later jailed for his neighbour fraud. Jailed: Knight, who claims he broke his neck in his garage, is currently in prison but has been re-arrested and questioned by police . His wife Helen and Mr Knight, who is in prison, have now both been arrested by police investigating the coma con for allegedly perverting the course of justice. Both were released on bail and a file of evidence is expected to be sent to the Crown Prosecution Service in the next fortnight. A South Wales Police spokesman said: 'Police have arrested a 48-year-old man and a 33-year-old woman from the Swansea area on suspicion of perverting the course of justice and money laundering offences. 'The pair are currently on police bail while an investigation continues.' Father-of-three Knight's trial heard he apparently tried to beat justice claiming he was a quadriplegic - and was even hooked up to oxygen and had no movement from the neck down. Swansea Crown Court heard how he 'systematically' funnelled £41,570 out of the pensioner's bank account which he used to pay for holidays and to buy a caravan in Dorset. He was caught on CCTV at the Severn bridge toll on the M4 as he travelled back from the south coast, the court heard. Knight was also allegedly captured on CCTV in Tesco stores across the country after police traced the use of the family's loyalty club card. Allegations: Police claim that this CCTV was taken at a time when Knight claimed that he was in a 'vegetative state'. The couple are understood to deny this . Officers tried to 'at least twice' to bring him court but each time he admitted himself to hospital claiming his condition had worsened. Swansea Crown Court was told he had 'pulled the wool' over his GP's eyes but he was unable to fool doctors at the hospital. While he was on 'observations' they spotted him eating, wiping his face and even writing. Knight eventually arrived in court in a wheelchair and neck brace. He admitted theft and forgery charges and was jailed for four and a half years in November last year. As he was sentenced, Judge Thomas told him: 'Aspects of this case in my experience are unique, and a strong message needs to be sent out to anyone who seeks to adopt similar tactics. 'Although a very accomplished and determined actor, he is nothing in like the condition he claims to be, and the conditions he claims to be suffering from are simply non existent.' The judge also ordered an investigation into his medical condition after the case was delayed for months.

"A violent career criminal is facing the death sentence after being convicted of murdering a pharmacist and his girlfriend. Hugo Selenski has been found guilty of the murder charges - nearly 13 years after he slayed Michael Kerkowski and Tammy Fassett. The human remains of three other people were also found in the yard of Selenski's northeastern Pennsylvania home. Hugo Selenski, center, is led from the Luzerne County Courthouse after being found guilty of the murders of a pharmacist and his girlfriend, nearly 13 years after the attack . After one failed conviction, the 41-year-old, who is already serving a long prison sentence on unrelated robbery charges, was convicted by the jury of strangling the pair. The jury concluded he killed the couple during a 2002 robbery and buried their bodies behind his house. He had little to say as he was led out of the courthouse, telling reporters 'not now.' He said: 'I always told all of you that I will talk to you when this is over, and I will do that. No questions right now.' Prosecutors said Selenski, and a co-conspirator, brutally beat Kerkowski to compel him to reveal the location of tens of thousands of dollars he kept in his house, then used flex ties to strangle him and Fassett. Authorities found their decomposing bodies on Selenski's property about a year later. A few months after his 2003 arrest, he escaped from prison using a rope fashioned from bed sheets and spent three days on the run before turning himself in. The jury reached its verdict after deliberating for more than 11 hours over two days. It convicted Selenski of eight of 10 counts, including first-degree murder and robbery, and must now decide whether to send him to death row or give him life in prison without parole. The penalty phase will start Tuesday. Heartbroken: Geraldine Kerkowski (left) mother of victim Michael Kerkowski leaves court after a trial which saw her testify against the killer. Selenski's sister Ruth Ann Pollard (right) cried at the verdict . Prosecutors and defense lawyers, under a gag order, were unable to comment on the verdict. One of Selenski's sisters cried quietly and left the courtroom after hearing it. The victims' relatives remained stoic, hugging prosecutors after the jury exited. Mr Kerkowski's mother, Geraldine, was heard whispering '13 years' after finally getting justice for her son. She had testified against her son's killer and ordered him to wipe the smirk off his face when she took to the witness stand. Earlier on, Selenski's brother Ronald Selenski Jr. was put in handcuffs after he rushed toward an elevator holding the victims' relatives threateningly. Sheriff's deputies walked him away from the elevator and put him in handcuffs. It wasn't immediately clear whether he would be charged. Hugo Selenski has been a familiar face in northeastern Pennsylvania since his 2003 arrest on charges he killed a pair of drug dealers whose charred remains also were found on the property north of Wilkes-Barre. Victims: Selenski was charged in 2003 for the murders of Michael Kerkowski (left), a drug-dealing pharmacist, and his girlfriend Tammy Fassett (right). He has now been found guilty of their murders . In 2006, a jury acquitted him of one homicide and deadlocked on another but convicted him of abusing the men's corpses. After the verdict, authorities immediately charged him with killing Kerkowski and Fassett. Kerkowski, from Hunlock Creek, had pleaded guilty to running a prescription drug ring that netted at least $800,000 and was about to be sentenced when he and Fassett were reported missing in May 2002. They were both 37 years old. The defense contended Selenski was framed by another man, Paul Weakley, who led police to the bodies in Selenski's yard. Weakley later pleaded guilty in federal court, testified against Selenski to avoid the death penalty and could ask for a reduction of his life prison sentence because of his cooperation. Weakley, who met Selenski in prison in the 1990s, told jurors how he plotted with Selenski to kill Kerkowski and then helped him carry out the crimes and bury the bodies. He described how he and Selenski bound the victims and covered their eyes with duct tape. Weakley said Kerkowski, who was beaten with a rolling pin, told them where to find his hidden bags of cash. He said Fassett was killed simply because she was with Kerkowski when they showed up at the pharmacist's house. After the killings, Selenski stole tens of thousands more dollars that Kerkowski had given to his father for safekeeping, pointing a gun at the father and threatening him, other witnesses said. The fifth body discovered on Selenski's property was never publicly identified.","Brutally beat one victim for money before strangling him to death .

"Politics is known as showbusiness for ugly people. But MPs are hoping to look better on television after agreeing to a plan for cameras to capture them at more flattering angles. New television cameras will be installed in the House of Commons chamber at eye-level in a bid to give more favourable views. New cameras will capture MPs in the Commons chamber from more flattering angles after the election . At present, there are only eight high and fixed camera positions that MPs complain show off their bald spots and emphasise cleavage. Female politicians have found that outfits that look acceptable from a normal angle look more revealing from above. From after the general election, two extra cameras will capture MPs from eye-level. The new cameras will be installed behind the Speakers’ chair. Sir Alan Haselhurst MP, chair of the Commons Administration Committee, said: ‘The Committee reviewed the trial footage and agreed that the new shots show Chamber proceedings in a way that will be more engaging, modern, and accessible to viewers. ‘The lower vantage points offer particular improvements when showing Members below the gangway, wheelchair users, and the front benches.’ Peter Knowles, controller of BBC Parliament, had previously told the committee that the current angles ‘are incredibly unflattering to the front benches’. Cameras were first allowed into the Commons in 1989, despite fears from MPs that they could dumb down their debates.","New House of Commons cameras to provide more flattering angles .

Louisa Hope, 52, who suffers from multiple sclerosis and needs a walking stick to move around, was one of the hostages that failed to get away and told 60 Minutes how she saw Mr Johnson die. 'When the noise of the gun, and then Tori fell forward... He hasn't just died, his life has been taken,' she said. Hostage Marcia Mikhael, 43, said Monis, who had a history of violence and extremism, told her he had a 'plan' to die in the standoff. A total of 18 people were taken hostage and were forced by captor Man Haron Monis to hold an Islamic flag up to the windows during the siege .

"A telescope in Chile has captured a stunning view of 'God's Hand' 1,300 light years away. The cometary globule, also known as CG4, shines brightly in this spectacular image, and looks as though it is about to grab at stars. Although it appears vivid in this picture, this is in fact a faint nebula, which makes it very hard for amateur sky watchers to spot. Scroll down for video . A telescope in Chile has captured a stunning view of 'God's Hand' 1,300 light years away.The cometary globule, also known as CG4, shines brightly in this spectacular image, and looks as though it is about to grab at stars. Although it appears vivid in this picture, this is in fact a faint nebula, which makes it very hard for amateur sky watchers to spot . Astronomers believe it is powered by the leftover, dense core of a star that blew up in a supernova explosion. But its exact nature remains a mystery. In 1976 several elongated comet-like objects were discovered on pictures taken with the UK Schmidt Telescope in Australia. Because of their appearance, they became known as cometary globules even though they have nothing in common with comets. They had dense, dark, dusty heads and long, faint tails, which were generally pointing away from the Vela supernova remnant located at the centre of the Gum Nebula. Although these objects are relatively close by, it took astronomers a long time to find them as they glow very dimly and are therefore hard to detect. The nebula is powered by the leftover, dense core of a star that blew up in a supernova explosion. The stellar corpse, called PSR B1509-58, or B1509 for short, is a pulsar: it rapidly spins around, seven times per second, firing out a particle wind into the material around it . God's Hand is a pulsar wind nebula. It's powered by the leftover, dense core of a star that blew up in a supernova explosion. The stellar corpse, called PSR B1509-58, or B1509 for short, is a pulsar. it rapidly spins around, seven times per second, firing out a particle wind into the material around it. These particles are interacting with magnetic fields around the material, causing it to glow with X-rays. It is located about 1300 light-years from Earth in the constellation of Puppis . The object shown in this latest picture, CG4, which is also sometimes referred to as the Mouth of the Beast, is one of these cometary globules. The fist of 'God's Hand', which is the part visible on this image and resembles the head of the gigantic beast, has a diameter of 1.5 light-years. The tail of the globule — which extends downwards and is not visible in the image — is about eight light-years long. By astronomical standards this makes it a comparatively small cloud. The relatively small size is a general feature of cometary globules. All of the cometary globules found so far are isolated, relatively small clouds of neutral gas and dust within the Milky Way, which are surrounded by hot ionised material. The head part of CG4 is a thick cloud of gas and dust, which is only visible because it is illuminated by the light from nearby stars. The radiation emitted by these stars is gradually destroying the head of the globule and eroding away the tiny particles that scatter the starlight. However, the dusty cloud of CG4, captured by the European Southern Observatory's Very Large Telescope, still contains enough gas to make several sun-sized stars. The head part of CG4 is a thick cloud of gas and dust, which is only visible because it is illuminated by the light from stars. This wide-field image shows a rich region of the sky in the constellation of Puppis (The Poop). At the centre lies the strange cometary globule CG4. Other interesting objects are also seen, including several much more distant spiral galaxies . Why CG4 and other cometary globules have their distinct form is still a matter of debate among astronomers and two theories have developed. Cometary globules could originally have been spherical nebulae, which were disrupted and acquired their new, unusual form because of the effects of a nearby supernova explosion. Other astronomers suggest, that cometary globules are shaped by stellar winds and ionising radiation from hot, massive stars. These effects could first lead to the bizarrely named formations known as elephant trunks and then eventually cometary globules. To find out more, astronomers need to find out the mass, density, temperature, and velocities of the material in the globules. These can be determined by the measurements of molecular spectral lines which are most easily accessible at millimetre wavelengths — wavelengths at which telescopes like the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (Alma) operate. This chart of the southern constellation of Puppis (The Poop, part of the mythological ship Argo) shows most of the stars visible with the naked eye on a dark and clear night. The position of the strange cometary globule CG4 is marked by a red ring .","The cometary globule, also known as CG4, is powered by the leftover, dense core of a star .

"After three months of closure, the Lindt Chocolate Café at the centre of the Sydney Siege is set to reopen in a matter of days. The scene of one of Australia’s most infamous terror attacks, workers at the Sydney CBD café said the café told The Daily Telegraph the shop will reopen by the end of the week. The café made headlines around the world in December when Islamic extremist Man Haron Monis held staff and patrons hostage there for about 17 hours. Repairs are currently under way at the Martin Place cafe after it was damaged during the siege that claimed the lives of cafe manager Tori Johnson and barrister Katrina Dawson in December. Lindt officially confirmed on Thursday they would reopen the cafe. 'After the tragic events that happened at the end of last year, we feel this is the right thing to do, to move forward and to push on in a positive way,' a spokesman said. Scroll down for video . The Lindt cafe at Martin Place will reopen in mid-March with a memorial to honour the bravery of the hostages and the two victims who died in the Sydney siege . Lindt Cafe manager Tori Johnson (left, pictured opening the Martin Place cafe in 2013) and barrister Katrina Dawson were both killed during the siege . 'We have taken this decision after careful consideration of a number of factors, the most important of which was consultation with our staff, whom feel positive about this decision and believe this is the best way forward.' The final opening date hasn't been announced but Lindt said they were working on plans for a memorial in the cafe to remember those affected. 'We are still confirming what the memorial will look like, as these things do take a little bit of time, but we feel this is fitting and appropriate to remember their bravery,' the spokesman said. Tori Johnson, 34, Katrina Dawson, 38, and the gunman who held them hostage for more than 16 hours were all killed. It was revealed at a coronial inquest last month that Mr Johnson was shot in the head at point blank range by crazed gunman Man Haron Monis after being forced to kneel on the cafe floor. Ms Dawson was killed by fragments of ricocheting bullets fired by police when they stormed the cafe soon after Mr Johnson was killed.

"The United Kingdom gave the Obama administration intelligence in June 2014 about where in Syria the ISIS terror army was holding its American captives, but the White House dithered and missed its opportunity to rescue them, according to a shocking report published Thursday. U.S. and British officials said the administration sat on the information for nearly a month before launching a military raid to recover American aid worker Kayla Mueller and journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff. By the time a rescue was mounted on July 4, 2014, the hostages had been moved. All three are now dead. ISIS militants executed Sotloff and Foley, and ISIS claims a Jordanian airstrike killed Mueller when it hit a buiding where she was being held. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEOS . DITHERER-IN-CHIEF: President Obama, shown yesterday with Secretary of State John Kerry and outgoign Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel, allegedly wasted precious time last year without acting when British and French intelligence pinpointed possible locations where ISIS was holding US hostages . Kayla Mueller, 26, an American humanitarian worker from Prescott, Arizona, was confirmed dead this week; she was among the ISIS hostages that the Obama administration may have been able to save . The Daily Beast quoted an unnamed American official saying that Obama’s national security team refused to plan a rescue mission around information gathered by a foreign government. 'The issue was that they didn’t trust it, and they wanted to develop and mature the intelligence, because it wasn’t our own,' the American official said. 'They got the information. They just didn’t trust it. And they did sit on it, there’s no doubt about that.' British officials and private security contractors said that hesitation was a source of frustration since a string of videotaped ISIS executions began in August and might possibly have been prevented. NOT SO MUCH: Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes told reporters in August that 'we've used all of our military, intelligence, diplomatic resources that we can bring to bear to try to pull a thread to find out where our hostages are . British intelligence had learned in May of last year from released ISIS captives the locations of two or three places where hostages were being held captive, according to the Daily Beast. The UK also had surveillance images from satellites and drones, and the results of some 'electronic eavesdropping. The information wasn't certain until early June, however. By then the British government had a 'positive identification and that information was shared with Washington,' according to a British source who spoke with the Daily Beast. National Security Council spokesperson Bernadette Meehan insisted that 'U.S. forces conducted this (rescue) operation as soon as the president and his national-security team were confident the mission could be carried out successfully and consistent with our policies for undertaking such operations.' But Foley's mother Diane said the U.S. also had intelligence from the French government about the hostages' whereabouts as early as March 2014 but did nothing about it. PREVENTABLE? American journalist James Foley was decapitated in a grisly video released online in August . BARBARIANS: American-Israeli journalist Stephen Sotloff met his fate in a video released in September . 'That was part of our frustration,' she told the Daily Beast. 'The State Department said they were connecting with the French and everybody at the highest levels. Very specific information was available as early as mid-March.' 'And that’s what’s been so tough for us as families, because apparently they were held in the same place all those months,' Foley said. Obama himself has pushed back against the idea that he acted too slow. 'I don’t think it’s accurate then to say that the United States government hasn’t done everything that we could,' he told the Buzzfeed website on Tuesday. 'We devoted enormous resources, and always devote enormous resources, to freeing captives or hostages anywhere in the world, and I deployed an entire operation at significant risk to rescue not only (Mueller), but the other individuals that had been held, and probably missed them by a day or two – precisely because we had that commitment.' The Washington Post reported in August 2014 that Obama had green-lighted that failed raid. 'We had a combination of ... intelligence that was sufficient to enable us to act on it,' an administration official said then. The Pentagon moved 'very aggressively, very quickly to try and recover our citizens,' according to that source. During Obama's Martha's Vineyard vacation in August, Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes told reporters that 'we've used all of our military, intelligence, diplomatic resources that we can bring to bear to try to pull a thread to find out where our hostages are; to try to rescue them when we saw an opportunity; to try to work with any country that might have any means of locating them.'","British intelligence knew in June 2014 the locations where released European hostages had been held by the ISIS terror army .

"Boasting seven decks, two pools, multiple hot tubs and a 275 square metre master suite, a new record-breaking superyacht is set to redefine the limits of luxury boat building. Costing £788million to build and measuring 222 metres in length, when completed Triple Deuce will be the most expensive and largest superyacht ever constructed. The luxury boat will surpass the remarkable standards set by Chelsea FC owner Roman Abramovich's 163m Eclipse, and the current record-holding 182 metres-long yacht  owned by the President of the United Arab Emirates. Scroll down for video . The new record breaking yacht, brokered by the company 4Yacht, has been named Triple Deuce . Remarkably, the boat - which will cost $30m a year to operate - will be longer than a Costa cruise ship . Once completed the new yacht will surpass Azzam (pictured), which is owned by Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the President of the United Arab Emirates . The world's current largest superyacht Azzam pictured during its launch in Germany in 2013 . Expected to require between $20 and $30million a year in operating costs alone, the build costs more than the annual GDP of Western Sahara, the British Virgin Islands and Micronesia, CNN reported. Although the identity of its owner remains a mystery, it is due to be completed in 2018 and is being purposely made 40m larger than the current record-holder in order to be difficult to beaten in size. Reports suggest that despite its size, the luxury private yacht will only carry 36 guests with a crew of around 50 - 70 people. The owner's suite will cover two stories across 275 metres-squared and offer unparalleled views, along with a private gym, office and dining room, according to Asian Pacific Boating. It will also have two staterooms, an exclusive elevator drive in dock and private access to a helipad. Guests will be entitled to use the yacht's outdoor and indoor pool, numerous hot tubs, spa facilities as well as a full time masseuse and hairdresser. Triple Deuce's top speed will be over 30 knots (35mph) and will be powered by triple gas turbine engines with over 100,000 horsepower. The vessel also has no rudders and will instead use electric podded propulsion units to manoeuvre. This graphic reveals the current standings of superyachts owned by the world's megarich . Craig Timm of 4Yacht, the broker of the building project, said its owner was motivated by boasting rights and construction, at an as yet undecided European shipyard, is expected to begin within the next 12 months. He also said that the building work will take two to three million hours to build and bring in employment opportunities for 500 people for a period of three years. 'It's just like the competition to build the world's tallest building. 'Our client was concerned that if we built the yacht to 220m, then someone would come along like Roman Abramovich when he built Eclipse at 163.5m, and outdid Sheikh Maktoum's yacht, the 162m Dubai, by only 1.5m. 'By building the yacht to 222m, the owner wants to make it difficult, if not impossible, to be ""eclipsed"" himself.' Abramovich's yacht was completed in December 2010 and is the world's third largest superyacht. It requires 70 crew members to operate and features two helicopter pads, three launch boats and a mini-submarine. When built, it took the title of world's biggest private yacht from the Dubai. This had taken the crown from the 138m Rising Sun, owned at the time by American businessman Larry Ellison, which in turn took over from the 126m Octopus, owned by Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen. However, Abramovich's reign as the owner of the world's largest superyacht was short lived - in 2013, the Emirati royal family knocked it off its perch with Azzam, which exceeded it in length by 16.5m. At the time it was predicted - quite accurately - that this would trigger a new round of one-upmanship among the world's super rich. Longer than 12 double-decker buses, not only is Azzam the biggest superyacht, it is also  one of the fastest. The 94,000 horsepower vessel can reach speeds of more than 30 knots, or 35mph. Chelsea FC owner Roman Abramovich's yacht Eclipse (pictured) will also be dwarfed by the new boat .

"The app-based car service Uber has called on the NSW government to implement the 'illegal' ride-sharing platform in a bid to make it a permanent transportation option. It pledges to create thousands of jobs for drivers, and customers who use their ride-sharing service UberX will get cut-price fares by taking trips in private cars driven by available drivers in their area. The submission by the company to the Independent Pricing and Regulatory Tribunal review said it's services provide a 'safe, reliable and affordable choices for consumers' as well as offering job opportunities to areas of high unemployment rates in Sydney. Uber's Senior Vice President David Plouffe announced on Tuesday that the company is committed to creating 20,000 new job opportunities in Australia this year . 'When comparing the areas Uber partners live and the unemployment rate in certain regions, it is clear they come from those areas where unemployment and under-employment are high,' the company said. 'Uber is helping to provide flexible economic opportunities for people who have previously not had access. 'In New South Wales Uber does not accept any partner that has any Australian criminal history recorded with CrimTrac or who has had their license suspended or has any record of a drink or drug driving record in NSW.' But a Transport for NSW spokesperson told Daily Mail Australia that it is illegal for drivers in NSW to participate in 'ride-sharing' activities like UberX. Uber has made a submission to the Independent Pricing and Regulatory Tribunal review to be allowed to operate . 'While Uber Pty Ltd does not breach the Passenger Transport Act 1990 by offering the service, drivers transporting passengers for a fare do,' the Transport for NSW spokesperson said. 'Any driver operating in these circumstances are potentially committing a number of offences, including driving without authority and offering a service without accreditation. UberX . Sydney CBD to Sydney Airport - $30 . Melbourne CBD to Melbourne Airport - $50 . Average taxi . Sydney CBD to Sydney Airport - $42 . Melbourne CBD to Melbourne Airport - $60 . 'Ride-sharing is a significant issue that - as we have said - needs to be worked through including via consultation with customers and industry, and nothing has changed. 'The safety of customers must be paramount in those discussions. Compliance activities will continue, to ensure the safety of passengers.' The submission, which was made last month, said NSW Transport Minister Gladys Berejiklian had refused to meet with representatives of Uber. However, Uber's Senior Vice President David Plouffe announced on Tuesday that the company is committed to creating 20,000 new job opportunities in Australia this year. 'Thousands of Australians have already found flexible work driving on the Uber platform. These partner-drivers are made up of a broad range of people including retirees, students, or mums and dads looking to supplement their income,' he said. Mr Plouffe explained that Uber will help people 'earn a good income quickly' 'We also have people who have found themselves unemployed but still need to pay the mortgage and provide for their families and Uber has provided them a way to earn a good income quickly. 'We are setting ourselves a challenge which we believe we can achieve through partnership with governments and organisations who share our vision of opening up economic opportunity in every city.' An Uber spokeswoman has confirmed with Daily Mail Australia that the company is in 'constructive dialogue' with the government and 'have now met with Minister Berejiklian' but could not comment further on the matter. Uber said their services provide a 'safe, reliable and affordable choices for consumers' Uber's director of public policy Oceania Brad Kitschke wrote in the submission that '100 percent of partner drivers who passed Uber's background checks were subsequently able to obtain government authority from the Roads and Maritime Service'. The Transport for NSW spokesperson added that: 'Roads and Maritime Service has issued 33 infringement notices totalling $28,500 to Uber X drivers. Additionally, 10 court attendance notices have been issued.'","Uber has called on the NSW government to use its ride-sharing platform .

"The man accused of shooting dead three Muslim students had previously come to their door brandishing a rifle, according to the best friend of one of the victims. Craig Hicks, 46, has been charged with three counts of first-degree murder for killing Deah Shaddy Barakat, 23, his wife Yusor Mohammad, 21, and her sister Razan Mohammad Abu-Salha, 19, at their apartment near the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill on Tuesday afternoon. Police said that Hicks, a self-proclaimed 'anti-theist', carried out the killings after a long-standing parking dispute but the victims' families believe it was a hate crime. Speaking to Fusion, Yusor Mohammad's best friend, Amira Ata, also dismissed the idea it was over parking - 'there's plenty of space' - and  said she believes they were targeted for being 'different'. Scroll down for video . Amira Ata (left) has dismissed the suggestion that her best friend, Yusor Mohammad (right), her husband and sister were killed over a parking dispute, saying their killer hated them 'because they were different' When she learned that her friends had been killed, she said she was not surprised that Hicks was accused of being the one behind it. 'I know that he's an aggressive man,' she said. 'That's not the first we've heard from him.' She recounted an evening of dinner and board games at the couple's home at the end of last year, and after she left, Yusor heard a knock at the door, she said. It was Hicks. He complained about the noise - even though it was still early - and about the parking - even though the guests had used visitor parking, Ata said. 'While he was at the door talking to Yusor, he was holding a rifle, she told me later,' Ata said. 'He didn't point it at anyone, but he still had it. 'We thought that was so weird - our neighbors don't come to the door with guns! So when I heard the news [of their deaths] it was shocking, but it wasn't a surprise that it was the neighbor.' Ata, who grew up with Yusor and spoke to her every day, said she could not imagine her friend saying anything to enrage Hicks before he shot them. Accused: Craig Hicks, 46, is pictured entering the courtroom for his first appearance at the Durham County Detention Center on Wednesday, after he allegedly shot the three students to death on Tuesday . Victims: From left, Deah Shaddy Barakat, 23, his wife Yusor Mohammad, 21, and her sister Razan Mohammad Abu-Salha, 19, were all found with bullet wounds to their heads inside the Chapel Hill apartment on Tuesday . 'I know Yusor didn't do anything to him – there's no way she could have said even one thing wrong to him because she doesn't get mad,' Ata said. 'Her husband is even nicer, her sister is even nicer – none of them would have said anything to make someone that angry.' She added: 'I wonder if he just thought Deah was some white guy before his wife moved in... 'Deep down everyone in this community knows it was a hate crime. But how do you prove it?' Police were still trying to determine whether religious hatred played any role in the shootings. On Wednesday neighbors said he always seemed angry and confrontational, while his ex-wife said he was obsessed with the shooting-rampage movie 'Falling Down,' and showed 'no compassion at all' for other people. His current wife, Karen Hicks, said at a tearful press conference that her husband of seven years 'champions the rights of others' and said the killings 'had nothing do with religion or the victims' faith'. She then issued another brief statement through her lawyer, saying she's divorcing him. Officers were summoned by a neighbor who called 911 on Tuesday evening to report hearing multiple gunshots and people screaming - before more gunshots and then silence. Vigil: On Wednesday night, hundreds gathered at UNC-Chapel Hill to mourn for the three victims . Devastated: Deah's father Namee Barakat, right, wipes away tears as he and his wife, Layla, left, watch photos projected on a screen during a vigil for their son, daughter-in-law and her sister on Wednesday . Pain: Women mourn during a vigil for the three young students at Chapel Hill on Wednesday night . Tribute: Students Anay Reddy and Mrinalini Ramanan light candles following the vigil . The women's father, Mohammad Abu-Salha, said police told him each was shot in the head inside the couple's apartment and that he, for one, is convinced it was a hate crime. 'The media here bombards the American citizen with Islamic, Islamic, Islamic terrorism and makes people here scared of us and hate us and want us out. So if somebody has any conflict with you, and they already hate you, you get a bullet in the head,' said Abu-Salha, who is a psychiatrist. The killings are fueling outrage among people who blame anti-Muslim rhetoric for hate crimes. A Muslim advocacy organization pressed authorities to investigate possible religious bias. Many posted social media updates with the hashtag #MuslimLivesMatter. 'We understand the concerns about the possibility that this was hate-motivated, and we will exhaust every lead to determine if that is the case,' Chapel Hill police Chief Chris Blue said in an email. Chapel Hill Police asked the FBI for help in their probe, and Ripley Rand, the U.S. Attorney for the Middle District of North Carolina, said his office was monitoring the investigation. Rand said the crime 'appears at this point to have been an isolated incident'. About 2,000 people attended a candlelight vigil for the victims in the heart of UNC's campus on Wednesday evening. Several people who knew them spoke about their selflessness as friends recounted kindnesses they had extended to others through the years. Speaking out: Craig Hicks' wife Karen Hicks, center flanked by her attorneys, said she did not believe the shooting was a hate crime. She later announced that she was divorcing her husband . But at their own press conference, Barakat's family called on the police to investigate it as a hate crime . Uproar: On Thursday, Palestinians protest against Hicks in front of the UN headquarters in Gaza City . Outrage: Protesters in Gaza show photos of the slain Muslims alongside images of Hicks in court . Barakat and Mohammad were newlyweds who helped the homeless and raised money to help Syrian refugees in Turkey. They met while helping to run the Muslim Student Association at N.C. State before he began pursuing an advanced degree in dentistry at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Mohammad, who graduated in December, planned to join her husband in dentistry school in the fall. Arrested: Neighbors said that Craig Hicks 'was always angry' and some saw him carrying a gun . Abu-Salha was visiting them from Raleigh, where she was majoring in design at N.C. State. 'This was like the power couple of our community,' said Ali Sajjad, 21, the association's current president. Hicks had less success: Unemployed and driving a 15-year-old car, his wife said he had been studying to become a paralegal. A Second Amendment rights advocate with a concealed weapons permit, Hicks often complained about both Christians and Muslims on his Facebook page. 'Some call me a gun toting Liberal, others call me an open-minded Conservative,' Hicks wrote. Imad Ahmad, who lived in the condo where his friends were killed until Barakat and Mohammed were married in December, said Hicks complained about once a month that the two men were parking in a visitor's space as well as their assigned spot. 'He would come over to the door, knock on the door and then have a gun on his hip saying, ""You guys need to not park here"",' said Ahmad, a graduate student in chemistry at UNC-Chapel Hill. 'He did it again after they got married.' Both Hicks and his neighbors complained to the property managers, who apparently didn't intervene. 'They told us to call the police if the guy came and harassed us again,' Ahmad said. 'This man was frustrated day in and day out about not being able to park where he wanted to,' said Karen Hicks' attorney, Robert Maitland. The killings were 'related to long-standing parking disputes my husband had with various neighbors regardless of their race, religion or creed,' Karen Hicks said. Scene: Flowers are seen near the building where the three young Muslims were killed on Tuesday afternoon . The couple's front door - now covered with biohazard stickers - is pictured after the three bodies were found inside. It is not clear how Hicks got inside the apartment but there were no signs of a forced entry . Beloved: Deah, right, was a dentistry student and his wife Yusor, left, was planning on joining him at dentistry school this year. Friends said they were like 'the power couple' of their community . Police have not said how Hicks got inside the condominium, but on Wednesday afternoon there were no visible signs of damage to the couple's door, which was affixed with orange stickers warning of biohazardous material inside. A wooden placard bearing Arabic script that translates to 'Thanks to God' hung over their doorbell. A woman who lives near the scene described Hicks as short-tempered. 'Anytime that I saw him or saw interaction with him or friends or anyone in the parking lot or myself, he was angry,' Samantha Maness said of Hicks. 'He was very angry, anytime I saw him.' Hicks' ex-wife, Cynthia Hurley, said that before they divorced about 17 years ago, his favorite movie was 'Falling Down,' the 1993 Michael Douglas film about a divorced unemployed engineer who goes on a shooting rampage. 'That always freaked me out,' Hurley said. 'He watched it incessantly. He thought it was hilarious. He had no compassion at all,' she said. In a brief court appearance Wednesday, Hicks, who lived in the same apartment building as the victims, appointed a public defender after saying he could not afford a lawyer. A probable cause hearing is scheduled for March 4. Police said Hicks was cooperating.","Deah Shaddy Barakat, 23, Yusor Mohammad, 21, and Razan Mohammad Abu-Salha, 19, were shot in a Chapel Hill apartment on Tuesday .

"Women who claim Fifty Shades of Grey promotes domestic violence and glamorises abusive relationships are rallying outside the film's UK premiere in protest. Feminist campaigners Fifty Shades Is Domestic Abuse say the novel dangerously romanticises the idea that women can fix broken men. A handful of men and women stood outside the central London premiere in Leicester Square today, unfurling a banner calling Christian Grey 'a rapist' as stars made their way along the red carpet. Scroll down for video . Protesters who say 50 Shades of Grey promotes domestic abuse rallied outside the UK premiere of the film this evening . Feminist group Fifty Shades Is Domestic Abuse argues that the novel glamorises abusive relationships and dangerously romanticises the idea that women can fix broken men . Alarming: A Twitter account, Fifty Shades is Abuse, claims that the novel glamorises domestic violence . Defending the film on the red carpet, Dakota Johnson, who plays Anastasia Steele in the film, said she wanted the demonstrators to see the movie. 'There is no part of the movie where [Anastasia] is abused. All the choices she makes are her choices and it's all consensual,' she told the BBC. 'Ana is a woman with incredible integrity and strength. I think that she is fearlessly exploring her strength and sexuality and I think that's a beautiful thing. Dakota Johnson said the film did not show her character being abused . 'I would love for [the protesters] to see the movie which I think has the opposite message.' Ahead of the release of the controversial film on Valentine's Day, activists called on the public to consider whether they should endorse the movie. Natalie Collins, who runs campaign group Fifty Shades Is Domestic Abuse, said the story portrays an abusive relationship. She said that if readers consider the lead character, Christian Grey's behavior out of context it would appear extremely alarming rather than alluring. She said: 'Is it romantic when somebody tracks your phone, when somebody knows where you live before you tell them, sells your only means of transport, or buys the company you work for? 'How can you marry that with being romantic?' Ms Collins, who is a consultant working to end the abuse of women, said that after reading all three books, she was left 'deeply concerned about the amount of domestic violence that was being romanticised and celebrated'. She added: 'The thing that I would say to people who are reading the books, who are going to see it, is, if he wasn't rich and very attractive, would this behaviour be normal?' The group asked users to take photos of placards that explain why the story is offensive to them, beginning with 'Fifty Shades is...' One photo sees a victim holding up a sign that says: 'Fifty Shades is...telling survivors that what happened to us is really just ""romance""'. A handful of men and women stood outside the central London premiere in Leicester Square today, holding placards and chanting slogans . Proof? The Twitter account posted this picture where a reader had folded down all the pages in the trilogy of  novels where there was abuse mentioned, and the result was shocking . Distasteful: Victims of domestic violence say that EL James' book trivialises what they have been through . The group doesn't wish to censor, they want to make viewers and readers aware of the concerning themes . Amid the protests, some Fifty Shades fans dressed up and spanked each other as they waited outside the cinema . Another says: 'Fifty Shades is... giving the dangerous impression that unwanted control, manipulation and stalking are forms of love.' She also criticised 'exploitative' retailers who had taken advantage of the franchise's popularity and created branded merchandising to cash in on the publicity. The books, written by EL James, follow the sado-masochistic sexual relationship between the two protagonists, Seattle billionaire Christian Grey and demure student Anastasia Steele. Ms Collins said the campaign group were not against the sexual nature of the book but there were other far more worrying themes in the novel . 'We are not against BDSM (bondage, discipline, sadism and masochism), it is the other issues in the books and films which we say glamorise domestic violence. 'I have spoken to people who have said that he (Christian Grey) was abused as a child and that is why he is the way he is. 'It is also very dangerous to suggest that people abuse because of their childhood and that women can fix broken men with enough love.' Ms Collins said the aim of the protest is not to prevent people from seeing the film but to make viewers aware of what they are ignoring. Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan share a joke as they arrive at the London premiere this evening . Shelley Hicks (left) and Maria Smith slept in Leicester Square last night in an attempt to catch a glimpse of the stars at the premiere . Die-hard enthusiasts slept out overnight with others arriving before sunrise. But the film has failed to get critics hot under the collar . 'It is not about censorship - people have the absolute right to go and watch it - but there is something about the credibility that is given by the number of people who go and watch it.' She further expressed her concerns that the franchise has become part of everyday life, with some cinemas even hosting 'mummy and baby screenings'. Die-hard Fifty Shades enthusiasts slept out overnight, with others arriving before sunrise today, hoping to be first in the queue to catch a glimpse of the stars as they arrived at the premiere. After endless hype, excitement hit fever pitch at the film's world premiere in Berlin last night, as screaming fans scrambled to get a selfie on the red carpet with stars Jamie Dornan and Dakota Johnson, who play Christian Grey and his lover Anastasia Steele. The film is also expected to be a hit at the box office, with more than £1million in ticket sales a week before it opens.

"Yesterday  SpaceX’s Dragon capsule returned to Earth in the Pacific Ocean off the coast of Baja California. The unmanned vehicle was returning from the ISS, carrying with it about 4,000lbs (1,800kg) of cargo including science experiments and equipment. And, in a stunning image, the capsule was spotted above Earth before it made its way back through the atmosphere. Scroll down for video . This amazing image shows the moments after the Dragon capsule was released from the ISS before returning to Earth early yesterday morning.  The SpaceX  spacecraft was detached from the ISS on 10 Feb by Expedition 42 crewmembers Samantha Cristoforetti of Esa and Terry Virts of Nasa using the robotic arm on the station . The image, taken at 0044 GMT (1944 EST)shows the Dragon capsule flying free above a coastline, with its solar panels extended and its service module still attached. When the spacecraft begins to enter the atmosphere, both the panels and the service module are jettisoned. This is because they cannot survive the temperatures of re-entry, while the top capsule can - it is designed to bring cargo back from the ISS to Earth. Ultimately, a modified version of Dragon will begin taking astronauts to and from the ISS, possibly as early as 2017. Dragon splashed down about 260 miles (420km) southwest of Long Beach, California after a journey of about five and a half hours from the ISS. Its return overlapped with the company’s Falcon 9 launch from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida, which took place last night. This latest Dragon mission was SpaceX’s fifth scheduled cargo mission to the ISS under contract with Nasa, and the seventh flight overall of the Dragon spacecraft. The mission launched on 10 January 2015 atop a Falcon 9 rocket and arrived at the ISS on 12 January. It brought with it more than 5,100lbs (2,300kg) or cargo, including provisions for the crew, science equipment and something called the Cloud Aerosol Transport System (Cats) - which will measure pollution in Earth’s atmosphere. The image of Dragon was taken above the coast line of Salalah in Oman, shown above, David MacLean of Centre of Geographic Sciences told MailOnline . The Dragon capsule is one of only two unmanned spacecraft that can return cargo from the ISS to Earth, the other being Russia's Progress vehicle. Parachutes are used to help the Dragon touch down in the Pacific Ocean, shown in these images . After landing the Dragon capsule was successfully taken on board a vessel, shown in this image. The cargo will now be inspected to ensure everything returned to Earth in working order . Astronauts Samantha Cristoforetti (left) and Terry Virts, who operated the station's robotic arm from the cupola, watch as the SpaceX Dragon spacecraft detaches from the station and disappears towards the planet. It was SpaceX's fifth successful cargo mission to the ISS . DSCOVR (pronounced discover) is designed to provide advance warnings of solar outbursts that could disrupt life here on Earth. It will spend nearly four months traveling one million miles (1.6 million km), four times farther than the moon, to the so-called Lagrange point, a gravity-neutral position in direct line with the sun. At this lookout location, 92 million miles (148 million km) from the sun, it will provide advance warnings of incoming geomagnetic storms that could disrupt power and communications on Earth. The steady stream of Earth pictures, meanwhile, is expected to be high on the 'wow' factor. The observatory's camera will provide the first snapshots of the entire home planet, its full face lit by the sun, since Nasa's final Apollo moon-landing in 1972. Subsequent Earth views have been stitched together from multiple images. The launch of this mission also saw SpaceX attempt, for the first time, to land the first stage of the Falcon 9 rocket on a floating barge. The attempt was partially successful, with the rocket crash landing after running out of fuel - but almost hitting its target perfectly. A second attempt was to be made on the launch of the Falcon 9 rocket yesterday on what was a busy day for SpaceX, but the landing had to be aborted after the barge was battered by high winds and waves. Instead, the first stage of the Falcon 9 rocket performed a successful precision landing in the ocean to further refine the technology - although, of course, with no barge the rocket was left to sink into the sea. The next attempt will not be until April, which will be the next Falcon 9 rocket that will be fitted with the landing legs necessary to make a landing attempt. The launch, however, passed without a hitch. The unmanned Falcon 9 rocket blasted off at 1103 GMT from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida in perfect weather conditions. It carried with it Noaa's £220 million ($340 million) Deep Space Climate Observatory (DSCOVR), the first deep-space mission for SpaceX. DSCOVR replaces a 17-year-old satellite monitoring for potentially dangerous solar storms, which can disrupt GPS signals, block radio communications and impact power grids on Earth. It will take DSCOVR 110 days to reach its operational orbit around the sun, where it will serve as a weather buoy, providing about an hour's advance notice of threatening solar activity. DSCOVR also has two sensors to monitor Earth to track volcanic plumes, measure ozone and monitor droughts, flooding and fires. Shown is the moment the first stage of the rocket separated yesterday.

"You may have played with Transformers as a child, but now there’s a serious boy’s toy in the form of a shape-shifting speedboat. At the touch of a button, the Kormaran can transform from a standard speedboat into a twin-hull catamaran or even three-hull trimaran. The 21ft (6.4metre) vessel, which is backed by Porsche, uses hydraulic rams to change into six shapes. At the touch of a button, the Kormaran can transform from a standard speedboat into a twin-hull catamaran (illustrated) or even three-hull trimaran . It is made from carbon fibre, titanium, teak and leather and claims to be the first of its kind in the world. The vessel is able to 'fly' above the water using hydrofoils at speeds of almost 45mph (72kph) and three jets mean it can travel 100miles (161km) at full throttle. For more leisurely trips, it can be turned into an extravagant bathing platform. The 21ft (6.4metre) vessel is made from carbon fibre, titanium, teak and leather and claims to be the first of its kind in the world. It can adopt six different shapes in total, including a three-hull trimaran (illustrated) ‘The Kormaran is the first of its kind in the world. We have not just developed a new boat, we have invented a new boat class,’ said Florian Schrems, spokesman for the Austrian firm.

"Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned, the 17th Century saying goes. And one wife, hell-bent on revenge for her husband's philandering, has proved it is as true today as when first coined more than 300 years ago. Furious with her cheating husband, Delores Cureton used a gun and a hammer to smash up his Lincoln Town Car as it sat in the driveway of their home in York County, South Carolina. A scorned wife used a gun and a hammer to smash her philandering husband's car after finding out he had been cheating on her in York County, South Carolina . The 61-year-old woman pulled up to the house in her own vehicle before getting into her husband's to smash the windows and taillights . The 61-year-old's partner, John Cureton, was inside the house with another woman at the time, police were told. She was arrested for criminal domestic violence despite her husband's decision not to press charges. According to kvs12.com, Mrs Cureton pulled up outside the house in her own vehicle in a violent rage. She then got into her husband's car where he stored a gun in the glovebox. Afraid of being shot, Mr Cureton stood back as his wife tried to load the weapon, he said. Mrs Cureton then fetched a hammer from her own truck to begin smashing the taillights and windows of her husband's car before passing out. When police arrived the woman was clutching a blood-soaked towel.

"Ed Miliband could be propelled into Downing Street even if he loses the election – by the Scottish nationalists. Their leader, Nicola Sturgeon, yesterday threatened to defy the verdict of voters in most of the UK, doing a deal with Labour even if it has fewer seats than the Conservatives. She also suggested she would demand a debt-fuelled £180billion public spending spree if she holds the balance of power at Westminster. The SNP surge, which looks set to see it make an unprecedented Commons breakthrough in May, is fast becoming the major factor of the general election. Scroll down for video . Powerful partner: With the SNP willing to do a deal with the Labour Party, its leader Ed Miliband (pictured) could become the country's next Prime Minister even if the party lose the 2015 general election . Panic is mounting within the Labour Party at a recent poll by Lord Ashcroft suggesting it is facing a meltdown in Scotland at the hands of the SNP – to which it could lose 35 seats. Calls are growing for Labour's 40 Scottish MPs, including its election chief Douglas Alexander, to head North to try to ensure they are re-elected. Miss Sturgeon, Scotland's First Minister, yesterday said SNP MPs will do everything in their power to kick David Cameron out of office if there is another hung parliament. No party which came second in a general election has formed a government since 1924, but the constitution does not prevent an alliance of smaller parties joining forces to form a majority. Yesterday, making her third visit to London in as many weeks, Miss Sturgeon set out further conditions for propping up a minority Labour administration. She claimed that austerity had failed and called for a £180billion spending boost across the UK – derailing plans to tackle the deficit. She even demanded a return to 'Old Labour' socialist-style policies, urging a 'more progressive' approach that would reverse attempts by the Coalition to get the benefits bill under control. Last night, the Tories accused the Scottish nationalists of attempting to 'bankrupt' the UK. Motive: Scotland's First Minister and SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon (right) has said her party will do everything in their power to kick current PM David Cameron (left) out of office . Conservative Party chairman Grant Shapps said: 'Now we know the price that the SNP would charge to support Ed Miliband ... a bill of £180billion paid for by hard-working taxpayers.' The Tories' chief whip in Scotland, John Lamont, added: 'First the SNP tried to break up Britain, now it wants to bankrupt Britain.' Miss Sturgeon, who insists she would lead post-election negotiations rather than former leader Alex Salmond, has ruled out any deal with the Tories. In an interview with Sky News, she was asked specifically if she could 'support Ed Miliband in Downing Street even if he led the second largest party?' Miss Sturgeon replied: 'If he was able with the support on an issue-by-issue basis of SNP MPs to put together a majority, then he would be able to put together a majority. 'I hope Scotland can again exert a beneficial and progressive influence on developments here in London ... We'll make the case in a way that perhaps Labour parties of old would have made more emphatically than they do now.'","SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon hinted at forming a coalition with Labour Party .

"Former San Diego Chargers quarterback Jesse Freitas has been found dead in a parked car in Northern California. Petaluma police Lt. Dan Fish said an investigation found no indication of trauma or foul play. An autopsy was performed Tuesday but authorities were awaiting the results from toxicology tests before making a final determination, Fish said. Freitas, who ran into legal troubles in recent years, was found unresponsive in his vehicle Sunday by a family walking in a Petaluma neighborhood, The Santa Rosa Press Democrat reported. Former San Diego Chargers quarterback Jesse Freitas, who ran into legal troubles in recent years, was found unresponsive in his vehicle Sunday by a family walking in a Petaluma neighborhood . Freitas, 63, was fully clothed and on his back with his left arm across his chest, as if he had been lying down to take a nap or rest. Freitas apparently had come to the area to meet with a real estate agent in the neighborhood but missed the appointment, Fish said. 'It's very likely he was there waiting for an appointment with a real estate agent and he laid down in back of (the) car with (the) door open and died from an unknown cause,' he added. Freitas grew up in San Mateo and was drafted by the Chargers in 1974. Over the next two seasons, he played in 13 games and threw eight touchdowns as a backup to Hall of Famer Dan Fouts. Freitas, 63, was fully clothed and on his back with his left arm across his chest, as if he had been lying down to take a nap or rest . After those pro football days, Freitas' behavior was at times erratic and he was arrested for crimes including petty theft, hit-and-run, trespassing and violating restraining orders. His family has said he struggled with mental illness. Freitas' family agreed to the coroner's suggestion to have Freitas' brain analyzed to see if he was suffering from traumatic shock that occurs from football injuries, said the player's younger brother, James Freitas, of Rancho Penasquitos in Southern California.","Authorities were awaiting the results from toxicology tests before making a final determination .

"UKIP supporters in Rotherham have been driving around in a pickup truck covered in anti-European slogans with a number plate containing the letters 'EEC'. The 2001 Nissan 2.5 diesel pick up truck was spotted carrying a large triangular sign around the Yorkshire town featuring the embarrassing number plate in advance of a visit by party leader Nigel Farage. The rear of the truck featured an unflattering photograph of German Chancellor Angela Merkel, above a slogan claiming 'Vote Labour Get Merkel'. Scroll down for video . Ukip supporters in Rotherham prepared for a visit by party leader Nigel Farage in a 2001 Nissan pickup truck carrying anti-EU slogans but featuring the letters EEC on its number plate . The pickup truck, pictured,  featured slogans attacking Ed Miliband, David Cameron and Angela Merkel . The Ukip leader wanted to visit Rotherham as it is one of his party's main targets in the north of England . The left-hand-side of the truck had a photograph of Prime Minister David Cameron photoshopped onto a chicken beside the words: 'Come on David, Let's Talk About Broken Promises On Immigration.' The opposite side had a photograph of a gagged Ed Miliband featuring 'No Voice For The Working Man'. The truck was spotted otuside the UKIP campaign headquarters of their parliamentary hopeful Jane Collins. Vice-chairman of the Ukip's Rotherham branch John Wilkinson told Mail Online that the number plate should not offend his party's supporters. 'The EEC no longer exists so I don't think that this is an issue. It disappeared with the introduction of the European Union. I have no idea about the vehicle as it does not belong to me. 'It belongs to someone from another Ukip branch who came to Rotherham to provide support for Nigel's visit.' Protesters congregated outside the office of Ukip's Rotherham hopeful Jane Collins to greet Nigel Farage . Nigel Farage had to be ushered out of the Ukip office in Rotherham after protesters objected to his visit . Among the protesters present at the demonstration was a woman breast feeding her child, centre . The Ukip leader visited Rotherham last week where he was confronted by a large group of protesters and was forced to remain inside the party's new office in the town. South Yorkshire police told Mr Farage that he should remain inside after the anti-Ukip demonstrators congregated outside the office. After almost two hours he was led to safety under a large red umbrella. Rotherham is one of the party's main target seats in the north of England after they returned 10 councillors in the last local elections. The party is campaigning heavily on the handling of the Rotherham grooming scandal. Following the demonstration, a Ukip statement said: 'These protesters aren't the real people of Rotherham. This is the Labour Party running scared and trying to shut down any voice of opposition. 'They are just people who are trying to stifle democratic debate. Surely they should be directing their anger at those who presided over the industrial scale of abuse in this town, rather than those who are trying to change it for the better.

"Some airline passengers stuck waiting on the tarmac at the Seattle airport were treated to a soothing serenade courtesy of members of the city orchestra. Alaska Airlines flight 550 passengers en route to Palm Springs, California on Sunday had made it as far as the runway when their plane was turned around and sent back to the gate due to technical issues. While the irritable travelers waited, they were treated to some comforting musing from a string quartet that just happened to be on board with their instruments. Impromptu: Members of the Seattle Symphony serenaded irritable passengers as they waited at the gate for their delayed flight to take off . Delighted: Passengers were delighted by the brief distraction as they waited to fly to Palm Springs . 'We were lucky to be sitting amongst a string quartet who broke out their instruments and played for us,' said passenger Addie Bogart. According to KING, Seattle Symphony violinsists Mikhail Shmidt and Elisa Barston, violist Susan Gulkis Assadi and cellist Walter Gray were behind the impromptu concert.

"Ed Miliband yesterday promised to increase the education budget every year – and echoed Tony Blair’s landmark 1997 election pledge to keep primary class sizes to a maximum of 30. Mr Miliband told an audience at his old secondary school that if he wins office in May, spending on education will benefit from a ‘real terms’ increase every year of the next Parliament. He accused David Cameron of planning to inflict ‘big cuts in spending’ which would ‘short change our children’s future’ if he is elected for a second term. Labour leader Ed Miliband promised to create thousands of new school places in England to cap class sizes for five, six and seven year olds . But the Labour leader’s promises were already unravelling last night as the Institute for Fiscal Studies think-tank suggested that the Labour and Tory plans came to virtually the same amount of money, with the Conservatives potentially spending even more. Mr Miliband announced he would put £180million a year into capping class sizes at 30 pupils for five to seven year-olds. Mr Blair, in his five-point pledge card for the 1997 election, had promised to cap class sizes at 30, and laws to ban classes bigger than this were enacted in 2001. But by 2006 it emerged that nearly 30,000 pupils in 910 infant classes were being taught in groups larger than the legal limit, although Labour claimed at the time that the number of pupils taught in oversized groups had fallen by 477,000 between 1997 and 2006. Mr Miliband has blamed the Coalition for allowing the number of young primary school pupils in classes of more than 30 to treble from 31,265 to 93,345 in four years. Exceptions are only meant to be permitted in special circumstances such as to allow twins to be in the same class, or Armed Forces children to get a place at their local school. Mr Miliband said that to take account of these exceptions, Labour would ban class sizes of more than 30 for any longer than 12 months. He said the 30-pupil cap would be delivered by halting the creation of new free schools in areas where there are already state schools for children to attend. The Labour leader, speaking at Haverstock School in North London, said education ‘is the passport to success in life’, adding: ‘The next Labour government will protect the overall education budget. Rising budgets, protected in real terms, every year.’ The move is part of Labour's plan for education in England, including the appointment of new local 'directors of standards' to drive up schools' performance . Mr Miliband set our his education plans in a speech at his old school, Haverstock School, in north London . He won praise from teachers’ unions, but the Conservatives claimed that their spending plans, outlined by Mr Cameron last week, would actually involve spending more over the next five years. The Prime Minister said he would keep the amount of funding per pupil – around £4,200 a year in primary school and £5,300 for secondary pupils – the same for the period. This amounts to a real-terms cut per pupil, because it takes no account of rising inflation. But the schools budget will go up because the number of schoolchildren aged between five and 15 will rise by 7 per cent in the next five years. The Conservatives say this means they will spend £204.62billion on schools in the next Parliament, while Labour would spend slightly less at £204.03billion. A spokesman for the Institute for Fiscal Studies said the policies ‘present different risks. If inflation is higher than expected then a cash freeze per pupil could be less generous. If the number of pupils increases by much more than expected, then it would be the other way around’. The IFS said the Tories have only promised to protect schools at age five to 16, not early years or sixth form, giving Labour flexibility to spend more in these areas.","Ed Miliband leader uses speech at his old school in Camden to echo Tony Blair’s landmark 1997 election pledge .

"Ed and David Miliband, pictured,  used a controversial tax-avoidance scheme to reduce the amount of inheritance tax they owed . Ed Miliband was forced to defend his own tax affairs yesterday after being accused of benefiting from a controversial tax-avoidance scheme. The Labour leader has spent the week lambasting ‘tax dodgers’ in the wake of the HSBC scandal, but he now faces questions over his own family’s practices. Mr Miliband and his family used a ‘deed of variation’ to divide the ownership of the family home in North London. These legal documents – which change the terms of someone’s will after they have died – are used almost exclusively to reduce death duty bills in a legal form of tax avoidance. Deeds of variation were described as ‘tax abuse’ by Gordon Brown when he was Chancellor. Last night, Mr Miliband was urged to ‘come clean’ and answer ‘serious questions’ over the deal, which could have potentially saved the Labour leader and his brother David thousands of pounds. Both brothers deny any wrongdoing and say they have paid all the tax owed. But the row is a major embarrassment to Ed Miliband in a week in which he has attacked the Conservatives over tax avoidance as the row over the HSBC tax scandal deepened. At an event at his old school, Haverstock School in North London, Mr Miliband was forced to defend his own complex arrangements. Asked if he thought it was ‘dodgy to use what’s called in the trade a deed of variation, to leave your house to your children that avoids tax’, the Labour leader said: ‘The deed of variation issue is something directed at me personally, it’s something that my mother did 20 years ago, that was a decision she made. ‘Let me just say this: I paid tax as a result of that transaction, I’ve avoided no tax in that. No doubt the Conservative Party wants to smear mud today but frankly it’s not going to work. The story has been written before and I have paid tax on that money.’ After the death of Ralph Miliband in 1994, his will was changed to make Ed, David and their mother Marion part-owners of the family home. It meant that, in the event of their mother’s death, part of the estate would already be in the hands of her sons. This would mean inheritance tax would be levied on only 60 per cent of the value of the home, reducing the bill. In 1994, Mr Brown included the scheme among ‘tax abuses’ which he promised to stop if Labour was elected. The Miliband brothers are believed to have used a 'deed of variation' after the death of their father Ralph in 1994 which would have reduced the level of tax payable in the event of their mother Marion's death . Conservative MP Andrew Bridgen said last night: ‘Miliband needs to come clean and publish this deed of variation. There are still a number of very serious questions he needs to answer about his own tax arrangements.’ He added: ‘Ed Miliband is trying to stand on what he thinks is the moral high ground, but it looks increasingly swampy. One can only presume he entered into it on the advice of some accountants that this was the best thing to do. He needs to come clean on the reasons for that.’ The Milibands’ deal centres on a four-storey Georgian terrace house in fashionable Primrose Hill, North London – now thought to be worth about £2.4 million. When Ralph Miliband died in 1994 aged 70, he left ‘most’ of his estate, valued at £349,000 not including the house, to his wife. Marion, Ed and David agreed on a ‘deed of variation’ which transferred 40 per cent of the equity of the home to the sons, who were each given a 20 per cent share. It is understood Marion sought professional advice before doing so. Accountants say this type of agreement is almost always drawn up to reduce a family’s total death duty bill. They can be drawn up at any time up to two years after the death of the parent. This meant that when Mrs Miliband dies, a slice of the estate is already in the hands of her sons and thus inheritance tax would be levied on only 60 per cent of the value of the home, potentially saving the brothers thousands. The main reason for a deed of variation, according to a government website, is to ‘reduce the amount of inheritance or capital gains tax payable’. The Miliband brothers may not have been party to the deed of variation, as rules state it must only be ‘signed by all the people who would lose out because of it’. Under current rules, a deed of variation must contain a statement confirming if the signatories ‘intend’ it to impact on ‘inheritance tax and/or capital gains tax’. In the event, David Miliband later bought his brother’s and mother’s share of the property. Land Registry documents show he paid £800,000 in August 2004 and it became home for him, his wife Louise and their two sons. The property was reportedly independently valued to ensure Ed and Marion received a fair deal. It meant Ed Miliband would have received £200,000 for his 20 per cent share, on which he paid capital gains tax. Ed Miliband, left, photographed with his father Ralph, right in  Edis Street, London around 1989 . A Labour spokesman: ‘Ed paid 40 per cent of capital gains tax when the house was sold in 2004-5. It can’t be tax avoidance if no tax was avoided.’ The house is now being rented out following David Miliband’s move to New York in 2013. The average property value in the area is £2,121,591, according to Zoopla. Five years ago, Ed Miliband had to insist he was not a tax dodger over his other properties – when it emerged his name was absent from the title deeds of his £1.6 million home. The Victorian townhouse where the Labour leader lives with his wife and their sons was bought in 2009 solely by Justine Thornton when she was his girlfriend. Analysts claimed he and Miss Thornton could have legitimately avoided tens of thousands of pounds in capital gains tax, thanks to being unmarried at the time, over the sale of their previous flats before moving in together. Frank Nash, a tax partner at accountants Blick Rothenberg who specialises in high net worth individuals and families, said of deeds of variation: ‘Before 2007 they would have largely been used to reduce the tax bill… to make the will more tax efficient than it otherwise would have been. ‘You have to say that a deed of variation can be beneficial for tax purposes, but it does have a real economic effect on the family. It can have a tax advantage, but I have seen just as many cases to sort out family rows, so it serves two purposes equally.’","Miliband family used a a tax-avoidance scheme follow their father's death .

"A 15-year-old grammar school pupil threw herself in front of a train after sending a text to her friend to say 'I'm sorry, I love you,' an inquest heard. Jade Emily Kosanlavit, from the Wirral, Merseyside, had been receiving treatment for depression for two months following a previous suicide attempt when she jumped in front of a train just minutes from her family home. The Wirral Grammar School for Girls' student, who was described by her teachers as a 'talented and hardworking pupil', died just before 10.30am on November 10 last year. Jade Emily Kosanlavit, 15 (pictured), from Merseyside, had been receiving treatment for depression for two months following a previous suicide attempt when she jumped in front of a train in November last year . An inquest into her death at the Gerard Majella Courthouse in Liverpool yesterday heard from British Transport Police officers who described seeing the schoolgirl running towards an oncoming  train. The driver applied the emergency brake but it took 40 yards for the train to stop, the coroner heard. The teenager suffered multiple injuries, including spinal fractures, and was pronounced dead at the scene. The talented schoolgirl's mother, Wanpen, arrived at the station a short time after the incident, having heard the tragic news, and confirmed it was her daughter. A mobile phone and handwritten note were found in Jade's pocket. Details of the note's contents were not read out in court as to preserve Jade's privacy but British Transport Police said it expressed her wish to die. A text message sent to her friend at 10.12am - about 10 minutes prior to her death - said: 'I'm sorry it has to end this way, I love you'. The court heard that Jade had been prescribed  a form of antidepressants following an earlier incident on September 30 last year. Jade Emily Kosanlavit (left) left a handwritten note in her pocket which expressed her wish to die, officers told the inquest. Floral tributes and cuddly toys were left at the scene in the wake of her death last year (right) British Transport Police officers told the inquest that they saw Jade running towards an oncoming train after jumping off the Liverpool-bound platform at Port Sunlight station in Merseyside and into its path (pictured) Concerns were raised by her family about the medication, which has been linked to suicides in the past, but Mr Rebello said he could not say if Jade's death would have happened had she not been taking them. He added that he was satisfied the medication was prescribed in accordance with what is expected in child and adolescent psychiatry across England. Mr Rebello said notes and drawings by Jade were 'poignant' and difficult reading. He said the investigation goes far broader than what would be appropriate to share in court, adding that Jade's wishes for privacy should be respected. He said: 'What happened to Jade is very difficult to get your head around - this very young life ending in this way. 'Jade suffered from a mental health depressive illness which had manifestations of intentional self-harm. She had been prescribed [anti-depressants] and supportive therapy. 'I am satisfied that Jade intentionally took her own life while suffering from a depressive illness.' Mr Rebello said it was important that Jade be remembered for who she was and not to let her tragic death 'overshadow the beauty of her life'. Jade, a Year 11 pupil at Wirral Grammar School for Girls (pictured), was described as 'hardworking and talented'. The school said she had a strong friendship group and would be 'remembered as a gifted musician' Following the inquest, John Johnson - Jade's mother's former partner - said: 'I absolutely adored her, I loved her so much and was so proud of her. 'I brought her up like she was my daughter, I just hope she rests in peace now.' Following Jade's death, teachers and friends from Wirral Grammar School for Girls paid tribute to popular student. Headteacher Elaine Cogan said: 'It is with great regret and sadness that we learned of Jade's death, she was a talented and hardworking pupil at the school. 'Jade was an articulate and gifted Year 11 pupil, popular with both pupils' and staff alike. Jade had a strong friendship group at school and received strong and unwavering support at home. 'She had a great love of music and will be particularly remembered as a gifted musician. 'Jade was an accomplished player of three instruments, took an active role in school recitals and music evenings, and recently toured Austria to perform with music department. 'There is a strong sense of loss across the whole school.'

"Hates yoga pants: Republican Rep. David Moore on Tuesday introduced House Bill 365, which would ban any garment that 'simulates' buttocks, genitals or nipples . A Montana lawmaker is seeking to strengthen the state's indecent exposure law, in part because he hates seeing yoga pants worn in public. Rep. David Moore on Tuesday introduced House Bill 365 in the House Judiciary Committee in response to a group of naked bicyclists who rolled through Missoula in August. The proposal would expand indecent exposure law to include any nipple exposure, including men's, and any garment that 'gives the appearance or simulates' a person's buttocks, genitals, pelvic area or female nipple. The Republican from Missoula said tight-fitting beige clothing could be considered indecent exposure under his proposal. 'Yoga pants should be illegal in public anyway,' Moore said after the hearing. Moore said he wouldn't have a problem with people being arrested for wearing provocative clothing but that he'd trust law enforcement officials to use their discretion. He couldn't be sure whether police would act on that provision or if Montana residents would challenge it. 'I don't have a crystal ball,' Moore said. Moore and Walt Hill, a retired professor in Missoula, initiated the drafting of HB 365 after the Bare as you Dare bicycle event outraged some residents last summer. Fearing that denying organizers an event permit would breach free speech, city officials allowed participants, many of them completely nude, to ride through downtown Missoula on August 17, 2014. 'I want Montana to be known as a decent state where people can live within the security of laws and protect their children and associates from degrading and indecent practices,' Hill said Tuesday in support of the measure. 'I believe this bill is written preserving that reputation.' 'Yoga pants should be illegal in public anyway,' Moore said after Tuesday's hearing . In 1991, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Barnes v. Glen Theatre Inc. that state prohibitions on public nudity are constitutional given that nudity in itself is not an expression. Bare as you Dare organizers call the event a celebration of body image and bicyclists' right to use public roads. Rep. Virginia Court, D-Billings, said she is concerned that the provision prohibiting garments showing the outline or appearance of a woman's nipple unfairly targets women. 'I think you are kind of being a little prejudiced against women,' Court said. Currently, a person convicted of indecent exposure three times could be sentenced to life in jail and up to $10,000. In an effort to promote enforcement of the law, Moore said, the bill lessens that sentencing to not more than five years in jail and $5,000. A first offense for violating Montana's indecent exposure law carries a fine of no more than $500 and six months in jail. A second offense carries up to $1,000 or one year in jail. Those punishments are unchanged in Moore's bill.","Republican Rep. David Moore on Tuesday introduced House Bill 365, which would ban any garment that 'simulates' buttocks, genitals or nipples ."
"The taxpayer is paying for a limousine to drive Michael Gove just 440 yards between Downing Street and Parliament. The Chief Whip is regularly ferried the short distance using a £100,000 government car service so he can attend meetings in Number 10. Mr Gove, who was sacked as Education Secretary last year, defended the use of the car insisting it would be carrying classified government papers even if he is not sat on the back seat . Chief Whip Michael Gove is regularly ferried the short distance using a £100,000 government car service so he can attend meetings in Number 10 . Mr Gove was captured by the Daily Mirror taking just 73 seconds to travel 440 yards in his silver Jaguar from Parliament to Downing Street. Many Cabinet ministers arrive in Downing Street on foot, after the coalition cut the budget for ministerial cars. But Mr Gove is frequently seen stepping out of his car, often clutching newspapers and coffee cups. Labour MP Grahame Morris told the Mirror: 'The Tories preach austerity while wasting taxpayers' cash. Seeing Michael Gove use his chauffeur-driven car, even if he's only going down the road, shows they revel in the trappings of office while others struggle to make ends meet.' But a spokesman for Mr Gove said that he was simply following 'standard Cabinet Office protocol' for ministers when they are carrying sensitive official papers. 'This is a total non-story. As Chief Whip, Michael Gove carries sensitive papers and the rules are these have to be transported securely,' the spokesman said. 'Government cars often make short journeys like this to transport papers even if there is no minister in them. The Chief Whip has followed the standard Cabinet Office protocol and will continue to do so.' Mr Gove, left, regularly uses the his car to travel to and from the House of Commons where he is often to be seen sitting on the government frontbench . A Cabinet Office spokesman said: 'On each of these occasions, the car contained highly-classified papers which had to be transported from Downing Street to the House of Commons. 'The ministerial code is clear that official cars can be used to transport classified documents which must be handled securely. 'Therefore, these journeys had to be made regardless of whether the Chief Whip was in the car himself.' The government boasted it had cut the cost of cars for ministers by 44 per cent in the first year of the coalition. The number of ministers who have access to an official car was cut from 78 to 13, with some Cabinet ministers forced to share cars or take the bus.","Chief Whip driven short distances using £110,000 government car service .

"A decade before Gone Girl, the nation was captivated by a strikingly similar story of an adulterous husband who killed his pregnant wife in cold blood. But this wasn't any crime novel - it was a real-life horror. Scott Peterson was found guilty in 2003 of murdering his wife Laci and their unborn son Conner, and it was Peterson's mistress Amber Frey that helped put him behind bars. Now, ten years later, Frey is speaking out about her relationship with Peterson and how she has tried to distance herself from the infamous case. Scroll down for video . Dark times: Amber Frey (pictured) spoke to Inside Edition this week about her relationship with Scott Peterson, who was sentenced to death ten years ago for the murder of his wife Laci Peterson . Scary situation: Frey started dating Peterson (left) around the time that his wife Laci (right) went missing. Laci's remains, as well as those of their unborn child, were discovered in April 2013 and her husband was arrested . Above, a picture of Frey (right) and Peterson (left) during their short courtship. When Peterson was arrested, they found knives, a shovel and direction's to Frey's work in his car - suggesting she might be his next target . Frey spoke with Inside Edition on February 10 - her 40th birthday - and revealed that she is now a single mom to a young daughter and son and is still working as a massage therapist. She also travels doing missionary work for her church. As for her feelings about Peterson, she says those are long gone. 'That was put behind me so many years ago,' Frey said. When asked if she has anything left to say to Peterson, Frey responds: 'I really don't have anything to say.' New life: Today, Frey is a single mother to two young children and often travels the world performing charity for her church . But the case continues to haunt her. 'It didn't matter if I had a hat on, glasses, people still recognized me years later.' Frey started dating Peterson during the 2002 holidays, right around the time that his wife Laci went missing on Christmas Eve. When they first met Frey was under the impression that Peterson wasn't married. But she soon found out that he was and that his wife was missing. She agreed to help police in their investigation by having her phone conversations recorded. Too close: Frey was a witness in Peterson's murder trial. She helped investigators by recording her conversations with Peterson when he was just a suspect. Pictured on the left promoting a book about the experience. Peterson's 2011 mugshot on the right . It wasn't until April though that Peterson was arrested in connection to her murder, when the butchered parts of Laci and her fetus' body parts washed up on the San Francisco Bay shoreline. Perhaps most jarring was the fact that when Peterson was arrested, he had changed his entire look and was found driving a car packed with knives, a shovel and directions to Frey's workplace - suggesting that she might be his next target. 'It was creepy,' Frey recalls. Peterson is currently on death row, after a jury found him guilty in Laci's murder in 2004, but he is currently appealing the decision.","Frey began dating Scott Peterson around the time his wife Laci went missing .

The film is also  expected to be a hit at the box office, with more than £1 million in ticket sales a week before it opens. Excited crowds have already gathered ahead of this evening as the film premieres in the UK at the Odeon Leicester Square in central London. But it has failed to get critics hot under the collar. Most scathing was Peter Bradshaw in The Guardian, who gave it one star, describing the film as 'the most tasteful and softcore depiction of sadomasochism in cinema history' and branding the performances of its two main stars as 'strictly daytime soap'. Tim Robey, in the Telegraph, was more positive, awarding it four stars.

A man in a wig and grey face paint holds up a sign to author  E.L. James. The highly-anticipated film will hit cinemas on Friday February 13 and has already sold nearly £2 million worth of tickets . 'So how has it all worked out? Almost shockingly well, considering. It proves that age-old saw that great books rarely make great films, whereas barely literate junk can turn into something ripe and even electric on screen,' he said. 'The lead performances and sleek style choices sell it irresistibly to the target audience, but the film has the confidence to end bruisingly unresolved, with the structural equivalent of a slap in the face.' The Daily Star's Nadine Linge also gave it four stars but warned that with only three sex scenes 'viewers might feel short-changed'. 'Definitely a film for women. It might be released in time for Valentine's Day but leave the men at home. Go see it for a giggle and a swoon with the girls,' she wrote. David Edwards in the Daily Mirror opted to give it three stars, saying: 'It may not be the raciest film ever made but it's a classy and titillating adult drama, more steamy than scandalising.'

'Like porn for people who shop at Marks & Spencer,' he added. The Daily Mail's Jan Moir called it a 'spanking great bore', while Kaleem Aftab in the Independent attacked the 'clumsy stereotyping' and 'plotting that would have seemed light in a teen romance'. The Sun's Emma Brankin also picked out the lack of sex scenes, saying 'we only get a measly 11 minutes of sex' and saying the film 'takes itself way too seriously'. And Kate Muir, in the Times, said while the actors 'make a decent stab at their somewhat thinly written characters' the adaptation 'starts out hilarious, becomes ludicrous and is finally dubious'. Disappointment? Some critics have pointed out that there are no shots of genitalia in the film . Such is the expectation surrounding the film that firefighters in London have said they fear a rise in call-outs over people getting trapped in compromising situations as a result of the 'Fifty Shades' effect.

"The impact of global warming can already be seen in the habitats around us, according to a study that saw scientists run heaters outside for 23 years. Ecologists monitored the changes that took place in meadows in the Rocky Mountains and compared them to plots others that were artificially heated to simulate global warming. After more than two decades, they found that the unheated meadow plot as are now starting to resemble those that had changed quickly as a result of the artificial heating. The researchers studied meadows at the Rocky Mountain Biological Laboratory in Gothic, Colorado (above) The vegetation in the meadows shifted to become more woody while the soil became poorer quality. For years, scientists have predicted that as global warming heats the Earth, the number of storms will increase. But recent research suggests that rather than increasing in number, these storms will increase in intensity - meaning the same number of storms will occur, but they'll be stronger. The  physicists behind the study said that this is because global warming will directly affect how the atmosphere circulates air mass, heat and water using what has been dubbed 'Earth's heat engine.' Researchers from the University of Toronto used computer models to simulate how Earth and its atmosphere will change between 1982 to 2098. As a result of climate change, they predicted the atmosphere is expected to use more energy to cycle water around the heat engine. This is because an increase in water vapour will make the process less efficient. However, the atmosphere still needs to get rid of the precipitation it collects, but because circulation is affected, it has to do this in fewer, more intense storms. The researchers say these changes resemble those that are taking place in landscapes around the world due to global warming. However, to achieve their results, the experiment itself may have contributed to global warming. The scientists set up infrared heaters over the five meadow plots measuring 30 square metres (322 square feet). Left to run day and night, the heaters burned through more than 128,462 kilowatt hours of electricity. This means that the heaters produced around 78 tons of carbon dioxide during the life-time of the experiment - roughly the equivalent of driving an average family car 87 times around the world. By comparison, however, the average energy usage per capita in the US is 9,500 kilowatt hours a year. This means over the course of the same 23 year project, the average US citizen would used almost twice as much energy as was used to conduct the experiments - 218,500 kilowatt hours. Professor John Harte, an ecosystems scientist at the University of California, Berkeley, who led the study, said the round the clock heating was necessary to understand what the cause the changes in the unheated plots were. He said: 'The annual energy usage each year of the experiment is roughly comparable to the annual energy consumption by an average US resident. 'At a personal level I feel comfortable doing this because 15 years ago I put solar panels on my roof and I walk the two km to my university and back each day, never driving. 'Finally, of course, I justify it because the knowledge obtained provides considerable insight into the nature of the threat that the world faces.' The research, which is published in the journal Global Change Biology, was conducted at the Rocky Mountain Biologial Laboratory in Gothic, Colorado. It showed that in the past decade the unheated 'ambient' meadow plots started to change in the past decade. The heaters (seen above) caused snow to melt earlier but snow melt in unheated plots has begun to catch up . These graphs show the changes in non-woody plants (top) and woody shrubs (bottom) in the heated and unheated meadows over 23 years, revealing how climate change has altered the vegetation in unheated plots . Snow on these plots started to melt earlier while the growth and flowering of non-woody plants decreased. The researchers said woody shrubs increased on the plots and the levels of carbon in the soil also declined. This, they said, matched what had been observed in the meadow plots that had been heated, but at a far slower rate. Professor Harte and his colleagues Scott Saleska from the University of Arizona, Tucson, and Charlotte Levy, from Cornell University in Ithaca, said what was happening on these meadows matched what was occurring in the wider environment. Writing in the journal, they said: 'This allows us to infer that climate change is the cause of the observed shifts in ambient vegetation and soil carbon and that the vegetation responses mediate the observed changes in soil carbon. The heaters were left running day and night above five of the meadows in the Rocky Mountains (as shown above) to provide a way of attributing changes that occurred naturally in the unheated areas of the test site . This graph shows how carbon in the soil of unheated plots is starting to catch up with those in heated plots . 'The trends we observed over the last decade in the ambient plots are consistent with broader scale observations throughout western North America that indicate a reduction in carbon uptake due to recent drought as well as an increase in shrub production.' Professor Harte said that the experiments could also provide some clues about what the future could hold as the climate warms further. He told Mail Online: 'The heated plots have not yet achieved a new steady stat. 'Forb biomass (non-woody plants) is continuing to deline, shrub biomass is increasing. 'Soil carbon is slowly increasing as well and the heated plot snowmelt dates continue to come earlier because they are seeing not just the heaters but also the ambient warming trend.' The heated plots also tend to be 10-20 per cent dryer during the growing season and are snow free on avearge two weeks earlier. The heaters made the top 15 cm of soil around two degrees warmer than the surrounding area. Professor Harte added: 'With only control plot observations, it is very difficult to know what causes the observed trends. 'That is why scientists do controlled experiments - to see how a possible cause - in this case extra heating and extra early snowmelt - influence the system and thus be able to attribute changes to that causal factor.'","Scientists set up heaters above five plots in meadows in the Rockies .

"David Cameron today urged Greece to agree a swift deal with Brussels over its debts, warning that delays could worsen the impact on the British economy. The Prime Minister, who is in Brussels for talks with other EU leaders, called for 'not a stand-off but a solution' to the eurozone row. The summit is the first chance for him to meet new Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras for the first time, warning him that EU meetings 'can go on all night'. David Cameron today held talks with Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras for the first time, warning him that EU meetings 'can go on all night' The Prime Minister, arriving in Brussels for talks with other EU leaders, called for 'not a stand-off but a solution' to the eurozone row . The gathering of European leaders in Brussels is set to be dominated by economic concerns following the victory of the Greek radical anti-austerity party in elections last month. On Monday Mr Cameron convened a meeting in Downing Street with the Bank of England, the Treasury and the Foreign Office to prepare contingency plans in case Greece crashes out of the single currency. Mr Tsipras used his inaugural speech in parliament to insist his demand for restructuring the country's debt is 'irrevocable.' Speaking as he arrived in Brussels for a one-day European Council summit, the Prime Minister said he was looking forward to his first meeting with Mr Tsipras. 'I will be saying that what is required between Greece and the eurozone is not a stand-off but a solution. 'The British economy is growing and succeeding but we are affected by the situation on the European continent and the longer this stand-off goes on the worse potentially that could be for Britain. 'That only underlines the importance of sticking to our long-term economic plan,' Mr Cameron added. At the weekend new Greek PM Alexis Tsipras  used his inaugural speech in parliament to insist his demand for restructuring the country's debt is 'irrevocable' Welcoming Mr Tsipras to his first European Council meeting, Mr Cameron warned him the meetings 'can go on all night and in to the next day'. Mr Tsipras arrived in Brussels this morning after his finance minister was involved in lengthy talks which ended in stalemate with European counterparts last night. Most of Greece's national debt is held by eurozone institutions and not by Britain, which could limit the impact if it defaults. But Downing Street has warned that there remain 'risks of contagion and uncertainty'. British officials said Mr Cameron would be in 'listening mode' in his meeting with Mr Tsipras, but was keen to hear the details of how he intended to get his country's economy growing and how he would tackle the crucial issue of Greece's debts. 'The Prime Minister's point will be this is not about us taking sides, it's down to Greece and eurozone partners to agree on the best way to move forward to get the Greek economy growing, to bring their debt down and get it on a sustainable footing,' a British official said. 'They need to work on this together but they need to be acting responsibly and coming up with a plan for growth. 'The point from the UK perspective is that the uncertainty around Greece is clearly a risk to our economy. We want Greece and eurozone partners to get on and sort this out.' French President Francois Hollande and Danish Prime Minister Helle Thorning Schmidt arriving at the Brussels summit . Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko arrives at the talks which will discuss attempts to broker a ceasefire with Russia . The talks between Mr Tsipras and his European counterparts will be a chance for the Greek leader to set out how he intends to implement the anti-austerity policies his Syriza party was swept to power on. The discussions will focus on the detail of the reforms necessary in Greece and the timetable for implementing the measures. Finnish prime minister Alexander Stubb warned that failure to reach an agreement would result in 'financial mayhem', but insisted he was confident a deal could be struck. 'There are basically two options here,' Mr Stubb told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. 'Number one is that Greece continues the programme and we give an extension to that programme. The other option, which I don't like personally, would be a so-called 'dirty exit', where Greece would be on its own trying to claw its way back to the markets. 'I think Greek banks would have great troubles, I think a lot of the deposits would flee the country and it would cause general financial mayhem, especially in Greece, with a slight ripple effect.' Mr Stubb said that Athens had undertaken to meet certain conditions in return for the loan of one billion euros, and he expected Greece to 'keep its bargain, regardless of the election result'. He added: 'The euro group of financial ministers are meeting and I think we are all expecting Greece to give a proposal by Monday next week. We will see what they come up with. I am sure a solution will be found at the end of the day.' European leaders will also consider counter-terrorism measures following the bloody events in Paris last month.","Cameron arrives in Brussels for first meeting with Greece's Alexis Tsipras .

"Boris Johnson has used a six-day, £25,000 jaunt to the US to present himself as an international statesman. But he has got some way to go to raise his profile stateside, after revealing he was stopped in the street by a New Yorker who thought he was another tousled haired blond: American tycoon Donald Trump. The London Mayor is trying to woo investors to the UK capital, but risked raising hackles with a claim that Americans secretly wish they were still ruled by the Queen of England. London Mayor Boris Johnson obviously still has some way to go to raise his profile stateside, after being stopped by someone who thought he was another tousled haired blond: Donald Trump . Mr Johnson has defended his globetrotting against claims he is a 'part-time mayor', arguing he is boosting business back home in London. He started in Boston at the beginning of the week and has been in New York meeting fashionistas including Alexa Chung. Appearing on LBC radio from the Big Apple, he was questioned by a New Yorker about his infamous mop of unruly blond hair. He insisted he has it styled that way, before revealing how it meant it was mistaken for Mr Trump during his visit. 'It's better than the other question I was asked by… I was walking down the street and then somebody was taking my photograph and a young woman stopped and she said, 'Is that Trump?' So! I think she meant, 'Is that Donald Trump?' At 68, Mr Trump is almost two decades older than the 50-year-old London Mayor, who joked he was more famous and wealthier than the businessman, thought to be worth $4billion. Mr Johnson is using a six-day, £25,000 jaunt to the US to present himself as an international statesman . There was a sense that Americans are not taking Mr Johnson entirely seiorusly yesterday when his political ambitions were mocked by US presidential frontrunner Hillary Clinton today. Mrs Clinton, the former Secretary of State who is expected to be the Democratic nomination for president in 2018, asked whether US-born Mr Johnson had turned his sights to the White House. She said: 'Is he announcing for president? Which one do you think he'll be, Democrat or Republican?' The jibe comes followed criticism of Mr Johnson's 'promotional tour' of the United States, amid claims he is using it to boost his chances of being the next Conservative leader. The US jaunt is his third long-haul mission in the last three months, having already visited Iraq and Far East. Mr Johnson has faced criticism for his 'promotional tour' of the United States, amid claims he is using it to boost his chances of being the next Conservative leader . Taking questions from Americans on the radio, Mr Johnson was repeatedly asked about his dealings with the Queen, from the names of her Corgis to what they chat about. He joked that America's fascination with the Queen is a mark of a secret desire to be reunited with Britain in a 'commonwealth of English-speaking peoples', reversing the declaration of independence from the British empire made in 1776. Three out of four questions to the mayor from Americans on his LBC radio phone-in related to the Royal Family, with Mr Johnson asked when he last spoke to the Queen, what kind of sandwiches were eaten at Buckingham Palace, and what Her Majesty's pet corgis were called. Mr Johnson said: 'What does this show you? That deep down, in a primal way, they regret the fundamental schism of 1776 and they wish that we were in a single commonwealth of English-speaking peoples again united under Her Majesty. That's what they secretly want.' He added: 'What do they want? Royalty. They have been deprived of it too long, that blissful pride that goes with a hereditary monarchy.' He was grilled about his dealings with the Queen, but was unable to say when he last spoke to the Queen, what kind of sandwiches were eaten at Buckingham Palace, and what Her Majesty's pet corgis were called . However, Mr Johnson proved incapable of answering any of the requests for information about the royals. On the sandwiches served in the Palace, he joked: 'I don't know. Ham from Bucking?' And on the corgis' names, he said: 'I haven't got the faintest idea what they are called. Basil? Eric?' Mr Johnson revealed that he had not spoken to the Queen since shortly after the 2012 Olympics, when she asked about her cameo appearance alongside James Bond actor Daniel Craig, which ended with a lookalike parachuting into the stadium. 'She very innocently wanted to know whether people thought it was funny and I said it was brilliant,' said Mr Johnson. Asked whether he had really not spoken to the Queen since then, he . replied: 'I don't get to see the Queen that often. What do you think I do? Spend my whole time round Buckingham Palace sucking up to the monarchy?'","London Mayor says unkempt mop of blond hair led to mistake identity .

"British holiday makers heading to Europe received a welcome boost last night after the pound soared to a seven-year high against the single currency. Sterling rose above 1.35 euros – a level not seen since January 2008 – giving families more ‘bang for their buck’ on the Continent. Figures from currency exchange firm Travelex show that British families changing £500 will now get 655 euros, compared with 585 euros a year ago. As recently as August they would typically have got just 556 euros – some 99 euros less than today. Soaring sterling: Buoyed by the recovering British economy, the pound has soared to a seven-year high against the euro in a timely boost for holiday makers heading to the continent . The pound has risen 5 per cent against the euro this year and 12.5 per cent in the last 12 months buoyed by the recovery in the British economy. Many experts believe the pound will strengthen even further against the single currency in the coming months – making family holidays cheaper still this summer. One analyst said it could reach 1.55 euros, its highest level since late 2002. David Swann, of Travelex, said: ‘It’s a great time for Brits to be planning their Easter trip or summer holiday as the increase in the pound’s strength will make a considerable difference to their budgets.’ Brian Jamieson, of travel money business Centtrip, said: ‘Sterling’s strength against the euro is great news for UK consumers and businesses alike when they visit the EU.’ The euro has tumbled against a host of currencies from around the world in recent months as the threat of recession and deflation hangs over the single currency bloc. The fall accelerated last month when the European Central Bank outlined plans to pump at least £850billion of emergency funds into the eurozone’s struggling economy. The prospect of a flood of cash being created through so-called quantitative easing has lowered the value of the euro. Tumbling: The euro fallen has against a host of currencies from around the world in recent months as the threat of recession and deflation hangs over the single currency bloc . The situation in Greece, where the new Left-wing government is at loggerheads with the rest of Europe over its debts, has also undermined confidence in the single currency. It is feared that Greece will default on its debts and be forced to leave the euro – plunging the region and the currency back into crisis. Chris Saint, head of currency dealing at Hargreaves Lansdown, said the pound’s rise against the euro ‘has a bit further to run’. He blamed the ‘impasse between Greece and the rest of the eurozone’ and added that ‘there doesn’t seem to be much common ground’. Andrew Sentance, a former Bank of England official and now senior economic adviser at PricewaterhouseCoopers, said the pound is gaining strength as currencies adjust to European quantitative easing as well as ‘poorly performing euro economies and Greek uncertainty’. Harry Adams, of currency specialist Argentex, said he would ‘not be surprised’ if the pound reached 1.55 euro in the coming months – raising concerns for British exporters as the price of goods made in the UK rises for buyers in the eurozone. He said: ‘Europe is once again sending shivers down the spine of financial markets, forcing investors to take caution and sell their euros to more stable currencies such as the dollar and pound. ‘This has pushed the euro to a fresh seven-year low against the pound, dampening Europe’s demand for British goods, causing pain for an estimated 500,000 UK exporters.’","Summer boost sees Britons get more for their money as Sterling soars .

"Xiaomi, one of China's hottest companies, is bringing its blend of cheap yet fashionable technology and crowd-pleasing antics to the U.S. Although its smartphones won't be available here anytime soon, Xiaomi unveiled plans to test the U.S. market by selling inexpensive headphones and other accessories online. It hopes its Internet-driven, customer-friendly model that has helped turn the company into a major player in mobile computing just five years after its founding will work in the US. Xiaomi vice president of global operations Hugo Barra, who the firm poached from Google,  holds up a Mi Note after a presentation in San Francisco, . Xiaomi has emerged as a mobile-computing sensation with a line of smartphones sold in China, India and seven other countries where much of the population still lacks Internet access. The phones offer a smattering of the sleek technology featured in fancier devices made by Apple and Samsung, but they sell at much lower prices, ranging from about $95 to $280. In comparison, an iPhone 6 starts at $650 without subsidies for signing two-year contracts. Xiaomi — pronounced schow-mee — has made a name in China by selling sleek gadgets at relatively low prices, using online sales and social media to keep marketing and distribution costs low. Some analysts have hailed the company as the Chinese equivalent of Apple, in part because of its intensely loyal fans. There are some significant differences between the two companies' approach, though. While Apple tends to keep its future product plans secret, Xiaomi has invited customers to nosh on popcorn at company parties, chat on Xiaomi's online forums and review or make suggestions for new features, which Xiaomi frequently builds into its weekly software updates. 'We don't have customers or users. They prefer to be addressed (as) fans,' said Hugo Barra, who defected from his job overseeing Google's Android products in 2013 to help plot Xiaomi's expansion outside China.

Xiaomi Mi Bands are displayed at a presentation in San Francisco, Thursday, Feb. 12, 2015. Xiaomi vice president of global operations Hugo Barra, left, speaks next to president Bin Lin. While the iPhone still dominates the smaller luxury segment of China's market, Xiaomi's devices are being snapped up by the masses almost as quickly as the company starts accepting online orders. Xiaomi sold about 61 million phones last year, more than tripling its 2013 volume, Bin said. That established Xiaomi as China's top seller of smartphones with a 15 percent market share to edge out Samsung at 14 percent, according to research firm IHS. But another firm, Canalys, estimates that Apple sold more phones in China than either of those companies in the fourth quarter of 2014, when Apple's new iPhone 6 models came out. By concentrating on online sales of phones and accessories, co-founder Bin Lin said, the company has built the third-largest e-commerce site in China. Besides phones, Xiaomi has an electronics lineup that ranges from a 49-inch flat-panel TV for $550 to a fitness band for less than $20. The company also has sold about 2 million stuffed bunnies that serve as Xiaomi's mascot. The Mi Note from Chinese firm Xiaomi has a 5.7-inch display, is 6.95mm thick and weighs 161g. This makes it 0.2-inches larger, 0.15mm thinner and 11 lighter than Apple's iPhone 6 Plus (comparison pictured) But executives acknowledged the company would face big hurdles in the U.S., where most consumers buy smartphones from wireless carriers at subsidized prices. That could make Xiaomi's low-margin business model less effective here. Xiaomi vice president of global operations Hugo Barra points toward the Mi TV 2 . Apple's head of design hit out Xiaomi at the recent Vanity Fair New Estalishment Summit in San Francisco. Asked what he felt about the company being described as the 'Apple of China', Sir Jonathan Ive criticised them for copying his company's designs. 'I don't see it as flattery,' he said, 'I actually see it as theft.' Sir Jonathan  said seeing knockoff designs made him think of the lengthy development cycle that went into producing the originals. In addition, Xiaomi has been accused of copying — or at least closely imitating — some designs from Apple or other companies. At a San Francisco event Thursday, executives stressed an array of software and features that Xiaomi has developed to run on top of the Android system that Google makes available for other device makers. When asked whether a fear of patent lawsuits could deter Xiaomi from selling phones in the United States, Bin said that's not a major issue for his company. Xiaomi raised $1.1 billion late last year in an investment that valued the privately held company at $45 billion. The company's eight founders include CEO Jun Lei, one of China's best-known technology entrepreneurs; Bin, a former engineer at Microsoft and Google; and former Motorola executive Guangping Zhou.","Xiaomi sold 61 million phones last year, more than tripling its 2013 volume .

"Two single mothers who left their young children locked in a cold and squalid flat for 12 hours while they went out drinking walked free from court today. The pair, aged 25 and 26, drank heavily at the older mother’s home in Gloucester before heading out to the pub at about 11pm and going onto a party where they stayed until 11am the next day. The six-year-old girl and boy, seven, had gone by the time they got back to the flat - having been collected by the police after a neighbour called at 5.40am to say the children were home alone. Avoided jail: The pair, aged 25 and 26, drank heavily at the older mother’s home in Gloucester before heading out to the pub at about 11pm and going onto a party where they stayed until 11am the next day . Officers found that the flat was cold, there was very little food in the kitchen and the only bedding was a thin and dirty duvet with no pillow, Gloucester Crown Court was told. The two mothers pleaded guilty to child neglect and were both sentenced to six months in jail suspended for two years, as well as a supervision order, offender programme and overnight curfew. Judge Euan Ambrose told the pair - who cannot be identified for legal reasons - he only spared them jail to avoid their children suffering further. The judge said: ‘Your decision to go out was utterly irresponsible. It amounted to the two of you putting your own selfish pleasures above the welfare of your children.’ Both children were taken into care after the offence but the boy - the son of the older woman - had been returned to her after four weeks. However, the younger woman’s daughter remains in foster care - although her mother has access to her under supervision three times a week. Sentencing: Gloucester Crown Court (pictured) was told that officers found the flat was cold, there was very little food in the kitchen and the only bedding was a thin and dirty duvet with no pillow . Describing the circumstances found by the police when they arrived at the flat, Mr Kesner said they initially knocked on the door but got no reply - although they could hear movement inside. An officer opened the letterbox and saw the children. He asked if anyone else was in the flat. The boy replied: ‘My mum went to the High Street but she wasn’t here when we woke up.’ Mr Kesner said ‘On looking at the children the officer could see they appeared frightened, uncomfortable and cold. The police therefore opened the door and the little girl was crying. ‘She said she didn’t have anything to wear on her bottom half of her body so the police looked in the boy’s bedroom to see if they could find anything suitable for her to put on. ‘In his bedroom they noticed what is described as his bedding being a thin dirty duvet with no pillow. There were hardly any clothes in the chest of drawers, just a single school uniform and two T-shirts. ‘The police looked for food in the fridge and the kitchen but it was almost bare. I think Your Honour has seen the state of the kitchen with hardly any food in it. ‘All the police noticed were empty bottles of wine and spirits. The little girl was asked when she had last eaten. This was a Saturday morning and she said the last she had eaten was breakfast on Friday morning.’ Both women had previous criminal convictions but not for any relevant offences, Mr Kesner said. The girl’s mum had a drug conviction on her record. Lloyd Jenkins, for the girl’s mother, said: ‘There are no excuses. On April 25 she was extremely selfish. She decided to have a night out and ignore the welfare of her daughter. ‘What she did was deplorable. She is ashamed of what she did and regrets her behaviour. She has said “I don’t know what came over me”.’ The woman had a history of depression, anxiety and alcoholism but since November last year had stopped drinking apart from a lapse over Christmas, he said. Her abusive partner was now out of her life having been sentenced to six and a half years imprisonment for grievous bodily harm, he added. Joe Maloney, for the boy’s mother, said the woman realised how stupid she had been and how much the children were at risk. ‘There have been no further difficulties since (her son) was returned to her,’ said Mr Maloney. ‘She is determined to ensure this sort of incident does not take place again.'","Pair aged 25 and 26 drank heavily at older mother's home in Gloucester .

"David Cameron last night urged wobbling European leaders not to go soft on Vladimir Putin in the wake of a ‘ceasefire’ in Ukraine. At an EU summit in Brussels, the Prime Minister insisted Europe must stand firm in maintaining sanctions against Russia. His comments came after the leaders of Russia, Ukraine, France and Germany reached a deal to end the spiralling bloodshed in the region after a tense 17 hours of negotiations. Scroll down for video . Standing firm: Prime Minister David Cameron poses with Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko ahead of an European Union summit in Brussels where he called on fellow leaders not to go soft on Vladimir Putin .

Devastation: A man cooks on an open fire in Debaltseve, on the front line of Ukraine's civil war . Under the agreement in Minsk, a ceasefire will begin on Sunday and heavy weapons will be pulled back from the conflict zones in eastern Ukraine, with a buffer zone created between the frontlines. German Chancellor Angela Merkel said the deal offered a ‘glimmer of hope’. However Mr Cameron adopted a more sceptical tone on last night’s apparent diplomatic breakthrough. 'If this is a genuine ceasefire, then of course that would be welcome,’ he said. ‘But what matters most of all is actually actions on the ground rather than just words on a piece of paper. ‘I think we should be very clear that [Russian President] Putin needs to know that unless his behaviour changes, the sanctions we have in place won’t be altered.’ However former British army chief Lord Dannatt told the Mail the deal was a ‘huge gain’ for Putin. He said there will now be two days of ‘frantic land grabbing’ from the separatists in Ukraine, who have ‘established territory’. UK officials agreed the ‘ceasefire’ should be treated with caution until there was proof that Putin meant to pull back. ‘We need to send a clear signal,’ said one British diplomat.

"Efforts to control mass immigration are being held back by a ‘clearly inadequate’ budget and the institutional bias of the BBC, a report warns today. The Government dedicates just 0.25 per cent – or £1.8billion – of its annual expenditure to securing Britain’s borders and removing illegal immigrants and foreign criminals. Incredibly, this is six times less than the estimated £12billion budget for overseas aid. Migration Watch today claimed a shortage of resources was the main reason the Conservative Party failed in its attempt to cut net migration and to remove non-EU immigrants who moved to Britain, file photograph . In an audit released today, campaign group MigrationWatch said the shortage of resources was a key reason why the Tories have failed to hit their target to cut net migration to the ‘tens of thousands’. While the number of migrants arriving in the UK has increased sharply, the number of non-EU immigrants being removed has stayed flat at around 100,000 every year. In part, this is because border guards do not have the capacity to track down, for example, foreign students, many of whom stay on illegally when their course has finished. The report warns: ‘It is clear the very limited resources devoted to immigration are seriously out of kilter with the very serious consequences for our society of continued mass immigration and the associated level of public concern.’ The think-tank also blamed the pressure put on Westminster by liberals to continue a policy of large-scale immigration. It said there is ‘a strong bias in the BBC in favour of immigration, combined with a reluctance even to address the case for reducing immigration’. It also warns of the ‘pro-immigration bias of parts of the Civil Service’ and ‘continued Treasury enthusiasm for GDP growth, irrespective of the impact of immigration on population growth and on the lower paid’. Migration Watch director Lord Green, pictured, wants David Cameron to introduce specific targets to reduce migration from outside the European Union following the publication of today's report . The study says David Cameron was right to make an election commitment in 2010 to cut net migration to below 100,000. It finds significant progress has been made in reducing the number of non-EU students coming in, largely thanks to the closure of 700 bogus colleges. The Tories have also tightened the rules for family reunion visas and made attempts to crack down on sham marriages. However, the Government’s efforts have been blown off course by a surge in immigration from within the EU – over which ministers have no control. Net migration – the difference between the number of people arriving here and those leaving – is currently at 260,000 a year. MigrationWatch chairman Lord Green of Deddington urged the Tories to stick to the task and wants the party to introduce a specific target for reducing migration from outside the EU. The cross-bench peer said: ‘This is the first time that a government has made a serious effort to get numbers down. ‘They have undeniably made valuable progress but continued strong efforts, led from the top, are essential. These efforts must succeed if the public are not to lose faith in our political system.’ A string of senior BBC figures, including head of radio Helen Boaden, who used to be director of news, have admitted the Corporation held a ‘deep liberal bias’ in its coverage of immigration.","Government spends £1.8 billion a year in security British borders .

"These chilling images taken inside the home of one of America's most prolific child porn collectors reveal his sickening hoard of pacifiers and girl's underwear. The 52-year-old pedophile, who stored one million indecent images of children on discs and hard drives, was arrested in 2013 when police stormed his Orlando apartment. It was there they discovered framed photographs of naked children among piles of garbage and sippy cups. The haul is the largest in Florida's history, with law enforcement describing the contents of the sex offender's home as 'mind-boggling'. Framed photographs of naked children downloaded from the internet were among the sickening indicators of pedophilia found by law enforcement when they swooped on the home of one of America's most prolific child pornography collectors . And despite fearing for his life inside the walls of the Alabama prison where he will spend 20 years, the criminal, a former Navy information systems technician, said 'it would be nice' to be able to access the images again. 'What I did is not worth the hassle … the penalty,' he told USA Today under the promise of anonymity to protect himself from inmates. He claimed to have already been moved from one facility after being threatened by fellow prisoners. Despite possessing one of the largest collections of child pornography on record, the man insists he never acted on his sadistic impulses, confining his pedophilia to his ocean-side home. 'I never touched anybody. There was no direct contact with a victim,' he protested. Prosecutors have not been able to confirm his claim. It started, he said, in 2001, 12 years before being prosecuted, when a single image of a 'very young girl' flashed across his computer screen. 'It piqued my curiosity more than anything,' he remarked, fidgeting in a desk chair. Sippy cups and pacifiers were also discovered at the property in Orlando where the 52-year-old spent 40 uninterrupted days downloading indecent images of children . During a visit to Japan in the 1990s, the man admitted to buying and wearing children's clothes. Girls' underwear and a dress were found by police when they stormed his apartment . Law enforcement described the haul as 'mind boggling' and the largest police had ever seen in Florida's history . From there, his taste graduated from girls between the ages of three and six to those aged eight to 15. Records held by Florida's Department of Law Enforcement reveal the youngest child to appear in his collection was just one. Among the most horrifying of images was one of a two-year-old being sexually abused by an adult female. Another, of a girl around 10, showed her to be tied up with rope. While he claims not to have begun downloading the indecent images until 2001, the former serviceman admitted to 'encounters' with child prostitutes during a 1987 tour of the Philippines. Seven years later in Japan he began wearing children's underwear and buying sippy cups, pacifiers and diapers. Such behavior has 'nothing to do' with the collection of pornography discovered by police some years later, he claimed, adding his only allies in prison were fellow pedophiles. When arrested, the 52-year-old had spent 40 uninterrupted days downloading and looking at child pornography. The end of the binge came when police arrived on his doorstep with a search warrant.","Naval officer is one of America's most prolific child pornography collectors .

"Tony Abbott has admitted he doesn't feel any guilt about the treatment of children in detention centres as heartbreaking drawings were released showing the effect it has on their mental stability. The drawings by young children held inside Australia's detention centres were released as part of a damning report from the Australian Human Rights Commission that found hundreds of children threatened to or committed self harm in immigration detention. When the Prime Minister was asked on radio on Thursday about the report and whether he felt 'any guilt' over the treatment of children in detention, he replied: 'None whatsoever'. 'The most compassionate thing you can do is stop the boats. We have stopped the boats,' Mr Abbott told 3AW's Neil Mitchell. Scroll down for video . Drawings of crying faces by young children held inside Australia's detention centres were released as part of a damning report from the Australian Human Rights Commission . Tony Abbott has admitted he doesn't feel any guilt about the treatment of children in detention centres as heartbreaking drawings were released showing the effect it has on their mental stability . The report, titled The Forgotten Children, was tabled in parliament on Wednesday night. Drawings by children in detention accompanied the report and depicted crying faces, rows of tents and children watching from behind bars as Australians enjoy the freedom outside a detention centre. The long-awaited report called for a royal commission into the treatment of children in immigration detention after concluding that prolonged detainment caused significant mental and physical harm. Hundreds of assaults against children were reported and 128 teenagers harmed themselves between January 2013 and March 2014. Mr Abbott's remarks on radio on Thursday came after he was told there were 10-year-olds on suicide watch and three-year-olds with depression. 'There were almost 2,000 children in detention in the middle of 2013 under the former government’s watch, there were almost 1,400 children in detention at the time of the election. That number is now under 200. Why? Because this government has stopped the boats,' Mr Abbott responded. 'Now I have a very simple question: Where was the Human Rights Commission during the life of the former government when hundreds of people were drowning at sea? 'This is a blatantly partisan politicised exercise and the Human Rights Commission ought to be ashamed of itself.'

This picture of a boy crying as he waits was drawn by a primary school aged child at Christmas Island in 2014 . The long-awaited report called for a royal commission into the treatment of children in immigration detention after concluding that prolonged detainment caused significant mental and physical harm . The report made 16 recommendations after the most comprehensive 10-month inquiry in a decade into the policy of detaining  children who arrive in Australia by boat to seek asylum. The commission found that Australia's practice of holding children in detention violated human rights law and recommended that they should be released as soon as possible into the community. Neil Mitchell: Do you feel any guilt at all about the way children have been dealt with in detention? Tony Abbott: None whatsoever, Neil. Neil Mitchell: But there are 10-year-olds on suicide watch? Tony Abbott: Neil, the most compassionate thing you can do is stop the boats. We have stopped the boats… . Neil Mitchell: Three-year-olds with depression? Tony Abbott: Neill, there were almost 2,000 children in detention in the middle of 2013 under the former government’s watch, there were almost 1,400 children in detention at the time of the election. That number is now under 200. Neil Mitchell: Do you want those 200 kids out of detention? Tony Abbott: Of course, of course, but the best way to ensure, the only way to ensure that we have no children in immigration detention is not to have any boats. It called on the federal government to ban indefinite detention, close the 'harsh and cramped' Christmas Island immigration centre, get children off Nauru and appoint an independent guardian for unaccompanied minors. The report stated that 'there appears to be no rational explanation for the prolonged detention of children.' Commission President Gillian Triggs said that the Australian government's amendments to the Migration Act, which redefined the term 'refugee', was of 'profound concern'. 'It is imperative that Australian governments never again use the lives of children to achieve political or strategic advantage,' she said. 'The aims of stopping people smugglers and deaths at sea do not justify the cruel and illegal means adopted,' she told SBS. 'Australia is better than this.' However, Attorney-General George Brandis told parliament that the recommendations had been a long-standing point of difference between the government and the commission. 'The government does not accept the commission's findings,' he said. Mr Brandis said that the federal government had made 'significant progress' towards changing the conditions of detention centres since the commission's inquiry had started. 'In short, children in detention is a problem created exclusively by the former Labor Government, which has largely been solved by the current Abbott Government,' he told SBS. Hundreds of assaults against children were reported and 128 teenagers harmed themselves between January 2013 and March 2014 . This drawing by a 16-year-old boy on Christmas Island last year depicts someone asking for 'help!' This picture drawn by a six-year-old detained at the Christmas Island Detention Centre with the words 'I want go out' GetUp Campaigns Chief Erin McCallum said that the findings of the report were concerning. 'Whatever your political persuasion, locking up innocent kids in hideous detention camps is barbaric and it has to stop,' she said. Greens immigration spokeswoman Sarah Hanson-Young said the report must be the turning point to end the cruel practice of locking children in detention camps. 'This vile, institutionalised child abuse has to end,' she said in a statement. 'No longer can we turn a blind eye to the sexual, physical and psychological abuse that these policies of indefinite detention are inflicting on children.' Immigration Minister Peter Dutton - who only took on the job in late December - said many of the recommendations reflected existing government policies and were superfluous.

Numbers of children in immigration detention peaked at nearly 2000 in mid-2013 under Labor but now there are only 162 children still detained. Activist group ChilOut said children must only be detained as a measure of last resort and only for the shortest appropriate period. 'This report highlights our dramatic failure to uphold our obligations, by detaining children arbitrarily as punishment for seeking asylum,' it said in a statement. Opposition immigration spokesman Richard Marles said Labor would work through the report findings and recommendations and respond appropriately. 'The best thing we can do for children in detention is to have refugee claims processed quickly so nobody has to languish in detention with no hope of settlement,' he said in a statement.

"Allegations of child sex abuse by a Westminster paedophile ring represent only the ‘tip of the iceberg’, Home Secretary Theresa May revealed yesterday. A group of former MPs and VIPs are alleged to have sexually abused children and killed three boys in the Seventies and Eighties. But yesterday Mrs May suggested even worse claims would follow as she said it was crucial for society to ‘get the truth’. Scroll down for video . Theresa May (pictured) suggested worse claims would follow and it is crucial for society to ‘get the truth' Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe insisted Scotland Yard was taking the claims seriously and promised there would be no cover-up. Last night, Labour MP John Mann said: ‘It would now be extraordinary if there are not arrests soon of prominent people.’ Mrs May said she was determined to ensure that the issues were fully investigated, telling the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show: ‘How was it that in the past, but continuing today, the very institutions of the state that should be protecting children were not doing so? ‘Why was it that these abuses were able to take place and that nobody was brought to justice as a result of that? ‘We must as a society, I believe, get to the truth of that and because I think what we’re seeing is... only the tip of the iceberg on this issue.’ Sir Bernard said dozens of detectives were investigating the historic Westminster child abuse allegations, adding: ‘We have 40 detectives looking into these relatively new claims. Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe (pictured right) also went on the Andrew Marr show and insisted Scotland Yard was taking the claims seriously and promised there would be no cover-up . 'There are a series of claims over a relatively long period of time and not all of them are linked – although in the public’s imagination they may be. ‘We have now had more recently this discussion or these claims about murder and, of course, that makes it even more serious.’ Among the latest allegations are that police may have helped cover up the murder of an eight-year-old boy. It is claimed he was one of three killed by the network alleged to include former MPs and cabinet ministers. Detectives are searching through files on at least 200 missing children to try to identify the alleged victims. A man who claims to have been sexually abused by the group has told police he saw a then-serving Conservative MP murder a boy during a sexual assault in London in around 1980. He said he witnessed the murder of another boy in front of a former Conservative cabinet minister around one or two years later. He also alleged that a third boy had been killed. Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper (pictured left) agreed the claims are likely to be the tip of the iceberg while Labour MP John Mann (right) said it would be 'extraordinary' if there are not arrests of prominent people . The Government is still seeking a chairman for its wide-ranging inquiry into the handling of paedophile activity by members of the Establishment after two candidates quit over their links to senior figures from the period. Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper said yesterday: ‘The latest revelations on historical child abuse are alarming. ‘And the Home Secretary is right that this is likely to be the tip of the iceberg. ‘It is important the inquiry gets under way and that action is taken swiftly to make the system better now so we can protect our children and take what they say about anyone seriously.’ She spoke as it emerged that Labour figures were passed warnings about the Elm Guest House, which was allegedly used by the paedophiles. A union official wrote to David Blunkett and John Prescott, the then home secretary and deputy prime minister, to warn that it was being used as a brothel. Mr Blunkett, who replied personally in November 2002 and alerted Home Office staff, yesterday said the tip-off did not include claims of child sex abuse.","Former MPs alleged to have sexually abused children and killed three boys .

"A 15-year-old boy was shot in the back by a Los Angeles police officer who spotted him in an alley standing next to someone holding what turned out to be a replica gun, authorities have said. Jamar Nicholson was taken to a hospital and released to his mother after treatment the same day. An LAPD captain has apologized to his mother, but the teenager said he wanted to hear the same from the officer. Jamar Nicholson, 15, pictured with his mother Geraldine, shows the bullet wound on his back where he was mistakenly shot by an LAPD officer after standing next to someone who was holding a replica gun . ‘I don't want to see him again,’ Jamar told the Los Angeles Times. ‘But I do want that ‘sorry’.’ Sgt. Frank Preciado said: ‘What the officer thought was a weapon turned out to be a replica handgun.’ The LAPD is investigating Tuesday’s incident that involved two officers from a gang homicide unit. Police say the two officers were driving in the 7200 block of 10th avenue on Tuesday morning when they spotted a teenager pointing what they thought was a gun at another person Tuesday morning. Officers ordered the boy to drop the weapon, Preciado said. When he didn't comply, one of the officers opened fire. The teenager holding the replica weapon wasn't hurt, but Jamar, who standing next to him, was struck in the upper back. Everyone present was detained but no arrests were made, the LA Times reported. The officers concluded that they all were friends. The replica gun, which resembles a real firearm except for the orange tip, involved in the shooting was put on display by police yesterday to highlight the dangers of such toys . But Jamar disputed the officer's account. He said ‘I promise I never heard anything’ like a command to drop the gun and added the officer fired just after shouting ‘Freeze!’ He showed the Times a bandage on his upper back where the bullet hit him. Police put the replica gun on display on Thursday as they pointed out the dangers of such toys. It resembles a real pistol except for a tiny orange piece on the tip. The replica firearm was booked as evidence and a department spokesman told the LA Times that the person holding the fake gun could potentially face charges of brandishing a replica weapon in the presence of a police officer. This is still being discussed with prosecutors. At least one of the officers involved has been removed from the field pending review and placed on desk duty, Yahoo News reports. The officer has also been ordered to undergo a psychological assessment, as is standard in officer-involved shootings. The incident is being investigated by the Force Investigation Division. It is also being reviewed by the police chief, the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office, and the Police Commission. LAPD Commander Andrew Smith said: ‘It's certainly an unfortunate situation. ‘But because of people bringing replica weapons out like that, it certainly could have been a terrible tragedy.’ Alley: Two officer were driving here in the 7200 block of 10th avenue of south LA when they saw the group of teens in the alley, one of the officers opened fire after spotting a teen standing next to a person with a gun .","A Los Angeles Police Department officer shot Jamar Nicholson in the back after spotting him standing next to a person holding a fake gun .

"A  keeper has been mauled to death after entering the lion enclosure at a South Korean zoo to install equipment. The man, believed to be in his fifties, was found bleeding from his neck and legs at Children's Grand Park Zoo in Seoul after being attacked by a male lion. He was pronounced dead at hospital hours later, as it was revealed the zoo had been closed since last week amid fears of an outbreak of bird flu.

Officials this morning confirmed the man, who has been identified only by his second name, Kim, had been trying to install equipment in the enclosure when he was attacked. 'He was critically injured when rescuers arrived,' a source at Gwangjin Fire Station said. 'He had wounds all over his body.' Later, the zoo issued a brief statement confirming the incident. 'The lion has been isolated but I'm not sure what will happen to it,' another keeper, who did not want to be named, said.

Style your hair and put on your favourite lipstick because you'll be spending a lot of time in front of a mirror (picture posed by model) Your goal is to find fabulous things that make you look and feel great. Everything you purchase should showcase you at your very best. So when you hit the shops, dress smartly (in clothes you can speedily whip on and off to minimise time in the changing room), style your hair and put on your favourite lipstick, because you’re going to be spending a lot of time in front of a mirror. Check your wardrobe first to ensure you are focused on what you want and need. Even if you think you’ve got nothing to wear, your current collection holds the secret of past shopping triumphs. Pick out your favourites — the dress that gets compliments, the skinny jeans that prompt friends to ask if you’ve lost weight — then work out why they work so well. Is it the neckline? The cut? The colour? These are the cues against which you can compare all potential new items. Next, pull out anything you rarely (or never) wear. Try it on and be honest as to why it doesn’t get worn. Perhaps the colour isn’t quite right, it doesn’t go with anything you own, you don’t have the right occasion, it makes you look chubby/busty/flat-chested/big-bottomed, or you are convinced it will be perfect when you lose half a stone. Let this be your lesson not to buy anything that doesn’t fit your body perfectly right now. Buying in anticipation of future weight loss rarely works. BARGAINS WILL BE ON THE LEFT . Studies show people gravitate towards the right-hand side of a shop first, so be aware of what's on your left (picture posed by model) Don’t be duped! Be on your guard for tempting displays as you enter a store. Most people are right-handed, and studies show people tend to gravitate to the right-hand side of the shop first, which is where the newest (and the most expensive) merchandise will be placed. Carpeted areas can be danger zones, too; stores use carpeting to slow you down in the sections where they want you to spend the most time (and money). And don’t be seduced by ‘anchoring’, a sales practice in which two similar items with very different price tags are placed next to each other so that the more expensive item makes you think the cheaper one is a bargain. Scan the shop for colour first, then go in for a closer look at style, size, fabric and price. It’s easy to get overwhelmed by long racks of clothing. Colour is the easiest starting point. STICK TO COLOURS THAT FLATTER YOU . Remember to choose colours that suit your skin tone and make you look your best (picture posed by model) The right colour for you is a shade that makes your skin look more radiant — avoid anything that makes you think it might work with different or better make-up. Stick with the colours that flatter you and keep your personal colour palette in the forefront of your mind. Avoid neutrals: the woman in merlot, turquoise or cerise is the one you’ll remember, so if an item is available in both a neutral and a colour, go for colour — your colour — and make an impression. Store lighting can distort colour, so ask the sales assistant if you can take an item to a window, and only make a decision to buy if it looks great in natural light. STRETCH OUT IN THE FITTING ROOM . If you like it, sit down in it. Something may look great when you’re standing up straight, but you’re likely to be spending a lot of time sitting, so always check how it feels when you’re seated. When trying on a buttoned shirt, stretch your arms back so that your chest sticks out. If there’s any sign of gape, don’t buy it. When trying on trousers, do these fitting-room gymnastics: bend at the knees and at the waist, then sit and squat. If you can’t do any of this comfortably, you’re in the wrong pair. BUY BIG TO LOOK SLIMMER . Don't be afraid to go up a size if the outfit is more flattering that way, no one will check what the label says! (picture posed by model) Go up a size to appear slimmer and don’t fret about what the label says. No one will check when you’re wearing the item and looking amazing. The important issues are: does it flatter? And, is it good quality? When buying a bra, try it on using the loosest, not the middle, hook. Bras stretch out over time so if it fits at the loosest setting, you can tighten it over time to maintain the right fit. Only shop for shoes in the afternoon. Feet swell during the day, so buying when your feet are at their largest makes you less likely to end up with shoes that pinch. CHOOSE CLASSIC DESIGNS . When budgeting for a seasonal wardrobe, aim to spend 75 per cent on classic items and 25 per cent on trends. By sticking to mostly classics, you will get much more use out of any high‑fashion items. If you come across something you absolutely love that’s eye-wateringly expensive, only consider it if it’s something you can wear for years to come. Save your money by buying trendy pieces at lower-priced stores to ensure you feel no remorse next season when fashion moves forward. WALK AWAY IF YOU'RE NOT SURE . The best way to avoid an impulse buy is to take the time to really think about a purchase if you're not totally sure, take 24-hours to consider your choice (picture posed by model) You may love a design you saw on a red carpet or in a magazine, but unless you love it on you, don’t buy it. Be true to yourself. Trust your instinct — if you find yourself questioning the purchase, it’s for a reason. The litmus test for something daring is to pick a fictional character it would work on (Marge Simpson? The Good Wife?). If that reflects you, buy it; if not, pass and move on. The best way to avoid an impulse buy is not to buy. If you’re unsure, walk away and give yourself a 24-hour cooling-off period. Ask the shop assistant to put it on hold, and if you then can’t stop thinking about that item, run back the following day and get it. But if you remain undecided, you’re better off without it. Before you hand over your credit card, check the store’s returns policy. You may only have seven days, or the store may have an ‘exchange only’ policy which could affect your decision. If you’ve got the item home but you’re still not sure, hold on to the receipt. Then set an alarm on your phone for one day prior to the last return date — if you still haven’t worn it, take it back for a refund. Never worry about coming home empty-handed from a shopping trip. A day spent fruitlessly shopping can be frustrating, but accept there are good shopping days and bad shopping days and that your success rate will vary. SHOP ONLINE ON TUESDAYS . Stores will put new items on sale on Tuesdays and will also put some items into the sale section, bear this in mind when browsing the web for clothes (picture posed by model) Do your online shopping on Tuesdays, as this is the day stores put up sale and new items. Colours can be tricky to assess online, so try to view two different items in the same fabric to discern the true shade. When unsure about a fabric, use the zoom feature to reveal texture and possible sheen. Don’t buy a garment you haven’t seen on a model. A flat picture only gives half the story; you need to see how it hangs on the body to make a considered decision. Place all items you are considering in your online shopping cart. You may find within 48 hours you will receive a discount promotional code from the retailer to sway you to complete the purchase. But don’t let this persuade you unless you really want the item. Finally, ensure the web address of the payment page begins with ‘https’, not just ‘http’. This ensures it is safe.

"Charlie Sheen has penned a bizarre ode to his 'hero' Brian Williams, offering him his support - and a place to stay. The beleaguered newscaster has been suspended from NBC for six months without pay after falsely claiming that he was in a helicopter that was shot at during the Iraq War in 2003. In a lengthy poem shared to Twitter on Wednesday night, Sheen, who was booted off CBS' Two and a Half Men for his own controversial behavior in 2011, thanked Williams for his '24 years of inimitable professionalism'. 'Dear Mr. Williams,' he wrote. 'Sorry to bother you during this most surreal, unjust and mercurial moment in your awesome life. Support: Charlie Sheen, left, has thrown his support behind suspended NBC newscaster Brian Williams, right, and thanked him for his '24 years of inimitable professionalism' in a poem posted online . 'First off, THANK YOU, for 24 years of inimitable professionalism and top shelf brilliance, as a stone cold passion driven and (PERFECTLY) fact based journalist.' He also thanked him for his 'NOBLE sacrifices that made our longest nights shorter'. 'You good sir, are a hero in my Entire Library,' he wrote . In the poem, Sheen added that Williams was 'clearly the victim of a transparent and vile witch hunt' carried out by 'cowards' who were intent on trashing 'the genius they relied on for almost 3 decades!' He concluded by offering Williams refuge - 'if you need it!' - before signing off 'the MaSheen'. It is unknown if Williams has taken up Sheen on his offer. Williams, 55, was removed from the Nightly News after soldiers accused him of falsely claiming in a news report two weeks ago that he had been aboard a Chinook that was forced to land in Iraq. In fact, he had been on another aircraft more than half an hour behind the one that was forced to land. It emerged that his story about the incident had changed over the past decade. Ode: Sheen wrote this lengthy poem in support of Williams before sharing it to Twitter on Wednesday night . Shake up: Lester Holt has now stepped into Williams' role on NBC's Nightly News. On Wednesday, Holt, pictured, explained that Williams would be taking some time off from his NBC duties . Lester Holt, who has stepped into Williams' role on the Nightly News, directly addressed the controversy in Wednesday night's broadcast. 'We will work every night to be worthy of your trust,' he assured the audience. In a statement, NBC's chief executive Stephen Burke wrote: 'By his actions, Brian has jeopardized the trust millions of Americans place in NBC News. 'His actions are inexcusable and this suspension is severe and appropriate. 'I know Brian loves his country, NBC News, and his colleagues. He deserves a second chance and we are rooting for him. Brian has shared his deep remorse with me and he is committed to winning back everyone’s trust.' His removal for the next six months means he has effectively been fined $5 million. He has not commented publicly about the punishment.

"MP John Mann claimed that two whistleblowers who threatened to expose an alleged VIP paedophile ring may have been murdered . A campaigning MP sensationally claimed yesterday that two whistleblowers who threatened to expose an alleged VIP paedophile ring may have been murdered. John Mann has passed detectives information about the suspicious deaths of the men who were allegedly poised to lift the lid on child sex abuse at the heart of the Establishment. The development comes as the Labour MP told the Daily Mail yesterday that a key witness has come forward providing the address of a Dolphin Square flat which was used for ‘abuse parties’ by a network of high-profile figures including politicians and leading members of the judiciary, military and security services. The potential breakthrough, which could help detectives identify the alleged perpetrators, comes a day after it emerged that Mr Mann had handed detectives a dossier naming 22 politicians – including six serving MPs and members of the House of Lords – suspected of involvement in a Westminster paedophile ring. The Bassetlaw MP has since spoken to a victim who has provided a specific location where it is claimed that boys from care homes in Lambeth, South London, were taken to be abused – the apartment in the luxury block of 1,250 flats at Dolphin Square in Pimlico. Mr Mann alerted police to allegations of child abuse at the prestigious block in 1989 when he was a Lambeth councillor, but nothing was done. The two whistleblowers he claims may have been killed are said to have been ready to expose powerful figures preying on teenage boys from children’s care homes in Lambeth. The information Mr Mann has given police concerns the suspicious deaths of a Lambeth Council caretaker in 1989 and a social worker in 1993 who allegedly threatened to expose a paedophile ring linked to a future minister in Tony Blair’s government. The unnamed caretaker was said to have tapes on ultra-violent ‘sex parties’ when he died in an apparent arson attack. A second council employee, social services manager Bulic Forsythe, was found dead by firefighters in his blazing flat in Clapham. His skull had been fractured by a heavy weapon. In the months before his murder the 42-year-old had told colleagues at Lambeth Council he was on the verge of exposing child sex abuse and corruption. Witnesses have said Mr Forsythe had information about council buildings being used to film child sexual abuse. He died at the time of an internal council probe into alleged sexual abuse in the housing department where he had worked. The Bassetlaw MP has since spoken to a victim who said children were abused in an apartment in the luxury block of 1,250 flats at Dolphin Square in Pimlico . The report is said to implicate council officers as well as police and politicians. It states: ‘The murder of Bulic Forsythe was seen by some witnesses as a possible outcome for anyone who strayed too far in their investigation or who asked too many questions.’ Though the panel found no ‘direct link’ between his death and work, it said its evidence should be handed to police. The murder was investigated but never solved and cold case detectives are re-examining it. Police are said to be investigating five potential paedophile rings operating over the last three decades in locations including Dolphin Square, Lambeth, North Wales and Rochdale. The Dolphin Square flat which Mr Mann claims he can identify is not thought to have been the residence of any politician. Mr Mann told the Mail: ‘It is a short-term let. It is a big apartment in a particular part of Dolphin Square. The allegation is teenage boys were taken there and abused by at least two MPs. It is a specific allegation which will need to be verified.’ The estate is a few hundred yards along the Thames from Parliament and apartments could be rented by the night. Police believe the block was the home of sordid ‘abuse parties’ between 1975 and 1984.","MP says two VIP child abuse whistleblowers may have been 'murdered'

"A former ISIS member, believed to be an Australian national, has revealed how he escaped the terror group after witnessing the horrific executions of Westerners in Syria. The man, who identified himself as Abu Ibrahim, converted to Islam and spent six months fighting as part of Islamic State in Syria, relishing his life under Sharia Law. Despite approving of the executions of locals for crimes such as adultery, Ibrahim said that the killing of Westerners concerned him, prompting him to leave the death cult. Scroll down for video . A man identifying himself as Abu Ibrahim claims he left ISIS after witnessing Westerners being executed . 'Some of the policies, like I said, with the beheadings of non-combatants. Some of those things I don’t agree with,' Ibrahim said. The man, believed to be in his 30s, was interviewed by a CBS journalist under the condition that his voice be changed and his face be hidden from view. Despite the distortion of his voice, Ibrahim's Australian accent is clear, an indication of why the barbaric executions of Westerners may have shocked him. While he said that the enforcement of Sharia law was something that many Muslims 'look forward to', 'seeing someone die is not something anyone probably would want to see'. Ibrahim said that he had witnessed at least one crucifixion and stoning for a local couple accused of adultery, but wasn't troubled by the barbaric punishment. He explained the conditions of living under Sharia law and what life is really like for the members of Islamic State. He said that it was the role of the religious police, the Hisbah, to enforce Islamic code. Despite approving of the executions of locals for crimes such as adultery, Ibrahim said that the killing of Westerners concerned him, prompting him to leave the death cult . Ibrahim is believed to be in his 30s and appears to have an Australian accent . Behaviour such as women not covering their heads, men shaving, and music playing are all cause for punishment under Sharia law. 'A lot of people when they come they have a lot of enthusiasm about what they’ve seen online, what they’ve seen on YouTube. They see it as something a lot grander than what the reality is - it’s not all military parades or victories,' he told CBS. Up to 20,000 members of Islamic State are believed to be foreigners, with up to 3,400 of these from Western nations- including an approximated 100 from Australia. The men are provided with food, housing, and a $50 stipend to support themselves while they offer their service to ISIS, reported The Daily Telegraph. The money is doubled during winter in order that the men are able to buy proper winter clothes. Ibrahim said he was prompted to leave after witnessing the executions of Westerners by ISIS. James Foley (above) is one of many Western hostages killed by the terrorist group . While Ibrahim said that he wanted to live under Sharia law, he was bothered by the killing of Westerners, such as aid worker Kayla Mueller (above) Up to 20,000 members of Islamic State are believed to be foreigners, with up to 3,400 of these from Western nations- including an approximated 100 from Australia . Married couples are supplied with furniture and and housing, while a heater is provided to the other men. Ibrahim said that he would like to return home, but was afraid of the consequences if he was to arrive back in the country. He feared being imprisoned by ISIS when he attempted to leave, afraid of being questioned and detained by the 'brotherhood' that he had chosen to join. Ibrahim said that ISIS executed members they believed to be spies, and were extremely concerned about infiltration. In the end, he decided that he was no longer fulfilling to reasons he had travelled to Syria in the first place- to aid humanitarian efforts- and, missing his family, made the risky exit from the terror organisation. Ibrahim said that he had witnessed at least one crucifixion and stoning for a local couple accused of adultery . Ibrahim said that it was the role of the religious police, the Hisbah, to enforce Islamic code . Up to 20,000 members of Islamic State who have travelled to Syria are believed to be foreigners . He said that many of the men within ISIS were becoming disillusioned and scared, while the morale of others was growing even stronger. Professor Greg Barton, from Monash University's Global Terrorism Research Centre, said terror recruiters lured targets by making friends through social media, like many sexual predators. Around a quarter of those who have fled to the Middle East to fight with Islamic State have been killed, as new warnings say that key battlegrounds such as the town of Kobane on the Turkish-Syrian border are fast becoming 'graveyards' for naive foreign fighters. Intelligence has also been leaked that Australian women are travelling to Syria to be brides for members of Islamic State, with many being sold as sex slaves. Up to 3,400 ISIS members are from Western nations- including an approximated 100 from Australia .

"This horrifying clip shows a child unflinchingly receive 60 lashes to his back for simply referring to Islamic State by a term they hate: 'Daesh'. As dozens gather around the town square to watch with emotionless expressions, the boy kneels on the ground - purportedly in Anbar, Iraq - as he accepts his penalty. His punisher relentlessly whips the boy in the short clip, who appears to be crying and pleading for mercy. Scroll down for video . Barbaric: The 23-second clip shows a young boy being lashed for using the term 'Daesh' in reference to ISIS . The child's crime was to refer to the terror group as 'Daesh' - a loose acronym for the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (al-Dawla Al-Islamiya al-Iraq al-Sham). The term is used by enemies of ISIS and has negative undertones, as it sounds similar to Arabic words which mean 'one who crushes something underfoot' and 'one who sows discord'. The video of the barbaric punishment was posted to Facebook on Tuesday and has been viewed thousands of times. Cruel: The video, purportedly in Iraq, shows a large crowd in the town square watch as the boy is punished . ISIS have released a series of shocking pictures and videos in recent months showing the brutal punishments handed out to those who break the rules. Behaviour such as women not covering their heads, men shaving, and music playing are all cause for punishment under strict Sharia law. And those who commit more serious crimes have been executed in public. So-called adulterous women have been stoned to death, men who have allegedly engaged in homosexual acts have been thrown from the tops of buildings and bandits have been crucified in the streets. Earlier this week, Islamic State militants in Syria publicly beheaded a man for allegedly practicing witchcraft. The unknown man was photographed being killed by a masked executioner in a village just outside ISIS' stronghold and de facto capital Raqqa while a large crowd looked on. Precise details of the victim's so-called crime are not known, but he was charged with witchcraft and 'invoking magic'. Over the past two months, ISIS has also executed 120 of its own members, most of them foreign fighters trying to return home, according to the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.

"The huge reaction on social media and in the news following Jon Stewart's announcement that he is leaving The Daily Show after 16 years inspired the comedian's opening monologue during Wednesday night's show. 'Did I die?' joked the popular host of Comedy Central's The Daily Show who has won 19 Emmys and a Grammy. 'Last night I was perusing the internet, and I guess my question to you is, 'Did I die?' Cause it all seems very… 'I died.' Very weird,' Stewart said during Wednesday's episode. Scroll down for video . 'Did I die?' joked Jon Stewart during his opening monologue on Wednesday night's show in reaction to coverage of his decision to quit after 16 years . 'It's an overwhelming day here, as you can imagine, and people have been asking, I'm not exactly sure what I'm going to do next.' Stewart's surprise announcement prompted wall-to-wall media coverage in the 24 hours after his announcement with much written about his important role poking fun at politicians and also speculation about his replacement. His longtime foe Arby's also got in on the action and jokingly tweeted him with the offer of a job. 'Jon, feel free to reach out to us at careers@arbys.com,' read the cheeky tweet. 'You know what? Working there might be fun,' Stewart said. 'I guess my only question as a future employee would be, to work there, would I have to handle, serve, touch, eat or even look at what you so generously describe as food?' Comedy Central has a 'short list' of replacements for Stewart when he steps down later this year, company executive Doug Herzog said on Wednesday. The channel and Stewart are consulting on when he'll depart the job he's held for more than 16 years and discussing whether he'll have a continued role with the show, said Herzog, president of Viacom Entertainment Group. 'TBD,' he replied, using the shorthand for 'to be determined,' then added: 'It's not out of the question.' Stewart is an executive producer on the show as well as host. Stewart's company, Busboy Productions, produces The Nightly Show with Larry Wilmore, which replaced The Colbert Report. Herzog said 'there's a short list' but wouldn't discuss any specific people being considered as host. It's uncertain whether the list includes former Daily Show correspondent John Oliver, who moved over to HBO after successfully filling in for Stewart when he took a movie-making break. Asked about whether Oliver is a candidate, Herzog's reply was succinct. Stewart's longtime foe Arby's got in on the action on Wednesday and jokingly tweeted him with the offer of a job . Stewart couldn't resist a dig at the fast food chain and gave his customary criticism of their menu offerings . 'John Oliver's got a job,' he said. Asked if that meant he was not under consideration, Herzog said: 'I think he's spoken for.' Whoever is chosen has heavy lifting to do. 'It's not easy. The shadow of Jon Stewart is going to loom large. ... What you have to get comfortable with is, it's just not going to be Jon Stewart. And it's going to be different,' Herzog said. Whatever happens, he said, The Daily Show is 'a format that's built to last, and last it will.' Herzog declined to comment on when Stewart, whose contract is up this fall, told Comedy Central of his decision to leave. The comedians departure was announced by Comedy Central President Michele Ganeless after Stewart, host of the show since 1999, broke the news to the studio audience at Tuesday's taping in New York. Comedy Central has a 'short list' of replacements for Stewart when he steps down later this year, but company executive Doug Herzog refused to confirm if former John Oliver is in the running . Stewart, slapping his desk and blinking back tears, told the audience that he had signed on to The Daily Show 17 years ago, and '17 years is the longest I have ever in my life held a job, by 16 years and five months.' 'This show doesn't deserve an even slightly restless host, and neither do you,' he said. It's yet to be decided when he'll leave or what comes next for him, Stewart said, with one exception. 'I'm gonna have dinner, on a school night, with my family,' he said. Ganeless called Stewart, 52, a 'comic genius.' She did not specify his exit date or what led to his decision. 'Through his unique voice and vision, The Daily Show has become a cultural touchstone for millions of fans and an unparalleled platform for political comedy that will endure for years to come,' Ganeless said in a statement. Stewart's influence is seen in the work of Stephen Colbert, John Oliver and Larry Wilmore, who went on to earn shows of their own. Other Daily Show alumni include Steve Carell, Ed Helms, Josh Gad and new Saturday Night Live Weekend Update anchor Michael Che.","Stewart announced on Tuesday night that he is stepping down from The Daily news after 16 years as host .

"A former Grand Slam tennis champion  has denied sexually abusing three girls he coaches decades ago, a court heard. Bob Hewitt, 75, claimed that the mother of one of his alleged victims supported him as he gave evidence at his trial in Johannesburg, South Africa. Hewitt, one of the world's best doubles plays in the 1960s and 1970s, testified for the first time today. He said the mother of one of his accusers 'has supported me that I did not do anything to her daughter.' Former grand slam tennis doubles champion Bob Hewitt outside a Johannesburg court Monday, Feb. 9, 2015. Hewitt, who is on trial for rape and sexual assault of minors in the country, has pleaded not guilty . Hewitt, who was a member of the U.S.-based International Tennis Hall of Fame before the allegations of abuse emerged, is on trial charged with two counts of rape and one of sexual assault of girls he coached in cases dating back more than 30 years. The alleged offenses all took place in South Africa, where he now lives. Two women testified  that Hewitt raped them in the early 1980s when they were both under 16. A third accused him of sexually assaulting her during a tennis lesson in the early 1990s, when she was between 14 and 17 years. Australian-born Hewitt, who  accompanied at court by his wife, won nine Grand Slam doubles and six mixed doubles titles in the 1960s and 1970s. He also reached the semifinals of the men's singles at the Australian Open three times and won the Davis Cup with South Africa in 1974 after settling there. He teamed up occasionally with greats Billie Jean King and Arthur Ashe. He was indefinitely suspended from the Rhode Island-based Hall of Fame in 2012 after the organisation conducted an investigation into the allegations.

"A bereft mother says she is outraged that a bungling doctor who sent her sick toddler home from hospital three days before he died of dehydration and kidney failure is allowed to carry on working. Harry Connolly, 19 months, was admitted to hospital in April 2011 with sickness, diarrhoea and lethargy. But, despite his mother Lucy's concerns about her son's condition, paediatrician Dr Tasnim Arif told Mrs Connolly, 32, she should take her son home. Three days later, his devastated father Ray, 47, found the youngster lifeless in his cot. Furious: Ray Connolly, 47, and his wife Lucy, 32, from Northampton, are outraged that the doctor who sent home their sick toddler from hospital three days before he died  has been allowed to carry on working . Tragic: Harry Connolly, 19 months, was found dead in his cot by his father three days after being sent home from Northampton General Hospital. He died of dehydration and kidney failure, caused by an inflamed colon . Yesterday, a tribunal brought by the General Medical Council found Dr Arif guilty of a series of failings, including failing to carry out vital checks before discharging Harry. But, despite objections from the GMC, the tribunal ruled that Dr Arif was still fit to practise, after clearing her of other charges. They also refused a plea from the GMC to put a warning on Dr Arif's file. Mrs Connolly, from Delapre, Northampton, today branded Dr Arif a 'danger to other patients' and accused the Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service of 'failing to protect the public'. She told MailOnline: 'I believe Harry would still be alive if the doctor had listened to me. I feel it is nothing short of criminal. The worst part is that these errors, which the hearing found had taken place, killed my son.' At an inquest that heard evidence from several practitioners involved in Harry's care, Coroner Anne Pember catalogued a series of ‘failings’ by staff at the hospital and a GP’s out-of-hours service. Mrs Pember said that, had Harry remained in hospital or been readmitted with a robust care plan, his chances of survival would have been 'enhanced'. But she said she did not feel there had been a 'gross failure' to provide basic medical attention. Recording a narrative verdict, she said: 'Windows of opportunity to treat Harry were lost. These were on the first occasion he was discharged from NGH, the second time when he was only seen for a few hours and when he was seen at an out-of-hours service. 'Had Harry remained in hospital or been readmitted with a robust care plan, his chances of survival would have been enhanced.' The tribunal heard Dr  Arif should have taken more care in assessing  Harry after he was readmitted to hospital . An investigation by the hospital also found that key procedures had not been carried out. After the inquest, the trust apologised to the Connolly family 'for the failings identified by the coroner in the care of their son'. But although Mrs Connolly accepted the hospital's apology, she said she is furious about the tribunal's decision. 'Go and get me 100,000 people off the street, tell them Harry's story and ask if they would be happy for this doctor to treat their child,' she said. The tribunal said Dr Tasnim Arif's (pictured) fitness to practise was not impaired because it did not amount to misconduct . 'I am furious, I can't explain how angry I am. To let her walk away without even a warning is just criminal. God help any child that comes into her care.' Dr Arif faced a fitness to practise hearing in Manchester, accused of allowing her care of Harry to fall ‘seriously below’ what was expected. At the hearing, Dr Arif, who was then a fourth-year specialist trainee paediatric registrar, admitted failing to record the frequency, quantity and volume of Harry’s passage of stool and vomit and to then seek further clarification over these issues. The medic also confessed to not comparing his current weight to his weight when he was previously discharged. But she denied a number of other accusations, including that she had failed to adequately assess Harry's symptoms. The hearing had heard how Harry fell ill at his home on April 23, 2011 and was referred to Northampton General Hospital by the family GP three days later. He was then examined by paediatrician Dr Farhana Shamim, who said he was not dehydrated, but recommended that he be given Dioralyte, a rehydration treatment to boost salt and sugar levels. The following morning, he was discharged by Dr Ayevbekpen Omorgie, who said the parents could have a ‘48-hour open access’ to the ward, meaning he would not need a referral to be seen again, the hearing was told. Then, at around 3.30pm on 28 April, Harry was brought back to hospital by his mother after his parents felt his condition had deteriorated. It was the decisions made on this visit which were the subject of the hearing. The GMC had said that Dr Arif should have exercised 'a greater degree of caution when deciding the appropriate course of action' towards Harry and when discharging him. They argued that the standard of care provided by Dr Arif 'fell seriously below that expected of a registrar'. Mrs Connolly said: 'Harry had diarrhoea and had slept around the clock for days, which was so strange because he never slept. It got to the point where he could barely hold his own head up. 'When we saw Dr Arif, my words to her were: ""He's got really bad diarrhoea, he cannot sustain this, or he is going to become dehydrated"". But she said she was absolutely sure he wasn't dehydrated.' The panel heard that Dr Arif did not think Harry was dehydrated before she discharged him at around 5.45pm on the afternoon of 28 April. But the next day Harry’s condition had deteriorated again, to such an extent that his parents described him as ‘lifeless’. Grandmother Val Faulkner rang the hospital, but was told by a nurse they should take the toddler to their GP or accident and emergency, the tribunal was told. After phoning the GP out-of-hours service, the family spoke to Dr Mary McCracken who said they should bring him in to the out-of-hours service as he may be suffering from dehydration. At the out-of-hours service, Harry was examined by Dr Aboo Thamby who assessed that he was not dehydrated and did not need to be readmitted. Little Harry was twice admitted to Northampton General Hospital (pictured) but was discharged both times . As he continued to be unwell, Mr and Mrs Connolly moved Harry's cot into their bedroom. But in the early hours of May 1, 2011, when Mr Connolly got up to check on his son, he found his son had died. The hearing began in August but was adjourned, before being concluded this week. It was found that Dr Arif had failed to adequately assess or record whether Harry was ‘well hydrated’ or ‘not well hydrated' and also failed to record that Harry was lethargic when taking his history. She was also found guilty of failing to arrange for a longer period of observation and assessment of Harry’s hydration status . But she was cleared of failing to record the right clinical procedures when assessing Harry's hydration, including abnormalities in his respiratory rate and pulse rate. She was also cleared of failing to arrange for the duty consultant to review Harry's status and carrying out blood tests requested by the duty consultant. Despite the 'multiple failings' proved against her, the panel found that Dr Arif's fitness to practise was not impaired because her behaviour did not constitute misconduct. The GMC then asked for a warning to be put on her registration, which was also refused, meaning Dr Arif is free to carry on working unrestricted. The panel said Dr Arif had demonstrated 'genuine insight' into the level of failings and also believed the incident was isolated 'in an otherwise unblemished career'. It added there were no indicators to suggest the doctor's failings would be repeated. Last year the tribunal heard she was working on the children's oncology unit at a hospital in Nottingham. Mrs Connolly said: 'It was not just her decisions that led to my son's death - it was a catalogue of errors. But Dr Arif made some really significant decisions. 'If she was a doctor that had slept with a patient, then she would have been struck off yesterday. I'm not saying doctors should go around sleeping with patients, but what is more serious: that, or a child needlessly dying?' She added: 'It does not matter if it was an isolated incident. If I knocked someone over in my car tomorrow, I would probably be jailed for it, even if I didn't mean to do it.' Mrs Connolly said she is determined to keep fighting and has been talking to a company about a private prosecution. She said: 'I can't change what happened. But I can ensure it does not happen needlessly again. If I don't keep fighting, I'm sure it will happen again - my heart says it will. 'If there is an avenue to go down, we will go down it. I am not a NHS basher, they do a great job and there are far more good doctors than bad. But, when the bad ones do something wrong, why do we let them get away with it? Why can't we just say when they get it wrong?'","Harry Connolly, 19 months, taken to hospital with sickness and diarrhoea .

"A holiday company is targeting a very specific market after launching breaks ideally suited for swingers and nudists. Perhaps taking inspiration from the cult following amassed for the Fifty Shades of Grey phenomenon, Intimate Places are hoping to provide a 'judgement free holiday for open-minded and adventurous adults, couples and singles searching for a fun-filled, wildly expressive experience.' And there's nothing 'seedy' about these holidays, they are aimed at offering luxury resorts around the world. Desire resorts have two bases in Mexico, with both catering for swingers and adults who want to 'experiment' Guests can relax and take advantage of a 'clothing optional' policy on 'Intimate Places' holidays . Going into a travel agency and booking a holiday that can enhance your fantasies, is probably not the most comfortable of conversations to drum up. So Surrey-based company Intimate Places decided to provide a service to help people escape from 'the routine, the confines and the limitations' of 'normal' life. Speaking to MailOnline Travel, Dave Batley, owner of Intimate Places, said: 'We are no different to any other all-inclusive holiday, except we offer different extra-curricular activities. 'We noticed that if people wanted to book these kind of trips, they would have to book the hotel, then the flights, and then any activities separate. Caliente Caribe - Dominican Republic . Desire Pearl Resort - Puerto Morelos, Mexico . Desire Resort & Spa - Puerto Morelos, Mexico . Hedonism II - Negril, Jamaica . Hidden Beach Resort - Mexican Riviera Maya . Sea Mountain Resort - Desert Hot Springs, US . Spice Resort - Lanzarote . Temptation Resort & Spa - Cancun, Mexico . 'By us offering our customers a package holiday, we ensure they are, pardon the pun, fully protected through ATOL. 'We have holidays all around the world, but we are going to have a real look into developing our European offerings. 'I don't think we are any different to a mainstream holiday.' Batley admitted to believing the furore over the release of Fifty Shades of Grey may have contributed to an increased interest in his company's offerings. 'The website crashed last night, and we are just trying to get everything up and running again,' he added. 'We have already had more enquiries than we would expect; but I think we are simply facilitating something that is already there.' There are adults-only cruises to select from, many of which run a 'clothing optional' policy. The website describes these cruises as perfect for 'adventurous couples who want to explore different cultures and countries with freedoms unlike any other cruise.' These are the perfect opportunity to either relax and be at one with your partner, or for those who wish to 'spice things up,' there will be plenty of opportunity to meet with like-minded adults who are keen to explore new 'sexual horizons.' The resorts and locations used for Intimate Places' holiday are luxurious and expansive . The Hidden Beach Resort in Mexico as been specially designed for naturists, from its size down to the secluded location . Of the eight resorts available to guests, Hedonism II in Jamaica provides the greatest scope for engagement for customers. This hotel is exclusively for adults over 18, reaching out in particular to swingers, nudists and people with erotic interests. The majority of guests come from America and it is one of few hotels that also takes singles. Singles also have the chance to share their room with someone of the same sex, not the most comfortingly labelled Single Share Risk, but in doing so they can save 50 per cent. The Spice Resort in Lanzarote has an outdoor jacuzzi that can hold 50 people, making it the ideal spot for couple to meet others. There is also the PLay Room -  the most erotic part of the hotel, and the ideal place for couples to meet other couples. Swingers, nudists and people with erotic interests are welcome at Hedonism II in Negril, Jamaica . Batley added: 'I've worked in the travel industry for many years and have seen the demand for swingers' holidays continue to grow. 'I wanted to create a new company that provides dedicated advice and specialism for those interested in the swingers and naturist lifestyle. We allow the freedom of openly talking about your lifestyle choices without any embarrassment. 'Here at Intimate Places we will listen to your specific wishes and offer tailor-made suggestions on the best resorts and holidays whilst also providing our customers with a top-notch discreet service based on our expertise and understanding.' Prices start from £1,441 per person based on two people sharing and return UK flights at the Desire Resorts in Mexico. A five-night cruise calling at San Juan, Puerto Rico, St Croix and St Marteen, with return flights  start from £1,500 per person.","Intimate Places offers 'judgement free holiday' to couples and singles .

"Domestic violence campaigners are calling for a boycott of the hotly-anticipated Fifty Shades of Grey film because they say it 'glorifies' and 'romanticizes' abuse against women. The National Center on Sexual Exploitation has launched a campaign titled Fifty Shades Is Abuse, which urges people to donate to  local women's shelters instead of buying movie tickets. And Dr. Gail Dines, a professor of sociology and women's studies at Wheelock College in Boston, says she will definitely not be seeing the film because any 'woman who's ever met a real-life Christian Grey does everything she can to avoid repeating it.' The National Center on Sexual Exploitation has launched a campaign titled Fifty Shades Is Abuse, which urges people to donate to local women's shelters instead of buying movie tickets . She adds, in an article for verilymag.com, that the plot 'eroticses violence against women' and renders 'invisible the predatory tactics the 'hero' uses to groom, seduce, and abuse a much younger woman.' Amanda Smith, who is helping run the Fifty Shades Is Abuse initiative, agrees with Dr Dines' standpoint. Commenting on the upcoming release, which contains scenes of bondage and sadomasochism, she told the Associated Press: 'It's such a lie. 'Telling women that they should want to endure this kind of physical abuse and telling them that women want it, and also pushing the lie that if women are obedient and subservient enough, then they can fix a violent and controlling man.' American Family Association President, Tim Wildmon, also believes that  Fifty Shades of Grey topic is not one that should be mainstreamed to audiences aged 17 and up. Hotly-anticipated: Dakota Johnson, left, and Jamie Dornan appear in a scene from Fifty Shades of Grey . Under-fire: The film is getting a big thumbs-down from religious and other groups who say it's degrading to women and endorses sexual violence . 'We'd like to see theater chains refuse to take the movie,' he said. Thistle Pettersen planned to join picketers outside Marcus Point Cinema in Madison, Wisconsin, on Thursday during a protest organized by the feminist Radical Alliance of Women. She said the group would carry rainbow-hued signs in contrast to grey and distribute Valentine's Day cards with information about domestic violence abuse intervention. 'I was really prompted by hearing stories of women who have survived that kind of abuse,' Pettersen, a musician and environmental activist, said. Religious groups have also slammed Fifty Shades of Grey. In a letter to members of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, Buffalo Bishop Richard Malone said the film provided an opportunity to remind the faithful of the church's idea of marriage and 'the moral reprehensibility of all domestic violence and sexual exploitation.' 'The contrast between the message of Fifty Shades of Grey and God's design for self-giving and self-sacrificing love, marriage and sexual intimacy could not be greater,' Malone wrote in his role as the conference's chairman of the committee on Laity, Marriage, Family Life and Youth. Blockbuster: Despite the outcry, theaters are unlikely to take the film off their playlists - here moviegoers are seen queuing for the world premiere of Fifty Shades of Grey in London . Despite the outcry, theaters are unlikely to take the film off their playlists. The ticket-buying site Fandango has said pre-sales have propelled the movie, which stars Jamie Dornan and Dakota Johnson, into the company's all-time Top 5 for R-rated selections, and fans of the book are giddily building the big-screen version into Valentine's weekend plans. The movie - which is set to gross more than $100 million at the box office - opens in theaters Friday. It's based on a best-selling book by E L James about a college student and her torrid affair with a 27-year-old billionaire with a penchant for bondage, discipline, sadism and masochism. James, who wrote the erotic trilogy that launched the film, has heard the backlash and says the critics have it all wrong. 'Who is interested, as a woman, in reading about abuse? Why have these books taken off if they are about abuse?' said James, who discussed the film with the AP over the weekend. 'Domestic violence, rape, are unacceptable. They are not entertaining in any way. 'Let me be absolutely clear. Everything that happens in this book is safe and consensual . . . What do I need to do to convince people?'","The National Center on Sexual Exploitation has launched a campaign titled Fifty Shades Is Abuse .

"A young lawyer has been found stabbed to death in a hotel just five blocks from the White House. David Messerschmitt's body was discovered at The Donovan on Tuesday morning - 24 hours after his wife reported him missing. The couple, who married in 2012, lived together in an apartment just three miles from The Donovan, but police have not yet said why the 30-year-old lawyer was at the four-star hotel. Messerschmitt's wife Kim Vuong said 'everything seemed fine' before he left their home on Sunday, according to the Cincinnati Enquirer. The couple texted that night but he failed to return home. Killed: David Messerschmitt, pictured with his wife Kim Vuong, was found stabbed to death inside a boutique hotel in Washington, D.C. on Tuesday morning, two days after he failed to return home . He was found in a fourth-floor room with multiple stab wounds around 11am on Tuesday, the Washington Post reported. On Wednesday, authorities released surveillance footage showing a dark-clothed 'person of interest' walking into the hotel and impatiently waiting for a lift before walking up the stairs. The images were recorded inside the hotel around 7.45 p.m. on Monday, a day after he failed to come home and the night before the body was found. It is not clear what gender the person is. Police are asking for help identifying the person and have offered a $25,000 reward for information leading to an arrest and conviction. Messerschmitt, whose family lives in Cincinnati, graduated from Ohio State University in 2006 and from the Boston University Law School in 2009. Search: Authorities released images from surveillance footage showing a 'person of interest' at the hotel on Monday evening, the night before Messerschmitt's body was found . Wanted: Before taking the stairs, the unidentified person waits impatiently for an elevator at the hotel . After leaving college, he interned with Susan Dlott, a judge for the U.S. District Court Southern District of Ohio in Cincinnati, the Enquirer reported. 'He was a star, an absolute star,' she told the newspaper. 'I'm just so sick about this. He was the nicest, most wonderful kid you could ever want to meet.' In April 2014, he joined DLA Piper in Washington, D.C., where he worked as an associate. His biography for the firm describes him as an intellectual-property attorney who negotiated commercial and technology agreements, the Post reported. Josh Epstein, a spokesperson in the New York office, said the company was cooperating with police. 'This is an extremely tragic situation and we send our sincere condolences to David’s family,' Epstein said. Scene: He was found killed inside The Donovan, pictured, which is just five blocks from the White House and around three miles from the apartment he shared with his wife. It is not yet clear whey he was at the hotel . Luxury: The boutique hotel is well known for its roof deck and views across Washington DC . Gary Meltz, a spokesperson for the family, also released a statement and asked for privacy. 'We are deeply saddened and shocked by the loss of David, our beloved husband, son, and brother,' the family said in the statement. 'We ask anyone who has information about this crime to please contact the Washington, D.C. Police Department at 202-727-9099.'

"It was once a field of dreams but Michigan’s Pontiac Silverdome is now somewhat of a nightmarish vision. Matt Ervin flew a drone of the stadium to capture haunting images of its crumbling interiors. Only patches of turf remain on the pitch and remnants from the tumbled down roof lay scattered everywhere. Although there's room for more than 80,311 people and 12,000 cars, the empty parking lot has a graveyard-like feel with cracks running through the tarmac. The sports venue - which sits on a 127 acre plot - cost $55.7 million to build back in the early Seventies. It has been closed for almost three years now and developers are yet to announce what the future plans will be. Aerial shot: One of the saddest examples of the dramatic decline of Detroit and the surrounding area is what remains of the Pontiac Silverdome – the once proud home to the Detroit Lions, but which today is an empty shell left that's been left to rot .

Ervin, who captured the Silverdome looking in a sorry state, said: 'Sad to see this stadium in this condition . . . it really needs to go now.' In its heyday the arena hosted the Super Bowl, a pope, the NBA finals, Led Zeppelin, Elvis, WrestleMania and dozens of other world-class acts and sporting events. Almost 100,000 people would pack into the house. But that all changed in 2002, when the NFL team moved to Ford Field in Detroit and the Silverdome soon fell into disrepair. The stadium has had an uncertain fate ever since, as the city tried to find use for it - including monster truck rallies, boxing matches and as a drive-in theater - and the population in Pontiac dwindled. Triple Investment Properties bought the Silverdome in 2009 for $583,000, but plans to turn it into a soccer stadium never materialized. 'They had a half-a-million-dollar soccer field they bought that was put in there as well as paying for maintenance of $1.5 million a year up until the roof caved in,' said Jim Passeno of RJM Auctioneers, who in June organized a nine day auction that raised about $500,000. Turf that still featured the Lions' logo from both end zones was auctioned for $1,600 each, while copper wiring proved very popular and raised $500,000. Now, what once was one of the premier venues in the world is a tattered, empty reminder of the stadium's memorable past - and of the dismal economy in Michigan.

"Misting machines were introduced on the fresh produce counters at Morrisons to create an impression of freshness. Everything from lettuces to loose tomatoes were constantly sprayed with fine droplets of water, giving the idea they had just arrived, fresh out of the ground. The resulting fog was part of the ‘retail theatre’ introduced by chief executive, Dalton Philips, who arrived from running a retail chain in Canada to spread a little magic over Morrisons and its sales. The misters keeping this asparagus fresh are soon to be a thing of the past at Morrisons . The machines are to go, despite having been installed in some 300 Morrisons supermarkets . However, it seems they were a little too fancy for customers of Morrisons, which has decided to pull down the curtain on this particular show. Mr Philips was ousted last month following a vicious campaign from an old guard of company executives, including Sir Ken Morrison, the former chairman and son of the founder of the chain. Traditionally, Morrisons, which was founded in Bradford in 1899, built the layout of its stores around the theme of a street market with green grocer, butcher and baker. The set-up appealed to customers in the north, where the brand is strong, who had a reputation for being careful with their money. Consequently, the decision to bring in the misting machines, which has since been copied by some other stores, was something of a surprise. Now, after spending a large sum of money installing the machines in some 300 of the chain’s supermarkets, the new management at Morrisons have decided to get rid of them. It is not a moment too soon for Sir Ken, who has long argued the machines highlighted how Mr Philips had alienated core shoppers, many of whom have switched to budget rivals Aldi and Lidl. One of Mr Philips’s biggest critics, Roger Owen, a former long-serving main board director, has been lobbying the company’s chairman, Andy Higginson, to get rid of the machines. ‘You don’t need misting. It is a waste of money, a waste of time and it does carry a risk unless you spend a significant amount on maintenance,’ he said. ‘I said one of the first things Andy Higginson should do is take it out, which he obviously has done and good on him. Former Morrisons chief executive Dalton Philips was ousted last month and now his misters are to go too . ‘If this is an indicator of his intention that he has already spoken about of getting the business back to its core values and core strengths, then this is a step in the right direction and a very, very visible one.’ Morrisons’ group retail director Martyn Fletcher told staff about the decision to dump the misting machines earlier this week. A spokesman said: ‘This move is about going back to basics, using simpler refrigeration techniques and Morrisons’ traditional strengths in fresh food management to ensure our vegetables stay fresh.’ Morrisons did not actually fare too badly in recent sales figures compared to rivals . The U-turn represents an end to what has been dubbed the ‘war of fog’ between Mr Philips and his detractors. The former chief executive has always proudly defended the misting machines, which were used particularly in the South East, where stores attract a more middle class shopper. He gave an interview to Retail Week last month saying: ‘I will refute until my last day about taking the stores upmarket, we did not do that. 'There are parts of the south of England which I think have benefitted from the slightly different assortment and I don’t regret that. ‘Misty veg is in our competitors now. The most important thing is whether our customers liked it or not.’ The misting machines were part of a radical make-over for the Morrisons chain carried out by Mr Philips, who became chief executive in 2010. He also introduced an online shopping service and began opening small convenience stores to tap into changing shopping habits. This week, industry sales figures were released suggesting his radical ideas were beginning to bear fruit, however the improvement came too late to save Mr Philips and his job. Figures from Kantar Worldpanel show sales were down by 0.4per cent over the past 12 weeks compared to the same period last year. This was the best performance by the chain for a year and much better than Asda and Sainsbury’s.","‘Retail theatre’ was introduced by former chief executive Dalton Philips .

"Thousands of the over-55s were warned about fraudsters abusing new pension freedoms by Pensions Minister Steve Webb – after he was targeted in a text scam. From April, older workers will be able to cash in their pension for the first time and spend as they choose, rather than being forced to buy an annuity. But in an assault on Britain’s nest eggs, criminals are contacting workers and encouraging them to invest their pension pot in everything from dodgy wealth funds to overseas properties which do not exist. Pensions Minister Steve Webb, pictured, admitted he had been targeted by a text-based fraud gang . Others are trying to get their hands on people’s life savings by offering them free ‘advice’ on the new reforms and asking them to hand over personal financial information. Now, Mr Webb has told people approaching retirement to be ‘on their guard’ after being contacted himself by a firm offering to ‘review’ his pension savings. Speaking at a conference hosted by the Resolution Foundation think tank, he said he had received a text message just minutes earlier from a suspicious-sounding company. He told the audience ‘I was sitting upstairs and my phone went. I got a text. I thought it would be my daughter asking for money, but, actually, it says: ‘If you have a frozen pension prior to 55 you are now entitled to a free review. Please call back. He joked: ‘Should I call?’, before issuing a stark warning, saying: ‘People are going to have access to an awful lot of cash and wherever there is cash there are crooks. ‘It’s a big issue. ‘Of course we will do what we can to drive out the crooks. ‘But you will never be always ahead of the game and we need everyone top realise there are lots of people out there who want to take your money and do not very good things with it.’ Pension firms have warned that conmen are targeting people in their early to mid-50s who have heard they can soon withdraw their entire pension to spend it or invest it as they choose. Minister Webb warned people  to be careful about where they invest their pension nest egg, file photograph . But Mr Webb said the Government was aware that criminals were capitalising on the new pension freedoms and were doing ‘a huge amount of work’ behind the scenes to track them down. He said: ‘There is more going on than I can say because we don’t want the bad guys to know what we are up to. But buyer awareness is really very important.’ Under radical reforms announced in the Budget, people will soon be able to use their pension like a ‘bank account’ rather than being forced to invest it in a guaranteed monthly income for life. It follows complaints that annuities had become poor value for money. In two months’ time, over-55s can either withdraw the full amount or take it in chunks. The first 25 per cent of each withdrawal will be tax-free and the rest will be taxed as income. Experts have warned the popular reforms will be a ‘massive turbo-boost to fraudsters’ who are trying to persuade people to invest in high-risk or non-existent exotic investment schemes. The Government has offered everyone access to free, independent guidance before accessing their money. But conmen are using talk of ‘pension freedoms’ to trick those confused by the changes and offering their own guidance or ‘pension reviews’ to attract victims, including setting up stands in shopping centres. A recent study found two in five people have already received messages via email or text inviting them to review their pension or release some of it as cash, according to a new study of UK adults. Worryingly, more than a quarter said they were tempted to take up the offer, and one in seven said they had contacted the schemes. Nearly a quarter of those surveyed also said they were unsure sure what to do with their pension when they reach 55. Steve Hyndman, of pension firm Phoenix Group, which commissioned the survey, said: ‘People can lose their life savings through these scams. ‘And unfortunately, they are likely to be very successful. ‘From April, thousands of people will have access to their funds. For many, it might be the first time they have had access to a lump sum and they will be looking for places to invest it. They will be vulnerable to these kinds of cons. ‘If some invests in a scam at 55 but does not retire until they are 70, they may also not even notice their money has gone missing until they try to access it years later when they need it.’ He said other scams tried to convince under 55s that they too should withdraw their pension pot. However, this incurs a huge 55 per cent tax charge and the conmen then take up to 30 per cent of the remainder, leaving the victim penniless. The Association of British Insurers spokesman claims the threat to consumers is ‘evolving’, saying: ‘Our members have noticed schemes offering unrealistic returns in dubious and risky unregulated investments; and adverts falsely claiming links with pension flexibility and guidance about retirement options being introduced in April 2015.’","Pensions Minister Steve Webb was targeted by a text-based fraud gang .

"Hell hath no fury like a mother rear-ended. A high-speed car chase in Dallas, Texas was brought to an end Wednesday afternoon when carjacker Artai Alexander, 40, slammed into the minivan driven by Jessica Leismann at an intersection. Aerial footage shows the aftermath of the crash, as maternal instinct kicks in and Leismann jumps out of the car, confronts Alexander and then throws him to the ground as police come in for the arrest. Scroll down for video . Road rage: Robbery suspect Artai Alexander slammed a stolen white Dodge Challenger into the silver minivan driven by Jessica Leismann Wednesday afternoon in Dallas, Texas . Protecting her cub: Aerial footage shows the moment Ms Leismann jumped out of her car and attacked Alexander until police showed up to make an arrest . Natural instinct: Ms Leismann (left) and her boyfriend Charles Cook were picking up their kids from school when the incident happened. She says the maternal instinct kicked in and prompted her to confront Alexander (right) Ms Leismann and her boyfriend Charles Cook had just picked up their 13-year-old son TJ from middle school and were on their way to pick up their younger daughter when the accident happened. 'I jumped out the car and said, ""What the hell is wrong with you, you’re in a school zone, what are you thinking?""' Ms Leismann told NBC DFW. After losing her 4-year-old son Jaylen to epilepsy last year, Leismann says she was spurred to action at the thought of another one of her children dying. The chase started Wednesday afternoon around 3:30pm when Drecelus Hunter was carjacked at gunpoint at a convenience store by Alexander. 'I walked up to the car and he pointed the gun at me,' Hunter told WFAA of the moment Alexander stole his white Dodge Challenger. Ms Leismann's 13-year-old son TJ was in the car at the time of the accident and they were waiting at an intersection in a school zone . Robbery suspect Alexander store the white Dodge Challenger at a convenience store and proceeded on a high speed chase for 20 minutes before coming to a stop . Police arrested Alexander and booked him in the Dallas County Jail on charged of aggravated assault and resisting arrest . He allegedly kept telling Ms Leismann to let him go while she was throwing hits at the scene of the crash . Ms Leismann's boyfriend (in striped hoodie) mostly acted as a buffer between his girlfriend and Alexander . Alexander then went on a 20-minute high-speed chase with police that ended at the intersection where Ms Leismann was waiting. Alexander clearly didn't know what he was getting into when Ms Leismann came barreling out of the driver's seat to the car. 'I think he ran up against a mama bear,' an officer at the scene said. Ms Leismann's boyfriend got out of the car as well to confront Alexander but mostly acted as a buffer between the two. 'She was yelling at the dude, ""Look what you did to my car! Look what you did to my car!""' Cook said. 'And I could hear him saying, ""Just let me go, let me go!"" And she was like, ""No, you're not going nowhere! Look what you just did to my car!"" 'I was yelling all kinds of things that I may not remember... but I hope he does,' Liesmann said. Ms Leismann's 13-year-old son TJ (left) says he's proud of his mother.

Once she gets mad, it's over,' Mr Cook said of his girlfriend. Ms Leismann threw Alexander to the ground one last time before police swarmed around to make an arrest. She then went to comfort her son who appeared to be shaken up from the crash. TJ was later taken to the hospital for evaluation. He told reporters he wasn't surprised at all that his mom would have jumped to his defense. 'My mom did put him in his place,' TJ said. 'I’m glad he is in jail because to be honest when I was in the car, I thought I died.' Alexander was booked in the Dallas County Jail and is expected to be charged with aggravated robbery and evading arrest.","The dramatic incident was caught on camera on a busy freeway in Dallas .

"A young Russian woman has died after dropping her charging iPhone into the water while she was taking a bath. Moscow resident Evgenia Sviridenko, 24, was found lifeless in the bath by her female housemate who had grown concerned about why she had been silent in the bathroom for so long. Miss Sviridenko is understood to have been using the phone to look at her social media page on VKontakte - the Russian version of Facebook - when the accident occured. It has not yet been established why the charger didn't cut out as licensed Apple products are designed to do. Tragic: Moscow resident Evgenia Sviridenko, 24, was found lifeless in the bath by her female housemate who had grown concerned about why she had been silent in the bathroom for so long . Unfortunate: Miss Sviridenko is understood to have been using the phone to look at her social media page on VKontakte - the Russian version of Facebook - when the accident occured . Speaking to local media from the apartment the two young women shared with Miss Sviridenko, Yaroslav Dubinina, 23, said: 'I noticed that she had been gone a while, and when I couldn't raise her I opened the door and saw her floating on the water looking really pale.' 'I saw her phone which was on the charger and at the bottom of the bath, and I unplugged it and pulled her out...Her body was still shaking from the shock,' she added. Police are now investigating why the phone charger did not apparently cut out and refused to reveal whether it was a licensed Apple product or not. Russian media said Miss Sviridenko's iPhone 4 had still been working despite falling into the water because an automatic update had been posted on her social media page saying she had called the emergency services telephone number. Miss Dubinina said that her friend had recently arrived in Moscow from her home in Omsk and they had decided to share a flat together as neither of them could afford a flat on their own. Russian media said Miss Sviridenko's iPhone 4 had still been working despite falling into the water because an automatic update had been posted on her social media page saying she called the emergency services . Miss Sviridenko's death comes just days after a 16-year-old Russian girl died after taking her charging iPhone into a shower. A regional Investigative Committee spokesperson said initial tests had suggested the girl died from an electric shock but that the investigation was ongoing. Again it is not known whether the charger used in the second incident in Russia's Bashkortostan Republic was a licensed Apple product or whether it was a  fake. VKontakte, known as VK, is the largest Russian-language social network in Europe and is particularly popular in Russia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Ukraine. As of November 2014, VK had at least 280 million accounts and is the second most visited website in Russia, after the Google-style search engine Yandex.","Evgenia Sviridenko, 24, was found lifeless in the bath by her housemate .

"An American teenager is eager to become a citizen of the country she was born in, but has had no luck thanks to her parents decision to never legally register her. Alecia Pennington, 19, claims that she was born at home and then never sent to school, taught instead by her mother. What's more, her parents never got her a birth certificate or a social security number she claims, which has made it impossible for her to receive any of the rights of an American citizen. However, her mother, Lisa Pennington, is telling a far different story. Scroll down for video . Alecia Pennington (above) claims that she was born at home and then never sent to school, taught instead by her mother . The 19-year-old is therefore unable to show proof of her identity, and cannot get a birth certificate . Alecia has made a video in a bid to get some support, or help, obtaining the documents she claims to need to declare herself an American citizen. 'I was homeschooled my entire life, so I had no school records,' Pennington explains. 'Also, never been to the hospital, so I have no medical records. This leaves me with nothing to prove my identity or citizenship.' Should this be true, she would be a victim of identification abuse. It seems that Alecia, who is one of nine children, left her home last September, with the help of her grandparents on her mother's side. Alecia is one of nine children (above with their father), and left her home last September, with the help of her grandparents on her mother's side . Alecia's mother Lisa (left with Alecia and her three sisters) claims her daughter is misleading people . Her mother, a popular blogger in the homeschool community, wrote about this, but has since taken the post down on her blog, The Pennington Point. Mrs. Pennington also posted a video in response to Alecia's video on YouTube, but took that down as well. Alecia does have older siblings, and it is unclear if they have licenses or any form of identification, though her mother has claimed they do. She also claims that her daughter does have a birth certificate to the best of her knowledge. It is also worth noting that after Alecia released this video and started a Help Me Prove It Facebook and Twitter page, her father bought the domain name, making it impossible for her to use.

"Two men who led a drunk teenager from a nightclub to an alleyway where they subjected her to a rape 'of the most squalid kind' were today jailed for nine years each. A judge told Craig Whitelaw and Kristofer McLaren they used the 'drunk and vulnerable' woman as a 'play thing' in a 50-minute ordeal that left her looking as though she had been in a fight. Appearing at Teesside Crown Court, the two 21-year-olds were each convicted of one count of rape, while Whitelaw was also found guilty of a further charge of sexual assault. Both men will have to sign the sex offenders register for life. Jailed: Craig Whitelaw, left, and Kristofer McLaren, right, both 21, are beginning nine-year jail sentences for 'a rape of the most squalid kind' after they attacked a woman they had just met on the dancefloor of a nightclub . Jailing the pair, Mr Justice Males told them their victim was 'so drunk that she was vulnerable and defenceless to your exploitation.' But, he told them, 'there should be no doubt that what you did was still rape, and rape of the most squalid kind.' 'Your victim was very unwise to allow herself to drink so much that she became so thoroughly inebriated,' the judge said. 'But it was you, and only you, who deliberately took advantage of her condition, to take her to a dark alley to see what fun you could have with her. 'It's just lasses attention-seeking': What Whitelaw, pictured arriving at court for an earlier hearing, said of the victim after he was arrested by police . 'It was you who decided to treat her body as a plaything on which to act out your sordid fantasies of having a threesome.' McLaren, of Thirsk, North Yorkshire, and Whitelaw, of Sutton, near Thirsk, had denied the charges against them. They claimed their victim had instigated the sexual encounter and had consented throughout. But at the end of a nine-day trial a jury of ten men and two women rejected their accounts. In a victim impact statement, the traumatised victim - who had never before had a sexual experience - said she had worried for some months that she had contracted an STD and also feared that she may have been pregnant. Whitelaw and McLaren had been drinking for most of the day before going to Club Amadeus, a popular dance venue in Northallerton, North Yorkshire. They they met the 18-year-old victim for the first time on the dance floor and shared a kiss. But within 11 minutes, they had steered her outside and down a nearby alleyway. Prosecutor Paul Newcombe told the court that the pair took advantage of the fact she was intoxicated. CCTV showed her 'stumbling repeatedly and often' as she was led out of the night club. What followed was a fifty minute ordeal which left McLaren and Whitelaw's victim looking as though she had been in a fight. When they had finished with her, McLaren and Whitelaw ignored their bleeding victim's pleas for help finding her friends; instead they left her in the dark alleyway and caught a a cab away from the scene. Laughing and joking as they made their way home, they even boasted to the driver about what they had just done, police said. When Whitelaw was arrested, he admitted having sex, but claimed it was consensual, and said: 'It's just lasses attention-seeking.' Inebriated: Whitelaw and McLaren had been drinking for most of the day before going to Club Amadeus, pictured, a popular dance venue in Northallerton, North Yorkshire, where they met their victim . Detective Inspector Fiona Wynne of Northallerton's Protecting Vulnerable Persons Unit had helped to investigate the case. She welcomed the sentences. 'I am delighted that justice has been delivered for the victim. She was subjected to a sustained attack by McLaren and Whitelaw. They treated her like a piece of meat and left her bleeding and distressed,' said DI Wynne. 'They laughed and joked about it afterwards, even boasting to the taxi driver about what had just happened when they left the scene. 'I can't imagine how any woman would feel after such an ordeal, but it is particularly distressing that it was the victim's first sexual experience and she will have to live with that for the rest of her life.' The victim's family thanked the police and their partner organisations for the support they had shown their daughter throughout her ordeal. 'From the minute the police picked our daughter up she has been treated with the utmost respect and sympathy by everyone who has had contact with her,' the family said in a statement. 'This includes every police officer involved, the support services and the court officials. We would like to extend our thanks to all concerned. 'Everyone has acted with a high degree of professionalism, but at the same time have been very kind. Thank you.' The number of recorded sexual offences is at a 10-year high, official figures show. In the year to March 2014 there were a total of 64,205 sex crime incidents across England and Wales, an increase of a fifth on the previous year. Within that, the number of rapes increased 26 per cent to 20,745 incidents, while the number of other sexual offences increased 17 per cent fo 43,460 incidents. The Office for National Statistics said the increases may in part be because victims are more willing to come forward after the high-profile prosecutions of public figures such as Rolf Harris and Fred Talbot. 'While some of these increases will be a direct consequence of the historical crimes reported as part of Operation Yewtree, there is evidence to suggest that there has been a wider ""Yewtree effect"",' the ONS said in a statement. 'This refers to an increased willingness on the part of victims of sexual offences that are not directly connected to Yewtree to come forward to report both historical and recent sexual offences.'","Craig Whitelaw and Kristofer McLaren used their victim 'as a plaything'

"The friend and mentor of Bali Nine drug smuggler Myuran Sukumaran says the 33-year-old is no longer sleeping as he waits with dread for a final knock on his door to take him to his execution by firing squad. Artist Ben Quilty, who said goodbye to Sukumaran at Kerobokan prison in Bali for the last time on Thursday, explained the process has begun for Sukumaran and Andrew Chan's imminent execution. 'He knows someone will knock on his door in the middle of the night. I offered to bring him valium but he said ""no"". He is completely free from drugs and won't even take sleeping pills,' Quilty told ABC radio. The Australian artist, who in 2011 won the Archibald Prize, has been Sukumaran's mentor since 2012, helping him develop a talent for painting. Chan and Sukumaran were leaders of the so-called Bali Nine, who were found guilty of attempting to smuggle more than 8 kg of heroin valued at about $4 million from Indonesia to Australia in 2005. Scroll down for video . Mr Sukumaran is passionate painter who has been conducting art classes to other inmates while in Kerobokan jail. The classes have been his way of showing he has rehabilitated . Sukumaran's friend and mentor, artist Ben Quilty, said goodbye to him at Kerobokan prison in Bali for the last time on Thursday . A general view shows the death island of Nusa Kambangan island, upon which Indonesia's maximum security prison is located and prisoners on death row are executed . They were arrested at Bali's Denpasar airport and their case has taken on enormous resonance as a domestic political issue in Australia. Sukumaran has begun what may well be his final painting after finding a photo of the Indonesian island where he will likely be shot and killed. 'He's found an image of the island where his execution will take place and wants to make a painting. I hope it's not the last he makes but it's the beginnings of a great painting,' Quilty said. Sukumaran has been on death row for almost ten years but Quilty, who has been leading the Mercy Campaign for the Bali Nine pair, said on Thursday his spirits were high after Foreign Minister Julie Bishop and Deputy Labor leader Tanya Plibersek pleaded for their lives to be spared in parliament.

Indonesian police tighten security at the main gate of maximum security prison Nusa Kambangan . But later in the day, events took a turn for the worse and their moods plummeted when it was confirmed permission had been granted to move them from Kerobokan prison, setting the wheels in motion for their death. 'By the afternoon things had gone dark, it was very bleak leaving them there,' Quilty said. 'We thought he'd be fine. I said one day we'd be sat on a veranda out in the bush smoking a pipe and drinking vodka together, now that looks like it will never happen.' Quilty explained yesterday was the first time Sukumaran let out a tear when he said goodbye to his friend. 'The inevitability of it is brutal. He handled it better than I did.' A meeting on Thursday granted permission to move the Bali Nine drug smugglers on a date which will be determined on Friday. Australia's efforts to stop the executions have so far failed, along with desperate legal bids. Mr Sukumaran stands in front of his paintings at a prisoners' studio in Kerobokan prison .

A man displays a painting of Myuran Sukumaran, a Australian convicted of drug smuggling on Indonesia's death row, outside Kerobokan jail where Sukumaran is held . Barrister Julian McMahon says for now, his clients are still alive, so efforts to keep it that way continue. On Wednesday, the Indonesian Administrative Court received a challenge of President Joko Widodo's decision to refuse clemency to all 64 drug offenders on death row. His decrees state the decision comes 'after thoroughly considering the clemency application'. But Mr McMahon says this is untrue. 'All of the public statements from the Indonesian government made it clear that the applications would be refused because they were drug offenders,' he said. 'That policy prevented careful consideration, indeed any consideration of the particular cases.' The lawyers argue it would be a grave miscarriage of justice for the executions to proceed before the court determines whether the decision to refuse clemency is in accordance with the law.

However, Indonesia's Attorney-General HM Prasetyo, who hasn't shied away from commenting on the men's cases before the courts, says he won't delay with his execution plans. Chan and Sukumaran are expected to be moved to Nusakambangan, a prison island off central Java known as 'Indonesia's Alcatraz'. The Australian Broadcasting Corporation reported that it understood officials have been speaking to airport authorities and Garuda - the national carrier - which has apparently agreed to fly the men to the place where the executions will take place. They will be given 72 hours notice of their execution by firing squad. Their Sydney families are in Bali, where they have spent the past three weeks paying daily visits to the men in Kerobokan jail. Over the past decade they've been imprisoned there, Chan and Sukumaran have transformed into model inmates, who have helped scores of others rehabilitate and get drug-free. In this photo taken on August 17, 2010, convicted Australian drug smugglers Myuran Sukumaran (L) and Andrew Chan (R) gesture as they sit inside Kerobokan prison in Denpasar, Bali . Mr Chan has been in jail in Bali since 2005 after his arrest at at Bali's Denpasar airport . The execution process awaiting Chan and  Sukumaran has been described as cruel by a witness to a previous one. In the dead of night in 2008, in a remote clearing on the Indonesian island of Nusakambangan, Nigerian nationals Samuel Iwuchukwu Okoye and Hansen Antonious Nwaolisa were executed by firing squad after being sentenced to death for smuggling more than 3kg of heroin each. It took seven minutes before the two condemned men strapped to wooden crosses bled out on the jungle floor. . An account given in 2008 by Irish Catholic priest Charlie Burrows, who was at the executions of Okoye and Nwaolisa, says their deaths were neither quick nor painless; they were tortured, 'moaning again and again for seven minutes', as they slowly died. 'I think it is cruel, the torture,' he said at the time in testimony before Indonesia's Constitutional Court. Okoye and Nwaolisa had been strapped to crucifixes with inner-tubes. Black hoods were placed over their heads. 'It was simple: one, two, three, then bang,' Father Burrows said. Both men have vowed that their time in jail has rehabilitated them and they deserve a reprieve . 'The blood came out slowly; they were in pain. After 10 minutes, a doctor came to inspect them and pronounced them dead.' If executed like Okoye and Nwaolisa, the two Australians will have their hands and feet shackled before being taken from their cells before midnight and driven to a remote execution site. They will be given stark choices: die standing, sitting or kneeling. If necessary, they will be tied to a pole and will have the choice of being blindfolded. Twelve executioners with rifles - three of them with live rounds - will be told to aim at targets over their hearts. 'Executions are not clean killings,' their Australian lawyer, Julian McMahon, told AAP in January. 'What, in fact, happens is that the prisoner is taken out into the bush. It's usually at night. If necessary, they are tied to a plank. 'If the prisoner isn't dead straight away, the commanding officer is meant to walk up and then put a bullet in the head.' Sukumaran and Chan will be executed together. Australian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop made a last-ditch plea for the two men to be taken off death row .

"Flames erupt into the sky from a skiff floating adrift in the Indian Ocean, a powerful demonstration of the Royal Navy’s might as it fights the scourge of Somali piracy. The boat was blown out of the water by a Merlin helicopter, flown from HMS Westminster, which strafed the vessel, setting fire to fuel tanks. The pirate crew fled to another vessel before the attack, but were among 12 arrested without a fight by boarding teams from the frigate shortly after.

Fire from HMS Westminster's Merlin 502 strafes the boat before it bursts into flames . The Merlin 502 flies off after destroying the pirate skiff in an awesome display of force . HMS Westminster is boosting security off the East African coast as part of Combined Task Force 150, one of three international naval groups set up to defeat terrorism, tackle piracy and stop the trafficking of people and drugs. It has carried out three counter-piracy missions in a seven-month tour of duty in the Indian Ocean. The 4,900-ton vessel, with 185 crew, has played a key role in deterring bandits who prey on merchant ships off the volatile Horn of Africa, seizing hostages and demanding huge ransoms. A Navy spokesman said: ‘Using the Merlin’s powerful sensors, we found the suspected pirates and identified weapons, excessive fuel, ladders and more people than you would expect to find for any other purpose in small boats, hundreds of miles from land in the Indian Ocean. ‘Faced with an overwhelming display of force, the suspected pirates immediately surrendered.’ Photographs of last month’s successful operation were released yesterday by the Ministry of Defence. Boarding teams from HMS Westminster begin to board a pirate vessel containing 12 suspected pirates . The operation was launched as the EU extended its counter-piracy operation off the coast of Somalia . HMS Westminster also smashed a gang of terrorist drug smugglers who were caught trafficking pure heroin worth £14million last month. Seventy bales containing 400lb of the class-A drug were seized. The raid was hailed as ‘a dark day for terrorists’ after intelligence suggested the yellow packages were due to be traded to fund terror groups such as Al Qaeda. The EU's naval mission logo. A European naval helicopter fired at pirate-owned supplies on the Somali coastline today . Meanwhile, European anti-piracy forces yesterday carried out their first air attack on mainland Somalia, strafing a beach from a helicopter and destroying pirate boats, fuel supplies and an arms cache. The helicopter from the EU Naval Force struck pirate bases near the port of Haradheere, 220 miles north of the capital Mogadishu. The night raid, launched from one of nine European warships patrolling nearby, was designed to ‘make life as difficult for pirates on land as we’re making it at sea’, an EU military official said. It was ordered after weeks of surveillance from aircraft. Five small attack boats were ‘rendered inoperable’ and pirates said the strike also hit drums of diesel and a weapons store. ‘An unidentified helicopter destroyed five of our hunting boats early in the morning,’ said one pirate, who identified himself only as Abdi. ‘We were setting off from the shore when the helicopter attacked us. We ran away.’ The EU recently agreed to expand its anti-piracy mission, Operation Atalanta, to let forces attack land targets as well as those at sea. No one was injured in yesterday’s raid, which did not involve British forces.","EU's new anti-pirate force attacks bases on the coastline for the first time .

"Every festival-goer worth her backstage pass has a flower crown these days. But none are quite as impressive as the headpiece sported by Gwyneth Paltrow in the latest issue of Harper's Bazaar. The actress-turned-lifestyle guru joined Demi Moore and Nicole Richie to pose for a feature about celebrity florist Eric Buterbaugh. The publication of the story is timely: Mr Buterbaugh is in the midst of his busiest period - awards season. Ring o' roses: Gwyneth Paltrow wears the flower crown to end all flower crowns in a photo shoot celebrating her friend and florist Eric Buterbaugh in Harper's Bazaar . 'Besides the parties, it's all the flowers you have to send people, send to the stars, the thank-you for wearing the dress, the thank-you to the stylist for getting the person to wear the dress,' he tells the magazine. 'Oscars week, there's blood on the shop floor.' And a glamorous 'shop floor' it is. The florist operates his business from a suite at the Four Seasons Hotel in Beverly Hills. It's only fitting when one is creating bouquets that cost upwards of $600. Mr Buterbaugh counts his Bazaar photoshoot co-stars as longtime friends as well as clients. In fact, Ms Moore  - who also posed with a flower crown - calls him her 'best friend.' Describing their first encounter, at a birthday party in 2002, she recalled: 'In those days I used to carry around with me a small, hard cooler full of Red Bull and I smoked Marlboro Reds. Blooming marvelous: Demi Moore, Mr Buterbaugh's 'best friend' also gets the flower crown treatment . Hollywood's finest: Mr Buterbaugh counts his photoshoot co-stars as longtime friends as well as clients . 'So as I was waiting by myself for my car to come, sitting on my little cooler, Eric looked over at me and said, ""I like you, because you're just not right."" And we've been best friends ever since.' The March issue of Harper's Bazaar is on newsstands from February 17 . Mr Buterbaugh, who worked for Gianni Versace before becoming a florist in the late Nineties, is in demand across the globe. He created the flowers for Princess Beatrice's 18th birthday party at Windsor Castle, completed commissions for the King of Thailand and designed the blooms for Salma Hayek's 2009 wedding to François-Henri Pinault at the Venice opera house. Speaking of the latter, he said: 'It was a three-day affair with the most amazing group of people—Bono even sang. 'The vases were so delicate that they had to be brought to the opera house along with the flowers on these tiny little motorboats that could navigate the canals without the glass breaking.' In another recent interview, this time with Vogue.com.au, Mr Buterbaugh says he is lucky that most of his famous clients give him free creative rein. 'For me, good taste in flowers is a bouquet or arrangement that has beautiful flow and that the flowers have breathing room,' he said. 'A lot of florists just cram, cram, cram flowers in and I want to look at it and cry. It’s like the flowers are choking for air. 'Too many ingredients or colours – for me that’s horrible.'

"A Montana homeowner was sentenced Thursday to 70 years in prison, with no parole for at least 20 years, in the shotgun killing of a German exchange student who was trespassing in his garage. District Judge Ed McLean said Markus Kaarma was hunting, not safeguarding his home when he shot 17-year-old Diren Dede early one April morning. 'Here you have a 12-gauge shotgun, not to protect your family but to go after someone,' the judge told Kaarma. 'And go after someone you did.' Convicted: Markus Kaarma stands in Missoula County District Court while Judge Ed McLean sentences him to 70 years in prison for the shooting death of German exchange student Diren Dede on Thursday . Victim: Markus Kaarma shot Diren Dede (seen left and right), who was unarmed, after being alerted by motion sensors in his garage. Witnesses said Kaarma fired at the teen four times, striking him twice . A Missoula jury convicted Kaarma, 30, of deliberate homicide in the case that caused an outcry in Germany and brought scrutiny to Montana's law allowing the use of deadly force in some situations to protect home and family. Kaarma faced between 10 to 100 years in prison. He shot Dede, who was unarmed, after being alerted by motion sensors in his garage. Witnesses said Kaarma fired at the teen four times, striking him twice. McLean was quoted by the Missoulian as also saying in court Thursday to Kaarma 'You pose too great a risk to society to be anywhere else but the Montana State Prison. Good luck to you, son.' Dede's father, Celal Dede, said of the sentence: 'It is justice. I am not happy. My son is dead.' He and his wife attended the entire trial, and he flew back from Germany for Thursday's hearing. Kaarma sat staring down during much of the proceeding, occasionally glancing around the crowded courtroom. He sported buzz-cut, dark hair and an orange jail suit. 'I'm sorry my actions caused the death of Mr. Dede,' Kaarma told the judge. Before handing down the sentence, McLean heard testimony from Kaarma's girlfriend, a detective, the teen's host parents in Missoula and others. According to the Missoulian, host father Randy Smith testified 'Diren's murder has turned [our lives] into a whirlwind of shock, grief and sadness. 'It's one of those things that you see on the TV news, not here, not to us. It's literally sucked all the joy out of our family. Every day is a grind now. We just do what we have to do to get through the day. Kaarma's mother, Chong Kaarma, pleaded for leniency for the sake of her grandson, asking the judge to let the boy have his father as soon as possible. She apologized to Celal Dede from the stand. He replied from his front-row seat: 'Why did you wait? Too late.' Kaarma's girlfriend, Janelle Pflager, testified she has received death threats against her 19-month-old son with and Kaarma. She called Kaarma the 'single-most misunderstood person I have ever met.' 'He didn't want to kill anyone,' she said. 'He only wanted to make sure he and myself and son were alive at the end.' Missoula County Attorney Karla Painter later asked Pflager if she said during a phone call with Kaarma in jail that she and Kaarma wouldn't pay for the Dedes' 'dirty rat son' to be sent back to Germany for burial. Pflager said she didn't recall saying that. Family: Celal Dede, right, father of slain German student Diren Dede speaks while his attorney Bernard Docke listens in Missoula on Thursday. Dede said of Kaarma's sentence 'It is justice. I am not happy. My son is dead' Student: Diren Dede, from Hamburg, Germany, was studying at Missoula's Big Sky High School and planned to leave the U.S. after the school term ended a few weeks after the shooting . Prosecutors argued Kaarma was intent on luring an intruder into his garage after it was burglarized at least once in the weeks before the shooting. Three witnesses testified they heard Kaarma say he'd been waiting up nights to shoot an intruder. On the night of the shooting, authorities said, Kaarma left his garage door partially open. He fired four shotgun blasts, pausing between the third and fourth shots, witnesses said. Lead detective Guy Baker testified that the first three shots were low and seemed to follow Dede as he moved across the garage. But the fourth shot was aimed higher and struck Dede in the head, Baker said. The Missoulian reported that Dr. Douglas Johnson said Kaarma has mental health issues, including anxiety, and that he stated 'I am confident that Markus Kaarma was remorseful. He has strong feelings, but has difficulty expressing that.' However, the newspaper quoted McLean as saying to Kaarma '[Your anxiety] doesn't excuse the anguish you have caused. Anxiety isn't an excuse.' Kaarma's lawyers argued the Missoula man feared for his life, didn't know if the intruder was armed, and was on edge because of a previous burglary. Montana is among more than 30 states with expanded rights for residents to use deadly force to protect their homes or themselves, sometimes known as 'stand your ground' laws. Kaarma said in court in December that he never intended to hurt anyone that night. His attorneys have said they will appeal to Montana's Supreme Court. 'I did what I thought was necessary to protect my family,' he said, according to KPAX. Dede, from Hamburg, Germany, was studying at Missoula's Big Sky High School and planned to leave the U.S. after the school term ended a few weeks after the shooting. His parents testified earlier that they were unable to work or plan for the future after their son's death. Also Thursday, McLean rejected a request for a new trial from Kaarma's attorneys. They argued extensive news coverage of the shooting prevented the seating of an impartial jury. The case prompted one Missoula lawmaker to draft legislation that would require violent entry into an occupied structure for the use of force to be justified. Defense lawyers said they planned to appeal the verdict to the Montana Supreme Court, but otherwise made no comment.

"Newly-obtained police reports have shown that Whitney Houston's daughter was involved in a traffic accident that injured two people days before she was hospitalized. Police in Roswell, Georgia, say Bobbi Kristina Brown was driving a Jeep Liberty on January 27 when she lost control, crossed into oncoming traffic and collided with another vehicle. A passenger in the Jeep and the other car's driver were taken to the hospital. Four days later, on January 31, Brown was found unresponsive in her bathtub, and her family said she's been 'fighting for her life' since. Lost control of car: Bobbi Kristina Brown was driving a Jeep Liberty on January 27 when she lost control, crossed into oncoming traffic and collided with another vehicle. She was found unresponsive on January 31. The 21-year-old is seen here in an undated selfie . Support: On Thursday, Bobbi Kristina's grandmother Cissy Houston was seen at Emory University Hospital, where the 21-year-old woman remains in a coma . By her side: Cissy Houston walks out of Emory University Hospital in Atlanta, Georgia, on Thursday . Visiting: Bobbi Kristina's father Bobby Brown visits his daughter on Thursday . Records also show that Brown's partner, Nick Gordon, called police in July 2013 saying she had fallen and was unresponsive. The officer wrote at the time that she was disoriented and went to the hospital. The news of the car crash and the domestic call come after Bobbi Kristina's aunt said she believes Nick Gordon will '110 per cent' be charged with a crime related to Bobbi Kristina's injuries. Leolah Brown, Bobby Brown's sister, said she thinks Brown was involved with Bobbi Kristina being found face-down in a bathtub at the couple's  townhouse over a week ago. No one has been charged in the incident or named as a suspect, and Gordon has not responded to the family's accusations. Bobbi Kristina has been on a ventilator in hospital since she was found, but Leolah Brown insisted she is 'doing good' and has even opened her eyes. Speaking out: Speaking to Fox News, Leolah Brown, Bobbi Kristina's aunt, has said she believes the young woman's boyfriend, Nick Gordon, should be charged in relation to her injuries . 'Fighting for life': Bobbi Kristina, who has been in a medically-induced coma for the last 12 days, was involved in a car crash just four days before she was rushed to hospital unresponsive . 'I saw this coming,' she told Fox 5 Atlanta. 'I told her not to trust anyone.' Gordon was taken in by Houston as a child and brought up as Bobbi Kristina's brother - but after Houston's death, they started a romantic relationship and last year, they claimed they had married. In the Fox interview, Leolah said she does not think Gordon has been a good influence on her niece. 'I have my reasons,' she said, without going into further detail. 'There are a lot of family reasons that have that same reason.' She went on: 'I believe Nick Gordon will be charged with this... I hope that he will be charged with this as well. Soon. I really do.' She added that she had lived with Whitney Houston and Bobby Brown and had helped them look after Bobbi Kristina, but never saw Gordon around the house. 'Signs of improvement': She said that Bobbi Kristina, pictured with Gordon, has opened her eyes and appears to be improving. Gordon has not responded to the family's accusations about his part in the incident . Scene: Gordon and a friend discovered Bobbi Kristina in the bathtub at their home in the neighborhood of Roswell, Georgia, pictured, on January 31. She has been in a medically-induced coma ever since . She also reiterated her brother's statement that the young couple are not married, despite their claims on social media last year, and hinted that they had been through some trouble. 'This is the man Krissi loved but she was a young girl,' she said. 'We stay.' Leolah also dismissed the idea that Bobbi Kristina would have hurt herself. 'Krissi would never do anything to herself,' she said. 'She loved life too much. She had too much going on. She had too much ahead of her.' As for her niece's current condition, she rubbished reports that Bobbi Kristina was brain dead. 'It's been very, very painful for everybody. Mainly Bobby, because that's his baby,' she said of her brother, Bobby Brown. But she added that they remain hopeful, especially because she has given them 'signs' that she'll recover, such as opening her eyes, she said. There is also no truth to the idea that Bobbi Kristina would be removed from life support today - the same day her mother died three years ago - she said. 'No,' she said, adding: 'Bobby's calling the shots.' The family has been at Bobbi Kristina's bedside in Emory University Hospital in Atlanta, where she remains in a medically-induced coma after being found submerged in bathwater. On the scene: Max Lomas, seen in an old mug shot, was the one who found Bobbi Kristina in the bath . No one has been charged or named as a suspect in the January incident. Gordon has not commented publicly about his girlfriend's condition and has not responded to the family's accusations. Earlier this week, RadarOnline reported that bruises were found on Bobbi Kristina's body. Gordon told a friend that he caused them while performing CPR. It has also emerged that one of their neighbors reported a domestic dispute at her address the week before she was found, according to a 911 call made by her security guard on January 23. The caller told a 911 dispatcher that one of the neighbors had reported a fight at the address. They said they saw people 'hitting each other and swinging' outside the three bedroom townhouse. He did not give descriptions of how many people were fighting or who they were . The ongoing investigation and limited details being provided in Miss Brown's case have fueled speculation about her condition and the circumstances that led to her hospitalization. 'We continue to request privacy in this matter,' Bobby Brown said in a statement released through his lawyer, Christopher Brown. 'We thank everyone that supported the vigil for Bobbi Kristina. God is hearing our prayers.'","Car crash in Roswell, Georgia, was on January 27, new police reports show .

"The official album chart will see data online streaming from services such as Spotify and Deezer included for the first time from next month. Data from services including Spotify, Napster and Google Play will be counted in the chart issued on Sunday March 1. Using a convoluted algorithm to prevent wildly popular singles - such as Mark Ronson's 'Uptown Funk', which is being streamed 2million times a week - from spiking the rankings, the move will reflect modern changes in music consumption. Mark Ronson's 'Uptown Funk' single is being streamed 2million times a week . In the last 12 months to January, the number of songs streamed in the UK has doubled to 50 million a day and the singles chart started accepting streaming data in July. But an album does not have to be listened to in its entirety - in fact, a stream that counts towards its ranking needs only to be listened to for 30 seconds, The Independent reported. The Official Charts Company said the change had not been made 'lightly'. Its chief executive, Martin Talbot, said: 'The Official Charts Company's mission is to compile the most accurate, reliable and up-to-date charts around, and in 2015 that means reflecting the popularity of streaming, alongside downloads, vinyl and - still the most popular album format - the CD. 'Initial indications are that the impact on actual chart positions will be modest to begin with, but we expect this to grow as streaming becomes increasingly popular.' The data will be weighted so the charts are not skewed by the performance of one or two huge hits. The Official Charts Company will take the 12 most-streamed tracks from each album and the top two will be down-weighted in line with the average of the next 10. These streams will then be added together, divided by 1,000, and then added to the rest of the album's sales. The Official Albums Chart was first published in Record Mirror 59 years ago - with Frank Sinatra's Songs For Swinging Lovers the first number one.","Official album chart will next month begin using data from online streaming .

"The Senate on Thursday confirmed President Barack Obama's choice to run the Pentagon, handing Ash Carter the unenviable task of steering the military as the United States confronts Islamic State militants, conflict in Ukraine and other worldwide threats. The overwhelming bipartisan vote in the Republican-controlled Senate was 93-5. Carter will replace Chuck Hagel, the former Republican senator who had a rough relationship with Obama's insular group of national security advisers. Carter will be Obama's fourth defense secretary in six years, joining a line of succession that began with Robert Gates and included Leon Panetta and Hagel. In a statement, Obama welcomed the bipartisan vote and Carter's return to the president's national security team. Ash Carter testifies before the Senate Armed Services Committee at his confirmation hearing to become the next Defense Secretary on Capitol Hill in Washington. The Senate confirmed Carter today to be Obama's fourth defense secretary in six years . One of Carter's first tasks will be helping to win support for Obama's call to Congress for new authority to use force against the IS extremists. Republicans and Democrats have reacted negatively to Obama's draft proposal, criticizing both its limitations and vagueness. In endorsing the 60-year-old Carter, Republicans expressed little hope that he would have better success in jelling with Obama's inner circle than Hagel did. The former Republican senator and Vietnam War veteran was often the outsider and he announced in November he was stepping down. The president's relationship with the Pentagon has often been strained. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who backed Carter, said he 'needs to have the courage to speak truth to power — to Congress, yes, but also to his commander in chief.' Sen. John McCain chairman of the Armed Services Committee, alluded to the divide between the White House and Pentagon, saying he had 'sincere hope and, sadly, little confidence that the president who nominated Dr. Carter will empower him to lead and contribute to the fullest extent of his abilities.' While moving ahead on Carter, Senate Republicans delayed a committee vote on Loretta Lynch, Obama's nominee for attorney general. Lawmakers said they had more questions for Lynch, the U.S. attorney for the eastern district of New York who would become the nation's first black female attorney general if confirmed. Democrats complained that Lynch is being held to a double standard compared to other nominees and said her nomination should be approved immediately. Her confirmation is expected after Congress' one-week recess. Carter, former deputy secretary of defense and President Barack Obama talk during a nomination announcement in the Roosevelt Room of the White House in December. Carter, 60, spent more than two years as the Defense Department's No. 2 civilian leader under former Secretary Leon Panetta and then Chuck Hagel, the outgoing Pentagon head . Carter served as the Pentagon's second-ranking official from 2011 to 2013, spent two years previously as the department's technology and weapons-buying chief and was assistant secretary of defense for international security policy during Bill Clinton's administration. He prefers to be called Ash rather than his given name, Ashton. The next Pentagon chief faces a long to-do list for a military looking at reduced budgets and crises worldwide. The Islamic State group has claimed large swaths of Iraq and Syria. Russian-backed separatists threaten Ukraine. The war is winding down in Afghanistan after more than a decade of fighting, but there is widespread debate about whether the residual U.S. force is sufficient to protect gains. At his confirmation hearing last week, McCain told Carter he hoped he would push back on any attempt by the White House to micromanage the Defense Department, or over-centralize U.S. foreign and defense policies. 'I'll be entirely straight and upfront with the president and make my advice as cogent and useful to him in making his decisions as I can,' Carter promised. Carter told the committee he was inclined to support providing defensive lethal aid to Ukrainians battling Russian-backed separatists. He also said he would consider recommending a change of plans for withdrawing all U.S. troops from Afghanistan by the end of 2016 if security conditions worsen. About 10,600 U.S. troops remain in Afghanistan. Carter said 2,106 American service members have lost their lives in Afghanistan. 'Finishing the job there is very important,' he said. Voting against the nomination were Republican Sens. Roy Blunt of Missouri, Mike Crapo and Jim Risch of Idaho, Mark Kirk of Illinois and John Boozman of Arkansas.","The bipartisan vote in the Republican-controlled Senate was 93-5 .

"Channel 4 News presenter Cathy Newman has apologised to a mosque after wrongly claiming she had been 'ushered' out the door by Muslims during a visit. The TV newsreader turned up for the British Muslim Council's 'Visit My Mosque Day' last month, but later took to Twitter claiming she had been told to leave. After CCTV contradicted her claims, she was reprimanded by her bosses and today apologised over the row, vowing to 'take a break' from Twitter. The mosque at the centre of the row accepted the apology but slammed Miss Newman's 'exaggerations' and the 'deafening silence' which followed, saying her actions  'endangered our congregation'. Scroll down for video . Channel 4 newsreader Cathy Newman claimed she was 'ushered out' of a mosque in south London last month - but CCTV later emerged showing her leaving on her own just a few seconds after going inside . Today, Miss Newman admitted the original tweets were 'inappropriate' and said she has written to the mosque . Today she tweeted: 'I have written to South London Islamic Centre and offered my sincere apologies for tweets sent in haste after I visited there in error. 'I accept my tweets were inappropriate and regret the use of the word ""ushered"". 'My language was poorly chosen and has caused a great deal of offence. I deeply regret that this happened. I shall now be taking a break from Twitter.' He tweets came after it emerged she had been rebuked by Channel 4 News editor Ben de Pear over the row. Mr de Pear, who has since visited the Islamic Centre, has also written to those in charge of the mosque saying: 'I have spoken to her [Miss Newman] at length and expressed my disappointment at her actions. 'Her language was poorly chosen and caused your mosque untold and undeserved hurt. This was never her intention and we deeply regret that it happened.' The argument started after the TV journalist arrived at the South London Islamic Centre in Streatham wearing a headscarf. But soon after her arrival, she went onto Twitter claiming she had been 'ushered' out of the door, implying the centre had unfriendly attitudes to Western women. Miss Newman tweeted about the reception she said she received at the mosque, which was later criticised . Miss Newman's original tweets sparked a row about sexism in mosques on Visit My Mosque Day . On the day of the row, Miss Newman later reported receiving a 'warm welcome' from another mosque nearby . It later emerged the mosque was one of many not taking part in the event and she was supposed to be at another location nearby where her camera crew had been waiting. CCTV clips later showed Mrs Newman entering the mosque and start to take off her shoes while having a very brief conversation with a man in the lobby. The man at the mosque gestured several times to the left before she put her shoes back on and leaves alone, walking out through the courtyard, the CCTV showed. Miss Newman spoke to no-one else inside the premises and the entire encounter lasted no more than a few seconds. Shortly after the incident, she was back on the street and told her 78,000 followers: 'Well I just visited Streatham mosque for Visit My Mosque day and was surprised to find myself ushered out of the door. 'I was respectfully dressed, head covering and no shoes, but a man ushered me back on to the street. I said I was there for Visit My Mosque. But it made no difference.' The mosque later reported receiving a torrent of online abuse and two telephone death threats which have been reported to police. Miss Newman, 40, later apologise for the incident and today accepted her tweets were 'inappropriate'. Miss Newman - who has appeared on Channel 4 news for nine years - says she is 'taking a break' from Twitter . A trustee of the South London Islamic Centre today accepted the apology but hit out at Miss Newman, whose tweets he said had 'endangered members of our congregation and tarnished our centre's reputation' He told MailOnline: 'The last few weeks have been some of the toughest in our small Mosque's history. 'After initially standing by her claim that she was ""ushered"" out of our Mosque, CCTV evidence showed no such event took place. 'Then ensued a deafening silence from both Cathy Newman and Channel 4 news after footage from the CCTV emerged. An apology eventually followed, over a week after the tweets.' He added: 'In her apology, Cathy Newman laments her ""poorly"" chosen words which she believes ""caused offence"". We were not offended by her choice of words. We were deeply disappointed that her instinctive reaction to a confusing episode was to assume that she was being mistreated by Muslim men on the account of her gender. 'It was this assumption, exacerbated by the hyperbole in her tweets that caused the maelstrom of abuse and national controversy our centre was subjected to. 'These were not just poorly chosen words - they painted a picture of an incident that never occurred.'","Newsreader visited Islamic centre in south London for community day .
