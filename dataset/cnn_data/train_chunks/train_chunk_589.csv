The 5:2 diet, or Intermittent Fasting (IF) has quickly become the diet-de-jour for those looking to shed pounds after being hailed as a wonder diet by a doctor on BBC2's Horizon. The diet, which advocates eating just 500 calories (600 for men) on two non-consecutive days each week, then normally for the other five, promises weight loss as well as a host of other health benefits. Now followed by celebrities like Miranda Kerr it has become the most popular new diet of the year and so Pizza Express has embraced the idea and launched new dishes that fit in with the lo-cal eating plan. The new Superfood salad contains mozzarella, avocado, pine kernels, cucumber, lentils and fresh basil and contains less than 300 calories . The mini Oddono Raspberry sorbet is a non dairy sweet treat that comes to under 100 calories, and is served in a sweet tea cup . The restaurant chain has extended its existing light ‘Leggera’ range so that those following the diet can still eat at the restaurant on their two ‘starvation’ days. In addition to the Leggera pizzas, which were launched in 2009 and each fall under 500 calories, they have added a Superfood  Salad and a Mini Oddono’s Raspberry Sorbet. The Superfood Salad is made up of baby spinach and seasonal mixed leaves, roasted butternutsquash, beetroot, light baby mozzarella, avocado, pine kernels, cucumber, lentils and fresh basil finished with balsamic syrup and contains less than 300 calories. The Mini Oddono Raspberry sorbet is a non dairy sweet treat that comes to under 100 calories, and the range even contains a low calorie wine which is just 100 calories. The Leggera Pizzas, which have salad in the centre and contain under 500 calories, have been a huge success for the restaurant chain . These low cal options are designed to make eating out when watching your weight easier and Pizza Express have even involved a nutritionist in their meal development. However while the nutritionist provides a sample day meal plan for those on the starvation day she does stress that she does not advocate the diet, saying instead she would recommend a more continuous reduction of calories . Pizza Express say in their email to customers: ‘We know a number of our customers our trying to lose weight at the moment by doing the 5:2 diet plan so we asked our nutritionist, Juliette Kellow, for advice on how you could manage a fasting day if you are out and about. ‘But please remember, this level of calories is not recommended by her or other nutritionists as being suitable for a daily regime, outside of the 5:2 programme. For sensible and healthy weight loss, Juliette would advise having around 1,500 calories a day to help you lose 1lb a week.'","Pizza Express has added two items to its Leggera range .

"The U.S have opted for a 'lily pad' strategy which allows them to have troops just over the boarder from Iraq . Developments have injected uncertainty in the Middle East as the region deals with the Arab Spring and fears of Iran's nuclear programme . By . Tammy Hughes . PUBLISHED: . 07:04 EST, 20 June 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 10:34 EST, 20 June 2012 . The United States is planning a significant military presence of 13,500 troops in Kuwait to give it the flexibility to respond to sudden conflicts in the region. The study by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee examined the U.S. relationship with the six nations of the Gulf Cooperation Council - Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates and Oman - against a fast-moving backdrop. In just the last two days, Saudi . Arabia's ruler named Defense Minister Prince Salman bin Abdul-Aziz as . the country's new crown prince after last week's death of Prince Nayef, . and Kuwait's government suspended parliament for a month over an . internal political feud. U.S. Army soldiers from 1-12, 1st Cavalry Division exiting from Iraq on December 13, 2011. Troops could now return to Kuwait as part of a new strategy . The latest developments inject even more uncertainty as the Middle East deals with the demands of the Arab Spring, the end to U.S. combat operations in Iraq at the end of 2011 and fears of Iran's nuclear programme. 'Home to more than half of the world's oil reserves and over a third of its natural gas, the stability of the Persian Gulf is critical to the global economy,' the report said. 'However, the region faces a myriad of political and security challenges, from the Iranian nuclear program to the threat of terrorism to the political crisis in Bahrain.' The report obtained by The Associated Press in advance of Tuesday's release provided precise numbers on U.S. forces in Kuwait, a presence that Pentagon officials have only acknowledged on condition of anonymity. Currently, there are about 15,000 U.S. forces in Kuwait at Camp Arifjan, Ali Al Salem Air Base and Camp Buehring, giving the United States staging hubs, training ranges and locations to provide logistical support. The report said the number of troops is likely to drop to 13,500. Several members of Congress, most notably Sens. John McCain, R-Ariz., and Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., had pressed for a residual U.S. force to remain in Iraq, but the failure of the two countries to agree on whether American troops should be granted legal immunity scuttled that idea. Instead, officials talked of positioning a strong U.S. force just across the border in Kuwait. The strategy preserves 'lily pad' basing that allows the military to move quickly from one location to the next. As it recalibrates its national security strategy, the United States is drawing down forces in Europe while focusing on other regions, such as the Middle East and Asia. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta has said he envisions about 40,000 troops stationed in the Middle East region after the withdrawal from Iraq. Syria: This picture taken in Homs yesterday shows how the region is still struggling with the demands of the Arab Spring . By comparison, a cut of two Army combat brigades and the withdrawal of two other smaller units will leave about 68,000 troops in Europe. During the 1991 Persian Gulf War, some half a million U.S. forces were in the Middle East region. The United States maintained about 5,000 troops in Kuwait from the end of the Gulf War to March 2003, when U.S. and coalition forces invaded Iraq to topple the regime of Saddam Hussein. The U.S.-led invasion was in response to reports, later discredited, that Iraq was developing weapons of mass destruction. Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman John Kerry, D-Mass., who asked his staff to conduct the study, said in a statement: 'This is a period of historic, but turbulent change in the Middle East. We need to be clear-eyed about what these interests are and how best to promote them. 'This report provides a thoughtful set of recommendations designed to do exactly that.' The 37-page report raises questions about how the United States can leverage its financial aid to force change in the Middle East. Late last year, two Democrats - Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon and Rep. Jim McGovern of Massachusetts - opposed the U.S. sale of spare parts and equipment to Bahrain, arguing that the ruling Sunni monarchy was violating human rights and using excessive force to crack down on protests. The State Department went ahead earlier this year with the sale of some military equipment, saying it was for Bahrain's external defence and support for the U.S. Navy's 5th Fleet, which is based in the country. Bahrain stands as a strategic ally to counter Iran. U.S. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta has said he envisions about 40,000 troops stationed in the Middle East region after the withdrawal from Iraq . The report said the Unites States: 'Should not be quick to rescind security assurances or assistance in response to human rights abuses but should evaluate each case on its own merits. 'U.S. government officials should use these tools to advance human rights through careful diplomacy. 'The United States should make clear that states must not use arms procured from the United States against their own people engaged in peaceful assembly or exploit the U.S. security umbrella as protection for belligerent action against their neighbors.' The report also recommended that the United States promote the development of the Gulf Cooperation Council and the Arab League while strengthening bilateral links to the six countries; seek opportunities for burden-sharing on operations such as missile defense, combat air patrol and maritime security; and push for the integration of Iraq into the Arab fold. The report emphasised that the region is critical as a counterbalance to Iran, whose conventional military includes 350,000 ground forces, 1,800 tanks and more than 300 fighter aircraft. It also has ballistic missiles with the range to target regional allies, including Israel.","The U.S have opted for a 'lily pad' strategy which allows them to have troops just over the boarder from Iraq .

Schaffhausen has admitted to killing . his three daughters - 11-year-old Amara, eight-year-old Sophie and . Cecilia, five, - on July 10 last year, but claims he was not responsible . due to mental illness. Defense attorney John Kucinski said his client became mentally unstable . following his divorce due to depression which was compounded by . the personality disorder involving his dependence on his ex-wife. Scroll down for video . Lawyers for Aaron Schaffhausen claim he was suffering from a mental illness caused by a deep dependency on his ex-wife when he murdered his three young daughters last summer . Kucinski argued that his client committed the crimes to help break his . dependency on Jessica Schaffhausen, adding that the prosecution's . argument that Schaffhausen committed the killings to hurt his ex-wife . did not make sense. The killings, Kucinski told jurors, were in some ways not about people; . they were about the dependency, which stemmed from his childhood . relationships with his parents and later transferred to Jessica . Schaffhausen. ‘This crime is deeply rooted in Aaron's dependency,’ said Kucinski. ‘That's where all this comes from.’ Both sides made closing arguments Tuesday, April 16, in Schaffhausen's insanity trial, reports TwinCities.com. But prosecutor Gary Freyberg countered in his closing statement by . saying there was nothing puzzling or mysterious about the crimes; . Schaffhausen killed his three girls because he was jealous and angry. Horror: Amara Schaffhausen, 11, Sophie Schaffhausen, 8, and Cecilia Schaffhausen, 5, were found dead in their home after their father cut their throats . ‘Please do not be fooled into thinking that just because a father murders his children that he must be insane,’ Freyberg said. ""Angry that his wife left him and wouldn't take him back,"" Freyberg said. Schaffhausen was in control of his actions and made a clear choice, the prosecutor said. ""He chose the satisfaction of revenge over the satisfaction of being a father,"" Freyberg said. Aaron Schaffhausen's fate is now in the hands of a St. Croix County jury. Should the jury find Schaffhausen not responsible for the killings, he . would be committed to a mental health institution, possibly for life. If . found responsible, he will be sentenced to life in prison. Last week Aaron Schaffhausen's aunt had told the court that the killer was 'unplanned by his mom and unwanted by his dad'. Schaffhausen argued that his client committed the crimes to help break his dependency on his ex-wife Jessica . Patricia Fix appeared at the trial along with Schaffhausen's mother, father and prison psychiatrist. Ms Fix also said that the family had a history of depression. His father also testified that Aaron was a difficult baby who did not like to be touched. Roger Schaffhausen testified that his son Aaron was a rebellious and belligerent teen who had some 'run-ins with the law'. The elder Schaffhausen says his son stole a gun, brought it to high school and was expelled. However he admitted that his son became a better person after marrying his wife Jessica and that he liked being a father to his three daughters. Roger Schaffhausen said that when his son's marriage broke down and his estranged wife began seeing someone else then he began to behave strangely and made deeply alarming remarks. According to Fox, Mr Schaffhausen senior said: 'There was one phone call received around . two o'clock in the morning. He was very despondent, depressed. Tragic lives taken too soon: Amara, 11, five-year-old Cecilia and eight-year-old Sophie (left to right) Charged: Aaron Schaffhausen, 34, of Minot, North Dakota, faces three counts of first-degree intentional homicide - each a mandatory life sentence if convicted for stabbing his three daughters to death . 'Sounded . like he was always weeping. That he wanted to do terrible things to . Jess' boyfriend. He wanted to hurt the girls to show how much pain he . was in.' The murder suspect's mother Sue Allen told jurors that her son became extremely depressed when he and his wife Jessica broke up. She said that mental illness was common in other relatives. Ms Fix said that she had been deeply concerned that Schaffhausen was going to harm his daughters when he made phone calls to her. Dr Ralph Baker, a prison psychiatrist, also took the stand. He explained that while Shaffhausen was depressed, he did not appear to have a mental condition that would legally support an insanity defense. Baker says Schaffhausen told him what happened at the house was a 'spur of the moment thing'. Schaffhausen told Baker he tried to help Cecilia find her shoes, and the next thing he knew, he had his hands on her neck and was strangling her before then slitting his three daughters' throats.","Trial to decide if Schaffhausen, 35, was .

A woman who was seriously wounded in the Boston Marathon bombings has made an emotional plea to find an unknown Afghanistan war veteran who stayed by her side during the horrific ordeal. Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick told a news conference on Tuesday that while meeting the injured at Tufts Medical Center he spoke to a young woman called Victoria, a student at North Eastern University. She had sustained a serious shrapnel wound to her leg in the first blast on Monday afternoon and was by her own description, 'completely hysterical'. Scroll down for video . Plea: Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick asked the public to help him find Army Sgt 'Tyler' who helped a seriously injured young woman following the Boston Marathon bomb blasts . Victoria said that she had been carried to a medical tent where she was comforted by a man called Tyler, an oil rig worker.  He managed to calm the young woman over her injuries. A hospital spokeswoman said that Tyler told Victoria: 'You’re going to have a scar, but you’re going to be OK. It’ll be like my scar', according to the Boston Globe. Governor Patrick said it was unclear whether Tyler had been working in the medical tent or, like so many others, simply rushed to help the wounded. The Governor asked for the public's help to track down Tyler as Victoria desperately wanted to thank him personally after he was there for her in the midst of her distress. Anyone with information on 'Tyler' was asked to call 617-725-4000 so that he could be put in touch with Victoria. Help: Medical workers aid injured people near the finish line . Victoria is among 183 injured following the Boston Marathon terror attack including nine children. Among those wounded, 23 people are in a critical condition.

The murder suspect is advertising shirts for $15 on jodiaarias.com, along with her paintings of Californian sunsets, animals and castles in the clouds. Proceeds from the T-shirts will go to a Long Beach women's shelter along with charity Reach Beyond Domestic Violence.

Turning a profit: Arias is selling T-shirts and artwork via her website while she awaits a jury who are deliberating her murder trial . The shirts come in black and white and have the word 'Survivor' written on the front in flowery script. Arias is reportedly making thousands of dollars by selling art that she continues to make from behind bars. eBay has banned her from their site so she is relying on a loyal group of friends running her website where pieces of Arias' artwork are on offer for $3,000. Her mother confirmed last month that the colored pencil drawings made by Arias were being sold through a third party. When asked if the drawings - portraits of unidentified women or dead celebrities like Frank Sinatra and Grace Kelly- were selling, Sandra Arias said: 'Oh yea.' Arias is charged with first-degree murder in the May 2008 death of on-off lover Travis Alexander, who was stabbed multiple times, had his throat slit and was shot in the head at his Mesa, Arizona home. The prosecution claims she planned the attack in a jealous rage but Arias' defense team says it was self-defense. Lucrative: Arias has continued producing art work behind bars as she awaits the outcome of her murder trial over the death of her ex-boyfriend Travis Alexander . The defense team for Arias has alleged that Alexander had grown physically abusive in the months before she killed him, once even choking her into unconsciousness, but she kept seeing him because she was in love. However, there has been no evidence or testimony during the trial to corroborate her stories that Alexander was violent or owned a gun - the weapon she says she used to shoot him. The defense has portrayed Alexander as a cheating womanizer who used Arias for sex and abused her physically and emotionally. Prosecutors have depicted Arias as an obsessed ex-girlfriend who couldn't come to grips with the ending relationship.

Arias' palm print was found in blood at the scene, along with nude photos of her and the victim from the day of the killing. She said she recalls Alexander attacking her in a fury after a day of sex.

But the Chinese division of U.S. potato chip maker Lay's (owner of Walkers Crisps in the UK) is banking on tastes in the People's Republic being far more adventurous.

Others marketed by the global brand - which incidentally also owns Pepsi - include Numb and Spicy Hot Pot, Cheese Lobster, Hot and Sour Fish soup and the comparatively normal sounding Braised Pork. Other firms, not to be outdone, are producing flavours including Kimchi (a Korean dish made of fermented vegetables), Tomato Seafood and even Chicken Wing and Pizza (together, on one crisp).

The West's junk-food giants are no exception and they have come up with a range of adaptations to their popular but generally unhealthy snacks to appeal to the eastern palate. Cultural differences, it has often been noted, do make Chinese tastes seem odd to those of us in the West. But can that explain the apparent gap in the market one manufacturer has found for chicken and pizza wing flavour? Willy Wonker himself would be proud of these concoctions including cheese lobster and kimchi . Tickle your taste buds: Tomato Seafood flavour (left) and pork (right) are just some of the flavours being bought .

Blame for the child obesity crisis has been laid squarely at the door of coffee shops such as Starbucks – and parents who allow youngsters to snack. Plain-speaking health minister Anna Soubry accused coffee chains of tempting children with large syrup-laden coffees topped with marshmallows and cream, followed by an enormous muffin. She warned that young people have no idea how many calories they consume because most outlets do not provide such details on their walls. Frothy coffees and mid-morning muffins have been blamed for fuelling Britain's obesity crisis by health minister Anna Soubry . Miss Soubry, 56, said: ‘I have no . problem with coffee shops, but young people go in and have a large . coffee – not a small one – which has syrup in it. ‘It might have marshmallows on top, . and then perhaps another little dollop of cream, because it is just a . snack, a treat or elevenses. ‘“And by the way”, they say, “I think I’ll have one of those very nice muffins”. They do not know how many calories that is.’ The minister also accused parents of failing to teach their children not to eat between meals. ‘Let us talk about something that did not exist when I was young – the concept of snacking,’ she said. ‘I was positively told not to eat between meals. Ms Soubry warned young people do not know how many calories there are in the 'dollop of cream' on their drinks . ‘If we now look in the real world at . how young people live and at what they feel is acceptable, it includes . going into the many coffee shops that exist.’ Almost a third of children . are currently overweight or even obese – so fat their health is in . danger. Miss Soubry has previously attacked . bakeries for selling cakes and croissants that are too large, and has . called for supermarkets and restaurants to reduce portion sizes. She warned that child obesity not only costs the NHS lots of money, but also costs in ‘human terms’. ‘Many of us who see children who are overweight or obese are upset and . concerned about that, because we know that many of those children will . not only suffer from health issues, but will be bullied,’ she said. The minister added that people of all . ages needed to be better at counting calories but said she did not want . to ‘demonise’ any food. She recalled that the concept of ‘snacking’ simply did not exist when she was young, and that she was told in no uncertain terms by her mother and father that she should only eat at mealtimes. Miss Soubry, the public health minister, made her comments just days after claiming the Prime Minister only gave her the job because she was a woman. She told Total Politics magazine that her position was seen by many as a ‘soft girly’ job, and was concerned that David Cameron had seen fit to give it to ‘the girl again’. Almost a third of children are currently overweight or even obese – so fat their health is in danger. The minister has previously attacked bakeries for selling cakes and croissants which were too large, and has called for supermarkets and restaurants to do more to reduce portion sizes. In the Westminster Hall debate on Wednesday, Miss Soubry said child obesity was such a problem because youngsters were much more likely to eat between meals than those of her own generation. She said the proliferation of coffee shops such as Starbucks, Costa and Caffe Nero on Britain’s high streets were making the problem worse, because they were popular with young people. ‘Let us talk about something that did not exist when I was young—the concept of snacking,’ she said. ‘I was positively told not to eat between meals. If we now look in the real world at how young people live and at what they feel is acceptable, it includes going into the many coffee shops that exist.' The straight-talking minister said that when she was young she was told not to eat between meals . The minister’s attack on coffee stores like Starbucks is just the latest criticism of the company, which has been accused of not paying corporation tax, and refusing to filter out porn from its public wi-fi system – putting children at risk. The firm has since imposed a filter. Miss Soubry warned that not only did child obesity cost the NHS lots of money, it also costs in ‘human terms’. Are coffee shops at fault for Britain's child obesity crisis? ‘Many of us who see children who are overweight or obese are upset and concerned about that, because we know that many of those children will not only suffer from health issues, but will be bullied. ‘Many of them are unhappy that they cannot, as they perceive it, join in the sport or physical activity enjoyed by their friends. There is a real human cost to overweightness and obesity.’ The minister also refused to backtrack on comments made earlier this year – and widely criticised at the time – that it was possible to tell which children were poorer because they tended to be fatter. She said: ‘We know that 12.3 per cent of reception children who are overweight or obese are from the most deprived backgrounds, as opposed to 6.8 per cent who are from the least deprived backgrounds. ‘I do not know why, but we cannot use the word “poor” anymore. By year six, 24.3 per cent of overweight and obese children are from the most deprived backgrounds, compared with 13.7 per cent from the least deprived backgrounds. ‘I hope that those facts speak loudly, and I also hope that everybody takes this away: the reason why I feel this way with such a passion is that if someone comes from a poor, deprived background, they have enough problems as a child, and enough bad things going against them to prevent them from having a great start in life, without the burden of being overweight or obese.’ The minister said people of all ages needed to be much better at counting their calories. ‘It is a surprise to people—even to supposedly intelligent, grown-up people such as ourselves—when they find out the calorific content of foods that we see and perceive as treats and snacks,’ she said. ‘Equally, I want to make it clear that we should never demonise any food. There is nothing wrong with chips, or burgers; what is important is that it is all good food in moderation.’ Miss Soubry, a former presenter of This Morning, is making a career out of courting controversy. Soon after taking office she provoked anger by saying she supported the legalisation of assisted dying.","Anna Soubry says that when she was young she was told not to snack .

Heston Blumenthal's The Fat Duck has been skewered as it drops 20 places in the world's top ten restaurants. The restaurant in Bray, Berkshire, famed for snail porridge and mustard ice cream, has spent most of the past decade in the top five restaurants in the world. However, the 2013 World's 50 Best Restaurants list - billed as the Oscars of the dining world- ranked it at 33. Blumenthal's disappointment at the 20 place drop for The Fat Duck will probably have been lessened by a climb up the rankings for his latest venture, Dinner. The Knightsbridge restaurant that serves historic British food climbed two places to number seven. Spanish restaurant El Celler de Can Roca, which has featured caramelised olives served on a bonsai tree on its menu, has been named the best in the world. The family run restaurant in Girona, north east Spain, toppled Denmark's Noma from its position to claim the title after spending two years as runner-up on the list. The Roca brothers' avant-garde eatery  now heads a top-ten lineup dominated by Spanish cuisine. Scroll down for video and full list of the world's top restaurants . The chef said food at the Fat Duck, in Bray, Berkshire, is 70 per cent better now than it used to be . Dishes that gave the Fat Duck fame: (Clockwise from top left) Snail porridge, which became so well known it was almost Heston's signature dish; Pigeon with Pistachio; radish, ravioli and oyster; and Quail Jelly . Eye off the ball? Heston's Fat Duck restaurant has slipped down the pecking order after being world number one as 'brand Heston' has grown. A number of high-quality dishes with his name - including his Christmas pudding - are sold in Waitrose . It was a bad day for British restaurants as the two Blumenthal establishments made up just three entries from the UK. The Ledbury in London, run by Australian Brett Graham, was the only other British entry on the list at 13. Blumenthal said while he was pleased to see the emergence of new talent, he admitted frustration at the result. A chef who beat a severe food allergy has had his restaurant named as one of the best in the world. British-based Mikael Jonsson (pictured) initially trained as a solicitor because his condition made it impractical to follow his dream of opening a restaurant. The self-taught was unable to cook without injections because of his seafood allergy. But after starting on a new diet the Swedish-born chef overcame eczema and asthma and opened Hedone, in Chiswick, London in 2011. Just 14 months later he was awarded a Michelin star - and now his restaurant has been named the 70th best in the world. The chef told The Times: 'I think there's a point where you are almost part of the furniture. 'It's exciting to see new people coming through. It's frustrating.' He said the food served at The Fat Duck, formally named as the world's best restaurant, is 70 per cent better now. Blumenthal added that the restaurant's three Michelin stars was a more important guide to the restaurant's quality. Positions two and three on this year's list were taken by chef Rene Redzepi's Noma, in Copenhagen, which has famously served moss, lichen and bone marrow, and Massimo Bottura's comparatively low-key Osteria Francescana in Modena, northern Italy. El Celler de Can Roca, run by the three Roca siblings, is well-known for its free-style cooking and has long been hailed for its combination of Catalan dishes and cutting edge techniques. With Joan Roca heading up the kitchen and his brothers Jordi and Josep as head pastry chef and head sommelier respectively, it has built up a reputation as one of Spain's most exciting places to eat. France and America were the two countries with the most restaurants on the list, both notching up six in the top 50. China also had three entries for the first time. The . list was drawn from the votes of more than 900 leading figures in the . industry - including food critics, chefs, restaurateurs and highly . regarded ""gastronomes"". The . World's 50 Best Restaurants Awards, sponsored by S.Pellegrino and Acqua . Panna, were presented at the Guildhall in central London. Early days: Heston Blumenthal in 2002 at the Fat Duck as he presented 'Kitchen Chemistry' on the Discovery Channel where he explained the science of cooking . It was the restaurant that helped propel Heston Blumenthal to culinary stardom. The Fat Duck was voted the best in in the world in 2005 and the set menu now costs diners £195 per person. Blumenthal, who has three Michelin . stars, set the restaurant up with his ex-wife Zanna and the pair turned . it into a multi-million pound business. On the back of its success, . Blumenthal has gone on to become a television star, signing a £1m deal . with Channel 4, as well as signing a lucrative deal to promote . supermarket chain Waitrose. Under his name, the upmarket supermarket have launched some high quality products - including orange-filled Christmas puddings. The desserts were so popular that 18 months ago they were selling for £200 on eBay as stores ran out of them. With such commercial success, it will raise the question that Heston has taken the eye off the ball at his top restaurant. Over the years he has become a familiar face on television as his success in the kitchen has propelled him to national fame. He has published books and set up three other restaurants. With so much on his plate, it's perhaps little surprise the Fat Duck has slipped down the rankings. Eight years after topping the list of the world’s best eateries, the Fat Duck in Bray, Berkshire, last night plummeted down the league table to 33rd place - down from 13th last year. The restaurant, famous for serving unusual astronomic dishes such as snail porridge and egg and bacon ice cream was founded in 1995 and has spent ten years in the top 50 list. However, in 2009 it closed down for two weeks after it suffered from the largest ever recorded norovirus outbreak with over 400 diners falling unwell. Television sports presenter Jim Rosenthal, who was eating at the restaurant with his wife for her 58th birthday, was among the diners to fall ill.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 17:45 EST, 5 May 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 17:45 EST, 5 May 2013 . Many horseriders have taken to wearing bright hi-viz vests with the words 'Police' or 'Please' on the back . With the deaths of four horse riders and more than 100 casualties on the roads in a year, it’s easy to understand why many have taken to wearing high-visibility bibs. But the bright clothing gained them unwanted attention when police warned they could be prosecuted – for impersonating an officer. The Association of Chief Police Officers has written to the British Horse Society criticising the safety gear. The problem appears to be that riders often wear fluorescent jackets with the words POLITE or PLEASE on a black panel, to encourage motorists to give them space. Some sport the reflective blue-and-silver chequered border used on police uniforms. Police responded after motorists complained they were mistaking hobby riders, of which there are about 3million in Britain, for mounted police officers. Assistant chief constable Ron Hanson, the association’s head of mounted policing, wrote: ‘Anyone possessing these products is at risk of breaking the law, namely section 90 of the Police Act 1996.’ In the letter, which has been posted on the BHS website, he said: ‘Over recent months a number of examples of high visibility equine apparel have been brought to my attention. ‘These articles have caused concern to the police on the grounds individuals wearing them are likely to be mistaken for a police officer.’ Jackets in yellow, the colour used by police, those printed with a word resembling POLICE and any using blue-and-silver banding ran the risk of flouting the law, he said. He added: ‘It is apparent that this issue has been subject to considerable debate through equine forums and I wish therefore to clarify the position from the police’s perspective for your readers so that they appreciate the risks associated with wearing such products.’ Assistant chief constable Ron Hanson said that individuals wearing the vests are likely to be mistaken for police (pictured) Mr Hanson has also issued guidance to  manufacturers and police. Nicky Fletcher, director of Equisafety, launched a range of bibs with the word POLITE in 2010. She advised riders to wear them, saying: ‘The law regarding this is so ambiguous as to be confusing, otherwise the new ACPO lead for the mounted police would not have had to interpret the law and issue “new” guidelines.’ She claimed the advice was ‘irresponsible and could certainly cause riders to remove hi- visibility clothing if approached by an officer’. But Fiona Kennedy of V-Bandz said it had withdrawn clothing with the word PLEASE. The Royal Society for the Prevention of  Accidents recorded four road deaths of horse riders in 2011 and 133 accidents with casualties which were investigated by police. The BHS says there are 3,000 accidents involving horses on roads every year.","Police have complained that riders are being mistaken for policemen .

Adorned with beautiful baroque paintings that wouldn't look out of place in the Sistine Chapel, it is little wonder that the Painted Hall at London's Old Royal Naval College has been described as the 'finest dining hall in Europe'. And the stunning splendour of the hall's West Wall and part of its ceiling have been restored to their former glory thanks to the completion of the first restoration work on the artwork for half a century. Work on the section of the historic hall cost £335,000 and several months to complete and was possible thanks to a grant from the Heritage Lottery Fund. The work was part of a project to restore the entire hall which will cost £2.5million and take several years. Restored: The stunning West Wall of the painted Hall at the Old Royal Naval College in Greenwich. Months of work to restore it to its former glory have been completed . Stunning: A woman admires the restoration work on the hall which was originally constructed as a dining hall for the Royal Hospital for Seamen at Greenwich . Majestic: Visitors gather around the restoration work which has cost £335,000 to complete and is part of a wider project to restore the entire Painted Hall . Visitors got their first glimpse at the restored work this week. The Painted Hall was originally designed as a dining hall for the Royal Hospital for Seamen at Greenwich, which came to be known as Greenwich Hospital. The original building was designed by Christopher Wren and built between 1696 and 1712. It was built in the mold of Les Invalides and Chelsea Hospital to house pensioners. Similar to their Chelsea counterparts, Greenwich Hospital's pensioners wore a uniform, but in blue and not red. Wren commissioned artist James Thornhill, who also painted the dome in the architect's masterpiece St Paul's Cathedral, to decorate the dining hall in 1708 and he painstakingly painted it over the next 19 years. He was instructed to include as many references as possible to the importance of the Navy in Britain's fortunes. His outstanding work shows his remarkable skill in the use of trompe l’oeil painting throughout, and makes full use of perspective.

Thornhill himself appears in the bottom right-hand corner with his paintbrushes and palette. Although the composition of this wall was certainly by Thornhill, it was probably painted by his highly skilled assistant Dietrich André. Thornhill was paid just £3 per square metre for his work on the ceiling and £1 per square yard for the walls. But his years of toil did not go unnoticed and Thornhill was awarded a knighthood in 1720. Once the hall was completed it was deemed too grand to act as a dining hall and instead well-to-do visitors were allowed in to look around for a charge of £3 with the pensioners acting as tour guides. The Painted Hall was deemed special enough for Admiral Nelson's body to lay in state their in 1806 and a plaque still marks the spot where his coffin lay. From 1824 until 1936, the Painted Hall housed the National Gallery of naval Art and more than 300 works. From 1939 onwards the room's function finally met its original purpose and it acted as a dining room for the Old Royal Naval College and a venue for important dinners, including the 1946 celebration dinner marking the formation of the United Nations. The last restoration work was carried out in the 1950s when 15 layers of varnish had to be meticulously removed. The latest conservation work was carried out by specialist company Paine & Stewart. Wesley Kerr, chairman of the Heritage Lottery Fund Committee for London, who officially unveiled the conserved west wall and upper ceiling paintings, said: 'The Painted Hall is London’s Sistine Chapel – it is one of the most magnificent rooms in Europe and Thornhill’s work is one of the finest paintings in Britain. 'We are delighted that this first phase of restoration works is now complete, revealing a masterly exposition of historic, royal, naval and London motifs. 'More than a thousand people climbed the scaffold to see the restoration in progress, and we look forward to tens of thousands more visiting Greenwich to view this magnificent attraction in the future.'

Diana and George Beckwith claim that Phyllis Blakesley continued to torment them despite being issued with a 5-year ASBO in 2008 . A pensioner is behind bars after breaching a restraining order by continuing her hate campaign against her neighbours - from 350 miles away. Former tearoom owner Phyllis Blakesley, 79, continued an abuse campaign against former neighbours Diana and George Beckwith despite being issued with a restraining order. Mrs Blakesley was slapped with a five-year ASBO and banned from going within 200 metres of the couple's Cumbria home in 2008. But she continued her hate campaign from her new home in Bognor Regis, West Sussex by bombarding the pair with scores of threatening letters,. Worthing Magistrates Court heard how the former nurse had sent more than 30 letters since February alone, branding the Beckwiths as drug dealers and thieves. Blakesley admitted sending the letters between August and October last year but denied she had an ASBO, claiming her signature on the document was forged. She told magistrates: 'It's all corrupt. No document is authentic. 'They were all in cahoots. It's a malicious prosecution.' Mrs Blakesley claimed the Beckwiths had led a 'witch hunt' to force her out of Cumbria after her court appearance there in 2008. But Melanie Wootten, prosecuting, said there was no evidence the document was forged - an opinion shared by the magistrates. The court heard how Mrs Blakesley, who has nine convictions for 29 offences, was given the ASBO after she breached a series of restraining orders. The orders were given for sending the Beckwiths letters, squirting them with a hose, attacking their cattle with a broom, sabotaging farm machinery and sawing part of a fence. In a victim impact statement read to the court, Mrs Beckwith said she had been left 'distressed and humiliated' by Blakesley's abuse. She said: 'We have suffered harassment for 15 years. She is so abusive. I've felt let down and helpless. 'She is very disturbed, bitter and angry. She has a total disregard for her victims.' Mrs Blakesley admitted sending the letters between August and October last year but denied she had an ASBO, claiming her signature on the document was forged . Doctors previously diagnosed Blakesley with a paranoid personality disorder, which left her with a tendency to be suspicious of other people. She suffered paranoid and irrational delusions, leaving her with conspiracy theories about her neighbours, the local council, the justice system and Freemasons. Mrs Blakesley originally fell out with the Beckwiths over access rights through a gate at her home in Kirkby Stephen, Cumbria, which she bought from the couple.

A bungling bus thief has been jailed after he stole a coach from a depot to pick up his friends - before being tracked down by footprints he'd left in snow. CCTV showed Scott Dowdall, 29, breaking into the vehicle and driving it away in the early hours of March 22. He then drove to the bus station to pick up the group before abandoning it. Officers found the single-decker bus with its alarm going off and hazards flashing at around 4.45am. Stepping out on the town: Scott Dowdall was arrested by police following the drunken rampage after they followed a trail of his footprints in the snow . Dowdall stole the single decker stage coach following a night on the town with friends (File picture - bus similar to the vehicle stolen) They then followed a trail of footsteps left in the fresh snow, running from the vehicle to an address around half a mile away, where Dowdall was found unconscious on a sofa. Police described Dowdall, of Huthwaite, Nottinghamshire, as smelling strongly of alcohol and slurring his words when he was arrested. Prosecutor David Miles told Mansfield Magistrates Court that CCTV footage of the Stagecoach Depot in Mansfield showed Dowdall breaking into the vehicle and driving it away at around 3.15am. CCTV footage from Mansfield Bus Station later showed the vehicle picking up four people who 'appeared to then go to the back of the bus and urinate on the seats', Mr Miles told the court. 'When officers arrived at the bus it was abandoned in the middle of the road with its alarm going off. 'After they had dealt with the alarm, they noticed a set of fresh boot prints in the snow, leading from the vehicle towards some houses. 'They followed the trail to a door of a nearby property and discovered a pair of wet boots outside with a grip that matched the prints. 'Inside they discovered the defendant asleep on the sofa and when asked what he has been doing, he said that he couldn't remember.' Scott Dowdall hijacked a coach from Mansfied bus depot (pictured) in order to ferry his friends home following a night out . Dowdall was then taken to Mansfield Police Station where he refused a breath test because officers would not 'let him have a fag'. He admitted taking a motor vehicle without the owner's consent, failing to provide a specimen and driving while disqualified. He was jailed for four months. Dowdall's passengers were not in court and it is not known at what point they left the vehicle. Following the case, Pc Emma Ashton, of Nottinghamshire Police, said: 'Taking the bus home took on a whole new meaning for this individual. 'Instead of walking or getting a taxi home after his night out, he put his own life, and that of others on the road, in danger, made off with a vehicle and then left it blocking the road. 'It had been heavily snowing that evening and, when attending, officers noticed there were footprints leading from the bus. 'In a great piece of old-fashioned detective work they followed them, found Dowdall there and were able to make an arrest. 'Although no one was injured, this incident could have had a very different outcome.'","Scott Dowdall, 29, jailed for four months after stealing bus .

Lisa Kilbourne-Smith and boyfriend James Davis from Painswick, Glousestershire, were looking after the tiny pet - then called Tink -for friends when they found her lying lifeless in her cage. They thought she was dead and wrapped her body in kitchen roll, dug a grave in their flower bed and gently laid the rodent to rest. The tearful pair then phoned Tink’s owners Nicki Gamble and Jamie Wynn to break the terrible news. Scroll down for video of Tink... 'Tink' shocked Lisa Kilbourne-Smith and boyfriend James Davis by coming back to life 24 hours after she was buried . They Tink it's all over: The spot in Painswick, Gloucestershire where the couple buried the hamster in a kitchen roll only for him to dig his way out again . But the next day - Good Friday - the pair called back to announce that the Houdini hamster who the family have nicknamed 'Jesus' had been ‘resurrected’ after going into hibernation. She had eaten her way out of her paper shroud, dug her way out of her grave, edged along a narrow wall and then climbed a waste pipe to land in a recycling box. She then crawled into an empty cat food cardboard box which became her shelter through the sub-zero night. Lisa Kilbourne-Smith (pictured right) and her father Les (left) couldn't believe their eyes when Tink came back from the dead 24 hours later after escaping from a paper shroud . Tink was found by Ms Kilbourne-Smith's startled father Les the following afternoon as he went to flatten the boxes for recycling and her head suddenly popped out. As well as surviving her burial, the freezing night and being accidentally crushed, the robust rodent also escaped becoming a snack for the family’s pet cat Milo. Ms Kilbourne-Smith, 23, a care home worker, said: “James came home from work and found her lying in the middle of her cage cold and lifeless and he thought she was dead. 'We wrapped her up in a load of kitchen towel and buried her about a foot deep in the back garden so that the cat couldn’t dig her back up again. 'We were looking after her for Nicki and Jamie while they moved house. 'James then rang Jamie to tell him ‘Sorry mate, but your hamster’s passed away’, which wasn’t a very nice thing to have to do. 'The next day he rang him back to say ‘Mate - your hamster’s back alive’ and Jamie thought he was trying to be funny.” Local vet John Auld said that he believes that Tink appeared dead because she was in hibernation. he said: 'It has been known for owners to believe their pets have died when in fact they are only sleeping.' Buried alive: 'Tink' managed to escape from the makeshift coffin created by by the couple before braving a night of sub zero temperature to turn up alive and well hours later . Lisa Kilbourne-Smith is overjoyed that 'Tink'  made a speedy recovery following the mix-up . Les, 60, said: 'It’s amazing that she survived. 'She’d been out in that freezing cold all night - it was a good 24 hours. 'The energy she had to dig herself out of that hole, then get along the wall and climb up into that recycling box was remarkable really. 'I was taking the boxes to the shed to squash them all down for recycling when suddenly a little face popped out of one of them which gave me a big startle I can assure you. 'I brought the box into the house and said to Jim, ‘Have you lost one of your pets?’ 'That was when we discovered that it was Tink and she most definitely wasn’t dead. 'We’ve nicknamed her Jesus because it was Easter when she came back from the dead.” Happy at home: 'Tink' is relaxing after coming back from the dead. Experts believe that the hamster was hibernating . Ms Kilbourne-Smith - who is still caring for Tink - added: “She was in the cat biscuit box that we’d thrown out the night before. 'She’d managed to crawl into the little hole and survive the night in there.' Mr Davis, 24, a binman, said: “I came home and thought she was dead because she’s two-and-a-half years old, which is quite old for a hamster. “When Les found her safe and well in the recycling, I had the embarrassing job of ringing Jamie to tell him ‘She’s not dead, she crawled out of her grave last night.’” Experts said that Tink had gone into hibernation which had made her appear dead. Vet John Auld said: “This isn’t the first instance of a hamster coming back from the dead that I’ve come across. 'If its body temperature drops below a certain level the animal can go into hibernation. 'It has been known for owners to mistakenly believe that their pets have died when in fact they are only sleeping. 'However, I’m amazed by this hamster. The animal’s body temperature would have had to have risen to rouse it from hibernation. 'With the temperatures we experienced over Easter, one would think that the ground would have been far too cold for it to come out of its dormant state.'","Pet originally called 'Tink' buried in kitchen roll in garden .

An inquest recorded a verdict of accidental death after Andy Banks died when he became trapped in a drain on New Years Day . A musician drowned after he became trapped in a drain while trying to retrieve his car keys, an inquest has heard. Andy Banks, 49, died after leaving The Swan pub in Liversedge, West Yorks on New Years Day. An inquest at Kirklees Coroners Court heard how locals called police when they found the popular musician. Fire crews spent 40 minutes attempting to free him before he was pronounced dead at the scene. The court heard how Mr Banks had removed the drain cover and the water level was a foot below the street surface at the time. It is not clear whether he planned to drive or put his belongings in his car before walking to his home in nearby Dewsbury. Deputy Acting Coroner for West Yorkshire Tim Ratcliffe said the evidence suggested he dropped the keys down the drain, lifted the cover off and reached down to fish them out. Pathologist Karen Ramsden said keys were found in his right hand. A post mortem examination found signs consistent with having been drowned. Recording a verdict of accidental death, Mr Ratcliffe said: 'It's reasonable to draw inference on the balance of probabilities that for some reason his keys got down the drain and he was trying to retrieve them. Andy Banks spent the hours before his death entertaining friends at the Swan pub in Liversedge, West Yorks on New Years Day . 'This was in many ways a rather unusual and tragic death.' Mr Banks was a well-known local musician and sculptor who played for a number of local bands. Friend Sharon Brogden said Andy was a sensitive and generous man who had recently opened rehearsal rooms in Dewsbury for bands to practice in. She said: 'That's something he decided to do, because that's the sort of person he was. He was very sensitive and very honest. 'It wasn't his time to go. He had everything going. Everything seemed to be going well.'",Fire fighters spent 40 minutes trying to rescue Andy Banks before he was pronounced dead .

Two sisters helped themselves to jewellery worth £500 - seconds after a bungled armed robbery at a pawnbrokers. Masked raiders fled empty-handed after they smashed holes in the glass counter with a sledgehammer. Sisters Eva Bandova, 55, and Sona Horvathova, 45, who were shopping in the store, waited for them to leave - then reached through the holes and snatched rings. Eva Bandova, 55, and Sona Horvathova, 45, stole £500 of jewellery in 'opportunistic' theft . But their 'stupid' theft was captured on CCTV. It shows the pair cowering in fear - and then just seconds later selecting the rings and calmly walking out. The robbers - wearing crash helmets, masks and gloves - have never been caught. But scheming Bandova and Horvathova were arrested within days, because staff at the shop had their personal details. The Czech-born sisters, who live together on Crescent Road, Cheetham Hill, both admitted theft. The sisters helped themselves to £500 worth of jewellery from the store . They had just completed a silver transaction at H&T pawnbrokers on Cheetham Hill Road in Manchester when the robbers burst inside in January. Bandova, described as a regular customer, is seen on the floor in terror. Horvathova ran out as the robbers smashed the counter. John Werhun, prosecuting at Manchester magistrates court, said staff activated a panic alarm and fled to a back room as the sledgehammer was being used to smash the display cases. He said: 'For whatever reason the robbers decide that enough is enough and leave the store. Despite their efforts, they do not manage to leave with anything. 'It is unambiguous. Both ladies reach a hand into the holes in the counter. Quite why they decided to jump onto the bandwagon I do not know. 'Within a short time , they have seen an . opportunity and hatched this plan between them. It is a fluke. They . obviously do not realise that the CCTV was running. It was a very easy . matter for the staff to give their details to the police and they were . arrested.' Masked raiders attempted a bungled armed robbery moments before the sisters struck . The stolen rings have never been recovered. Suzanne Ludlow, representing Bandova, said the incident displayed a 'lack of judgement and a lapse of control'. She said: 'They were unaware of the CCTV in the shop. Miss Bandova, on sight of her sister placing her hand in one of the cabinets, duly does the same. It was clearly a spur of the moment decision and something which Miss Bandova deeply regrets.' Robert Stewart, for Horvathova, said the case was ""the most opportunistic theft"" he has dealt with. He added: 'It can only be described as a moment of stupidity. They were victims who became offenders.' Bandova was sentenced to a nine-week curfew order, meaning she must stay at home between 7pm and 7am each day. The order will be monitored by an electronic ankle tag. She was also ordered to pay £100 costs and £250 compensation. Horvathova will be sentenced on May 29 after pre-sentence reports are drawn up.","Eva Bandova, 55, and Sona Horvathova, 45, snatched jewellery following bungled armed robbery .

MPs have called for an urgent crackdown on foreign students who abuse the immigration system as figures show barely one in 1,000 suspected cases ends  in deportation. Universities reported a record 106,000 cases of suspected abuse by foreign students last year, following pressure to clamp down on bogus applications from those looking to come to Britain to work. But Home Office figures reveal the UK Border Agency took action over just 658 individuals. Of these, 153 cases – fewer than a quarter – ended in the suspect being deported. The UK Border Agency took action over just 658 individuals, of these only 153 of them were deported . The figures, released under the Freedom of Information Act, suggest just 0.14 per cent of cases lead to deportation. They will fuel criticism of the UKBA, which is set to be broken up following a warning from Home Secretary Theresa May that its performance is ‘not good enough’. James Clappison, a Tory member of the Commons home affairs committee, said the apparently lax enforcement risked undermining Government efforts to crack down on bogus students. Mr Clappison said: ‘It is extremely important that the UK Border Agency take this issue seriously, and thoroughly investigate where there are concerns. Sir Andrew Green of Migration Watch said that the figures showed the scale of the abuse of the British education system . ‘These figures suggest the . performance is nowhere near good enough. On the face of it they are . looking into far too few cases and that is a serious matter because we . can’t afford to have any holes in our system of immigration control.’ Rules introduced in 2009 mean non-EU . students must be sponsored by a licensed college or university, which . must report any concerns to UKBA. In the academic year 2011/12 colleges reported 106,698 warnings to UKBA – up from 77,757 the previous year and 4,795 in the first year of the scheme. Andrew Green, chairman of the think-tank Migration Watch UK, said the figures provided ‘astonishing evidence of the sheer scale of abuse of the British education system by foreign students’. In May last year the UKBA launched Operation Rosehip to deport those who had breached or overstayed their visas. But the latest figures suggest the initiative produced only modest results. A report last year accused UKBA of ignoring tens of thousands of alerts from colleges, potentially allowing huge numbers to remain in the country on false pretences. Of the 190,000 warnings since the system began, more than 70,000 involved reports of a significant change in a student’s circumstances, 52,000 related to the college ending its visa sponsorship of the student, and almost 17,000 said a student had finished or dropped out of their course. Other significant reasons included more than 32,000 reports of students failing to register for their courses on time and more than 1,700 reports students may have breached the conditions of their leave to remain in the UK. Home Office sources yesterday stressed the rules require colleges to report a wide range of concerns, from the serious to the relatively innocuous. They also insisted hundreds of bogus colleges have been shut down in a bid to prevent people using further education as a backdoor route into Britain. Since 2009 more than 800 bogus colleges have been stripped of their licences. A Home Office spokesman said: ‘Our education system is one of the best in the world. ‘We have overhauled the student visa regime to tackle abuse and figures show our changes are having the right effect. More university students are coming here and bogus students are being kept out.’","The UK Border Agency took action over just 658 individuals .

A jobless single mother boasted ‘at least I’m famous’ after being banned from 80 stores because of her serial shoplifting. Jade Underwood, 23, also made neighbours’ lives a misery and verbally abused mothers taking children to a nearby school. Her antics led to a torrent of complaints and to her being officially branded a nuisance when police obtained a Crasbo – a criminal anti-social behaviour order. Foul-mouthed: Jade Underwood waged a war of terror against her community and brought misery to shopkeepers during her shoplifting sprees . A Crasbo differs from an Asbo in that it is imposed after a criminal conviction has been made. The Crasbo bars the mother-of-three from the main shopping street, primary school and supermarkets which she targeted. Bright yellow posters bearing her . grim-faced photo have been put up around the area to encourage residents . to report her to police if she flouts the bans. Classy: Photographs taken from Jade Underwood's Facebook page on which she openly boasted about being banned from 80 shops . But Underwood posted a defiant, . misspelt message on Facebook, saying: ‘Heyy yah dont bring me down, . least am famouse!! Yah all whata leve meh alone.’ Yesterday shopkeepers and neighbours told how the 5ft menace treated shoplifting like a job and blighted their lives. One said she was such a problem that the local branch of Boots in Edgeley, Stockport, stopped putting make-up out on display. Former neighbour John Duggan, 55, said Underwood had ‘absolutely no shame whatsover’. ‘She used to wear tracksuits and looked just like Vicky Pollard from the . TV show [Little Britain],’ he said. ‘She is a little toad, she’s just . horrible. Terror: Jade Underwood (left) was dubbed Vicky Pollard (right) after the character played by Matt Lucas in television series Little Britain . ‘She would openly say to me “I’m going shoplifting today”, she was not ashamed. I couldn’t believe it. ‘She would come back with food mostly, shoplifting was her full-time . job. She didn’t work, she said she was better off on benefits.’ Underwood also used to keep neighbours awake by playing loud music until 5am, said Mr Duggan. She has now been evicted from her tower block flat and moved a few miles to Withington in Manchester. Glynis Barber, who runs CJ Cardcraft . and is in the local traders’ group, said: ‘People don’t realise how . expensive shoplifting can be for the shop. Not just the cost of the . goods but I have installed nine CCTV cameras to make sure every aisle . and the back room is covered. Terror: Posters of Underwood's face and details of the order punishment have been distributed and put up in the area in case she breaches the ban . ‘When I go to Boots for make-up. they’ve stopped putting it out on the shelves and I have to go upstairs for it.’ Javed Faruqh, 55, who runs Alm Newsagents, said Underwood came in daily, stealing goods and racially abusing him. A Boots store was targeted so many times by Underwood staff stopped putting make-up on the shelves to avoid it from being stolen . ‘I had to always ask her to leave,’ he said. ‘She would steal drinks and sweets. ‘She would always come back. It was very frustrating. Hopefully this Crasbo will work.’ Richard Coaton, a governor at . Larkhill Primary School, said: ‘I am just relieved parents and children . will not have to suffer abuse from this person.’ If Underwood breaches the two-year ban imposed by Stockport magistrates, she could face up to five years in jail. The court described her as a . ‘prolific shoplifter’ who ‘on numerous occasions used language and . behaviour that has caused considerable alarm, harassment and  distress . to shop staff’.

A soldier who groomed a 12-year-old girl on Facebook while he was serving in Afghanistan has been jailed. Wayne Redman, a former bomb disposal expert for the Army, told the schoolgirl he was in love with her and would kill himself if they could not be together. He sent her thousands of messages, even continuing his online advances while he was on a tour of duty defusing explosives. The 34-year-old soldier told the girl he wanted to get her pregnant, and groped her under her shirt while they watched a film together. Redman's crimes were uncovered in . December last year when the 12-year-old's mother stumbled upon the sick . messages he had sent her daughter. He . was sent home from Afghanistan, arrested and charged with sexual . activity with a child and two counts of inciting a child to engage in . sexual activity. Redman pleaded guilty to the charges in March, and was yesterday jailed for three years at Peterborough Crown Court. John . Farmer, prosecuting, told the court that in his Facebook messages the . soldier asked the girl about her underwear, said he wanted to have sex . with her and suggested they run away together. 'This is one of the most comprehensive cases of grooming your honour is likely to encounter,' the lawyer said. 'His ambition to have sexual intercourse with her was frustrated by chance when the young girl left her Facebook account unprotected. 'Her mother found it and obviously, very properly, started the chain of events that brings the case here.' Soldier: Redman, left, was on duty in Afghanistan when he sent the explicit messages to the schoolgirl . Among the 270 pages of online conversations presented to the court, Redman was found to have told the girl: 'Oh baby I want to get you pregnant.' Redman was said to have had 'a promising career in the Armed Forces' before he was discharged from the Army on April 19 in the wake of the charges against him. His former captain described him in a letter as being punctual, reliable and trustworthy, with an excellent work ethic. Ben Long, mitigating, told the court Redman accepted 'full responsibility', and had shown remorse, regret and embarrassment. Trial: Redman was jailed for three years by a judge at Peterborough Crown Court yesterday . He said Redman told him: 'I can't believe how stupid I have been.' Mr Long said the soldier had been on the verge of tears every time he had spoken to him and had been suffering from depression and was taking anti-depressants. He added: 'The defendant wishes to make it clear how incredibly sorry he is to all concerned that this ever took place.'

The rare document is also signed by Sir Rex Hunt, the Civil Commissioner on the islands during the conflict, and Major General Sir Julian Thompson, who commanded 3 Commando Brigade. Scroll down for video . Value: The unique document is set to fetch £15,000 at auction. It is signed by Mr Thatcher and Major General Jeremy Moore - who sent the dispatch at the end of the war . Auction: The historic telex sent to Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher to confirm the end of the Falkland's War in 1982 is to go under the hammer next month. Mrs Thatcher is pictured in Whitehall in 1992 next to a famous image of British troops during the conflict . Historic: Richard Westwood-Brookes, historic books specialist at Mullocks Auctioneers, stands over the telex which he says is one of the most important British historical documents of the late 20th Century .

It is accompanied by another sheet which was signed . by other major participants in the war when the telex last went up for auction in 1999. The signatories included Welsh Guard Simon . Weston who suffered horrific burn injuries during the conflict. The sheet was then mounted alongside the telex in the same frame. The telex had been donated on that occasion personally by Mrs Thatcher - who died last month - to raise money for services charities where it was bought by its current owner. Richard Westwood-Brookes, Historical Documents Expert at Shropshire-based Mullocks Auctioneers, where the documents will go under the hammer next month, said: 'This is undoubtedly one of the most important British historical documents of the last quarter of the 20th century. 'It provides bidders with the opportunity to obtain a document which is truly unique. 'There have been various copies of this document offered in the past but this is the original - and as such ranks along some of the most famous dispatches in British military history, including those from the Battles of Waterloo and Trafalgar.'

Foxtons in Brixton, South London, has been the target of local residents worried about high rents and excessive agents' fees. And when activists tried to talk to staff at the branch, they responded by hiring private security guards to keep the demonstrators away. The estate agent opened its branch in Brixton in March. Guarded: Foxtons in Brixton has hired bouncers to keep out protesters who oppose gentrification . It was immediately targeted by vandals, who defaced its windows with messages directed against Foxtons clients. Employees found that abusive graffiti reading 'yuck' and 'yuppies out!' had been painted over the storefront. Last Saturday, campaigners visited three local estate agents to demonstrate against rent hikes and discuss the fees they charge. While one business welcomed the activists, Foxtons responded by posting guards outside the entrance and denying the campaigners entrance. The bouncers said that no one was available to talk to the residents about their concerns. Diverse: Brixton is known for its multi-culturalism but increasingly attracts young professionals; the local market is shown here . The protesters presented a satirical award to the business, dubbing Foxtons 'Brixton's worst letting agent' and accusing them of 'high fees, high rents, cowardly behaviour, and services to gentrification'. 'Despite the dismal state of our economy and the relentless cuts, rents keep rocketing up and letting agents are making things worse,' campaigner Daniel Oldfield told Brixton Blog. 'They often actively advise landlords to put up rents and charge all kinds of fees, most of which have only emerged in the last few years in the so called ""competitive"" marketplace.' Brixton has long been known as a highly multicultural area, having been a major centre of immigration from the Caribbean. Although it was formerly one of London's poorest neighbourhoods, it has received an influx of young professionals in recent years, and new businesses such as cafes, art galleries and delicatessens have sprung up to cater to them. Foxtons is considered a yuppie icon thanks to its modernistic decor, fleet of branded Minis and deliberately informal atmosphere.","Some locals angry at gentrification of diverse area of South London .

After he was orphaned two years ago, scientists did not think a young chimp could survive without help from an adopted parent - and least of all from the alpha male. But that's exactly what happened to 'Oscar', the star of new Disney documentary, Chimpanzee, when he was welcomed in by patriarch 'Freddy'. Having previously shown great aggression over the other males to secure leadership of his chimp colony, Freddy now proved he could also be the daddy of them all. Scroll down for video . Cuddles with daddy: Oscar sleeps inside the protective arms of his adopted father Freddy, as captured in Disney's new documentary, Chimpanzee . Never before have film-makers or scientists witnessed a male taking on the mothering role of a young baby in this way. They watched in amazement as Freddy showed a tenderness towards the young orphan. He allowed tiny Oscar to ride on his back, cracked nuts for him and delicately groomed his fur. Before long, Freddy was sharing his nest with Oscar cradled inside his massive arms. Such an adoption, which is extremely rare, is captured in all its poignancy in the film, which is released in the UK next month. World-renowned primatologist Professor . Christophe Boesch, who has spent more than 30 years studying the . chimpanzees of Taï Forest National Park in Africa's Ivory Coast, where the filming took place, said such behaviour in the animal kingdom was almost unheard of. ‘I’ve never seen a male like Freddy take up the role . of a mother like that,’ he said. Alone: Oscar was orphaned after his mother was killed, possibly by a leopard . Mark Linfield, who co-directed the film with Alastair Fothergill described the touching scenes as 'the best storyline we never wrote'. He said: ‘It was amazing and very touching to see this big, normally gruff male pour his love and devotion into caring for Oscar. ‘It was pretty clear that the story of Oscar and Freddy was going to touch other people as much as it touched us. If we’d scripted it, no one would have believed us. It was the best storyline we never wrote.’ ‘It was very moving to see Oscar’s longing for some  sort of protection and closeness and the tenderness that Freddy showed him. It was very unusual.' The project took 700 days of filming over three-and-a-half years and the crew endured a host of obstacles, including swarms of aggressive bees, torrential rain, extreme humidity and deadly snakes. They at first followed a different chimpanzee mother and baby, but when the crew came across Isha and her newborn Oscar, they knew they had found a special chimp. ‘Almost as soon as he was born, Oscar was bouncing around doing all this look-at-me stuff. He wrote himself into the script. But we had no idea he’d have such an eventful life.’ An older mum with seemingly unlimited patience, Isha nuzzles Oscar with chimpanzee kisses in the film, tucks him up safely at night in a hammock of branches high in the trees, and makes a start on his education. For thousands of years, the chimps of the Taï Forest have used a sophisticated technique to crack their favourite walnut-like cola nuts, handing their unique skill down through generations. Helping hand: Freddy cracks open nuts for the orphaned Oscar . They use tree roots as anvils and carry heavy stone hammers for miles through the forest. ‘One of the funniest things is seeing little ones like Oscar trying to learn, because they keep getting it wrong,’ Linfield says. ‘They miss the nut and hit their foot instead. Or they try with a piece of wood and the wood keeps breaking.’ Heavily reliant on his mother, Oscar will not be weaned until he reaches the age of four and will only become fully independent at the age of ten. But Oscar has only reached the age of three when tragedy strikes - Isha is injured during a territorial fight with a rival band of chimps and never seen again. Father and son: The adoption of Oscar by a dominant male like Freddy surprised scientists . It is presumed she fell prey to leopards in her weakened state, leaving Oscar vulnerable, hungry and left to die - that is until Freddy, the patriarch and alpha-male steps in to become his new parent. Chimpanzee marks the fourth production from Disney's Disneynature division, which was launched in 2008. Following the box office success of Earth, Oceans and African Cats, the film has already taken $30million (£20m) in America alone. Disney has pledged to make a significant donation to the See Chimpanzee, Save Chimpanzees cause, set up by the Jane Goodall Institute, which aims to highlight the plight of these animals. Once numbering more than a million, in just 50 years there are now only 200,000 chimps left in the wild. It is predicted that within 20 years, through hunting, disease and decimation of forests, chimps will become extinct in ten countries. So what next for Oscar and Freddy? Unfortunately, filmgoers won't discover if there is a happy ending to this otherwise Disney-like tale. ‘We don’t know,’ Linfield admits. Freddy is alive and well and has been recently sighted. Oscar, however, . who would now be five years old, has not been seen for some time. ‘Nobody knows where he is. But it’s a big forest, so that’s not unusual. He could be absolutely fine. ‘I hope people will feel chimps are . just like us – with all the trials and tribulations in their lives that . we have in ours. They’re not so very different from us and they deserve . our respect.’ Chimpanzee will be released in cinemas on Friday, 3 May.

The Pentagon has accused China of sponsoring cyber-attacks on U.S government computers as part of a campaign of cyber-espionage. This is the first time the Pentagon's annual report has directly linked such attacks to the Beijing government. The annual Pentagon report claims that at least some attacks on US government and other computer systems appeared to be 'attributable directly' to the Chinese government and military. Scroll down for video . Targeted: The Pentagon, pictured, has accused the Chinese government and military of involvement in the numerous cyber-attacks launched against U.S networks for the first time in its annual report . It alleges China is using its cyber capabilities to collect intelligence against US diplomatic, economic and defence programs, and is developing the skills needed to conduct cyber-warfare. The new wording in the report continues an escalating effort by US officials to call out the Chinese on the cyber-attacks and to press for a more open dialogue with Beijing on the problem. The Pentagon report also criticises a 'lack of transparency' in China's military modernisation programme and defence spending. The report from the US Department of Defense states: 'In 2012, numerous computer systems around the world, including those owned by the US government, continued to be targeted for intrusions, some of which appear to be attributable directly to the Chinese government and military.' China has rebuffed the claims, with its Foreign Ministry repeating that it opposes cyber-attacks as well as 'all groundless accusations and hyping' that could harm prospects for cooperation. Suspicions: A hacking attack on the servers of South Korean broadcasters and banks is believed to have come from North Korea. This shows a row of broken cash machines after the network shutdown . 'We are willing to hold even-tempered and constructive dialogue with the U.S.' about cybercrime, a spokesman said. The issue was highlighted in February with the issuing of a report by cyber-security firm Mandiant that claimed to have traced several years of cyber-attacks against 140 mostly American companies to a Chinese military unit in Shanghai. The firm identified the People's Liberation Army's Shanghai-based Unit 61398 as the most likely driving force behind the attacks. It said says the office block is linked to stolen technology blueprints, manufacturing processes, clinical trial results, pricing documents, negotiation strategies and other secret data from more than 100 companies. More alarmingly, it claimed the unit, known as the Comment Crew, also made incursions into the computer networks that control oil pipelines, power grids, water plants and other pieces of key state infrastructure. Hacked: The New York Times office in Manhattan. The newspaper has reported that its computer system was breached by Chinese hackers . Mandiant executives say attacks . originating in China have continued since then, with the exception of . those from Shanghai-based Unit 61398 that had been highlighted in its . earlier report. Chinese hackers were also accused of being responsible for hacking The Washington Post and The New York Times earlier this year. And just last month, hacking attacks on the servers of South Korean broadcasters and banks originated from an IP address based in China. But China says it is impossible to tell the true origin of cyber-attacks, and accuses hostile forces of blaming it out of prejudice or a desire to put Beijing on the defensive. Senior Col. Wang Xinjun, a People's Liberation Army researcher, described the accusations as 'irresponsible and harmful to the mutual trust' between the two countries. Col. Wang, who is based at the Academy of Military Sciences in Beijing, one of the PLA's main think tanks, told the official Xinhua News Agency: 'The Chinese government and armed forces have never sanctioned hacking activities.'

Al-mubarac refused to say which one out of concern for 'undue publicity.' He says he'll bury Tsarnaev as long as his family can get the body to Denver. Scroll down for videos... Offer: Sheikh Abu-Omar Almubarac who founded the Colorado Muslim Society and the states largest mosque has offered to bury the body of suspected Boston bomber Tamerlan Tsarnaev . Al-mubarac incorporated the Colorado Muslim Society in the late 1960s but made his offer independently of the organization. Al-mubarac says only God can judge Tsarnaev. However, the Colorado Muslim Society issued a statement on Monday night distancing itself from its founder, Al-mubarac. 'It has recently been reported that the Colorado Muslim Society has offered to provide burial services for Tamerlan Tsarnaev, one of the individuals who perpetrated the grave and destructive bombings at the 2013 Boston Marathon. This report is absolutely untrue. The individual who has reportedly made this offer does not speak on behalf of the Colorado Muslim Society,' the statement says. It continues, 'The Colorado Muslim Society strongly condemns all acts of violence and grieves with all of America after the attacks in Boston. The conduct of Tamerlan Tsarnaev is abhorrent and contrary to every principle and belief that underlies the purpose of the Colorado Muslim Society.' The Colorado Muslim Society's general counsel Qusair Mohamedbhai told The Denver Post 'we would never, ever do something like that — offer to bury someone who has committed an extreme act of violence against this country.' Tsarnaev's uncle Ruslan Tsarni, of Montgomery Village, Maryland, has . been unable to bury his nephew in Massachusetts because of protests. The funeral director who currently has the . body of Tamerlan Tsarnaev in his possession has made a plea to the State Department to . help him settle what will happen with the remains. The city of Cambridge, where the . suspected bombers lived prior to the attack, refused to bury the body. Mr . Stefan, whose business in Worcester, Massachusetts has been picketed by . protesters, said that everyone deserves a dignified burial. Decision time: Peter Stefan told a news conference on Monday that a decision had to be reached after the city of Cambridge refused to bury the body of suspected bomber Tamerlan Tsarnaev there . The impasse over 26-year-old Tsarnaev's body came as a local man started a fundraising campaign to have the alleged terrorist's body returned to his family in Russia. William Breault, from Worcester, has kick-started the campaign with $500 to send the body back to Tsarnaev's parents. Mr Stefan said on Monday that he understood the reluctance to deal with the remains following the atrocious attacks last month. However he told NBC: 'Everyone wants him sent back to Russia. I'm gonna get on the phone with the necessary people and say, ''We need help with this.''' The funeral director added: 'It also makes us look bad. In this country, we bury people. We don't leave them hanging around.' Mr Stefan said that he believed that alleged terrorist's family want his body returned to Russia. Tsarnaev's mother Zubeidat Tsarnaeva has repeatedly claimed that her son's were framed for the Boston bombing. A State Department spokesman said that Tsarnaev's family should contact the Russian Consulate for help while Massachusetts Governor Patrick Deval called the burial a 'family issue'. Family: Tsarnaev's uncle Ruslan Tsarni arrived at Mr Stefan's funeral home on Sunday where Tsarnaev awaits burial rites . Determined: Funeral director Peter Stefan accepted the body of Tamerlan Tsarnaev, to give him a 'dignified burial' Cambridge city manager Robert Healy said on Sunday that Tsarnaev's body was not welcomed in one of its cemeteries. 'I . have determined that it is not in the best interest of peace within the . city to execute a cemetery deed for a plot within the Cambridge . Cemetery for the body of Tamerlan Tsarnaev,' Healey said. Tsarnaev's uncle  Ruslan Tsarni visited the funeral home over the weekend to claim his nephew's body. Tsarni chose to step in, he said, . because 'no one wants to associate their names with such evil events' and because religion and tradition call for his nephew to be buried. Every cemetery in Massachusetts has turned down the body of Tsarnaev but Mr Stefan remains insistent that this death be handled like any other. He has also reached out unsuccessfully to cemeteries in New Jersey and Connecticut. Some protesters outside the funeral home believe the bombing suspect should be buried at sea, similar to what was done with the body of Osama bin Laden. Other protestors simply did not want Tsarnaev's remains in their town, like retired firefighter Ronald Wahlers. 'It’s going to give this neighborhood a bad name,' Wahlers, who has lived in Worcester for a year and a half, told the Boston Globe. 'This guy doesn’t belong here.' Watching: Police remained at funeral parlors where the body of Tsarnaev was taken and where protestors followed . Fiona Gilley, left, and her sister Nairi Melkonian, both of Worcester, Mass., hold signs urging compassion while they stand on the other side of the street from protestors on Sunday . Tsarnaev, 26, died from ‘gunshot . wounds of torso and extremities’ and blunt trauma to his head and torso. The certificate lists the time of his death as 1.35am on April 19, four days after the deadly bombing. Tsarnaev died after a gunfight with authorities who had launched a massive manhunt for him and his brother, ethnic Chechens from Russia who came to the U.S. ten years ago. Police have said he ran out of ammunition before his younger brother dragged his body under a vehicle while fleeing. Tsarnaev's family was making arrangements Friday for his funeral as investigators searched the woods near a college attended by 19-year-old Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, who was captured the day after his brother's death. Body: Tsarvaev's body is now at Graham Putnam and Mahoney Funeral Parlors in Worcester, waiting to be buried . The body was released by the state medical examiner on Thursday. It initially was taken to a North Attleborough funeral home, where it was greeted by about 20 protesters, before being taken to Mr Stefan's funeral parlor, which is familiar with Muslim services. Meanwhile, two U.S. officials said Dzhokhar Tsarnaev told interrogators that he and his brother initially considered setting off their bombs on July Fourth. Boston police said they planned to review security procedures for the Independence Day Boston Pops concert and fireworks display, which draws a crowd of more than 500,000 annually and is broadcast to national TV. Authorities plan to look at security procedures for large events held in other cities, notably the New Year's Eve celebration held each year in New York City's Times Square, Massachusetts state police spokesman David Procopio said. Governor Patrick said everything possible will be done to assure a safe event. As part of the bombing investigation, federal, state and local authorities have been searching the woods near the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth campus, where Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was a student. Christina DiIorio-Sterling, a spokeswoman for U.S. Attorney Carmen Ortiz, could not say what investigators were looking for but said residents should know there is no threat to public safety. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, who was found . hiding in a tarp-covered boat in a backyard in Watertown, a Boston . suburb, faces a charge of using a weapon of mass destruction to kill. Three of his college classmates were arrested Wednesday and accused of . helping after the bombing to remove a laptop and backpack from his . dormitory room before the FBI searched it. The . April 15 bombing, which used pressure cookers packed with explosives, . nails, ball bearings and metal shards, killed three people and injured . more than 260 others near the marathon's finish line. Angry: Dozens of protestors have begun picketing Stefan's business, like Scott Schaeffer-Duffy, pictured, who crossed the Boston marathon finish line minutes before the bombs detonated . The brothers decided to carry out the attack before Independence Day when they finished assembling the bombs, the surviving suspect told interrogators after he was arrested, according to two U.S. officials briefed on the investigation. Investigators believe some of the explosives used in the attack were assembled in Tamerlan Tsarnaev's home, though there may have been some assembly elsewhere, one of the officials said. It does not appear that the brothers ever had big, definitive plans, the official said. The brothers' mother insists the allegations against them are lies. Meanwhile, the Department of Homeland Security ordered border agents to immediately begin verifying that every international student who arrives in the U.S. has a valid student visa, according to an internal memorandum obtained on Friday. The new procedure is the government's first security change directly related to the Boston bombings. The order from a senior official at U.S. Customs and Border Protection, David J. Murphy, was circulated on Thursday and came one day after the Obama administration acknowledged that one of the students accused of hiding evidence, Azamat Tazhayakov, of Kazakhstan, was allowed to return to the U.S. in January without a valid student visa. Tazhayakov's lawyer has said he had nothing to do with the bombing and was shocked by it .

Death row: Willie Jerome Manning will be executed  tonight for the murders of two Mississippi students, but the . FBI has now cast doubt on his conviction . A death row inmate is set for execution tonight even after the FBI admitted that expert evidence given during his 1994 murder trial pushed the limits of science and were 'invalid'. Willie Jerome Manning, 44, was convicted and sentenced to die by lethal injection for shooting dead two Mississippi State University students in 1992. His sentence is due to be carried out at the Mississippi State Penitentiary at Parchman, Sunflower, tonight at 6pm local time, after 19 years on death row. If carried out, it will be the first execution in Mississippi this year. But in letters last week to state officials, the FBI and Department of Justice said an FBI examiner had overstated conclusions about a hair found in the car of one of the victims by suggesting it came from an African American. Manning is black and the two victims, Tiffany Miller, 22, and Jon Steckler, 19, were white. The hair sample was the only physical evidence linking Manning to the crime scene. He has always maintained his innocence. 'We have determined that the microscopic hair comparison analysis testimony or laboratory report presented in this case included statements that exceeded the limits of science and was, therefore, invalid,' federal authorities said. Manning's lawyers have asked the Mississippi Supreme Court to halt his lethal injection in light of the revelations, and the Mississippi Innocence Project filed a lawsuit to preserve the hair and other evidence for DNA testing even if Manning is executed. The state Supreme Court refused Manning's earlier requests to delay the execution to allow for DNA testing. Mississippi Attorney General Jim Hood accused Manning of waiting until the last minute to raise 'this frivolous issue.' 'The Mississippi Supreme Court has held that the evidence is so overwhelming as to Manning's guilt,' said Mr Hood. 'Even if technologies were available to determine the source of the hair, to indicate someone other than Manning, it would not negate other evidence that shows his guilt.' 'Frivolous': Mississippi Attorney General Jim . Hood accused Manning of waiting until the last minute to raise the issue . and said other evidence in the case conclusively proves that he's . guilty of the double murder . According to prosecutors, Manning crossed paths with Miss Miller and Mr Steckler when the couple unwittingly interrupted him stealing items from a car outside a fraternity house they were leaving in December 1992. Manning had a history of theft and other charges and had recently been paroled, prosecutors said. Manning forced the couple into Miss Miller's car, robbed them and shot them, prosecutors said. Their bodies were discovered on a rural road near the university campus in Starkville. Prison: Manning's sentence is due to be carried out at the Mississippi State Penitentiary at Parchman, Sunflower, tonight at 6pm local time. If carried out, it will be the first execution in Mississippi this year . Manning was arrested after he tried to sell some items belonging to the victims. He also was convicted and given death sentences for the murders of Emmoline Jimmerson, 90, and Alberta Jordan, 60, whose throats were slashed during a robbery at their Starkville apartment a month after the two students' deaths. That case remains on appeal. Miss Miller's mother, Pamela Cole, said Manning's death would bring her peace but no closure. 'It's just 21 years late,' she said. 'Not a day goes by that I realise what I would have missed, all because of this one joker that decided he was going to play God one night.'","Willie Jerome Manning has spent 19 years on death row for double murder .

A Spanish scientist says he has discovered a female chimpanzee who is addicted to watching porn. Gina, a resident of Seville Zoo, chose to solely watch adult entertainment channels when a television and remote control was placed in her enclosure. Primatologist Pablo Herreros, writing in Spanish newspaper El Mundo at the weekend, told how he made the discovery some years ago on a tour of the nation's chimpanzee enclosures. Porn addict: Gina the chimpanzee (not pictured) favoured the adult channels on her TV over all others. Stock image . During his research trip, dubbed the 'chimpatour', he conducted surveys on the behaviour of the animals. 'What I could never imagine were the surprises prepared for me by a female of this species called Gina who lived in Seville Zoo,' he said. Her enclosure, he said, consisted of an outdoor area where she could play and a heated interior zone where she could protect herself from the winter cold and extreme summer heat. 'Due to the intense interior lives that these animals have, you have to enrich their environment to stimulate them physically and psychologically,' he wrote. 'These usually consist of artificial mounds, toys and other inventions that require them to be active and sharpen their wits. It is the equivalent of occupational therapy for humans.' Chimpanzees and their close evolutionary relatives bonobos are the closest cousins to humans in the animal kingdom. Bonobos in particular are known for their aggressive sexual behaviour, but no-one could predict how Gina the chimp would respond to a television with access to adult channels. Professor Herreros said: 'To enliven Gina's nights, officials decided to install a television, protected behind glass, and gave her a remote control so she could change the channels herself. 'In the early trials, her keepers visited Gina to check that everything was in order and she did not break the new toy. 'The surprise came when they found that within a few days, Gina was not only using the remote control perfectly well, but that she also chose the porn channel for entertainment, as many of us would have done.' Professor Herreros said that easy access to those kind on images on television was 'a very recent phenomenon in human sexual history'. He added: 'Although a small study estimated that porn films are only watched for about 12 minutes on average, the truth is that human and non-human primates possess an intense sexual life. 'This is probably the result of an infinite capacity to dream and recreate the situation in the mind, as evidenced by the games, innovations and manipulations that we are capable of in other areas of our lives.'",Seville Zoo chimp Gina chose solely to watch adult entertainment channels when a digital TV was placed in her enclosure .

"By . Emily Allen . UPDATED: . 06:01 EST, 6 December 2011 . Thugs who dumped huge chunks of concrete on to passing cars could be linked to 30 separate incidents on the same stretch of road police have revealed. Officers said they were looking into a string of attacks on the A12 near Brentwood, Essex, in the past two years, including one in 2008 where a bucket-shaped piece of concrete smashed through the roof of a Landrover Discovery after it was dropped from  Fryerning Bridge near Ingatestone. Three teenage boys from Chelmsford were . arrested and eliminated in 2009 but Detective . Chief Inspector Keith Davies from Essex Police said he would be . speaking to them again as part of an investigation into two attacks last week. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Scene: The attackers threw the rock from this bridge in Ingatestone onto Miss Horne's car. Police are now investigating 30 other incidents since 2008 . Last Thursday, a 1ft-wide slab of concrete was hurled from the same bridge on to Lisa . Horne's car and 40 minutes later a similar attack happened three miles . away which left a woman fighting for her life. Both incidents are being treated as attempted murder. Mr Davies confirmed officers had pinpointed 30 similar incidents since 2008. He told the Daily Mirror: 'It would be foolish . to not consider that these latest incidents are in some way linked to . some of the attacks in 2008. 'They are similar because of both the bridge used and the type of missile.' Lucky: Lisa Horne, left, with her mother Stella who was also in the car with her when it was hit by a concrete block. Both women astonishingly escaped uninjured . The . block landed on the back seat of the 51-year-old David Ackland's Discovery where his . grandfather usually sat. No one was charged over . the incident, but it caused £5,000 of damage. At the time, Mr Ackland, from Romford, Essex, accused the police being 'flippant' in their investigation. This week officers were examining clues from a . forensic examination of both bridges. The force has increased patrols in the area and is appealing for information from the public. David Ackland's discovery had £5,000 of damage when a bucket-shaped piece of concrete, left, smashed through the roof, right in 2008. Fortunately no one was injured but no one was charged for the incident either . Mr Davies said: 'Even a stone thrown from a bridge . can be fatal, but when you look at the size of this concrete, it is . amazing that the consequences were not far, far worse.’ Yesterday, Miss Horne told how she felt lucky to be alive following Thursday's ordeal. The 26-year-old was on the A12 heading home after Christmas shopping with her mother when the block slammed into her bonnet and shattered the windscreen. Weapon: This is the 1ft x 1ft rock which hit Lisa Horne's Vauxhall Astra when it was thrown from Fryerning Bridge near Ingatestone . Damaged: This is the Vauxhall Astra at the roadside after it was hit by the rock while travelling at 55mph. It damaged the bonnet and shattered the top of the windscreen but did not penetrate it so Lisa and Stella escaped uninjured . Speaking for the first time yesterday the mother-of-two said: ‘I was . very lucky to have walked away from it. If I had been travelling 1mph . faster it might have come straight through the windscreen and things . would have ended differently. ‘The police are right to describe it as attempted murder.’ She added: ‘I can’t understand how anybody could do something like that. They need to be caught to prevent it happening again. 'I . was running low on petrol so I wasn’t driving very fast. 'It was as if someone had put their hands over my eyes and I heard a bang and my windscreen just shattered. Second attack: The interior of the Nissan which was hit by a second concrete block last Thursday on the same stretch of road. A 57-year-old woman is still in hospital after that attack . Smashed: The full extent of the damage to the Nissan car and shattered windscreen can be seen here. Police are treating both attacks as attempted murder . 'It . was the loudest bang I’ve ever heard. I swerved across the road and . luckily I had my mum in the car. She said “Lisa get over to the hard . shoulder”. 'I couldn’t work out what had come off the bridge. A few cars went past and hit it.' Miss Horne went on: 'The policeman who was . there said ""You’re very lucky to have walked out of this"". Somebody was . looking down on us that night. 'I’m scared it’s going to happen to someone else and I want them caught. I certainly won’t be driving in the dark.' Heavy weight: The bucket-sized piece of concrete dropped from the A12 bridge . Mindless: The concrete block was flung from West Hanningfield Bridge pictured . She . said: 'I cannot understand why someone would do that. I just cannot . understand they are just not normal people to do something like that. 'It is not fair, you could have taken peoples' lives away and left my children without a mum.' Her mother Stella told the press conference that she could not understand the mentality of the thugs who hurled the rock. 'I just don't know how they went home that night and slept,' she said. 'They could have killed four people within half an hour. 'I just don't understand how people could do that. I cannot sleep thinking about it.' Scene of attack: Police on West Hanningfield Bridge over the A12, where the second concrete block was thrown onto a Nissan car . Appeal: Police and press at West Hanningfield Bridge in Essex after the second attack last Thursday. Police are calling on witnesses with any information to come forward . The second attack, less than three . miles away, left a 57-year-old passenger from Harold Hill, east London fighting for her life with head . and chest injuries. She is now stable in hospital. Essex Police said the block, which . smashed through the windscreen of her and her husband's Nissan from West Hanningfield bridge, near Galleywood, may have been used as a bollard at a . nearby house. On Sunday evening, the road was closed again after someone thought they saw someone throwing a block from a nearby bridge. Danger area: The red pin at Ingatestone is the scene of the first attack . and the second red pin is the bridge at West Hanningfield. The blue pin . indicates where a suspected attacker was seen on Sunday but this has . now been discounted . However, after finding nothing suspicious during a search of the area, police later reopened the road. A spokesman from Essex Police said: 'This was a genuine report and we would encourage such calls. 'We . are sorry for the disruption. But motorists and the surrounding . communities understand that safety is of paramount importance as is . catching the perpetrators behind these attacks.' Meanwhile, police in Shrewsbury . launched an investigation after concrete blocks were dropped from a . bridge on to a road in the town. A West Mercia Police spokesman said: . ‘Fortunately, no one was hurt.’ Terrified: Lisa Horne and her mother Stella fear that if they had been travelling faster than 55mph on the dark road they could have been seriously injured.

Ronnie was so crippled when he was handed over to vets that he was close to being put down, but has now been nursed back to health and can move around again. The dog was rescued from an apparently abusive owner when he was four months old, and was completely unable to walk. Unorthodox: Ronnie the bulldog is taken for a walk in a water tank to help his rehabilitation . The tendons in his front legs had not grown properly because of the terrible diet he was fed, and the American bulldog could only crawl around in constant pain. Staff at Croeso Veterinary Hospital in Cardiff fell in love with the striking-looking puppy, and decided to rule out putting him down. 'He looked totally sad,' said vet Penny Francais. 'He would just look at us as if to say, ""Help me."" 'We thought he would never come back from this, but look at him now.' Experts turned to unorthodox techniques to help Ronnie overcome his rare condition, which is called Carpal Flexural Limb Deformity. Standing proud: The puppy is recovering from a devastating leg condition caused by a poor diet . Therapy: As well as the underwater treadmill, Ronnie practices dog yoga and undergoes acupuncture . He was fitted with splints which support his walking, and put on a rehabilitation programme including dog yoga which stretches out his tendons and strengthens his legs. The dog is also given water therapy, which sees him put in a life jacket and placed on an underwater treadmill. This allows him to take the weight off his legs and walk in greater freedom. After his workout, Ronnie undergoes 20 minutes of acupuncture which is supposed to relax his muscles and stimulate the bloodflow. Happy: The puppy hanging out with vet Tamsin O'Brien from Croeso Veterinary Hospital in Cardiff . Just three weeks after he began the intensive programme, the dog is already able to place his front feet normally. Staff hope that in 18 months, once his bones have fully formed, he will no longer need the splints to walk. Not only has Ronnie recovered his health, he has also found a new home after Croeso nurse Abigail John decided to adopt the puppy. 'We definitely made the right choice,' the 25-year-old said. 'We just want him to have a normal life. We want him to be comfortable and pain free.'","Ronnie's poor diet meant his tendons did not grow and he could only crawl .

A three-time liver transplant recipient is finally healthy enough to realise her dream of modelling as she has reached the Miss England regional finals. Kate Trevener, from Castle Bromwich in the West Midlands, will be taking to the stage to compete in the final of Miss Birmingham on Sunday. The brave 20-year-old has overcome more than any other contestant at the beauty contest, enduring three liver transplants. If Kate is crowned Miss Birmingham on Sunday, she says she will use it as an opportunity to raise awareness about the importance of donating your organs . Kate, aged 16, before her liver problems began. She is now feeling better than ever after her three liver transplants and is hoping to impress the judges at this weekend's Miss Birmingham finals . Kate was rushed to hospital in October . 2010 after she collapsed at home. Despite never having drunk alcohol, . she was told she had the liver of a chronic alcoholic and would die . without a transplant. And if that was not enough, the private Cessna plane carrying the first donated organ from Northern Ireland crashed in thick fog at Birmingham Airport in November 2010. Amazingly, rescue workers found the organ in 'pristine' condition packed inside the charred red ice box. Kate was hours from death at the time but her life was saved by fireman Nick Jordan who freed the pilot from the smouldering cockpit before returning for the organ. The container was strapped to a motorbike and police closed major roads during rush hour as it was raced to the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham. And just 45 minutes after the plane crashed, the liver was successfully transplanted into Kate. Kate will take to the catwalk in front of judges at The Crescent Theatre, Birmingham, with one thought in mind. Kate's first liver transplant made headlines in 2010 after the plane carrying her new liver crashed. Amazingly the liver survived the crash and was transplanted into the hopeful model 45 minutes later . Kate was desperately ill before she received her third liver transplant last year. Her body had rejected two other livers but now she is feeling well enough to pursue a career in modelling. She said: 'I'm going out to experience the new life I've been given.' Until recently Kate believed a career in modelling was beyond her reach. Her body twice rejected transplanted livers and there was an agonising wait for a third organ. But just over a year after her last operation, Kate is finally able can again live a normal life. Bright future: Kate is looking for ward to the Miss Birmingham finals on Sunday but she admits she is feeling very nervous . Kate thought taking part in Miss Birmingham would 'be a giggle' and was surprised when she made the finals . 'We didn't think there would be a life for me,' she said, 'But my health is the best it has ever been. I've had no hospital admissions and my blood is fine.' Cheering her on at this weekend's final will be proud parents Tracey and Michael. Three-year-old sister Annabel is too young to attend, but is already boasting: 'I'm going to be a princess.' Kate added: 'I saw an advert for the competition and said, ""That would be a giggle"". Before I fell ill, I wanted to go into modelling, but my confidence went down.' Supportive: Kate Trevener is pictured with her little sister Annabel and her parents Tracey and Mike shortly after her first liver transplant in 2010 . She was selected for the final after attending a heat at The Burlington Hotel. 'I was surprised they got back to me,' she admitted. 'It's exciting, but I'm very nervous.' If crowned, Kate will use her year as the face of Birmingham to hammer home the importance of becoming an organ donor. 'The bottom line is if I'd not had a transplant I wouldn't be where I am now. Organ donation has been a taboo subject, but if people can see it as an important issue that would be brilliant.' Former fashion student Kate has dedicated her 'new life' to campaigning for more donors and runs a blog called Right Let's Talk Transplants! on the topic. She also hopes to work in the bridal industry. Sunday's winner will walk away with a clutch of prizes and a place in the Miss England final.","Kate Trevener, 20, will be competing in Miss Birmingham finals on Sunday .

"By . Chris Parsons . UPDATED: . 20:53 EST, 9 December 2011 . Over 1,000 rare relics from the Third Reich are going under the hammer in one of the biggest ever auctions of Nazi war items. Macabre items including a love letter written to Joseph Goebbels, Hitler's secret accounts book and even the Nazi leader's personal desk are all part of the huge sale in Stamford, Connecticut. Top of the lots was the ceremonial brass desk belonging to Hitler which the Nazi leader used at the signing of the Munich Pact, which preceded the Second World War. Relic: Adolf Hitler's desk, on which he signed the Munich Pact, sold for $423,000 . The brass ceremonial desk includes ink wells and the Nazi crest with an eagle and swastika . The brass desk set, with an inscribed 'AH', was said to have been designed by Hitler himself, according to auctioneers . The desk, which is inscribed with 'AH' and includes ink wells and the Nazi crest of an eagle and swastika, fetched $423,000 today, according to the auction house. Auctioneers say the two-day sale of Third Reich items reflects a boom in the Nazi relic trade, which has been expanding the more the Second World War fades into history. Other items in the extensive collection range from a photo from a Hitler Youth rally signed by Nazi leader Arthur Axmann, which is set to fetch $200, to Joseph Goebbel's handwritten love letters, which could fetch $9,000. Insight: An incredible collection of love letters written by Jewish schoolteacher Esle Janke to Nazi Minister of Propaganda Joseph Goebbels is also included in the lot . Signed: Letters written by Hitler one while he was incarcerated at Landsberg Prison for his participation in the abortive 'Beer Hall Putsch', the second written three weeks after his release, are also part of the huge collection . Revealing: Another page of love letters exchanged between Goebbels and the Jewish teacher reveal how the Nazi leader lost interest in her when he discovered her roots. On the right, another Hitler letter is displayed . The September 30, 1938 agreement which appeased Germany's ambitions to extend its borders allowed it to take over Sudetenland in Czechoslovakia, a region where ethnic Germans lived. The vain hope was that it would curb the nation's thirst for expansion. The signing of the Pact saw British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain fly to Germany where he attempted to negotiate alongside French premier Édouard Daladier and Hitler's ally the Italian leader Benito Mussolini. The appeasement deal saw Chamberlain announce ‘peace in our time’ on his return yet war broke out a year later as Hitler continued his plans for German dominance of Europe. Bill Panagopulos, President of the Stamford Alexander Auction House, said: 'People want souvenirs – I would even sell Hitler's moustache. 'For all intents and purposes the piece is sold for $423,000.' Andreas Kornfeld, also with the auctioneers, said the buyer of the desk was a private U.S. west coast collector. Buyers at the Nazi auction range from . nouveau riche Russians and private historians to wealthy Jewish bidders . who purchase historically important memorabilia for museums. 'We don't get neo-Nazis – they have neither the brains nor the money,' The . Munich Pact ceded the Sudetenland, a heavily ethnic-German part of . Czechoslovakia, to Germany and was meant to appease Hitler's . expansionist ambitions. However, the pact served to encourage Hitler, leading to Germany's invasion of Poland and the triggering of World War II. Memorabilia: A school journal belonging to Nazi Minister of Propaganda Joseph Goebbels contains notes written as a schoolboy about his classes and teachers . Boom: Auctioneers say they have seen a rise in people demanding Nazi relics, such as this signed photo of Adolf Hitler outside Landsberg Prison . Portrait: A 9 x 11' profile shot of Hitler is . another item on sale in the macabre display, along with the class . journal belonging to Joseph Goebbels from when he was a schoolboy, right .","Also in collection are love letters to Goebbels and Hitler's accounts book .

A private hospital has stopped all surgery on children after a damning report said patients’ lives were being put at risk. The unpublished report from the health watchdog said children admitted for surgery at the hospital in Guildford, Surrey, were ‘particularly at risk of unsafe and inappropriate care and treatment’. It follows inspections in January at the hospital, run by BMI, one of Britain’s biggest private healthcare groups, in response to concerns raised with the Care Quality Commission. The report into Mount Alvernia hospital, Guildford, found children were 'particularly at risk of unsafe care' The report into Mount Alvernia hospital was due to be published yesterday but has been delayed, according to the CQC. It states categorically that patients’ lives were at risk at the luxury 76-bed hospital, where every room is en-suite. It reads: ‘The care and treatment provided to patients at BMI Mount Alvernia hospital was unsafe. ‘People were put at significant risk of harm to a life-threatening level. Children admitted for surgery were particularly at risk of unsafe and inappropriate care.’ Inspectors had several serious concerns, including occasions when surgery was unsafe and staff being told not to resuscitate some patients when their condition deteriorated, even though there had been no discussion with the patient or relatives. It also says communication in the hospital was poor. One patient was transferred from an NHS hospital by his consultant ‘when the patient was acutely unwell’. But the patient was not then reviewed by the consultant who admitted him to Mount Alvernia, and deteriorated. There was no communication with the previous consultant. When the patient’s condition worsened the consultant told staff not to resuscitate, even though there had been no discussion with the patient or relatives as to their wishes. Concerns were also raised by an incident where surgery was carried out in an area without the correct system for ventilation and the disposing of gases used in anaesthesia. The report says: ‘The unit was therefore unsuitable for undertaking any procedures under general anaesthetic and the lack of theatre-standard ventilation posed a danger of infection to patients undergoing anything but very minor surgery.’ Inspectors considered this a particular danger to children. Inspectors raised concerns about unsafe surgery and staff being told not to resuscitate some patients even thought their relatives had not been informed (file picture) BMI Healthcare is one of the biggest providers of private healthcare in the UK and earned more than £200million from the NHS in 2011. The report, when published, may raise questions about the Government’s encouragement of more private sector involvement in the NHS. BMI Healthcare has written to patients to apologise. Chief executive Stephen Collier said: ‘I would like to go on record to state that the failings at Mount Alvernia during 2012 were entirely unacceptable.’ A spokesman for the CQC said: ‘BMI agreed to voluntarily suspend children’s surgical admissions at the hospital and to start making other changes required. ‘We have continued to monitor the hospital closely. Full details of our inspection will be published shortly.’","Mount Alvernia hospital accused of 'inappropriate care and treatment'

The mother of IVF triplets hailed as 'miracle babies' has spoken of her joy after all three survived even though two were born eight days after the first at just 26 weeks. Sarita Saltmarsh and her husband Colin from Sydney, Australia, have spent £20,000 on fertility treatment because the couple were keen to have children after meeting in 2008. Their first daughter, Yasmin, was born suddenly at home on February 28. Within minutes of the first birth, four ambulances arrived . outside - one for each triplet and one for the mother. New mother Sarita Saltmarsh (left) gave birth to triplets eight days apart. Here she is pictured with husband Colin, daughter Zarine( left) and son Suntaj (right). Firstborn Yasmin remains in intensive care . But to the paramedics' astonishment, the remaining two babies stayed inside Mrs Saltmarsh. It took a over a week for them to be born. After the birth of Yasmin, Mrs Saltmarsh was admitted to hospital and eight days later, after a second natural labour, she gave birth to Yasmin's brother, Suntaj, and sister Zarine, around 20 minutes apart. Mrs Saltmarsh had to have all three placentas removed manually, battled an infection and lost a significant amount of blood. Medical experts say the double labour phenomenon is so rare that many obstetricians are not even aware it can happen. Most multiple births come within half an hour of each other if delivered naturally, or just one to two minutes apart if they are caesarean. Baby Yasmin (centre) was the first of the triplets to be born and she remains in intensive care at hospital. Husband Colin (right) was forced to help wife Sarita (left) to give birth at home . The extra eight days in Mrs Saltmarsh's womb has mean that son Suntaj (left) and daughter Zarine (right) are stronger than their sister Yasmin and are in special care rather than intensive care . Ever since the couple met, Mr and Mrs Saltmarsh have longed to have their own baby. Mrs Saltmarsh has two sons - Sahil, 12, . and Simran, 15 - from a previous marriage. ‘For so long I had wanted just one more baby and to find out I was having three was just an overwhelming surprise,’ Mrs Saltmarsh told the Sydney Herald. Yasmin, remains vulnerable but she is progressing well in intensive care. Her younger sister Zarine and brother suntaj are in special care. Mrs Saltmarsh, pictured here with daughter Zarine (left) and son Suntaj (right), said that for so long she had wanted just one more baby and to find out she was having three was an overwhelming surprise . Dr Chris Wilkinson, Head of . maternal and foetal medicine at Adelaide's Women's and Children's . Hospital, said that in rare circumstances such as this, he and his team of experts allow babies to remain in the womb, giving them more time to grow and become stronger.

"By . Jamie Mcginnes . PUBLISHED: . 04:10 EST, 22 May 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 05:58 EST, 22 May 2012 . Polish schoolchildren are boosting English pupils' standards, a new study indicates. Although many Polish children arriving in Britain do not speak English as their first language, they do not seem to hold back classmates in reading and writing. And there is evidence they are actually helping to raise grades in subjects like mathematics. 'Welcome influence': Children of Eastern European immigrants appear to boost English pupils' performance in subjects like mathematics . The proportion of non-native pupils in primary schools in England has increased by a third to around 12% over the past 10 years - leading to fears they would take up too much of teachers' time. But research by the Centre for Economic Performance at the London School of Economics shows they actually appear to have a positive effect on English children. Prof Sandra McNally, who led the research, looked at data from 2005 to 2009 taken from the National Pupil database, a census of all children in English schools. The professor of economics at Surrey University, said: 'Evidence from Catholic schools attended by the children of Polish immigrants suggests that the presence of non-native English speakers might – in some cases, at least – have a positive effect on natives’ results.' High standards: Eastern European immigrants, like these children from Poland, may have benefited from better quality teaching in their homeland . Prof McNally said this could be due to better education standards in countries like Poland, as well as the work ethic of their parents, who had left their homeland to seek employment in Britain. She said: 'It may be the fact that immigrants from East European countries are better educated and more attached to the labour market than the native population. 'The children of such immigrants may be a welcome influence in the schools they attend.' There was an influx of Polish families in Britain after Poland joined the European Union in 2004. Data analysed by Prof McNally and her research team showed a much larger increase in white non-native English speakers in state Catholic schools than other schools - more than doubling from two per cent to nearly 4.5 per cent between 2005 and 2009. Prof McNally said it was possible Polish children caught up fast upon entering English schools. She added: 'They may have other things about them in their own environment that make them good to have in your school. 'They might have very motivated parents, for example.' Work ethic: One reason for Eastern European children's ability to boost results could be their 'very motivated parents'. Pictured is a group of Poles looking for work in London . Eastern European parents have complained that British schools are failing to challenge their children. The concerns of parents from Poland and other Eastern European countries were recorded in a paper published by the Government’s Economic and Social Research Council. Academics aimed to investigate discrimination suffered by foreign children but ended in recommending extra efforts by schools to ‘ensure that migrant children are challenged academically.’ The findings were based on detailed interviews with 57 children and families from Poland and the other seven countries which joined the EU eight years ago. Since then, as many as a million and a half workers from the new EU countries are estimated to have arrived in Britain to work.","Study suggests children from the Eastern European country help boost standards in mathematics .

A shipwreck discovered off the Isles of Scilly is thought to be a legendary vessel belonging to Sir Walter Raleigh - which sank as he searched for the 'Lost City Of Gold'. The stricken 50ft boat called Flying Joan set sail in 1617 from Plymouth in Devon towards the West Indies. It was part of a fleet led by Raleigh looking for the mythical riches of El Dorado - but was scuttled by a huge storm and sank without a trace. Diver Robin Burrows explores the newly discovered wreck of a ship believed to have been sailed by Sir Walter Raleigh . The shipwreck uncovered off the Isles of Scilly is believed to have been lost when a storm scattered his vessels as they headed for the West Indies . Sir Walter Raleigh's missing ship from his mission to find El Dorado may have been found . The 120 tonne ship has languished on the ocean floor for nearly 400 years. But divers now say they have found it off the coast of the Scilly Isles. Its sunken timber frame was found by divers in 50ft of water along with Tudor guns and fragments of ancient pottery. The stricken vessel was never located but local divers Todd Stevens and Robin Burrows have now asked English Heritage to confirm their find. Mr Stevens has nicknamed the 50ft wreck Lizzy and says photos and artefacts prove it is Raleigh's ship. He said: 'Since we first found the . Lizzy, I have always said that the evidence we have on the seabed leads . me to believe it to be the wreck of an armed pinnace. 'This would be a small, single-masted ship without a bowsprit and consequently a gun in the bow instead. 'The ship Sir Walter Raleigh lost here in a storm in 1617 was indeed an armed pinnace. The wreck fits in age and style.' The Flying Joan, captained by John . Chindley, was known to have sunk off Scilly on June 12, 1617 as it . departed the West Country, led by Raleigh's 440-tonne The Destiny. Diver Todd Stevens holds a piece of the shipwreck. The wreck, which has been named the Lizzy by the divers who discovered it, is thought to have possibly sunk in 1617 and been one of two ships lost out of a fleet of 30 shortly after they left Plymouth . Diver Robin Burrows believes the ship could have been the Flying Joan, one of the fleet on one of the last voyages led by Sir Walter Raleigh before he was executed at the Palace of Westminster in 1618 . In the sixteenth century, explorer Sir Walter Raleigh set sail in search of El Dorado - the legendary city full of gold and precious jewels. In 1594 Raleigh made the first of two expeditions in search of El Dorado. During the second he was accompanied by his son Watt who was killed during the adventure in 1617. In 1772 Scientist Alexander von Humboldt and botanist Aimé Bonpland voyaged to South America to once and for all prove or dispel the myth of El Dorado. When they return to Europe they spread their belief, that the city was nothing more than a dream of the early conquistadors. The fleet of 30 was ships scattered by a storm shortly after setting sail and two ships sank - including the Flying Joan. Little is known about the fate of the Flying Joan's 25 crew members, although historical records show Chindley made it to the West Indies on board another ship. The expedition was Raleigh's second failed attempt to find a 'City of Gold' somewhere between Trinidad and the north east coast of Venezuela. But his men later ransacked a Spanish outpost and Raleigh was arrested upon his return and executed in 1618 to appease the Spanish. The process of discovering the Lizzy, named for its guns dating to the late Tudor period, began in 2008 when Mr Stevens and his team conducted a magnetometer survey around the islands to detect anomalies.","Stricken 50ft boat called Flying Joan set sail in 1617 from Plymouth .

A CIA analyst has lifted the lid on the role of female intelligence officers hunting for Osama bin Laden. Susan Hasler worked at the CIA for 21 years and says although women were instrumental in tracking down the terrorist, they are still invisible. Mrs Hasler, who joined the agency in 1983, says it was women in the 1990s that first recognised the threat from Al Qaeda by piecing together intelligence. Vital role:  Zero Dark Thirty, starring Jessica Chastain in the lead role (pictured). Susan Hasler worked at the CIA for 21 years and says women were instrumental in hunting down the Osama Bin Laden . As a result she said she was bitterly . disappointed in May 2011 following the U.S operation to kill Bin Laden . after he was tracked to a compound in Pakistan. 'I watched talking heads on every network hold forth on the takedown. Almost without exception, they were men. I felt like my female colleagues had been erased from the picture,' she explained. A female agent was given much of the credit for refusing to give up in the 10 year manhunt and her story was told in Oscar-nominated film Zero Dark Thirty. The role of women in intelligence gathering has also been in the spotlight due to hit television series Homeland which features Carrie Mathison, a neurotic spy played by Clare Danes. The role of women in intelligence gathering has featured strongly on screen recently. The main character in hit American television series Homeland is a female called Carrie Mathison played by Clare Danes, pictured . Caught: Osama bin Laden was killed in May 2011 after a U.S led attack on his compound in Pakistan . Mrs Hasler, who resigned in 2004 and now lives in Singers Glen, Virginia told CNN that women are good counterterrorism analysts because they do not allow their ego to complicate their role. She said the amount of data to analyse is too vast for one person to comprehend and women are willing to admit what they do not know and ask for help. 'When it comes to ego suppression, women are just better at it than men. They've had more practice. I ran across one man who never admitted to any gaps in knowledge. 'Whenever someone would try to tell him something, he would blithely say, ""I knew that."" Mrs Hasler says the attributes of successful intelligence officers are persistence, tenacity, patience and dedication - all assets the women who tracked bin Laden displayed. She told CNN that to progress in the agency analysts need to work on accounts that attraction the attention of policymakers. But because Al .

This is the amazing collection of the world's most wonderful hot air balloons - and it includes everything from Coca Cola bottles to space shuttles and polar bears. They are all produced by Cameron Balloons, in Bristol, who make between 150 and 200 every year as the world's leading hot air balloon company. The company is owned by Scottish aeronautical engineer Donald Cameron, 73, who designed and flew western Europe's first modern hot air balloon in 1967 with a group of friends at the Bristol Gliding Club. One small step for man, to create one giant hot air balloon: A replica of a Nasa space shuttle which was created by Cameron Balloons in Bristol . They carried out their first test flight at the Weston on the Green RAF base in Oxfordshire, and Mr Cameron was hooked. Within four years he had quit his job as an engineer and started designing balloons full time. Now his company employ 67 people and they produce an incredible selection of balloons which they sell around the world. His daughter Hannah Cameron is one of the company's directors. The company was even responsible for the Breitling Orbiter 3 - the first balloon to fly around the world non-stop in 1999. Custom design: A hot air balloon designed to look like a polar bear which was created by Cameron Balloons. A balloon like this is made out of around 3,000 square metres of fabric . Wacky creation: A Bertie Bassett Liquorice Man, left. With the basket it stands at 51 metres tall and the fabric used would make up to 1,340 suits. Right is a custom-designed Scottish-piper balloon . Over the years they have created balloons designed to look like shopping trolleys, newspapers, Darth Vader, Thomas the Tank engine, a Harley Davidson and the FA Cup for clients. A recent Ben & Jerry's ice cream cone that they created measures 28.5metres tall when fully-inflated and 21.4metres across at its widest point. In total, it required 3,809 square metres of fabric. If the area inside was to be filled with ice cream, it would take 2.3million kilograms of the tasty treat to fill it up. The creations take around 12 weeks complete from the day the order is placed to when it is ready to fly. Bigfoot: This balloon is designed to look like a shoe, and has each of the laces fitted. The tiny weaved basket can be seen underneath . Childrens' favourite: A Thomas the Tank Engine balloon designed by Cameron Balloons takes off at daybreak near Tower Bridge in central London . Terrifying: A Darth Vader balloon gets ready for take off, let, while this is the face of a Van Gogh made for a Dutch beer company (right) The company's cheapest balloons are designed to hold three or four people and cost £20,000 but the high-end custom models are priced at in excess of £50,000. Hannah Cameron, director, said that a team of 16 people work on each of the projects. 'The first thing we do is hold a face-to-face meeting with the person who is buying the balloon to find out exactly what they want and exactly what colours they want us to use,' she said. 'At this point we make a 2D visual with 3D characteristics so they can see what it will look like from every angle once made. We can also produce a 3D scale model which is small enough to sit on a desk so it gives a clear idea of what it will look like. Fairytale: Mickey Mouse shows off a Disney castle balloon designed by the Bristol-based firm . 'The next stage is production. The bulk of the balloon is made from ripstop nylon which is a very lightweight material. Some specialist fabrics are used at the mouth and at the top of the balloon. 'During the production process we use everything from a pair of scissors through to specialist cutting equipment. It takes 16 of our staff about 12 weeks to produce a balloon.' A basic model will use about 1,000 square metres of fabric and three kilometres of thread - although more specialist models use three times as much. Cameron Balloons, based in Bedminster, Bristol, are the world's largest balloon manufacturer. Up for the cup: A 38 metre tall model of the FA Cup which is made out of 3,664 metres of fabric and would cover over half the Wembley pitch if it was flattened (left) and (right) a newspaper is turned into a hot air balloon . Terrifying! A T-rex style hot air balloon which is so intricately designed that each of its teeth are filled with air and inflated as well (left) and children's favourite Rupert the Bear (right) For founder Mr Cameron, it all began in July 1967 when his first balloon - the red and white striped Bristol Belle - took off from Weston on the Green. His daughter Hannah said: 'My father enjoyed gliding and he had heard of a balloon being used in the military in the US and he wrote off to them. A man who had flown it wrote back to him about it. 'He thought it would be fun to make one of them and learn to fly it over here. So applying what he had been told and some good science he created one for himself. 'At the time there were no hot air balloons in Europe so the story caused a sensation.' Remarkable: A balloon designed to look like a Formula One Car which was created by the Bristol-based company for the Australian Grand Prix. Around 85 per cent of the balloons made by the British company are exported . Two very different birds: The company produce between 150 and 200 balloons a year - including this Eagle, left, and an Angry Bird balloon, right . Weird creations: They have made all types of balloons - from world-record-breaking balloons - to weird and wacky shapes, film characters, space shuttles and even an upside-down balloon . Udderly incredible: A winged cow floats through the sky (right). This is one of the Bristol-based company's most wacky creations . Balloons over Bristol: The Sky above Bristol is a sea of colour during the annual ballooning festival held every August . The balloon was made out of ripstock nylon - just as modern ones are today - and is still kept in the Cameron Balloons headquarters. Ms Cameron said: 'Ballooning is one of these amazing things. Even a straightforward balloon - people will stop and wave, and take photographs. 'It's the best way to fly. The views from a balloon are incredible - you can see for miles and miles. 'I've been flying since I was three-years-old and it's much more interesting than flying in a plane. There's a bit of chance to it as well - you're never quite sure where you're going to end up. Measured approach: The material is selected for the latest hot air balloon to roll off the Bristol production line. The bulk of each balloon is made out of lightweight ripstock nylon . Stitch-up: A woman uses a sewing machine to stitch together the panels of fabric which will make up a balloon. Even a small one uses three kilometres of stitching . She said that the company has produced some amazing models over the years. 'One of my favourite ones is the Tyrannosaurus rex. When it's inflating or landing you can be chomped by its teeth. We've done all sorts, from a full Scottish pipe major, a lightbulb, Disney castles and UFOs. 'The hard ones to design are the very tall and slim ones or the slim horizontal ones. You need to bulk them out to get more volume, without compromising the design. 'A Coke bottle is technically hard to do - as it's tall and thin, you have to make the balloon so big to counteract that, while still being true to the customer's wishes.' Production process: One of the member's of staff works on a new wicker basket for one of the smaller balloons which holds around three people (left) while a woman works on the sewing machine (right) Production: Two workers in the factory in Bedminster, Bristol, at work on their sewing machines .

The number of residents fell by 206,000 to 47.1million, the National Statistics Institute said, a figure entirely accounted for by foreign residents. It was the first time a population drop had been recorded in official statistics since records began in 1857 - although until 1998 figures were published roughly every decade, rather than annually. Jobless: People wait outside an unemployment office in Madrid. Spain's population has fallen for the first time . Spain and the rest of Southern Europe are suffering twin economic and fiscal crises. During a long economic boom that ended abruptly in 2008, Spanish-speaking immigrants from Ecuador, Colombia and Bolivia flocked to Spain to work in construction. Between 2000 and 2010, the immigrant population swelled from 924,000 to 5.7million. But building has come to a standstill since a housing bubble burst, and a government spending squeeze to try to meet strict deficit cutting targets imposed by Brussels has further strained the economy. As the unemployment rate has soared to 26 per cent, many immigrants have returned home. Rise and fall: This graph of the population of foreigners in Spain over the last ten years shows that between 2004 and 2010, the immigrant population swelled to 5.7million . The biggest fall in registered foreign residents was among South Americans, especially Ecuadoreans and Colombians, the statistics agency said.

'There was extraordinary growth (in immigrants) from 2000 to 2009, which is reversing quickly due to the economic crisis,' demographer Albert Esteve of the Barcelona Centre for Demographic Studies told Spain National Radio. 'Spain is less attractive because there are no jobs.' Spain’s two largest groups of immigrants, Romanians and Moroccans, both shrank last year. Not only are immigrants returning home; many Spaniards are also leaving to look for work abroad. The youth unemployment rate is higher than 50 per cent. The population of native Spaniards grew last year by 10,000, a smaller increase than in recent years, only minimally offsetting a fell of 216,000 in the number of registered foreigners.","Resident number fell by 206,000 to 47.1m, National Statistics Institute says .

Unrepentant: Imelda Marcos, widow of the late dictator Ferdinand Marcos, holds two-day-old Zian Jay Rosay during her campaign for re-election . Imelda Marcos, the widow of dictator Ferdinand Marcos known for her extravagant lifestyle and thousands of shoes, has been pressing the flesh with the people of the Philippines as she attempts to keep her seat on the country's congress. The 83-year-old was pictured holding a baby and shaking hands with her electorate at the Mothering Center, one of her health projects, in the Ilocos Norte province, in the northern Philippines yesterday. Marcos is running for re-election in the May 13 mid-term elections as congresswoman in Ilocos Norte, the home province of her late husband, where she was first elected in 2010. During her husband's reign, known for corruption, political repression and human rights violations, Imelda's extravagant lifestyle reportedly included £3million shopping trips in New York, Rome and Copenhagen and she once sent a plane to pick up Australian white sand for a new beach resort. She was especially notorious for her shoe collection, which was estimated to be around 2,700 pairs. While many of her countrymen languished in poverty, she purchased a portfolio of desirable properties in Manhattan in the 1980s, which was later seized and sold, along with many of her jewels and most of her extensive art collection. Marcos also orchestrated lavish public events using millions of dollars in public funds to laud her husband's regime and her own public image. The Marcoses fled the Philippines at the climax of the army-backed 'people power' revolt in 1986 and left behind staggering amounts of personal belongings, clothes and art objects at their palace, including at least 1,220 pairs of the former first lady's shoes. Legacy: Marcos stands beside a bust of her dictator husband, who was ousted in an uprising . Laughter: Marcos is running for re-election in the May 13 mid-term elections . Ferdinand Marcos died in exile in Hawaii in 1989 and his widow and children returned home in 1991. She continues to fight the government over her abandoned assets more than two decades after her husband’s reign ended. The Marcoses, their relatives and business cronies were accused of looting up to £6billion from state coffers and faced up to 900 cases of corruption and other charges.

When she announced her shock decision to run for election in 2010, she was pictured kissing the glass coffin of her embalmed husband and said: 'He was our best ever president. 'During his time we had territorial integrity, freedom, justice and human rights. Whatever else people may say those were the best times ever for the Philippines.' About a third of Manila’s 12 million residents live in slums, and a third of 94 million Filipinos live below the poverty line of $1.25 a day. Marcos was born in Manila. Her paternal ancestors were wealthy, powerful landowners. She married Ferdinand Marcos in 1953 and was instrumental in his rise to power. In 1966, Ferdinand Marcos became the 10th President of the Philippines In 1972 he declared martial law to preserve his hold on power. Together with Imelda, he would rule the Philippines until his removal in February 1986. His wife was appointed to numerous powerful positions in the government. In December of 1972, Carlito Dimahilig tried to stab her to death with a bolo knife during an award ceremony broadcast live on television. He was gunned down by police. The wounds on Marcos' hands and arms required 75 stitches. On February 25, 1986, Ferdinand Marcos and his family fled to Hawaii after his regime was toppled by the four-day revolution. The uprising was sparked in part by rumours that the couple were involved in the 1983 assassination of Benigno S. Aquino, Jr., Marcos' foremost political opponent.

Charlie was an RNLI crew volunteer at Rock lifeboat station for eight . years - and only finished two years ago because of business commitments. He is a married father of a five-month-old daughter and runs the Camel Ski School, . which rents out equipment for Cornish holidaymakers. Today he spoke about the incident for the first time, and said that it was important to remember the those who died or were hurt in the tragedy. 'There were many ""heroes"" in this tragic incident, all of whom did a remarkable job in difficult circumstances,' he said in a statement through the RNLI. 'However, now is a time to solely reflect on the bereaved and injured family members and their wider family and friends. 'My thoughts are with them all and will be for a long time to come. 'I have nothing more to add and would hope that our community can now be . left to deal with this tragedy in own own way and in peace and quiet.' Sky TV executive Nick Milligan, 51, and his eight-year-old daughter Emily were killed after they were run over by the out-of-control vessel. His yoga-teacher wife Victoria, 41, and their four-year-old son Kit both face losing their legs from 'life-changing' wounds caused by the £60,000 craft's propeller. The couple's other children Olivia, 10, and Amber 12, are in hospital after being injured when they were thrown from their boat and hit. Tragedy: The Milligan family, with father Nick holding eight-year-old Emily, left, both of whom lost their lives in the speedboat crash in Padstow on Sunday. Victoria, 41, Kit, four, Olivia, 10, and Amber 12, are in hospital . Aftermath: An amateur video showing the empty speedboat out of control at Padstow shortly after the fatal incident . Danger: The boat was completely out of control following the incident in Padstow, Cornwall, on Bank Holiday Sunday . Bravery: The video, filmed from the shore, shows Mr Toogood jumping on to the speedboat . Meanwhile the Milligan family are 'as well as can be hoped', Nick's elder . brother said today. Mark Milligan spoke briefly outside the family home in London this afternoon. 'The investigation is on going. The family is doing as well as they can,' the 53-year-old said. Asked about the condition of Mr Milligan’s wife Victoria and son Kit, Mr Milligan said: 'They are still being treated. 'I’ve seen the children, they’re all doing as well as you can hope for'. He added that 'Lots of people have been very understanding' when asked about the support offered to the family. He said he was at his brother’s detached house situated next to Wandsworth Common, 'to handle (his brother’s) affairs'. Instructor: Mr Toogood, 32, intervened to prevent further disaster after the speedboat killed two people . Experienced: Mr Toogood runs his own business hiring out boats to holidaymakers in Cornwall . Mr Toogood's actions are credited with saving the lives of Nick Milligan’s remaining family, with police and coastguards having . praised Mr Toogood’s ‘incredible seamanship and bravery’ which prevented . further tragedy during the horrifying accident. Matt Pavitt, from the North Cornwall Coastguard, said: ‘He managed to manoeuvre his boat alongside the vessel which was going round and round in circles, picked his moment and jumped.’ Detective Superintendent Jim Colwell added: ‘Without the brave and heroic efforts of local people and holidaymakers in the minutes immediately after this incident in assisting the family while they were in the water, I’m confident that this would have been far worse in terms of the overall death toll.’ Mr Toogood, a married father in his early 30s, had last night declined to talk about his heroics but his mother Sarah said he was ‘in a bit of a state’. Another friend added: ‘He is devastated. Everyone is rightly calling  him a hero, but he felt he was helpless that he couldn’t do more to save the others.’ Teenager Will Jones was named as the helmsman of Mr Toogood’s boat. His sister Amy said: ‘My brother is still very shaken up from it all.’ Police at the scene of a boat crash at Padstow harbour where a father and daughter died .

North Korea's youthful despot Kim Jong Un today made his first visit to the secretive state's latest scientific facility - an institute dedicated to research into grass. The 29-year-old toured the Turf Institute of the Bioengineering Branch under the State Academy of Sciences in suburban Pyongyang with his usual coterie of generals in tow. It was the first time the young dictator has been pictured since May Day and comes after North Korea yesterday revealed a few more details about an American just sentenced to 15 years' hard labour. Another tour: North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un . inspects the newly built Turf Institute of the Bioengineering Branch . under the State Academy of Sciences in suburban Pyongyang, his first official visit since May Day . Pyongyang officials claimed Kenneth Bae entered North Korea with a false identity and rejected speculation that they intend to use his jail sentence as a bargaining chip. Today though, Kim appeared to put all thoughts of international diplomacy behind him as he walked the corridors and labs of the Turf Institute, which state media described as 'newly constructed by soldiers'. He 'was pleased to see the green-tiled outer wall' and he 'praised the soldier-builders for erecting the monument to the institute in an imposing manner,' according to translations of local news reports published by the blog North Korea Leadership Watch. Accompanied by a group of uniformed senior military personnel, but clad in his customary luxuriously tailored baggy suit, Kim toured the institutes exhibition of its accomplishments, its research facilities, study centre and e-library. He also toured the Turf Institute's greenhouses where various species of grass are cultivated for research, its commissary and its staff quarters. Don't step on the grass: Kim talks to an . official in one of the Institute's greenhouses, where research is . carried out into different varieties of turf. He said it was essential . to find varieties that are green all year round . Take this down: Kim speaks as his generals take . note of his decrees. He spoke of 'the need to plant trees, create . grassland and cultivate flowers and other plants in all lands except the . cultivated land,' KCNA reported . Veeery interesting: Clad in his customary . luxuriously tailored baggy suit, Kim toured the institute's exhibition . of its accomplishments (seen here), its research facilities, study centre and . e-library . 'What is essential in the research into turf is to cultivate turf which remains green all the year round, strong in resistance to cold and treading and high in ornamental effect,' Kim said, according to the state-run Korean Central News Agency. He also spoke of 'the need to plant . trees, create grassland and cultivate flowers and other plants in all . lands except the cultivated land so that there may be no land left waste . or overgrown with weed.' Kim's words came as Korean-American Kenneth Bae continued to be held in a North Korean jail at the start of his sentence for alleged crimes against the Communist state. In remarks carried by state media, an unidentified Foreign Ministry spokesman did not specify the Washington state man's crimes but said he confessed. He said Bae entered North Korea 'with a disguised identity in an intentional way under the back-stage manipulation of the forces hostile toward' the country. On the straight and narrow: Kim 'was pleased to see the green-tiled outer wall' and 'praised the soldier-builders for erecting the monument to the institute in an imposing manner,' KCNA reported . So you put your hands like this, and push? Kim asks questions about the equipment used at the institute . Let's fo that way! The young despot points into the distance as he wanders out of the institute, perhaps on his way to deal with pressing matters of international diplomacy like the jailing of American Kenneth Bae . Bae, 44, was arrested in early November in Rason, a special economic zone in North Korea's far north-eastern region bordering China and Russia, according to the North's state media. Friends say Bae is a devout Christian and tour operator based in China who traveled frequently to North Korea to feed orphans. Hard labour: Bae was arrested in early . November in Rason, a special economic zone in North Korea's far . north-east, near its borders with China and Russia . Six other Americans have been detained in North Korea since 2009; they eventually were deported or released, some after trips by prominent Americans including former presidents Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter. But the North Korean spokesman dismissed as 'ridiculous and wrong' speculation by foreign media that Pyongyang intends to use Bae as a bargaining chip for another such visit to the country. He said the 'generosity' the country showed in past cases 'will be of no use in ending Americans' illegal acts.' North Korea 'has no plan to invite anyone of the U.S. as regards Pae's issue,' the spokesman said. Pyongyang refers to Bae as Pae Jun Ho, the North Korean spelling for his Korean name. Bae's sentencing last week came as tension remains on the Korean Peninsula following weeks of warlike rhetoric from Pyongyang and threats to attack the U.S. and South Korea. The U.S. has called for the North to grant amnesty and immediately release Bae. The U.S. and North Korea officially remain at war because the 1950-53 Korean War ended with an armistice, not a peace treaty. Despite the continuing crisis, thoughts of war appeared to be the back of the North Korean leader's mind today at the Turf Institute where, according to KCNA, he 'underscored the need to turn the country into a socialist thriving nation and make it richer and more beautiful for the people.'","Kim Jong Un visits new scientific facility dedicated to research into turf .

The lawyer is said to have illegally passed on information to Gaddafi, who has a PhD from the London School of Economics. Accused: Saif al-Islam Gaddafi, the British-educated son of former Libyan dictator Colonel Gaddafi, appeared in a criminal court today accused of threatening state security . The court, in the Libyan town of Zintan, heard that Gaddafi is also facing war crimes allegations dating back to the 2011 rebellion which saw his father deposed and killed after more than four decades in power. Today Gaddafi appointed local lawyers for the first time, and spoke to confirm his identity. When asked his state of health he gave a thumbs up sign. Gaddafi faces charges of illegally exchanging classified information, obtaining documents that threatened Libyan national security and insulting the country's new national flag. Gaddafi wore a sky blue suit and a pair of sandals at today's court appearance. He remained standing throughout the 15-minute hearing. Family: Saif al-Islam , left , is the son of former Libyan dictator Colonel Gaddafi, right . Evidence was briefly presented at the hearing, including a pen with a camera in it and a watch.The prosecution alleges that both devices were used to pass on secret information. In June last year, ICC lawyer Melinda Taylor and three other ICC staff were arrested and held for the three weeks after visiting Gaddafi. The lawyer was accused of secretly passing Gaddafi a coded letter from a fugitive former aide, Mohammed Ismail. The four were subsequently released to The Hague and are not expected to return to Libya to face charges. Representatives from human rights organisations were also present at the hearing, at which Gaddafi's trial was postponed until 19 September.

A schoolboy is to make his debut in a Hollywood film, but he needn't worry if his acting skills are a little rigid - he will appear as a fibreglass figure of a boy soldier. Artist Tristan Schoonrad created his life-size boy soldier with grenade and tin helmet using moulds taken of his nephew Kai when he was aged seven. Now aged 11, Kai is set to see his arty incarnation star on the big screen with the sculpture set to feature in Kick Ass 2 which will be released later this summer. Art imitates life: Kai Schoonrad pictured with a cast taken of him when he was aged seven, (left) and the finished Boy Soldier sculpture by his artist uncle Tristan Schoonrad . The striking figure had already proved a . hit with actor Brad Pitt requesting his own personal copy of the . artwork after working on a film with Tristan and Blur front man Damon . Albarn also owning a version. Tristan, 33, who has been working in the film industry since he was 15, spent a painstaking two months taking the moulds of Kai's arms, legs, torso and head before assembling the figure. Taking accurate moulds of the seven year old was a tricky task as Kai had to sit completely still, particularly for the facial mould. But according to Tristan, from Borehamwood, Hertfordshire, Kai was the model professional throughout the work. Talented: Artist Tristan Schoonrad, who created the Boy Soldier sculpture from a life cast of his nephew Kai . He said: 'My brother was kind enough to let me borrow Kai for these models and he was great. 'When I was taking a mould of the face he had to be so still and he kept the same facial expression the whole time. 'Kai was a bit indifferent about doing it at first. I think he would prefer to be out playing football or something. 'The art work itself has done really well but I don’t quite make enough to live on just yet.' Versions of the boy soldier usually fetch around £7,000 a time. Tristan found his way into the film industry following in his father John's footsteps - he worked at Elstree Studios when Tristan was growing up. On visits to the studio with his father, Tristan found his way on to such film sets as Indiana Jones: The Raiders of the Lost Ark and Star Wars: Return of the Jedi. Now, Tristan, John and brother Robin all work for Lifecast Ltd, the family firm. Tristan's own work, mainly in special effects, make up and prosthetics, has seen him work on films such as Rambo, Troy, the Harry Potter films and Gladiator. His focus shifted slightly from the world of film to the art world when a friend suggested he exhibit some of his work. He said:  'I have been doing mould making and special effects work since I was 15 because that is what my Dad has always done. 'I had begun to construct models similar to these for work but then about three years ago one of my friends said I should put it up in her art show so I did.' Some of Tristan's work was featured on a plinth in Parliament Square in 2011.

The seven-time Italian Prime Minister was accused of using political cunning to help the Mafia . The former Italian prime minister who laid the ambush that brought down Margaret Thatcher over the European single currency has died, aged 94. Giulio Andreotti, who was known for his Machiavellian style of politics, plotted with other European leaders to mount a surprise attack on Baroness Thatcher at a 1990 summit. The talks were a catastrophe, which set in motion the chain of events that led to her resignation. The seven-time premier died at home in Rome yesterday, after a long illness. At the Rome summit of 1990 the European Monetary Union was high on the agenda and Thatcher’s prophetic voice was alone against it. Thatcher was fundamentally opposed to the Euro because there was no history of a successful currency union without a political union. But, effectively ambushed by the 11 other head of states, she was trapped. Boris Johnson later described it as ‘a blood-curdling scene.’ He remembered: ‘Thatch was backed into a corner — a minority of one — as they all piled into her.’ Within days, Deputy Prime Minister Geoffrey Howe resigned over her handling of EU relations and his dramatic speech was the key catalyst for the leadership challenge by Michael Heseltine. This was followed soon after by her own resignation. After Baroness Thatcher’s death last month, Gianni De Michelis, Andreotti’s foreign minister, remembered how the Italians plotted to bring her down. He said: ‘In September 1990, we, Italy, who had the presidency of the EU, decided on her political downfall. ‘She was convinced of her arguments and she thought she was better than other people and would therefore get the result she wanted. In general this was true but not this time.’ The Iron Lady later described Andreotti having ‘a positive aversion to principles’. At his prime, Andreotti, known as the Godfather of Italian politics, was one of the country’s most powerful men. He helped draft the country’s . constitution after World War II, sat in parliament for 60 years. ‘Power . wears out ... those who don’t have it,’ he once famously said. The 94-year-old former Prime Minister died after a long illness . Margaret Thatcher with Italian Prime Minister Giulio Andreotti (c) at a meeting. Mr Andreotti led an ambush against Mrs Thatcher over the European single currency. She resigned from government shortly afterwards . But he was a controversial figure who was tainted by corruption scandals and accused of aiding the Mafia. He was tainted by his friendship with Roberto Calvi, the Vatican-linked financier known as God’s Banker, who was found hanging under Blackfriars Bridge in London in 1982. Both men were said to be members of P2, a secret Masonic lodge to which hundreds of Italian politicians, businessmen, secret service agents, policemen, civil servants and others belonged. In 2002, in what was dubbed the trial of the century Andreotti was convicted of ordering the murder of an Italian journalist. And he was accused of exchanging a ‘kiss of honour’ with the mafia’s long-time No. 1 boss. Prosecutors alleged Andreotti granted favours for the Sicilian Cosa Nostra in exchange for their delivering votes for his party. He was eventually cleared. but suspicion and scandal stuck, as well as a host of grimy nicknames including the Black Pope and Beelzebub. A character in the Godfather film series was based on him. Andreotti always denied the charges, again maintaining he was a victim of mob bosses intent on taking revenge for his fight against the Mafia.","Former Italian Prime Minister, Giulio Andreotti, dies in Rome after long illness .

A woman who lost her birth certificate aged 12 has finally been given a passport after 14 years in legal limbo - but only after undergoing DNA tests to prove that she is British. Allem Kerr, 26, was left unable to work, apply for a driving licence or holiday abroad with officials unable to give her a passport because there was no official record of her birth. Her Scottish parents MS sufferer Ann, 56, and her full time carer husband Andrew, 60, have struggled to support their daughter over the years while she desperately tried to register her existence. She attempted to contact the South African hospital where she was born only to find it had closed down and even wrote to Prime Minister David Cameron asking for help. Relieved: Allem Kerr, 26, is planning a holiday after receiving a British passport after 14 years in legal limbo . But a DNA test has now finally proven to the Court of Session in Edinburgh that Miss Kerr is her Scottish mother's daughter and eligible for a UK passport. She said: 'It's been a nightmare of red tape but I'm so relieved that I officially exist. 'I'm British. I happen to have been born in South Africa but I have lived in Scotland almost my entire life, but proving it has been a real problem.' Allem, West Dunbartonshire, Scotland, was repeatedly told by Home Office officials and the consulate of South Africa that there was no record of her birth and attempts to contact the hospital where she was born proved futile as she discovered it had closed and records been moved or lost. She even wrote to Downing Street desperate to resolve her plight, but to no avail. She said: 'I wrote to David Cameron and his secretary replied that she would pass it on to the Home Office, but that was months ago and I've heard nothing. 'We even tried to contact the hospital where I was born and the doctor who delivered me but it is not there anymore.' UK citizen: Allem was only able to prove to the courts that she is eligible for a British passport by undergoing a DNA test . Allem was born in South Africa after her Scottish parents decided to emigrate, but the family returned to Britain when she was four. Her brother Alasdair, 28, and sister Mallory, 24, both have their birth certificates but Allem lost hers when the family moved to a new house when she was 12. Since then she and her parents have tried in vain to track down the vital piece of paper. Her last foreign holiday was on a school trip 11 years ago when she went on a group passport. Allem won her lengthy identity battle after contacting lawyers who applied for a declaration of parentage at the Court of Session. DNA tests were ordered and she has finally received her passport - and now she is planning her first holiday for over a decade. She said: 'I would love to go to Greece, and France - in fact there are so many places to go. I feel I have a lot of catching up to do. 'I'm also saving up for a car and I have finally been able to send away for my provisional driving licence.'","Allem Kerr was left unable to work, holiday abroad or get a driving licence .

As North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un appears to finally be toning down the warlike rhetoric that has kept the region on edge for the past months, a U.S journalist has told how she was sentenced to 12 years hard labour in communist state. Tensions escalated after North Korea put a satellite into space in December last year and conducted a nuclear test in February. The test triggered new U.N. sanctions, which led to a barrage of threats from Pyongyang. North Korea reacted furiously to the two-month long joint exercises between the U.S. and South Korea which saw nuclear-capable stealth bombers used in drills close to the border. Ordeal: US journalists Laura Ling (centre) and Euna Lee (right with Al Gore) were . sentenced to 12 years hard labour after crossing the frozen Tumen River . into North Korea in 2009 . Appeal: Laura Ling (Center) and Euna Lee (right) were freed after President Bill Clinton (left) went to the rogue country to carry out negotiations on their behalf . Kim Jong Un was pictured rallying North Korean troops and conducting military drills and had threatened missile strikes against the south and the U.S. But in recent days the young leader has been pictured attending sports events and visiting a health complex with his wife, signalling a break in tensions. Dongguk University professor Kim Yong-Hyun told the Australian Associated Press the North Korea could be waiting for the conclusion of talks between Barack Obama and South Korea's new leader Park Geun-Hye, scheduled to take place on May 7, before deciding on a new course of action. He said: 'North Korea appears to be taking a breather after its brinkmanship reached fever pitch. 'North Korea wants some gestures from Obama. Then it may try to open dialogue with the United States as it did before.' Korean-American Kenneth Bae was yesterday sentenced to 15 years 'compulsory labour' Yesterday the communist state sentenced American citizen Kenneth Bae to 15 years of hard laborfor crimes against the state, prompting a U.S. call for his amnesty in hopes of avoiding him becoming a bargaining chip between the two countries. Mr Bae, 44, was born in South Korea but is a naturalized U.S. citizen and studied psychology for two years at the University of Oregon. In 2009 U.S. journalists Laura Ling and Euna Lee were captured after sneaking into North Korea from China in 2009 and sentenced to 12 years hard labour. They were freed after serving 140 days in captivity after former U.S. president Bill Clinton flew to Pyongyang to appeal to the then leader Kim Jong Il for their release. Speaking to CBS news Ling told of her ordeal and the brutal treatment she received at the hands of her captors. Ling and Lee had crossed the frozen Tumen River, to enter North Korea, but had turned back almost immediately without venturing further into the country. But North Korean border guards pursued them over the ice before capturing them on the Chinese side and dragging them back across the river into North Korea. One of the guards knocked Ms Ling unconscious with the butt of his rifle and the next thing she recalls was waking up in captivity. Ling and Lee were kept apart and charged with illegal entry and hostile acts before being transferred to Pyongyang. They were forced to confess to plotting to overthrow the North Korean government and following a secret trial were sentenced to 12 years of hard labor. Ms Lee said cried out loud in the courtroom when her labor camp sentence was handed down. Tensions: North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un (3rd left) is pictured at a soccer match with his wife. There has been a marked decrease in the amount of aggressive rhetoric coming from the communist state in recent days . Smiles: Kim Jong-Un and his wife Ri Sol-Ju appear relaxed as they are pictured watching sports games on the May Day holiday . She said: 'The word 'Labor camp"" took the tiny hope I had away from me. I was physically and mentally weak and I really thought I would not make it home,' The pair were held separately under guard but in what Ms Ling describes as a 'regular' rooms. There were frequent power cuts and water outages meant she was often forced to wash by boiling hot water in a kettle. Contact with the outside world was limited however she managed to contact her sister, husband and parents and was also able to receive mail. She passed the time by focusing on how she could escape and practisng yoga and meditation. Ms Ling told CBS: 'I was never sent to one of the notorious labor camps. 'I was in a room that had a bed and a bathroom and an adjoining room that had two female guards.' Ling and Lee were pardoned on humanitarian grounds and released to former President Clinton, who met with then-leader Kim Jong Il. U.S.-North Korea talks came later that year. Like Ms Ling, it is likely Mr Bae will avoid being held in one of the state's forced labor camps. Human rights groups say more than 200,000 people are incarcerated in these camps, where they are beaten and starved, sometimes to death. Human rights activists in South Korea say Bae may have been arrested for taking pictures of starving children. Kenneth Bae, pictured on a South Korean news broadcast, is at least the sixth American detained in North Korea since 2009 . Bae is 'a committed Christian,"" said David Ross, director of a missionary training center at Antioch World Ministries Inc. in Monroe, Washington. 'He has feelings for orphans and has done some ministry work feeding orphans,' added Ross, who said he has been a casual acquaintance of Bae since they met four years ago through church  affiliations in Hawaii. 'He has a missionary heart,' Ross said. White House spokesman Jay Carney said any negotiations with North Korea are 'dependent upon the North Koreans demonstrating a willingness to live up to their international obligations.' North Korea is the subject of U.N. Security Council resolutions calling for an end to its nuclear and missile tests, as well as punitive U.N. sanctions. Some media reports have identified Bae as the leader of the tour group. NK News, a specialist North Korea news website, said he was the owner of a company called Nation Tours that specialized in tours of northeastern North Korea. Bird flu precautions: An unmanned helicopter is used during precautionary quarantine measures in Hwaseong City, Gyeonggi Province, South Korea today over fears the H7N9 bird flu virus could spread from China . The reports could not be verified and North Korean state news agency KCNA did not list any specific charge other than crimes against the state, and used a Korean rendering of Bae's name, Pae  Jun-ho, when it reported the Supreme Court ruling. 'North Korea has shown their intention to use him as a negotiating card as they have done in the past,' said Cheong Seong-chang, senior fellow at the Sejong Institute, a think-tank in Seoul. North Korea appears to use the release of high-profile American prisoners to extract a form of personal tribute, rather than for economic or diplomatic gain, often portraying visiting dignitaries as paying homage. Former U.S. President Jimmy Carter, who has traveled to North Korea before to try to free a detained American, has no plans to do so for Bae, Carter's spokeswoman said. According to North Korean law, the punishment for hostile acts against the state is between five and 10 years hard labor. South Korean officials are also on alert over fears the recent bird flu outbreak. The deadly H7N9 bird flu strain has broken out in China in recent weeks claiming at least 26 lives. Unmanned helicopters were used to spray areas as part of quarantine measures at a bay in Hwaseong City, Gyeonggi Province.","Korean-American Kenneth Bae, 44 sentenced to 15 years hard labor .

Former South Carolina governor Mark Sanford released a full page ad in a local newspaper explaining why he was caught leaving his ex-wife's house, the revelation of which started a domino effect for his congressional campaign. He didn't stop explaining his side of the story with the 1,200-word ad either, as he included his real cell phone number in the 'personal message', encouraging voters to call him with questions. 'I think that people always want to know the real story, the full story,' he told MailOnline by phone. 'Context matters': Former South Carolina governor Mark Sanford told MailOnline that he released a full page ad in order to get his side of the trespassing story out to the voters before the election . The Republican former governor was the subject of an ethics investigation after he was caught returning to his home state after a trip to visit his mistress in Argentina even though he told his staff he was hiking on the Appalachian Trail. The affair lead to his fall from grace, and eventual divorce from his wife Jenny. Now the details of their divorce have come to light after she filed a lawsuit against him for a 'pattern' of trespassing after he entered her Sullivans’ Island home without her permission in early February. Last-ditch effort: Sanford's campaign took out a lengthy ad in a local paper over the weekend as his poll numbers drop just two weeks before the election . That lawsuit led to an explanation from Sanford- who said he was watching the second half of the Super Bowl with his 14-year-old son while his ex was out of town- but that didn't stop the National Republican Congressional Committee from pulling their funding from the race. And that move came even before Jenny confirmed that the first time that one of the couples' sons met his Argentinian mistress-turned-fiancée was on stage at his primary victory party just weeks ago. When MailOnline spoke to Mr Sanford on . Monday, he said that he felt the need to take out the lengthy ad in The . Post and Courier in order to make sure that the voters knew the whole . story. 'I think that context matters,' he said. The . first reports of the trespassing incident in question drew from the . court documents that Jenny Sanford's legal team filed, saying that he . was seen leaving the back door of her Sullivans Island home using his . cell phone as a flashlight. 'That's a rather spooky story- it would creep anybody out,' he said. For that reason, he and his campaign staff felt the need to flesh it out more in print, in wordy detail. 'I . did, indeed, watch the second half of the Super Bowl at the beach house . with our 14-year-old son because, as a father, I didn't think he should . sit alone and watch it. Given Jenny was out of town, I tried to reach . her beforehand to tell her of the situation that had arisen, and met her . at the back steps and told her what had happened under the light of my . cell phone when she returned,' the ad reads. The 10-paragraph ad goes on to talk . about the influx of funding from Democratic political action committees, . backing his competitor Elizabeth Colbert Busch. It . also talks about his history of cutting government spending, even . taking the unexpected route of bringing up his frugality when it came to . his trips while serving as the state's governor. Awkward: Mark Sanford's son is visibly uncomfortable when he was standing next to his father's mistress-turned-fiancee Maria Belen Chapur, a woman he had met for the first time just moments before . Celebration: Sanford leans in for a kiss with his fiancee following his win on Tuesday night . Considering . his ethics charges- of which he was cleared- surrounding the . extramarital affair stemmed from the cost of his trips to meet his . mistress, talking about other issues may have seemed like the more . politically safe option. One . thing he does not mention in the ad is the report that one of his son's . first meetings with his father's mistress-turned-fiancée was onstage at . his victory party for his primary win earlier this month. When . asked if the public venue was really the first time that his son had . met his future stepmother, he said: 'one of them had and one of them . hadn't'. 'That's the nature of a surprise- I didn't know she was coming,' he said of his fiancée Maria Belen Chapur. The report of the awkward encounter made news when Jenny Sanford confirmed it on Wednesday. The . trespassing revelation, family introduction at the victory party and . the withdrawal of NRCC funding all made for- as, Sanford said in the ad, . ‘a rough week’. And now a new poll shows that it has taken its toll. Ex-couples court: Former governor Mark Sanford . (left, now running for the state's open congressional seat) is accused . of trespassing on his ex-wife's property and she confirmed the victory party incident . Trespassing: Jenny Sanford's lawyer filed court documents stating that her ex-husband Mark repeatedly entered her Sullivans Island home (pictured) without permission . The Democratic-leaning Public Policy Polling released the latest numbers on Monday saying that Sanford was trailing Mrs Colbert Busch by nine points, with the Democrat winning 50 per cent to the Republican’s 41 per cent. The poll was conducted between April 19 and 21, two days after the wave of bad news hit the Sanford campaign. 'Elizabeth Colbert Busch is now looking like a clear favorite in the special election,' the poll reads. 'The only question is whether an extremely unpopular Sanford can find some way to make voters like her even less than him in the next two weeks.'","Mark Sanford released a lengthy ad in a local newspaper explaining how he broke the rules of his divorce to watch the Super Bowl with his son .

Law change: Maryland Governor Martin O'Malley signs a bill abolishing capital punishment in the state during a ceremony in Annapolis . Maryland has become the 18th U.S. state to abolish the death penalty after Governor Martin O'Malley signed a bill outlawing capital punishment in the state. O'Malley, a Democrat mentioned as a potential presidential candidate in 2016, had pledged to sign the bill, which the Democrat-controlled legislature passed in March. The law replaces capital punishment with a sentence of life without parole. 'With the legislation signed today, Maryland has effectively eliminated a policy that is proven not to work,' O'Malley's office said in a statement. The governor's office said the death penalty does not deter crime, cannot be administered without racial bias and costs three times as much as life without parole. A mistake cannot be reversed if an innocent person is put to death, the statement added. Five other states - Connecticut, Illinois, New Mexico, New York and New Jersey - have repealed capital punishment since 2007, according to the Death Penalty Information Center. 'That's six states in six years,' said Richard Dieter, the Center's executive director. Since Maryland reinstated the death penalty in 1978, 58 people have been sentenced to death in the state, but only five sentences have been carried out. Maryland has five men on death row, and its last execution took place in 2005. The number of U.S. executions has fallen from a peak of 98 in 1999 to 43 each in 2011 and 2012, according to the Death Penalty Information Center. The pace has slowed even more in 2013, with 10 so far this year. Texas has by far the highest number of executions since the U.S. Supreme Court restored the death penalty in 1976, at 496, according to the center. It is trailed by Virginia at 110. Dieter said the death penalty had fallen out of favor largely because lawmakers and the public more and more feared that innocent people could be executed. He noted that lengthy legal appeals made it an expensive proposition. 'It all adds up (as) a costly and rarely used punishment,' he said. Kent Scheidegger, a death penalty advocate and legal director of the Criminal Justice Legal Foundation in Sacramento, California, said some crimes, such as last month's bombings at the Boston Marathon, justified the punishment. A placard displaying the number of the bill abolishing capital punishment in Maryland . 'The main reason is just simple justice,' said Scheidegger. 'There are some crimes where a lesser penalty is insufficient.' He added that capital punishment could act as a deterrent to crime when correctly applied. Multiple states had bills pending to abolish the death penalty but it was unclear which might be the next to overturn it, Dieter said. Among possible contenders is Nebraska, where the single-chamber legislature turned down a repeal bill in March by one vote. The Florida Senate this week moved to speed up executions by sending to Governor Rick Scott reforms designed to keep condemned inmates from spending decades on death row. O'Malley, a former Baltimore mayor and prosecutor, succeeded in his second attempt since 2009 to overturn capital punishment. It is part of a series of socially liberal measures he has championed in Maryland, including gun control, same-sex marriage and letting undocumented immigrants pay in-state tuition at state colleges. Ted Sheckels, a political analyst at Virginia's Randolph-Macon College, said O'Malley's progressive stance, including the death penalty repeal, could help him if he decides to run for president in 2016. 'There have been a number of things that position him on the liberal side of things, which in a Democratic primary is where you want to be,' he said.","Governor Martin O'Malley signs bill outlawing capital punishment in the state .

Researchers believe they have found a family crypt belonging to the Knight recently found buried under an Edinburgh car park. Seven full and one partial skeleton have been found, including an adult female and infant skeleton, just yards from the area the Knight was discovered earlier this year. Archaeologists believe this could be the remains of a family crypt, and say the may find more human remains. An adult female and infant skeleton, which researchers believe may be part of a family crypt at the site . The discoveries were all made under a car park that was formerly that of the 13th century Blackfriar¿s Monastery and later the the sixteenth century Old High School and seventeenth century Royal High School . Ross Murray, the archaeologist who is leading the dig, said 'This site just keeps getting more and more interesting, it is turning out to be a real treasure trove of archaeology. 'We just can’t seem to stop finding skeletons and bones. 'These new finds looks likely to be the possible relations of the suspected Medieval Knight we found earlier this year. 'The skull of the skeleton found immediately beneath the location of the Knight looks like that of a female and the remains found on the other side of the ornate slab belong to an infant from the same period.' The discoveries were all made under a . car park on the building site of the new Edinburgh Centre for Carbon . Innovation (ECCI) building in the Old Town of Edinburgh. The site was . formerly that of the 13th century Blackfriar’s Monastery and later the . the sixteenth century Old High School and seventeenth century Royal High . School. Excavation will continue on the site for at least another two weeks with the ‘skeleton count’ already in double figures. The finds comes just weeks after the . first body, believed to be a knight, was found near the foundations of a . 13th century monastery. In life, he would have been among the social elite, a man of honour and privilege befitting his warrior status. But, . in death, it seems the Scottish knight was destined to suffer the same . indignity as King Richard III – being buried on a site that was to be . later covered by a car park. Only . months after the king’s 500-year-old corpse was found in . Leicestershire, the grave of a medieval knight was uncovered in . Edinburgh. The researchers say they expect to discover more graves at the site . Archaeologists believe this could be the remains of a family crypt, and say they may find more human remains . Workers were taken aback when they came across a sandstone slab decorated with elaborate carvings of a cross and a sword. They called in archaeologists, who found a man's skeleton beneath the stone. The inscription on the gravestone signifies the skeleton is that of a knight. The knight's skeleton and teeth are in good condition and have been removed by forensic experts, who will examine them in an attempt to find out as much as they can about his life and death. Seven full and one partial skeleton have been found, including an adult female and infant skeleton, right, were found just yards from the area the Knight was discovered earlier this year . Warrior: The bones of a medieval knight have been discovered under an old city car park in Edinburgh . The site where the knight was found was once a 13th-century Blackfriars Monastery founded by King Alexander II of Scotland, but was destroyed during the Protestant Reformation in 1558. Archaelologists say the knight would have paid a toll to the local monastery over the course of his life to make sure he was buried in religious grounds. This is not the first time that . archaeologists have excavated in the area. The sites of the 18th- . century Old High School and the 16th-century Royal High School were . found only yards from the knight’s grave. Astonished by his unexpected . discovery, Ross Murray of Headland Archaeology, who studied at a . University of Edinburgh building yards from where the knight was buried, . said: ‘We obviously knew the history of the High School Yards site . while we were studying here. 'But I never imagined I would be back here . to make such an incredible discovery. ‘We . used to take breaks between classes just a few feet away from the . building’s doorway - and all the time the grave was lying under the car . park.’ The car park in the Old Town was being demolished to make way for the Edinburgh Centre for Carbon Innovation (ECCI). Discovery: Archaeologist Ross Murray at the grave which was discovered near the remaining foundations of a monastery built during the reign of King Alexander II of Scotland .

ECCI director Andy Kerr said: ‘We always knew that the building retrofit might uncover historical artefacts, given the site’s history – but this knight is an extraordinary and exciting find. ‘We want our new building to play a key role in shaping Scotland’s future, as these historical buildings on this site did in their time.’ Richard Lewis, culture convener for the City of Edinburgh Council said: 'This find has the potential to be one of the most significant and exciting archaeological discoveries in the city for many years, providing us with yet more clues as to what life was like in medieval Edinburgh '.

The man, in his 80s, was admitted to a Priory clinic for treatment for acute stress after being told of the allegations against him. The children’s TV presenter, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was interviewed last month under caution as part of Scotland Yard’s Operation Yewtree. It is understood that medical staff at the £7,000-a-week clinic are watching him around the clock over fears he may harm or kill himself.

Luis Suarez is facing a ban that is set to run into next season after the Liverpool striker was charged by the FA for his outrageous bite on Branislav Ivanovic. The Liverpool striker was charged with violent conduct at the end  a dramatic day during which  Hillsborough campaigner Margaret Aspinall admitted she was torn  over the gesture by Suarez of  donating his fine to the families of the 96 victims. Suarez, who was fined an  undisclosed amount by Liverpool yesterday, will discover his fate tomorrow when a three-man  Independent Regulatory Committee sits to hear his case. Nobody from Liverpool or the FA will be present. Scroll down to watch video footage of the incident and Ayre's interview . Stunned: Branislav Ivanovic couldn't believe Luis Saurez had attempted to bite him on the arm . The FA felt a mandatory three-match ban . would not be sufficient punishment for this offence and it is likely he . will receive a suspension similar to the seven games he served during . his time at Ajax, when he bit PSV Eindhoven’s Otman Bakkal. Suarez has accepted his financial punishment from Liverpool and asked . for the money — thought to be more than £200,000 — to be donated to the . Hillsborough  Families Support Group for the ‘inconvenience I have . created to the  Liverpool fans and Ivanovic’. While acknowledging Suarez was attempting to do the right thing, . Aspinall — the chairwoman of the HFSG, whose fight for justice has been . characterised by respect and dignity — admitted the incident during . Sunday’s 2-2 draw was ‘awful’. ‘I would rather not be accepting the fine from Luis Suarez because I . would rather he had not bitten that player,’ said Aspinall, who stressed . she did not consider turning down the donation. ‘It is a nice gesture . but it is a terrible thing under the circumstances. Speaking out: Prime Minister David Cameron said the FA need to take a hard line . Disbelief: The Chelsea defender didn't seem to know how to react after he was bitten by Suarez yesterday . ‘We can’t say we are grateful because we would rather him not have done . that at all. It is an awful thing at any time — not just this particular . week. It is nice to know he knows he has let himself, the club, the . fans and the (Hillsborough) families down. ‘We could refuse to accept it but it is going to have to go to someone, . and he wants to show respect and remorse to the families.’ Suarez has been genuinely  contrite following the latest  disgraceful . episode of his career and the PFA, who said it would be ‘embarrassing’ if he were named Player of the Year next Sunday, have offered to help . with improving his behaviour. He will receive the same help at Anfield. Liverpool employ top . psychologist Dr Steve Peters, who is credited with playing an . instrumental role in transforming the fortunes of British cycling. VIDEO   Liverpool's Managing Director on Suarez controversy . Liverpool managing director Ian Ayre insisted Suarez would not be sold. The Uruguay international has been warned, though, that there will be no . way back should he step out of line again. In an interview on the club’s  television station, Ayre said: ‘It . affects his future in the sense that we have to work with him on his . discipline. But Luis is a very important player to the club. He’s a very . popular player with his team-mates. ‘As we keep saying, he signed a new four-year contract last summer and . we’d all love to see him here throughout that contract.  He’s a . fantastic player, top scorer and everything we’d want in a striker, so . there’s no change there. ‘This is more about getting him back on the right track and it’s largely . down to Brendan  (Rodgers) now to work with him on that side of his . character. The most important thing is that we acted swiftly. Out and about: A sombre-looking Suarez is pictured in Liverpool on Monday morning . ‘Luis issued his apology and then we spoke with him last night and then . again this morning. We’ve taken action to fine Luis for his actions.’ Liverpool, however, have received criticism for not issuing their own . suspension and for leaving it to the FA to deal with the incident. Yet some Liverpool fans will believe that for Suarez to face such a big . ban is unjust, given what happened to Tottenham’s Jermain Defoe in 2006 . when he bit Javier Mascherano. Since that incident, though, the FA have . completely changed their rule book and had that incident occurred now, . Defoe — who was booked during that game against West Ham — would have . been charged again, given the exceptional circumstances. There has been no hiding place for Suarez in the last 24 hours and his . personal sponsors, adidas, issued a strongly worded statement to condemn . an incident that has left the game stunned. Confrontation: The Chelsea star made no secret of his unhappiness over the incident with the Liverpool man . Asked what action David Cameron thought should be taken against Suarez, the Prime Minister's official spokesman said: 'It is rightly a matter for the football authorities to consider. 'As part of their consideration, I think it would be very understandable if they took into account the fact that high-profile players are often role models.' It read: ‘adidas takes this type of incident very seriously and does not . condone Luis Suarez’s behaviour. We will be reminding him of the . standards we expect from our players. ‘Luis has admitted his actions were unacceptable and we  support the way Liverpool are planning to handle the situation.’ Liverpool’s sponsors, Standard Chartered, also issued a statement, . saying: ‘LFC have clearly stated that this is unacceptable behaviour and . Luis Suarez has apologised for the incident. We feel the club has dealt . with  this issue appropriately and swiftly.’ Such has been the rumpus that even Downing Street became involved, with . the Prime Minister’s official spokesman saying: ‘It is rightly a matter . for the football authorities to consider. Look, ref: Ivanovic shows his arm to referee Kevin Friend following the biting incident at Anfield yesterday . ‘As part of their consideration,  I think it would be very . understandable if they took into account the fact that high-profile . players are often role models.’ Players’ union boss Gordon  Taylor added:  ‘I think we have to work on . the positive side of things. We’ve got a lad here who is an extremely . good player, one of the world’s best, and he is letting  himself, the . club and the game down by his actions. The PFA chief executive added: ‘While it’s good he made a personal . apology, we have got to work really hard with him and I  hope the club . agree on this anger management business to avoid it happening again and . setting the worst possible example.’ Previous: Suarez bites Otman Bakkal of PSV while playing for Ajax . Repeat? The PSV star was as perplexed as Ivanovic by Suarez's behaviour . Liverpool forward Luis Suarez is back in the spotlight after appearing to bite Chelsea defender Branislav Ivanovic on the arm during the 2-2 draw with Chelsea at Anfield, going on to score a late equaliser. Here are some of the previous controversies surrounding the Uruguayan forward. February 2007: Suarez made his international debut for Uruguay against Colombia but was sent off in the final minutes after being shown a second yellow card for dissent. November 2007: Joined Ajax from Uruguayan side Nacional but he was later suspended by the Dutch giants after a half-time dressing-room altercation with team-mate Albert Luque. July 2010: During the 2010 World Cup quarter-finals, Suarez prevented Ghana's Dominic Adiyiah from scoring in the final minute with a deliberate handball on the line and was subsequently sent off.

Thousands of students descended on a Cambridge park to celebrate an annual drinking party, despite being warned by their university colleges. An estimated 2,000 Cambridge University students took part in the ‘Caesarian Sunday’ tradition, playing boozy games and enjoying semi-dressed antics in front of shocked families on Jesus Green. A number of colleges emailed students last week urging them to ‘find a more fruitful way’ of spending their day than heading to the city centre park for the annual gathering. Geared up: Cambridge University students attend the annual Caesarian Sunday on Jesus Green in the city centre . They warned that any students ‘committing an offence’ would be subject to the disciplinary rules of their respective college and the University and to ‘appropriate police action’. Caesarian Sunday is seen as the birth of the drinking parties for the summer term which ends with the notorious after-exams party, Suicide Sunday, in June. With the sun out for the day, students started filling up the park at around midday wearing their university blazers and carrying bucket loads of alcohol. An afternoon of drinking games followed, including, wrestling and undergraduates at the prestigious institution soaking each other with water pistols and bottles of wine just feet away from where children were playing. The dress code depended on allegiance, with some drinking societies wearing Red Indian headdresses, while others wore blazers or togas. Carry on: As the afternoon went on the boozy games began on the green . Here come the girls: A group of female students play up for the camera as they enjoy the annual event, traditionally held on the first May bank holiday Sunday . Lads: Tourists and locals, including many with children, were subjected to views of students fighting, stripping off and lathering on the sun cream . A lot of the students, both male and female, could barely stand by the end of the afternoon and some hurled abuse at press photographers. Caesarian Sunday historically takes place at Jesus Green in Cambridge’s city centre, on the first bank holiday of the summer term. It is said to have started when a member of the Girton College’s Green Giants stole a bottle of Pimm’s from a member of the Jesus College Caesarians. The bottle was then thrown at the Caesarian in a challenge to fight. It is now tradition that the president of Girton’s drinking society downs a bottle of Pimm’s and invites the Jesus College drinking society to fight. But this year for the first time in 80 years the traditional fight did not take place after students were warned by their colleges to behave. Giddy-up! Members of a Cambridge drinking society take some female students for a ride . Cream on: Two young men take part in a drinking game which involves smearing whipped cream on their bodies and other participants removing it with their mouths . Enjoying the sun: The warm weather allowed for drinking until late in the afternoon - for those still able . Professors at Jesus College had even tried to persuade the drinking societies to hold their traditional bash on its grounds, away from the public eye. But their attempts failed because the undergraduates said they did not want to drink under supervision. Last week Anthony Bowen, a Jesus fellow and a former University Orator, said last year's event was ‘deeply regrettable and embarrassing’ and ‘very unhelpful to the university’. ‘It's disappointing the fight couldn't go ahead as it happens every year, but both Girton and Jesus drinking societies were warned to keep things under control this year,’ said one student who did not want to be named. ‘There was an opportunity to have the event on university grounds but many felt it wouldn't be the same. ‘This is the last day we have to relax before revision and exams, so it's a chance to let off steam.’","Cambridge students defy University's request and enjoy Caesarian Sunday .

Education chiefs say the growing trend of parents hiring private tutors to coach their children through the 11-plus is giving an unfair advantage to middle-class pupils. Kent County Council wants to introduce a new 'tutor-proof' version of the exam designed to stop the children of more affluent parents dominating the intake at the county's top selective schools. The authority conducted a review amid concerns the exam was too 'coachable', meaning clever children from working-class families were being squeezed out. Advantage: The children of middle-class parents who can afford to pay for private tuition have an unfair advantage, education chiefs have said . Youngsters in Kent who pass the exam, . which they sit in their final year of primary school, have the option . of applying to attend one of the county's many selective, grammar . schools. Grammar schools - of which there are more than 30 in Kent - are among the best in . the country but do not charge fees. This is in contrast to independent schools, the . most prestigious of which charge annual fees of up to £30,000. The 11-plus is designed to test . pupils' innate ability, but research has shown 28 per cent of parents . across the country hire a home tutor for their child, according to a . report in The Times. In London and the South East the . figure rose to 35 per cent, with parents spending an average £3,800 per . child per year on private tuition. Concerns: Kent County Council wants to see a test that is less 'coachable' than the current 11-plus . Kent County Council's education spokesman Mike Whiting told the newspaper local headteachers had expressed concerns about the 11-plus, which is administered by the authority. 'I would like to see a test that is less coachable than the current one,' he said. 'It doesn't seem right that those who can afford to have their children coached can gain an advantage in a test over those less well off.' Mr Whiting said the council was preparing to consult further with head teachers, with a view to introducing a new scheme by 2014. But critics said the notion of a 'tutor-proof' test was almost impossible, and questioned the likelihood of developing an exam for which there could be no coaching.","Education chiefs in Kent fear use of home tutors gives an unfair advantage to middle-classes .

A wealthy Russian oligarch has lost a bitter legal battle against his ex-wife to win a 50 per cent share of her £40million London home. Vladimir Slutsker has been involved in a lengthy court fight to gain what he claimed was his share of the house he and Olga Slutsker bought in The Boltons, South Kensington, through an offshore trust account in 2000. The pair bought the home in the capital's second most expensive street for just £6million and spent another £1.5million converting it from four luxury apartments to a lavish family home. Legal battle: Vladimir and Olga Slutsker have been embroiled in a lengthy High Court row over the right to her £40million London mansion . But despite the value of the property . rocketing in the ensuing decade leading up to the couple's acrimonious . divorce, Mr Slutsker will not see a penny of the pair's investment. A . High Court ruling emphasised that the super-rich must live with . the consequences if they choose to own their homes through offshore . trusts. Successful investor . and former Russian politician Mr Slutsker and his wife, who set up a . chain of exclusive health clubs in her native country, bought the house . when Mrs Slutsker wished to relocate to London to give 14-year-old son . Misha a top-class English education. The . investment vehicle, owned by a Cayman Island's trust - dubbed the . 'Misha trust' after their son - is said to have been set up for the . benefit of the couple and their children. Mrs . Slutsker lived at the house with her son and her husband was a regular . visitor with the pair having another child, Anna, in 2003. But battle lines were drawn over ownership of the house when the couple divorced in 2009. Mrs . Slutsker - who was named as 'settlor' of the trust - exercised her . right to get her husband excluded as a beneficiary so that he had no . interest at all in the house. Exclusive district: The value of the property rocketed after the couple bought the South Kensington house in 2000 . But Mr Slutsker has fought his . ex-wife’s move every inch of the way, insisting that he is entitled to a . half-share of the property. He has also launched proceedings in the . Cayman Islands in which he is seeking reinstatement as a beneficiary of . the trust. Under Russian . family law, he insisted that - regardless of the trust - he should be . recognised as 50 per cent beneficial owner of the house as the couple’s . joint money had been used to buy it. However, . dismissing his pleas, Lord Justice Lloyd said that Mr Slutsker had . consented to the creation of the trust with his eyes open and was bound . to suffer the consequences. The judge, sitting with Lord Justice . Patten and Lady Justice Black, acknowledged that Mr Slutsker did not . know the finer details of the trust and did not realise that his rights . as a beneficiary could be 'extinguished' on his wife’s say-so. Hearing: A ruling at the High Court today emphasised that the super-rich must live with the consequences of buying property through overseas trust funds . But he was aware that the house was being bought through a trust and that the ownership structure was inconsistent with straightforward Russian law principles of joint family property. He knew enough about what was happening to give his 'effective consent' to it, the judge ruled. Ruling that Mr Slutsker’s arguments were simply ‘wrong’ under both English and Russian law, the judge said he had in any event left it too late to challenge the ownership structure. After an earlier hearing in the dispute, High Court judge, Mr Justice Underhill, accepted that Mr Slutsker’s exclusion from any interest in the house 'may seem harsh', as much of the money used to buy it having been generated from his business. However, he said it had never been Mr Slutsker’s intention to use the house as his primary home and his ex-wife’s continued occupation of the house, with their children, was consistent with the former couple’s intentions at the time of the purchase.","Vladimir and Olga Slutsker bought the South Kensington home in 2000 .

A couple who sued a hospital for not telling them their unborn child has Down's syndrome has been awarded a $2.9million payout. Ariel and Deborah Levy, who say they would have had an abortion if they had known the child would be disabled, claimed they needed the money to pay for their daughter Kalanit's lifelong care. And a jury agreed, deciding on Friday that Oregon's Legacy Health hospital had been negligent in failing to diagnose the condition in a pre-natal scan. The hospital is considering appealing the verdict, but the Levys' lawyer urged them to 'let this case finally come to an end'. Happy: Kalanit Levy, pictured with her brothers, was born with Down Syndrome after a botched prenatal test failed to spot the condition . The couple from Portland, who have . two other children, said in a lawsuit they would have aborted their . daughter Kalanit - who is now four - if they had known she had Down's . syndrome. Although they say they love Kalanit . and treat her the same as their other children, the Levys demanded a . huge payout from the hospital to pay for the extra medical care she . requires. They accused the hospital of being . 'negligent in their performance, analysis and reporting' after . misreading Mrs Levy's ultrasound scan. Their lawyer David Miller said the parents had launched their lawsuit in an effort to care for Kalanit better. 'These are parents who love this . little girl very, very much,' he said. 'Their mission since the . beginning was to provide for her and that's what this is all about.' After the jury awarded the couple $2.9million, a spokesman for Legacy said the organisation disputed the decision. 'While Legacy Health has great respect for the judicial process, we are disappointed in today's verdict,' he said. 'The legal team from Legacy Health will be reviewing the record and considering available options.' But Mr Miller said: 'I would hope that Legacy would embrace this jury verdict and let this case finally come to an end.' Parents: Ariel, left, and Deborah Levy, right, claim they have received death threats for their comments . Sued: The Levys sued Legacy Health for $3 million as they believe staff botched their prenatal test . The case could have far-reaching - and questionable - implications for children born with with conditions such as Down's. There . are fewer than 10 'wrongful birth' cases in the U.S. every year as . prenatal tests are 99.7 per cent accurate - and few parents want to face . a legal challenge if they do fail, the Oregonian reported. Yet . experts believe there could be a boom in the lawsuits as women in their . late 30s and 40s are increasingly having babies and relying on genetic . screenings to signal problems, the paper added. Civil engineer Ariel and . dental hygienist Deborah, who say they love Kalanit and intend to give her the same opportunities they have given their sons, were stunned when hospital staff told them she appeared to have Down's. Tests carried out before a baby is born to determine whether they have any genetic disorders is called chorionic villus sampling, or CVS for short. It usually takes place between the 10th and 12th week of a pregnancy,. The test is not given to every expectant mother, but some factors give rise to it. It is carried out if a woman has abnormal screen results in the first trimester of her pregnancy, or if there is a family history of genetic disorders or chromosome abnormalities. Women over the age of 35 are also encouraged to have the test, as there is an increased risk of Down syndrome. It involves taking tissue from the foetus while in the womb and screening this sample for abnormalities. Deborah Levy, 39, told doctors she had taken a test - a chorionic villus sampling, or CVS for short - before the birth and that the results had showed their child would be normal. 'We were told we had nothing to worry about,' Ariel Levy told jurors. But days after Kalanit was born, her . mother was taking her to the doctor 'to show her off' and he delivered . the blow - a blood test confirmed the baby had Down's. 'It was . devastating,' Mrs Levy said. Mr Miller claimed in the case that Dr Thomas Jenkins removed tissue in . the womb from Mrs Levy, rather than from the baby, when he carried out . the procedure at the clinic. The suit points the blame at the doctor . and lab workers who did not realise they were testing maternal tissue, . the Oregonian reported. It also suggests that two later ultrasounds carried out by Legacy showed traits of the syndrome, yet staff failed to recognise these, and assured Mrs Levy her baby would be born normal and healthy. Yet the attorneys for the defense claim Jenkins and the staff followed correct procedures. He suggested the problem was that the girl has mosaic Down syndrome. Whereas most people with the condition have cells containing an extra 21st chromosome, a significant number of Kalanit's cells did not, Jenkins said. Nearly 31 per cent were normal. Yet Mr Miller countered that obviously 100 per cent of the cells taken in the CVS test were normal - as they had wrongly been taken from the mother. He added that tests carried out after Kalanit was born show there is less than one or two per cent normal cells. Reports have previously quoted the lawsuit as demanding as much as $14 million to cover the cost of the young girl's care. Legal team: Robert Keating (L) said Kalanit has . mosaic Down's, so fewer cells contain the chromosome associated . with the syndrome. David Miller (R) said the clinic took tissue from the . mother, not the fetus . Decisions: Judge Karin Immergut is presided over the case . The couple has already whipped up a frenzy of . hate and abuse for their comments over aborting their beloved daughter. Miller said they have received death threats. The couple met in preschool, attended the same high school and college and married in 2000. Civil engineer Ariel and . dental hygienist Deborah, both 39, are orthodox Jewish, according to Facebook. Their sons are in third grade and . kindergarten. The boys, shown hugging their younger sister tightly in . photographs, are bright - one has placed in the 99th percentile on . standardised tests. The third pregnancy, when Mrs Levy was 34, was a 'surprise', according to the Oregon paper. Due to her age, the couple was vigilant about testing, undergoing the CVS at 13 weeks. It is believed one in 250 women at that age give birth to a child with Down syndrome. Studies suggest that more than 89 per cent of women choose to abort a fetus with Down syndrome. After their daughter was born with the syndrome, the Levys expressed their fears over her future, including medical and social issues, and whether she would get the required educational support. Experts have told them she will probably not be able to live on her own or support herself, the Oregonian reported. It is estimated she will live until her mid-50s. She is able to speak in two-word sentences which only her parents and a few others understand, according to the Oregonian. Yet the Levys say Karen Gaffney, who has Down syndrome and earned a Portland Community College degree, is a role model for their child.","A prenatal test showed couple's daughter would be 'normal and healthy'

Nearly half of people in the UK still don't understand how HIV is contracted, according to a charity. A survey of 12,000 people found that 46 per cent wrongly think you can get HIV from unusual means such as being spat at, the National Aids Trust said. 'We often read stories in the media about people having to take HIV tests after being spat at, bit or stepping on a needle in a park, however the risk from these activities is either non-existent or incredibly low,' said charity chief executive Deborah Jack. Reality: 95 per cent of HIV cases are contracted via unsafe sex . 'Misinformation about how you can contract HIV leads to anxiety and feeds stigma and discrimination towards people living with the disease. 'This stigma can be incredibly damaging. It is also an immense distraction from the overwhelming risk factor for HIV in the UK - unsafe sex.' The data revealed only four out of 10 people knew that 95 per cent of HIV infections in the UK are due to unprotected sex. Others ways of getting HIV are from sharing contaminated needles or between an infected mother and her baby at birth or via breastfeeding. The survey also discovered the public think HIV was a bigger problem in . the 80s and 90s than in the present day. Half assumed the highest number of gay men diagnosed with HIV in a year was in the 80s or 90s - actually it was in 2011. The number of new HIV cases in the UK has soared over the past 10 years . Ms Jack added: 'It is a common misconception that HIV is a . problem of the past. In fact the number of people living with HIV in the . UK hit 96,000 in 2011, with 6,280 new diagnoses that year. 'As a matter of urgency the Government needs to put resources behind . educating people that HIV hasn’t gone away, it is more prevalent than . ever and safer sex is vital to reduce HIV transmission.' The survey was released to mark STiQ Day - which encourages people to think about their sexual health. There is currently no cure for HIV, however treatments are far more effective at enabling people with the virus to lead a more normal life. As a result someone diagnosed with HIV in their 30s can now expect to live into their 70s. Medication, known as antiretrovirals, works by slowing down the damage the virus does to the immune system. It prevents HIV from progressing into AIDS when the immune system stops working, leaving sufferers prey to life-threatening illnesses.","Misconceptions about HIV 'feed discrimination about the disease'

Germany's Catholic Church will deny worshippers the right to Holy Communion and religious burials if people do not pay a special church tax. A newly-enforced German bishops' decree says anyone failing to pay the tax - an extra 8% of their income tax bill - will no longer be considered a Catholic. All people in Germany must pay this tax if they want to worship in either Catholic or protestant churches, or Jewish synagogues. Worshippers in Germany will be no longer considered Catholic if they do not pay the special church tax . Last year millions of files spanning decades were handed over to criminal investigators by all 27 dioceses of the Catholic Church hierarchy in Germany in a bid to get to the heart of child sex abuse by priests. It was seen as an attempt to staunch the flow of leavers who made it plain the scandal, and the inability or unwillingness to deal with it, was the reason for their departure. In 2010, 181,000 people left, an increase of 50 percent on the previous year. Last year 126,000 left. Over the past twenty years, the number of members of Germany’s Roman Catholic Church has fallen from 28.3 million to 24.6 million or 30.2 percent of the country’s population. The Catholic Church has seen numbers fall in recent years, particularly in Germany . Many parishioners said they were sickened that offending clergy were often simply moved to new jons where they were free to commit more crimes. Now comes the new hardline from the church which is also partly in response to a test case that has been griding through the courts and due for a decision by a court in Leipzig on Friday. This concerns Professor Hartmut Zapp, . who announced in 2007 that he would no longer pay the tax but intended . to remain within the Catholic faith. With the new order, endorsed by the . Vatican, the German Bishops' Conference last week declared; 'This . decree makes clear that one cannot partly leave the Church.' Couples . can receive an exemption to be married in the church, as long as they . pledge to maintain their faith and raise their children as Catholics. But the powers that be can deny church tax dodgers a Catholic burial 'if . the person who has left the church has not shown any sign of remorse . before death.' Though the . bishops’ text avoids the word 'excommunication,' the consequences of the . all-or-nothing rule are essentially one and the same. Unless they pay the religious tax, Catholics will now no longer be allowed receive sacraments, except before death, or work in the church and its schools or hospitals. 'Without a sign of repentance before death, a religious burial can be refused,' the decree states. Opting out of the tax would also bar people from acting as godparents to Catholic children. German-born Pope Benedict XVI helped formulate the controversial policy . It is understood German-born Pope Benedict XVI helped formulate the policy after his visit to Germany in the autumn of last year did little in the way of causing a mass return to the fold by people who had left. The diocese that recorded the highest member loss in 2010, was Munich and Freising — the pope’s former diocese — where 21,600 people alone left the church. The Archbishop of Munich and Freising, Cardinal Reinhard Marx, begged forgiveness for 'everything those working for the church have done' as he presented a report that showed more-than 250 priests and religion teachers sexually or physically abused children in the diocese over the past decades. 'We want to learn from our bad mistakes and misconduct of the past,' Marx then vowed. In its response to the abuse scandal, Germany’s Bishops Conference has publicly and repeatedly showed remorse, changed the relevant guidelines for the clergy and offered up to euro5,000 compensation to victims of abuse by clergy or church officials while they were minors, but it gave no total number of victims. Austria, which taxes church members in a way similar to those in Germany also saw a significant drop in the number of departures. Figures published by the Austrian Bishop’s Conference earlier this year said 87,000 Austrian Catholics left in 2010, a 64 percent increase over the 53,000 who formally had their names struck from church registries in 2009. But Catholics are questioning whether the decree for worshippers to put their money where their faith is is the best way forward. 'This decree at this moment of time is really the wrong signal by the German bishops who know that the Catholic church is in a deep crisis,' said Christian Weisner from the grassroots Catholic campaign group We are Church. The church did itself no favours among the population earlier this year when the Bishop of Trier Stephen Ackermann, the church official responsible for dealing with the sex abuse scandal, stated; 'There should not be a blanket ban from employing priests who have committed sexual crimes.' 'There are a number of motives,' Ackermann said. 'It made sense to differentiate among the different types of offenders. Otherwise we could slide into a dynamic that calls for all of them to be imprisoned.' Newspapers and radio stations were inundated ´with calls from parents angry at his suggestion. Hefty criticism also came from Friedhelm Hengsbach, a theologian who specialises in social ethics. He said: 'The church's structures are crusty, old and full of rust, moths and mildew.' Hengsbach said the church hierarchy tried to prevent reform.",Worshippers must pay extra 8% on income tax bill to still be considered Catholics .

Beautiful, talented and immensely successful, American photographer Lee Miller was the fashion muse turned war correspondent who fired the imagination of generations of photographers. Famous for her harrowing images documenting the horrors of World War Two, her photo-journalistic work for Vogue included striking shots of the skeletal inmates of Dachau and Buchenwald concentration camps as well as portraits of the men fighting in the US army. But following the war, and although dogged by post-traumatic stress disorder, Miller began a new career documenting some of the leading lights of the art world. Scroll down for video .

Art set: Lee Miller and her husband Sir Roland Penrose were leading lights of the post-war creative crowd . Now, the Lee Miller archive has released a batch of never-before-seen images that include some of the greats of modern art, including intimate shots of Joan Miró relaxing with a python at London Zoo and Jean Cocteau lighting a fellow diner’s cigarette during a supper in Paris. A leading light of the 1950’s art set, Miller’s post-war career produced some of the most iconic images of artists such as Picasso, Henry Moore and Eileen Agar available today. But the new images display an altogether softer side of her personality, and show why the celebrated war photographer’s home became such a Mecca for artists during the 50s and 60s. Among regular visitors to Farley Farm House in Sussex were Picasso, Man Ray, Henry Moore, Eileen Agar, Jean Dubuffet, Dorothea Tanning, and Max Ernst. During this period, Miller also produced photographs for her husband Roland Penrose’s biographies of Picasso and the Spanish sculptor and painter, Antoni Tàpies.

Many of these works can be seen in the Lee Miller archive, which consists of more than 60,000 original negatives, 20,000 prints and contact sheets, and thousands of original documents and manuscripts. Set up by Miller’s only son, Anthony Penrose to preserve and collate her work, in the wake of her death in 1977, many of the photos contained in the archive can now be seen online, thanks to Penrose’s newly relaunched website which includes a library containing 3,000 of Miller’s works. More of her work can be seen at Farley Farm House, where the photographer spent her later years and launched her third career – this time as a gourmet cook. The house, and Miller’s beloved herb garden, is to be opened to the public every Sunday between April and October. The Penrose family, who still own the property, have also converted one of the barns into a gallery which will champion new artistic talent, just as Miller and Penrose did half a century ago.

She and Jim were both jailed after he failed to pass a sobriety test, and Reese has now pulled out of a scheduled appearance on Jimmy Fallon on Tuesday to save face. Regrets: Jim Toth 'feels awful' for involving Reese Witherspoon in his DUI incident, it has been reported . While she has issued a publicly apology for her embarrassing behaviour, her CAA agent husband apparently feels just as bad. A source close to Jim told People that he 'feels awful that he involved Reese in the situation.' 'He made a bad decision and it certainly made things worse that he dragged her . into it.' Jim was reported to have blown a .139 on the sobriety test, which is well above the legal limit of 0.08. The source added that Jim 'has to pay the consequences, bottom line. He gets that.' Keeping a low profile: Reese, pictured at the New York screening of her movie Mud on Sunday, has pulled out of a Jimmy Fallon appearance scheduled for Tuesday . 'Jim has always been a big social . drinker,' the source went on. 'A lot of his job is being social. He's . out to lunch or dinner almost every day of the week, schmoozing clients . and taking business meetings.' The insider said: '[The arrest is] . just going to make the two of them stop and pause, and think about maybe . how much Jim's drinking plays a role in their lives – if it does or . not.' According to Late Night With Jimmy Fallon's website Reese will no longer be making an appearance on the show on Tuesday. She was set to appear alongside footballer Eli Manning but her slot is now being filled by comedian Adam Ferrara. Not her best angle: Mugshots of Reese and her Jim were both released on Sunday after the pair were arrested on Friday night . It has also been claimed that the star has been hanging out with Chelsea Handler and Cameron Diaz in the wake of the incident. She was spotted having drinks with . her two famous friends and her husband at the Greenwich hotel on Sunday, . according to Us Weekly. 'Nobody was drunk - it was pretty . tame,' a source told the publication, claiming the group instead sipped . on San Pellegrino water. 'They all seemed really happy.

Jailed: Reese and husband Jim, pictured here in December, were arrested by Atlanta Police, on Friday . According to a police report released on Sunday, Reese was handcuffed and briefly jailed for refusing to obey orders given to her by an officer of the law. Reese, 37, and Toth, 42, were released on bail at 3:30 in the morning on Friday, before which the couple both posed for mugshots. It was initially thought Reese and Jim would be in court on Monday morning in Atlanta, but TMZ reports the couple's cases have been postponed, with Reese's set for May 22 and Jim's for May 23. The family is currently residing in Atlanta to shoot Reese’s new movie The Good Lie. Arrest report: An arrest report listing both Reese and Jim's offenses was also released on Sunday . Detailed: The documents detail how the Oscar winning actress and her beau had a run in with a Georgia State Patrol officer in the early hours of Friday April 19 . Play-by-play: It goes on to explain Reese's play-by-play reaction to her husband's arrest . Toth was apprehended after midnight on Friday for recklessly weaving across Peachtree Street in the city of Atlanta. The police report alleges that the Hollywood agent smelled of alcohol and appeared 'disheveled'. After pulling the DUI suspect over, a sobriety test was conducted in a Walgreens parking lot. Reese is said to have been warned to remain inside her vehicle, while her husband was subjected to the DUI test. Facing the music: The couple's hearings have been postponed, with Reese's set for May 22 and Jim's for May 23 . The officer on the scene claims that the actress became clearly agitated and eventually disobeyed his verbal commands. The officer reported: ‘Mrs. Witherspoon began to hang out the window and say that she did not . believe that I was a real police officer.’ The law enforcer explained in the report: ‘I told Mrs. Witherspoon to sit on her butt and be quiet.’ But . once Toth was handcuffed, the mother-of-three disembarked from her . seat, telling the officer that she was a ‘US citizen’ and that she had . the right to ‘stand on American ground’. Disorderly conduct: Reese was arrested for allegedly disregarding an officer's orders while her husband was handcuffed for failing a sobriety test, the family pictured in Tennessee with their son, in March . The report then described how Reese resisted him as he grabbed her arms to arrest her. Toth is said to have made a verbal attempt to calm his hysterical wife. The . officer’s report further details: ‘Mrs. Witherspoon asked, “Do you know . my name?” I answered, “No, I don’t need to know your name.” I then . added, “right now.” Mrs. Witherspoon stated, “You’re about to find out . who I am.”’ According to the arresting officer: . ‘Mrs. Witherspoon also stated, “You are going to be on national news.” I . advised Mrs. Witherspoon that was fine.’ Tight couple: The famous pair were released on bail early Friday morning, pictured at Cannes Film Festival, in May last year . Toth is said to be facing charges for driving under the influence and failure to stay within his lane while on the road. While Reese’s alleged violation is ‘disorderly conduct (obstruction)', which falls under municipal ordinance. On Sunday Reese issued a statement which said: 'Out of respect for the ongoing legal situation, I cannot comment on everything that is being reported right now. But I do want to say, I clearly had one drink too many and I am deeply embarrassed about the things I said.

Julie Bentley: 'Girls today face real and unique challenges as they grow up - I want our programme to continue responding to those challenges' A leading abortion rights campaigner has been named as the new chief executive of the Girl Guides. Julia Bentley – who for five years  ran the campaign group supporting  abortion rights and sex education –  said that she was delighted at her  appointment to ‘the ultimate feminist organisation’. However, her role at Girlguiding UK has raised eyebrows among some religious  groups and those who are concerned about the premature sexualisation of girls. Under Miss Bentley’s leadership the fpa – formerly known as the Family Planning  Association – sells condom  demonstrators for use by girls as young as 11 and opened an online sex shop sells sex toys and aids to customers of any age, subject only to some users ticking a box to confirm they are over 18. Girlguiding UK yesterday said that girls face challenges growing up and Miss Bentley will ‘ensure guiding continues to meet those challenges head on’. Miss Bentley also insisted that there was no contradiction between her previous  work at the fpa and her appointment to the £85,000-a-year job. ‘I have worked in a wide range of settings and I have a broad insight into what affects girls,’ she said. ‘I don’t think any of this is at odds with the Girl Guides. In fact I believe the Guides is the ultimate feminist organisation.’ The move comes at a time when the movement has been in competition with the Scouts to attract members. Although the female-only Guides have 538,000 members from the age of 11, the Scouts, who have been recruiting girls since the 1970s, have more than 66,000 in their ranks. Confidence: Julie Bentley hopes to encourage young girls to become confident, self-assured women . Miss Bentley’s appointment was criticised by Christian groups and family campaigners last night. They claimed that the campaigner  was an unsuitable figure to run the movement which should provide girls with an alternative to celebrity culture and early sex. Back in the day: A Brownie in 1970s England . Mike Judge, of the Christian Institute think-tank, said: ‘I do not think she is a fitting individual to run the Girl Guides. ‘The Girl Guides is an organisation which should protect girls from these sorts of pressures.’ Jill Kirby, an author and researcher specialising in social policy, said: ‘One of the reasons why girls want to join the Guides, and their parents are happy that they should do so, is that they can learn leadership qualities and escape from the sex and television culture. ‘I would have hoped that anyone leading the Guides would understand that. I don’t believe that Miss  Bentley does.’ The fpa was one of the leading  state-subsidised organisations which, under Tony Blair’s government, attempted to reduce teenage pregnancy rates. Although levels did fall, the  campaign fell far short of its target of halving pregnancies among girls under 18. It is currently selling a condom  demonstrator as part of a catalogue of ‘young people resources aged 11 and above’ alongside sex education leaflets for girls of 12 and over. One booklet, called Sex, Love, Relationships, tells young readers they are ready for sex if they can answer ‘yes’ to four questions. It says: ‘Ask yourself these questions: Do you want to have sex (for you, not for someone else)? Do you like, trust, respect your partner? ‘Are you prepared to take responsibility . for having safer sex? Are  you prepared for the possible  emotional . rollercoaster of rejection  or break-up?’ The way we were: English Girl Guides in Hertfordshire in 1950 . This year the organisation has opened an online shop, Desire And Pleasure, which sells a wide range of sex toys and aids alongside condoms. Items on sale include ‘bondage gear’. Miss Bentley said in an interview with The Times: ‘Everyone has  heard of the Girl Guides but not  everyone understands that today it  is very different. ‘They are rooted to the image of what the Guides were years ago. I want to help the public understand what they Guides are now. ‘It is not about itchy brown uniforms and sewing and baking. It is a  modern, contemporary, vibrant organisation. ‘Guides in 2012 are more likely to be investigating a muddy ravine, going overseas to help on an Aids programme, or going to one of our pop concerts.’ Girlguiding UK is Britain’s largest voluntary organisation for girls and young women, with more than 500,000 members and recognised volunteers. Over a third of girls and young women aged seven to 21  have been involved with the movement, with former Guides including Carol Vorderman and Emma Thompson. There are now 31million Scouts and ten million Guides in 216 countries around the world.The organisation was formed before the First World War following the success of the Boy Scout movement, founded by Robert Baden-Powell. The Boer War hero disapproved of girls and boys mixing freely and so encouraged his sister Agnes to set up a girls-only organisation. It was named after a frontier regiment in the Indian Army.

It was the perilous 18-hour flight which saw Britain's wartime Prime Minister fly back from America while being hunted by the German Luftwaffe. Winston Churchill had flown back across the Atlantic in 1942 after lobbying President Roosevelt over the Allied Forces' strategy against Hitler. And given the flight risks and importance of the discussions, the long-haul voyage back to Britain was one of the most significant of the Second World War. Now a rare family archive has captured the intimate moments of Churchill's flight, including pictures of the wartime leader at the controls of the Boeing Clipper flying boat RAM 'Berwick'. Brave: Churchill sat at the controls of the Boeing 314a Clipper during the 18-hour flight, during which he was also pictured with his trademark cigar . Atlantic crossing: Churchill took an 18-hour flight on the Boeing Clipper flying boat RAM 'Berwick' Flight Officer Ron Buck kept back his own pictures from the trip that was later described as the 'Most Daring Flight of the Whole War.' Churchill had crossed the Atlantic by ship in order to lobby President Roosevelt, but rashly decided to fly home from Bermuda. With some of his most senior colleagues, the Prime Minister embarked on what was to become a perilous 18 hours flight. The photos show Churchill, cigar in mouth, at the controls of the plane, and also at the dinner table, glass in hand. He was the first leader to cross the Atlantic by plane. The Berwick, a Royal Mail Aircraft, had to be lightened in order to have enough fuel for the journey that was still a daring distance at that time. Among those alongside Churchill were the First Sea Lord, Admiral Sur Dudley Pound, Air Chief Marshall Sir Charles Portal and Lord Beaverbrook, Minister for Aircraft production. Time to relax: Churchill also took time to dine on board the plane, while Sir Charles Wilson and Air Chief Marshall Sir Charles Portal (right) were also part of the British war machine on the flight . Flying the 'Berwick' was celebrated pilot Captain John Kelly-Rogers and he had to have his wits about him when the plane went too near the French town of Brest. It was a heavily defended German naval base and a Luftwaffe squadron was scrambled to intercept the plane, but fortunately it couldn't find it. The 'Berwick' flew for the last two hours of the flight with radio silence and ultimately approached England from an unexpectedly southern direction. Churchill later recorded: 'Six Hurricanes from Fighter Command were ordered to shoot us down... but failed in their mission.' Flight Officer Buck was an amateur photographer and this collection has remained in his family for the 70 years since the flight. The archive includes a signed dinner menu from the historic crossing and a cartoon mocking the Luftwaffe because of its failure to shoot down the plane. The menu showed they ate a shrimp cocktail, cold buffet, chicken, ham, beetroot, Bartlett pears with cream followed by coffee. The archive was taken to an antiques roadshow event by Flight Officer Buck's nephew Miles Buck, who lives in the New Zealand, north island town of Tauranga. Archive: A menu card from the flight, as well as a cartoon mocking the Germans' inability to hunt Churchill's place, are also among the collection set to go on sale . It is now being sold by Art and Object in Auckland with an estimate of 23,750 New Zealand dollars - about 12,000 pounds. Hamish Coney, who discovered the archive when it was taken to the roadshow, said: 'This is an incredible archive of pictures that has been kept by the family of Flight Officer Buck. 'His nephew brought them to one of our roadshows and they records the return journey of Churchill in 1942 from his visit to America. 'Pear Harbour had just been bombed and Churchill wanted Roosevelt to focus on Hitler in Europe. 'There was a big chunk of his war machine on board in an unarmed aircraft. It's crazy really. 'There was no radio for the flight and these were huge planes and would have looked like a flying elephant on the radar.'","PM had visited U.S. to lobby Roosevelt on Allied strategy against Hitler .

Raul Sanchez Fuentes Villota can be sent back to Spain despite claiming he had previously been tortured there . A suspected terrorist who spent 17 years on the run can be sent back to Spain despite claiming he had previously been tortured with pencils there, a court ruled today. Raul Sanchez Fuentes Villota, 46, allegedly a member of the separatist group ETA, is wanted over charges linked to a foiled car bomb attack on a police officer in June 1991. He skipped bail in 1995 and was arrested in Liverpool in November last year after a European Arrest Warrant was made in the Spanish courts. He told a hearing last month he was tortured while being held in 'incommunicado' detention by Spanish police in 1991, including having pencils placed between his fingers and squeezed to inflict pain on his hands. His barrister argued at that hearing that the British courts could not be confident that Spain would deal with the torture allegations properly. But District Judge Nicholas Evans, sitting at Westminster Magistrates' Court today, said Spain was a 'trusted extradition partner' and a decision on whether any evidence had been obtained by torture should be left to a court there. He also questioned whether ill-treatment suffered by Fuentes could be deemed ""torture"". Ordering Fuentes be extradited, District Judge Evans said: 'I'm persuaded by such evidence that I have heard that it is more likely than not the requested person (Fuentes) suffered the pencil treatment.

"PUBLISHED: . 10:45 EST, 7 May 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 10:46 EST, 7 May 2013 . Nurse Trevor Madziwa, 34, has been struck off after the Nursing and Midwifery Council heard he was violent to a former patient and held her captive for three hours . A male nurse who had an affair with a former patient before turning violent and holding her captive when she tried to break it off has been struck off. Trevor Madziwa, 34, who met the young woman when he was working at the Priory Clinic in north London, jabbed his thumbs into her eyes and grabbed her around the neck when she tried to leave his flat, a tribunal heard. He pinned the 18-year-old down, took her shoes, handbag and phone, and pulled her tights off during the attack, the Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) heard. The victim feared he was going to strangle her or throw her over the balcony of his flat, and only managed to escape when she kicked Madziwa and grabbed a knife from the kitchen. The NMC tribunal heard that Zimbabwean-born Madziwa had admitted having sex with the woman after sending her Facebook messages when she was transferred from the Priory to another hospital. The young woman, who had a medical history of depression, bulimia and diabetes, had been admitted to the clinic in Southgate where singer Amy Winehouse was once treated, in 2008, the NMC heard. Eight months later she was transferred to another hospital and some time after that, Madziwa began bombarding her with texts, emails and Facebook messages. The panel heard that the pair met in hotels for sex sessions before the relationship began to deteriorate over several months.  It culminated in the incident at Madziwa's flat on November 20, 2011. The NMC hearing was told that the teenager reported the incident to the police but ultimately decided she did not want to press charges. Maurice Cohen, chairman of the panel, said: 'The fact the police took the allegation against Mr Madziwa seriously is noted.' Madziwa, who had already admitted having a sexual relationship with his former patient and preventing her from leaving his flat, later claimed that the woman hacked into his email account to fire off a series of aggressive messages to herself. But Mr Cohen dubbed Madziwa's evidence 'implausible' and 'contradictory' as the NMC misconduct panel found him guilty of verbally and physically abusing the woman while holding her captive. The Priory clinic in Southgate, north London, where nurse Trevor Madziwa met the young woman . Mr Cohen said: 'Mr Madziwa displayed verbally and physically abusive behaviour towards [the alleged victim] and a sanction is needed to meet the public interest. 'It was a serious departure from the relevant standards as set out in the code. 'There is no evidence he has considered the consequences of his actions on [the young woman] or on the profession. 'The panel finds Mr Madziwa has a harmful and deep seated attitudinal problem.  His actions amounted to abuse of his position and power - this was not an isolated incident but occurred over a protracted period of time. 'The panel finds Mr Madziwa's behaviour breaks fundamental tenets of the profession.  A striking-off order is the only sanction that would satisfy the public interest.'","Trevor Madziwa, 34, met the young woman at Priory clinic in north London .

A Scottish holidaymaker has died after suffering a suspected heart attack while scuba diving in Lanzarote. Former paratrooper William Clephane was on a scuba diving course when he got into difficulties while submerged under water and had to be pulled from the sea. Paramedics fought to save the 59-year-old, who was on holiday with his family at the resort of Puerto del Carmen, but they could not revive him and he was pronounced dead at the quayside. Tragedy: William Clephane was on holiday with his family at the resort of Puerto del Carmen, pictured, in Lanzarote when he suffered a suspected heart attack while underwater on a scuba diving course . A Spanish police source said: ‘The initial inquiries all point to him dying as the result of a tragic accident. It appears he became nervous and was waving his arms around and swallowed water.’ Mr Clephane, from Scone, Perthshire, was diving with four other tourists and an instructor when he got into difficulties. The tragedy happened on  Saturday around 10.30am during a ‘discover diving’ course with British-run centre Safari Diving. A spokesman for the centre said Mr Clephane was not a novice and had completed several dives. He refused to comment further until it became more clear what had happened. Relatives were being comforted by friends at Mr Clephane's home. William’s son, who did not give his name, told the Mirror: 'We don’t know exactly what happened yet and we are waiting to find out the results. It’s still very fresh. 'We know he was diving when it happened.' An investigating judge in Spain has been put in charge of a  routine inquiry into Mr Clephane’s death. A post-mortem examination took place over the weekend but the preliminary results have not been made public. At Mr Clephane’s home in Scone yesterday, a man who confirmed he was the dead man’s son said the family was still coming to terms with the tragedy. The man, who did not want to be named, added: ‘We don’t know exactly what happened yet and we are waiting to find out the results.’","William Clephane, 59, was on holiday with his family in Puerto del Carmen .

Daniel Morgan, 37, was found in a pub car park in Sydenham, south London, in 1987 with an axe embedded in his head. His family maintained he was killed by a professional hitman . A notorious unsolved axe murder from a quarter of a century ago is to be investigated by a judge. Theresa May will announce details later this month of an 'independent panel review' into the death of private detective Daniel Morgan. The Home Secretary's panel will have the same powers as the one that reviewed the 1989 Hillsborough tragedy and led to a new criminal investigation. Campaigners hope Mrs May's move will also trigger a new police inquiry and a successful prosecution of those responsible for killing Mr Morgan in a pub car park in Sydenham, south-east London, in 1987. The 37-year-old married father of two was found with the axe embedded in his head. Like the Hillsborough tragedy, the Morgan case has been dogged by allegations of police corruption. The detective's family believe he was . killed because he was about to unveil a web of corruption allegedly . involving his business partner Jonathan Rees and a string of police . officers. Five inquiries – costing an estimated £50million – have failed to crack the case. Last year the Leveson Inquiry into . press standards heard disturbing claims that the News of the World put . the senior detective who led the fourth and fifth investigations into . the Morgan murder under surveillance. Detective Chief Superintendent Dave . Cook and his then wife Jacqui Hames said the suspects for the killing . had encouraged the now defunct tabloid to watch them. Miss Hames told the inquiry she was . being watched because 'suspects in the Daniel Morgan murder inquiry were . using their association with a powerful and well-resourced newspaper to . intimidate us and try to attempt to subvert the investigation'. The fifth inquiry into the murder collapsed in March 2011. Three men charged with the killing – . Mr Rees and his brothers-in-law Garry and Glenn Vian – were cleared of . involvement before their trial started. The 37-year-old married father of two was found with the axe embedded in his head in the car park of the Golden Lion pub in Sydenham, south London, on March 10, 1987 . An Old Bailey judge ruled senior . police had coached one of the supergrasses in the case, and it was . revealed that large amounts of evidence had not been disclosed. The panel judge is expected to appoint experts but will not have the power to call witnesses.

A heroic rescuer who . risked his life by leaping on to an out of control speedboat that killed . a father and daughter was yesterday back on the water working as a watersports instructor. Charlie Toogood, 32, jumped from his own rib into the £60,000 vessel which had thrown the six members of the Milligan . family into the Camel estuary on Sunday - leaving two of them dead and two . severely injured. Officials praised his actions, saying there would certainly have been more fatalities without Mr Toogood's help. The former RNLI volunteer yesterday returned to his day job, back on the waters where the tragedy happened. Back at work: Charlie Toogood, 32, was yesterday back working as a watersports instructor on the waters where he jumped on to an out of control speedboat and cut the engine - preventing further fatalities . Tragedy: The Milligan family, with father Nick holding eight-year-old Emily, left, both of whom lost their lives in the speedboat crash in Padstow on Sunday. Victoria, 41, Kit, four, Olivia, 10, and Amber 12, are in hospital . An onlooker at the Camel Estuary off Padstow, Cornwall, told the Daily Mirror: 'He looked deep in thought and just went about his business. 'Charlie was wearing a life-jacket and . jeans and his route across the estuary took him near the area where he . boarded the empty speedboat as it went round in circles causing such . terrible mayhem. 'But I don’t think he was looking at the scenery – he just seemed to be concentrating on steering the boat across the estuary.' BSkyB boss Nick Milligan, 51, and his daughter Emily, eight, died after being thrown in the water with the rest of their family on Sunday. Hero: Watersports instructor Charlie Toogood brought a runaway speedboat under control in Padstow and saved the lives of four members of a family . The out-of-control speedboat was circling the family, slicing them with its lethal propeller blades. Mr Milligan's yoga teacher wife Victoria, 39, and their son Kit, four, were left with 'life-changing' leg injuries and are still being treated in hospital. The couple's other daughters Olivia, 10, and Amber, 12, were also injured in the water. But Mr Toogood's quick thinking when he first spotted the speedboat was out of control prevented further fatalities. The watersports instructor and a friend sped to the rescue of the boat after seeing them in the sea off Padstow in Cornwall. They drew level with the stricken vessel as it raced round in circles, allowing Mr Toogood to jump into it. He then managed to stop the engine and halt the boat. Mr Toogood was an RNLI crew volunteer at Rock lifeboat station for eight . years - and only finished two years ago because of business commitments. He is a married father of a five-month-old daughter and runs the Camel Ski School, . which rents out equipment for Cornish holidaymakers. He yesterday spoke about the incident for the first time, and said that it was important to remember the those who died or were hurt in the tragedy. 'There were many ""heroes"" in this tragic incident, all of whom did a remarkable job in difficult circumstances,' he said in a statement through the RNLI. 'However, now is a time to solely reflect on the bereaved and injured family members and their wider family and friends. 'My thoughts are with them all and will be for a long time to come. 'I have nothing more to add and would hope that our community can now be . left to deal with this tragedy in own own way and in peace and quiet.' Aftermath: An amateur video showing the empty speedboat out of control at Padstow shortly after the fatal incident . Danger: The boat was completely out of control following the incident in Padstow, Cornwall, on Bank Holiday Sunday . Bravery: The video, filmed from the shore, shows Mr Toogood jumping on to the speedboat . Mr Milligan's brother Nick yesterday said the family was 'as well as can be hoped' in a brief statement outside their London home. 'The investigation is on going. The family is doing as well as they can,' the 53-year-old said. Asked about the condition of Mr Milligan’s wife Victoria and son Kit, Mr Milligan said: 'They are still being treated. 'I’ve seen the children, they’re all doing as well as you can hope for'. He added that 'lots of people have been very understanding' when asked about the support offered to the family. He said he was at his brother’s detached house situated next to Wandsworth Common, 'to handle (his brother’s) affairs'. Instructor: Mr Toogood, 32, intervened to prevent further disaster after the speedboat killed two people . Experienced: Mr Toogood runs his own business hiring out boats to holidaymakers in Cornwall . Mr Toogood's actions are credited with saving the lives of Nick Milligan’s remaining family, with police and coastguards having . praised Mr Toogood’s ‘incredible seamanship and bravery’ which prevented . further tragedy during the horrifying accident. Matt Pavitt, from the North Cornwall Coastguard, said: ‘He managed to manoeuvre his boat alongside the vessel which was going round and round in circles, picked his moment and jumped.’ Detective Superintendent Jim Colwell added: ‘Without the brave and heroic efforts of local people and holidaymakers in the minutes immediately after this incident in assisting the family while they were in the water, I’m confident that this would have been far worse in terms of the overall death toll.’ Mr Toogood, a married father in his early 30s, had previously declined to talk about his heroics but his mother Sarah said he was ‘in a bit of a state’. Another friend added: ‘He is devastated. Everyone is rightly calling  him a hero, but he felt he was helpless that he couldn’t do more to save the others.’ Police at the scene of a boat crash at Padstow harbour where a father and daughter died . Teenager Will Jones was named as the . helmsman of Mr Toogood’s boat. His sister Amy said: ‘My brother is still . very shaken up from it all.’ Hundreds . of holidaymakers watched in horror as the speedboat then raced round in . circles, its propeller slashing the helpless victims and turning the . water 'red with blood'. Mr Jones, 19, later wrote on Facebook: 'After today the next few days are going to be very difficult to process. Thoughts are with those who are involved in the accident.'

An Irish traveller father and his son who forced destitute men to be their slaves were jailed for 13 years today. Tommy Connors Senior, 53, was jailed for eight years and his son Patrick, 21, for five years at Luton Crown Court. The pair, from the Greenacres site in Little Billington, Leighton Buzzard, had been convicted last July of servitude, compulsory labour and assault charges after a trial at the court. They preyed on vulnerable, homeless people who had drink or drug dependencies. Tommy Connors Senior (left), 53, and his son Patrick Connors (right), 21, were jailed for keeping vulnerable people as 'slaves' They were sentenced today after a separate trial at the same court failed to reach verdicts on other charges against both men and two more of Connors Senior's sons James Connors, 25, and Tommy Junior Connors, 27. A jury at Luton Crown Court was discharged today after failing to reach verdicts on any of the charges against the four men, Bedfordshire Police said. The Crown Prosecution Service said it would not be pursuing a retrial. It comes after the daughter of Connors Senior and her husband were jailed over slavery charges last year. Josie Connors, 31 and James John Connors, 34, were sentenced to four years and 11 years respectively at Luton Crown Court following a 13-week trial last July. The couple, also from the Greenacres . site, were found guilty of holding a person in servitude and requiring a . person to perform forced or compulsory labour. Connors was also . convicted of a charge of assault. Speaking after today's sentencing, . Detective Inspector Sharn Basra from the Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire . and Hertfordshire Major Crime Unit, said: 'The victims in this case were . targeted by Tommy Senior and Patrick Connors, as well as James-John and . Josie Connors, as they were vulnerable, had dependencies on drink or . drugs, were homeless and basically had nowhere else to turn. The alleged crimes came to light in 2011 after police raided the Greenacres caravan site and the Connors were charged with offences related to servitude and forced labour . 'These were individuals who were not missed and became conditioned to the control of these Connors family members who exploited them to make huge sums of money. 'When we entered the Greenacres site in September 2011 we found victims who had been with members of the Connors family for more than 15 years and some who had been with them for only a few hours. 'The victims were afraid, living in squalid conditions, had no money or belongings, some suffered from malnutrition while others had old fracture wounds that hadn't healed properly and one man even had scurvy. 'In stark contrast, Tommy Senior, Patrick, James-John and Josie Connors were living in almost palatial residencies, had access to whatever they needed or wanted and were free to do as they pleased. 'Having spoken to the victims, we believe that more than 100 people could have passed through the site over the years and there is no telling how much money Tommy Senior, Patrick, James-John and Josie made from forcing people to work for them. 'I hope that the victims can now begin . moving on with their lives and that these sentences send a clear . message that behaviour of this nature is completely unacceptable and . that we will rigorously investigate and bring to justice anyone who . behaves in such a manner.' The . alleged crimes came to light in 2011 after police raided the Greenacres . caravan site on September 11 and the Connors were charged with offences . related to servitude and forced labour under the Coroners and Justice . Act 2009. The trial was told the complainants, who cannot be named for legal reasons, were forced to work in the Connors' block paving business . Connors Senior was convicted of one servitude charge and one forced labour charge, as well as one of ABH following the trial last year. Patrick Connors was convicted of conspiring to hold a person in servitude, as well as forced labour and ABH charges at the same trial. The trial was told the complainants, who cannot be named for legal reasons, were forced to work in the Connors' block paving business. The men were given next to no food, forced to wash in cold water and paid little or no money for working up to 19 hours a day, six days a week, it was said. Commenting after the sentencing today, Baljit Ubhey OBE, chief Crown prosecutor for Thames and Chiltern Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), said: 'Today's sentences conclude a lengthy and detailed investigation by the Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire Major Crime Unit (MCU). The CPS Thames and Chiltern's Complex Casework Unit (CCU) has worked closely with them since this investigation was launched. 'Tommy Senior, Patrick, James John and Josie Connors have been found guilty of offences involving the serious mistreatment of vulnerable people who had little option but to continue to work for them, because they were trapped by their personal circumstances. 'These four Connors used threats of violence and actual violence to prevent the victims leaving them or from alerting the authorities to their treatment. 'They forced them to work very long hours in their block paving business or doing their domestic chores when they were not working. They failed to pay them for their work and took advantage of their vulnerability and inability to protest in doing so. 'The offences were financially motivated, allowing these Connors family members to live in relative luxury while many of their victims were provided with the most basic and cramped living standards possible. 'The prosecution team have restrained in the region of £1 million from these members of the Connors family and identified a further £2 million of assets and the court will now consider questions of compensation and confiscation arising from these convictions.'","Forced the homeless to live in squalid conditions on Leighton Buzzard site .

Only last year Britain’s gardens, parks and woodlands were awash with a stunning riot of colour. But Mother Nature has been far less obliging this spring. Much of the country has failed to shake off the winter blues, as a bitter March followed hard on the heels of a cold winter. With spring delayed by over a month and no real signs of seasonal flowers such as tulips or bluebells, many will be wondering if Britain will ever burst into bloom. A burst of colour: Visitors at Kew's Royal Botanic Gardens saw the cherry trees in full bloom . Gloomy: This year the cherry walk is bare and barren as the harsh weather has forced the trees into 'survival mode' But garden writer Nigel Colborn, a former Royal Horticultural Society vice-chairman, says that with the arrival of warmer weather, we are likely to have a much shorter but more intense spring awakening. Forecasters are predicting temperatures will remain higher than the seasonal average for the rest of the week – a boon for gardeners. Mr Colburn said: ‘Plants, particularly spring varieties, have a self-survival kit. 'They won’t grow until the temperature is above 4C (39F) degrees for a period of time. Once warm weather sticks around they’ll kick into rapid growth. ‘Because of the bitterly cold March, we are running about a month late compared to a normal season. Then: Amy Gay picks tulips in the fields at Farrington Gurney, Somerset last year .

Thursday in the south east. But it is still too soon to pack away your winter woollens. At the weekend temperatures are due to plummet to a chilly 6C (43F). Slowly but surely: Oshia Pota, 28, soaks up the spring sunshine as she sits among the daffodils in London's Hyde Park today . Pretty: People punting on the River Cam in Cambridge today, with clear blue skies and warmer temperatures . Blue skies: It was a chilly start to the day across much of the UK, but the bright, crisp conditions were ideal for runners taking part in the London Marathon . Unsettled: Dog walkers in Essex enjoyed the spring sunshine at the beach - but wore coats to keep off the chill . Having fun: Dogs were pictured enjoying the spring sunshine on Chalkwell seafront in Essex today . May is almost upon us, but there were . still patches of frost in parts of the UK overnight between Saturday and Sunday, with a low of . -2.7C in Charlwood, Surrey. While there will be some sunny spells . across the UK in the coming week, Britons are advised to keep their . umbrellas and jackets close to hand along with their sunglasses. Mr Lawrence described bands of rain moving in from the Atlantic, bringing wind and showers to the UK. 'This week on the whole is on the unsettled side and quite changeable. 'We've got bands of rain moving in from the Atlantic, although it won't be a wash out.'

She told the tribunal: 'It was not a serious allegation - it was nothing more than a joke. Robert was sniffing a lot and I did apologise many times.' Mrs Davies had known her bosses, brothers Robert and Roger Mynett, for many years because she lived next door to their parents who set up their company which markets luxury Italian furniture in Britain. Roger Mynett told the tribunal: 'I felt she was obviously very uncomfortable and embarrassed about what had happened in the office.' But the panel heard Mrs Davies - who is married to a Welsh television presenter - had an 'exemplary discipline record'. No formal action was taken against her following the cocaine email and she was given a good reference when she left for a better-paid job in 2006. She rejoined the firm in 2008 but was later accused of discussing Mr Mynett's adoption plans with office manager Karen Jones. The tribunal  was told Mr Mynett allegedly shouted at her for discussing a 'private matter'. She told the hearing: 'I could see he was very angry. He referred to the cocaine issue. I was somewhat surprised, as that had taken place 10 years previously.' Office gossip: Robert Mynett reacted after Angela Davies was caught discussing his plans to adopt with a colleague . Mrs Davies claimed she thought the row was resolved but said she was dismissed when she turned up for work the next morning on June 29 last year. She added: 'I asked if I should be clearing my desk and he said: ""Yes"". But I did not want to leave.' Her husband Arfon Haines Davies, 65, who has appeared on ITV Wales for the last 30 years, told the tribunal: 'My wife was visibly upset. I asked her how things were at work and she got quite emotional and started crying. She told me she had been sacked. 'I know that my wife would not resign - it is not in her nature.' Robert Mynett told the hearing: 'I had been surprised and upset by her discussion of my private life. I told her that ""loose lips sink ships"".' But he claimed she 'fabricated' her version of events - in the same way as she made up the joke about cocaine taking. Reflex Marketing, based in Cardiff, denies her claim of unfair dismissal. It claims Mrs Davies resigned because it would have been 'unbearable' for her to return to the office after the row with Mr Mynett. The hearing in Cardiff was adjourned and a decision is expected next week.","Angela Davies sent jokey email suggesting her boss took cocaine in 2004 .

Accused: Roland Wright, 82, allegedly watched while another teacher molested a boy in his dorm room, a court hears . The former headmaster of Nick Clegg's old prep school stood watching while another teacher molested a young boy in his dorm, a court heard today. Roland Wright, now 82, subjected a dozen boys - some under the age of 14 - to a catalogue of abuse between 1959 and 1970, the jury was told. The offences are said to have happened at the exclusive £20,000-a-year Caldicott Preparatory School in Farnham Royal, Buckinghamshire, which was attended by the deputy prime minister, although he was not a pupil at the time of the abuse. Aylesbury Crown Court heard today how a former pupil woke one night to find he was being fondled by sports teacher Hugh Henry while 'suave' Wright looked on. Jurors have been told how Wright - also known by his middle name Peter - may have 'afforded' Mr Henry opportunities to 'indulge his interests' in young boys at Caldicott. At the time Wright was a sports and French teacher at the school but he became headmaster in 1968 and held the position until 1993. The witness, who was a full-time boarder at the school between 1960 to 1963 but cannot be named, said: 'I was in the dorm room where I and 12 other students slept. 'It happened very late about 11pm or 11.30pm. Lights out was between 8pm and 8:30pm. 'I was asleep with the other boys. The first thing I was aware of, I was being sexually assaulted by Hugh Henry. 'He wasn't alone in the room, Peter Wright was there too. Peter Wright was the other male teacher responsible for the sports activities with the school. 'He was very suave, very well dressed, very articulate and likeable. He had some considerable pride in the success he was able to bring through the school's sporting achievements through his coaching skills. 'He drove a sport car, I believe it was an E Type Jaguar. 'I can't be sure what he was doing that night, but I know he was in there because he was speaking to Hugh Henry. This occurred about two months after my commencement at the school. Abuse claims: Roland Wright, 82, is accused of abusing a dozen boys between 1959 and 1970. He denies wrong-doing . 'I formed the very strong impression that both men had been drinking - there was a very strong smell of whiskey from Hugh Henry, who was a smoker so there was a strong smell of cigarette smoke.' The witness told the court he turned in his bed, which forced Mr Henry to stop, and heard the other boys in the dorm waking up. He said he had been abused on numerous occasions by Mr Henry, who tutored him in his house on school grounds - but was never molested by Wright. But the witness did say there was a 'collusion' between the two teachers. John Price QC, prosecuting, read a statement from the witness's mother, who had contacted the school at the time raising concerns about Mr Henry's tuition taking place in his home. Former school: Wright was a master then a headmaster at Caldicott Preparatory School in Farnham Common, Buckinghamshire . Former school: Nick Clegg went to Caldicott Preparatory School in Farnham Royal, Buckinghamshire. He was not there at the time the incidents are alleged to have taken place . The mother said in her statement: 'I . asked my son how are the extra lessons. He said 'alright, but whenever I . get anything wrong, Mr Henry tackled me on to the bed. 'I was surprised and shocked. He informed me he was being tutored in Mr Henry's bedroom. 'I . contacted the school and relayed my concerns it was taking place in Mr . Henry's bedroom and wasn't happy with the rugby tackling and physical . contact. The master laughed at me and said ""Oh, you're not casting . aspersions on Mr Henry are you?"".' A short while after, Mr Henry was escorted from the school premises by police after being found in bed with a pupil. Wright, . of Farnham Royal, was a French and sports teacher, coached the first . rugby XV and later took the post of headteacher at the top school. The . court heard yesterday how Wright fondled young boys in his study . bedroom near to the dorms, and in a cottage close to the school where he . still resides. Wright denies 15 counts of indecent assault - including two counts of indecency with a child. The former headteacher, who uses a hearing aid to listen to proceedings, sat intently while the evidence was being given today. The trial, expected to last eight weeks, continues.

A son who had sex with his father's new girlfriend has been jailed after beating him up when he was confronted about the affair. Nigel Davies, 54, hit his son Thomas, 24, with a knuckle duster after discovering he had been sleeping with his partner Karen Keen, 36. The younger man overpowered Mr Davies Snr and grabbed him by the throat before repeatedly punching him on New Year's Eve in Newcastle-under-Lyme, Staffordshire. Jailed: Thomas Davies, 24, who slept with his father's girlfriend, was given 10 months behind bars when he appeared before Stoke Crown Court . The court heard the fight started when Nigel overheard mother-of-five Keen telling a friend she had also slept with Davies Jnr. The older man responded by grabbing the knuckle duster to attack his son and partner but it was wrestled away from him. Prosecutor David Bennett told the court Mr Davies attacked his son and knocked him back into the chair. But his son got up and Keen also became involved and started hitting him. Mr Bennett said: 'Mr Davies senior grappled with his son on the sofa. 'His son pinned him down and punched him with both hands. He was also struck by Keen. At one stage, Davies junior had his father round the throat.' Davies Jnr was jailed for 10 months at Stoke Crown Court after admitting assault occasioning actual bodily harm. Nigel Davies was left with cuts above his eyebrows, two black eyes, loosened teeth and bruising to his cheek. Thomas Davies told police he had been having an affair with Keen. He also admitted he had punched and headbutted his father because he had 'mouthed off' about him. Shortly after the incident Keen posted on her Facebook page: 'Well almost 5 hours in hospital to get another plaster on and bad break tom if you punch any one again i Will punch you haha xxx. 'Great new year locked up when done sweet fa apart stop people fighting which let them get on with it story got twisted now i am on bail f***** d**** so happy new year (sic).' Davies, of Newcastle-under-Lyme, pleaded guilty to the charge on the basis he initially acted in self-defence but the level of force became unreasonable. He was on bail at the time for another assault, for which he received a community order in February. Keen, of Longton, Staffordshire, also pleaded guilty to assault - which placed her in breach of a suspended prison sentence she received in 2011 for stabbing a former partner with a knife. Judge David Fletcher handed her a 12-month community order with supervision and 32 sessions at a centre which aims to help women get their lives back on track. He told them: 'This was a nasty assault, to some extent the victim started it. 'Nevertheless, I can think of very few more provocative reasons for him becoming a little bit angry.' Paul Cliff, representing both defendants, said all parties had consumed alcohol and Nigel Davies reacted angrily when his son admitted sleeping with Keen. He said: 'The defendant initially acted in self-defence, Miss Keen accepts at some point she struck the complainant.'","Thomas Davies, 24, had been sleeping with mother-of-five Karen Keen, 36 .

"PUBLISHED: . 11:15 EST, 29 January 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 08:43 EST, 20 February 2013 . These pictures show the incredible evolution of the food eaten by astronauts as they explored the cosmos over the past 50 years. NASA has released the images, which show the transition from the meat paste Yuri Gagarin, the first man in space, sucked from a toothpaste tube to the gourmet meals astronauts currently enjoy. The pictures were posted on the space agency's website by NASA's Space Food Systems Laboratory, where the agency researches, tests, and produces food fit for consumption outside of the Earth's atmosphere. Scroll down for video . Stellar cuisine: NASA have released photos chronicling the evolution of the food eaten in space. Pictured is a tray of food eaten on the Skylab, America's first space station, from 1973 - 1974 . Appetizing: Food from the Apollo missions from 1968-1972 was carefully vacuum-packed and balanced for nutrition but was not exactly gourmet . Reheating: These packages of thermostabilised foods such as cheddar cheese spread and even hot-dogs are heated to destroy pathogens, microorganisms and enzymes that may make it go off . For over 50 years, the methods involved in the preservation process have evolved.  Astronauts have gone from eating seed and crackers to home-cooked style dishes including shrimp, Spanish rice for a 'paella in space' dish and even ice cream. Nutrition in space is incredibly complicated. Everything from the packaging to the . menu has to be meticulously evaluated as the food must balance . nutrition, flavour, and safety with more practical concerns such as . preparation time, size, and shelf life. High tea: The Atlantis space shuttle's STS-110 crew eating on board the International Space Station . Eighties food: Shuttle 're-hydratables' used from 1981-1989. Food is sucked clear of all water and must be placed into hot water and 'rehydrated' before consumption . Colourful: Now food is freeze-dried and maintains its resemblance to the shrimp, paella and beef jerky but fruit and vegetables can also be taken and stored at room temperature . Weightlessness affects almost every system in the body, including those of the bones, muscles, heart and blood vessels, and nerves. The top priority is to ensure that the astronauts get the proper amount of nutrients, calories and minerals to maintain their physical health and performance for the life of the mission. Calorie requirements differ for astronauts. For instance, a small woman would require only about 1,900 calories a day, while a large man would require about 3,200 calories - about 800 more than on Earth. To complicate matters, spaceflight nutritional requirements are influenced by many of the physiological changes that occur during spaceflight. Also, the lack of gravity means smell - and taste - is impaired. Foods are either partially or completely . dehydrated to prevent them from spoiling. Meats are exposed to . radiation before they are put onboard the shuttle to give them a longer . shelf life. Meals are organized by the order in . which astronauts are going to eat them, and stored in locker trays held . by a net so they won't float away. They heat foods in a forced-air . convection oven that's kept between 160 and 170 degrees Fahrenheit. It . takes about 20 to 30 minutes to rehydrate and heat an average meal. Aside from keeping the astronauts' bellies full, food plays another vital role - keeping up morale. According to NASA, it 'not only provides nutrition for astronauts, but also enhances the psychological well-being of the crew by establishing a familiar element in an unfamiliar and hostile environment'. Studies have shown that eating certain foods - such as meatloaf and mashed potatoes or turkey on Thanksgiving - improve people's mood and give them satisfaction. Before food is approved, astronauts make up a panel that tastes the food and gives it a final OK on Earth before it blasts off. And research into the next generation of space food is currently underway, as humanity turns its gaze towards Mars. It might be the case that astronauts will grow their own food aboard the vessel as it hurtles towards the red plant. It is estimated that any manned mission to Mars will take three years, meaning thousands of meals must be provided. A statement from the Space Food Systems Laboratory said: 'The current crew member diet is completely supplied through prepackaged, shelf-stable food items produced on Earth. 'The duration of future missions may require a portion of the diet to be grown, processed, and prepared in the space habitat.' As other nations enter the space race, the variety of cuisine has widened considerably. On China's first manned space flight, Astronaut Yang Liwei ate yuxiang pork, kung pao chicken, and eight treasures rice, along with Chinese herbal tea. South Korea’s first astronaut, Yi So-yeon, was a crew member on the International Space Station and brought a special version of Korea's national dish, kimchi. It took three research institutes several years and millions of dollars to create a version of the fermented cabbage dish that was suitable for space travel. Basic: Foods eaten on the Mercury and Gemini missions from 1961-1966 including fruit cake and chicken sandwiches (centre) No ordinary lunch box: International Space Station food containers packed with sachets of dinner . Flavours: Now a wide selection of drinks is available to astronauts including tea with lemon, Hawaiian coffee, hot chocolate and a selection of fruit juices . The first man in space Yuri Gagarin ate pureed meat from toothpaste tubes as he orbited the Earth in 1961. When Americans followed the Russians into space they quickly developed freeze dried foods for the Project Mercury missions. However astronauts found the offerings unappetising and hard to rehydrate. By the time of the Gemini missions from 1965-6 the flavours had improved and the menu included shrimp cocktail, chicken and vegetables and butterscotch pudding. Astronauts now make up a panel that tastes the food and gives it a final OK on Earth before it blasts off.","Pictures show 50 years of the food that astronauts eat in space .

Bungling workmen painted yellow zig zag lines outside a former school without realising that it had closed and been demolished four years ago. The contractors seemingly didn't notice that they were painting 'school' on the road next to an empty field in Chester. The council closed Woodfield Primary in 2008 because there were too few children, and it was demolished a year later. Blunder: Workman painted yellow zig-zag lines on the road outside this empty field four years after the school was demolished in Chester . Roadworkers were instructed to paint the lines by the local authority and they diligently did the job without realising anything was wrong.

For anyone who has ever wondered what is was like to be a musician, a new website has the answer. Musician Beck worked with director Chris Milk to create a groundbreaking new interactive site to let viewers see and hear a gig from his point of view. The Hello, Again site lets you move your point of view so it feels as if you are standing anywhere in the room - whether it's among the crowd, next to the band or even up on stage with Beck. And thanks to a bank of specially designed microphones that were dotted around the venue, you hear the music in 3D surround sound, so it comes at you from the direction of the performers. Click here to watch the song (may take some time to load) and scroll down to see how it was made . By using their more or even a webcam to move the point of view, viewers can see and hearwhat it really feels like to be on stage at a Beck gig . Organisers created a special 260 stage for the song, with Beck in the middle while 160 musicians are around the perimeter of the Los Angeles studio . The special gig was funded by car maker Lincoln as part of an advertising campaign. 'Musicians have been covering, remaking, and remixing classic songs for as long as we’ve been listening,' it said. 'Yet what Beck is doing with David Bowie’s 1977 classic, Sound And Vision, is something well beyond a cover,' the organisers claim. Over 160 musicians took part in the recording, including an orchestra, a drum line, a row of electric guitarists, a musical saw, modular synthesizers, a Theremin player, a yodeler, 2 different choirs, a harpist, a range of percussionists from around the world, and the Dap-Kings. Led by conductor David Campbell (Beck's father), they backed the singer, who was at the centre of the room on a small circular stage. Three panoramic cameras were mounted around the venue, along with specially built 'heads' to capture sound in 3D. 'From the way we arranged the song down to the live performance, we were focused on the idea of immersing the live and online audiences' audio senses by having the music come at them from every direction,' said Beck. 'It's difficult to re-create a live concert, but by using this 360-degree approach, it opens up an entirely new kind of experience that will surprise people.' The site also allows the viewer to see the choir and orchestra, and pan around complete with 360 sound to hear exactly what they would . Viewers can also take a wider view to see the gig from an audience member's point of view . Working alongside concert production designer Willo Perron, Director Chris Milk transformed Stage 14 at Fox Studios in Los Angeles into a circular, rotating music hall in which the stage surrounds the audience. As more than 160 different musicians fill the circular stage, they’ll literally rotate around the crowd, creating an immersive sound experience unlike any other. There are three locations for 360 video and audio, and on the website you can select them and hear exactly what you'd hear if you were there . This bizarre recording device – sculpted into . the shape of a human head and surrounded by lifelike ears – captures . sound in a 360-degree immersive style, the way a person would actually . hear it if they were sitting in the performance space with the . musicians.

Commons Deputy Speaker Nigel Evans should not step down over allegations of rape and sexual assault, former chief whip Andrew Mitchell has said. Mr Mitchell, who quit the cabinet last year amid claims he called police officers 'plebs' - said it would set a 'terrible' precedent. Tory MP Mr Evans was arrested at his home and questioned by police on Saturday but insists the claims by two young men are 'completely false'. 'Completely false': Nigel Evans today having lunch at his local pun in Pendleton where he received cards from well-wishers including a Margaret Thatcher card which read 'The lady's not for turning' He made clear through his solicitor that he intended to carry on as Deputy Speaker while police continue their investigation. But Speaker John Bercow has agreed he . be excused from duties chairing the week-long debate on the Queen's . Speech, which begins on Wednesday. Defence Secretary Philip Hammond . questioned yesterday whether Mr Evans could continue as Deputy Speaker . while he was under investigation. 'I stick rigidly to the view that we . should treat people as innocent until they are proven guilty but it is . quite difficult to carry out a sensitive and high profile role while . being under this kind of scrutiny,' he told the BBC. But Mr Mitchell told BBC Radio 4's . Today: 'If he were to resign now we would be in a terrible position . where every public office holder would be open to blackmail and false . stories in the media, triggering their resignation.' Stepped down: Andrew Mitchell quit the cabinet last year amid claims he called police officers 'plebs' 'Anyone who is caught up in the sort . of intensive media storm which Nigel has faced, and which I and my . family faced, obviously is in a very difficult position to carry out . their job. 'But in this particular circumstance I . am in no doubt that Nigel Evans should not resign and that he will be . able to fulfil his duties as required by the Speaker. 'We have three deputy speakers in the House of Commons so if necessary there can be a degree of burden sharing. 'He has not been charged, he has not . been found guilty, and we do still live in a country where you are . supposed to be innocent until proven guilty.' Deputy Speaker Nigel Evans was spoken to about 'inappropriate sexual behaviour' four years ago, according to reports . Close up: Mr Evans appeared to have covered up a scar on his forehead with make-up when he addressed the press outside his home today . He said he did not believe there was . any truth in the allegations against a friend and colleague of 20 years . whom he had known 'in good times and in bad times'. Mr Mitchell admits swearing at . officers who stopped him cycling out of the main Downing Street gates . last September but denies using the highly-charged insult. Asked why he resigned despite denying . the claims, Mr Mitchell said: 'In my circumstances, this matter had . dragged on for 28 days. 'I took the view that I could no . longer discharge the duties the Prime Minister had asked me to discharge . and that's why I resigned.' Nigel Evans, left, and Lembit Opik stroll through Soho on Thursday night. Mr Evans is currently on bail . Mr Evans, the 55-year-old MP for . Ribble Valley, described his arrest and questioning by police as 'the . worst 24 hours of my life'. He had what appeared to be a . gash on his forehead which aides asked a television make-up artist to . try to conceal before he made his statement yesterday. The injury was not evident . in pictures taken of him on Thursday night when he was out in Soho with . former Lib Dem MP Lembit Opik. 'I was interviewed by the police . concerning two complaints, one of which dates back four years, made by . two people who are well known to each other and until Saturday, I . regarded as friends,' he said. 'The complaints are completely false . and I cannot understand why they have been made, especially as I have . continued to socialise with one as recently as last week. 'I appreciate the way the police have . handled this in such a sensitive manner and I would like to thank my . colleagues, friends and members of the public who have expressed their . support and, like me, a sense of incredulity at these events.' It has since been reported that Mr Evans . was interviewed by senior Conservatives in 2009 over an allegation of . 'inappropriate sexual behaviour'. Transport . Secretary Patrick McLoughlin, who was then opposition chief whip, is . believed to have interviewed Evans after an accusation that he made an unwanted advance on a man he had been drinking with. The Daily Telegraph, citing a friend of . Mr Evans, reported that the MP explained the matter was a . 'misunderstanding'. The friend said there was no 'verbal warning' but . added that Mr Evans may have been given some 'friendly advice'. The . matter was not reported to police and it is understood the man who . accused Mr Evans of inappropriate conduct continued to associate with . him. Downing Street refused to comment on whether David Cameron knew of the allegations at the time. News . of Saturday’s arrest at the constituency home of the popular MP for the . Ribble Valley in Lancashire came as a huge shock to colleagues at . Westminster, many of whom spoke out in his support.

He has owned the £250,000 two-bedroom terrace cottage – . which has a small House of Commons portcullis on its wooden nameplate – . for 15 years. Officers have been searching his London and Lancashire homes as well as his car, a white . Saab convertible parked in the village. He was released on bail on . Saturday night, shortly afterwards saying on Facebook: ‘Thanks for the . amazing overwhelming support at this difficult time.’ Mr Evans – said to be ‘very shaken up’ by his arrest – refused to answer questions except answering ‘ok’ when asked how he felt. In . 2009 the Daily Mail told how the MP had spoken of ‘shocking’ failures . at Singleton Hospital in Swansea following the death of his 86-year-old . mother from the superbug C.diff. In addition to online support, Mr Evans was backed by family, neighbours and political colleagues. His 49-year-old sister, Louise Collins, who took over their father’s newsagent’s business in Swansea after his death, said: ‘The family love him to death and we’re 100 per cent behind him.’ His local Conservative Association released a statement saying: ‘In our democracy everyone accused is innocent until proven guilty and therefore unless Nigel chooses himself to cease to be our MP or the electorate vote him out or justice system intervenes, we expect him to continue as normal to fulfil his duties in representing the people of the Ribble Valley.’ Arrested: Nigel Evans is pictured with David Cameron, who has been informed about the claims . Quizzed: Mr Evans is pictured posing with two dancers . Brian Binley, Tory MP for Northampton South and a friend of Mr Evans, said he had been ‘deeply disturbed and shocked’ at his arrest. ‘I know him to be caring, compassionate, and in no way would he inflict himself violently on any other person,’ he said. Leicestershire Tory MP Andrew Bridgen, who was accused of a sex assault two years ago only for police to drop their inquiries six days later, also said Mr Evans should continue. Earlier, however, Mr Hammond told BBC1’s Andrew Marr Show that while he stuck ‘rigidly’ to the principle of innocent until proven guilty, ‘it is quite difficult to carry out a sensitive and high-profile role while being under this kind of scrutiny’. Tory sources stressed that, as Deputy Speaker, Mr Evans does not technically take the Conservative whip, so the question of it being withdrawn does not arise. The high-profile arrest will fuel the debate over whether anonymity should be granted to those suspected but not charged over sex offences. Former Metropolitan Police Commissioner Lord Blair told Sky News that while it was ‘a real problem, I think the names have to be given’. Making a stand: Mr Evans, left, is pictured with Speaker John Bercow, right, at last year's Gay Pride march . Lancashire Police said Mr Evans, who has represented the constituency since 1992, had been arrested on suspicion of raping one man and sexually assaulting another between July 2009 and March 2013. Following several hours of questioning by detectives at Preston Police Station, he was released on bail to June 19. Mr Evans was one of three deputy speakers elected in a secret ballot of MPs in 2010. Later that year he came out as gay, saying he was 'tired of living a lie'. He told The Mail on Sunday that he had also been threatened with exposure by political opponents.

The Fast Diet became a bestselling book earlier this year as those keen to drop a dress size rushed to follow the advice of fasting for two days a week. The diet from Dr Michael Mosley recommends women only eat 500 calories and men 600 on their two fasting days. But isn't that a little bit too boring and restrictive? Not at all, says nutritionist Dr Sarah Schenker who has written a companion book to The Fast Diet with Mimi Spencer. The Fast Diet Recipe Book contains 180 low-calorie recipes which they say will fill you up and stave off hunger. Feast on 300 calories: Dr Sarah Schenker said you can be full up if you eat the right foods (posed by model) You might expect the recipes to be all salads and no carbs but there's also warming comfort food such as a cottage pie and a beef stew. Dr Schenker, 40, told the MailOnline the meals also allow for 'sociable eating' - her cottage pie serves four and is packed with tasty ingredients so dinner guests won't know it's low calorie. 'You are often excluded from sociable eating when dieting but some of the meals are designed to be shared and you would often never know the meals are low calorie because they are satisfying and filling,' she explained. Many of the recipes are heavy in proteins - such as eggs, chicken and fish - and use ingredients with a low glycemic index such as nuts, grains and vegetables. Food for fasting: Dr Schenker, left, and Mimi Spencer have complied 180 low calories dishes for The Fast Diet Recipe Book, right . The mother-of-two,  from Wanstead, East London, added that it's easy to create a satisfying meal with just 300 calories if you use the right ingredients. Her 243 calorie cottage pie is packed with vegetables including carrots and tomatoes and swaps fatty beef for extra-lean minced beef. Meanwhile she creates a baby aubergine salad full of flavour by adding spices and seeds. She added that the recipes don't always do away with carbs because it is important to consume them if you are leading an active lifestyle. 'We don't want people fainting through lack of food on their fasting days,' she said. 'The point is to fill up on foods that will keep you fuller for longer. 'Some dieters avoid rice because of the carbs but with the right type and quantity it's fine. Basmati rice contains slow release carbs so will keep you going for longer so I include that in some of the recipes. It's hard for people to go without carbs, it's better to strike a balance of having them in moderation as often the problem is people eat them too much.' Support: Mimi Spencer and Dr Michael Mosley, pictured, wrote the original Fast Diet and Dr Schenker's book is a companion text for dieters . Dr Schenker,believes the Fast Diet is effective because it's easy to follow and many of the recipes are quick to make ahead of a busy day. It doesn't force dieters to continually restrict what they are eating but to just set aside two days a week to diet. She said many followers tend to pick Monday and Thursday as their fast days but it really depends on individual lifestyles. She said: 'It's good to prepare in advance which days to make your fast days. Some people do it at the weekend if they don't have much on. Others prefer Monday as it's the start of the working week and then Thursday so they can look forward to eating what they like at the weekend. 'I wouldn't advise making a fast day one where you have a lot on at work!' she said. On fast days, she recommends having a filling low GI breakfast - such as smoke salmon, porridge with fruit or an omelette with vegetables. Then skipping lunch and fasting until dinner when you should have another filling meal. Go hungry without being starving: Dr Schenker recommends skipping lunch on fasting days and having a filling breakfast and evening meal . She said the there are additional health benefits to the fasting than just weight loss. It can also improve your hormonal balance and insulin production - meaning developing a condition like diabetes associated with obesity is less likely. However, she added that while the 5:2 diet means you can in theory eat what you like on the non fasting days, you need to do this 'within reason' if you do want to gain the health benefits of fasting. 'The point is your body becomes calorie deficient on the fasting days. You don't want to then overindulge on calories on the non fasting days or your weekly calorie intake will remain the same.' Dr Schenker is an expert on healthy eating after gaining a degree in nutrition and dietetics from the University of Surrey. She's previously put her knowledge into practise by advising top sports stars on their diets including premiership footballers, jockeys and boxers.

Good Samaritan: But this photograph of Leslie Austin was put on a police poster accusing him of being a suspect in the London riots . A Good Samaritan who went out of his way to help the vulnerable during the London riots has won a pay-out from police after officers published posters accusing him of being involved with the violence. Leslie Austin, who volunteers for numerous charities in Hackney, was thanked by multiple officers for protecting bystanders on the night of August 8 2011. But a few months later he was shocked to see his face plastered all over adverts which described him as a possible suspect. The Metropolitan Police has now agreed to pay the 49-year-old substantial damages after a judge at the High Court in London ruled that it had libelled him by continuing to distribute the posters even after he complained. Mr Austin was 'widely respected' in Hackney, according to his lawyer Matthew Nicklin QC, and on the night that rioting broke out in the area he took to the streets to make sure that no one was in danger. He escorted a distressed elderly woman away from the unrest, removed debris near a bus so the driver could continue his journey and helped people who were trapped in a building near a burning car. However, in May 2012 he noticed his photograph on a poster headed 'Operation Withern Identity Sought' which police had distributed to be displayed in local shops. The advert asked for help from the public in identifying those pictured, including Mr Austin, who were described as having been 'involved in the disorder'. 'This was extremely distressing to the claimant,' Mr Nicklin said. 'Not only was it false in his case, but he felt his safety to be at risk as there had been revenge attacks following the riots.' Mr Austin contacted his local police station to point out the error, and officers told him that the posters would soon by replaced and his picture removed. However, his photograph remained on the Hackney Police website until June 15, and a picture of him provided by police was published by the Hackney Gazette on June 7. Moreover, the posters with his face on remained on display in the borough for a further two months. Violence: Mr Austin (not pictured) helped police by protecting vulnerable residents of Hackney . Mr Austin repeatedly had to explain to neighbours, shopkeepers and even his employer that he had not in fact been involved with the violence. The Metropolitan Police initially denied the plaintiff's case, but later admitted that Mr Austin had been seriously libelled by the continuation of the poster campaign. Officials have apologised and agreed to pay Mr Austin's legal costs as well as damages. David Hirst, for the police, defended the campaign, saying it helped to bring thousands of rioters to justice. He also pointed out that after Mr Austin initially came forward, officers told the Hackney Gazette of their mistake and informed the newspaper that he was in fact a public-spirited 'Good Samaritan'. 'The Metropolitan Police are sorry that the steps taken to remove and replace the posters from local shops proved inadequate to correct the position, that Mr Austin's image was not promptly removed from the police website and that they failed to ensure that Mr Austin's image was not published in the Hackney Gazette,' Mr Hirst said. 'It is accepted that these failures have caused damage to the claimant's reputation and have caused him much distress and great concern.'","Leslie Austin, 49, protected vulnerable bystanders in Hackney during riots .

Gardeners' World will not be broadcast in its regular slot at 8.30 on BBC Two tonight because of the semi-finals of the World Snooker Championship. And lovers of the show, which recently pulled in 2.6million viewers, have taken to the internet to complain about their interests being repeatedly sidelined in favour of sport. As well as taking a break for the snooker every May, Gardeners' World is usually displaced by wall-to-wall coverage of Wimbledon in June and July. Criticism: Monty Don has slammed the BBC for replacing Gardeners' World with snooker coverage . Mr Don, 57, complained on Twitter that the cancellation of his programe was a 'crazy hiatus' which was 'bound to annoy' his audience - adding, 'and me'. He continued: 'Total lack of interest in programme or audience by schedulers.' The Bank Holiday weekend is usually one of the busiest times for gardeners, and millions were hoping to tune in for Mr Don's tips on how to take advantage of the warming weather. Viewer Bryan Appleyard tweeted: 'They should be made aware that the whole point of a show like GW is continuity.' The presenter replied: 'Exactly... but few if anyone in BBC management understands that. Can't see football being randomly dropped.' Letdown? The BBC has been accused of not doing enough for gardening fans as warm weather arrives . Other fans have called from the programme to be expanded beyond its half-hour timeslot, with Roz Smith tweeting: 'Why isn't GW longer? At least an hour. Why does snooker... any sport ALWAYS take precedence over GW?' Mr Don tweeted: 'Because they are cheap.' Ms Smith said she wanted the BBC to broadcast more gardening coverage, but Mr Don said: 'I am afraid the chances of this are low. GW is currently seen as more or less fulfilling the gardening remit.' Former Gardeners' World presenter urged fans to take action, saying: 'Write a letter to the Beeb saying what you want to see - tweets are too easily ignored. Good luck!' Writer Matthew Appleby, from magazine Horticulture Week, accused the BBC of letting down the nation's gardeners. Replacement: Mr Don's show takes an annual break for the World Snooker Championships . 'The bad weather this year has meant it has been a tough season for Britain's 20million garden owners,' he said. 'And now, just as spring has finally sprung and Gardeners' World gets its best audience in years, the BBC is dropping the show for snooker again. 'The BBC's sole gardening show, which only lasts half an hour, should be given priority at the peak of the gardening season. 'They are short-changing licence fee payers who like gardening.' In the past, BBC garden makeover shows like Ground Force, starring Alan Titchmarsh and Charlie Dimmock, have attracted up to 12million viewers. A BBC spokesman said: 'Gardeners' World is broadcast across the year, breaking only for major events. 'The transmission of sporting events is dependent on their dates, so it is therefore necessary to move all types of programming, not just of the gardening type, around in the schedule and this is done with minimum disruption.'","Gardeners' World will not be broadcast tonight because of snooker .

Free: Paedophile Gary Karn 48, sexually assaulted two girls aged seven and eight on an allotment but has been spared jail . A paedophile who avoided jail because was worried his family would be affected if he went to prison is having his sentence reviewed. Gary Karn escaped with just a suspended sentence after being convicted of sexually abusing two little girls as they picked fruit at his allotment. But following public outrage at the case, the Attorney General is now considering whether to launch an appeal against the sentence. The 48-year-old father of three inappropriately touched his victims, aged seven and eight, after inviting them into his greenhouse to help themselves  to raspberries. He was found guilty of three counts of sexual assault against a child at Norwich Crown Court earlier this week. Judge Mark Lucraft imposed an 18-month suspended sentence, saying a jail term would unfairly affect his family as he would probably lose his job in a food processing factory. ‘I have to consider the impact on them - people who are not in any way at fault yet might suffer serious hardship from your actions,’ he said. But the father of one of his victims said: ‘He talks about the effect on the offender’s family, but what about the effects on my family?' It was revealed today that a member of public has asked the Attorney General's Office to review whether the sentence might have been 'unduly lenient'. The office is considering the case, and must decide whether to refer the sentencing to the Court of Appeal by May 22. Trial: After considering the mitigation in the case, Judge Mark Lucraft (left) agreed Gary Karn (right) should not go to prison . The court heard Karn invited the . girls on to his allotment. He told them that he needed to brush spiders . off them then put his hands up the top of one girl, and down the . trousers of the other. He . was also charged with six counts of possession of extreme pornography . and one count of possession of indecent photographs of a child. Mr Lucraft decided not to proceed with these offences but took them into consideration. Jude Durr, defending, had told the judge: ‘Imprisonment will almost certainly lead to him losing his job. 'If he loses his liberty and they lose . their house, that would have pretty devastating consequences on the . family circumstances.’ The decision outraged the victims’ families, who said the girls have been left traumatised from both the . incident and the ordeal of having to give evidence in court. Assaults: Karn had attacked the two girls at these Norwich allotments, claiming the victims had spiders on them . The father of the eight-year-old added: ‘I find it all very disgusting. The judge has been too lenient.’ He told how the two girls were . playing on his allotment last September when Karn invited them to pick . vegetables and fruit on his plot. The next morning the mother of one . the girls overheard the pair saying they ‘didn’t want to talk to the man . down the allotment’ again. The girls then told what had happened . after breaking down in tears when preparing a salad using vegetables . from Karn’s allotment. The father continued: ‘I feel totally let down. The judge lives in cloud cuckoo land. ‘It has caused arguments between me and my wife – it happened on my watch. It has caused a lot of anguish and grief.’ Harrowing: The two child victims gave evidence at Norwich Crown Court (pictured) during a three-day trial . He added: ‘I told my daughter that . she wouldn’t have to see that man ever again and it is all over and done . with and now he is going to be walking around – how do you explain that . to an eight-year-old? It will just confuse her. ‘We have put her through this –and ourselves – and for what? If I had known the outcome I would not have bothered.’ Talking about how it has affected his . daughter, the father said: ‘There are noticeable little differences. She won’t stay upstairs in bed any more if her mum gets up and she . carries her teddy everywhere as a comfort toy. ‘What scares me is that I am one of . those parents who encourages my children to talk to people and . acknowledge them when they are spoken to. The allotment is the last . place I would have expected this to happen.’ Mr Lucraft suspended Karn’s sentence for two years and banned him from working with children for five years. He was also ordered to carry out 200 hours of unpaid work and was given a five-year sexual offences prevention order.","Factory worker Gary Karn sexually assaulted two girls while picking fruit .

Many commuters may be fed up with over-crowding on the railways, but there are some stations which serve a just handful of passengers each year. New figures have revealed a number of 'ghost' stations which receive fewer than 100 travellers a year - with the least-used facility serving just 14 last year. These practically redundant stations are apparently kept open by the rail companies solely so they can avoid the bureaucracy it would take to officially close them. Deserted: Teesside Airport railway station is Britain's least-used with just 14 passengers last year . Overkill: Dorking West, which served 16 passengers, is one of three stations in the town of 17,000 . Data released yesterday by the Office of Rail Regulation rank every station in the country by how many passengers pass through each year. The least-used station of all was Teesside Airport, near Darlington, which was visited by just 14 passengers in the 2011-12 financial year. The station's unpopularity is due to the fact that it receives just one train per week, and is linked to an airport with just two regular scheduled flights. Second is Dorking West in Surrey, where 16 passengers got on or off a train last year. Although trains stop at the station every two hours, it is crippled by being one of three stations in a town of just 17,000 inhabitants. Campaign: Activists argue that Denton in Greater Manchester, where 30 passengers got on or off a train last year, deserves a more frequent service . Underused: Reddish South is on the same line as Denton, receiving just one train a week with no return service, and welcomed 56 passengers last year . 1. Teesside Airport, Co Durham - 14 passengers . 2. Dorking West, Surrey - 16 passengers . 3. Denton, Greater Manchester - 30 passengers . 4. Reddish South, Greater Manchester - 56 passengers . 5. Coombe, Cornwall - 60 passengers . 6. Elton & Orston, Nottinghamshire - 72 passengers . 7. Barry Links, Angus - 86 passengers . 8. Breich, West Lothian - 90 passengers . 9. Buckenham, Norfolk - 100 passengers . 10. Sugar Loaf, Powys - 120 passengers . Denton, in Greater Manchester, is at the centre of a campaign aiming to increase its number of passengers from the 30 it received in 2011-12. Activists argue that the only reason the station cannot attract more people is that it receives just one train a week, heading to Stalybridge, while there is no service which goes in the opposite direction. Alan Jones, chairman of the Friends of Denton Station, suggested that the figures were misleading and blamed railway officials for the station's neglect. 'I'm sure that if there were more trains people would use them,' he told the Independent. 'This is a valued service and we are trying to get a regular service.' But Northern Rail said the only reason it kept the station open was to fulfil the terms of its franchise agreement. A total of eight stations had passenger numbers in double figures, including Reddish South, Coombe and Barry Links. By way of comparison, the busiest station in 2011-12 was London Waterloo, where 94,045,510 passed through. All of the top seven busiest were in London, with Victoria and Liverpool Street taking second and third place. The highest-placed stations outside the capital were Birmingham New Street, Glasgow Central and Leeds. Scandal: Stations like Coombe, which served 60 people last year, are kept open for bureaucratic reasons . Contrast: The busiest station in Britain last year was London Waterloo, with nearly 100million passengers . The neglect of so many of Britain's smaller stations underlines how many areas are under-served by the railway network despite having their own facilities for trains. It is easier for train operating countries to run 'zombie' services on lines they no longer wish to serve properly, as closing stations requires a lengthy consultation process. The 50th anniversary of the Beeching cuts which closed more than 2,000 stations fell earlier this year. The controversial move meant many smaller towns were left with a station, and many services were re-routed to pass through London and other population hubs. But the latest figures on unused stations show that even some communities which were spared the axe do not have an effectively functioning railway.","Teesside Airport station received just 14 passengers in 2011-12 .

A couple were so drunk they could barely stand as they looked after an 18-month-old child after downing a bottle of whisky, a court heard today. Karl Hayden and Deborah Hambrook were wheeling the little boy in a pushchair and at one point walked into the road with him without looking where they were going. After Hambrook, 36, vomited onto the pavement, toppling the buggy, shoppers called police because they were worried about the child's welfare. But the couple lashed out violently at officers, who found an empty whisky bottle in the pushchair. A judge at Southampton Magistrates' Court today condemned their behaviour, saying they had exposed the child to 'physical risk' and 'emotional harm'. Bystanders were alarmed at Hayden and Hambrook's behaviour as they shopped near the Lidl supermarket in Eastleigh, Hampshire on April 3. One witness saw Hayden, 38, pushing the buggy into the road 'without awareness of the cars', according to prosecutor Bernadette Kearney. As soon as PC Catherine Manns arrived at the scene, she received a call from PCSO Rhys McCarthy, who said the child was in danger and he needed help 'as soon as possible'. He had seen Hambrook throw up and stagger away, which caused the pushchair to fall over, while both defendants were slurring their words and 'talking gibberish'. But when Ms Manns went to intervene the couple lashed out, swearing and manhandling the two officers. 'Hambrook and Hayden told the officers the child's name but became instantly hostile,' Ms Kearney told the court. 'They were very vocal and using raised voices. PC Manns could tell they were both drunk. Both parties were unstable on their feed and smelt of alcohol. 'Hambrook's pupils were very small and Hayden seemed very vacant, as if there was a time delay. 'The child's hands were bright red, he was very cold to touch and had bright red cheeks. He was very quiet and was not crying at the time.' Hambrook repeatedly tried to leave the scene, and when she disobeyed orders to stay the police tried to handcuff her. She assaulted Ms Manns, grabbing her throat 'quite tightly' and pulling out a clump of her hair. At the same time, Hayden pushed Mr McCarthy in the chest. Criticised: A judge said the couple had exposed the child to 'physical risk' and 'emotional harm' The unemployed couple, from nearby Chandler's Ford, were eventually arrested and taken into custody. The child was found to be soaked in urine, and did not have a blanket to keep him warm even though it was 6.30 in the evening. Photos of clumps of Ms Manns's hair, which fell out that evening, her bleeding knuckles and marks on her back and torso were shown to the judge. Hambrook pleaded guilty to being drunk in charge of a child in a public place and three counts of assaulting police officers, and was given a 12-week suspended sentence. Hayden received a 12-month community order after admitting being drunk in charge of a child in a public place and assaulting a police officer. District Judge Lorraine Morgan said: 'The extremely aggravating factor in this case is the level of your intoxication whilst you were in charge of a small child, and the potential consequences to him. 'You put him at physical risk because of your physical incapacity while in charge of him and you also exposed him to emotional harm. 'He has seen people who are drunk and people who fight and become involved in street brawls, which may have an impact on him.' Stephen Tricker, mitigating, said the couple felt remorse for their actions, and had pledged never to drink again. The pair must also pay £100 each to Ms Manns, £50 compensation to Mr McCarthy and £50 pounds to a custody officer who was assaulted by Hambrook.","Karl Hayden pushed 18-month-old's pushchair into road without looking .

The extraordinary antique has survived upheavals including the wars of Alexander the Great, the arrival of Islam and a string of colonial conflicts. Amazingly, it has remained intact and apparently in near-mint condition ever since it was made in the 4th or 5th century BC. Sold: This ancient Persian bowl went up for auction in London this week and fetched nearly £500,000 . The 8in-wide green bowl had been a treasured keepsake for a British family which acquired it in the 1950s. When they decided to sell the beautiful object, auctioneers Bonhams expected it to fetch between £30,000 and £50,000. But at the auction of antiquities in London yesterday, the bowl was sold to an unnamed buyer for £481,250. Made using the lost-wax casting method, the shallow bowl features a flared rim decorated with twelve projecting tear-shaped lobes interspersed with twelve elongated petals. Rare: The green glass vessel would have been a high-status object when it was made 2,500 years ago . The Achaemenid Empire was founded in the 6th century BC by Cyrus the . Great, who to this day is venerated as one of the greatest figures in . Persian history. Its rulers presided over the largest empire in the history of the world . at the time, stretching from Egypt and Greece as far as modern-day . India. Emperors such as Xerxes and Darius fought a series of wars with the . Greeks, immortalised in the works of Herodotus, known as the 'Father of . History'. One of the best-known moments in Achaemenid history is the Battle of . Thermopylae in 480 BC, when 300 Spartans almost managed to defeat up to . 150,000 Persians, as depicted in the film 300. The dynasty came to an end in 334 BC, when Alexander the Great invaded from Macedonia and imposed Greek rule over Persia. 'This bowl really is one of a kind,' said Bonhams' head of antiquities Madeleine Perridge. 'Bowls like this were made by expert craftsmen and were not mass produced. 'They are incredibly rare and hardly ever come on the market. The fact that this one is still intact after 2,500 years is amazing. 'We knew it was a special item and our pre-sale estimate was conservative, but we weren't expecting it to do quite as well as it did. 'There was a real buzz in the auction room with bids coming in from all angles. 'We had the real pleasure of breaking the good news to the vendor at the end of the auction.' The bowl dates back to the time of the Achaemenid Empire, the first dynasty to rule over all of modern-day Iran. It was made shortly before Macedonian king Alexander the Great invaded in 334 BC. The exact history of the bowl before it came to the UK is unknown, but it would have been a highly prized object owned by a wealthy Persian family.","Vessel dates back to Achaemenid Empire in 4th or 5th century BC .

David Cameron often only learns about government decisions when they are reported by the media, his former policy guru has revealed. Painting a shambolic picture of the Downing Street operation, Steve Hilton said the inability of No 10 to control government decisions was ‘pretty horrific’. ‘Very often you’ll wake up in the morning and hear on the radio or the news or see something in the newspapers about something the Government is doing,’ he said. David Cameron's former strategy guru Steve Hilton (left) has revealed that the Prime Minister often finds out about his own government's policies through the radio and in newspapers . ‘And you think, well, hang on a second – it’s not just that we didn’t know it was happening, but we don’t even agree with it! The Government can be doing things... and we don’t agree with it? How can that be?’ Mr Hilton revealed that ministers spend only 30 per cent of their time dealing with the Government’s priorities, with 40 per cent spent handling diktats from the European Union and the rest on ‘random things... which were not anything to do with the coalition agreement’. He described how No 10 is frequently left out of the loop as important policy changes are pushed through by ‘paper-shuffling’ civil servants who made life ‘impossible’ for ministers by drowning them in paperwork. ‘The bureaucracy masters the politicians,’ he said. Mr Hilton, who is credited with masterminding Mr Cameron’s ‘detoxification’ of the Conservative Party in opposition, is regarded as his closest friend in politics and spent years as his policy adviser. Steve Hilton, who was the Prime Minister's 'blue skies thinker' and remains one of his closest friends, said Cameron often opposes the measures his own ministers put forward . Born in 1969, a child of Hungarian immigrants, Hilton was a scholarship boy at Christ’s Hospital and studied PPE at Oxford. He met Cameron when he was seconded from Saatchi & Saatchi to work on John Major’s 1992 election - when he came up with the 'New Labour, New Danger' advertisement. Hilton set up a marketing consultancy, Good Business which worked with Nike, McDonald’s and Coca-Cola. He was widely credited with  his rebranding the 'nasty party' and turning Old Etonian Cameron into 'Dave'. Hilton's role was seen as marketing the prime minister for the more liberal audience who had switched to Blair in 1997. It is believed Stewart Pearson in the biting TV satire The Thick Of It is based on Hilton. He would often walk around Number 10 without shoes on, and hosted meetings in stockinged feet. His controversial and radical views, including scrapping maternity leave, abolishing JobCentres, suspending consumer rights laws for nine months 'to see what would happen' and ignoring some EU employment regulations, drew strong criticism from all parties. In March last year he announced he was taking a 12-month ‘sabbatical’ teaching at Stanford University in California. Friends said he had become disillusioned with the difficulty of driving through reforms. He became so frustrated by the civil service that he tried to persuade Mr Cameron to slash the number of Whitehall officials by two-thirds – only to be blocked by the Cabinet Secretary. His reported comments came during a lecture to students in California. Mr Hilton complained that the paperwork associated with everyday decisions was impossible for ministers and special advisers to wade through, so many policy changes were simply nodded through. ‘They can be quite trivial things but they can be quite serious as well, and they can certainly affect the real world,’ he said. ‘That’s how you end up with stuff happening that the Government is doing that the people running the Government don’t know about, or disagree with. When you start thinking about how things get decided, it’s pretty incredible... it’s a brilliant system for paper-shuffling people to be in control.’ Asked about the comments, a Government source said: ‘We don’t recognise the picture he has painted. It’s just Steve being Steve.’ But his description of life in No 10 is strikingly similar to that painted by Mr Cameron’s deputy chief of staff, Oliver Dowden, who said last year: ‘The first thing I do in the morning... is turn on the Today programme and hear what’s going on. Hopefully, we will have some sense of what’s coming up anyway, but often you’ll get surprised.’ Mr Cameron was critical of New Labour’s ‘control freak’ approach and determined to allow ministers more freedom. But No 10 has been wrong-footed by announcements on everything from selling off forests to scrapping school milk, which have had to be reversed.","Former strategy guru Steve Hilton said Cameron often opposes the measures his own ministers put forward .

David Willetts provoked outrage after he said older people should retrain so they can keep working . A minister has been condemned for suggesting that the over-60s should go to university and retrain so they can keep working. David Willetts, the Higher Education Minister, said older workers should keep their skills up to date by taking out loans to fund degrees. ‘Education is such a good thing it is not reserved for younger people,’ he said. ‘There will be people of all ages who will want to study. There is great value in lifelong learning.’ He added that there was now nothing to stop older people from applying for university as the ‘ageist’ limits on student loans for the over-55s had been lifted. The Government wants older people to stop simply studying for leisure and start taking vocational courses. But pensioner groups say the plan would put unfair pressure on people to run up huge debts to fund potentially futile degrees. Ros Altmann, a former government pensions adviser, said: ‘The average private pension pot is just under £30,000 in total, the same amount as a three-year degree. ‘For an older person who may never go on to earn more than £21,000 [the threshold before you start paying back student loans], it is a huge investment. ‘Many of them will never end up paying off their loans. Why should society be paying for them?’ Dr Altmann said older workers would be better off doing shorter courses, many of which could be provided by employers. Critics fear that graduates already struggling to find work will have to compete with older people for scarce jobs. Neil Duncan-Jordan of the National Pensioners Convention said: ‘At a time of rising youth unemployment, it seems counterproductive that they should be competing with the over-60s for scarce jobs. ‘Does David Willetts really think someone in their 60s will spend three years racking up £30,000 in debt when there are no guarantees the degree will lead to a job? The Government wants older people to stop studying for leisure and start taking vocational courses . ‘Older workers face invisible barriers of age discrimination in the workplace and studying for a degree will do nothing to resolve that.’ But Mr Willetts said: ‘There is certainly a pressure for continuing to get retrained and upskilled. ‘Higher education has an economic benefit in that if you stay up to date with knowledge and skills you are more employable.’ ‘The idea that you first study and then stop isn’t what the world is like any more.’ Of the 552,240 undergraduates in Britain last year, 1,940 were over 60 – only 0.35 per cent. Last year, Whitehall mandarin Lord Bichard suggested that the elderly should ‘earn’ their pensions by doing voluntary work in exchange for the payment. The former head of the Benefits Agency triggered fury when he suggested a series of rewards and fines should be used to make sure the elderly made a ‘useful contribution to civil society’. A quarter of Britons will be aged over 65 by 2033. To reflect this, the State pension age will rise to 67 in 2028.","David Willetts said older workers should keep their skills up to date .

A railway worker put the lives of passengers at risk by letting an untrained friend stand in for him for more than two weeks so he could study for a degree, a court has heard. Oluwaseun Oyesanya, 36, allowed Olutoba Olubode to wave off trains from station platforms even though he did not have a licence and had not been trained, Westminster Magistrates' Court heard. The hearing was told the deception could have led to a crash and passenger deaths if a train had been cleared to leave Denmark Hill Station at the wrong time. The deception took place between October 15 and 27 last year at Denmark Hill Station . He was standing in as a despatcher, . who conducts safety checks before trains depart and have to undergo . training and obtain a licence. Chair . of the bench Spyros Elia told Oyesanya it was 'but for the will of God . that somebody wasn't injured, perhaps even fatally, and maybe more than . one person.' Adjourning for sentencing, he said: 'I just cannot stress how serious this is. 'We . feel that the sentencing powers available to us in this court are not . sufficient to deal with it with the severity it deserves.' The ruse took place between October 15 and 27 last year, when Oyesanya,  who has no previous convictions, was employed at Denmark Hill Station by railway company Southeastern. He gave Olubode a fake identity badge, along with a personal crash course and a set of training books. Alec . Williams, prosecuting, said the measures let his friend 'effectively . home-school himself in how to become competent in despatching trains.'

Praise: Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt described the pathway as 'a fantastic step forward' An influential group of Christian doctors yesterday called for an end to financial ‘bribes’ that encourage hospitals to place dying patients on the controversial Liverpool Care Pathway. The Christian Medical Fellowship said judgments about whether to withdraw treatment from terminally-ill patients should be made solely on clinical grounds. The CMF, which represents more than 4,000 doctors, said financial incentives for hospitals to use the system – thought to run at more than £10million a year in total – should be ‘eradicated’ immediately. It also urged ministers to tighten controls to end the ‘undoubted abuses’ of a system designed to ensure patients die with dignity. Dr Jeff Stephenson, a Devon-based consultant in palliative care, said the care pathway could help ease suffering if used properly. But he added: ‘It remains a tool, and it is only as good as those who use it. There is always potential for misuse and abuse and there are undoubtedly instances where this occurs. ‘Where these arise by intention then those involved should be held to account, but more often they occur through poor understanding and inadequate training. ‘We owe it to patients to not only furnish the means to better care, but also to equip adequately those who provide it.’ Charles and Hilda Futcher died within ten days of one another after being put on sedatives while on Liverpool Care Pathway 'without family consent' The LCP was developed in a Liverpool hospital and has been in use across the NHS for the past four years. Payments to hospitals to introduce it are made through a system called Commissioning for Quality and Innovation, which channels money to hospital trusts through NHS ‘commissioners’. But ministers were forced to launch an independent review of the pathway in November following a public outcry about a string of disturbing cases in which people’s loved ones had their treatment, including food, fluids and medication, withdrawn without their knowledge or consent. They include a war veteran and his . wife who died within days of each other after being put on the Liverpool . Care Pathway without consent. Charles . Futcher, 90, who fought in the battle of El Alamein, died alone in a . care home after he was put on the controversial end-of-life process. Ten . days later his wife Hilda, 89, died in the same home after she too was . given sedatives and had vital food and fluids withdrawn under pathway . procedures. Their son, Charlie, said his parents had . been treated ‘like animals who needed to be put down’ by doctors who . ‘seemed to take it upon themselves to get rid of them’. In some cases, patients have survived for months or even years after their relatives fought to have their treatment restored. In a provocative intervention at the weekend, the Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt appeared to pre-judge his own inquiry by hailing the LCP as a ‘fantastic step forward’ for the dying. Mr Hunt said it should not be ‘discredited’ because of events ‘going wrong in one or two cases’. But . the CMF said a number of urgent steps were needed to restore public . confidence in a system used in around 130,000 cases a year. Hospitals are thought to have been rewarded with an extra £30million over the past three years for increasing their use of the LCP. The CMF said these payments should be ended, with the cash diverted into better training for staff. It . said: ‘Non-clinical priorities in the use of the pathway, especially . financial priorities, must be eradicated and every patient treated . solely according to their need.’ The organisation also said no patient should be placed on the LCP unless they were ‘imminently dying’. Assessments should only be made by senior doctors and the decision should be discussed with patients and their families. Anyone placed on the pathway who shows signs of improvement should be taken off it immediately. A . shocking national audit recently revealed that up to 60,000 people die . on the LCP every year without ever being told their treatment is being . withdrawn, despite being conscious when doctors make the decision. The CMF also called for an annual audit of the care pathway to ensure it is being used properly. Cases . of abuse should be reported to the appropriate medical body, such as . the General Medical Council, for possible disciplinary action.","Christian Medical Fellowship said financial incentives should be 'eradicated'

Strategy: Ed Miliband's advisers say a coalition of core voters and disaffected Lib Dems could put the Labour leader in Downing Street . Ed Miliband could seize power with just 35 per cent of the vote, senior Labour figures calculate. Advisers to the Labour leader say a coalition of core voters and disaffected Liberal Democrats could put him in Downing Street. They point out that Tony Blair secured his third term in office with just over 35 per cent of the vote. Supporters claim the so-called '35 per cent strategy' would allow Mr Miliband to ignore the concerns of Middle England and focus on the demands of the unions and the Left. But the idea dismayed the party's remaining Blairites, who warn it would be disastrous to ignore the needs of the majority of the country even if they were not vital to secure power. Supporters of the approach believe Labour's core support is about 29 per cent of the electorate, with Lib Dem defections likely to boost that figure by at least six per cent in 2015. With the Lib Dems scuppering attempts to reform Britain's electoral system, Labour also still enjoys an inbuilt electoral advantage. Details of the plan emerged as Mr Miliband moved to kill off a Blairite revolt against his leadership. Mr Miliband has struggled to hide his irritation at an intervention from Mr Blair last week in which he warned Labour was in danger of becoming a protest party. The two men will hold private talks this week in a bid to agree a public truce. But, at a meeting of Labour MPs, Mr Miliband made it clear he had no truck with Mr Blair's criticisms. 'New Labour was formed 19 years ago,' he said. 'Tony Blair taught us the world changes, and the world does change, and we will learn our lessons.' Minority: The 35 per cent strategy would allow Mr Miliband to focus on demand of the unions and the Left . He likened Labour to a football team that is 'ahead at half time... with the ball still at our feet'. One supporter of the Labour leader dismissed Mr Blair out of hand. 'When did Tony Blair last knock on doors in Redditch?' the MP said. 'I'm not sure how much he knows about what the British public feel from the first-class lounge at Heathrow Terminal 5.' Irritation: Tony Blair warned last week that Labour was in danger of becoming a protest party . But former Home Secretary David Blunkett - one of a number of former Cabinet ministers to back Mr Blair - last night said: 'The idea that you don't learn from a leader who won three elections is risible'. Sources close to Mr Miliband last night insisted he would not pursue a strategy that targeted only 35 per cent of the voters. 'There is no 35 per cent strategy,' the source said. But the Labour commentator Dan Hodges said the approach was being actively discussed at the top of the party. He added: 'For all the talk of One Nation, Labour's leader thinks that if he can convince just 35 per cent of voters to give his party the benefit of the doubt in 2015, he'll win. Tony Blair is not alone in thinking it's a strategy that is fundamentally flawed.' Former Tory treasurer Lord Ashcroft said the 'unambitious' 35 per cent target showed that Mr Miliband knew Labour's opinion poll lead was 'soft'. He said Labour appeared to be 'turning away from reality' by opposing every cut put forward by the Government. In a further development the former minister John Denham - champion of the argument that Labour must win in the South of England - yesterday resigned as Mr Miliband's Parliamentary aide. Mr Denham said he wanted to focus on beefing up Labour's campaign in the South. He dismissed the idea that Labour should pursue a 35 per cent strategy even if that could deliver power. 'The whole challenge for us is not just to win our target seats but to establish ourselves again as a significant political force in the south of England. Our ambitions go way beyond our target seats.'","Strategy would allow Ed Miliband to ignore the concerns of Middle England .

Mrs Hutchings, Tory candidate in the Eastleigh by-election, became embroiled in controversy after saying she may put her son William into private education. Maria Hutchings, Tory Eastleigh by-election candidate, pictured with William Hague, has been defended by Grant Shapps after she said she was considering sending her 'gifted' son to private school . The outspoken mother of four said: ‘William is very gifted, which gives us another interesting challenge in finding the right sort of education for him – impossible in the state system. He wants to be a cardio-respiratory surgeon.’ The Lib Dems and Labour seized on her remarks as evidence that she was out of touch with voters. Labour leader Ed Miliband wrote on Twitter: ‘Comments from Maria Hutchings totally wrong. An insult to every state school in the country. And all of their pupils.’ But Mr Shapps yesterday warned rivals against making a political issue out of what was a personal choice. He pointed out that Mrs Hutchings, her husband and three of her children attended state schools. ‘I really believe that as politicians we have to be responsible and not try to drag children into by-elections,’ he said. ‘Every parent wants the best for their child, and whether that’s Nick Clegg or Ed Miliband or Maria Hutchings or myself, I mean, I think it’s perfectly reasonable to look for the best option for your children. ‘But she’s got four children and two or three of them are in the state system. I think that rather illustrates that she believes in it.’ Grant Shapps said children should not be 'dragged into by-elections' and said Hutchings just wanted best for her child . Tory sources accused the Lib Dems of dirty tricks, pointing out that their leader, Mr Clegg, went to the leading public school Westminster and is  considering sending his eldest son to a private school. Mr Clegg, who has spoken about the ‘corrosive’ influence of private schools on society, said he did not want his own son’s education to become a ‘political football’. But a Lib Dem source insisted the criticism of Mrs Hutchings was legitimate. ‘As a parent she is perfectly entitled to send her children to a school of her choice,’ he said. ‘What she should not do is say it is impossible to get a decent state education in the area.’ The by-election in the seat vacated by disgraced ex-Lib Dem minister Chris Huhne is on February 28.","Eastleigh by-election candidate Maria Hutchings said son William may go to private school because educating him in the public sector was 'impossible'

Ministers have signalled a u-turn over their promised crackdown on high-stakes gambling machines, despite warnings they are as addictive as ‘crack cocaine’. Hugh Robertson, the minister for sport, has ruled out immediate action on fixed-odds betting terminals, or FOBTs, despite recent pledges that the Government would tackle the high-street scourge. Mr Robertson insisted the Government was ‘seriously concerned about problem gambling’, but told the Commons there was a ‘lack of evidence’ that the terminals were a ‘major problem’. Labour have admitted it was a mistake to introduce the fixed odds betting machines, which they claim are as addictive as 'crack cocaine' He called for more research and told MPs that ‘once the problem is proved to exist, the Government will act’. Labour MPs are calling for a total ban on FOBTs, warning that gambling ‘ruins lives and destroys families’. Mr Robertson’s decision flies in the face of previous pledges made by ministers. The Coalition ‘quad’ of David . Cameron, Nick Clegg, George Osborne and Danny Alexander agreed last year . to reject a call from the Commons culture committee for a relaxation of . ‘puritanical’ gambling laws. Labour's Harriet Harman and David Lammy called on the government to act to curb the high stakes machines . In July the committee said councils . should approve more casinos, which should be allowed to provide up to 20 . high-stakes gambling machines. A bookmaker became hooked on slot machines after playing them ‘for fun’ at work – and ended up stealing £20,000 from her bosses. Lorraine Bennett (left) began playing the machines at the Glasgow shop where she worked using her staff card, before progressing to using her own money. Soon she was embezzling from the shop by cashing in fake winning slips. At trial, Bennett, 27, received three years’ probation and was ordered to get counselling and do 225 hours of community service. But ministers indicated that they . would rebuff the proposals, and ordered a review of stake levels, . numbers of FOBTs and the prizes offered. FOBTs are either slot or virtual . roulette machines with maximum payouts of £500 per bet. The slot . machines allow a spin every three seconds, and customers can wager as . much as £2 per bet. The virtual roulette machine allows . three spins per minute – at a maximum bet of £100 per spin – meaning . punters can wager as much as £18,000 in one hour. At least £46billion is . expected to be staked on the machines this year. Labour claimed MPs are ‘up in arms’ at Mr Robertson’s decision because ‘we are seeing the victims’ in communities. Harriet Harman, the shadow culture . secretary, demanded action, saying: ‘We all know – there is bags of . evidence that gambling is blighting people’s lives, and blighting our . high streets too, given the prevalence of betting shops.’ Labour MP Kelvin Hopkins said: ‘Compulsive gambling ruins lives and destroys families.’ David Lammy, another Labour MP, told .

The 25-year-old is the first person to die in the measles epidemic and his mother Angela Colfer said her son should have been admitted to hospital before his death on Thursday. Gareth Williams (right), from Swansea, South Wales, was suffering from measles when he died at his home . His family said Gareth, pictured with partner Cairo, was seen by an out-of-hours GP the day before he died . Mr Colfer-Williams, who also suffered . from asthma, lived in the Pont Tennant area of Swansea, which is at the . centre of the epidemic area. There are more than 800 confirmed cases of the disease in the Swansea outbreak that has left at least 77 in hospital. A record number of people in the area have now been inoculated against measles as authorities try to get the epidemic under control. Health officials have also warned the public to expect more people to die from the disease. Mrs . Colfer, 53, said she took her son to the doctors on Wednesday but he . was found dead at his home by girlfriend Cairo Oneim the following day. She said: 'He could barely stand but he didn’t have any rash on his arms then. 'He was seen by three GPs who had a look at him and all gave him a prescription of paracetamol. 'He should have been admitted that night.' Mrs Colfer said the family are devastated by his death and urged parents to vaccinate their children. She said: 'It’s a terrible, unbearable feeling and our lives will never ever be the same. 'I only had one son and I could not have wished for a better, more loving, loyal son. I was very proud of him. 'He was the best father, son, brother and partner anyone could wish for and he was besotted with his baby daughter Dakota. She has lost her dad and Cairo has lost her partner.' She added: 'Get your children vaccinated and get yourselves vaccinated. I wouldn't want anyone to go through the tragedy that we are going through. 'Gareth has taken part of us with him and we can never get it back.' Health officials confirmed Mr Colfer-Williams had measles when he died and a post-mortem is being held to determine whether the disease contributed to his death. The Port Tennant house in which Gareth Colfer- Williams died after being discharged from hospital . Mr Colfer-Williams had recently been treated at Morriston Hospital but Public Health Wales said that he was not treated for measles or diagnosed with the contagious disease by a GP before his death. A PHW spokeswoman said: 'Measles is a notifiable disease, so by law if a doctor or GP diagnoses a case of measles they have to notify us. 'If he had been diagnosed with measles before his death we would have known about it. 'We ran tests following his death to see if he had measles because he had the symptoms of the disease when he died. 'And the post mortem tests showed he had measles at the time of his death.' It is now almost six months since the first measles cases emerged in the greater Swansea area where the epidemic is centred. The disease was slow to spread before Christmas but the number of cases rose with alarming rapidity from the start of March. A private clinic, which has a centre in Swansea, and offers single vaccinations for measles and rubella has been criticised for . suggesting a link between autism and the MMR jab. Two million children are believed to be at risk of catching measles as a result of the MMR scare. Teenagers aged between 13 and 15 are . more likely to be susceptible to measles because of the controversy over . the since-discredited report about MMR jabs being linked to autism in . the late 1990s. The measles epidemic has already infected more than 800 people in South Wales . Former doctor Andrew Wakefield's report in the 1990s first suggested a link between the triple vaccine and bowel disease and autism. His research was later discredited and he was struck off in 2010. However, doctors have warned that unfounded fears about the vaccination has left children unprotected. Ten years ago, 45 per cent of . five-year-olds in London failed to have the required two doses of . vaccine. Last year the figure was 81 per cent. The Children's Immunisation Centre is offering single measles and rubella vaccinations in Swansea for up to £110. A full course costs up to £730, while the MMR is free on the NHS. The centre says on its website that 'single MMR vaccination is recommended' and tells parents to 'be wise' and choose individual jabs. The company, which has clinics in London, Swansea, Birmingham and Manchester, says: 'We believe that our approach and the vaccines we use are the safest for . your child  in order to be protected from the Measles Mumps and Rubella . (German Measles) diseases.' However, no single mumps vaccine is currently available in the UK. Last year, the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency ordered the company to remove advertisements for a mumps vaccine as the agency considers it unsafe. An agency spokesman told The Sunday Times: 'We have significant concerns about the quality of the single mumps vaccine that the Children's Immunisation Centre (CIC) is attempting to supply.' CIC director Fiona Dickson defended her company and said there is a link between the MMR and autism. She told The Sunday Times: 'Autism is running at one in 66 for boys in . England. Are we going to ignore these women, these parents?' She added that the mumps vaccine produced by her company abroad was safe. The Abertawe Bro Morgannwg University Health Board has administered vaccinations to thousands of people at drop-in clinics throughout Swansea, Neath Port Talbot and Bridgend to try and bring the epidemic under control. The NHS is running drop-in clinics for parents to get their children immunised . More than 1,800 people were vaccinated yesterday as people flocked to the clinics, possibly driven by heightened fear after the disease claimed its first victim. Due to the success of the weekend vaccination sessions health chiefs announced they will be held for a further weekend as well. An Abertawe Bro Morgannwg University (ABMU) Health Board spokesman said: 'Over 1,800 people were vaccinated at ABMU Health Board's four drop-in MMR clinics today - the highest number yet. 'Many of the 1,825 given MMR jabs were older schoolchildren, teenagers and young adults, as well as babies and toddlers having their vaccinations earlier than normal during the measles outbreak.' Sara Hayes, ABMU's director of public health, said she was delighted with the turn out. 'I'm really pleased. We have seen a steady flow of people throughout the day; and I'm particularly delighted to see a higher number of older children and teenagers come through the door, as they are our main target group.'","Gareth Colfer-Williams, 25, died at his Swansea flat on Thursday .

They were the band who played on as the Titanic began to sink, but their instruments were thought to be long lost at the bottom of the ocean. Experts now believe, however, they have now discovered the violin belonging to heroic Titanic band master Wallace Hartley. Tests are taking place to establish whether the violin did belong to Mr Hartley, who perished along with the rest of his eight-man band when the doomed ship went down. Gallant: Wallace Hartley, pictured front row, fourth from left with violin in the Bridlington Municipal Orchestra, was one of the brave band members who played on as the Titanic sank . The band leader was said to have been found with his violin strapped to his chest after the Titanic sank on April 15, 1912. But there was no mention of the instrument in records of his effects, and its whereabouts had remained a mystery ever since. The person claiming to own the violin lives in the UK, but is not a relative of Mr Hartley. The owner said the band master's fiancee, Maria Robinson, was given the instrument after the Titanic tragedy 100 years ago. If it was put up for sale it would smash the record for a Titanic artifact, currently set by the post office keys which went for £101,000 in 2007. Defiant: The band play on as the Titanic begins to sink in a scene from James Cameron's 1997 film version of the events . All eight members of the band that gallantly played as passengers lined up for evacuation to the life-boats perished in the disaster but the bodies of the band leader and two other musicians were pulled from the water by a search crew from the CS Mackay-Bennett and taken to Nova Scotia, Canada. Violinist John Law Hume from Dumfries in Scotland and bass player John Frederick Preston Clarke from Liverpool were laid to rest in Halifax but Hartley’s body was repatriated to England and buried at Colne, Lancashire, the town where he was born and raised. Newspapers at the time reported that Hartley was found fully dressed with his violin strapped to his chest. However, when the effects of Body 224 were itemised by The Office of the Provincial Secretary in Nova Scotia there was no mention of it. Other than his clothes and spare change he had only a ring, a pen, a silver matchbox, a gold cigar holder, a watch and chain, a collar stud, a pair of scissors and two pieces of correspondence. It was not among the possessions handed back to his father Albion Hartley who collected the body from the Arabic at Liverpool docks. The assumption has long been that the instrument was spirited away by someone involved in collecting the corpses. Wallace Hartley had become engaged around 1910 to a girl named Maria Robinson. She was left bereft by her fiancis death, moved to the Yorkshire seaside resort of Bridlington, and never married. She died alone in 1939. The unnamed person who now owns the violin claims that Robinson retrieved the violin after Hartley’s death. Among the supporting evidence is a 1912 diary where she has apparently drafted a letter to the authorities in Nova Scotia thanking them for acceding to her wish to have the violin sent to her. The draft letter in Maria Robinson’s diary reads: 'I would be most grateful if you could convey my heartfelt thanks to all who have made possible the return of my late fiance’s violin. Ill-fated: The gigantic liner famously sank on April 15, 1912 after hitting an iceberg . Watery tomb: The bow of the Titanic at rest on the bottom of the North Atlantic, about 400 miles southeast of Newfoundland . 'May I take this opportunity to express my appreciation to you personally for your gracious intervention on my behalf.' The violin itself was stored in a brown leather case with the initials W.H.H stamped on it and an inscription on the tail piece reading: ‘For Wallace on the occasion of our engagement from Maria.’ Now the instrument believed to be Hartley’s is currently being handled by leading Titanic memorabilia auctioneer Henry Aldridge and Son. The Devizes-based firm hold every record set for items from the ship and are considered the world’s leading authority on its artifacts. They have so far spent thousands of pounds seeking to establish beyond any doubt that the violin is the genuine article. Mr Henry Aldridge said today: 'We are waiting the results of further laboratory tests. When I first saw it five years ago I was amazed. If I did not think that the probability was there I would not have bothered. 'The research is expensive business but because of the historical importance of this item the money is secondary. 'The owner has not made up their mind if they would want to sell it but I think it is more likely it will go on exhibition - if it is proved to be genuine. 'We hope to have a definite answer sometime this year. We cannot rush the scientists.'","Instrument from band was handed to owner's fiancee after he died on ship .

G4S’s ‘management fee’ for the Olympics was increased almost tenfold to £60million despite the firm failing to provide enough security staff to protect London 2012. Games organisers Locog agreed to raise it from £7.3 million to £60million, according to secret documents revealed today. Almost £34million of the rise was for the G4S ‘programme management office’ to oversee the security operation, but it was so poorly handled 3,500 armed forces staff have now had to be rushed in. It came as it also emerged hundreds of A-level students have been hired as front-line guards at the Games to fill the security void when it starts in two weeks. Claims: G4S has allegedly increased its management fees almost tenfold despite failing to find enough staff to secure venues like the Olympic Stadium . They are among 3,300 teenagers recruited from colleges around Britain to help form a ring of steel at the venues for £8.50 an hour. Security experts expressed alarm that youngsters aged 18 and 19 had been entrusted with searching spectators and bags. G4S' management fee is thought to be almost ten times the amount that the firm has invested in recruiting security personnel for the games. It was initially estimated by the Home Office that 10,000 security staff would be needed for the Olympics. G4S was contracted to provide 2,000 of those staff in 2010 at a cost of £86 million. Falling short: G4S admitted it could not supply the 10,000 guards it promised to deliver but has raised its management fee to £60million . But when the overall number of personnel required for the Games rose to 23,500 last year, G4S was asked to provide 10,400 recruits. Under the new contract with Locog, the organisers of London 2012, the security company’s overall fee rose to £284 million. The contract stipulated that G4S should train 3,300 students and 2,500 unpaid workers. A steward sub-contracted to work for under-fire security provider G4S at the British Grand Prix was arrested for stealing a camera from a spectator’s bag. The man, believed to be from London, was arrested after a visitor to the Silverstone race realised the camera was missing from his bag. Northamptonshire Police have today confirmed they investigated the incident and arrested the man. He was later issued with a reprimand. The camera was later returned to the rightful owner. But their management fee for recruiting civilian staff rose from £7.3 million to £60 million, according to documents seen by the Daily Telegraph, . However, the documents show that the firm’s spending on recruitment only increased by £2.8 million in the same period. In a statement to ITV’s Tonight programme, G4S said they had been ‘absolutely transparent with Locog throughout’. The company said that the ‘revised proposal was subject to rigorous scrutiny and extensive negotiation…to ensure value for money.’ The firm also said that the amended contract gives ‘significantly improved terms’ and that there are ‘caps on any profit that we will make’. Meanwhile the beleaguered security firm suffered further share price falls today amid fears that the Olympics debacle will permanently damage its reputation. Its shares fell 3% on top of similar falls yesterday, meaning more than £200 million has been wiped off its value since the staffing problems emerged. Meanwhile, there are fears that chief executive Nick Buckles, who will be hauled before MPs next week, will be forced out. He survived the collapse of a £5.2 billion takeover deal for Danish cleaning giant ISS last year after a shareholder rebellion scuppered the move, but the latest debacle has put his position under renewed pressure. Seymour Pierce analyst Caroline de La Soujeole said: 'In terms of numbers, the Olympics won't make much difference to people's full-year forecasts. Financially, it's nothing significant. 'People are not worried about numbers but about impact on reputation, which is hard to quantify. 'Potentially, there's a danger it could lose further contracts. And there is the question is that the end for Nick Buckles?' G4S's revenues hit £7.5 billion last year, while underlying profits grew 2% to £531 million and analysts said any shortfall from the Olympics contract would not hurt the company. Ms de La Soujeole believes the company's growth prospects remain strong because it is set to benefit from the public sector's austerity drive as more authorities look to outsource work. Last year, for example, G4S started running Birmingham prison, and a contract to run Oakwood prison in Wolverhampton started in April. And G4S won a ground-breaking £200 million contract to design and run a station for Lincolnshire Police, including running cells, administering drug tests and managing the force's vehicle fleet. A retired police officer who was turned down by Olympic company G4S was given an access all areas pass anyway in a ‘massive breach’ of security. Ian Glendinning, a veteran of 32 years with Northumbria Police, was invited to collect his Olympic pass, despite being turned down for a job with the security  company. The 55-year-old applied for a job with G4S in January and was told he had landed a role as a group leader during the games. But his job offer was rescinded because he was unable to attend training dates, and just hours later he was sent an e-mail inviting him to collect his security pass in Newcastle. Mr Glendinning claims that the pass, bearing the G4S logo, gives him access to secure sites across the Olympic Park but said it could easily have been obtained by falsifying documents. Last night he branded it as a ‘spectacular failure’ on the part of the organising chiefs despite the fact checks that had been made on a five-year history he provided them with. Mr Glendinning, who works as an assistant manager at the Clennell Hall Hotel in Alwinton, Northumberland, said: 'Last Friday they emailed me saying I had been scheduled on training courses, but it would be in London. 'I was told I would be group leader supervisor, supervising the entrances, exits and pedestrian search areas. 'But when I couldn’t go to that training, they said I wouldn’t be able to do the job. 'It was unspeakable stupidity, but then I got an email asking me to go and collect my accreditation.' Mr Glendinning said he was disappointed by the levels of security at the games. He said: 'I’ve got a background in anti-terrorism, I was in the special unit for 20 years dealing with firearms and intelligence gathering. 'I got my licence from the Security Industry Authority, in 2006 after I retired from Northumbria Police. 'I must be one of the most experienced applicants that they have but because the system is so unfit for purpose I now won’t be there. 'They are not fulfilling the role that they are supposed to. 'The Olympics are going to be staffed by young inexperienced people who have no background in security.'","Its original fee was only £7.3 million but London 2012 chiefs have agreed to bump it up because more staff were needed .

Dedicated: Prince Philip, pictured at Sunday mass in Sandringham this week, has attended more Royal engagements this year than last despite his ill health . He made his dedication to his role clear when he stood in the wind and rain for hours during the Thames Diamond Jubilee Pageant. And despite repeatedly battling ill health, the Duke of Edinburgh carried out more official engagements over the past 12 months than he did the previous year. Prince Philip, 91, conducted more than  340 official jobs in 2012, up from around  330 in 2011. His recent bouts of ill health have led to concerns that he is doing too much. He began the year with strict instructions from doctors to rest after undergoing emergency heart surgery for a blocked artery. In June, he suffered a serious bladder infection, believed to have been aggravated by the bad conditions at the river pageant. In August, the infection returned and he spent another five days in hospital. It is known that the Queen wants her husband to take life a little easier but Philip is not one to heed such advice. The Queen, who is herself 86, is equally busy – conducting more than 370 engagements over the past year, a slight rise on 2011. Although she is gradually cutting back on her public commitments, it is clear she is also determined to uphold her strong work ethic. Prince Charles and Princess Anne continue to be the hardest-working members of the Royal Family, conducting just under 600 engagements each over the past year. Although Charles’s total is slightly down on the previous year, aides say this was largely due to three foreign tours which involved several days of travel. The Duchess of Cornwall expanded her diary, carrying out more than 270 official engagements – a rise of nearly 12 per cent on 2011.

A senior Labour MP was accused of sexism yesterday after remarking on Theresa May’s ‘thin’ appearance – and suggesting her stressful job may have caused weight loss. Keith Vaz, chairman of the Commons home affairs committee, was condemned by female MPs over his comments  on Twitter about the Home Secretary’s figure. ‘A bit worried about Home Secretary, she is looking a bit thin these days. A new diet or pressure of work?’ he wrote. Vaz described Home Secretary Theresa May, pictured here in 2010 (left) and 2012 (right),  as 'a bit thin' His remarks caused a backlash from Mrs May’s colleagues, one of whom said Mr Vaz should ‘concentrate on his own waistline’. Another, equalities minister Helen Grant insisted: ‘She looks fantastic, she is fantastic. She works incredibly hard. Would the same be said of a male MP?’ Conservative MP for Romsey, Caroline Nokes, chairman of the all-party group on body image, said Mr Vaz’s remarks were ‘particularly thoughtless’. ‘I think they came across as rather patronising,’ she said. ‘I’m reasonably confident as a woman in politics who has had to bear the brunt of comments about my own weight that this is something that dished out to women MPs and simply isn’t to the same extent to men. ‘I’m very conscious that I have an interesting relationship with food - my weight goes up and down, and people will frequently comment that either I’m looking a bit chubby or have lost a bit of weight. Keith Vaz took to Twitter to make the 'thoughtless' comments about Mrs May . ‘I think it’s sexist. The remark that . Keith very unfortunately put on Twitter was that this was about a woman . who was losing weight because of the pressure of work. It is no secret . that Theresa has taken up a regime of healthy eating, has been walking a . lot and has lost weight.’ Conservative . MP Harriett Baldwin said: ‘Twitter is a medium that people say silly . things on. I’m sure he would apologise if he thought about it.’ Keith Vaz has been criticised by May's colleagues over his remarks about the Home Secretary's appearance . Mrs . May, 56, is thought to have lost a stone and a half over the last year, . having gone on a diet and been working out regularly in the gym. She . also enjoys energetic holidays in Switzerland, where she goes mountain . walking. The Home Secretary . is fiercely protective of her private life, rarely giving personal . interviews, and her admirers have been irritated by the focus on her . celebrated kitten-heeled shoes. There . has been increasing speculation that she could succeed David Cameron as . Conservative leader, having impressed with her steely grip on the Home . Office, which was a political graveyard for a series of Labour . ministers. Earlier this . week, Mark Reckless, one of the leaders of a Eurosceptic revolt over the .

The cruise ship industry might have hit rough seas this year, following a number of disasters with luxury liners, but one company is pulling out all the stops to lure customers back off dry land. Royal Caribbean International unveiled its new Quantum class of ships today, and gimmicks to attract cruisers to the sea include sky diving and bumper cars. It will be the first ship to offer guests a simulated sky diving experience - as well as a new thrilling capsule ride called North Star that climbs to 300 feet above sea level. Attractions on board: This computer-generated image provided by the Royal Caribbean International cruise line shows a bumper car attraction planned for the forthcoming ship, Quantum of the Seas . A jewel-shaped glass capsule will hold 14 people and go over the side of the ship, offering passengers unobstructed views. Interior staterooms that don't traditionally don't have a view will have a ""virtual balcony"" — an 80-inch LED screen providing real-time views of the ocean or port. Families will also be able to book three different types of staterooms that can connect in various layouts. For entertainment there will be bumper cars, roller skating and a circus school with a flying trapeze. ""This new generation of ships gave us an opportunity to make another leap in vessel design. ''Innovation has always been part of our DNA and we have taken advantage of all that creativity to design Quantum cruising,"" Richard D. Fain, chairman and CEO, Royal Caribbean Cruises, Ltd. said in a statement. The vessel: Quantum of the Seas is seen cruising through the seas in this computer-generated image - set to debut in 2014 . Vantage point: A jewel-shaped glass capsule will hold 14 people and go over the side of the ship and then climb to 300 feet above the sea . The Quantum class will debut in fall 2014 with Quantum of the Seas, followed by sister ship Anthem of the Seas in spring 2015. Quantum ships span 18 decks, encompass 167,800 gross registered tons, carry 4,180 guests at double occupancy and feature 2,090 staterooms. The ships will initially be based out of Cape Liberty Cruise Port in Bayonne, N.J. Potential cruise ship customers might be apprehensive about taking to the seas though after the Carnival Cruise disaster in February. Thousands of passengers and crew had to endure five days at sea with no power and under squalid conditions while the 900-foot vessel was towed to Mobile, Alabama. And even this month, another cruise - The Crown Princess - was forced to return to Galveston, Texas, after toilets broke down during the seven-day Caribbean cruise to Honduras, Belize and Cozumel.

A Missouri mother is suing for the cost of raising her one-year-old daughter after she fell pregnant due to a botched course of her birth control pill. Shanta Russell, 33, was stunned when a pregnancy test she took in June 2011 came up positive despite the fact she'd religiously taken the contraceptive pill for more than 12 years. Three months later, she received a recall notice in the mail from Qualitest Pharmaceuticals informing her that the birth control pills had mistakenly been put in the wrong order in the blister pack, rendering the drug ineffective. Lawsuit: Missouri mother Shanta Russell is suing for the cost of raising her one-year-old daughter after she fell pregnant due to a botched course of her birth control pill, pictured . The single Kansas City woman gave birth to her daughter in early 2012 and on February 6 filed a lawsuit against Qualitest in Jackson County Circuit Court, according to The Kansas City Star. She said she was a workaholic with two jobs and that motherhood was a distant possibility, not something she wanted so soon. She said she didn't want to have an abortion. Russell is demanding compensation for healthcare costs, expenses incurred in bringing up the little girl and damages for the emotional pain inflicted on her from the unwanted pregnancy. She is also suing Qualitest's parent company and the firm that packaged the drugs. 'I was devastated,' Russell told The Star. 'I questioned myself. After all these years, how could this happen? Then I received a letter in the mail. Of course I was angry. There was nothing I did that was a mistake.' Court: The lawsuit was filed in Jackson County Circuit Court, pictured, on February 6 . The packaging errors meant that placebo pills, which should be taken when a woman has a period, were put in the packs at a point in a woman's cycle where pills containing hormones, or active pills, should have been. The company's recall was followed by . similar blunders from pharmaceutical companies Pfizer, Glenmark Generics and Sandoz. Together, . millions of botched blister packs were distributed to pharmacies, likely . resulting in scores of unwanted pregnancies. A spokesman for Endo Pharmaceuticals, Qualitest’s parent company, refused to comment on the pending case. The company has been hit with lawsuits from women in California, Tennessee and Texas who became pregnant while taking the pills. Qualitest: The packaging errors meant that placebo pills, that should be taken when a woman has a period, were put in the packs at a point in a woman's cycle where pills containing hormones, or active pills, should have been . A class-action has been proposed in Georgia where around 200 women are claiming to have become pregnant because of the incorrect packaging. According to The Star, these women included some who were forced to drop out of nursing or law school and a woman in the military who gave up her baby for adoption because she was about to be deployed overseas. Russell said the pregnancy thrust upon her has been life-changing, and brought about expenses such as baby clothes, medical appointments and in time, education. She is also unable to travel. 'When you have a kid you have to rearrange your life. You have to cut back on things,' she said. But she said she adores her little girl. 'She has an amazing personality. She's the happiest child,' Russell told The Star. 'She's the most precious thing that ever happened.

A woman who developed anorexia during her first year of university - and at her lowest point didn't care if she lived or died - has turned her life around by putting on three stone, and is now a finalist in a lingerie modelling competition for curvy women. Alice Jackson, 26, suffered from depression shortly after beginning her retail course at Bournemouth University in 2006. The London-based fashion researcher became obsessed with her weight and went running for up to two hours every day, eating just a handful of lettuce leaves at night. Scroll down for video . Alice Jackson pictured in 2007, left, when her life was controlled by counting calories and long running sessions, and now, right, as a finalist in Curvy Kate's annual 'star in a bra' competition . Her weight plummeted from 9st 11lbs to a dangerously low 7st 10lbs in just three months - four stone below the recommended healthy weight for her 5ft 9ins frame - and she shrunk to a size six dress size. Alice finally decided to get help after her parents told her she was too thin when she returned home to Norwich in June 2006. Her university GP referred her to a hospital who confirmed she was anorexic, and she spent a year receiving counselling with the Somerset and Wessex Eating Disorders Association (SWEDA), eventually getting back to a healthy weight. Alice now weighs 11 stone and has been chosen as a finalist for fuller-figure lingerie firm Curvy Kate's annual 'Star in a Bra' competition after her friends entered her into the contest. Alice, pictured left in 2007, says during her illness she was so thin she could feel all her bones when she lay in bed at night, but now, right, she is body-confident and happy with her size . Alice, who has a 30FF bust, said: 'It started when I was in my first year of university when I was 18. I started to put on a lot of weight and wasn't confident so I went home at Christmas and decided to go on a diet. 'It spiralled into cutting down my food and over-exercising, and before I knew it I was eating very little. I was controlled by not eating so my weight went down pretty rapidly. 'When I got to June and I was doing Race for Life, my parents were like ""you're too thin, you need to see someone"". 'I didn't feel well, I felt really ill and had no energy because I was eating so little and starving myself and over-exercising so running on empty. That was a really difficult summer. It's a horrible thing to be trapped in your thoughts about food and weight. I felt really really depressed and I didn't care if I died, I just felt awful, all I could think about was food and calories.' Alice's friends entered her into Curvy Kate's annual lingerie competition, and she was surprised when she was shortlisted . During the height of her eating disorder Alice admits that she so depressed from constant calorie-counting that she didn't care if she died, but is now so happy with her curves that she allowed friends to enter her into a lingerie modelling competition . At the hospital doctors told Alice she would only feel better if she began eating properly, so Alice took their advice and started taking better care of herself, reaching a healthy weight by the end of her second year of university. She said: 'By the end I had got to a healthy weight. I was still slim but I wasn't controlled by calories.' Alice during her battle with anorexia . Alice, who lives in London and is single, has worked in the fashion industry as a footwear researcher for the last 15 months. She said: 'My weight has gone up gradually but I've been at 11 stones for a good year and a half. I feel happy with myself, my body feels like it's at its natural shape. 'When I was anorexic I used to lie in bed and could feel all my bones. It was just a really horrible time to be so trapped, I thought I would never get better. 'It's so nice to be able to eat again and to be able to have things because I was so strict with myself before.

Its distinctive sirens would have been heard moments before it dropped the bombs over Poland that set the Second World War in motion. But despite its important role in history, very few German Stuka dive bombers survive to this day. There are currently only two complete planes still around - and neither on display in Germany. But now German military divers are . working to hoist the wreck of one of the single-engine monoplanes from . the floor of the Baltic Sea. Bombs away: German divers retrieve pieces of the Stuka dive bomber from the Baltic sea . Terror of the skies: The Stuka wreaked havoc over Europe as part of the Nazi war machine . Initial reports are that it is in good condition despite having spent the past seven decades lying on the seabed. The wreck, first discovered in the . 1990s when a fisherman's nets snagged on it, lies about 10 kilometers . off the coast of the German Baltic island of Ruegen, in about 60 feet of . water. The divers have been working over the . past week to prepare the bomber to be hoisted to the surface, using . fire hoses to carefully free it from the sand. They have already brought up smaller pieces and also hauled up its motor over the weekend. Captain Sebastian Bangert, from the . German Military Historical Museum in Dresden, which is running the . recovery operation, said they were now working to free the main 30ft . fuselage piece and expect to bring it to the surface on Tuesday, . depending on the weather. The German Military Historical Museum . plans to eventually display the Stuka at its Air Force Museum, located . at the former Gatow airport in Berlin. Capt Bangert said: 'From my . perspective there's a lot of damage - it's been under water for 70 years . - but our restoration crew says it's in really good condition for being . restored. 'That's our goal - a complete restoration and not conservation as a wreck.' War machine: Workers unload the engine complete with wooden propeller from the striken 'Stuka' Artefact: A penknife that was recovered out of the wreckage of the feared WWII plane . So far, little is known about this . particular plane - when it crashed, who its pilot and gunner were and . whether they survived the crash is still a mystery. Once the plane is brought to the surface, researchers will use the serial number to track down this information. The Junkers JU87 - known by most as . the Stuka, which is short for the German word for dive bomber . 'Sturzkampfflugzeug' - first saw service in the 1936-1939 Spanish Civil . War, being sent by Hitler to help the fascists. The only two known complete Stukas . are on display at the Royal Air Force Museum in London and at the Museum . of Science and Industry in Chicago. Both are later models. Bangert said from the motor, the one just found is also likely a later model 'JU87D.' Still, to find such a complete example is 'terrific,' said Andrew Simpson, curator of the aircraft collection at the RAF Museum. 'You are still talking about less . than a dozen in the world, even if you include every back end and center . section found on the Russian steppes,' he said. 'Any Stuka is good.' Following its service in Spain, . Stukas fired the first shots of the Second World War, dropping Nazi . bombs on the Polish town of Wielun on September 1, 1939, killing some . 1,200 civilians. Find: The wreck which was first discovered in the 1990s when a . fisherman's nets snagged on it, lay about 10 kilometers off the coast of . the German Baltic island of Ruegen . German ace Hans-Ulrich Rudel claimed to have destroyed more than 500 tanks, mostly on the Eastern Front, and several ships including a Soviet battleship, primarily in the Stuka. The Stuka was used throughout the Second World War, but for all its successes in the early days on the Western Front and in the later invasion of the Soviet Union, the aircraft was later outclassed by quicker and more maneuverable Allied fighter planes. As museum pieces today, they're a big draw for visitors and also important for researchers and historians, said Kathleen McCarthy, director of collections at Chicago's Museum of Science and Industry. The museum's Stuka had been shot down over Libya in the last year of the War. 'The discovery and raising of a third Stuka from the sea floor will be a great asset for both scholars and the general public interested in learning more about historic military technology as well as this critical period in our world history,' she said.","Salvage team now hopes to completely restore the plane .

A former U.S. Secret Service agent has launched a stinging attack on the Clinton administration staff he used to protect - branding them arrogant and claiming that ex-First Lady Hillary Clinton was aloof. Breaking from tradition, Dan Emmett has laid bare a series of anecdotes about the inner workings of the White House in a controversial book. He tells how Mrs Clinton, now Secretary of State, never said 'thank you' to agents, unlike her husband, Bill, and their daughter, Chelsea. Aloof: Hillary Clinton (pictured in 2008) would never say 'thank you' to the Secret Service agents who protected her during her husband's presidency, according to a former member of the protection unit . Ungrateful: Her demeanor was colder than that of Mr Clinton and their daughter Chelsea (centre) This trait, he added, was found in . even greater measure among the young White House personnel, whom he said . displayed 'fundamental traits of rudeness and arrogance' which, at . times, bordered on dangerous. 'Most . of these youngsters were from wealthy families and many viewed Secret . Service agents as the hired help,' he wrote in the autobiography Within . Arm's Length. One unnamed Clinton employee treated a Russian KGB agent on one . presidential visit 'as if he were dealing with a Wackenhut security . officer in Toledo.' He also . accuses Mr Clinton of putting his own life and those of his agents at risk by insisting on a 'totally pointless photo op' on the North . Korea-South Korea border.

During the trip in 1993, he said the . former President went too far along the bridge separating the two . nations, according to the Washington Examiner. 'No-one seemed to know if President Clinton grasped how potentially dangerous this stop on the bridge was,' he writes. 'The Secret Service obviously believed this move unwise' He added: 'Nevertheless, he was POTUS and he wanted to stand on the bridge, so stand on the bridge he would do.' In another account, Emmett said Mr Clinton 'dealt us this nightmare' by insisting on jogging in public. Agents tried to change his mind and even went as far as building a quarter-mile track inside the White House confines. But . Mr Clinton was unpersuaded and asked the presidential protective division . to come up some routes outside the grounds, it was reported on Chicago . Tribune News.

In the the dead of night, the Halifax bomber crew were heading for home after a successful mission over Germany. Suddenly the plane burst into flames as it came under enemy fire and the crew were forced to bail out, parachuting into a field, only to be captured by the German soldiers waiting below. The Canadian pilot, Jim Watson, and his British wireless operator, Richard Yates, spent the final three years of the Second World War as prisoners. The veterans remained friends over the years and should have been able to stand side by side once again at the unveiling of a £6.5 million Bomber Command Memorial in London on June 28. Attending: Canadian pilot Jim Watson (left) has been invited to the memorial, while Briton Richard Yates (right) is set to miss out . Although Mr Watson, 91, is being flown over for the event by the Canadian government, his old comrade, who lives just outside the capital in Surrey, has been unable to get a ticket and cannot attend. Mr Yates, 90, is one of a growing number of Bomber Command veterans who are angry about missing out on the grand unveiling ceremony in Green Park because no more tickets are available. On Monday the Daily Mail revealed how 91-year-old Freddie Johnson, who flew 92 missions as a rear gunner, had been told there were no tickets available for him to attend the ceremony. Then yesterday the family of former navigator Tom Bennett, 93, a decorated member of the Dambusters squadron, said they have been trying for months to get a ticket for him but have had no response to emails and a letter. On the plane: Mr Watson, pictured during the war and more recently, is among 25 Canadian veterans who will be flying over for the memorial . Richard Yates, pictured last year (left) and in his flight suit in 1941 (right) flew 15 missions before being shot down over Belgium in 1942 . Despite helping to raise funds for the memorial and being a member of the Bomber Command Association, Mr Yates said he didn’t know about the ceremony or the need to apply for tickets until it was too late. By contrast Mr Watson, a retired chemical engineer, and 24 other Canadian veterans (each accompanied by a carer) are having their return transatlantic flights and their accommodation paid for by their government and arrangements have been made for them to attend the ceremony during the four-day trip. ‘The last time they paid for me to fly across the Atlantic to England I got into a bit of a mess and that was 1941,’ said Mr Watson from his home in Quebec. ‘It’s wonderful what the Canadian government is doing and I was very surprised when Dickie told me he couldn’t go. I thought he would have known all about it.’ The two men plan to meet anyway, but Mr Yates’s family feel the efforts made to fly veterans from across the world to the ceremony is ‘rubbing salt into the wounds’ of the British servicemen who are missing out. His son Roland Yates, 61, a building surveyor, said: ‘I think the Government over here should have helped out to make sure all the veterans who fought in Bomber Command could go. Grand opening:The Queen is expected to unveil the £6.5m Bomber Command memorial in central London later this month . 'My father had no idea this was happening or how the tickets were being allocated until we read about it in the Daily Mail. ‘We feel he has been let down. He is very proud of his war years and we feel sorry for him.’ Mr Yates was based at Linton-on-Ouse, North Yorkshire, during the war and flew 15 missions before being shot down over Belgium on June 9,1942. The entire seven-man crew safely parachuted to the ground but were quickly rounded up by German soldiers. He served out the war in several POW camps before being liberated by Allied forces while he and his fellow prisoners were on a forced march. Mr Yates, who was promoted to warrant officer while in captivity, married in 1945, became a father of two and worked as a tax officer. He is now a great-grandfather living in a retirement home in Farnham, Surrey. When his wife Rita died in 2000, his former pilot, Mr Watson, invited him to Canada to visit and come to terms with his loss. Mr Yates said he received information . in the post about the memorial fundraising last year but was not aware . veterans had to apply for tickets. He said: ‘I would have liked to have . received an invitation to the unveiling ceremony, but it’s not to be.’ The memorial in Green Park will honour the 55,573 bomber crew who lost their lives . Within hours of the Daily Mail article about Mr Johnson, from Tadcaster, . North Yorkshire, his family received a call from Royal Air Force . organisers to tell them that two tickets would be provided after all. However, Mr Bennett, who survived dozens of dangerous missions, has not so far received an offer of tickets. Mr . Bennett, of Chiselhurst, Kent, joined 49 Squadron at the outbreak of . war and was a navigator on Lancaster bombers before transferring to the . 617 Dambusters Squadron after the raid on the German dams. The . Queen is expected to unveil the £6.5million memorial to the 55,573 . bomber crew who lost their lives and 6,500 people have been allocated . tickets. Other members of the Royal Family will attend. A spokesman for the RAF said the . Ministry of Defence has had no involvement in the arrangements for the . unveiling, apart from supporting the event and being available for . ‘advice’. He denied the MoD could have made a difference. ‘The . Bomber Command team have done a fantastic job,’ he said. ‘They have put . out a lot of information to inform people what was going on. Unfortunately not everybody reads newspapers and some have found out . very late indeed.’ There will be around 100 dignitaries at the event, but the RAF spokesman said the Defence Secretary would be the only minister there to ensure as many veterans as possible could attend. ● A massive memorial commemorating the deaths of all 1.7million servicemen and women who died in the First and Second World Wars is planned to open on the 100th anniversary of the start of the Great War in August 2014.

Budget retailer Poundland has been forced to review its dress code after a row erupted on Twitter and Facebook following claims that it had banned staff from wearing remembrance poppies. In a statement on Facebook, Poundland said it was not against employees wearing a poppy, but they were not allowed to do so on the shop floor because it is not part of staff uniform. But the company said today that it will now allow workers to 'use their own discretion in wearing poppies' after hundreds of customers threatened to boycott its stores. The claims that Poundland had banned staff from wearing them sparked the row on Twitter and the store's Facebook page, with hundreds of people expressing outrage at the policy . It had been claimed on Facebook that one member of staff was sent home from work and faced losing her job after refusing to remove her poppy. But in a statement Poundland said: 'On Friday 28th October a situation in Northern Ireland was brought to the company's attention where a store colleague was politely asked to remove a poppy by our store manager in order to comply with company policy. 'The store colleague decided to walk out and stated that she would return on Monday next wearing her poppy.'

The red poppy has become a familiar emblem of Remembrance Day and is worn as a mark of respect to servicemen and women who have been killed or injured fighting for their country. Poppy pride: David Dimbleby displays his one at Question Time . The claims that Poundland had banned staff from wearing them sparked the row on Twitter and the store's Facebook page, with hundreds of people expressing outrage at the policy. Comments included 'disgusting' and 'shameful', and some customers said they would no longer shop at the store, describing it as a 'disgrace'. One Poundland employee, Vicky Hill, left the message: 'I don't think this is right. It's a sign of respect. Everyone has the right to wear a poppy. 'Of course, I shan't be wearing my poppy at work simply because rules are rules, and at the end of the day I abide by them. But I am not pleased with this at all.' Shane Brown said: 'I'm a Poundland employee and I find this a disgrace tbh we should be allowed to wear them with pride and respect at ALL times!!!' Poundland customer Linda Williams wrote: 'So wrong of you! Have some respect for those who fought and died for this country.' Poundland responded on the website yesterday saying it listens to its customers and was giving their views 'serious consideration'. Today, chief executive Jim McCarthy said: ""We have listened to the views of customers and colleagues and have, in light of their feedback, reviewed the policy. ""We have decided in the case of the poppy appeal to allow store colleagues to use their own discretion in wearing poppies. ""This change in policy is consistent with recent reviews of policy made by other leading High street retailers. ""We apologise for any unintended offence that has been caused."" The 2011 Poppy Appeal was launched on Thursday and is the culmination of the Royal British Legion's 90th anniversary year. Television presenter David Dimbleby ignored BBC guidelines and wore his poppy on Thursday night's edition of Question Time - 36 hours before the go-ahead from BBC bosses. David Jordan, director of editorial policy and standards, ordered that poppies should be worn on screen from 6am today until '23.59pm on Sunday November 13 — Remembrance Sunday.'

We live in a country four times wealthier than it was when the Queen came to the throne, according to an official count produced for the Jubilee today. But we are more likely to make our money out of shops than the metal-bashing and manufacturing that dominated our commercial life 60 years ago. We have nearly four times as many divorces, about a third fewer marriages, and a country where people are likely to be much older than in the 1950s. The breakdown of the differences between Britain in 1952 and Britain now was produced by the Office for National Statistics and other Whitehall departments to mark the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee celebrations, which reach their climax next weekend. Experience: The Queen has seen her country change so dramatically since her Coronation ceremony in 1953 . It showed that when the Queen came to the throne the wealth of the nation was, in raw figures, about 100 times less than it is now. Gross domestic product totalled £15,983 million, against £1,507,585 million in 2011. However inflation has taken a very large bite out of the value of the pound over 60 years. A 1952 pound is worth £24.34 today – so that the national wealth is really only slightly under four times greater now than then. There are nearly 600,000 men now working as shop managers or assistants or in sales, the figures showed. Retail jobs did not figure among the top five occupations for men 60 years ago. Instead, there were more than 400,000 men in metalworking, engineering and electrical trades, and nearly 400,000 more classed as unskilled industrial labourers. Different industries: Sixty years ago there were more than 400,000 men in the metalworking industry whereas now more men work in retail . Non-committal: We have nearly four times as many divorces, about a third fewer marriages than in 1952, according to the Office of National Statistics . In 1952 there were more than 370,000 women working as domestic servants and 215,000 classed as charwomen or office cleaners. Today, there are more women working as domestic cleaners – 384,000 – and a further 446,000 in the booming care industry, working either as care home assistants or home carers. A second report, from the Department for Work and Pensions, reveals the scale of the extraordinary social change in Britain as people are living longer than ever before. In 1952, there were just 300 centenarians in England and Wales. Today there are around 13,420 people alive today who have celebrated their 100th birthday. Women's work: In 1952 there were more than 370,000 women working as domestic servants but today 446,000 work in the care industry . Inflation: A 1952 pound is worth £24.34 today so that the national wealth is really only slightly under four times greater now than then . Over the last 60 years, the department estimates the Queen has sent around 110,000 telegrams and messages to people who have reached the landmark birthday. But she will be writing to record numbers each year as the number of people who are expected to survive until 100 is set to balloon. A baby boy born in 1952 was expected to live to the age of 78. A baby boy born today is expected to live to 91, with around 32 per cent reaching 100. Meanwhile, a baby girl is living for 11 years longer than in 1952, with life expectancy at birth rising from 83 to 94. Gross Domestic Product (GDP) £15.9 million . Life expectancy (boy) 78 . Life expectancy (girl) 83 . People aged 100 and over 300 . % of pensioners in population 14 . Employment (men) 400,000 in metalworking, engineering and electrical trades . Employment (women) 370,000 domestic servants and 215,000 charwomen or office cleaners . GDP £1.5 billion . Life expectancy (boy) 91 . Life expectancy (girl) 94 . People aged 100 and over 13420 . % of pensioners in population 20 . Employment (men) 600,000 as shop managers or assistants or in sales . Employment (women) 384,000 domestic cleaners and 446,000 care home assistants or home carers . Soaring life expectancy means pensioners make up one in five of the population, compared to only one in seven – or 14 per cent – in 1952. Experts warn children may live to 100, but they will not get their State pension until they are ‘70 or beyond’. The State pension age is already rising to 66 for both men and women by 2020, rising again to 67 in 2028 and will continue to rise as life expectancy increases.","We now have four times as many divorces and about a third fewer marriages than in 1952 .

Only 15 of the hundreds of foreigners who took part in the riots of 2011 have been deported, the Mail can reveal. Ministers had promised to get tough after violence and mayhem tore apart English cities, but the vast majority of overseas nationals who joined in the destruction are still here. A combination of EU law and human rights rules is thought to be blocking efforts to deport them and could lead to large numbers being granted the right to stay. Carnage: Although more than 200 foreigners were convicted of taking part in the 2011 riots in London, only 15 have been deported . Mayhem: Rioters throw missiles at lines of riot police in London in August 2011 . While officials have managed to kick out 15 of the rioters, another 31 have been told they can remain in the country despite their crimes. More than 200 foreign criminals were convicted for their part in the riots in which shops were plundered, businesses set ablaze and hundreds of millions of pounds of damage done. Among the offences they carried out were burglary, robbery, theft, criminal damage and disorder. If the remaining cases follow the same pattern – of one rioter kicked out for every two who remain – it would mean more than 130 ending up staying in Britain. Many remain behind bars at a cost to tax-payers of tens of thousands of pounds a week – but more than 80 are at large having been released. And three convicted foreign rioters have been ‘lost’ by the UK Border Agency after failing to comply with bail conditions. Ministers had pledged to take tough action to kick out foreign criminals as quickly as possible after the riots in August 2011 which began in Tottenham, north London and spread across the country into several nights of carnage. Home Office minister Damian Green said at the time: ‘We strongly believe that foreign national lawbreakers should be removed from the UK at the earliest opportunity. Thugs: People try to kick in the window of a jeweller's shop near the Bullring shopping centre in Birmingham, central England, as violence spread outside London . Violent: Among the offences carried out by foreigners in the riots were burglary, robbery, theft and criminal damage . London's burning: Shops and residential properties on fire in Croydon during rioting in the summer of 2011 . ‘We also have the power to cancel visas of foreign nationals found guilty of criminal activity, and this is something we will be looking to do when these cases arise.’ In the following months, it emerged that non-UK nationals played a central role in the mayhem. Figures from the courts showed one in seven of all convicted rioters was from overseas. The Ministry of Justice released a list showing 44 nationalities of convicted rioters, including those from Afghanistan, Cuba, Ethiopia and Samoa. The largest group was Jamaicans, followed by Somali and Polish offenders. Other rioters came from Colombia, Iraq, the Congo, Vietnam and Zimbabwe. The true number of foreign nationals may be even higher as 4 per cent of those taken into remand during the riots refused to tell police their nationality. The UKBA has set up a special unit, known as Operation Lancaster, to track down and remove foreigners involved in ‘serious criminality’. Mob mentality: Masked rioters taunt police in Tottenham in August 2011 . Chaos: Riot police form a line as they attempt to stop rioters in Tottenham during the summer of 2011 . But figures released after a request under the Freedom of Information Act show their record to date is lamentably poor. Of the 201 cases passed to UKBA, only 15 have been kicked out. Some 28 have been given permission to stay because they ‘do not meet deportation criteria’. Three others have been allowed to remain after legal appeals. A total of 63 are still in prison, or in immigration detention awaiting deportation. Pledge: Home Office minister Damian Green said at the time that the Government strongly believed that foreign offenders should be deported . The fact that they are still behind bars suggests officials are more confident of eventually removing them. Another 53 are at large but classed as ‘still being considered for deportation’. There are 31 who have been given temporary admission while their cases are considered. The three who have absconded have not been named and officials refused to reveal any further details. Five others are still waiting to be sentenced. EU rules prevent officials even trying to deport any European nationals sentenced to less than two years in prison. Non-EU nationals do not qualify for automatic deportation unless they were jailed for at least 12 months. Peter Cuthbertson, director of the think-tank the Centre for Crime Prevention, said: ‘The average rioter in 2011 had already committed 15 offences, so the public have a right to expect them to be punished properly. They will be appalled by these figures, which show just how important it is to fix our human rights laws.’ Last night, immigration minister Mark Harper said: ‘Many of those convicted of involvement in last summer’s riots are still behind bars – that’s where they belong. ‘We are pursuing deportation in scores of cases and wherever possible, when they have paid their debt to society, we will remove them from the UK.’ A gang that made millions of pounds smuggling immigrants in at a rate of ten a day has been broken up. Thousands of migrants from Iraq, Afghanistan and Iran paid the people traffickers up to £13,500 each for passage into the UK. Some 3,800 migrants were smuggled into Britain over 12 months, hidden in lorries on cross-Channel ferries. It is estimated that the gang may have made more than £50million. Details of the vast profits emerged after the conspiracy was smashed last week by police and immigration officials on both sides of the Channel. Hidden: Stowaway migrants found in a truck in Dunkirk last week . Officials in the UK Border Agency made 20 arrests across the country last Wednesday in one of the biggest ever operations to target people-smuggling gangs. Two hundred officers raided 35 addresses, including locations in London, Birmingham, Manchester and Coventry. Forty other raids took place in France and Belgium. French officials said that they had dealt a ‘body blow’ to illegal immigration by smashing the ‘vast network’. Officers were deployed on France’s border with Belgium and at migrant camps near Dunkirk to identify the smugglers. Ten individuals were arrested in Belgium, including two suspected ringleaders. French police said migrants would be put into lorries parked on motorways in Belgium, to board cross-Channel ferries at Calais and Dunkirk. Earlier this month, four children were discovered who were suffering from hypothermia having been stowed away in a refrigerated lorry. Aged betwewen nine and 16, they were found huddled together in sub-zero temperatures in a trailer full of soft cheese in Dunkirk. The Slovak vehicle, which was stopped before it boarded a Dover ferry, was heading for Milton Keynes – another seven hours away. UKBA estimated the fee at £2,000 to £6,000. However, French police said that the price per person as high as 16,000 euros – some £13,500. The migrants smuggled by the gang were Kurds, an ethnic group found in several states in Asia. Chris Foster, from UKBA’s criminal and financial investigation team said: ‘We believe we have successfully disrupted a significant organised network.’","Ministers had promised to get tough after violence tore cities apart .

"By . James White . UPDATED: . 06:48 EST, 13 February 2012 . The U.S. Ambassador to Syria has blamed the country's government for attacks on civilians and has taken the unusual step of posting a military aerial photograph on Facebook to back his claims. Robert Ford spoke angrily about the killings of unarmed civilians in Syria's third-largest city of Homs after uploading the detailed aerial image showing army vehicles in residential neighbourhoods. Speaking from Paris after he closed the U.S. Embassy in Damascus earlier this week, he called on the country's Government to end the bombardment of civilians. The U.S. State Department also piled on the pressure by releasing further images showing the Syrian regime's artillery deployed around the country. More than 300 civilians have died in Homs in the past week alone. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . U.S. Ambassador to Syria Robert Ford posted this de-classified U.S. military image of Homs apparently showing the attacks on civilians . Military operation: Another map published on the U.S. Embassy in Damascus's website, showing artillery positions in Syria . He said: 'I've spent a good part of the day . looking at what's happening in Syria and the shelling again by Syrian . forces on residential areas of Syria's third-largest city of Homs is . absolutely awful, it's horrific. 'We want that government violence to stop before Syria goes off a cliff,' he told NBC. Speaking about his Facebook posts, he said: 'The Syrian government's claims that terrorists are shelling parts of Homs are completely ridiculous. We know who is shelling Homs. 'We know that and I do not want the Syrian government selling a propaganda scheme to try to hide the truth.' On the attack: This image - thought to be taken by a drone aircraft shows three Syrian military tanks near the Al Baath University housing complex in Homs . First, like people around the world, my . colleagues and friends are watching the video coming out of Homs and . some of the other Syrian cities in the last days with horror and . revulsion. I hear the devastating stories about newborns in Homs dying . in hospitals where electricity has been cut and when we see disturbing . photos offering proof that the regime is using mortars and artillery . against residential neighborhoods, all of us become even more concerned . about the tragic outcome for Syrian civilians. The Arab League protocol, . which received wide support from the international community, called . for the Syrian military to withdraw from residential areas, to stop . firing at peaceful protests and to release prisoners arrested due to the . unrest. The film coming out of Homs and elsewhere in Syria shows the . Syrian government's real response. And we have never heard of the armed . opposition firing artillery for example. It is odd to me that anyone . would try to equate the actions of the Syrian army and armed opposition . groups since the Syrian government consistently initiates the attacks on . civilian areas, and it is using its heaviest weapons. 'I hope they [the people of Syria] do not feel abandoned because the international community is coming together more and more. 'The government of Syria needs to respect basic human rights and it needs to allow a peaceful political transition to go forward.' On the decision to close the embassy on February 6, he said: 'Very frankly, it was very hard to take . down the American flag for the last time from the American Embassy, it . is a symbol of our presence, it is a symbol of our engagement in a . country like Syria.' Gunmen assassinated an army general in Damascus today in the first killing of a high ranking military officer in the Syrian capital since the uprising against President Bashar Assad's regime began in March. Three gunmen were reported to have opened fire at Brig. Gen. Issa al-Khouli in the morning as he left his home in the Damascus neighborhood of Rukn-Eddine. Al-Khouli was a doctor and the chief of a military hospital in the capital. No one claimed responsibility for the killing. The attack indicates that violence in Syria is reaching the tightly controlled capital, which has been relatively quiet compared to other cities. Such assassinations are not uncommon outside Damascus and army officers have been killed in the past, mostly in the restive provinces of Homs and Idlib. This morning activists claimed President  Assad's forces killed at least four civilians in an intensified tank and rocket bombardment on opposition districts in Homs. 'This is the most violent barrage since the attack on Homs started six days ago. The four included a 55-year old woman. 'They were killed by shelling that hit a building where they live in Bab Amro,' opposition activist Mohammad Hassan said. Footage posted online showed a doctor at a field hospital in Bab Amro next to the body of the woman, who appeared to have been hit in the head. 'This is Ibtissam al-Dalati, mother of three...Shrapnel hit her in the head,' the doctor says, holding the woman's fractured and bloody head. 'I call upon all Syrians to take to the streets to take the pressure off Homs.' Pressure: The U.S. State Department has issued satellite pictures, showing Syrian artillery strategically deployed towards the city of Homes . Imagery: The images are thought to have been taken by an unmanned aircraft. This shows military hardware near Rankus last week . Western diplomat have warned Syrian officials involved in the brutal suppression of the anti-regime protests will eventually be held accountable for their actions. Efforts are under way in Western capitals to assemble evidence of human rights abuses by members of president Bashar al Assad's regime with a view to use in future proceedings. Referral to the International Criminal Court would require the authorisation of the United Nations Security Council - currently seen as unlikely given the opposition of Russia and China. However Western officials insist that eventually those Syrians responsible for atrocities against the civilian population could still be brought to book. Launch: This image released by the U.S. State Dept shows a rocket launcher near to the besieged city of Homs . Weaponry: Intelligence analysts said the images show heavy weaponry being deployed for use against civilians in or near the Syrian cities of Az Zabadani, Halbun, Rankus and Homs . Steps are already under way within . the European Union to impose travel bans and asset freezes on named . Syrian officials - a move which could translate into further action at a . later date. 'It is . important that Syrian senior regime officials understand that even if . they are out of reach today there may come a point down the line when . they will be held accountable,' said one Western diplomat. 'A . lot of these mid-ranking officials, they don't have significant assets . and within the EU jurisdiction they are probably not going to travel . much. Shelling: In this online video, tanks fire in the Baba Amro neighbourhood in the flashpoint city of Homs . Anger: Robert Ford called on Syria to stop the killing of civilians . 'But mainly it shows that a list of names that at the moment is a list of people who are not allowed to travel to the EU can very easily become another kind of list of names in another form further down the line.' Officials admit they see little hope of breaking the current cycle of violence, with the regime now apparently firmly locked in to a 'security solution'. 'With the amount of blood that has been spilt the regime is now committed to this process, it can't back up. There is too much blood spilt. It is a cul-de-sac,' said one diplomat. 'They will either succeed by force of arms or they will lose.' Bloodshed: More than 300 people including this man have died in Homs in the past week . Despite the frustration, there was caution about calls from some in the Syrian opposition for the international community to establish safe havens or humanitarian corridors through which aid can pass. Officials warned of the dangers of sending in aid workers without adequate protection. 'It is important not to engage in wishful thinking about what you can do if you are not going to do the whole thing, otherwise you end up in mid-1990s and Bosnia,' said one diplomat. Meanwhile, 28 people have been killed and 235 wounded in Aleppo, Syria's largest city, according to the country's Health Ministry. Syrian media reported that the fatalities were caused by two explosions near security compounds in the northern city yesterday. State television blamed 'terrorists' for the blasts, following the regime line that armed groups looking to destabilise Syria are behind the uprising. But opposition activists accused Mr Assad's regime of setting off the blasts. More than 5,400 people have been killed since the uprising began in March last year. Foreign Secretary William Hague has said that Britain has no plans to arm Syrian rebels trying to overthrow the president. David Cameron has pledged to maintain the pressure on Mr Assad and his government, saying he was determined to see the 'toughest possible response' to the brutality. UN chief Ban Ki-moon has condemned the 'appalling brutality' of the onslaught.

Critical condition: Aimee Copeland is battling for life in intensive care after contracting a flesh-eating bug that forced doctors to amputate her leg . Just over a week ago, 24-year-old Aimee Copeland was kayaking down a creek in Carrollton, Georgia when she stopped to ride a home-made zipline. The line snapped, and she suffered a gash to her left calf. Now Miss Copeland is fighting for her life in hospital, after horrified doctors realised an aggressive flesh-eating bacteria had invaded the wound. Medics were forced to amputate the young woman's leg on Friday night, and she remains in a critical condition at the JMS Burn Center in Augusta. Doctors have put her chances of survival as 'slim to none,' according to a message her devastated father posted on Facebook. Andy Copeland told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution that his daughter, who is a graduate psychology student at the University of West Georgia, attended the emergency room at Tanner Medical Center in Carrollton after cutting her leg. Doctors there closed the wound with 22 staples, and told her to take Motrin and Tylenol for the pain. The next day, she returned complaining of severe pain and was given a prescription for painkillers. Her father said this alleviated her symptoms, but the pain continued to build on Thursday. 'Aimee went to the doctor and received a prescription for antibiotics and posted a clean MRI report,' he said. 'Again, she was treated and released.' On Friday morning the student was driven to the emergency room by a concerned friend. Pale and weak, she received a shocking diagnosis: She was suffering from necrotizing fasciitis, a rare flesh-eating bacteria that can destroy skin, fat and muscle. Physicians told the young woman the infection had already spread to her thigh and hip, and that her whole leg would have to be amputated. Miss Copeland was flown to the Joseph M. Still Burn Center in Augusta, where doctors performed a high-hip amputation of her left leg and removed further infected tissue from her abdomen. 'The surgeons advised me that they wanted to try to save her leg, but at this point saving her life took precedence,' Mr Copeland said on Facebook. 'They removed all of the infected tissue and advised that she would have limited, if any use of her leg.' 'Aimee [cardiac] arrested when they moved her from the operating table, but they were able to successfully resuscitate her,' he added. Much-loved: Aimee's friends and family are praying for her survival and eventual recovery . Though she initially made progress, her father believes Miss Copeland may be deteriorating. Yesterday, her organs were said to be shutting down and her temperature was 102. Mr Copeland is hoping and praying that his daughter will survive her appalling ordeal. He described her as 'a lover of people,' who had majored in psychology because she wanted to help people through their own traumas. Writing on Facebook on 6 May, he concluded: 'I type this factual progression of Aimee’s condition as a way to better cope with what is without a doubt the most horrific situation that a parent can possibly imagine. 'We take so much for granted in life, but I never imagined that one of my daughters would face this most unlikely of situations. 'I hope and pray that when you read this that the news we receive at sunrise will be positive. At this point, no news is good news, but all I know to do is hope and pray for the best. I only ask that you all do the same.' The JMS Burn Center in Augusta, where Aimee is receiving vital medical care . Friends and co-workers from the Sunnyside Cafe in Carrollton, where Miss Copeland works, have banded together to support her family. WSBTV quoted a friend, Kara Dermo, who said, 'She was awesome, just great ... just really awesome to be around.' Miss Copeland is well-known in Carrollton, where she had organised festivals and activities. Sunnyside cafe owner Gary Duke said: 'She planned to go to work helping troubled youth. Then all the sudden, this devastating accident.' A website for psychology students at the University of West Virginia said of the brave young woman: . 'About Aimee: Bright star, lover of life, infinitely generous of heart and spirit. From Snellville, GA. B.A. from UGA in 2010. Nearing completion of her Master’s degree at UWG Psychology. Loved dearly by family and friends.' Miss Copeland's friends have established Aimee's Fund at the United Community Bank in Carrollton, with the aim of raising money for her rehabilitation. Details are available on the student page dedicated to Miss Copeland. They also plan to hold a blood drive in the university's gym from 2 to 7pm on May 15. Necrotizing fasciitis, more commonly known as 'flesh-eating disease', is a rare but extremely vicious bacterial infection. 'Necrotizing' refers to something that causes body tissue to die, and the infection can destroy skin, muscles and fat. The disease develops when the bacteria enters the body, often through a minor cut or scrape. As the bacteria multiply, they release toxins that kill tissue and cut off blood flow to the area. Because it is so virulent, the bacteria spreads rapidly throughout the body. Symptoms include small, red lumps or bumps on the skin, rapidly-spreading bruising, sweating, chills, fever and nausea. Organ failure and shock are also common complications. Sufferers must be treated immediately to prevent death, and are usually given powerful antibiotics and surgery to remove dead tissue. Amputation can become necessary if the disease spreads through an arm or leg. Patients may undergo skin grafts after the infection has cleared up, to help the healing process or for aesthetic reasons.","Aimee Copeland was infected with killer bug through a cut on her leg .

DIY abortion: Sarah Catt pleaded guilty to administering poison with intent to procure a miscarriage of her unborn baby, within a week of the due date . A woman is facing jail for aborting her baby herself in the final week of pregnancy. Sarah Catt, 35, bought a drug over the internet and appeared in court yesterday charged with taking it with ‘intent to procure a miscarriage’. She has pleaded guilty to the charge but refused to co-operate with police and detectives do not know what happened to the baby’s body. Further details of the ‘highly unusual’ case will be revealed when the defendant returns to Leeds Crown Court to be sentenced in September. Catt has two children, aged 10 and eight, and is still with her husband Stephen, 41, who accompanied her to court yesterday. The couple have kept the case secret from close relatives and Catt’s father-in-law last night said news of the court appearance was a ‘complete shock’. He described Catt as a ‘lovely woman’ and said the offence was ‘totally out of character’. Police revealed Catt had a scan at two days short of 30 weeks in March 2010, which confirmed she was pregnant. It is not clear whether she had known she was pregnant before the scan. However, the baby was terminated ‘in the final stages of pregnancy’. Chief Inspector Kerrin Smith, of North Yorkshire Police, said outside court ‘many questions remain unanswered’ despite a long police investigation. Police found evidence Catt bought a drug via the internet which is commonly used to induce abortions. Inspector Smith said the medication ‘could facilitate the labour and delivery of a child’. She said: ‘The evidence shows this to have happened in the final stages of pregnancy within the last week of the due date that this baby should have been born. ‘Throughout this investigation [Catt] has claimed that this pregnancy was terminated legitimately even though that would not be legally possible. ‘A legal termination can only be carried out up to 24 weeks in normal circumstances unless there are dire medical requirements to go beyond this. There were none in this case.’ Catt pleaded guilty to a charge under Section 58 of the 1861 Offences Against the Person Act, which in theory  carries a maximum life imprisonment sentence. Her charge stated that ‘between March and June 2010, being a woman with child, you unlawfully administered to yourself a poison or other noxious thing with intent to procure your own miscarriage’. Almost 30 weeks: Catt had a scan at two days short of 30 weeks confirming she was pregnant (model used in photo) It is legal to have an abortion in the UK during the first 24 weeks of pregnancy so long as certain criteria are met. The abortion must be performed in a hospital or specialised licensed clinic. Two doctors must also agree that it would cause less damage to the woman's physical or mental health than continuing with the pregnancy. It can only be performed after 24 weeks if the woman's life is at risk, or there is a substantial risk the child would suffer serious physical or mental handicap. Chief Inspector Smith said, despite the guilty plea, Catt had refused to tell police what happened. ‘To date no remains of that pregnancy, nor body, nor child has been traced,’ she said. Mr Justice Maddison adjourned sentencing for a psychiatric report to be carried out, commenting: ‘There are highly unusual circumstances here.’ The defendant was released on bail. Catt, who works in a solicitor’s office, lives in a £200,000 house in Sherburn in Elmet, North Yorkshire, with her family. She and her husband, who works for a street lighting firm, have refused to comment. The couple met at a pub where Catt worked as a barmaid and married in a ceremony on the Caribbean island of Antigua in 2009. Roger Catt, 67, her father-in-law, said: ‘It’s totally out of character. She’s a lovely woman. I would never imagine her to do anything like this. ‘She has two lovely children she adores. She would not want to put that in jeopardy or Stephen. She has always been a doting mum. It is a complete shock to us.’ He added: ‘We are not aware of any problems in the marriage. We had no idea about what has happened and did not know there was a court case. ‘As far as we were aware everything was hunky dory and still is.’","Sarah Catt, 35, aborted her unborn baby 'in the final stages of pregnancy'

An Iranian scientist claims he has invented a time machine that allows you to predict the future with 98 per cent accuracy. Ali Razeghi says his device can produce a print-out detailing any individual's life between five and eight years in advance after taking readings from the touch of a user. He claims the Iranian government, whose nuclear programme has caused concern around the world, can use his invention to predict military conflicts and forecast the fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies and oil. Not quite the DeLorean yet: An Iranian scientist has claimed to have invented a time machine, but unlike the car (above) in Back To The Future it produces a print-out detailing a person's life ahead rather than actually taking them anywhere . He says the device is the size of a laptop and uses a complex set of algorithms which took him ten years to develop, but has not revealed any concrete details about his invention. Unlike the time-travelling DeLorean in hit film Back To The Future, Mr Razeghi said his device 'will not take you into the future, it will bring the future to you.' He told the Fars state news agency: 'My invention easily fits into the size of a personal computer case and can predict details of the next five to eight years of the life of its users. 'Naturally a government that can see five years into the future would be able to prepare itself for challenges that might destabilise it. Fates of the state: Inventor Ali Razeghi claims his device can be used by warmongering Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad (above) to predict military conflicts and future values of currencies and oil . 'As such, we expect to market this invention among states as well as individuals once we reach a mass production stage.' Mr . Razeghi, who claims he has 179 inventions listed under his name, has . been criticised by friends and family for 'trying to play God.' But he said: 'This project is not against our religious values at all. 'The Americans are trying to make this invention by spending millions of dollars on it where I have already achieved it by a fraction of the cost,' he said, without divulging how much. He said Iran was not planning to launch the prototype just yet in case 'the Chinese will steal the idea and produce it in millions overnight'. Doctored? Iran faced accusations that its much-heralded new fighter jet could even fly and that this picture of it soaring over mountains had been superimposed in Photoshop . Iran has been ridiculed in recent months after attempting to showcase its technological advances only to face accusations they were faked. In February, it proudly unveiled a stealth fighter jet at a ceremony attended by President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, but experts quickly expressed serious doubts about whether it could even fly. A picture of the domestically produced Qaher-313 apparently soaring over Iranian mountains did little to curb scepticism amid claims the plane never actually left the ground, but was simply doctored using Photoshop. Critics also believe Iran's claims that it launched a monkey into space could have been faked. Scientists in Tehran hailed the mission to send a simian 75 miles above Earth and back in a Kavoshgar rocket as a success. But question marks were raised after the monkey presented to the nation as the heroic astronaut looked remarkably different than the one which made lift off.","Ali Razeghi, 27, claims device can detail person's life with 98% accuracy .

When Kate Harrison’s seven-year-old daughter sobbed herself to sleep every night for three months, it was clear something had to change. Ever since she’d started school, Bella had struggled with playground politics. Issues that another child might shrug off, such as a bit of teasing or being excluded from a game, hit the sensitive little girl very hard. Her mother tried every strategy to boost Bella’s confidence, but the situation just got worse. ‘We got to the point where every night after school she was distraught. Eventually, I was crying myself to sleep at night, too,’ says Kate, 41. Desperate for a solution, Kate, scanned online parenting forums for advice. It was there she learned about life coaches for children. Life coaches used to be viewed as rather ‘new age’ — counsellors hired by self-indulgent adults who felt they’d lost their way in their personal lives or careers and needed to ‘empower’ themselves. But life coaching for children has become increasingly popular, with coaches tackling issues from bullying and low self-confidence to handling exam pressure and family difficulties. Some will view this growing band as doing little more than pandering to the whims of neurotic parents, or those mums and dads who have big incomes but are time-poor, and so have had to outsource their own nurturing role. At £60 to £250 per session, life coaching for children doesn’t come cheap. But Kate, who has a part-time personnel job, says she doesn’t know how her family would have coped without Naomi Richards — who claims to be the only life coach in Britain to work with children as young as six. Kate insists that hiring a life coach was the best decision she could have made, and that the change in her daughter, now eight, has been dramatic. ‘Life coaching was totally new to me but we’d got to the point where we needed outside help,’ says Kate, from Hertfordshire. ‘Bella would come home from school and worry incessantly over what had happened in the playground. The issues she faced weren’t anything you don’t find in playgrounds across the country, but in her mind they were insurmountable.' Kate is married to Paul, a senior product manager for a mobile phone company, and the couple also have a four-year-old son, Oliver. ‘Bella’s unhappiness began to dominate family life,’ Kate adds. ‘When, one night, she told me she wanted to “dead myself” — words can’t describe how distressing that was.’ In the end, two 45-minute sessions with Naomi were all Bella needed. ‘Together they worked out a plan of different ways to handle situations that upset Bella,’ explains Kate. ‘She could try out the strategies — whether it was to play elsewhere, tell a teacher or say she didn’t like being called a “loser” — and see what worked. ‘It’s not that the situations have gone away, but now she feels she has the tools to deal with them. Almost a year later, Bella is a different child, more confident, and much less anxious. ‘It’s like a weight has been taken off her shoulders, and mine too,’ says Kate. Kate Harrison says that just a year on her daughter Bella is a different child . Kate believes one reason a life coach worked for Bella is that, as her mother, she had become part of the problem. She says: ‘I felt that because I had become so emotional about the situation, I was probably making things worse.’ Naomi Richards, 39, who has been life-coaching children for eight years, believes modern life has contributed to the growing popularity of counsellors like her. Naomi, author of parenting guide The Parent’s Toolkit, says that children are often less co-operative as they are so absorbed in online activities. Life coach Annie Ashworth, who counsels both adults and children over 12, agrees the rise in demand for life coaching for children has been driven by a changing social picture. In her view, it’s the increasing number of families where mothers work, and so have less time for their children, and the extra pressures that girls are struggling with. ‘I’ve noticed increasing issues with girls and body image,’ she says. ‘There’s so much peer pressure as well the pressure they put themselves under from seeing celebrities.’ But Annie also believes family breakdown is another factor. She often coaches children who say they cannot talk to either parent without feeling as though they are taking sides. Full-time mother Sarah Penney hopes the coaching her daughter Lauren received this summer will help the ten-year-old cope with family dynamics she sometimes finds difficult. Sarah is divorced from Lauren’s father and Lauren now has a stepfather and two half-brothers. Sarah, 41, from Twickenham, took Lauren to Surrey-based coach Lisa Parkes after they began arguing over work she had to do for her 11-plus exam. ‘Lauren was starting to feel very negative about passing the exam, even though she is very capable,’ she says. Lauren also lost her temper on a regular basis, and home was becoming a battleground. ‘Lisa made Lauren feel special, which gave her a confidence boost,’ Sarah says. ‘She had three hour-long sessions, which included ways to handle anger. She’s more positive now and more able to control her temper.’ Tamsin Kirtley, 38, agrees that having an outsider involved in resolving a child’s problems can work wonders. She took her son, Josh, 16, to Lisa Parkes last February when she began to fear he might not even turn up for his GCSEs. Diagnosed with borderline ADHD and Asperger’s syndrome as a young boy, Josh’s behaviour improved as he matured, but his confidence remained low. Tamsin, a book-keeper from Bagshot, Surrey, says her son had about ten hour-long sessions over five months. ‘Lisa listened to what he had to say and tailor-made their sessions to suit his needs, she says. ‘She gave him simple and effective tools to help build up his self-esteem and make him feel more confident about his exams, to focus on what he could do rather what he couldn’t. ‘As a result, he did better than I’d ever imagined. He got 5Bs and 4Cs and recently started sixth form.’ However, Sarah Penney stresses that life coaching ‘is not a magic wand’. While it can help children cope with life better, the parental nurturing role is far from redundant yet.","Kate Harrison's seven-year-old daughter used to sob herself to sleep every night for three months .

Hackers' collective Anonymous claims it has declared 'cyber war' against Israel in retaliation for threats to block Palestinians' internet access. As the Israel Defence Forces began airstrikes against targets in the territory, the hacktivist group  tried to cripple Israeli sites and government networks. The move came as Israel admitted the war is being fought on 'three fronts' - including physical, social networks and cyber attacks - and triggered calls for a 'cyberdome' protective shield to mirror the 'Iron dome' missile defence system. 'Cyber war has been declared on Israel cyber space': A grab from a YouTube video uploaded by Anonymous in which the collective calls on members to target Israeli websites and networks . Israel's finance minister Yuval Steinitz admitted last night that the group - along with other protesters - . bombarded Israeli sites with more than 60million hacking attempts. However, he said most of the attacks failed and that the only site that was successfully brought down was up again within minutes. Anonymous though posted a list of more than 650 Israeli websites it says it has taken down or defaced in retaliation for what it called 'the barbaric, brutal and despicable treatment of the Palestinian people'. In a release published online the group said Israel 'crossed a line in the sand' when it 'publicly threatened to sever all Internet and other telecommunications into and out of Gaza'. 'As the former dictator of Egypt Mubarack learned the hard way - we are ANONYMOUS and NO ONE shuts down the Internet on our watch,' the statement added. A subsequent YouTube video added: 'We call on the Anonymous Collective to hack, deface, docks, hijack, database leak, admin takeover, four oh four and DNS terminate the Israeli Cyberspace by any means necessary. 'To the Israeli Government, Anonymous has grown tired of your bullying, and now you will see the result of your actions. 'Cyber war has been declared on Israel cyber space and you will see exactly what we are capable of.' Attacks from all directions: This screengrab from a hacked website claims the attack to be the work of a Yemeni hacker . Following the statement, Carmela Avner, Israel's chief information officer, admitted over the weekend that the latest war 'is being fought on three fronts'. 'The first is physical, the second is the world of social networks and the third is cyberattacks,' she added. The cyber onslaught began after Israel launched warplanes began bombarding Gaza last week in retaliation for rocket fire from the strip. Among attacks staged on Israeli networks, according to The Daily Dot, Anonymous has claimed to have deleted the database of the Bank of Jerusalem and Ministry of Foreign Affairs; they downed Israel's MSN and defaced Windows.co.il; they have leaked personal data of 5,000 officials and the usernames and passwords to a real estate search site; and took the websites for the IDF, Mastercard and Bing offline. The group also released what it called the Anonymous Gaza Care Package containing instructions in Arabic and English on steps to take if the Israelis shut down internet connections to the strip, as well as information on avoiding online surveillance and basic first aid. Others have joined into what has effectively become a free-for-all attack on Israel. One group, which called itself the Pakistani Cyber Army, claimed responsibility for having hijacked roughly two dozen Israeli-registered sites, including one belonging to Coca-Cola. One of its members, who identified himself only as a Pakistani Muslim, told The Associated Press that more was on the way. 'We won't stop until they stop killing innocent kids and people,' he said. Ready for action: An Israeli pilot readies to climb into the cockpit of an F-15 Eagle fighter jet at an Israeli Air Force Base last night to carry out a sortie in Gaza . Much of the online onslaught has come in the form of denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, a technique that works by overloading a website with traffic, crashing its servers and making it unavailable to users. Tel Aviv-based security company Radware said the attacks against Israel first began surging across the web on Thursday, describing some as well coordinated DoS attacks. Although such attacks can effectively knock their targets off the web, they're usually temporary and rarely do lasting damage. Ronen Kenig, a Radware analyst, said the flow of rogue traffic wasn't as powerful as attacks that hit the U.S. banking sector two months ago. 'In terms of the amount of traffic, it's not massive,' he said, explaining that the attackers were yet to draw on networks of infected computers - known as botnets - to mount their attacks. Botnets are amassed by hackers and can grow to include thousands of compromised computers, giving them much more firepower than a few dozen online activists acting in tandem. Erel Margalit, chairman of Jerusalem Venture Partners, a leading Israeli venture capital firm, has invested significantly in Israel's cybersecurity system but said more must be done. 'Israel has the Iron Dome system (to intercept incoming rockets), but it needs a cyberdome,' he said, noting the government just approved collaboration on the first-ever private cybersecurity incubator to further invest in the industry. 'The start-up nation is also a cybernation, it needs to be defended, and Israel is known to be quite advanced in this field,' he said. Israel is often called the start-up nation because of its technology companies. Blaze: Palestinian firefighters try to extinguish a fire after an Israeli air strike on the Islamic National Bank building in Gaza City this morning . Mr Kenig said his company had seen evidence the attackers were ramping up their efforts. Technolytics Institute, a private U.S. consultancy, said Israel is prepared to confront incoming threats, . rating Israel as fourth behind Russia, China, and the U.S. for . cyberintelligence capabilities - not just defensive, but offensive, as . well. Kevin Coleman, senior fellow at Technolytics, said while Israel has invested significantly in the industry, Anonymous has become a new, threatening 'virtual state' of sorts. 'When you think about conflict in general, you think about borders, but the internet doesn't have borders,' he said. 'So how do you retaliate against a loose coalition? How do you negotiate a cease-fire with Anonymous? 'We're at the tip of the iceberg in figuring out how to deal with virtual states and creating a new paradigm. 'We need to do it quickly, though. This is the warfare of the future.'","Anonymous claims to have defaced more than 650 Israeli websites .

The family of a lottery winner who was poisoned with cyanide the day after he collected his $1million jackpot are at war with his widow amid claims she tried to cash the winning check in the days after his death. Urooj Khan's brother, ImTiaz Khan, has alleged that Shabana Ansari attempted to claim the windfall 'shortly' after Urooj's death but was unable to do so. ImTiaz Khan also claimed that his late brother and Shabana were not even married, meaning that she could miss out on half of the lottery prize to which she is entitled. Scroll down for video . Cruel death: Urooj Khan (pictured right) with his $1million winnings shortly before his death from cyanide poisoning. His wife Shabana Ansari (left) and his teenage daughter from an earlier marriage Jasmeen (second left) are by his side . In another sign the family are tearing themselves apart, Urooj's sister Meraj Khan has launched a  legal bid to take guardianship of his daughter Jasmeen from his first marriage. Meraj wants custody of the 17-year-old even though she appears to have lived with step-mother Shabana at her home in Chicago for most of her life. Miss Ansari's lawyer told MailOnline that his client had been questioned for four hours by police and had 'nothing to hide'. The developments come as the Cook County Medical Examiner is expected to seek a court order to exhume Urooj's body later this week. Family members told MailOnline that they do not wish to see the body if it goes ahead because it will be too traumatizing. It is a tragic turn of events from July 19 last year when a delighted Urooj, 46, collected the over-sized cheque from Illinois State Lottery officials at the 7-Eleven where he bought the winning scratchcard. Legal battle: Meraj Khan (right) has launched a legal battle to take custody of her late brother's 17-year-old daughter from an earlier marriage Jasmeen (left) Mr Urooj's 32-year-old wife Shabana, who moved to the U.S. after marrying him 12 years ago, is pictured at the event. She can be seen wearing a green traditional Indian dress with a scarlet scarf. Her step-daughter Jasmeen stands beside her wearing a grey sari. Urooj is seen smiling widely and told the TV cameras he was going to use the money to pay bills, donate to St Jude's Children's Hospital in Chicago and grow his dry-cleaning business. After taxes, the prize money amounted to $425,000 as he opted to take in a lump sum. The day after receiving his winning cheque, Urooj came home from work and ate a traditional Indian Kofta curry that his wife had prepared. He died a short time later. The initial examination by the Cook County Medical examiner found he had died of heart disease or natural causes. After his death, the winning check was eventually cashed on August 15. However, in probate documents filed with the Cook County Court, ImTiaz Khan suggested that Shabana  had tried to do so before. Foul play: A family member called police to say Khan had not suffered a 'natural death' after he had been buried. His body will now be exhumed to inspect the contents of his last meal . In a September filing, ImTiaz writes: 'Ms Shabana Ansari is in possession of the lottery cheque and is concerned she may attempt to cash the cheque again, as she did shortly after the decedent's (Urooj) death, even though the estate is entitled to the funds'. ImTiaz also alleges that his brother's 'only known heir is his daughter Jasmeen Khan' and pointedly states that Shabana is not her biological mother. He says he wants her to get her 'fair share' and alleges 'there remains question as to whether (Urooj) was married to Ms Ansari' . His filing reads: '(ImTaiz's) counsel was informed by Citibank that (Urooj's) spouse, Ms Shabana Ansari, has been in communication with the bank and believes Ms Ansari may be attempting to control (Urooj's) accounts.' The papers also state: 'Meraj Khan, (Urooj's) sister, filed a petition for Guardian of the minor (Jasmeen) on September 19, 2012.' The day after receiving a check for his winnings, Khan awoke screaming in pain in his bed at his Chicago home (pictured). An expert said this is caused when muscle contract suddenly as the poison kills you 'cell by cell' As a result of the filings last year, the jackpot was frozen and will remain so for the next three months. In response, Ms Ansari filed documents of her own which stated she was indeed married to Urooj and the court agreed, making her the administrator of the estate. The remaining three months will allow family members to make their case to the lawyer organizing how funds will be handed out. In normal circumstances, 50 per cent goes to the spouse and 50 per cent to the children, unless there are grounds for complaint. In one sense Urooj, who emigrated from India in the 1980s, should not even have been gambling in the first place because of his Islamic faith. He had recently returned to Chicago from the Hajj pilgrimage to Saudi Arabia, inspired to lead a better life and had sworn off buying lottery tickets - except just this once. His death would have gone unnoticed as the first toxicology report said Mr Khan died of heart disease. However two months later, a relative called the medical examiner demanding a fresh inquiry into the poisoning as he 'didn't accept it was going to be a natural death', MailOnline earlier revealed. During the dramatic phone call, the family member flatly rejected the original ruling and ordered investigators to have another look. A second, more thorough toxicology report turned up the cyanide poisoning as cause of death. Deborah Blum, a poison expert whose book The Poisoner's Handbook is being made into a PBS TV series, said that Urooj would have been in 'absolute agony' after eating the cyanide. Entrepreneur: Khan emigrated to the U.S. during the 1980s, and had saved enough to open three dry cleaning shops (pictured) on Chicago's Far North side . Ms Blum, a former chemist, said: 'A good lethal dose of cyanide will kill you in ten minutes. A mid-range dose and people die within the hour. For a poison that's pretty fast. 'Cyanide poisoning is a nasty death. There is an enzyme which allows your cells to breathe and the cyanide wipes that enzyme out. 'It suffocates you cell by cell. Symptoms include seizures, extreme shortness of breath and usually cardiac arrest.' In her latest interview, Miss Ansari told the Chicago Sun-Times that she hopes 'God will reveal the truth'. She has previously paid tribute to her husband as a 'workaholic' and vowed to keep his laundry business open to honor his memory.","Urooj Khan's brother alleged in legal papers that his wife Shabana Ansari attempted to claim the windfall 'shortly' after Urooj's painful death .

The Home Office came under fire yesterday when it emerged an illegal immigrant brutally raped a young woman - three years after a judge ordered him to be deported. Abdikarim Abbas Abdisamad, 33, originally from Somalia, befriended a 24-year-old woman in a nightclub claiming he had just lost his job and was penniless. The victim took pity on Abdisamad and invited him to her home where he raped her twice and battered her so severely she suffered 17 separate injuries. Abdikarim Abbas Abdisamad, 33, originally from Somalia, befriended a woman in a nightclub claiming he had just lost his job and was penniless . He was jailed for ten years after being convicted of rape at Coventry Crown Court on Monday. But during the hearing, it emerged Abdisamad was already a convicted criminal and a judge had ordered his deportation in 2009 when he was jailed for six months for grievous bodily harm. But he was allowed to remain in Britain because of his immigration status and civil war in his home country of Somalia. Now bungling Home Office officials are working to finally deport him. Alp Mehmet, vice-chairman of Migration Watch, said: 'Anyone who doesn’t have the right to be here who has been told to get out should leave and leave quickly. 'In essence I would say that those who have no right to be here and who have been sentenced for horrific crimes should go quickly. 'Unfortunately we do have to abide by certain agreements. We should do rather more to change the attitudes and rules and regulations that prevent some people being deported. 'I think there are far too many obstacles put in our way that need to be removed.' Abdisamad, who gave the court an address in London, was in the country on a working visa. The Home Office say that to deport a criminal, certain criteria needed to be met and in Abdisamad’s case that had not happened. Abdisamad was jailed for ten years after being convicted of rape at Coventry Crown Court (pictured) on Monday . But they refused to reveal what part of his immigration status prevented his removal. A spokesman said: 'We always seek to remove foreign offenders convicted of a serious crime once they have been punished. 'That is why we removed more than 4,500 of them last year. 'Removal can be a challenging process and we have to operate within the law.' Abdisamad’s rape victim suffered a broken cheekbone and several deep cuts - requiring stitches after the attack. He was arrested in October after police used items left in his victim’s home in Coventry to trace him to a location in London. Det Con Sunita Sharma, from Coventry Public Protection Unit, said: 'To see this man be given such a long custodial sentence is extremely satisfying for both his victim and those of us who have investigated the case and supported her throughout. 'The young lady thought he was a genuine guy, down on his luck and unaware of what fate lay in store. 'She has been left afraid to stay in her own home and unable to trust her own judgement or any man again. 'I hope this sentence offers some relief to the victim, and we admire her courage in speaking up to bring her attacker to justice.' Abdisamad, who admitted one count of rape but was found not guilty of another, was also put on the sex offender’s register for life. A count of assault occasioning actual bodily harm was ordered to lie on file.","The 33-year-old raped the woman twice and battered her so severely she had 17 injuries .

It has more than three times the power than the previous title-holder and is capable of performing eight quadrillion calculations each second. High-tech: The K supercomputer at Riken's laboratory in Kobe, contains 672 racks with a total of 68,544 CPUs . A quadrillion is one followed by 15 zeroes and in computer jargon the speed is known as 8.2 petaflops. The previous fastest machine was the Chinese computer Tianhe-1A, which was clocked at 2.507 petaflops and highlighted the emergence of China's growing technological and economic power. The Tianhe- 1A machine was the first time China had topped the speed list, wrestling the title from the U.S. who had four of the top ten supercomputers. Experts said the development of the K machine, which is faster than five of its closest competitors combined, marks a giant leap forward in technology. 'It's a very impressive machine - it's a lot more powerful than the other computers,' said Professor Jack Dongarra, who releases a six-monthly list of the world's top supercomputers. The speed rankings are based by running a standard mathematical equation. The bragging rights for Japan's K computer, which has cost $1.2bn to develop, marks a return to the top for the first time in seven years. Impressive: The computer is faster than five of its nearest rivals and marks a giant leap forward in technology . Developed at RIKEN Advanced Institute for Computational Science in Kobe, Japan, the giant computer is housed in a climate-controlled, warehouse-like structure. It consists of 672 cabinets filled with circuit boards containing almost 70,000 processors. A family computer or laptop uses a single processor. The K supercomputer uses enough energy to power 10,000 homes and although its creators claim the machine is energy efficient, its running costs are put at £6m a year. 'Use of the K computer is expected to have a groundbreaking impact in fields ranging from global climate research, meteorology, disaster prevention, and medicine, thereby contributing to the creation of a prosperous and secure society,' a spokesman for the RIKEN institute said. Fujitsu and RIKEN chiefs say the project had overcome difficulties posed by the March 11 earthquake and tsunami that devastated the country's northeast Tohoku region.

Staff at the BBC were last night urged to come forward with information as a nationwide police inquiry was launched into Sir Jimmy Savile’s alleged reign of child abuse. It came as more women said they were raped or molested as girls by the ‘predatory’ BBC presenter. At least six police forces have now received allegations of abuse, and the Metropolitan Police has been chosen to co-ordinate inquiries. Nationwide inquiry: Staff at the BBC have been urged to come forward with information about Jimmy Savile's alleged reign of abuse as at least six police forces revealed they had received allegations . A Scotland Yard spokeman said: ‘The assessment will be undertaken by the Serious Case Team of the Met’s Child Abuse Investigation Command. ‘Our priority will be to ensure a proportionate and consistent policing response putting the victims at the heart of our enquiries.’ The Met urged potential victims to contact their local police stations. The BBC’s director of editorial policy, David Jordan, told ITV News that the corporation’s employees should tell police what they know. ‘It is very important that anybody who knows anything, who has evidence, or saw anything, gets in touch with their local police force. ‘The BBC is appalled that these acts could have happened on BBC premises and been conducted by one of the BBC’s great stars of the past.’ Alleged victim: Among the women making chilling accusations about Savile is Karin Ward (above), who claims she was abused in the presenter's dressing room aged 14 . He also said the broadcaster may now air footage gathered for the abandoned Newsnight investigation into Savile’s alleged abuse. The decision to axe the BBC2 film, not long after the presenter’s death, sparked anger among the corporation’s journalists and led to speculation it was to protect the BBC’s reputation. Appearing on the BBC News channel, Mr Jordan said: ‘I can’t see why [the footage] couldn’t be broadcast in some way or another. If the women concerned who have given the evidence want that to happen, I’m sure it can happen.’ During a tumultuous week for the BBC, at least ten women have alleged Savile sexually abused them as youngsters. On Monday, six women were revealed to have made chilling accusations about Savile in an explosive ITV documentary. It prompted a seventh woman to walk into a Surrey police station and allege Savile raped her at 15 in 1986 when she was on work experience at the BBC. On Tuesday, two more women, Katrina Rose and Bebe Roberts, were the first to bravely waive their anonymity and claim they too were victims of the Jim’ll Fix It star. The next day, another woman told the Mail she had been raped and made pregnant by Savile when she was a 16-year-old virgin. The woman, now 65, was forced to have an illegal abortion without painkillers, and spent two years paying back her grandmother for the cost of the procedure. Since then, several more women have contacted the Mail, ITV News and the police with further allegations. Among them, Karin Ward claimed she was abused in Savile’s dressing room aged 14 at the same time as paedophile Gary Glitter was raping a 13-year-old girl. Glitter, jailed twice over child abuse, has rejected the allegation. Disturbing claims: Mrs Ward alleges that while she was being abused by Savile in his dressing room, paedophile Gary Glitter, seen here on Jim'll Fix It in 1991, was raping a 13-year-old girl . The BBC has been accused of turning a blind eye to the abuse and allowing one of its biggest stars to boast that he was ‘untouchable’. It emerged the presenter – who died last year aged 84 – was interviewed under caution by Surrey Police in 2007, but no charges were brought. He had allegedly preyed on vulnerable under-age girls at now-defunct Duncroft School in Surrey, bursting into their bedrooms when they were undressing. At the BBC, girls who appeared on Top of the Pops and Jim’ll Fix It said they were groomed by Savile who forced himself on them in his dressing room, his Rolls-Royce and in his caravan. Several women have alleged BBC staff including producers were told of the abuse and ignored it. In Jersey, up to five girls abused at the Haut de le Garenne children’s home named Savile, their solicitor Alan Collins said yesterday. Probe widens: It has also emerged that up to five girls abused at the Haut de le Garenne children's home (above) in Jersey named Savile . Girls as young as nine were allegedly molested by the Radio One DJ at the Jersey ‘house of horrors’. Mr Collins said: ‘Jimmy Savile’s name came up several times. I interviewed people who claimed to have suffered abuse at the home, and several told me they had been abused there by Savile.’ Ex-BBC press officer Rodney Collins, who reported newspaper rumours against Savile to his superiors in 1973, said last night: ‘There should be a full inquiry, they should co-operate with the police. If anyone working there at the time had some knowledge of this they should speak up.’ A BBC spokesman added: ‘We have asked the BBC investigations unit to make direct contact with all the police forces in receipt of allegations and offer to help them investigate these matters and provide full support to any lines of inquiry they wish to pursue.’ The Met said: ‘We will be making contact with all those concerned in due course. We will be working closely with the BBC investigations unit.’","Metropolitan Police to co-ordinate nationwide inquiry into alleged child abuse .

"By . Damien Gayle . PUBLISHED: . 05:26 EST, 12 November 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 05:26 EST, 12 November 2012 . An influential blogger has launched a new service that posts satellite images of areas hit by U.S. drone strikes as an Instagram feed. Dronestagram posts images drone strike locations from Google Maps Satellite view to the popular photo-sharing service along with short summaries of what's there. The online service is the brainchild of London-based writer James Bridle, who has earned world-wide reknown for his New Aesthetic blog which aims to describe how now-ubiquitous computer networks change how we perceive the world. Dronestagram: The service posts images of the locations of drone strikes from Google Maps Satellite view to Instagram along with short summaries of what's there . He said Dronestagram is his way of 'making these locations just a little bit more visible, a little closer. A little more real. On his booktwo.org blog, Mr Bridle added: 'Drones are just the latest in a long line of military technologies augmenting the process of death-dealing, but they are among the most efficient, the most distancing, the most invisible. 'These qualities allow them to do what they do unseen, and create the context for secret, unaccountable, endless wars. 'Whether you think these killings are immoral or not, most of them are by any international standard illegal.' With the UK and U.S. militaries unforthcoming about the activities of their drone fleets, Mr Bridle's Instagram feed - which is syndicated to Tumblr and Twitter - reports records of strikes drawn mainly from the Bureau of Investigative Journalism. The BIJ compiles reports from Pakistan, Yemen and Somalia and, as well as providing the satellite image, Dronestagram augments these with a variety of sources to offer more background on the targets hit. Death from above: A U.S. Predator drone. The U.S. claims that 98 to 99 per cent of its targets are legitimate; critics claim the reverse is true with civilians making up the bulk of drone strike victims . The service is similar to the mooted . iPhone app Drones Plus, which would have alerted users whenever a person . was killed by a U.S. drone strike, but was rejected by Apple. The Silicon Valley tech giant refused . to add the program to its App store three times, with it's latest . rejection letter calling the app's content 'objectionable and crude'. The U.S. military is seeking contractors to build it miniature 'suicide drones' that can be flown into targets up to six miles away. The little planes, which could look like the remote-controlled aircraft used in a more domestic setting, could be used for kamikaze-style attacks on vehicles or buildings - even individuals if necessary. The Army wants the weapons, known as the 'Lethal Miniature Aerial Munition System' (LMAMS) into war by 2016, and describe the weapon as a 'portable, covert weapon with strike capability against stationary or moving individuals, with a very low risk of collateral damage'. The 'plane' will consist of a drone, warhead and launching device with a maximum weight of less than five pounds. The number of casualties caused by . U.S. drone strikes alone has quadrupled under the Obama administration, . although the ethics of the highly secretive operations was off the . agenda during the recent Presidential election. The U.S. military claims that between 98 and 99 per cent of those killed by drones are legitimate militant targets, but independent studies claim the overwhelming number of victims are in fact civilians. The UK military has, if anything, been even cagier about the use of its drone fleet, although Defence Minister Philip Dunne was last week forced to admit that British reaper drones have fired at 349 Afghan targets since 2008. Mr Bridle points out that means that in that time British forces have launched one drone strike every four days. For Mr Bridle, using Instagram to highlight the remote areas hit by the drones is just one way in which technology is changing the way we can map the course of history. 'History, like space, is co-produced by us and our technologies: those technologies include satellite mapping, social photo sharing from handheld devices, and fleets of flying death robots,' he said. 'We should engage with them at every level. These are just images of foreign landscapes, still; yet we have got better at immediacy and intimacy online: perhaps we can be better at empathy too.'","Drone strikes will be reported as an Instagram feed syndicated to Tumblr and Twitter .

New allegations: Two more people have lodged complaints against Jimmy Savile, who died last year . Two more alleged victims of Sir Jimmy Savile have come forward, meaning four police forces have now received complaints against the TV presenter. Northamptonshire Police said it has been contacted by two members of the public with allegations that occurred outside the county that will therefore be referred to other forces. The news comes as police across the country issued advice to anyone who thinks they might be a victim, and the Association of Chief Police Officers said the national child protection unit CEOP would assess the scale of the allegations. It follows the screening of a documentary aired last night amid growing allegations against the late Top Of The Pops host. Historic accounts, which detailed how the presenter allegedly targeted girls in his BBC dressing room and private Rolls-Royce, were shown after Surrey Police confirmed it had referred a historic rape allegation against the Jim’ll Fix It star to Scotland Yard. Surrey Police has also confirmed it investigated Sir Jimmy over abuse claims in 2007, but dropped the case due to a lack of evidence, while Jersey and Sussex Police said they had both received complaints about the star. Scotland Yard added last night that it was also assessing a small number of other allegations. In Exposed: The Other Side Of Jimmy Savile, a total of five women claimed they were indecently assaulted by the TV and radio personality when they were schoolgirls in the late 1960s and 1970s. Two of the alleged victims said they first had sexual relations with the TV and radio personality when they were 15 - with a number of the indecent acts taking place in his dressing room at BBC television centre. Another two women who attended Duncroft Approved School For Girls, a now-closed children’s home in Surrey, claimed they were targeted by Sir Jimmy when he regularly visited the school in the 1970s. The revelations came after former Duncroft pupil Karin Ward, another alleged victim who waived her right to anonymity, claimed the star would ply girls with gifts and have sex with pupils as young as 14. Coleen Nolan also revealed that Sir Jimmy suggested she join him at a hotel following a TV recording when she was just 14. She had been in the Top Of The Pops studio, along with her chart star sisters who were appearing on the show. Reputation in tatters: An ex-BBC press officer has claimed that the former head of Radio 1 was aware in the early 1970s of sexual abuse allegations involving Sir Jimmy .

Meanwhile, a circular gold plaque displayed in Scarborough as a memorial to Sir Jimmy, who had a home in the town, was subject to a graffiti attack with the words 'rapist' and 'paedophile'. Authorities in North Yorkshire say they are now reviewing security at the cemetery where his headstone was placed, following his death at the age of 84 last year. A statue of the star has also been taken down in Glasgow. The BBC said it will assist police with investigations into the child abuse claims surrounding the presenter.

PC sales have have gone into freefall with a 14 per cent drop last year - the biggest slump in history. HP, the world's largest PC maker, saw the sharpest decline with 24 per cent fewer machines sold in 2012 compared to 2011. Dell also saw an 11 per cent slump and even Apple, which saw a seven per cent fall, was unable to buck the trend. Research firm IDC said it was the biggest decline overall since it began began tracking this data in 1994. Analysts said that ‘the days seem to be numbered for the humble PC’ and that in the future we would all be using portable devices. Even the launch of Windows 8 failed to stop the trend with some saying the negative response to the software may have exacerbated the trend. PC makers have in recent years tried a string of innovations to breathe life into the market including Ultrabooks which were poorly received. Experts say the success of the iPad and smartphone has led to the slump in PC sales, with people preferring gadgets they can carry with them . Windows 8 was also criticised for making too many changes and getting rid of the iconic start button. The figures show that the late Apple founder Steve Jobs’ prediction that we are headed for a ‘post-PC era’ is coming true. Bob O’Donnell, program vice president for clients and displays at IDC, said that what he called the ‘radical changes’ made to the PC in recent years had done it more harm than good. He said: ‘At this point, unfortunately, it seems clear that the Windows 8 launch not only failed to provide a positive boost to the PC market, but appears to have slowed the market. ‘Microsoft will have to make some very tough decisions moving forward if it wants to help reinvigorate the PC market’. Microsoft also came under fire for the slump, with critics saying its Windows 8 software confused users . Some 350 million personal computers are sold each year, but the numbers are nothing compared to more portable options. Some 919 million smartphones will be sold this year and 200 million tablets, taking their total comfortably over one billion. Research firm Gartner also released similar figures which showed a 11 per cent decline in PC sales, the biggest drop since 2001.

At just 22, Reverend Jude Davis began preaching from her parish, Doncaster Minster, Yorkshire. She studied Theology at Cambridge University for three years before being ordained into the Church of England two years ago. Jude Davis has become the UK's youngest priest at the age of 24 and is part of a growing trend of young people joining the clergy . 24-year-old Jude Davis is able to perform weddings, funerals and baptisms as well as ordinary services . Her role as the UK's youngest priest involves taking services, conducting weddings, funerals and baptisms and preaching at St George's Church in Doncaster. She is one of just 11 per cent of full-time Church of England clergy under the age of 40 in Britain. Jude, now 24, said: ‘A lot of what I do is very specific to where you are working as you have to know the people. A rigorous nine-month selection process and two years of training is required for those wishing to become a priest . Reverend Jude Davis at her parish, Doncaster Minster, Yorkshire, is the youngest Church of England priest in the UK . ‘I try to support local schools and colleges and help youngsters who may be facing tough challenges in their lives. ‘My favourite part of the job is probably when people come to us for the occasional things such as weddings or funerals. ‘They are important events in people's lives and they are very special as they invite you into their lives. ‘You can share their good times but at the same time help them through really bad times, while offering guidance and support. ‘It's . very rare that in today's society that people give you an invitation to . talk to you about your faith and to talk about God and Jesus and it's . nice to take that opportunity without abusing that trust.’ Reverend Jude Davis studied Theology at Cambridge University for three years before being ordained into the Church of England . At . just 19 years old, Jude, from Sheffield, Yorkshire, was forced to go . through a nine-month interview process to ensure she was right for the . role. She undertook years of training before becoming a curate, and in the second year of her curacy became a priest. She said: ‘It's a very . rigorous selection process - you have to go through a series of . interviews with different people, both locally and nationally. ‘You do a number exercises and presentations to check that you are right. Jude Davis says her favourite part of being a priest is performing weddings and funerals for people in her parish . ‘At . any time throughout the process, the Church can say no to you if they . feel you don't suit the position, but luckily they kept letting me . through.’ Jude had set her heart on becoming a priest at just 17, while studying for her A-levels. ‘I . was brought up in a Christian household, went to a Church of England . school and was encouraged to follow the Christian faith,’ she said. There are three orders of clergy : . deacons, priests and bishops. Deacons conduct services, visit the sick, . can baptise, take funerals and so on. Priests can do all of a deacon's . ministry with the addition that they can absolve from sin, give God's . blessing and bless the bread and wine at Holy Communion. Bishops can do all of a deacon and priest's ministry but can also confirm and ordain. All other 'ranks' are administrative. A curate is a deacon or priest who is assistant to a parish priest either permanently or as a trainee. Vicars and rectors are priests in charge of a . parish and have . pastoral responsibility to everyone in the parish whether church members . or not. A Canon or Prebendary (depending on the tradition of the diocese) is a vicar who has been given an honorary title and a seat in the Cathedral chapter in return for preaching at the Cathedral once or twice a year, acting as a chaplain and other duties. The Dean of a cathedral is the . vicar of the Cathedral Church in which the Bishop is actually a guest. The dean, and not the bishop, is actually in charge of the cathedral. The Bishop is the leader of a . group of archdeaconries called a diocese. His throne - the 'cathedral' - . is housed in the main church of the diocese - the cathedral. The archbishop is a senior bishop with oversight of a group of dioceses called a province. In England there are two archbishops - the Archbishop of Canterbury, and the Archbishop of York. The Archbishop of Canterbury is not just the archbishop of the Canterbury province, but also Primate of All England and the spiritual leader of the whole of the Anglican Church worldwide. ‘It was normalised to me and it felt like a normal way of life. ‘I . was lucky because there were a lot of young people in my church so for . us it was normal to go to church and lead a religious lifestyle. ‘I . knew I wanted to work with people and needed variety to keep me . interested so I knew becoming a priest was a realistic choice.’ Jude has only recently discovered she . is the youngest priest in the UK, after Canon Dr Paul Shackerley, who . she supports, checked the Church of England official records. She . said: ‘I suspected for a while that I may be the youngest as it's very . obvious when you're lined up with a load of middle aged men! ‘I have friends who I trained with who are close to my age but I was younger than them all.’ With . the profession becoming increasingly popular in younger people, Jude is . fully supportive of others entering the Church earlier in life. She said: ‘I think if this is something they want to do when they are 19 or 20 they should do it. ‘Although young priests have less life experience, it's good to be young in the job as you can relate to younger people. ‘You do need people who enter the faith at the age of 40, but it's good to have a mixture of both. ‘It's nice being this young and doing something I know is right to me, while I know I'm making a difference.’ A Church of England spokesman said: 'Jude is part of an increasing trend in the Church of England towards younger people coming forward to train as priests. 'In 2012, 22 per cent of those coming forward were under 30, the highest number for the past 20 years.' All clergymen start out as curates, and can progress to become priests after two years in curacy. Later in their careers they have opportunity to become vicars or rectors, then deans or archbishops. The UK's youngest person to be ordained is Adam Young, of Saltburn, Yorkshire, who became a curate at the age of 23.","Jude Davis wanted to join the clergy from the age of 17 and studied theology .

The BBC chose not to televise the Queen Mother’s 100th birthday celebrations because it clashed with Neighbours, the event organiser claims. The decision not to broadcast the celebrations back in 2000 drew criticism from politicians and the BBC’s own broadcasters as Britons were left puzzled as to why it was not deemed worthy for coverage. Now Major Sir Michael Parker, who produced the celebration at Horse Guards Parade in London, as well as the Queen’s Silver and Golden Jubilees and the Royal Tournament, has claimed that the event would have interrupted the schedule for Neighbours, a popular Australian soap. Claims of a clash: The Queen Mother's 100th birthday procession on July 19, 2000 (pictured) was not broadcast by the BBC. Event organiser Major Sir Michael Parker claims it was because the broadcast would clash with Neighbours . The 71-year-old said that in the lead up to the event on July 19, 2000, he was told in discussions with the BBC that the corporation did not want it to disrupt their normal broadcast that night. In his book, It’s all going Terribly Wrong: The Accidental Showman, he wrote: ‘The BBC had just told me that they would not be covering the celebration as they had in 1990. ‘One snooty producer (who will remain nameless, although he has since turned into a right royal sycophant) said that it was an event of little importance and of no interest to the public and anyway its timing clashed with Neighbours.’ 'Of little importance': The Queen Mother with Prince Charles during the procession at the event organised by Sir Michael Parker who claims that the BBC thought it was 'of no interest to the public' Soap takeover: Sir Parker claims that the BBC would not let the Royal event clash with the popular soap which starred Jackie Woodburne as Susan Kennedy and Alan Fletcher as Karl Kennedy . The BBC has always denied that the normal programming was the reason why they did not broadcast the celebrations. Claims it was neighbours: Sir Michael produced the event in Horse Guards Parade which featured more than 300 charities the Queen Mother supported . A BBC spokesman said today: ‘We thought long . and hard about covering the event, but decided that Her Majesty’s . birthday itself (on August 4) should be the main priority.’ The . broadcaster did a two-hour outside broadcast on the Queen Mother's . actual birthday as well as documentaries on radio stations. The Queen Mother’s 100th birthday procession featured more than 300 charities she supported as well as civilians and soldiers. ITV ended up covering the parade with live coverage that was watched by more than seven million viewers as compared to BBC1’s alternative including Neighbours, Newsround and the news which attracted just 3.5 million viewers. Tony Blair, Prime Minister at the time, the Prince of Wales and BBC broadcasters including Jonathan Dimbleby, criticised BBC’s decision. The decision was defended by Alan Yentob, the then head of television and Greg Dyke, the then director general of BBC. Sir Parker said: ‘I introduced myself to Greg Dyke…a couple of years later, he groaned and told me it was one of the worst decisions he had ever made.’ He was amazed that there was no interest in broadcasting the event. Mr Dimbleby said that it was terrible decision that did not reflect what the public wanted. He said: ‘The BBC, of all institutions, should not miss the mood on those kind of questions.’ 'Main priority': The BBC decided that it was more important to cover the Queen Mother's actual birthday on August 4 (pictured with daughters Princess Margaret and the Queen on the balcony .

The base is built every year and prepared for three-quarters of a year of self-sufficient running. Some areas can have sunlight for six months of the year, and night for the other six months. Parts of Finland and Norway are among the most affected. In some regions of Finland there is permanent daylight for 73 days during the summer. Areas in Norway may also experience 24 hour daylight from April 19 though to mid-August. In winter, these areas have what is called 'polar nights' - when the sun does not rise. Places within 5 degrees of the Arctic Circles, or 60 degrees from the equator, may experience the opposite, known as 'white nights.' This is a time when the sun remains at the horizon line, creating twilight instead of night. White nights can last close to three weeks. In St. Petersburg in Russia, there are festivals to celebrate white nights for 10 days at the end of June. Food, fuel and equipment are ferried in over land and by air while personnel work on maintaining the base and its equipment. The last plane left the base in February, signalling the start of winter and the isolation it brings. Temperatures can drop to –80°C and the Sun does not rise above the horizon for around four months, leaving the base in permanent darkness.

'Astronomers, glaciologists, seismologists and a meteorologist are supported by a plumber, electrician, mechanic and cook, among others, to form a team and survive the long winter.' ESA has also sent a medical doctor to study the multicultural crew as they adapt and work together.

A mother has told how her three-year-old daughter died from meningitis after a GP misdiagnosed the killer disease as flu. Brave Chloe Cain had been vomiting for days and had been completely unable to walk when her mother Tara, 29, rushed her to the doctor on March 24. After spending 20 minutes with the child, Tara claims the GP concluded Chloe just had a bug and prescribed pain killers. Grief-stricken: Tara Cain is devastated after her daughter Chloe's symptoms were mistaken for a bout of flu and ultimately cost her life . But the following night the Chloe suffered a massive seizure at home and was taken by ambulance to the Queen's Medical Centre in Nottingham. After a series of tests carried out over the following two days, Tara was given the crushing news that Chloe had cryptococcal meningitis. Cryptococcal meningitis is caused by a fungus found in soil all over the world. It tends to affect those with a weakened immune system. Unlike bacterial meningitis, this form of meningitis comes on more slowly, over the course of a few days to weeks. Symptoms include fever, hallucinations, headache, nausea and vomiting, sensitivity to light and a stiff neck. Chloe did not suffer the tell-tale stiff neck or rash associated with the infection. Just one week later on April 4 her life support machine was switched off - after the killer bug took grip of the youngster's tiny body. Today furious Tara, from Nottingham, slammed the GP who wrongly diagnosed her daughter. She said: ‘I am fuming at the way they shrugged off what I was saying and said it was flu. Three-year-old Chloe loved dancing, playing in the park and going to nursery before she tragically died . ‘They just sent me on my way with Ibuprofen and paracetamol. ‘If they had done their jobs correctly then it might've been sorted out by tackling it sooner. They just gave me no support whatsoever. ‘They wanted to take a urine sample to get to the bottom of it, but because she kept throwing up the water they just stopped trying. ‘When she was finally taken in she was attached to a ventilator to help her breathe and they diagnosed her with meningitis. I was heartbroken. Tara Cain is desperate to raise awareness about the disease that killed her daughter . ‘I was begging for her to get better. It was killing me. I really was 50;50 as to whether she was going to live or not. ‘It was always my worst fear that she would get meningitis as my cousin's baby had it and it took him a long time to recover. ‘So I always prayed this wouldn't happen to my daughter.’ Tara is now desperate to raise awareness of the condition as her daughter did not show any of the normal symptoms of meningitis such as a rash or stiff neck. She will be doing a parachute jump next month to raise money for The Meningitis Trust. Chloe will have a small funeral with only a few friends and family, which will be held next Wednesday. Paying tribute to her daughter, Tara added: ‘She loved Tinkerbell and Fireman Sam, and loved dancing and playing down the park. ‘My fondest memory of her was when she would wake up at 3am asking to go to nursery. ‘Sometimes I would be downstairs in the early hours of the morning unable to sleep and Chloe would come bouncing down the stairs asking to go to nursery. ‘She just loved going there. Some kids would kick and scream when they were dropped off at school, but not Chloe, she would have lived there if she could.’","Chloe Cain had vomited for days and was completely unable to walk .

Basketball great Kobe Bryant took to social media in the hours after suffering his most serious injury amid fears that his legendary career could be over. He posted pictures on Instagram of him in the hospital as he prepared for surgery on his ruptured Achilles tendon, which was injured during Friday night's win over the Golden State Warriors. 'Surgery prep time. Lookin like Mrs Doubtfire with a jerri curl cap lol Anesthesia next #highasakite #mambaout,' he posted Saturday afternoon. Some even wonder whether this was the injury that could be the end to his extraordinary career. Scroll down for video . Surgery time: Kobe Bryant posted this picture to Instagram as he was prepped and ready to undergo surgery on his ruptured Achilles tendon . The basketball great also shared this picture as he laid on the MRI table. His apparent upbeat mood is a stark contrast to his emotional state immediately following the injury . Bryant's pictures show him smiling and giving the peace sign - a stark contrast to his mood immediately following injuring his ankle. Walking around: Kobe Bryant's wife Vanessa posted this picture of him walking around on his crutches with a protective boot around his injured left ankle . Bryant called it the most disappointing injury of his career 'by far.' Moments after he went down, Bryant vowed to get back up. 'I . know I can do this,' said Bryant, who's averaging 27.3 points, 5.6 . rebounds and 6.0 assists. 'It's fueling me. It's fueling me. I can feel . it already.' Still . wearing his gold game uniform, Bryant solemnly took questions while . thinking about the upcoming final days of the Lakers' tumultuous season. Later, he went on Facebook to post a rant where the normally stoic athlete showed a rare display of vulnerability and doubt. 'All the training and sacrifice flew out the window with one step I've done a million times,' the five-time NBA champion wrote. 'Makes no damn sense. Now I'm supposed to come back from this and be the same player or better at age 35?!? 'How in the world am I supposed to do that? 'Maybe this is how my book ends. Maybe Father Time has defeated me.' But he then added, 'Then again maybe not! 'One day, the beginning of a new career journey will commence. Today is NOT that day,' he vowed. The star athlete showed a rare vulnerable side in his early morning Facebook rant following his devastating injury . Vanessa Bryant also posted these images of doctors marking her husband's leg prior to surgery . Bryant, in his 17th NBA season, felt a pop as he pushed off his left foot during the game. The pain made him think somebody kicked him, causing him to tumble to the floor. 'I made a move that I've made a . million times, and it just popped,' he said while appearing to bite back . tears as he leaned on crutches in the Lakers' locker room after a . 118-116 win over Golden State. The . fourth-leading scorer in NBA history probably will miss the postseason . for just the second time, even if Los Angeles hangs on to the eighth . spot in the Western Conference playoff race without him. The . 34-year-old who has spent half his life in a Lakers uniform realizes . everybody will wonder if his career will ever be the same. Down: Los Angeles Lakers guard Kobe Bryant grimaces in pain after injuring his left Achilles tendon during the second half of their NBA basketball game against the Golden State Warriors on Friday . Game time: Bryant, a five-time NBA champion seen center before his injury on Friday, has played more than 38 minutes per game, more than any teammate and more than any player in the league over 30 . VIDEO: WATCH KOBE BRYANT'S TUMBLE HERE . Kick: Bryant said it felt like he had been kicked in his foot before taking his tumble on the court . Support: Teammates Pau Gasol (second left), Jodie Meeks (left), and Steve Blake (right) stand around Bryant before helping him walk off the court . Comforted: Teammate Pau Gasol comforts Bryant as they head court side together after his traumatic injury . After a terrible start and numerous missteps along the way, Los Angeles (42-37) is one game ahead of the Utah Jazz, who hold the tiebreaker, for the final playoff spot in the West with two games to play. Asked how he was immediately feeling, he said both angry and sad. 'We worked so hard to put ourselves in position and control our fate,' he said. 'I certainly have done a lot of work to prepare myself. It's just bad luck.' Bryant, who scored 34 points despite hyperextending his left knee early in the second half, hit two free throws after apparently tearing his tendon with 3:08 to play, tying the game before hobbling to the locker room. His teammates then rallied past the wilting Warriors, with Pau Gasol and Dwight Howard getting big baskets down the stretch before Steve Blake's go-ahead free throws in the final minutes. Hopeful: Lakers forward Metta World Peace, right rubs Kobe's shoulders as head coach Mike D'Antoni looks on . Benched: Bryant puts his head in his hands as head coach Mike D'Antoni leans over him . The win kept the Lakers in control of their playoff destiny, still in the running for the franchise's 16th postseason trip during Bryant's career, they'll probably have to do it without the five-time NBA champion in uniform, assuming an MRI on Saturday confirms the Lakers' diagnosis of a torn tendon. 'I'm going to be there still,' Bryant said. 'I can't be with them out there on the floor, but I can use my intellect to try to break down film and help them see things they might not see.' But after playing heavy minutes all season while fighting several minor injuries, one of the most durable stars in NBA history finally incurred an injury even he couldn't play through. 'I can't walk,' he said, with only a trace of a smirk. 'I tried to maybe just put pressure on my heel, see if I could do it that way, but there was just nothing there.' Achilles' tendon injuries can require many months of rehabilitation and recovery, depending on their severity, and the 34-year-old Bryant has enormous mileage on his legs. The NBA's No. 3 scorer this season has played more than 38 minutes per game, more than any teammate and more than any player in the league over 30. Emotional: Kobe appeared quite emotional while describing himself in a press conference after as both angry and sad . Determined: Bryant tweeted this message early Saturday morning expressing his determination to recover, while jokingly noting his alleged use of the painkiller, Vicodin . While others' thoughts immediately went past the Lakers' immediate future to Bryant's career, he swiftly shot down any notion he might be finished. Bryant was already thinking about rehabilitation from an injury that typically requires several months of recovery. 'I've never had to deal with something like this,' he said. 'It is a new experience for me. Obviously, there have been a bunch of players that have had the same injury. All I can do is look at them, see what they've done, and see who had more success coming back quicker and healthier. See what they did, and try to improve on that.' Bryant said his teammates must 'just continue to play. We've been dealing with injuries all year. I'll do what I can, watching film and communicating to the guys the best form of attacking certain teams, and go from there.' The Lakers' future is tied up in Bryant's health even beyond his vaunted scoring and leadership: He will make nearly $30.5 million next season in the final year of his deal. Los Angeles' uncertain offseason just got even weirder, with Howard's impending unrestricted free agency still looming largest in the mix. Painful reality: Bryant, seen shooting a free throw during the first half of the game, later said he knew something was terribly wrong being unable to walk without crutches . Million dollar contract: Kobe is to make nearly $30.5 million next season in the final year of his deal with the Lakers . Bryant has been ferociously competitive while trying to keep the Lakers' playoff hopes afloat. While Gasol and Steve Nash have missed long stretches of play with injuries, and while Howard struggled to get to full strength after last year's back surgery, Bryant played through a sprained ankle and countless minor woes, missing only two games with injuries that could sideline other players for weeks. After playing all 48 minutes while scoring 47 points in Portland on Wednesday, Bryant pushed the Lakers relentlessly forward on one good leg against the playoff-bound Warriors. Golden State got 47 points from Stephen Curry in a dynamic performance, but Bryant led a 9-0 run by hitting consecutive 3-pointers to tie it at 107 with 3:47 left. 'I hate it for Kobe,' said first-year Lakers coach Mike D'Antoni, who has marveled at Bryant's toughness while discounting suggestions Bryant was playing too much. 'I hate it for us. I hate it for L.A., but you have to close ranks. There's no going back now. ... He's just an unbelievable player with a heart, and it is unbelievable.' Bryant didn't know whether his heavy workload contributed to the injury. 'Who knows? It was all necessary,' he said. 'It's just a freak situation, I guess.' Bryant's teammates had little to say to him in the locker room, many still in disbelief over the latest injury woe to befall this high-priced roster. 'He's the greatest competitor, and he's been that all season long, all through his career,' said Gasol, who had 26 points, 11 rebounds and 10 assists in his sixth career triple-double. 'He's been an example for us throughout all this. He showed character. He showed heart, and that's what we're going to need from now on.'","Bryant, 34, emotionally called Friday night's injury his most disappointing 'by far'

Ed Miliband tonight said it 'beggars belief' that Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt is still in his job after an email claimed he asked the Murdoch empire to help him stop a phone hacking inquiry. The Labour leader said today the 'accumulation of evidence' about the minister's close ties with News Corp meant that his position was untenable. At the time the latest bombshell email was sent, Mr Hunt was supposed to be the independent arbiter who decided whether the company's bid to buy out BSkyB was successful. The message asked News Corp to ‘advise him privately’ as the News of the World was engulfed in hacking allegations. The disclosure is another blow to Mr . Hunt, already fighting to save his career over claims about his handling . of the Murdochs’ £8billion takeover bid. It also implicated . Downing Street in the row for the first time. Today Mr Miliband said that Mr Hunt had the Murdoch's interests and not the government's interests at heart. 'One of the reasons so many people hate politics so much right now is that they think politicians stand up for the wrong people, not the right people,' he said. 'This is a clear example of that - Jeremy Hunt was standing up for Rupert Murdoch, not for the public interest. 'Out of touch with the many. Too close to the few. Jeremy Hunt should go.' In the email sent on June 27 last . year, a News Corporation lobbyist told Mrs Brooks, then one of Mr . Murdoch’s most senior UK executives, that Mr Hunt was poised to make an . ‘extremely helpful’ statement about their company’s proposed acquisition . of BSkyB. Frederic Michel . suggested the Culture Secretary would give a green light to the bid . because he believes ‘phone hacking has nothing to do with the media . plurality issues’. It also said Mr Hunt ‘wants to prevent a public . inquiry’ into the culture of phone hacking at the News of the World. Pressure: Rebekah Brooks, pictured at the . Leveson Inquiry yesterday, received an email from News Corp's Fred Michel claiming Jeremy Hunt, right, was asking him for 'private advice' The email raises questions about the Culture Secretary’s close relationship with the Murdoch empire. Mr Hunt’s special adviser Adam Smith resigned last month after it emerged that he secretly passed Mr Michel privileged information on News Corp’s takeover bid for BSkyB while Mr Hunt was supposed to be ruling on the bid as an impartial, quasi-judicial watchdog. Mr Hunt, who has insisted he acted with propriety throughout and did not know what Mr Smith was doing, yesterday insisted the latest email was ‘completely inaccurate’. His spokesman pointed out that soon after the email exchange took place, the Culture Secretary asked the watchdog Ofcom to rule on whether the phone hacking scandal should affect the BSkyB bid. Mr Michel has admitted that his repeated references to ‘JH’ in emails in fact referred to information obtained from his special adviser, and Government officials suggest he exaggerated his contacts to impress his bosses. Proof? The email which apparently proves Jeremy Hunt asked for advice from Murdoch's empire . In the email Mr Michel, News Corp’s head of public affairs for Europe, told Mrs Brooks that Mr Hunt ‘will be making references to phone hacking in his statement on Rubicon [the codename for the Sky bid] this week’. He said the Culture Secretary believed police were ‘pursuing things thoroughly and phone hacking has nothing to do with the media plurality issue’, a position Mr Michel described as ‘extremely helpful’. He claimed Mr Hunt wanted to widen the remit of a Parliamentary inquiry and ‘prevent a public enquiry’. ‘JH [Jeremy Hunt] is now starting to looking to phone-hacking/practices more thoroughly and has asked me to advise him privately in the coming weeks and guide his and No 10’s positioning,’ the email concluded. Tough day: Mrs Brooks leaves in a Black Range Rover after giving evidence to Leveson Inquiry . Three days later, on June 30, Mr Hunt told MPs that while the phone hacking allegations were ‘very serious’ they were ‘not material’ to his consideration of the BSkyB bid. Days later, however, the Guardian revealed that Milly Dowler’s voicemail messages had been targeted by the News of the World – a disclosure which led to News Corp dropping its bid for BSkyB, Mrs Brooks’s resignation and the Government setting up the Leveson inquiry, although the revelations have now been discredited. Downing Street has refused to refer the allegations against Mr Hunt to a sleaze watchdog which oversees the ministerial code until after he too has given evidence to Leveson. Mrs Brooks, giving evidence yesterday, said that after briefly discussing the BSkyB bid with Mr Cameron at a dinner in December 2010, she had a more substantial conversation with Mr Osborne at a restaurant that month. The following day she emailed Mr Michel saying that Mr Osborne had expressed ‘total bafflement’ at Ofcom’s latest response to the bid. Will he be seeing Rebekah?

Under pressure: BBC Director General George Entwistle admitted he knew nothing about the corporation broadcasting child sex abuse allegations before they went out . BBC insiders have called the Director General's claim that he didn't ask about the content of the canned Jimmy Savile Newsnight documentary 'barely credible' and 'ridiculous'. At a press conference on Friday, George Entwistle, who expressed his 'revulsion' at the thought of Savile's abuse at the BBC, claimed he never asked questions about the nature of the Newsnight investigation dropped last year, saying he wanted to ensure the independence of news and current affairs. At the time Mr Entwistle was Director of the Vision division, which is responsible for commissioning, producing, scheduling and broadcasting the content of all of the BBC's television channels. The Independent reported that media commentator Steve Hewlett, who presents Radio 4's The Media Show, yesterday called the claim 'simply implausible', adding: 'The idea that he didn't know is barely credible.' David Elstein, the former chief executive of Channel 5, added his voice to the condemnation, saying Entwhistle would have to be 'pretty brain dead' not to investigate the programme's subject matter. Mr Entwistle, who also apologised to victims on behalf of the BBC, told reporters that Helen Boaden (head of news) had told him that Newsnight was planning a programme about Savile. He said that he said 'thanks for letting me know', but asked no questions about it. A senior BBC newsroom source told the Independent: 'It defies credibility that he didn't try to find this out. 'The idea that, as head of vision, in charge of the Christmas schedule, he just said 'thanks for letting me know' is ridiculous. 'The best thing you can say is he looks completely incurious to the point of being irresponsible. He looks hopeless.' Tension: A source says BBC director general's comments have split the Newsnight newsroom . The source added that Newsnight journalists are 'extremely tense' and feel like they were left 'looking stupid' by Mr Entwhistle's comments. 'You have a huge national story that was not mentioned on Newsnight until 10 or 11 days after it blew up. (The newsroom) is getting uncomfortable. It is very tense. It is a ludicrous situation,' they added. The source also spoke about the claim of Peter Rippon, the editor who dropped the Savile investigation, that the story was not good enough to air. They added: 'He did everything he could to make it impossible for the story to run... In most newsrooms if you are not quite there (with a story) you would just keep going.' The paper added that it understands the Newsnight team had spoken to at least 10 women, including witnesses and victims. A BBC spokesperson said: 'George Entwistle has made his position exceptionally clear. As said at the press briefing on Friday, 'I was the Director of Vision for the television department at the BBC, I had no influence or authority over investigations carried out by BBC News and it's very important that I always behaved in a manner which absolutely bore out that lack of authority or responsibility'.' Sorry: Entwistle also apologised to victims on behalf of the BBC and says he feels 'revulsion' that the attacks may have taken place at the BBC .

Scotsman Neil Cunningham-Dobson, 55, was at the controls of the Remotely Operated Vehicle as the World War II cargo ship SS Gairsoppa and the World War I steamer SS Mantola were discovered in the North Atlantic last year. Both of the vessels - found 100 miles apart - were sunk by German U-Boats. Emotional wreck: Neil Cunningham-Dobson, 55, said all he could think of was his father's experiences at sea as he discovered the sunk World War II vessel SS Gairsoppa . Mr Cunningham-Dobson's employers Odyssey Marine Exploration will be able to keep 80 per cent of the silver once they have recovered it. He said as his team found the SS Gairsoppa last September, all he could think about was his father who served on a similar ship during WWII. The vessel had an estimated £150million worth of silver bullion on board while the SS Mantola has a haul thought to be worth £12million. Mr Cunningham-Dobson said today: 'When the wreck of the Gairsoppa came . into view for the first time, three miles down, I couldn't help but . think of my late father, Norman. 'He was a radio operator in World War . II. He served with the British-India Steam Navigation Company on ships . similar to the Gairsoppa. 'So for me it was like looking back at my father - a special moment.' Precious cargo: The SS Mantola, which was sunk by a German submarine in 1917 in the North Atlantic, carrying silver . Spooky sight: The Odyssey Marine Exploration's ROV inspection of the SS Mantola site, showing the promenade railings. There is a silver haul worth an estimated £150million on board . Weeks later the same company discovered the SS Mantola around 100 miles away that sank on February 9, 1917. Neil, who is Odyssey's chief marine archaeologist, will start the missions to recover the sunken treasure troves next month. He said the biggest challenge in . recovering the fortune is that it is at the bottom of the North Atlantic . - three times deeper than the watery grave of the Titanic. Doomed: The SS Gairsoppa, a steel-hulled British cargo steamship that was sunk by a German U-boat . Raised from the depths: A sonar image of the SS Gairsoppa on the bottom of the sea . Heroic: Second Officer Richard Ayres, the only survivor of the SS Gairsoppa . 'To extract the treasure you . are sending down specialised instruments a length equivalent to three . times that of the Tay Road Bridge, to accurately remove from a hold the . size of a back garden,' he said. The SS Mantola was insured to carry . silver worth £110,000 when it sailed in 1917. That value would mean the . ship could hold as much as 600,000 ounces of silver, based on silver . prices at the time. But the haul is small compared to . what is thought to be on board the SS Garisoppa - it sank in 1941 . carrying a reported cargo of up to 7 million ounces of silver. The Gairsoppa was steaming home from . India while in the service of the Ministry of War Transport when she was . torpedoed by a Nazi U-boat. She sank in icy seas more than three . miles deep about 300 miles south west of Ireland. Only one of her 84 . crew - Second Officer Richard Ayres - survived. The 412-ft steamship is sitting upright on the seabed, with its holds open. Odyssey said last September a robot . submersible captured video footage showing tea chests, a sign that the . heavier consignment of silver was underneath. The ship, recognisable by the . red-and-black paintwork of the British-India Steam Navigation Company . and the torpedo hole in its side, was sailing in a convoy from Calcutta . in 1941.

A lack of sleep can double the risk of  prostate cancer, a study has found. Researchers spent five years comparing the health of older men with their sleeping patterns. Study leader Dr Lara Sigurdardottir said: ‘Sleep problems are very common in modern society and can have adverse health consequences. ‘Women with sleep disruption have consistently been reported to be at an increased risk for breast cancer, but less is known about the potential role of sleep problems in prostate cancer.’ Her team studied more than 2,000 men aged between 67 and 96. They were asked whether they took sleeping pills, had trouble falling asleep, found it difficult to get back to sleep after waking in the night, or woke early and stayed awake. Among the participants, between 8.7 per cent and . 5.7 per cent reported severe and very severe sleep problems. None had prostate . cancer at the start of the study. Five years later, 6.4 per cent of the men were diagnosed with prostate cancer. Compared with those who had no problems sleeping, those with insomnia were significantly more likely to develop the disease. Insomnia can significantly increase the chance of men developing prostate cancer . The risk rose proportionately with the severity of sleep problems, increasing from 1.6 to 2.1 times the usual level. The researchers took steps to rule out . the possibility that sleep problems were caused by undiagnosed prostate . cancer or enlarged prostate glands, which can cause an urge to urinate . during the night. Why poor sleep can affect men's chances of developing the disease is unexplained. Dr Sigurdardottir added: 'Prostate . cancer is one of the leading public health concerns for men, and sleep . problems are quite common. If our results are confirmed with further . studies, sleep may become a potential target for intervention to reduce . the risk of prostate cancer.' The study, from the University of . Iceland in Reykjavik, was published in the American Association for . Cancer Research journal Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers and Prevention. Each year around 40,000 men in the UK are diagnosed with prostate cancer and 10,000 die from the disease.","Men with sleep problems more likely to develop prostate cancer .

Intelligence officers warned Tony Blair that Iraq had no significant weapons of mass destruction a year before he took Britain to war, it emerged yesterday. Secret evidence given to the Chilcot Inquiry into the conflict reveals the former Prime Minister was told in 2002 that Libya posed a far greater threat and was pursuing an active nuclear weapons programme. By contrast, one senior MI6 officer said it was clear 12 months before the war that Saddam Hussein had no nuclear weapons and no significant WMD at all. The unnamed officer said any actual WMD in Iraq would be ‘very, very small’ and would fit on ‘the back of a petrol lorry’. Mr Blair is said to have ‘understood’ that Libya was the real threat. On April 4, 2002, the day before Mr Blair flew to the United States for a pivotal weekend with George W Bush, he is said to have accepted that ‘it would not be sensible to lead the argument on Saddam and the WMD issue’. In the run-up to the 2003 war, Mr Blair claimed the intelligence on Iraq’s WMD programme was ‘extensive, detailed and authoritative’. But no weapons were ever found and the Chilcot Inquiry heard a great deal of testimony that raises doubts about what intelligence the West possessed on Saddam’s weapons. One MI6 officer said the danger from WMD was ‘all in the cranium of just a few scientists, who we never did meet and we have been unable to meet ever since’.

Monday also marked the day the first of three victims, Krystal Campbell, 29, was laid to rest. The other two victims, eight-year-old Martin Richard, and Boston University student Lingzi Lu, were also killed in the blasts. The president had traveled to the New England city on Thursday to attend and speak at an interfaith ceremony, where he spoke briefly on the victims and the scope of the tragedy. On Monday, survivors, residents and state officials were among the thousands gathered in silence across the Boston area. Bridget Horne, 28, who finished the marathon minutes before the explosions, spent the moment of silence locked in a group hug with other survivors in Back Bay, the neighborhood where the Boston Marathon finish line was.

It is part of the space agency's plan to reduce its exploration of other planets. But Nasa's former science chief is calling the plan 'irrational'. With limited money for science and an over-budget new space telescope, Nasa essentially had to make a choice in where it wanted to explore: the neighbouring planet or the far-off cosmos. Mars lost. Edward Weiler, who until September was Nasa's associate administrator for science, said: 'To me, it's totally irrational and unjustified,' 'We . are the only country on this planet that has the demonstrated ability . to land on another planet, namely Mars. It is a national prestige . issue.' Mars viewed from the Hubble Space Telescope. Cuts could mean this is the closest we get to the red planet in the future . Two scientists who were briefed on . the 2013 Nasa budget that will be released next week said the space . agency is eliminating two proposed joint missions with Europeans to . explore Mars in 2016 and 2018. Nasa had agreed to pay $1.4billion for those missions. Some Mars missions will continue, but the fate of future flights is unclear, including the much-sought flight to return rocks from the red planet. The two scientists said the cuts to the Mars missions are part of a proposed reduction of about $300million in Nasa's $1.5billion planetary science budget. More than $200million in those cuts are in the Mars programme, they said. The current Mars budget is $581.7million. Mr Weiler said he quit last year because he was tired of fighting to save Mars from the budget knife. He said he fought successfully to keep major cuts from Mars in the current budget but has no firsthand knowledge of the 2013 budget proposal. This image of the vast plains of the northern polar region of Mars was the first sent back from the Phoenix probe in 2008 . President Obama's dream of sending astronauts to Mars may now never come true . Just last week Dr Tom Pike, who fronted a study ruled out the possibility of life on Mars, said: 'Future NASA and ESA (European Space Agency) missions that are planned for Mars will have to dig deeper to search for evidence of life, which may still be taking refuge underground.' Those missions may now never go ahead. Mars 'has got public appeal, it's got scientific blessings from the National Academy', Mr Weiler said in a phone interview from Florida. 'Why would you go after it? And it fulfils the president's space policy to encourage more foreign collaboration.' Two years ago, President Barack Obama said his ultimate goal was to send astronauts to Mars. Images from Nasa's Mars Exploration Rover Opportunity beamed back last summer . Nasa spokesman David Weaver said that, just like the rest of the federal government, the space agency has to make 'tough choices ... and live within our means'. To do so, Mr Weaver said in an email: 'NASA is reassessing its current Mars exploration initiatives to maximise what can be achieved.' One of the big problems for Nasa's science budget is the replacement for the wildly successful Hubble Space Telescope. The James Webb Space Telescope, which would be about 100 times more powerful and would gaze farther into the universe than ever before, is now supposed to cost around $8billion. The original estimate was $3.5billion. The other big part of Nasa science spending - Earth sciences - is not being cut, the two scientists said.

UPDATED: . 09:25 EST, 24 December 2012 . iPads and Kindles are said to be more in demand than traditional children's toys such as Mattel's Barbie dolls . The toys have been well and truly thrown out of the pram this year as children's Christmas lists are dominated by iPads and Kindles, analysts said. Top toymakers Mattel and Hasbro are said to be 'terrified' at the thought that children no longer plump for traditional presents such as dolls and toy cars, but rather the latest technological gadgets, including iPads and Kindles. 'Up against tech groups that make such engaging entertainment, toymakers cannot compete', said managing director of equity research at Needham & Company, an investment banking firm. The report in the Financial Times this morning said that although toy companies had seem the trend coming they had struggled to adapt. Some analysts are said to be lowering predictions for end-of-year toy sales, estimated at $1.41bn for Hasbro and $3.29 for Mattel, after sales to date for the year are down on last year. In April Mattel reported that its first-quarter profit dropped 53 percent, pulled down by costs tied to an acquisition and lower sales for Barbie and Hot Wheels. The problem faced by toymakers is that children as young as three are taking more of an interest in the latest gadgets and therefore spending less time with toys. The interest is fuelled by the likelihood that many can expect to get their hands on their parents' older iPad and Kindle models as they upgrade this Christmas. As their parents look to upgrade to the next iPad or Kindle this year, their children are expected to benefit from the hand . Mattel faced financial difficulty in the 1980s when it attempted to move into the video games market, while Hasbro, the maker of Monopoly and Scrabble have suffered fierce competition from the social gaming company Zynga, built of Facebook. John Frascotti, chief marketing officer for Hasbro, said: 'Clearly young people have an aptitude for and expectation with digital platforms that we need to recognise.' But it wasn't all bad news for Hasbro. The Furby, a cuddly electronic owl, has made a startling comeback. It sold 40million across the world at . the height of its popularity in the 1990s and the new version, with LCD eyes and costing £59.99, . now has LCD eyes has sold 20 per cent above expectations. A Hasbro spokesman said: 'The response to the new innovation on Furby has been terrific in marketsaround the world. 'In the UK, we not only delivered 20 per cent more product than we had initially planned, but we also flew some additional Furbys into the country to try and meet demand. We are ramping up production.' The Toy . Retailers Association refuted the claim that traditional presents are in decline, and said that toys popular in the 1980s are on this year's list of 'must-have' presents. Cabbage Patch Kids sold in their . millions after they were first launched in 1983. The dolls, which cost . £29.99, are supposedly found in vegetable patches and adopted by . children. Twister, the classic game which was . hugely popular in the 1970s and 80s, is expected to sell well this year . too, in a modern form called Twister Dance and priced at £26.99. Analysts predict children as young as three will be unwrapping gadgets such as the Apple iPad tablet (left) and the Amazon Kindle Fire HD (right) at trendsetting rates this Christmas . There are also two Lego sets on the list, one of which, called Olivia's House, is aimed specifically at girls. It costs £69.99. Frederique Tutt, an industry analyst, . said: 'There are a lot of toys that have re-launched this year as they . have a long lifespan and are nostalgic to parents.' But the list, compiled by the Toy . Retailers Association, isn't entirely nostalgic. It also includes two . hi-tech children's tablets. Mattel was unavailable for comment. 1.

Summer ice is melting 10 times faster in the Antarctic than it was 600 years ago, with the most rapid melt occurring in the past 50 years. Researchers from the Australian National University and the British Antarctic Survey also discovered the ice melt is at its highest level in 1,000 years. 'It's definitely evidence that the climate and the environment is changing in this part of Antarctica,' lead researcher Nerilie Abram said. A one-metre long section of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet Divide core, with a dark layer of volcanic ash visible. The teams drilled a 364-metre (1,194 feet) long ice core from James Ross Island in the continent's north to measure past temperatures in the area . Abram and her team drilled a 364-metre (1,194 . feet) deep ice core on James Ross Island, near the northern tip of the Antarctic Peninsula, to measure historical temperatures and compare them with summer ice melt levels in the area. Visible layers in the ice core show periods when summer snow on the ice cap thawed and then refroze. They found that, while the temperatures have gradually increased by 1.6 degrees Celsius (2.9 degrees Fahrenheit) over 600 years, the rate of ice melting has been most intense over the past 50 years. Experts said the stronger ice melts are likely to be responsible for faster glacier ice loss and some of the dramatic collapses from the Antarctic ice shelf over the past 50 years . Scientists at the British Antarctic Survey have produced the most detailed map yet of Antarctica¿s landmass, showing a landscape of mountain ranges and plains cut by gorges and valleys much deeper than previously seen . That shows the ice melt can increase dramatically in climate terms once temperatures hit a tipping point. This is the first time it has been . demonstrated that levels of ice melt on the Antarctic Peninsula have . been particularly sensitive to increasing temperature during the 20th . Century. Scientists at the British Antarctic Survey have produced the most detailed map yet of Antarctica’s landmass. Bedmap2 shows a landscape of mountain ranges and plains cut by gorges and valleys much deeper than previously seen. In addition, the map allows scientists to analyse, in much greater detail, the bed below the Antarctic ice sheet. The map reveals the volume of ice in Antarctica is 4.6 per cent greater than previously thought and that the the mean bed depth at 95 metres, is 60 metres lower than estimated. The volume of ice that is grounded with a bed below sea level is also 23 per cent greater than originally thought meaning there is a larger volume of ice that is susceptible to rapid melting. It also reveals the ice that rests just below sea level is vulnerable to warming from ocean currents. The new deepest point, under Byrd Glacier, is around 400 metres deeper than the previously identified deepest point. 'Once . your climate is at that level where it is starting to go above zero . degrees, the amount of melt that will happen is very sensitive to any . further increase in temperature you may have,' Abram said. Robert Mulvaney, from the British Antarctic Survey, said the stronger ice melts are likely responsible for faster glacier ice loss and some of the dramatic collapses from the Antarctic ice shelf over the past 50 years. Their research was published in the Nature Geoscience journal. In other parts of Antarctica, such as the West Antarctic Ice Sheet, the picture is more complex and it is not yet clear that the levels of recent ice melt and glacier loss are exceptional or caused by human-driven climate changes. Dr Abram concludes: 'This new ice core record shows that even small changes in temperature can result in large increases in the amount of melting in places where summer temperatures are near to 0°C, such as along the Antarctic Peninsula, and this has import' This research was funded by the Natural Environment Research Council. Dr Abram is an Australian Research Council Queen Elizabeth II Fellow.","Experts found the most rapid melt occurred in the past 50 years .

Scientists analysing how magicians Penn & Teller perform one of the oldest known illusions now reveal that some aspects of the magic trick are even more effective at manipulating audiences than the magicians predicted. These findings not only shed light on basic processes such as cognition, but could help advance the art of magic, researchers suggested. In recent years, neuroscientists have increasingly been analysing magicians' performances to gain insights on the human mind. Raymond Teller of the illusionist duo Penn & Teller performs the cup and ball trick: Scientists have revealed that some aspects of the trick are even more effective at manipulating audiences than magicians predicted . 'We realized that magicians were among the best people at manipulating attention and awareness, far better than scientists,' said cognitive neuroscientist Stephen Macknik, director of the laboratory of behavioural neurobiology at the Barrow Neurological Institute in Phoenix, Arizona. 'So we've been poaching their techniques, bringing them back to the labs to increase our rate of discovery.' The latest magic trick Macknik and his colleagues investigated is the classic cups and balls illusion. Examples ascribed to ancient Roman conjurers date back to 3BC, and some claim it goes back further to ancient Egypt. The illusion nowadays commonly involves three upside-down cups and three balls, Magicians can make the balls seemingly jump from cup to cup, disappear from one cup and appear in another, turn into other items and so on. (The modern swindler's version is the shell game.) To learn more about this illusion, the researchers enlisted the aid of the famous duo Penn & Teller. Seven volunteers watched 10-12-second-long video clips of Teller performing the illusion in front of a NOVA scienceNOW TV crew at the duo's theatre in Las Vegas. The balls in the illusion are typically brightly coloured, while the cups are usually opaque. Penn & Teller practice a version with three opaque and then three transparent cups. Classic illusion: In the cup and ball trick, magicians can make the balls seemingly jump from cup to cup, disappear from one cup and appear in another, turn into other items and so on . 'It's a great act, and the trick still works even with transparent cups, because they're just that good —  people still can't follow all the movements and see how the trick is done,' Macknik said. 'I've seen them do this trick for more than 20 years,' said vision scientist Flip Phillips at Skidmore College, in Saratoga Springs, N.Y. 'The best part of the whole routine is that, despite the fact that they are telling you what they are doing — they're showing you what they're doing — you're still amazed because you just can't fight the deception.' Teller devised this variation while fiddling with an empty water glass and wadded-up paper napkins for balls at a Midwestern diner. He turned the glass upside down and put a paper ball on top, then tilted the glass so that the ball fell into his other hand. The falling ball was so compelling that it drew his own attention away from his other hand, which was deftly and secretly loading a second ball under the glass. Teller found that the sleight happened so quickly he himself did not realise he had loaded the cup. He surmised he missed it because the falling ball captured his attention. In the experiments, the volunteers reported when they saw balls get removed from, or placed under, cups by pressing buttons. The researchers also used cameras pointed at the eyes of the volunteers to track their gazes. The researchers found that while the falling ball did draw audience attention, other aspects of the trick were actually stronger at making the illusion work. For instance, audiences were fooled more often when the magician attempted to drop a ball that was stuck to a cup. 'A lot of times the intuitions we have about the way things work aren't the way things work,' said Phillips, who did not take part in this research. 'This isn't to put down Teller — Teller's intuition is good. There is research we did on a famous sleight of hand known as the French drop where Teller's intuition on how to sell the trick is perfectly correct.' Misdirection: In the experiments, the volunteers reported when they saw balls get removed from, or placed under, cups by pressing buttons. The researchers also used cameras to track the gazes of the volunteers . In addition, magicians often say that success with illusions depends on how well they can use gazes and faces to manipulate where audiences look, Macknik explained. The researchers tested this idea by hiding Teller's face on the video clips with a black rectangle, and found doing so apparently did not affect the illusion. 'We're showing a discovery that magicians missed because they relied on their intuition, and their intuition was wrong,' Macknik said. These findings support recent studies, including one from Macknik and his colleagues, which hinted that the facial expressions and other social cues magicians think are crucial to illusions may not actually be essential. 'A huge amount of training in magic is that social cues matter,' Macknik said. 'We're starting to wonder if social cues help with any magic tricks. Future research is warranted to look at the effects of social cues in illusions … we'd like to see an effect where they really matter.' These new findings shed light on how and by how much people can be misdirected, which could help magicians improve their art. Macknik and his colleagues Hector Rieiro and Susana Martinez-Conde detailed their findings online Feb. 12 in the inaugural issue of the journal PeerJ. Watch Video Short: Magic and Autism on PBS.

Syrian Ambassador to Lebanon, Ali Abdul-Karim Ali, says Damascus has 'the option and the surprise to retaliate'. He said he cannot predict when the retaliation will be, saying it is up to relevant authorities to prepare for it. In Iran, the semi-official Fars news agency quoted Deputy Foreign Minister Hossein Amir Abdollahian today as saying the raid on Syria will have significant implications for the Israeli city of Tel Aviv. Strike: U.S. officials say Israeli jets have destroyed a convoy of Russian-made anti-aircraft weapons in Syria. File picture . U.S. officials said Israel launched a . rare airstrike inside Syria yesterday, targeting a convoy believed to . contain anti-aircraft weapons bound for Hezbollah. The Syrian military denied the existence of any such shipment and said a scientific research facility outside Damascus was hit. The attack adds a potentially flammable new element to tensions already heightened by Syria's civil war. It . was the latest salvo in Israel's long-running effort to disrupt the . Shiite militia's quest to build an arsenal capable of defending against . Israel's air force and spreading destruction inside the Jewish state. Regional . security officials said the strike, which occurred overnight Tuesday, . targeted a site near the Lebanese border, while a Syrian army statement . said it destroyed a military research center northwest of the capital, . Damascus. They appeared to be referring to the same incident. A Russian SA-17. It is described as a 'game-changer' that could shoot down Israel's air forces . U.S. officials said the target was a . truck convoy that Israel believed was carrying sophisticated . anti-aircraft weapons bound for Hezbollah in Lebanon. They spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorised to speak about the operation. Regional . officials said the shipment included sophisticated Russian-made SA-17 . anti-aircraft missiles, which if acquired by Hezbollah would be . 'game-changing', enabling the militants to shoot down Israeli jets, . helicopters and surveillance drones. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to brief the media. In . a statement, the Syrian military denied the existence of any such . shipment and said a scientific research facility outside Damascus was . hit by the Israeli warplanes. Anger: Both Syria and Russia condemned the airstrike. Syrian media called it a 'terrorist attack' The Israeli military declined to comment. However, many in Israel worry that as Syrian President Bashar Assad loses power, he could strike back by transferring chemical or advanced weapons to Hezbollah, which is neighboring Lebanon's most powerful military force and is committed to Israel's destruction. Russia has expressed concern at an alleged Israeli attack on Syria, saying such a strike would be an unacceptable violation of the UN Charter. Russia has steadfastly refused to denounce Syrian President Bashar al-Assad during the 22-month conflict that has killed more than 60,000 people. The Russian Foreign Ministry said: 'If this information is confirmed, then we are dealing with unprovoked attacks on targets on the territory of a sovereign country, which blatantly violates the UN Charter and is unacceptable, no matter the motives to justify it.' Fear: A Free Syrian Army fighter drags his comrade who was shot by sniper fire during heavy fighting in the Ain Tarma neighbourhood of Damascus yesterday . The fighter on the right died soon after being shot. He joins an estimated 60,000 who have lost their lives during the Syrian civil war . The airstrike follows decades of enmity between Israel and allies Syria and Hezbollah, which consider the Jewish state their mortal enemy. The situation has been further complicated by the civil war raging in Syria between the Assad regime and rebel brigades seeking his ouster. The war has sapped Assad's power and threatens to deprive Hezbollah of a key supporter, in addition to its land corridor to Iran. The two countries provide Hezbollah with the bulk of its funding and arms. A Syrian military statement read aloud on state TV Wednesday said low-flying Israeli jets crossed into Syria over the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights and bombed a military research center in the area of Jamraya, northwest of Damascus. The strike destroyed the center and damaged a nearby building, killing two workers and wounding five others, the statement said. The military denied the existence of any convoy bound for Lebanon, saying the center was responsible for 'raising the level of resistance and self-defense' of Syria's military. Damascus has seen some of the heaviest fighting of the war. Rebels are fighting to oust the Bashad regime . Russia has refused to condemn the actions of government forces led by Bashar al-Assad . 'This proves that Israel is the instigator, beneficiary and sometimes executor of the terrorist acts targeting Syria and its people,' the statement said. Israel and Hezbollah fought an inconclusive 34-day war in 2006 that left 1,200 Lebanese and 160 Israelis dead. While the border has been largely quiet since, the struggle has taken other forms. Hezbollah has accused Israel of assassinating a top commander, and Israel blamed Hezbollah and Iran for a July 2012 attack on Israeli tourists in Bulgaria. In October, Hezbollah launched an Iranian-made reconnaissance drone over Israel, using the incident to brag about its expanding capabilities. Israeli officials believe that Hezbollah's arsenal has markedly improved since 2006, now boasting tens of thousands of rockets and missiles and the ability to strike almost anywhere inside Israel. Israel suspects that Damascus obtained a battery of SA-17s from Russia after an alleged Israeli airstrike in 2007 that destroyed an unfinished Syrian nuclear reactor. Carnage: Buildings damaged by what activists said were missiles fired by a Syrian Air Force fighter jet loyal to President Bashar al-Assad earlier this month . Earlier this week, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warned of the dangers of Syria's 'deadly weapons,' saying the country is 'increasingly coming apart.' The same day, Israel moved a battery of its new 'Iron Dome' rocket defense system to the northern city of Haifa, which was battered by Hezbollah rocket fire in the 2006 war. The Israeli army called that move 'routine'. Syria, however, cast the airstrike in a different light, linked to the country's civil war, which it blames on terrorists carrying out an international conspiracy. Despite its icy relations with Assad, Israel has remained on the sidelines of efforts to topple him, while keeping up defenses against possible attacks. Syrians gather around the bodies of civilians, who were executed and dumped in the Quweiq river in Aleppo yesterday. Syria's opposition charged that 'global inaction' was giving Bashar al-Assad's regime a license to kill . Israeli defense officials have carefully monitored Syria's chemical weapons, fearing Assad could deploy them or lose control of them to extremist fighters among the rebels. President Barack Obama has called the use of chemical weapons a 'red line' that if crossed could prompt direct U.S. intervention, though U.S. officials have said Syria's stockpiles still appear to be under government control. The strike was Israel's first inside Syria since September 2007, when warplanes destroyed a site that the U.N. nuclear watchdog deemed likely to be a nuclear reactor. Syria denied the claim, saying the building was a non-nuclear military site. A rebel fighter stands in front of a building after they took over the village of Aljanodiya following fighting against pro-Syrian regime forces, yesterday . Syria allowed international inspectors to visit the bombed site in 2008, but it has refused to allow nuclear inspectors new access. This has heightened suspicions that Syria has something to hide, along with its decision to level the destroyed structure and build on its site. In 2006, Israeli warplanes flew over Assad's palace in a show of force after Syrian-backed militants captured an Israeli soldier in the Gaza Strip. And in 2003, Israeli warplanes attacked a suspected militant training camp just north of the Syrian capital, in response to an Islamic Jihad suicide bombing in the city of Haifa that killed 21 Israelis. Syria vowed to retaliate for both attacks but never did. In Lebanon, which borders both Israel and Syria, the military and the U.N. agency tasked with monitoring the border with Israel said Israeli warplanes have sharply increased their activity in the past week. Israeli violations of Lebanese airspace are not uncommon, and it was unclear if the recent activity was related to the strike in Syria. Syria's primary conflict with Israel is over the Golan Heights, which Israeli occupied in the 1967 war. Syria demands the area back as part of any peace deal. Despite the hostility, Syria has kept the border quiet since the 1973 Mideast war and has never retaliated for Israeli attacks. In May 2011, only two months after the uprising against Assad started, hundreds of Palestinians overran the tightly controlled Syria-Israeli frontier in a move widely thought to have been facilitated by the Assad regime to divert the world's gaze from his growing troubles at home.","Iranian minister says Israel air strike will have implications for Tel Aviv .

CEO Jeffrey Skilling (pictured) will have his sentence reduced from 24 years to around 14 and 17.5 years . Convicted ex-Enron Corp. CEO Jeffrey Skilling's more than 24-year prison sentence for his role in the once mighty energy giant's collapse could be trimmed by as many as 10 years. The 59-year-old's sentence will be almost halved if a federal judge in Houston, Texas, approves an agreement reached today between prosecutors and defense attorneys. Justice Department spokesman Peter Carr . said the agreement will allow victims of Enron's collapse to finally . receive more than $40 million in restitution. Under the agreement, Skilling's original sentence will be reduced to somewhere between 14 and 17.5 years. The agreement still has to be approved by U.S. District Judge Sim Lake, who is set to hold a June 21 hearing in Houston to make the final decision on the length of Skilling's sentence. Daniel Petrocelli, Skilling's attorney, says the agreement 'brings certainty and finality to a long, painful process.' The ongoing status of the case has so far prevented the government from distributing Skilling's seized assets to victims, according to the agreement. Skilling's sentence already was set to be reduced. Skilling was convicted in 2006 on 19 counts of conspiracy, securities fraud, insider trading and lying to auditors for his role in the downfall of Houston-based Enron. The company collapsed into bankruptcy in 2001 under the weight of years of illicit business deals and accounting tricks. Skilling has been in prison since December 2006 and is serving his sentence in a low security facility outside Denver. Sentencing hearing: Former Enron CEO Jeffrey Skilling (center) walking with his attorney, Daniel Petrocelli (center left), to the federal courthouse for his hearing in 2006 in Houston, Texas . An appeals court in 2009 upheld his convictions but vacated his more than 24-year prison term and ordered that he be resentenced, saying a sentencing guideline was improperly applied, resulting in a longer prison term. The U.S. Supreme Court said in 2010 that one of his convictions was flawed when it sharply curtailed the use of the 'honest services' fraud law - a short addendum to the federal mail and wire fraud statute that makes it illegal to scheme to deprive investors of ""the intangible right to honest services.' The Supreme Court ruled that prosecutors can use the law only in cases where evidence shows the defendant accepted bribes or kickbacks and that because Skilling's misconduct entailed no such things, he did not conspire to commit honest-services fraud. Locked up: Skilling was convicted in 2006 on 19 counts of conspiracy, securities fraud, insider trading and lying to auditors . The Supreme Court told a lower court to decide whether Skilling deserved an entirely new trial. The lower court said no. Skilling, 59, was the highest-ranking executive to be punished for Enron's downfall. Enron founder Kenneth Lay's similar convictions were vacated after he died of heart disease less than two months after trial. Enron's collapse put more than 5,000 people out of work, wiped out more than $2 billion in employee pensions and rendered worthless $60 billion in Enron stock. Its aftershocks were felt across the city and the energy industry.","The agreement will allow victims of Enron's collapse to finally receive more than $40 million in restitution .

Five Jessops employees who posted an appeal for a new job in the window of their closed-down store have already been attracting attention from possible employers. The group of loyal workers have apparently been ordered to remove the window display - but within just three days, job offers were pouring in for the laid-off staff. One potential employer even offered to fly the group out to Spain to discuss the possibility of employing them. The workers at the Warrington branch of Jessops posted photographs of themselves with the message, 'Five unemployed and loyal staff seeking work. Can you help?' in the window of their store after the firm stopped trading on Friday. 'Devastating effect': Staff from the Warrington branch of Jessops plastered their photos in the window of the store in the hope of finding new employment . Lanza Martineta said he and his . fellow team-members - some of whom have worked for Jessops for up to 15 . years - wanted to show the 'real faces' behind yet another blow to the . British high street. And it did not take long for the . workers' inventive appeal to capture the public imagination - Mr . Martineta, 44, told MailOnline today that 'within hours there was a . response'. He added: 'This morning we've had someone ring us from Spain, to fly us over there and discuss an opportunity.' While emphasising that 'it's going to . take time' to get all the employees back into work, he expressed . confidence that the Warrington staff would find new jobs before long as a . result of the unconventional advertising. 'Loyal staff': Mr Martineta's picture beneath the sign featuring the staff's call for help . However, Mr Martineta warned that . many of the other 1,370 Jessops employees would find it harder to return . to the labour market, and urged the government to do more to support . struggling retailers. 'It's not me who's on the scrapheap,' he said. 'The personal battles have just started for each member of my store.' He continued: 'Why can't crippling . high street rents be subsidised by the government? When a store has to . find the best part of £92,000 before it makes a profit, that adds up. 'You can introduce all the measures you want, but once a company is making losses it's forever playing catch up. 'We have had literally hundreds of . people knocking on our door telling us how sorry we were that we were . going. We would like to say thank you for that - but what we really want . are jobs that replace the ones we have lost.' On Tuesday Jessops staff were seen taking down the employees' display from the shop window in Warrington. ITV Granada reported that the firm . had ordered that the display be removed a day after it sprang to . national attention after being featured on MailOnline. Around 1,370 shop staff were left jobless when Jessops closed its 187 stores across the UK last week. Further redundancies at the chain's head office in Leicester also look likely. Mr Martineta said their window display - which also includes a sign that reads: 'What's happening to our high streets?' - had created quite a stir in the town centre. 'It's brought quite a bit of attention,' said Mr Martineta, who said people had come in to sympathise with the team as they packed away stock and equipment inside the closed store. High street casualty: All 187 Jessops stores nationwide have ceased trading . The . team's collective enthusiasm for their work made the news of their fate . all the more devastating, according to Mr Martineta, who said staff . only learned of the chain's collapse when a journalist called the . Warrington branch for a comment. 'It . was really out of the blue,' he said. 'We had no warning. I've seen my . colleagues crying, wondering how they are going to pay their rents.' Mr Martineta, who in the meantime . intends to concentrate on his professional photographic work after . losing his position at Jessops, said this latest retail casualty . indicated a bleak future for the British high street. 'When Comet went down I did pay it . some attention, but it doesn't really hit you until it happens to you,' said Mr Martineta, adding that Jessops had struggled to compete with . internet retailers. 'People . were coming in for our expert advice, then using that to buy stock . online,' he said. 'I do think we could have adapted better. It is a . crying shame.' Final days: Customers browse in the Bath branch of Jessops on the day before stores across the country closed their doors . He also commented on the irony of HMV going into administration so soon after Jessops, saying that the local branch of the entertainment shop was 'literally a two-second walk'. The chief executive of HMV, Trevor Moore, was chief executive of Jessops until July last year. As Britain's only specialist camera retailer, Jessops had been a fixture on high streets nationwide for almost 80 years. Its collapse followed that of a number of familiar high street names over the course of last year, including fellow camera retailer Jacobs in June 2012, and Comet in November. Peacocks, La Senza and Clinton Cards also went under last year. Anyone who would like to get in touch . with Mr Martineta and the other former members of staff at Jessops .

Ordered to ‘fight to the last man and the last round’, they stuck to their guns as their comrades fell around them. For three days, the brave band of Desert Rats suffered relentless Panzer attacks and mounting casualties as they held the line in North Africa from Rommel’s advancing tanks. Their heroism during one of the bloodiest battles of the Second World War was later immortalised on canvas. Now the only surviving ‘Tommy’ depicted in the painting, 93-year-old Ray Ellis, has told of the ‘miracle’ that saved his life. In an emotional moment to be shown on BBC1's Antiques Roadshow tomorrow, former sergeant Ray Ellis points to the dramatic painting and says: 'I am that man. I fired the last round' 'The Battle of Knightsbridge, 6th June 1942' by war artist Terence Cuneo features the helmeted figure of Ray Ellis and his doomed friend . The helmeted gunner in the foreground of the artwork, he is shown fighting to the end as the bodies of his brothers in arms from the 426th Battery of the South Nottinghamshire Hussars lie all around. In an emotional moment to be shown on BBC1’s Antiques Roadshow tomorrow, the former sergeant points to the dramatic painting and says: ‘I am that man. I fired the last round.’ Describing the events of the last day of the battle on June 6, 1942, Mr Ellis told how he remained at his 25-pounder gun and witnessed the death of the shirtless comrade beside him. He said: ‘My regiment had been given the order to fight to the last man and the last round and not to retire, and this painting shows our position after a long day’s battle. ‘I fought in that battle. I am in fact that man there. And the reason I can say that is because the regiment was almost wiped out – but by some miracle, I was the last man virtually, and I fired the last round. ‘That round, which was at about six o’clock at night, hit a Mark IV tank. Then the man standing at the side of me was killed because a German tank had come up behind us and fired its machine gun, almost point blank. 'And I took a deep breath and waited for mine. For some reason the tank didn’t fire and I survived and am still here.’ Ray Ellis, pictured left on his wedding day with wife Irene in 1946, was also pictured in Mersa Matruh during the war, right. Remarkably, the photograph was found on the battlefield months after being blown up during the Battle of Knightsbridge and made its way back to Mr Ellis . Mr Ellis and his fellow gunners pictured in Palestine in 1940. From left, Clifford Smedley, Reg Leigh, Ray Ellis, Jim Radford and Jim Martin. Smedley died at the 1941 Siege of Tobruk, Leigh survived the war, Radford was also killed at Tobruk while Martin was killed at the Battle of Knightsbridge . Mr Ellis was among 90 men from his regiment who were captured at the ‘Battle of Knightsbridge’, ironically named – possibly by a homesick soldier – because it was a barren desert crossing. The rest of the regiment, which had already served in the nine-month Siege of Tobruk the year before, were killed. They had been ordered to delay the Germans at ‘Knightsbridge’ to protect the 8th Army as it withdrew. The picture was completed by celebrated war artist Terence Cuneo in 1978. Mr Ellis said: ‘When Cuneo was commissioned, he needed someone to tell him what it was all about, and I spent many hours with him describing the situation which he later painted.’ The painting now hangs proudly at the Queen’s Royal Lancers and Nottinghamshire Yeomanry Museum, near Newark. It was brought to the Antiques Roadshow when the BBC’s experts visited Newstead Abbey, Nottinghamshire, former home of poet Lord Byron. Mr Ellis turned up there to pay tribute to his dead comrades. The twice-widowed former headmaster, who lives in Hucknall, Nottinghamshire, has written a book of his wartime experiences, Once a Hussar, to be published next week. Ray Ellis turned up at the Antiques Roadshow at Newstead Abbey to pay tribute to his dead comrades . He said: ‘You feel guilty for having survived. I found my comrade Jim Hardy lying nearby. He had been cut in two. I took his water bottle and drank his water. I was in tears when I was taken prisoner.’ Mr Ellis was shipped from Libya to a prison camp in Italy. He escaped by marching out of the main gate as if on a work party and hid in the mountains for a year. A young girl discovered him and led him to a farming family who sheltered him. Mr Ellis named one of his daughters, Nerina, after her, and has returned regularly to the hill village of Massa Fermana, near Ancona, to visit the family who kept him alive. A remarkable story also surrounds the photograph showing Mr Ellis in the desert during the war. He said: ‘This photo of me at Mersa Matruh was blown up with my kit when my gun took a direct hit during the Battle of Knightsbridge. ‘It lay on the battlefield for many months until it was picked up  by members of the regiment who visited the site while advancing through Libya after the Battle of  El Alamein.’ On the Antiques Roadshow it is made clear the Cuneo painting is not for sale. Paintings by the artist, who died in 1996, regularly fetch £30,000 to £50,000 at auction.","Ray Ellis, 93, is the only surviving 'Tommy' depicted in the painting .

Flick through the TV channels on a Saturday morning, and it seems almost every one is showing a cooking show of some kind. However, finally there is one with a difference - it's hosted in space. Canadian astronaut Chris Hadfield today posted the first episode of his new show, called 'Chris Hadfield's Space Kitchen' - although the first recipe, a tortilla filled with honey and peanut butter, may not be to everyone's taste. Scroll down for video . First, get your ingredients: Chris Hadfield's latest video from the International space station reveals how astronauts create snacks in orbit. Here, he collects everything for a honey and peanut butter tortilla . Keep your eye on the prize: At one point Hadfield's torilla spins off screen and has to be retrieved, showing the issues of preparing food in zero gravity . 'In the early days of space exploration, food was mostly squeezed out of tubes,' said Hadfield in the video. 'But now, we have all kinds of things we eat on Earth.' However, he reveals there are some banned foods - including sandwiches. 'For sandwiches, we substituted bread for tortillas - here, crumbs just float away,' he explained. 'Our tortillas are packaged and last for 18 months.' Hadfield shows viewers how to make a tortilla filled with peanut butter and honey. He reveals that some items, such as honey jars, can be attached to surfaces using velcro to stop them floating away. However, others can also cause problems - as he demonstrates when a rogue tortilla floats away from him during the demonstration. Honey jars are attached using velcro to stop them floating away when not in use . Keeping utensils in check is accomplished using clips and velcro. Here, Hadfield reaches for his 'space scissors' to cut open a pack of peanut butter . During the demonstration he also reveals an interesting fact about honey on board. 'The bubbles stay in the middle of the bottle, as there's no gravity', he explains. He also reveals that when eating food such as peanut butter and honey, astronauts can easily get messy. However, as there is no running water on board, they have to use disposable wipes to clean themselves up after each meal. The video is the latest in a long line of online picture, messages and videos from Hadfield, who has been taking advantage of the station's internet connection to share his mission via Facebook and Twitter pages. He is expected to post more episodes of his fledgling space cookery show. Bread is banned on board because of the risk of wayward crumbs - so astronauts use tortillas instead . Instead of washing their hands, astronauts instead use specially packaged wipes on board, which are then thrown away .

Cameron wants a policy that allows UK to deport terror suspects before they start appeal procedure . Terror suspects could face a new system of being deported before they get the chance to hold a full appeal, David Cameron revealed yesterday. The Prime Minister said he was ‘fed up’ with the likes of hate-preacher Abu Qatada using a string of human rights appeals to remain in the UK. Mr Cameron went on: ‘That’s why I’m keen to move to a policy where we deport first, and suspects can appeal later.’ Under this new arrangement, deportees would only be able to appeal against the decision while still in this country - suspending their removal - if they faced ‘a real risk of serious, irreversible harm’. Currently, nobody can be put on a plane until all their appeals to British courts - and Strasbourg - have been exhausted. The proposals go further than ministers have ever previously suggested. But last night government officials were unable to provide further details of how the new regime would operate. It was also unclear whether it would apply only to suspected terrorists. Currently, there are 4,000 foreign rapists, muggers and other criminals walking the streets who the UK cannot kick out. New rules limited only to the extradition of terror suspects would fall far short of the demands made by Tory MPs for a wide-ranging overhaul of human rights law. There are also question marks over whether Mr Cameron’s idea would be acceptable to either the Liberal Democrats or, crucially, the European Court of Human Rights. Ministers would have to explain how, in the event of a terror suspect winning their appeal from overseas, they would be able to locate the terror suspect and bring them back to Britain. Abu Qatada has used a string of human rights appeals to remain in the UK at the taxpayer's expense . Theresa May wants to reduce 'the unacceptable delays' in the extradition process . Strasbourg has taken a hard-line on removing anybody to a country where torture or ill-treatment takes place. Qatada’s deportation to Jordan was blocked by Strasbourg on the grounds not that he would be harmed himself, but that some of the evidence used against him may have been obtained by torture. He is currently living in a £400,000 London house - paid for by the taxpayer - pending an appeal by Home Secretary Theresa May. Last night Tory MP Dominic Raab, who has campaigned to stop the abuse of human rights law by foreign criminals, said: ‘The Prime Minister is absolutely right to embrace fundamental deportation reform. ‘For it to work, we will need an Act of Parliament that lays down the law in clear terms, so ingenious judges with other agendas - at home and in Strasbourg - can’t subvert the common sense system the British public want put in place.’ In October last year, Home Secretary Theresa May said there was a need to reduce ‘the wholly unacceptable delays’ that have occurred in the extradition process for terror suspects. She said there was ‘scope for reforming rights of appeal, streamlining the stages, expediting cases through the court and looking again at the provision of legal aid for terrorist suspects’. Yesterday, Mr Cameron also voiced frustration with the pace of change on immigration reform, which he said was ‘just an issue where there is quite a profound disagreement between the Liberal Democrats and Conservatives’. The Prime Minister said it is ‘an issue of the absolute centre ground of British politics”","New proposals will mean deportees can only appeal while in UK .

Started five years ago after her parents invested 'several hundred thousand dollars, mostly in shoes', the now 20-year-old has decided to skip college in favour of moving into her own apartment to continue the blog. New season stilettos: The parents of 20-year-old Jane Aldridge admitted to spending $70,000 on her blog, mostly for shoes . When a reporter revealed that her parents estimate the investment in her blog 'runs several hundred thousand dollars,' neither Miss Aldridge nor her . mother Judy, denied it, admitting it was 'closer to $70,000'. However, after online fashion sites . began to highlight the expenses incurred her . parents, Miss Aldridge hit back yesterday calling the profile 'grossly exaggerated . and highly stylized' on Twitter. The . less-than-flattering profile was first published in the Texas Monthly, . where the blogger lives, and painted a picture of her daily life where . she documents her pricey designer shoe collection. The reporter, Jason Sheeler wrote about Miss Aldridge's reservations on attending college, and her mother's disdain for her younger daughter's affinity for shopping at sales. Both points have since garnered attention from various fashion sites. Mr Sheeler reported in the profile: '""Why should I go to college?” Jane asked me a few months ago, as . she grabbed a glass of champagne off a passing tray at a boutique party . we both attended. ""I’m already doing what I want.""' He continued: 'We pass by the discounter Nordstrom Rack (""Gross!"" says Judy. ""Carol made me go there one time, and I wanted to punch myself""). Sea of Shoes: Co-managed by her divorced parents, the blog features Miss Aldridge's vast luxury shoe collection, which gets over 400,000 hits per month . He also recounted a conversation in which Jane brought up her younger sister, Carole, referring to her budget-orientated choice of clothes, which was also singled out by other news sites. Mr Sheeler wrote: 'Jane smooths her half-tucked, sheer white blouse. I tell her I think it's a cool shirt. ""Really? I think it's, like, Splen-did,"" she says with a grimace, sounding out the mall brand with the horror of . someone being forced to say ""ointment."" He continued: 'She nicked the shirt from her . sister's closet; Carol, who is seventeen, is in her first year of . boarding school in Wales. ""I'm getting my hair dyed in a bit and, you . know, what if it messes up my shirt?""' Mr Sheeler's profile portrays a suburban teenage girl who has an 'intimidating infatuation' with designer footwear, whose blog Sea of Shoes has been featured in Teen Vogue, caught the attention of Karl Lagerfeld, and charges up-to $20,000 for event appearances. Mr Sheeler wrote she is now considered one of the top style bloggers in the country. Over a series of weeks, Mr Sheeler shadowed Miss Aldridge and her mother, who takes most of the photos on Sea of . Shoes, answers her daughter's email, handles press . requests, and negotiates her fashion event appearances. Like mother like daughter: Jane (left) and Judy (right) both run Sea of Shoes, the successful blog which documents designer shoes . He wrote a day-in-the-life-of profile, which recounts conversations as well as giving background to her now successful blog. The story starts with Aldridge 'snapping' at Mr Sheeler to stop touching a pair of her $750 glittery Miu Miu booties. 'Hello! I'm trying to shoot those. Can you put them down?' she says in a 'mean-girl tone'. Neither Miss Aldridge nor her mother contested the article or its contents in an interview on the national television programme Daybreak regarding the profile. However she took to her blog after NYMag.com recently published several quotes from the original text, which she called a 'snarky and out-of-context synopsis'. Perturbed at being portrayed in a negative light, Miss Aldridge also came forward to deny several of her original quotes published in the Texas Monthly. Specifically regarding her disinterest in college, as well as the $70,000 worth of expenses that are incurred for Sea of Shoes, Miss Aldridge wrote on her blog: 'I cannot believe the figures they threw out. Not one of them is even a little bit close to true.' She continued: 'There is a blatantly made up quote where I dismiss the notion of college.' Since she wrote what she called, her rebuttal, on her blog, hordes of fans have come forward on Twitter to defend her, writing 'don't listen to the haters' and 'keep your head up'. However, the Texas Monthly, a publication with a highly regarded reputation for accuracy, stands by the story and sent NYmag.com a statement. 'Both the writer and the fact-checker contacted Jane multiple times throughout the editing process to clarify details, and Judy Aldridge, as Jane’s spokesperson, confirmed figures, quotes, and biographical details with our fact-checker through several phone calls. '(Judy did contest the figure “several hundred thousand dollars” of investment in the blog given to the writer by Bryan Aldridge; when we could not contact him because he was out of the country, we chose to also include the number she provided, “closer to $70,000.”) 'We stand by the reporting in this story.

Vogue is branching out into the teenage market with the launch of Miss Vogue, aiming itself at the £7billion annual spending power of Britain's 7.5million teenagers. The 116-page magazine, which is out on Monday, features an £890 handbag in its fashion pages while designer labels DKNY, Coach and Michael by Michael Kors have also placed adverts inside. The back cover advert is for Dior Addict lip gloss, which costs £21 a tube, and a feature on work experience fashion features clothes totalling more than £1,000. The first edition of the fashion bible's younger sister stars 20-year-old model Cara Delevingne on its cover, who is praised by Vogue editor-in-chief Alexandra Shulman for her 'maverick sense of style and fun'. The first issue of Miss Vogue, which launched this week, has British model Cara Delevingne as its cover star . In her editor's letter, Ms Shulman writes: 'Targeted at younger readers specifically, its remit is the same: to inspire even if you're a bit short on cash.' Designer Henry Holland, 29, and socialite Pixie Geldof, 22, discuss fashion in one piece, Homeland actress Morgan Saylor is interviewed, while 17-year-old American fashion blogger Tavi Gevinson, editor of online magazine Rookie, writes about wearing crowns. Miss Vogue, which comes free with the June print and iPad issue of its sister publication, follows in the footsteps of Teen Vogue, which launched in the United States in 2003. Ms Shulman told Women's Wear Daily: 'I admire Teen Vogue and it certainly was an inspiration but I felt Miss Vogue needed a different feeling for the UK; It’s got a more British sensibility, I think, than Teen Vogue.' The magazine contains 35 pages of adverts, with advertisers stumping up £15,000 for a double page spread and £7,750 for a single page - 60 per cent less than the fee for Vogue itself, reports WWD. The back cover advert and inside cover pages - occupied by River Island and Topshop - cost an extra 10 per cent. Other high street advertisers include H&M, Miss Selfridge, Forever 21, and Accessorize. Twenty-year-old Cara Delevingne is seen in a halter top emblazoned with the magazine's name for its first issue . Miss Vogue was created by the . existing editorial team behind British Vogue, who are mainly in their . thirties, the Guardian reports. It was edited by Ms Shulman's deputy Emily Sheffield, the sister of Samantha Cameron. Publisher Stephen Quinn told WWD that 300,000 of British Vogue's 1.3million readership were aged between 15 to 24. 'We simply want a percentage of those to buy the magazine at UK newsstands,' he said. But Miss Vogue, part of the Conde Nast publishing empire, is unlikely to become a monthly magazine in its own right. 'We're doing to it to see if there is the reader and the interest out there,' Ms Shulman told the Guardian.
