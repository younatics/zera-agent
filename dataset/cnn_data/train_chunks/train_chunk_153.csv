"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Sophisticated submarine-like boats are the latest tool drug runners are using to bring cocaine north from Colombia, U.S. officials say. Semi-submersible boats used to smuggle drugs are gaining in quality, the Coast Guard says. Although the vessels were once viewed as a quirky sideshow in the drug war, they are becoming faster, more seaworthy, and capable of carrying bigger loads of drugs than earlier models, according to those charged with catching them. ""They tend to be one of a kind,"" U.S. Coast Guard Commandant Thad Allen said. ""They cost up to a million dollars to produce. Sometimes they are put together in pieces and then reassembled in other locations. They're very difficult to locate."" The boats are built in the Colombian jungle. They sail largely beneath the surface of the water but cannot submerge completely like a true submarine. But they are the latest escalation of a tactical race between smugglers and the U.S. Coast Guard. In the past three months the Coast Guard has learned of more semi-submersible vessels smuggling drugs than it did in the previous six years, when there were 23 cases, officials said.  Watch the Coast Guard chase down a semi-sub Â» . U.S. Coast Guard intelligence officers predict 85 cases this year and 120 next year. In some instances, the semi-subs are towed behind other vessels and are scuttled if they are detected, Allen said. Authorities are investigating reports that some semi-subs are unmanned and are operated remotely, he said. Diplomatic agreements give the U.S. Coast Guard drug-interdiction jurisdiction in partner countries' waters. Encounters have become so frequent -- and the dangers of boarding the vessels so pronounced -- that the Coast Guard is pushing for legislation that would make the use of ""unflagged"" semi-submersibles in international waters a crime punishable by up to 20 years in prison, even if authorities can't recover drug evidence because the smugglers scuttle the transports. ""There's really no legitimate use for a vessel like this,"" Allen said. An unflagged vessel is one not registered with a government. Allen believes the semi-subs are a response to the Coast Guard's tactic of using snipers in helicopters to shoot out engines on smugglers' speedboats. The submersibles' engines are beneath water level. ""We're seeing an evolution in the construction,"" he said. ""Early on we saw fiberglass and now we're seeing steel."" Early semi-subs were capable of carrying 4 or 5 metric tons of cargo; newer ones can carry 12 metric tons, Allen said. Their speed has increased to 12 knots, which is ""a pretty good speed on the ocean."" Despite the increase in the use of the semi-subs, Drug Enforcement Administration officials say most drugs still are transported by traditional methods -- fishing boats, speedboats and airplanes. But Frankie Shroyer, deputy chief of the DEA's Office of Enforcement Operations, called the use of semi-subs ""an emerging threat and we are attacking it through our investigations and working with the interagency community."" The DEA's main focus, however, ""is to dismantle entire organizations,"" he said. ""So we are looking at the organizations that are building these things. ... These are the same organizations that are using containers, the same organizations that are using airplanes, same organizations using go-fast boats."" Allen said the Coast Guard, the Department of Defense and others are working on how to board the vessels. ""In many cases, they don't stop. And it's difficult to slow them down,"" he said. The Coast Guard says drug runners also are resorting to putting refueling vessels far offshore so drug-carrying boats can avoid coastal areas, and even liquefying cocaine and concealing it in fuel. The semi-subs are ""another adaptation ... that we're going to have to adapt to ourselves,"" Allen said. Last year, the Coast Guard seized a record 355,000 pounds of cocaine worth an estimated $4.7 billion -- a 2 percent increase over 2006. The Coast Guard's largest cocaine bust ever came in 2007 -- 42,845 pounds stacked in large bundles on the deck of a freighter off the coast of Panama.

"(CNN) -- A salmonella outbreak linked to alfalfa sprouts has sickened some 94 people in 16 states and the District of Columbia, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported Tuesday. Health officials said those first cases became known November 1, with many getting ill after eating alfalfa sprouts in products from Jimmy John's Gourmet Sandwiches outlets. The Food and Drug Administration said Monday that those vegetables came from Tiny Greens Organic Farm. Tiny Green's alfalfa sprouts and spicy sprouts, which have alfalfa sprouts plus radish and clover sprouts, were distributed in 4-ounce and 5-pound containers to farmers' markets, grocery stores and restaurants including Jimmy John's. In addition to a variety of sprouts, the Urbana, Illinois, produce company distributes arugula, broccoli, fennel, cauliflower, onion, radish and other items, according to its website. The FDA said consumers shouldn't eat the sprouts and restaurants shouldn't serve them. They should instead be thrown away, the agency said. In a letter to Jimmy John's franchisees, founder Jimmy John Liautaud said that the chain had pulled sprouts from all its Illinois establishments after store locations came up negative for the bacteria. About 24% of those sickened in that outbreak were hospitalized, the CDC said. No deaths have been linked to the outbreak. The FDA said Monday that the sprouts were distributed in Indiana, Iowa, Missouri and possibly other Midwestern states, with roughly half the illnesses occurring in Illinois. Health officials had previously said the salmonella outbreak had sickened at least 89 people in 15 states and the District of Columbia. In an apparently unrelated situation, a Texas produce distributor has recalled nearly 7,000 cases of cilantro and curly parsley after samples in Quebec, Canada, and Michigan tested positive for salmonella, the company said Monday. The ""precautionary, voluntary recall"" pertains to cilantro and parsley from J&D Produce, Inc., packed between November 30 and December 6, the Edinburg, Texas-based company said in a statement. Cilantro and parsley processed and branded as Little Bear between those dates can be taken to retailers for a full refund. No one has reported getting sick from eating the vegetables, according to J&D Produce. The recall came after independent tests found salmonella on the company's parsley in Quebec and its cilantro in Detroit, Michigan, both of which came from the same processing line in Texas. The company's products are sold retail as well as to wholesalers, who may then distribute them to restaurants and other establishments, according to Sharon McNerney, a public relations consultant for the company. The recall involves 2,498 cases of the parsley -- which have expiration dates 12 days after being packed -- that went out to the Canadian provinces of Quebec and Ontario and the U.S. states of Connecticut, Massachusetts, Michigan, Missouri, New  Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Texas, Washington and Wisconsin. The 4,411 recalled cases of cilantro, carrying the same packing and expiration dates, were distributed in Colorado, Illinois, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Texas, Washington and Wisconsin as well as Quebec and Ontario . After the positive results, regulators and health officials in the United States and Canada have stepped up inspections of J&D Produce's facilities, the company's president, James Bassetti, said. They also undertook other measures, including  stopping and sanitizing all production lines, adding manual inspections, rinsing products more and bringing in consultants. ""We have a good track record, but we'll bring our expectations and standards to even higher levels,"" he said. ""We've already begun improving our systems."" In addition to cilantro and parsley, the Texas company gathers, packs and distributes a variety of fruits and vegetables such as carrots, limes, eggplants, peppers, greens, onions, melons, mangos and asparagus, according to its website. Salmonella is a bacterial infection that usually lasts four to seven days. About 40,000 cases of salmonellosis are reported each year in the United States, according to the CDC. Those who get it typically develop fever, abdominal cramps and diarrhea between 12 and 72 hours after becoming infected. Most people recover on their own, without needing significant treatment. But salmonella in very young and very old people, as well as those with weakened immune systems, can lead to severe illness and even death. The CDC recommends that anyone suspecting he or she may be ill from eating contaminated food should talk to a doctor.","The FDA calls Tiny Greens Organic Farm a source of the outbreak .

"(CNN) -- Rescuers towing a giant disabled freighter in frigid Alaskan waters were attempting to avoid bad weather on Sunday, a move that will delay its arrival in Dutch Harbor, Alaska, the Coast Guard said. The Tor Viking II vessel, towing the Golden Seas freighter, had ""moved south a little bit"" to avoid 20-foot seas and 30-knot winds, Coast Guard Chief Petty Officer Dana Warr said. The Tor Viking II's captain made the decision to loop below the Aleutian Islands, he said. The freighter is not expected to arrive in Dutch Harbor until Tuesday afternoon, he said Sunday. The 738-foot Golden Seas suffered engine problems Friday morning and was chugging along at only 3 knots (3.5 mph). On Saturday night, the Tor Viking II vessel reached the Golden Seas and began towing it toward Dutch Harbor, a journey of about 275 miles, Warr said. ""Right now, everything is going as planned,"" Warr said, adding that authorities will remain vigilant until the freighter reaches Dutch Harbor. The U.S. Coast Guard cutter Alex Haley was expected to meet the two vessels on Sunday morning, according to the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation. Warr said Sunday the cutter was ""just around the corner"" and able to assist should the tow line break -- the worst-case scenario, he said. In addition, the Coast Guard can fly out in helicopters to reconnect the tow, he said. ""We have plan B in place in case something happens,"" he said. ""The safety of the crew is paramount. At the current time they are not in any danger,"" Jeremy Michels, responsible party incident commander, said in a teleconference Saturday. The tow operation took about three hours to set up, Warr said Sunday. The Golden Seas is carrying canola seed used for making canola oil as well as more than 450,000 gallons of crude oil, 11,700 gallons of diesel and 10,000 gallons of lube oil on board, officials said. The vessel, owned by the Greek company Allseas Marine, was traveling from Vancouver, British Columbia, to the United Arab Emirates. The towing operation will be challenging because of high seas, including waves of up to 26 feet, officials have said. The Golden Seas encountered waves as high as 29 feet on Friday, the Coast Guard said. Helicopters aided the effort to keep the freighter from drifting southeast and running aground on Atka Island, part of the Aleutian Islands in the Bering Sea, before the tow was connected. Gary Folley of the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation said the state and Coast Guard are conducting a risk assessment of rescue operations in the region. The study will include a look at possible funding to add more rescue tugs on the islands.

"Madrid (CNN) -- Early editions of Spain's leading newspaper Thursday displayed a large front-page photo claiming to be an ""unprecedented"" and ""exclusive"" look at Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez's medical treatment in Cuba. But the intubated man lying in a hospital bed shown in the photo wasn't Chavez, the newspaper soon discovered, and it began backtracking. El Pais took down the photo, which was on the newspaper's website for about 30 minutes, and also recalled the early editions of its newspaper from newsstands. ""After learning that the image offered did not correspond to Chavez, El Pais also stopped distributing the print edition and started to send a new edition to retail outlets,"" the newspaper said in a statement on its website, explaining the retraction and apologizing to readers. Venezuelan VP accuses 'infiltrators' of murder plot against him . El Pais declined to comment on the matter to CNN. The newspaper's online statement said the photo had been provided by an agency that claimed it was an authentic image of Chavez. ""The daily has opened an investigation to determine the circumstances of what happened and the errors that could have been committed in the verification of the photo,"" the statement said. Several purported photos of the Venezuelan leader have circulated on social media in recent weeks, but Venezuela's government hasn't released any new photos of Chavez since he underwent cancer surgery in Cuba more than six weeks ago. The 58-year-old president hasn't made any public appearances since then, either. The quick retraction by El Pais did not quell sharp criticism from the Venezuelan government and many on social media, who slammed the newspaper and said the photo was clearly taken from a 2008 YouTube video that had nothing to do with Chavez. Chavez ally: Ailing president undergoing physical therapy . ""As grotesque as it is false, the photo of 'Chavez intubated' that today the venerable Spanish newspaper El Pais published on its front page,"" Venezuelan Information Minister Ernesto Villegas said in a Twitter post. Later Thursday, Villegas said the Venezuelan government plans to pursue legal action against the newspaper ""so that these type of acts do not go unpunished."" ""We will use all the legal tools within our reach to proceed to repair the damage caused not only to Comandante Chavez, the president, but also to all of Venezuelan society,"" he said. The photo's publication, Villegas said, was evidence of a right-wing media campaign that aims to spread fear and destabilize Venezuela. He also objected to the nature of the image, arguing that the newspaper's editors never would have permitted the publication of a similar photo of a European president or a member of their own families. Diosdado Cabello, head of Venezuela's National Assembly, said publishing the photo was no accident. ""Nobody believes that the photo that appears in El Pais of Spain is something accidental,"" he wrote in a Twitter post, arguing that the motive behind the photo's publication was clear: ""hatred."" Argentinian President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner also took to Twitter to criticize the Spanish newspaper, calling the photo a ""dirty trick."" Pilar Minguez was getting ready to open a bundle of newspapers as she set up her newsstand in Madrid early Thursday when she got word of the problem. ""Don't open it. I have to take the newspapers,"" Minguez said a distributor told her. ""There was a problem, and they have to change the front page."" Nothing like that has ever happened before, particularly with the prominent El Pais, Minguez said. ""It's unbelievable, because with the number of filters it goes through, it is a little strange, truly,"" Minguez said. The newspaper provided additional details into its decision-making in an article posted online Thursday night, titled, ""The photo that El Pais never should have published."" ""The newspaper will revise its verification procedures in view of the errors committed,"" the article said. But the El Pais article also said that after being assured by a news agency that the photo was authentic and taken by a Cuban nurse who had been part of Chavez's medical team, El Pais had no way to confirm details about when the picture was taken ""due to the information restrictions under the Cuban regime."" There was a lengthy debate among the paper's editors about whether to publish the hospital photo, the newspaper said. ""The conclusion reached was that the image was relevant at a time when the health of Venezuelan president is a source of great controversy and heated political debate in his country, because of his absence during his inauguration and ... in light of the lack of transparency of the authorities,"" El Pais said.

"MONTREAL, Quebec (CNN) -- Given Montreal's proximity to substantially-sized American cities -- it's just over five hours driving from Boston, Massachusetts and Hartford, Connecticut -- you might not think Quebec's largest city would be so different than these New England metropolises. Old Montreal, seen from a pier at the port, has quaint narrow streets with a slew of restaurants and shops. But in architecture, language, cuisine and culture, Montreal clearly distinguishes itself as a bustling French-flavored center with a modern Canadian accent. Montreal's convenient subway system and concentrated points of interest also make it a great choice for anyone who doesn't have a lot of time to spend away from home. I had the opportunity to visit Montreal for a mere 48 hours earlier this month and found it enough time to experience some of the best of the city. Old Montreal . From the look of the shops and the line to see the cathedral in the historic part of the city, it seems Old Montreal gives most of itself to tourists. Still, for the beautiful old-world buildings and expansive port, it's a must-see. For a break, try one of the ice cream shops or cafes that line the street along the river. If you're tired of walking, you can rent a Segway on the Clock Tower Pier and even take a Segway tour of the area. But I think it's worth it to stroll the pier and watch people with their toy sailboats near the clock tower. There are also kiosks selling various knickknacks on the pier near the science museum.  See more photos of Montreal Â» . For those looking for impressive old buildings, take some time to experience the Notre-Dame Basilica (110 rue Notre-Dame Ouest), inaugurated in 1829. The church's style is Gothic Revival, and its chapel's interior was inspired by the Sainte-Chapelle in Paris, France. There is also the grand Hotel de Ville, which is Montreal's City Hall. The charming narrow streets of the old city light up beautifully in the evening, so be sure to stop back after dinner. Museums . Montreal has a slew of museums that cater to many interests. But if you're only going to spend a couple days there, it's best to pick just one.  For art lovers, there's the Museum of Contemporary Art (185, Sainte-Catherine Ouest) and the Museum of Fine Arts (1379 Sherbrooke Ouest).   I went to the Museum of Fine Arts, where a gorgeous array of clothing by Yves Saint Laurent is on display until September 28. Don't miss the room of dresses inspired by famous paintings. The designer turned Van Gogh's sunflowers into shimmering sequins, and used white tulle to create the softness of Renoir's brush strokes. The museum also has collections of ancient artifacts like Greek vases and Egyptian mummies. History buffs can check out the Museum of Archaeology and History. There is also an environment-themed museum inside the Biosphere, the world's largest geodesic dome, which was part of Expo '67. If none of the above appeals to you, visit the Montreal Science Centre, currently showing an exhibition called ""The Science of Aliens."" If you have time, you can even see an IMAX journey on the Colorado River and the Grand Canyon -- I personally skipped this, since it didn't seem particularly Quebecois. Nature . Forming a picturesque green mound in the background of the city, Mont Royal offers spectacular views of Montreal from above. Visitors can drive up around the park to the lookout point, or walk on foot to admire the trees leading up to the top. This seems like a great place for a picnic if time weren't an issue. McGill University and beyond . I am a sucker for pretty college campuses, so I found special pleasure in walking around McGill University behind the main gate on Rue Sherbrooke. The path through the downtown campus leads up to the Arts Building, the oldest building on campus. The university also has a science museum of its own, which serves as a research institution in evolution. If you plan ahead, you can even take a guided historical tour of the campus by contacting the university a week in advance.   Climbing up the hill behind the main building, I came to a fairytale-like castle, complete with turrets and Gothic stone, situated on the slope of Mont Royal. Then I read the sign: Royal Victoria Hospital (687 Pine Avenue Ouest). Huh! There is something strangely comforting about knowing that, if you get seriously ill, you'd have a room in a place that looks like it's for royalty. Shopping . You can easily satisfy all souvenir needs in Old Montreal. But for more SoHo-style clothes shopping, check out the boutiques on Rue Crescent. Rue St. Denis also has a reputation for trendiness, and the main street, Ste. Catherine, has a slew of shops for clothes, books, music, and more, and is home to the department store Ogilvy (1307 rue Sainte-Catherine Ouest).   Beneath all of this, Montreal has a unique system called the Underground City, passages of shops that connect multilevel-malls and other attractions so you never have to feel a raindrop on a gloomy day. Again, pick and choose wisely according to your interests and time constraints. Nightlife . Rue Crescent is alive at night with bars and clubs, but don't miss Montreal's outdoor music festivals and events in the open air. I was there for Les FrancoFolies, a celebration of French music that drew thousands of people to stages set up around the center of the city.   The famous Club Soda hosts concerts of all kinds, with big names like the Dandy Warhols (September 14) and Quebec-based groups like The Lost Fingers (September 6).   After dancing inside or out, I highly recommend the strawberry-banana daiquiri at Tres Amigos (1657 rue Ste-Catherine). Where to eat . For breakfast, dessert, or really any meal, a crepe from Paris Crepes (corner of Crescent and Ste. Catherine) will suffice. The mouthwatering ""strawberry cheesecake crepe"" consists of fresh strawberries, chocolate syrup, and what appears to be pieces of cheesecake mashed up into gooey goodness. If you're willing to spend a few extra loonies -- that's what Quebecers call their dollar coins -- enjoy a hearty Italian meal at Il Cortile (1442 rue Sherbrooke Ouest) in a quaint courtyard with colorful flowers hanging from terraces above. No trip to Canada is complete without poutine, a dish of French fries smothered in sauce and topped with lots of cheese. The city has many places where you will find this staple in at least a dozen forms, for vegetarians and meat-lovers alike. One reliable 24-hour restaurant specializing in poutine is La Banquise (994 rue Rachel Est), not far from the Mont Royal metro stop.  Art on the street  About an hour before I left for the airport, I happened to pass a crowd of fascinating people -- or rather, a sculpture of a crowd of fascinating people -- at the corner of Rue Sherbrooke and Ave McGill College. The spectators of ""Illuminated Crowd"" by Raymond Mason have come together for some reason, but why? And why do some appear terribly frightened, and others perhaps more hopeful? In your frenzied wanderings through the city, it's worth a minute to walk around it and reflect.","Montreal is a little more than a five-hour drive from major New England cities .

"(CNN) -- A police chief from southeastern New Hampshire who planned to retire in a few days has been shot to death while trying to execute a search warrant, authorities said Friday. Chief Michael Maloney of the police department in Greenland, a town of about 3,500, was killed in a shooting that wounded four other officers on Thursday night at a home in the community, said Attorney General Michael Delaney. ""This is a tragedy for our community,"" he said. ""Our law enforcement community is in mourning."" Two suspects, a man and a woman, were found dead in the home after a long stand off, Delaney said. Investigators believe the deaths came from either a ""murder-suicide"" or a ""double suicide,"" he said. Greenland is just south of the city of Portsmouth. Its police force has 10 members, the town says on its website. During a news conference Friday, Delaney was asked why a police chief would be part of a dangerous mission so close to his retirement. He did not answer the question directly but said all the officers involved were part of a drug investigation. The shootings come after a year in which U.S. cities saw an increase in officers killed. The number of officers who died in the line of duty in 2011 increased 16% nationwide from last year, according to the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund. Last year, 177 officers were killed, compared with 153 in 2010, the organization said.","The police chief in Greeland, New Hampshire has been shot to death .

"(CNN) -- A 20-year-old Florida International University baseball star was charged last week with the rape of two females in Nassau, police said Monday. The athlete, Garrett Wittels, has been released on $10,000 bail, Bahamas Police Department Press Officer Sgt. Chrislyn Skippings told CNN. ""We are aware of the case and we are providing all appropriate consular assistance,"" said a U.S. Embassy spokeswoman in Washington. ""We are providing all appropriate consular assistance and, due to privacy concerns, we are unable to share specific information about this case."" The 6-foot, 1-inch, 198-pound infielder finished the 2010 season on a 56-game hitting streak, the second-longest in NCAA Division 1 baseball history, according to FIU's website. Calls to Wittels' family, FIU and the NCAA were not immediately returned. The junior shortstop was with four friends from Miami, Florida, when the incident allegedly occurred, said Skippings, who added that all five were charged. But the mother of one of the friends said only three of the five were charged, and that all five had returned to Miami. ""I really think all of them are innocent,"" said Dalilah Tromberg, mother of Steven Tromberg, in a telephone interview. ""These kids are going to prove, at the end, that they are innocent. The truth will prevail."" She added that her son and another of the group were not charged. ""They are all wonderful boys from great families and I've known them for many years, most of them."" Tromberg said she could not add more. ""I've been told not to discuss,"" she said. Wittels was named this month to the National Collegiate Baseball Writers of America Preseason All-America Team. His streak, which will carry into the 2011 season, puts him two games behind Robin Ventura's 1987 record of hitting in 58 straight games. According to FIU's website, Wittels is slated to start on Feb. 18, when FIU hosts Southeastern Louisiana.

"London (CNN) -- New figures show that tough trading conditions across Europe are forcing many firms to making even tougher financial decisions -- particularly when it comes to their travel budgets. Paul Tilstone, the managing director of the Global Business Travel Association (GBTA) in Europe, says it's not surprising that companies are slashing spending on business trips. ""What we're seeing are companies putting in place critical-only travel plans and that has a knock on effect,"" he added. ""It's not about growth now for a lot of companies -- it's about survival. Unless something is considered critical to the running of the business, then it won't be authorized."" With travel expenditure often one of the biggest expenses within a business it becomes fundamental to reduce budgets. So where are the cuts being made? Hotels that were once perceived as cheap are now viewed as adequate and comfortable. The days of expensive flights are also long gone. ""The standard now, is people travel in economy rather than business class,"" said Tilstone. ""When trips are authorized, companies want more out of them. They want more bang for their buck."" Latest figures from the GBTA show varying levels of growth and decline across five critical markets in Western Europe in 2012: Germany, UK, France, Italy and Spain. Together they make up nearly 70% of business travel across the continent -- but Germany is the only nation where an increase has been reported. Spending there will have grown by 1.6% by the end of the year. Elsewhere, the picture isn't as rosy. In the UK spending has flat-lined, while in France it will have dropped by 2.2%. The situation in the south of Europe is worse still, with spending on business travel in Spain and Italy dramatically decreasing. Overall it means a reduction in spending of 2.2% across Western Europe -- and paints an even bleaker picture than the projections issued by the GBTA during the spring. ""The spring 2012 outlook was formulated in May and since that time conditions in Italy, Spain, Greece, and France, among others, have worsened,"" said Tilstone. ""The debt crisis may have been moved to the media's and stock market's back burner at the moment, but the crisis is still problematic and has caused economic conditions to worsen."" For some companies, it's obvious that cutbacks are a necessary evil. But what kind of effect do they have on productivity? ""I take dozens of trips a year, and around 30 to 35 of those are international,"" added Tilstone. ""If I had to travel in economy all the time it would take its toll on my well being. It's about finding a balance. You don't want your employees becoming less productive individuals."" Stewart Harvey says he's not surprised by downgrading of the figures by the GBTA. As the commercial director of British corporate services provider HRG he specializes in ensuring companies make the most of their travel arrangements. He says a growing number of firms are exercising caution around their travel budgets. ""Businesses are not out to stop traveling,"" he said. ""But there's a lack of confidence and they're putting controls on what they are spending. ""They want to record the purpose of the trip. Why are their employees going and who are they going to see? Is it external or internal? Are they going after a customer or extracting more business? ""People are being conservative and cautious because they are thinking about their whole business and they don't know what's ahead."" Although the GBTA's projections for 2012 are bleak, particularly for southern European countries, its outlook for next year makes for slightly more pleasant reading. The association predicts a 1.4% bounce back in 2013, which it links to job growth and any likely increase in GDP. Is this a barometer for the region's wider economy? ""There is coloration,"" said Tilstone. ""There are suggestions that there's a one quarter time lag between growth in business travel and growth in economies. ""But with lingering debt challenges and continued austerity measures, the European economy is likely to continue to be challenged for years to come. The GBTA's fall report therefore remains cautious."" But Harvey isn't convinced the projections for growth next year will come to fruition. ""How on earth would we know that? We don't have a crystal ball with that assurance,"" he said. ""In our experience, most companies aren't looking that far ahead. Planning for the long term is now viewed as three to four months in advance.""","European businesses are putting ""critical-only"" travel plans in place .

"New York (CNN) -- A man arrested in connection with the death of 28-year-old Betty Williams, whose body was found in a suitcase, has confessed to bludgeoning her with a frying pan and strangling her with an electrical cord, authorities said Tuesday. Hassan Malik, 55, was arraigned Tuesday on one count of second-degree murder, according to Manhattan District Attorney spokeswoman Joan Vollero. Malik said he was acting in self-defense, Vollero said. Shortly after Williams' body was discovered, police released a surveillance video that showed a man dressed in a dark knit hat and leather jacket, pulling a suitcase that contained Williams' body near a stoop in East Harlem, New York. Malik originally told police that he found Williams dead inside his apartment, but later he recanted the statement and confessed, according to the criminal complaint. As police were leading Malik away, a reporter asked, ""Are you sorry for what you did?"" ""Yes,"" he replied. The New York Medical Examiner's office said Williams had suffered, among other injuries, blunt force trauma to her head and asphyxiation, the complaint said. Malik was being held on $100,000 bail and is set to appear in court Thursday, Vollero said. If convicted, he could face 25 years to life in prison.

"JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (CNN) -- Fifteen girls at Oprah Winfrey's South African leadership academy blew open the abuse scandal that the talk show host says shook her to her very core. Oprah Winfrey tells a Monday news conference how she found out about abuse charges and what she did. Winfrey, on Monday, praised the teens who chose to approach the school's CEO in an environment that the millionaire described as fearful and encouraging silence. ""They represent, those 15 girls, the new generation of youth in South Africa who fearlessly take back their voices to speak up about their concern for their fellow classmates,"" she said, speaking to a news conference in Johannesburg by satellite hookup from Chicago. The woman arrested in the case, Tiny Virginia Makopo, 27, was formally charged Monday with 13 counts of abusing and assaulting students at the school. She pleaded not guilty and was released on bail. Winfrey said police in South Africa had asked her not to speak about the case publicly until an arrest was made, and she was now free to discuss the details. Winfrey -- who has spoken publicly about the abuse she suffered as a child --  said she first heard that there was a problem from the school's CEO, John Samuel, on October 6.  Watch how Winfrey heard about the abuse and what she did Â» . ""Mr. Samuel informed me that 15 girls had come to his office to see him with a list of grievances, including suspected sexual abuse of one of their classmates by a dorm matron,"" she said. School authorities removed Makopo from the campus and notified police, Winfrey said, and set up an independent team of investigators ""because my experience with child predators is that no one ever, ever abuses just one child."" The remaining dorm matrons were removed because students were afraid of ""repercussions,"" Winfrey said, and teachers were assigned to oversee the dorms. She said students cheered and cried for joy when they heard about the change. ""I told them that although they had apparently been living in an atmosphere that repressed their voices, that this was a chance for them to break the silence and to take their voices back,"" she said. As the investigation developed, five other girls stepped forward to say they had been victims, and new facts emerged about the student whose case had inspired the complaints by the group of 15. The girl had left the school earlier in the year, Winfrey said.  The explanation she had been given was that the student's mother wanted to spend more time with her; but other students later said it was because of problems with a dorm matron. ""I am prepared to do whatever is necessary to make sure that the Oprah Winfrey Leadership Academy for Girls becomes the safe and nurturing and enriched setting that I had envisioned,"" Winfrey said.  Watch Oprah talk about being a ""momma bear"" to the children Â» . ""Knowing what I know now, the screening process was inadequate"" for Makopo's position, Winfrey said. ""We are going to redefine what that position should mean and what the qualifications for that position should be."" She said the contract of the school's headmistress will not be renewed when it expires at the end of the year. Winfrey said the school was in the process of getting cell phones for the girls so they could call her directly and that some of the students were getting counseling. Makopo faces charges of assault, indecent assault, and crimen injuria. Indecent assault is defined in South Africa as touching the private parts of another person without consent; crimen injuria involves verbal abuse which violates the victim's dignity. The state alleges there were seven victims. Six are between the ages of 13 and 14 and one was 23. It is not clear when the abuse happened, and only some of the allegations are known. Police have confirmed that one instance involves Makopo allegedly grabbing a girl by the throat and throwing her against a wall, but Winfrey also mentioned sexual abuse of the girls. The prosecutor said that ""as a dormitory parent, she [Makopo] was in a trusted position,"" and that Makopo abused that trust. Makopo was released on bail of 3,000 rand [U.S.$460]. Her next court appearance is December 13. Winfrey said when she first heard about the abuse charges, she cried for half an hour. ""I was so stunned I couldn't even wrap my brain around it,"" she said. ""Within the hour I pulled myself together and started making calls and preparing for what to do next and how to best look after the girls."" ""What I know is, is that no one -- not the accused nor any persons -- can destroy the dream that I have held and the dream that each girl continues to hold for herself at this school,"" she said. ""We will show that the resilience of the human spirit is actually stronger than poverty, it's stronger than hatred, it's stronger than violence, it's stronger than trauma and loss, and it's also stronger than any abuse.""

"Fort Lauderdale, Florida (CNN) -- A judge put former New York Yankees catcher Jim Leyritz on probation for a year for a wreck that killed a south Florida woman in 2007, but spared the onetime World Series hero jail time. Leyrtiz had faced up to six months in jail after his November conviction for driving under the influence, but he was spared the prospect of up to 15 years in prison when jurors acquitted him of DUI manslaughter. ""I am telling you now that if you violate probation, I will give you the maximum jail sentence,"" Broward County Circuit Judge Marc Gold told Leyritz on Thursday. Leyritz was convicted of driving drunk in the December 2007 accident that killed 30-year-old Freida Veitch. The wreck occurred after he had spent his 44th birthday with friends in Fort Lauderdale bars, and tests after the accident indicated he had a blood-alcohol level of 0.14 percent -- well above Florida's legal limit of 0.08. ""That night -- my birthday -- and every year, I will remember that night, your honor,"" a tearful Leyritz told the judge. Leyritz played most of his 11-season major-league career with the Yankees, hitting a clutch home run against the Atlanta Braves in Game 4 of the 1996 World Series that helped propel New York to the championship. He also played with the San Diego Padres in the 1998 World Series against the Yankees. Prosecutors had argued for four months jail time in addition to a year of probation, but defense attorney David Bogenschutz argued that the offense was the first for Leyritz. Gold also imposed a $500 fine, the state's maximum, and revoked Leyritz's drivers license for six months. The victim's husband, Jordan Veitch, said Leyritch's conduct ""shows a lack of respect or the lives of others."" Freida Veitch also was drunk -- with a 0.18 blood alcohol level -- and was not wearing her seat belt, according to court documents. Jordan Veitch acknowledged that his wife could have faced charges had she survived, but, ""She did not have an opportunity to be judged."" ""Mr. Leyritz will be able to kiss and hug his children again. He will be able to go on being a parent,"" Jordan Veitch said. ""Frieda will never have that chance to do any of these things again.""","NEW: The victim's husband says Leyritz showed ""a lack of respect or the lives of others""

"(CNN) -- At least 27 people were killed and 52 injured after an oil pipeline exploded Sunday morning in central Mexico, the state-run news agency said. The cause of the explosion in San Martin Texmelucan, in Puebla state, was under investigation, but preliminary reports pointed to the illegal extraction of oil from the pipe, said Laura Gurza, coordinator for civil protection in Puebla. The situation was under control, but the extent of the damage was still being assessed, Civil Protection Director Miguel Angel Martinez said. The pipe belongs to Pemex, the state-owned oil monopoly. Some 32 houses were lost in the blast, and 80 others were partially damaged, Martinez said. Video from the scene showed a huge billowing wall of smoke that reached into the sky. Rescue workers could be seen walking through the still-smoldering streets. Twelve of the people killed in the blast were children, the state news agency Notimex reported, citing Gurza. About 5,000 nearby residents were evacuated, officials said, and some 200 were in a government shelter. Oil theft has been a persistent problem for Pemex, and has been on the rise since President Felipe Calderon took office. A Washington Post investigation found that drug cartels were increasingly diversifying into other areas, including oil theft, to the tune of more than $1 billion in a two-year period.

"London, England (CNN) -- Closed-circuit television footage that led British police to identify Stephen Griffiths as a serial killer shows the self-proclaimed ""Crossbow Cannibal"" carrying the weapon in the hallway outside his apartment shortly after he killed one of his victims, then raising his middle finger to the camera. Griffiths, 40, was arrested May 25 after his building's caretaker saw the video showing Griffiths assaulting a woman, then alerted authorities, according to the West Yorkshire Police in northern England. London's Daily Mirror has posted the video of Griffiths in his apartment building on its website. The video was recorded minutes after he killed Suzanne Blamires, one of three prostitutes Griffiths confessed to killing, police said. The video, some of which was obtained by CNN from the Daily Mirror, then shows the Bradford man carrying a sack down the stairs of his apartment building. The newspaper said it chose not to publish video showing Griffiths dragging Blamires' apparently dead body by the shoulders down the corridor to his apartment. Police said they found human remains linked to his victims in the nearby River Aire. Griffiths was sentenced December 21 to three terms of life in prison after pleading guilty to the murders of Blamires, 36; Susan Rushworth, 43; and Shelley Armitage, 31. ""What he did can never be forgotten by the families of his victims. Suzanne, Susan and Shelley all came from families who cared for and supported their daughters,"" Senior Investigating Officer Detective Superintendent Sukhbir Singh said after the sentencing.","NEW: Newspaper chose not to publish video showing man dragging woman's body .

"(CNN) -- A missing Virginia girl and her alleged abductor were panhandling outside a San Francisco supermarket when someone nearby spotted them on Friday and alerted law enforcement, police said. Brittany Mae Smith, 12 -- for whom police have been searching since Monday -- was found Friday afternoon, as was 32-year-old Jeffrey Scott Easley. Easley is a ""very good suspect"" in the murder of Tina Smith -- his girlfriend and Brittany's mother -- who was found dead at her Salem, Virginia, home last Monday, Roanoke County, Virginia, Police Chief Ray Lavinder said Saturday. Easley and Brittany Smith left Virginia early last Saturday or late on Friday, December 3 -- the same day that the girl's mother was killed, according to Lavinder. A surveillance video from December 3 shows the pair shopping for a blue domed tent at a Walmart in Salem, Virginia. A similar tent was found within walking distance of the Safeway store in northern California, where a witness saw Easley and Brittany Smith on Friday. The tipster recognized the pair after watching broadcast report's about the case on HLN's ""Nancy Grace."" Lavinder said Saturday that he believes the girl and her alleged abductor were asking for money and holding up a cardboard sign when they were spotted. Police were called, and the two were found shortly thereafter outside the store, more than 2,300 miles from where the girl was reported missing four days earlier, Lavinder said Friday. Police in San Francisco contacted their counterparts in Virginia with the news. San Francisco Police Officer Albie Esparza said Brittany was turned over to California's Child Protective Services division after she was found. She has no visible injuries, has been in touch with family members and should return soon to Virginia, according to Lavinder. Easley did not resist arrest, he added. ""It's a fantastic sense of relief, and I know in my heart that it's due to information that you folks put out,"" Lavinder said Friday, thanking the media. ""It's a party atmosphere, believe me."" Authorities found Easley's car relatively early in the manhunt. Lavinder said Saturday that authorities had located a silver 2005 Dodge Neon four-door sedan with Virginia tags that belonged to Tina Smith in a parking lot adjacent to San Francisco International Airport. He said he believed the two had driven across country together, but he did not know when they arrived in California. Police issued an Amber Alert for Brittany on Monday after finding the body of Tina Smith, 41, after her co-workers called to express concern that she hadn't shown up for work. Authorities in Florida and Alabama followed suit in subsequent days and notices went out to law enforcement nationwide . Until Friday, Lavinder said the last known sighting of Easley and Brittany Smith was in December in the Salem, Virginia, Walmart. The chief said Saturday that four Roanoke County detectives were heading to San Francisco, to help bring back Brittany Smith and to deal with Easley. Lavinder said he hoped ""to get information back from them in the next 24 hours,"" though the earliest Easley could be extradited to Virginia is Monday, when California courts are back in session. He could head east relatively soon if he waived extradition, or the process could be delayed for weeks if he contested the return. Prior to his arrest, Easley was wanted for credit card theft, credit card fraud and abduction. Lavinder said that, ""we are concentrating most of our efforts ... on the homicide investigation."" The chief has said Easley met Tina Smith online this summer, then moved into the family home in October. Authorities said they do not know if the girl went willingly with Easley. Back east, the girl's great aunt told HLN's Nancy Grace on Friday night that Brittany already had talked to her father, and that there was widespread relief and joy from Salem to South Boston, Virginia, where many relatives live. ""Everybody here is just elated,"" said Lois Choquette, who is the late Tina Smith's aunt. ""It's been a terrible thing, but we are just so thankful.""

"(CNN) -- Among the thousands of diplomatic documents obtained by WikiLeaks, there is talk of Iranian missiles, German politicians and a myriad of other issues, including one cable about a British prince -- and his views on geography teachers, the French, journalists and Russian influence in central Asia. Back in 2008, the U.S. ambassador in the central Asian state of Kyrgyzstan, Tatiana Gfoeller, was invited to lunch with Prince Andrew, Duke of York, who was in the country to promote British interests. After the encounter, she observed in a cable: ""Astonishingly candid, the discussion at times verged on the rude (from the British side)."" When the conversation turned to the problem of corruption, one businessman said that working in Kyrgyzstan was ""like doing business in the Yukon"" in the 19th century, ""i.e. only those willing to participate in local corrupt practices are able to make any money."" ""At this point the Duke of York laughed uproariously, saying that: 'All of this sounds exactly like France.'"" At another point, according to Ambassador Gfoeller, ""the prince mused that outsiders could do little to change the culture of corruption here. 'They themselves have to have a change of heart. Just like you have to cure yourself of anorexia. No one else can do it for you.'"" Referring to his coming meeting with the Kyrgyz prime minister, Prince Andrew seemed exasperated. ""With a mock groan, the Duke of York then exclaimed: 'My God, what am I supposed to tell these people?!'"" The prince also addressed Russian influence in central Asia, stating that ""the United Kingdom, Western Europe (and by extension you Americans, too) were now back in the thick of playing the Great Game. More animated than ever, he stated cockily: 'And this time we aim to win!' "" ""The Great Game"" originally referred to the 19th century struggle between Britain and Russia for control of central Asia. The cable continued that Prince Andrew indicated he had little patience for the media interfering in the negotiation of business deals, condemning ""these (expletive) journalists, especially from the National Guardian, who poke their noses everywhere."" According to the ambassador's account, the prince also ""railed at British anti-corruption investigators, who had had the 'idiocy' of almost scuttling the Al-Yamama deal with Saudi Arabia."" That deal was a multibillion-dollar defense contract between BAE Systems and the Saudi government that became the target of a U.K. Serious Fraud Office corruption inquiry.) Warming to her theme, Ambassador Gfoeller continues: ""He then capped this off with a zinger: castigating 'our stupid (sic) British and American governments which plan at best for 10 years whereas people in this part of the world plan for centuries.'"" But she saves perhaps the best for last, referring to Prince Andrew's ""unmitigated patriotic fervor."" One British guest at the lunch had noted that despite the might of the American economy, British investment in Kyrgyzstan was of a similar magnitude. ""Snapped the Duke: 'No surprise there. The Americans don't understand geography. Never have. In the U.K., we have the best geography teachers in the world!'""","The U.S. ambassador to Kyrgyzstan had lunch with Prince Andrew in 2008 .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Israel must halt West Bank settlement activity and the Palestinians need to increase West Bank security to advance the Middle East peace process, President Obama said Thursday after meeting with Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas. Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, left, meets with President Obama Thursday. ""I am confident that we can move this process forward if all the parties are willing to take on the responsibilities and meet the obligations that they've already committed to,"" Obama told reporters in a joint appearance with Abbas following the White House meeting. Abbas said his Palestinian Authority was committed to fulfilling its obligations under the 2003 Middle East road map. The two men called for immediate progress in the peace process that could lead to renewed direct talks between the Palestinians and the Israeli government. No formal Palestinian-Israeli negotiations have occurred since Israeli elections in February brought Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to power. ""What is needed right now is to resume the discussions with the current Israeli government,"" Abbas said. The talks came days before Obama is scheduled to meet with Saudi King Abdullah in Riyadh and deliver a long-awaited speech on relations between the United States and the Muslim world in Cairo, Egypt . Last week, Obama pushed Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for a firm Israeli commitment to Palestinian statehood as part of the so-called two-state solution -- a position strongly advocated Thursday by Abbas. Netanyahu has committed to removing illegal settlement ""outposts"" but has also pledged to continue expansion, or ""natural growth,"" of existing settlements. At the same time, Netanyahu has refrained from endorsing Palestinian statehood, arguing that Israel first needs security guarantees and a clear Palestinian partner for peace talks. A total of 295,000 Israelis live in the West Bank, according to the Council for Peace and Security Talks. Another 194,000 live in the disputed area of East Jerusalem. Obama said Thursday it was in the interest of Israel, the Palestinians and the United States for both sides to show their commitment to the two-state solution proposed by the 2003 road map.  Watch Obama say he is a ""strong believer"" in a two-state solution Â» . ""It is in our interest to ensure that Israel is safe and secure,"" he said, adding that the best way to achieve that is to create the necessary conditions to ""set the stage for a Palestinian state."" ""I'm confident that if Israel looks long-term -- looks at its long-term strategic interests -- that it will recognize that a two-state solution is in the interests of the Israeli people as well as the Palestinians,"" Obama said. At the same time, Obama said he told President Abbas ""in a frank exchange"" that continuing anti-Israel sentiments and incitements in Palestinian schools, mosques and public squares were ""impediments to peace."" The Palestinian Authority headed by Abbas holds power on the West Bank, while the militant Palestinian Islamist group Hamas controls Gaza. Obama noted that Abbas is under pressure to negotiate with Hamas on creating a unified Palestinian leadership, and praised him for insisting that such a Palestinian leadership must agree to Israel's right to exist and commit itself to peace. ""I want to publicly commend President Abbas for taking that position, because I think it's in the interest of the Palestinian people and the people of the region,"" Obama said. The struggle to balance Palestinian sovereignty and Israeli security was highlighted earlier Thursday, when Israeli anti-terror forces killed a suspected Hamas military leader in a West Bank village south of Hebron. Israel accused 45-year-old Aded El Majid Dodeen, of, among other things, involvement in suicide bombings on buses in Jerusalem. Abbas' meeting with Obama comes at what many observers believe is a pivotal time in the Middle East peace process. ""There is a critical window of opportunity, and it would be sensible for us to pass through it,"" former British Prime Minister Tony Blair told members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee two weeks ago. Blair has served as the United Nations' primary Middle East envoy since stepping down as Britain's prime minister in 2007. ""We have a new [United States] administration that has come in and from the outset has said, 'This is a priority for us,' "" he said. ""You have the Arab peace initiative, which signals that the Arab world is prepared to recognize Israel and to be part of this process. You have a basically unified international community position"" in favor of a two-state solution. ""If we cannot move this forward now, I think the risk is, there will be many people within Israel and within the Palestinian territories who will conclude it can't be moved forward."" But without proper security, a Palestinian state will continue to be viewed as a threat rather than an opportunity for Israelis, Blair argued. At the same time, many observers say, the Palestinians need greater economic opportunity and more complete control over their territory.

"Washington (CNN) -- U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and her South Korean and Japanese counterparts jointly condemned North Korea on Monday for recent attacks and nuclear arms proliferation that the three diplomats said threaten stability and peace in the Korean peninsula and, more broadly, the Far East. The trio pledged support for South Korea in the latest escalation of its long-running conflict with North Korea, and urged China to take on a larger role in constraining Pyongyang. ""We all agree that North Korea's provocative and belligerent behavior jeopardizes peace and stability"" in the region, Clinton said after a meeting at the State Department in Washington with South Korean Foreign Minister Kim Sung-hwan and Japanese Foreign Minister Seiji Maehara. Any effort to resume multinational talks with Pyongyang ""must start with North Korea ceasing all provocative and belligerent behavior,"" Clinton said at a joint news conference by the three. ""We want the people of South Korea to know we are standing shoulder-to-shoulder with you and that we are deeply committed to your defense,"" Clinton said. Kim said the United States, Japan, and South Korea all ""share the view that North Korea will face severe consequences"" if it launches further attacks on his country. Monday's meeting came as Adm. Mike Mullen, the chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, prepared to depart Washington for South Korea, Pentagon officials said. The hastily planned visit is aimed at reassuring the South Korean military of U.S. support, according to the officials. ""The principal message is to the South Koreans that we continue to stand by them in the defense of their territory, for stability on the peninsula,"" said Capt. John Kirby, a spokesman for Mullen. ""Nobody should mistake our resolve,"" Kirby said, adding that the situation on the peninsula is tense but ""relatively stable"" at the moment. Next week, Deputy Secretary James Steinberg will lead a delegation to Asia to follow up on Mullen's visit, two senior administration officials told CNN on Monday. The delegation will include Kurt Campbell, assistant secretary for Asia, and Jeff Bader, the White House's top Asia adviser, the two senior administration officials said. At the joint news conference, Maehara said Japan would send an envoy to China to discuss the situation. China is North Korea's main ally, and Clinton said Monday that the three diplomats agreed in their talks that China should be doing more to get North Korea to change its behaviour and meet its international responsibilities. Meanwhile, the International Criminal Court said Monday it had opened a preliminary investigation into North Korean shelling of South Korea's Yeonpyeong Island last month, as well as the March sinking of a South Korean warship -- allegedly by a North Korean torpedo -- to evaluate if the incidents constitute war crimes. A preliminary investigation will determine whether criteria for an investigation is met, the court said in a news release. Four people died in the Yeonpyeong incident; 46 South Korean soldiers died in the Cheonan sinking. North Korea, meanwhile, continued its strong rhetoric Sunday, blaming its southern rival for stoking tensions in the region. North and South Korea are technically still at war, 57 years after the Korean War truce. Through the state-run Korean Central News Agency, Pyongyang said the ""South Korean puppet group ... is getting more frantic in military provocations."" The report warned that Seoul was ""rapidly driving the situation on the Korean peninsula to an uncontrollable extreme phase."" These latest comments come as South Korea, the United States and Japan have stepped up their public cooperation, further isolating the communist state. On Saturday, President Barack Obama announced what he called a ""landmark"" trade agreement with South Korea that he said would bolster U.S. exports by $11 billion, support 70,000 American jobs and eliminate tariffs on more than 95% of industrial and consumer goods. Meanwhile, the United States and Japan are holding the largest ever bilateral military exercises between the two countries, according to the U.S. military. The exercises, dubbed ""Keen Sword"" and running through December 10, include elements throughout mainland Japan, Okinawa and the surrounding waters. Monday's meeting among top diplomats of the United States, South Korea and Japan aims to bring together three ""cornerstones of the region,"" according to a senior State Department official speaking on background because of the issue's diplomatic sensitivity. Representatives from Russia and China -- part of the six-party talks which have focused on North Korea's nuclear program -- were not invited to participate. But the official stressed that China, especially, should not view its exclusion as a ""snub."" U.S. officials have been pressuring Beijing to do more to exert its influence on North Korea and urge Pyongyang to cease its aggressive behavior. Obama called Chinese President Hu Jintao on Sunday -- Monday in China -- and told him that North Korea needs to ""halt its provocative behavior,"" according to the White House. The state-run Chinese news agency Xinhua reported that Hu called for a ""calm and rational response from all sides to prevent the deterioration of the fragile security situation"" on the Korean peninsula. North Korean officials have been pushing for the resumption of six-party talks including China and Russia. But the United States has thus far refused, looking first for proof that North Korea is serious about not stoking military tensions and stifling development of its nuclear program. The conflict in the Koreas has intensified since November 23, when North Korean forces launched an artillery barrage Yeonpyeong Island. Pyongyang accused the South of provoking the attack, which also injured 18 people, because shells from a South Korean military drill landed in the North's waters. The following week, members of the U.S. military joined their South Korean counterparts in a military drill that, while long ago scheduled, was meant as a show of military force. Meanwhile, the South Korean navy on Monday began live-fire exercises on seas surrounding the Korean peninsula. The exercises are taking place off all three coasts of the peninsula, officials at South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff told Yonhap. They are scheduled to last through Friday and are a routine monthly exercise aimed at securing the safety of ships in the area, the officials said. The Korean Central News Agency lambasted the exercises in a Sunday article, claiming Seoul is trying to orchestrate another clash around the border island ""at any cost"" and ""ignite a war."" Kim Kwan-jin, South Korea's new defense minister, said Friday his country will respond with airstrikes if North Korea attacks it again, in some of the strongest rhetoric since the Yeonpyeong incident.

"Giglio, Italy (CNN) -- A Hungarian was among at least 11 people who died after the cruise ship Costa Concordia ran aground and rolled on its side last week off a Tuscan island, officials said Wednesday. The mayor's office in Grosseto, the provincial capital, identified the victim as Sandor Feher, a member of the crew. His body was one of five recovered Tuesday. The office said 26 people remained missing. But the list may include some of the five victims. Rescue crews suspended operations Wednesday as the ship began to move, the Italian coast guard said. The search for survivors has been halted and restarted several times. The family of two missing Americans, Gerald and Barbara Heil of White Bear Lake, Minnesota, said it was thankful for perilous attempts to find those still unaccounted for. ""While it is certainly hard for us to see the recovery efforts stall due to the unstable conditions ... we are also very concerned for the safety of the Italian coast guard as they continue to put forth a heroic effort in trying to find those who remain missing,"" relatives wrote. Experts say chances of finding survivors are slim. ""I think you have to look at several issues. One is just the hypothermia. If a compartment is flooded, even if there was air, at this point, most of them would have succumbed to the hypothermic problem of the water temperature,"" said Butch Hendrick, president of the diving safety company Lifeguard Systems. Costa Serena, sister ship of the Concordia, sailed by the wreckage Wednesday night, safely navigating the waters around the island of Giglio. Read more about the island that bears witness to tragedy . The investigation is focusing on actions by Concordia Capt. Francesco Schettino. Prosecutor Francesco Verusio has accused the captain of piloting the ship too fast to allow him to react to dangers, causing the shipwreck, according to legal papers. Judge Valeria Montesarchio's initial ruling found Schettino changed the ship's course, steering too close to shore and causing the ship to hit a rock. The judge said the captain admitted to making a mistake and that, at the time of the collision, he was navigating by sight. Schettino may face charges including manslaughter, shipwreck and abandoning a ship when passengers were still on board, prosecutors said. Read court documents on the case against Francesco Schettino (trans. by La Repubblica) In her preliminary investigation, Montesarchio said there appears to be considerable evidence against the captain, whom she said showed ""imprudence and inexperience."" The judge's findings included: Schettino made no serious attempt to return to the ship, he underestimated the damage to the Concordia and he failed to alert authorities in a timely manner. ""The captain could not but realize right away the gravity of the situation both because of the tilt and because he was alerted by the crew of the water influx,"" Montesarchio said. The captain abandoned ship while at least 100 people were still on board, the judge said. Montesarchio described the shipwreck as ""a disaster of global proportion."" Royal Caribbean International Capt. William Wright, speaking on behalf of Cruise Lines International Association, an industry group, said crews must use available technologies, including radar and GPS systems, and compare readings to nautical charts. Looking out the bridge window is an aid to navigation, Wright said, but ""that should absolutely by no means be your primary sense of position referencing."" The shipping industry newspaper Lloyd's List reported that Friday was not the first time the Costa Concordia steamed extremely close to shore near Giglio. Satellite tracking data obtained by the paper show that the ship passed within 230 meters (755 feet) of the coast of the island at least once before, even closer than the location where the Costa Concordia hit the rocks lasted weekend. The pass happened on August 14, 2011, Lloyd's List reported. ""It must have come within sniffing distance of the underwater rock that it hit on this voyage,"" editor-in-chief Adam Smallman of Lloyd's List told CNN's Anderson Cooper on Wednesday night. Costa Cruises chairman Pier Luigi Foschi earlier this week said a pass near the island last summer occurred only once, on August 9-10, 2011. The discrepancy in the dates could not be reconciled late Wednesday. The pass occurred ""under the authorization of the maritime authority, local maritime authority with the authority of the island aware, and with the permission of Costa, after having reviewed the route that the captain intended to take nearby the island,"" Foschi said, adding the vessel was observing San Lorenzo, known as night of the shooting stars. The executive said the pass was not to be within 500 meters of the island. Foschi on Monday placed the blame for the wreck squarely on the captain, saying it was his choice to deviate from frequently traveled routes. ""We believe it has been a human error here,"" Foschi said. ""The captain did not follow the authorized route, which is used by Costa ships very frequently. There's probably more than 100 times in one year we have this route."" Schettino was arrested after leaving the ship while dozens were still aboard, panicked and fighting for lifeboats. In transcripts of conversations between Schettino and the Italian coast guard, published by the Italian daily newspaper Corriere della Sera, the captain gives conflicting accounts of what happened when the ship hit the rocks Friday night. At first, Schettino tells an official he had abandoned the vessel, according to the transcripts, which prosecutors say match those used in their investigation. But as the official questions his decision, Schettino appears to reverse himself and say he had not abandoned ship but was ""catapulted into the water"" after the ship ran into a rock, began taking on water and started listing. In a later conversation, an Italian coast guard official demands Schettino return to his ship, the transcripts show. ""You get on board! This is an order!"" Capt. Gregorio De Falco instructed Schettino. ""You have declared 'Abandon ship.' Now I'm in charge. You get on board -- is that clear?"" the port official said. De Falco's tough tone has been celebrated across Italy, with even a T-shirt on sale featuring another line he uttered to Schettino: ""Get on board, damn it."" A Facebook page praising De Falco's comments had nearly 17,000 ""likes"" Wednesday. There were roughly 4,200 people on the Costa Concordia when it ran aground -- about 3,200 passengers and 1,000 crew members, the vast majority of whom made it off the ship safely. Italian prosecutors have ruled out a technical error as the cause of the incident, saying the captain was on the bridge at the time and had made a ""grave error."" But they are examining whether others may share responsibility for the crash with the captain. Schettino was transferred to house arrest, his lawyer, Bruno Leporatti, said. Montesarchio justified the move on the grounds that the captain is not a flight risk and there is no danger of his interfering with evidence or committing the crime again. The captain was under house arrest in Meta di Sorrento. In London, where he was meeting with British Prime Minister David Cameron, Italian Prime Minister Mario Monti said he did not want to get ahead of the ""multiple and meticulous inquiries"" under way, but ""obviously, any such disaster could and should be avoided."" He added that Italian authorities are also working to avoid any environmental damage as the result of the shipwreck. The company said it has hired a salvage company to recover the remaining fuel from the ship, with work beginning by the end of the week. Kevin Rebello, whose brother Russel was a member of the crew, refused to give up hope. His brother was last seen helping passengers into lifeboats Friday night. ""Miracles do happen, and let's keep hope. I'm not here to lose hope,"" Kevin Rebello said.

"New York (CNN) -- Outgoing New York state Sen. Pedro Espada Jr. and his son, Pedro, were charged Tuesday with embezzling $500,000 from a federally funded health care nonprofit, according to a statement from the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of New York. Federal prosecutors slapped both men with five counts of embezzlement and one count of conspiracy, the statement said. Espada served as president and CEO of the Comprehensive Community Development Corp. -- referred to locally as the Soundview Health Care Network -- which receives more than $1 million in federal funding from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, it said. The network receives millions of dollars more in Medicare and Medicaid reimbursements each year, the statement said. The pair are accused of abusing their senior positions to divert Soundview funds for personal use and for the benefit of family members and friends, the statement said. ""The indictment alleges that funds that could and should have been applied to purchase medical equipment and enhance health care services for an historically under-served population were diverted by the defendants for their personal use and to benefit friends and family members,"" U.S. Attorney Loretta Lynch said. ""In these difficult economic times, the charged crimes are all the more reprehensible."" Defense attorney Susan R. Necheles said the Espadas ""deny any wrongdoing, and we intend to fight the charges in court."" Soundview Health Care Network includes five health centers that cover the southeast, central and northeast sections of the Bronx, according to its website. The group's mission ""emphasizes the provision of quality health and social services to individuals regardless of their ability to pay."" In April, New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo said he would sue Espada, the state's senate majority leader, calling his fellow Democrat's alleged transgressions ""outrageous."" ""I have not seen anything on this scale,"" Cuomo said after originally charging him, along with 19 associates, with ""looting"" the nonprofit of more than $14 million. ""Thirty years ago, Sen. Espada founded the Soundview Health Care Center,"" Necheles said in a written statement. ""Soundview has provided high quality health care to thousands of families, children and senior citizens in the Bronx. Today is a sad day for Soundview and a sad day for the Espada family."" If convicted, the men face a maximum sentence of 55 years in prison, as well as a fine of $250,000 on each count, according to the U.S. attorney's office.","Sen.

"Washington (CNN) -- Leaders of the different branches of the U.S. armed forces gave sharply divergent answers to the Senate Armed Services Committee on Friday when asked whether the military's controversial ""don't ask, don't tell"" policy should be repealed, and what the consequences of a repeal might be. They appeared united, however, in their belief that a repeal would be better handled if ordered by congressional legislation rather than a ruling from the courts. The strongest resistance to allowing gays and lesbians to serve openly came from Marine Corps Commandant Gen. James Amos, who warned of potentially strong repercussions in terms of unit cohesion. ""If the law is changed, successfully implementing repeal and assimilating openly homosexual Marines into the tightly woven fabric of our combat units has strong potential for disruption at the small unit level, as it will no doubt divert leadership attention away from an almost singular focus of preparing units for combat,"" Amos told the committee members. Army Chief of Staff Gen. George Casey said a repeal of the policy could be implemented with a ""moderate risk to our military effectiveness and the long-term health of the force."" ""I believe the law should be repealed eventually,"" he said, but the question ""is one of timing.""  Casey said he ""would not recommend going forward at this time, given everything the Army has on its plate."" Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. Norton Schwartz said he believes the law should be repealed ""at some point ... perhaps 2012"" but it would not be prudent to pursue ""full implementation (of a repeal) in the near-term."" Chief of Naval Operations Adm. Gary Roughead recommended a repeal of the policy, noting that 76% of sailors are either neutral or feel positively about a repeal of ""don't ask, don't tell."" Coast Guard Commandant Adm. Robert Papp noted that a majority of members in his branch of the service appeared not have a problem with a repeal, but that ""prudence dictates"" proceeding with caution. Gen. James Cartwright, the vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said he believes implementation of a repeal would involve a ""manageable risk with regard to military effectiveness."" even in light of the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. In fact, Cartwright argued, the ongoing conflicts may make a repeal of the policy easier.  During a conflict, members of the military ""rely on the warrior ethos"" of their fellow soldiers, and lifestyle concerns are diminished. The service chiefs were summoned to testify in the wake of a newly released Pentagon study which concluded that allowing openly gay or lesbian troops to serve in the military would have little lasting impact on the U.S. armed forces.  Opposition to the change, however, appeared to be much higher in Army and Marine combat units than in the military as a whole. Arizona Sen. John McCain, the committee's top Republican, said at Friday's hearing that the divergent military opinions reinforced his view that more debate is warranted.  He also predicted that 41 other senators -- enough to prevent the issue from coming up for a final Senate vote -- would oppose legislation repealing ""don't ask, don't tell."" ""Our economy is in the tank and the American people want that issue addressed,"" McCain said, referencing GOP demands to extend the Bush tax cuts before Congress tackles other issues. ""And the military is functioning in the most efficient, most professional, most courageous fashion than at any time in our history. ... We shouldn't be exercising a rush to judgment."" But Michigan Sen. Carl Levin, the Democratic chairman of the committee, said he remains a staunch of advocate of a repeal of ""don't ask, don't tell."" Levin said there was greater resistance to allowing gays and lesbians to serve openly in the British and Canadian militaries than there is in U.S. armed forces today.  But now, he noted, gays and lesbians are allowed to serve openly in both countries, and there has been ""no evidence"" of diminished combat effectiveness as a result. One key GOP moderate -- Massachusetts Sen. Scott Brown -- announced his intention Friday to support a repeal. ""When a soldier answers the call to serve, and risks life or limb, it has never mattered to me whether they are gay or straight,"" Brown said.  ""Having reviewed the Pentagon report, having spoken to active and retired military service members, and having discussed the matter privately with Defense Secretary (Robert) Gates and others, I accept the findings of the report and support repeal based on (Gates') recommendations that repeal will be implemented only when the battle effectiveness of the forces is assured and proper preparations have been completed."" President Barack Obama, Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Adm. Mike Mullen and Gates all support a repeal of the policy. Mullen told the Armed Services Committee Thursday that he believes that even among those combat forces, a transition to a new law is possible. ""Should repeal occur, some soldiers and Marines may want separate shower facilities. Some may ask for different berthing. Some may even quit the service.  We'll deal with that. But I believe, and history tells, that most of them will put aside personal proclivities for something larger than themselves and for each other,"" he said. With just weeks left for this Congress, the calendar could be the biggest factor weighing on whether the law is repealed or upheld.  The House has already approved the repeal.  Now, with Armed Service Committee hearings over, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, must decide whether to keep legislative language calling for a repeal in a larger Defense authorization bill or strip it off for a separate vote. Despite McCain's assertions, some Democrats have expressed cautious optimism they can find the 60 votes needed to overcome a potential Senate GOP filibuster against the measure.  Gay rights groups are pressuring Democratic leaders to find a way to pass the repeal before the end of the year.  Once more conservative Republicans take over the House and pick up several seats in the Senate in January, there will be little chance to change the current policy, they warn. GOP calls for more debate, many of them argue, are little more than another way to kill the measure. ""I think given the testimony by members of the military that they still have serious reservations about repealing 'don't ask, don't tell,' Democrats have to be very concerned about the chances for a full repeal this session,"" said Wendy Schiller, a Brown University political scientist. ""The last thing they need, and more acutely the last thing President Obama needs, is a long protracted filibuster by the Republicans on this issue to close out the lame duck session."" A top congressional analyst, the Brookings Institution's Thomas Mann, said that there are likely enough votes in the Senate to repeal ""don't ask, don't tell"" and that ""the only hurdle, and it's a big one, is time."" ""Cloture takes a lot of time and this is only one of many issues on the plate of the lame duck,"" said Mann, referring to the procedure by which the Senate ends debate on legislation. ""If it goes over to the next Congress, it will likely take a serious threat of judicial action against (don't ask, don't tell) to get it to move."" Schiller contended that, for supporters of a repeal, ""what is daunting is the real possibility that 'don't ask, don't tell' falls victim to presidential politics."" ""Given a choice between emphasizing and winning policy battles on the economy and allowing gays to serve openly in the military, the good money bet is on the economy,"" she said.  ""If Obama is worried about getting independents and moderate Democrats back into the fold for 2012, he may give up the fight only because that core constituency will want to see all of his energy devoted to the economy and not distracted by what the public sees as essentially a gay rights issue."" But on the other hand, Schiller pointed out, ""what 2010 showed is that if the Democratic base stays home, Obama can't win re-election.  So how tied is the Democratic base to repealing the 'don't ask, don't tell' policy?  That is the $64,000 question."" CNN's Alan Silverleib contributed to this report .","Sen.

"(CNN) -- Minnesota Vikings quarterback Brett Favre was fined $50,000 Wednesday by the National Football League for failing to cooperate with an internal investigation into whether he sent sexually explicit texts to a New York Jets hostess. But NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell, citing a lack of evidence, ""could not conclude that Favre violated league policies relating to workplace conduct,"" the league said in a statement. The NFL was unable to establish whether Favre sent objectionable messages to New York Jets game-day hostess Jenn Sterger in 2008, when he played quarterback for the Jets. He joined the Vikings in 2009. The league also found no evidence to contradict assertions by Favre and Sterger that they never even met in person. But Goodell determined that ""Favre was not candid in several respects during the investigation, resulting in a longer review and additional negative public attention for Favre, Sterger, and the NFL,"" the league said. The NFL had expanded its investigation to look into a second media report alleging further misconduct by Favre with other women who worked at the Jets' facility during the 2008 season. ""Misconduct by Favre regarding that claim was unable to be substantiated because individuals with potentially relevant information declined to be interviewed or otherwise cooperate with the investigation,"" the league said. Goodell has told Favre that if the investigation found a violation of the league's workplace conduct policies, the commissioner would have imposed a ""substantially"" bigger penalty. The league said it doesn't judge private conduct or personal relationships except where that conduct or those relationships raise issues under the law or league policies. In the allegations involving Sterger, the NFL reviewed public reports, its interviews with several individuals including Sterger and Favre, communications between the two and an independent forensic analysis of electronically-stored material. ""The investigation was limited in several respects because the conduct occurred in 2008 but was not brought to our attention until this fall. As a result, certain records and individuals were unavailable to the NFL,"" the NFL said in a statement. The overall investigation took longer than expected because the league had trouble arranging interviews with key individuals and a lot of time was needed to gather stored electronic records, the league said. Goodell also decided to meet personally with Favre and Sterger, which added more time to the inquiry, the league said. There was no evidence to suggest that Sterger engaged in any inappropriate conduct, according to the statement. Goodell used the occasion Wednesday to remind all NFL teams about improper or unlawful conduct in the workplace. ""Every member of every club's staff should be able to work in an environment free of harassment or hostility, and one in which every employee is valued, respected, and given a full opportunity to contribute to the goals of the club and the NFL,"" Goodell said in the league statement. ""Our new training program on workplace conduct will help all of us to promote the right kind of environment for all employees and I intend to dedicate the fine I have imposed on Favre to help fund that training program.""

"London, England (CNN) -- Singer Annie Lennox was honored by Queen Elizabeth II on Friday for her charity work, receiving an award for her role as an ambassador with Oxfam. The former member of the Eurythmics, famous for songs such as ""Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)"" and solo hits including ""Walking on Broken Glass,"" was honored for her work fighting AIDS and poverty in Africa. Lennox is one of 997 people on the 2011 New Year Honors List, which is released every Dec. 31 and recognizes outstanding achievement and service. Other big names on the list include actors David Suchet, known for his portrayal of Agatha Christie's detective Hercule Poirot, and Sheila Hancock, a famous face on British stage and screen. Both received a CBE, which stands for Commander of the Order of the British Empire, the highest honor below a knight or dame. A CBE also went to Trevor Horn, the record producer behind some of pop music's biggest hits from the 1970s to the present day. His extensive discography ranges from ""Video Killed the Radio Star"" by the Buggles, ""Relax"" by Frankie Goes to Hollywood, and Band Aid's ""Do They Know it's Christmas?"" to Seal's ""Kiss from a Rose"" and albums from Charlotte Church and John Legend. Fashion designer Katherine Hamnett, famous for her 1980s slogan T-shirts with phrases such as ""Choose Life"" and ""Stay Alive in 85,"" also received a CBE. The co-founders of Lush Cosmetics, Margaret and Mark Constantine, received OBEs, which stands for Order of the British Empire, the next-highest honor. Their business began in a shed in their garden and has since grown to become a well known brand with more than 600 stores in 43 countries. Far from being big names, 74% of the recipients are local heroes, honored for outstanding work in their communities. They include a beekeeper, a driving instructor for people with special needs, an equine physiotherapist, and a woman who has coached girl's athletics for 60 years. The bridgemaster at London's Tower Bridge, Erick Sutherns, received an MBE, or Member of the Order of the British Empire.

"(CNN) -- I have the utmost respect for Dr. Cornel West and Tavis Smiley. Their accomplishments are vast. Dr. West, an academic philosopher at Princeton University, has for decades spoken up for the poor. Tavis Smiley, talk show host and author, has always used his platform to discuss the issues of the black community and the country as a whole. President Obama said during the 2008 campaign that we should be able to disagree without being disagreeable. That is a simple injunction that many in politics do not follow. That said, I respectfully disagree with West and Smiley's characterization of President Obama's first term in office. West has simply described it as a failure, and referred to the president as ""the black mascot of Wall Street oligarchs,"" and the ""head of the American killing machine."" Smiley has accused the president of ignoring the issues of the black community. The two held a 16-city ""Poverty Tour"" earlier this month, during which they aired their complaints about Obama. To hear them tell it, one would think that Obama is in the back pocket of Wall Street and the banks and has turned his back on the working poor, impoverished and middle class in America. I am not looking at President Obama's first term through rose colored glasses. There is always room for criticism and improvement; our president's decisions are far from perfect. But the criticism from West and Smiley leave out a lot. They ignore the positive moves Obama has made to benefit -- in real ways -- the black community, the poor, the disadvantaged, and the country as a whole. Let's take Obama and health care reform. Under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, which he shepherded and signed into law, insurance companies are no longer allowed to deny insurance to individuals because of pre-existing conditions. Children can now remain covered by their parents' insurance until age 26. No longer will there be kids fresh out of college starting in entry level positions walking around with no health insurance. The prescription drug cost for Medicare recipients was cut by 50%. More than 30 million people who did not have access to coverage will now have that access. This legislation is not perfect -- it lacks the public option many had hoped for -- but it is the largest federal reform in a lifetime, a tremendous accomplishment. Then there is the Children's Health Insurance Re-authorization Act, signed into law by Obama, which provides health care to millions of kids . Let's talk Obama and education. President Obama signed The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, which invests $5 billion in early childhood programs like Head Start. Studies show such programs help kids stay in school longer, earn more money in the long term and have lower involvement in crime. President Obama also expanded Pell Grants, which help low income students pay for college. He has done what no other president had done before by enacting the Student Aid and Financial Responsibility Act, which makes college more affordable while ending federal subsidies to private lenders and replacing them with a Direct Loan program. This is a direct contradiction of West's claims that the president has ""sold out"" to the big banks. The banks lost billions on this act; in taking them out of the equation, students are no longer held hostage to credit markets. Somehow, these accomplishments, which have a direct impact on the poor are not mentioned in West's and Smiley's critique. There's more. Obama signed the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, restoring basic protections against pay discrimination . Through the HIRE Act, signed in March, 2010, Obama gave $18 billion in tax breaks for small businesses. He signed a bill extending unemployment insurance. To review, then: Putting money into community colleges, job readiness programs, putting actual checks into actual hands -- these things don't sound like the actions of someone who doesn't care about the poor and impoverished. There is a very real crisis in this country. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, about 45 million Americans live in poverty. Unemployment is 9.1 %. Such statistics are, as Rep. Maxine Waters has said, ""unconscionable."" President Obama has been demonstrating that he knows this. So why make someone like him your enemy when you are fighting on the same side? If West and Smiley would like Obama to do more, that's valid. If they feel, like Rep. Elijah Cummings, that ""people need to know that the president feels their pain,"" that too is understandable. But the facts simply don't support the accusation that Obama holds a laissez-faire attitude toward economically marginalized Americans. He has faced huge partisan resistance. His campaign adviser, David Axelrod, says Obama will soon announce a jobs plan that is expected to include an extension of payroll tax cuts, new revenue for transportation projects and an extension of emergency unemployment benefits. He notes that there's nothing in the proposal ""that reasonable people shouldn't be able to agree on,"" yet many Republicans are already preparing to reject whatever the president puts on the table. Are they trying to stymie job creation initiatives, and then blame the president for high unemployment when the election rolls around? I'm not saying that President Obama should be exempt from criticism, nor do I believe it is some act of racial treason for a black person to hold our president accountable for his actions. But West and Smiley have a responsibility to present a fair and complete picture, not a skewed version. Could their slanted criticism result in so many of the working poor and impoverished working class becoming so discouraged that they stay home on election day in 2012? If they think they have issues with the president not doing enough for the poor now, wait and see what happens if the opposition takes office. Then they would really need a poverty tour. We must not forget the mess that President Obama walked into. Obama said in his victory speech, ""even as we celebrate tonight we know the challenges that tomorrow will bring are the greatest of our lifetime. ...The road ahead will be long. Our climb will be steep. We may not get there in one year, or even one term."" The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Etan Thomas.","Cornel West, Tavis Smiley critical of Obama's first term .

"New York (CNN) -- The boyfriend of a 33-year-old swimsuit designer, whose bruised body was found in a bathtub at an exclusive New York hotel on Thursday, has been charged in her death, officials said. Nick Brooks, 24, whose father -- Joseph Brooks -- is the Oscar-winning composer and director who produced the song ""You Light Up My Life,"" was charged with attempted murder and strangulation in the death of Sylvie Cachay, police said Friday. According to CNN affiliate WABC, authorities are treating the death as a homicide. However, Brooks cannot be charged with murder until the medical examiner determines the death was the result of a homicide. Police discovered Cachay, whose designs had been considered a celebrity favorite, at the Soho House club and hotel, according to a New York police spokesman who declined to be named, citing agency policy. Blog: Cachay remembered as 'light personified' Brooks was Cachay's boyfriend, according to CNN affiliate WABC. Cachay's body sustained bruising on the neck and bite marks, and was found clothed in the hotel room bathtub, the spokesman said. The city medical examiner said Friday the initial autopsy was inconclusive. The office will provide more details surrounding Cachay's death ""pending toxicology and tissue testing, which would take a few weeks,"" said spokeswoman Grace Burgess. ""Sylvie Cachay was one of those rare individuals who truly sparkled when she spoke,"" said publicist Kate Godici. ""She will be deeply and painfully missed, yet celebrated, honored and never forgotten."" The elder Brooks was indicted on multiple counts of sexual assault earlier this year, according to New York Supreme court documents.

"Salt Lake City (CNN) -- Jurors on Friday reached a verdict in the trial of Brian David Mitchell, accused of kidnapping 14-year-old Elizabeth Smart in 2002, a court spokesman said. The jurors -- who began deliberating Thursday -- were to decide whether Mitchell, 57, was legally insane when he snatched Smart at knifepoint from her bedroom on June 5, 2002. Smart testified at the monthlong trial that he led her to a makeshift camp in the canyons above her home, ""sealed"" her as his spiritual plural wife and raped her. U.S. District Dale Kimball instructed jurors that in order to acquit Mitchell under the insanity defense, they must determine he was mentally ill and that his illness was so severe it kept him from knowing right from wrong. Defense attorneys mounted the insanity defense for Mitchell, trying to convince jurors that Mitchell was so delusional he could not understand his actions were wrong when he abducted Smart. Several mental health experts testified for the defense, offering diagnoses that ranged from delusional to psychotic to paranoid schizophrenic. Prosecutors produced their own mental health experts, who testified that Mitchell was little more than a narcissistic pedophile who used religious dogma and claims he received revelations from God to get what he wanted. Smart spent nine months with Mitchell and his legal wife, Wanda Barzee, at makeshift camps in the Utah mountains and at a homeless camp outside San Diego, California. Now 23, Smart was the star witness for the prosecution. She said Mitchell raped her nearly every day of her captivity, some days more than once. She initially was kept tethered between two trees and treated ""like an animal,"" she testified. Later, she was allowed to accompany Mitchell and Barzee into town, but was forced to wear flowing religious robes and a veil. She was not permitted to speak to other people, she said. Mitchell claimed to be a prophet named Immanuel David Isaiah, who would take 49 wives and battle the Antichrist in the end times. Afterward, his family would hold exalted positions in the new kingdom. Smart said her job was to teach the new wives how to perform sexually. She said Mitchell claimed she was preordained to be his wife but never spoke of his destiny with outsiders. Many times, she said, he used his revelations to justify drinking, smoking or viewing pornography. Mitchell, Smart and Barzee were stopped by police in Sandy, Utah, on March 12, 2003. Smart was reunited with her family, and Mitchell and Barzee were charged by state authorities. When those cases bogged down over whether they were mentally competent to stand trial, the case moved to federal court. Barzee, 64, reached a plea bargain and is serving 15 years in prison. She testified for the defense and described Mitchell as a manipulator who took advantage of her religious beliefs. CNN's Lena Jakobsson and Ann O'Neill contributed to this report.","Jurors reach a verdict in Elizabeth Smart case .

"Washington (CNN) -- Lenient enforcement of a law requiring U.S. citizens to have passports when re-entering the country at land border crossings has heightened the risk that an imposter might get in, according to a government report released Monday. Under the law, which took effect in June 2009, U.S. citizens must show passports or some other authorized travel documents like a military ID when returning to the United States. Those who don't are supposed to undergo further screening to confirm their citizenship. But, during a phase-in period that now has stretched over 18 months, very few travelers have been referred to secondary screening, the report from the Homeland Security department's inspector general's office found. That assertion -- the study concluded -- ""increases the risk that someone could enter the U.S. under false pretense of citizenship."" The federal Customs and Border Protection agency, though, contends that the program is working, adding that it believes it is better to encourage compliance gradually then to enforce it right away. The inspector general's report is one of the first to look at compliance with the new passport law, which is known as the Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative. The law impacts all U.S., Canadian and Bermudian citizens, who previously were able to enter the United States at checkpoints along the Canadian and Mexican borders without passports. On a typical day, some 700,000 people arrive at U.S. land borders, trying to get into the country.  But every day, authorities say, some 4 percent -- or 28,000 people -- do not have the required documents. In an effort to implement the law without clogging international borders, Customs and Border Protection instituted a phase that it called ""informed compliance"" to transition the law into effect over time. It sought compliance through a carrot-and-stick approach, by promising the benefit of speedier travel and punishment of secondary screening and travel delays. The results have been mixed. Compliance has been greatest along the northern border, where 98 percent of travelers had the appropriate documents, the inspector general's report says.  Along the southern border, compliance has been spottier, with an average of 93 percent of travelers having required documents. Compliance is lowest at Texas border crossings, where 91 percent of travelers had everything they needed. The report suggests that the threat of slower travel has not led to higher compliance, noting that compliance rates have leveled off over time. The inspector general says the non-compliance rate could spell trouble when Customs and Border Protection seeks ""full compliance"" with the law, saying the latter agency does not have the resources to process large numbers of non-compliant travelers through secondary screening. As an example, it said the workload among secondary inspectors at the El Paso, Texas, border crossing could increase 125 percent with ""full compliance"" of the law. As the San Ysidro crossing in California -- the busiest land border crossing in the United States -- officials have only eight computer workstations at which to process an estimated 1,834 secondary inspections per day. ""Processing this number of travelers with these few computer workstations may cause considerable traveler delays,"" the report says. In a letter to the inspector general, Customs and Border Protection officials took issue with the statement that the passport law's full benefits will not be felt until the final ""full enforcement"" phase takes effect. The agency said the program is working, adding that it believes it is better to encourage compliance then to enforce it at this time. ""Travelers are never admitted until identity, citizenship and admissibility are established to the satisfaction of the inspecting officer,"" the agency said. ""In the event that a traveler does not possess a (passport or other authorized document), the inspecting officer will use all available documentary and system information, as well as oral questioning and inspection techniques, to establish identity and citizenship.""","A Homeland Security department IG report looks at enforcement of a new passport law .

"Atlanta, Georgia (CNN) -- Temperatures were slowly warming Thursday across the South, where freezing rain glazed roads with ice, but a sprawling winter storm system remained in place across the upper Plains states. The National Weather Service issued winter storm warnings and advisories for more than a dozen states. The brunt of the system is poised to hit Kentucky, Virginia and West Virginia, but several inches of snow are forecast for portions of Indiana, Ohio, Tennessee and North Carolina, as well as Minnesota and the Dakotas. Winter weather advisories stretched into Wisconsin and Minnesota. In Kentucky, up to a quarter-inch of ice could accumulate on roadways, the weather service warned, in addition to previously fallen snow. Three to six inches of snow were forecast for eastern Virginia. The low pressure system laid down an icy path across northern Georgia, Alabama and Mississippi on Wednesday. Scores of traffic accidents were reported Wednesday night and early Thursday. ""I personally slid through two intersections,"" one traveler said in Cherokee County northwest of Atlanta. ""I spun out a couple of times."" ""I grew up in Chicago, for God's sake,"" another driver said. ""This is an absolute disaster."" However, no significant power outages accompanied the wintry weather in Georgia. Fewer than 500 customers were without power as of about 11 a.m. Thursday, Georgia Power reported. Delays were reported at Washington's Reagan Airport and Atlanta's Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport on Thursday, according to the Federal Aviation Administration's flight status website. ""Winter weather in the Midwest & Southeast has impacted travel to, from, and through Iowa, Minnesota, North Dakota, South Dakota, Wisconsin, Michigan, Ohio, Georgia, Tennessee, and Kentucky,"" said an advisory Wednesday on the website for Delta Airlines, the largest carrier in Atlanta. AirTran Airways warned that the wintry weather could result in flight delays and cancellations, according to a company statement. AirTran passengers scheduled to travel either to or from Atlanta, Georgia, between 7 p.m. Wednesday and noon Thursday will be permitted to change their reservation without penalty as long as the travel is completed within three days of the originally scheduled departure date, the statement said. Up to a half-inch of ice was forecast to accumulate across Kentucky and Tennessee and into northern Mississippi and Alabama, raising the risk of downed power lines for residents across the region, the National Weather Service said. Two people died in a wreck on an icy bridge in Alabama on Wednesday, officials said, and another died in a car accident in Mississippi. Areas from Minnesota to Ohio to New York have seen more than a foot of snow in the past several days. The harsh weather stranded about 300 people in Canada Tuesday after what a local official called the most brutal storm to hit the Ontario region in more than two decades. Some people had been stuck in their vehicles for more than 24 hours after blinding snow piled up so high that opening vehicle doors proved nearly impossible. By Wednesday, officials said everyone had been rescued. On Tuesday, record lows were set from Virginia to Florida. High temperatures were 30 degrees below average for this time of year. The cold air lingered again Thursday morning, with freeze warnings posted as far as south as Boca Raton, Florida. But Florida's winter fruit and vegetable crops have so far survived the freezing temperatures without too much damage, industry officials said Tuesday.

"(EW.com) -- We haven't seen much of the new movie ""The Necessary Death of Charlie Countryman,"" which premieres at Sundance this week Ã¢â¬â not even the trailer is out. But we do know that it takes place in Romania and tells the story of a young man (Charlie Countryman, played by Shia LaBeouf), who falls for a Romanian girl (played by Evan Rachel Wood). The girl, however, is already spoken for by a vicious Romanian mob boss, hence the title's prophecy. Wood compares the film to 1993 Quentin Tarantino-penned romantic crime thriller ""True Romance."" ""It has a vibe of True Romance. It's a passionate, tender love story surrounded by chaos, violence, and crime,"" she says. And, like ""True Romance,"" it also has moments of humor. Wood said Rupert Grint's part in the film helps the actor shed his ""Harry Potter"" stigma and added a lightness to the dark movie. ""Rupert Grint is amazing in this film. It was such a brilliant idea to cast him. It's hilarious."" Special coverage: Sundance Film Festival . LaBeouf, who has a reputation of going the distance for roles, like drinking moonshine to learn about his character in last year's ""Lawless,"" reportedly took acid for a scene in which Charlie Countryman sees his dead mother while in a drug-induced state. LaBeouf wouldn't comment on the report, but did say there isn't much he wouldn't do for a role. ""As long as I am challenged and somewhat terrified, I am attracted to the project,"" LaBeouf told EW via email. Wood says she was excited to work with her co-star, noting that he comes onto set ""like a hurricane."" ""It's refreshing to work with an actor who's willing to throw himself so deeply into the role, into the project."" Sundance Film Festival's must-see movies . Both actors were enamored with the film's setting, shooting for six weeks in Bucharest, Romania. While LaBeouf's character is an American who travels to Romania, Wood had to adopt the accent, with the help of a dialect coach. ""I really tried to listen to the locals,"" she says of the accent. ""Kids would hear me do a scene and come up to me and start speaking Romanian to me and I wouldn't understand. They thought I was playing a game with them,"" she said. ""Romania was amazing,"" LeBeouf added. ""It really is a character in the movie and brings an authenticity to the film and helps the audience to escape into the world that our characters are living in."" Wood, who recently announced that she and husband Jamie Bell are expecting their first child, is known for her daring roles, starting with 2003Ã¢â¬Â²s controversial film ""Thirteen"" and running throughout her career, including last year's HBO film ""Mildred Pierce."" But Wood insists motherhood won't change her choices. ""I think I'll still take whatever roles inspire me, whether they be daring or not. I think I want to keep being me.""

Authorities in Spain arrested Konstantin Mrykhin, who was the commercial director of a nightclub in Perm, Russia where fireworks triggered a fire and panic on Dec. 5, 2009, the police said in a statement. Mrykhin has been wanted in Russia, where police say he ignored safety measures in organizing the fireworks display that caused the fire, the statement said.

"(CNN) -- A federal judge on Tuesday dismissed a lawsuit challenging Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski's write-in election victory last month, clearing the way for Murkowski to be sworn in for a second term next week. State officials have scheduled a Thursday morning ceremony to sign the election certification, according to Sharon Leighow, spokeswoman for Gov. Sean Parnell. The certification will then be flown to Washington to be delivered to the Secretary of the Senate. Shortly after the ruling, Alaska's lieutenant governor, Mead Treadwell, announced that the director of the Alaska Division of Elections had certified Murkowski as the winner, but his office later retracted that statement. The final vote count in the election was 101,091 to 90,839. Murkowski was defeated in the Republican primary in August by Miller, a Tea Party-backed candidate. Murkowski then waged the write-in campaign in the general election in November to defeat Miller, who filed a lawsuit challenging the result. U.S. District Judge Ralph Beistline had previously issued an injunction to block certification of the election results pending a resolution of Miller's lawsuit. In his ruling Tuesday, Beistline said ""the injunction is lifted and the Division of Elections may certify the election results immediately."" In Alaska, Beistline's ruling ""fully and finally resolved all claims raised by Mr. Miller and stated that they have absolutely no merit and no chance of success,"" said Scott Kendall, an attorney representing the Murkowski campaign. Miller said he was ""disappointed with the federal court's ruling,"" adding that he still believes his challenge is on solid constitutional ground. ""Thus, we are evaluating the ruling and determining what our next step should be,"" he said. Earlier this month, the Alaska Supreme Court ruled that the Alaska Division of Elections conducted the November 2 general election according to state law. Miller had claimed the way some votes were counted violated state law. In its ruling, the state Supreme Court affirmed an earlier Superior Court decision, saying: ""There are no remaining issues raised by Miller that prevent this election from being certified."" After the election in November, Miller filed a challenge against the Division of Elections to ensure the state law, which calls for write-in votes to match the name of the candidate, was followed. He has argued that Alaska law does not allow the counting of misspelled names on write-in ballots. However, the Division of Elections set guidelines before counting began that allowed for a voter's intent to be considered when determining whether to count a ballot for a write-in candidate. In the original Superior Court decisions, a judge ruled that Miller did not provide proof of election official fraud, or that ""there would be a sufficient change to the election results if these claims were true."" The Associated Press called the race for Murkowski last month when she had a lead of  more than 10,300 votes over Miller, a figure that included 8,159 ballots contested by Miller observers. Not including the contested ballots, Murkowski's lead still exceeded 2,100 votes.","NEW: The vote count is to be certified at a Thursday morning ceremony .

"(CNN) -- No charges will be filed against San Francisco 49ers wide receiver Michael Crabtree, who was investigated over an alleged sexual assault, officials said. San Francisco police completed a thorough investigation, District Attorney George Gascon said in a statement issued Friday. ""Following a review of all the evidence, my office has determined that no charges will be filed against Michael Crabtree at this time,"" Gascon said. The San Francisco Police Department released a statement on January 18 saying it was investigating ""an allegation of a sexual assault involving San Francisco 49ers Michael Crabtree."" The complaint was about an alleged assault that occurred in a San Francisco hotel on January 13, police said, but the statement offered no further details. A day before, the 49ers had scored a playoff victory, beating the Green Bay Packers. Police on January 18 said Crabtree was interviewed with his lawyer present and he cooperated. The athlete was not detained or arrested. After the district attorney announced there would be no charges, 49ers General Manager Trent Baalke said the team was pleased with Gascon's decision. ""Michael and the team can now put this behind us and move forward,"" Baalke said. The 49ers will play the Baltimore Ravens at Super Bowl XLVII on February 3.

"(CNN) -- Hillary Clinton answered her critics. North Korea threatened theirs. As the week comes to an end, here's a look back at these stories and other international news that developed, including a surprising election in Israel and a growing humanitarian crisis in Syria. Clinton in Benghazi hot seat . At times angry and choked with emotion, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton appeared before two congressional committees Wednesday and answered questions about her department's handling of the attack that killed four Americans, including a U.S. ambassador, in Benghazi, Libya, last year. While Clinton was mostly calm and composed during the two hearings, which lasted more than five hours in all, she became visibly frustrated when Sen. Ron Johnson, a tea-party backed Wisconsin Republican, said the American public was deliberately misled. ""With all due respect, the fact is we had four dead Americans,"" Clinton said, banging her hand on the table. ""Was it because of a protest or was it because of guys out for a walk one night decided they'd go kill some Americans? What difference, at this point, does it make? It is our job to figure out what happened and do everything we can to prevent it from ever happening."" What did we learn from Wednesday's testimony? Here are five of the key themes, including what Clinton did on the day of the attack. Clinton also warned of a growing security threat in North Africa, saying there was ""no doubt"" that weapons from Libya were used in last week's attack on an Algerian natural gas plant. Which leads to ... The future of terrorism? There are still outstanding questions over the Algerian standoff, which resulted in the deaths of at least 37 hostages. Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, the North African branch of al Qaeda, has claimed responsibility for the attack. Algeria said the attack was retaliation for letting France use its airspace in its offensive against Islamist militants in Mali. The question now is whether this was an isolated act of revenge or, as Clinton alluded to, an ominous sign of things to come in the region, where Islamist militants are quickly gaining traction. One expert believes we might be seeing the future of terrorism. ""Europe has become a difficult environment to conduct large-scale terrorist incidents, and America even more so,"" said Raffaello Pantucci, a senior fellow at the Royal United Services Institute, a British-based think tank that specializes in defense and security issues. ""But at the same time, groups desire to attack Western targets both for ideological reasons and to attract attention to their cause has not diminished. The net result is that they will aim to target Westerners where they can find and reach them."" North Korea's defiant threat . The U.N. Security Council adopted a resolution Tuesday condemning North Korea's recent rocket launch and expanding sanctions against the country. But North Korea remains defiant, saying it plans to carry out more long-range rocket launches and another nuclear test. It also vowed an ""upcoming all-out action"" to target the United States, which it called ""the sworn enemy of the Korean people."" By Friday, South Korea had been threatened as well. The U.S. envoy to North Korea responded by saying the U.S. would ultimately judge North Korea by its actions, not by its words. Some experts say the U.S. should give up on negotiation altogether and take a tougher stance. North Korea has conducted two previous nuclear tests -- one in 2006 and one in 2009 -- but analysts say it does not have the technology to mount a nuclear warhead on a missile. Israel's surprising election . As many expected, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his right-wing party received the most votes in Tuesday's national elections. But the surprising second-place finish of the centrist Yesh Atid party -- led by Israeli TV personality Yair Lapid -- might convince Netanyahu to form a more moderate government coalition rather than a hard-right bloc. (In Israel's Knesset, coalitions must be built because no single party ever wins a majority of seats.) ""The pundits did not understand what Israeli society was thinking and feeling,"" said Marcus Sheff, executive director of the Israel Project, an advocacy group. ""Instead of the far right, they went to the center. ... They were saying, 'Let's go to those values, the values Israel was established on, liberal Israel, secular Israel, moderate Israel -- an Israel where peace with our neighbors is important but security is also important.' "" The high voter turnout also confounded critics as the Israeli public ""turned out to be far more engaged than many had imagined,"" wrote Josh Block, CEO and president of the nonpartisan Israel Project. Syria's humanitarian crisis . As many as 20,000 Syrian refugees flooded Jordan this week, according to the nation's foreign minister and refugee officials. There are now nearly 700,000 people who have fled Syria for neighboring countries, straining resources in places like Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey. CNN's Ivan Watson visited a refugee camp in Turkey where a U.S. delegation arrived Thursday. He had an exclusive interview with the U.S. ambassador to Syria, who described how the U.S. has given $210 million in humanitarian aid and $35 million to help the Syrian political opposition. ""The assistance is going in,"" Ambassador Robert Ford said. ""It's things like tents, it's things like blankets, it's things like medical equipment, but it doesn't come in big boxes with an American flag on it because we don't want the people who are delivering it to be targeted by the Syrian regime."" Ford said the needs are gigantic and that much more aid is needed, but he stressed that even with help from the U.S. and other countries, ""it has to be Syrians who find their way forward."" Other notable stories from this past week: . -- Britain's Prince Harry reveals that he killed Taliban militants during his tour in Afghanistan. He also spoke out for the first time about his notorious Las Vegas trip and the nude photographs that surfaced. -- People from northern Mali share harrowing stories about the cruel punishments now being inflicted by Islamist militants there. -- A journalist embedded with U.S. troops in Afghanistan describes how the troops are using a ""tough love"" approach, stepping back so that their Afghan counterparts have no choice but to assume more responsibility and take over the fight. -- A 56-year-old British woman caught carrying more than 10 pounds of cocaine in her suitcase has been sentenced to death in Indonesia.","This week, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was grilled on the Benghazi terrorist attack .

"(CNN) -- Was it a theft? A prank? A roundabout effort to bring some holiday cheer to the police? Authorities in Harwich, Massachusetts, are probing the mysterious appearance of a piano, in good working condition, in the middle of the woods. Officer Derek Dutra of the Harwich Police Department examines the mystery piano in the Massachusetts woods. Discovered by a woman who was walking a trail, the Baldwin Acrosonic piano, model number 987, is intact -- and, apparently, in tune. Sgt. Adam Hutton of the Harwich Police Department said information has been broadcast to all the other police departments in the Cape Cod area in hopes of drumming up a clue, however minor it may be. But so far, the investigation is flat. Also of note: Near the mystery piano -- serial number 733746 -- was a bench, positioned as though someone was about to play. The piano was at the end of a dirt road, near a walking path to a footbridge in the middle of conservation land near the Cape. It took a handful of police to move the piano into a vehicle to transport it to storage, so it would appear that putting it into the woods took more than one person. Asked whether Harwich police will be holding a holiday party in the storage bay -- tickling the ivories, pouring eggnog -- while they await word of the piano's origin and fate, Hutton laughed. No such plans. Harwich police have had some fun, though. Among the photos they sent to the news media is one of Officer Derek Dutra examining the piano in the woods. The police entitled the photo ""Liberace."" CNN's Justin Lear contributed to this report.","Woman finds piano in woods near Cape Cod, Massachusetts, while walking a trail .

"(PopSci.com) -- Last winter, inventor John Kanzius was already attempting one seemingly impossible feat -- building a machine to cure cancer with radio waves -- when his device inadvertently succeeded in another: He made saltwater catch fire. A test tube full of saltwater fuels a flame. TV footage of his bizarre discovery has been burning up the blogosphere ever since, drawing crackpots and Ph.D.s alike into a raging debate. Can water burn? And if so, what good can come of it? Some people gush over the invention's potential for desalinization or cheap energy. Briny seawater, after all, sloshes over most of the planet's surface, and harnessing its heat energy could power all sorts of things. Skeptics say Kanzius's radio generator is sucking up far more energy than it's creating, making it a carnival trick at best. For now, Kanzius is tuning out the hubbub. The retired radio- and television- station owner says the saltwater stuff is interesting, but a cancer breakthrough is what he's really after. Diagnosed with leukemia in 2002, he began building his radio-wave blaster the next year, soon after a relapse. His lifelong fascination with radio provided further inspiration. Radio station antennas, he knew, can turn a bystander's metal eyeglasses toasty warm. If he could seed a person's cancerous cells with nanoscopic metal particles and blast them with radio waves, perhaps he could kill off the cancer while sparing healthy tissue. The saltwater phenomenon happened by accident when an assistant was bombarding a saline-filled test tube with radio waves and bumped the tube, causing a small flash. Curious, Kanzius struck a match. ""The water lit like a propane flame,"" he recalls. ""People said, 'It's a crock. Look for hidden electrodes in the water,' "" says Penn State University materials scientist Rustum Roy, who visited the Erie, Pennsylvania, inventor in his lab in August after seeing the feat on Google Video. A demo made Roy a believer. ""This is discovery science in the best tradition,"" he says. Roy thinks the sodium chloride in the water may weaken the bonds between the oxygen and hydrogen atoms, which are broken free by radio waves. It's these gas molecules that are igniting, he explains, not the liquid itself. Tests show that the reaction disappears once the radio waves stop. Roy plans to conduct more tests to get to the bottom of the mystery. Meanwhile, researchers at MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston and the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center have made progress using Kanzius's technology to fight cancer in animals. They published their findings last month in the journal Cancer. How it works: . Copyright Â© 2009 Popular Science .","Inventor John Kanzius uses a radio-wave blaster to make saltwater catch fire .

"Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama and House Speaker John Boehner met over the weekend as part of ongoing negotiations on an agreement to reduce the country's deficit, a Republican official told CNN late Tuesday. Also Obama said Tuesday he invited Democratic and Republican leaders from both chambers of Congress to the White House for a meeting Thursday to discuss deficit reduction and the need to raise the federal debt ceiling. Obama said he wanted the meeting to ""build on the work that's already been done and drive toward a final agreement"" that would address expanding federal deficits and bring congressional approval for increasing how much money the government can borrow. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, who earlier invited Obama to come to Congress to discuss the issue, will attend the White House meeting, his office announced. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid also plans to attend. Boehner indicated that he will take part but warned that Congress will not accept tax increases sought by Obama and Democrats. ""I'm happy to discuss these issues at the White House, but such discussions will be fruitless until the president recognizes economic and legislative reality,"" Boehner, R-Ohio, said in a statement. He added, ""I'm pleased the president stated today that we need to address the big, long-term challenges facing our country."" According to Obama, who made an unscheduled appearance in the White House briefing room, talks on deficit reduction over the Fourth of July weekend with congressional leaders from both parties made progress, but ""we still have to work through some real differences."" Both parties need to come out of their ""comfort zone,"" Obama said. But ""this should not come down to the last second."" White House spokesman Jay Carney later said Obama believes that everyone knows the issues involved in forging a comprehensive agreement to reduce federal deficits by as much as $4 trillion in the coming decade. Now it is time make hard decisions, with both sides compromising in order to reach an agreement that benefits the nation as a whole, Carney said. ""The ideal will never become law, whether you're a conservative House Republican or a liberal Democrat or the president of the United States,"" Carney said. ""You're never going to get everything you want, because our system doesn't work like that."" The Senate returned to work Tuesday, cutting short the planned weeklong Fourth of July recess, with its leaders resuming their tough talk on negotiations to cut federal deficits amid a looming deadline to raise the government's debt ceiling. The three-day Fourth of July weekend did little to change the rhetoric of recent weeks over deficit reduction talks and the need for Congress to increase the amount of money the government can borrow. In his opening remarks after the Senate reconvened, Reid, D-Nevada, accused Republicans of putting the nation's economic recovery at risk by threatening to oppose an increase in how much money the government can borrow. McConnell, R-Kentucky, followed Reid by accusing Democrats of wanting to increase spending to solve a deficit problem. Before Obama's invitation, McConnell repeated an invitation for Obama to come to Congress and hear from Republicans why they won't support any agreement that includes tax increases. Reid said his side was willing to compromise but would not allow Republicans to put the needs of ""a few millionaires and billionaires"" ahead of the rest of the country. With House members scheduled to return Wednesday, congressional leaders remain at sharp odds over what sort of conditions should be attached to a hike in the current $14.3 trillion ceiling. Republicans are refusing to go along with any increase unless it includes deep spending cuts and avoids any tax increases. Democrats are trying to minimize the impact of cuts to social services and are calling for the elimination to certain tax breaks and loopholes benefiting wealthier Americans. Treasury Department officials and leading economists have warned of potentially catastrophic consequences if the ceiling is not raised by August 2, at which point the country could default on its debt obligations. Among other things, the country could face skyrocketing interest rates and a plummeting dollar. Increasing the debt ceiling will allow the government to borrow more money in order to pay for spending already accrued. Given the short time frame, Congress and the White House may be forced to agree to a relatively small increase in the debt ceiling covering only a few months. Such a compromise -- including cuts already agreed to on both sides of the aisle -- would give leaders more time to negotiate serious budget reforms, including possible changes to popular entitlement programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. However, Obama said he's opposed to a short-term increase in the debt ceiling. ""I don't think the American people sent us here to avoid tough problems,"" Obama said. The debt ceiling dispute is a ""'unique opportunity to do something big"" and put the ""economy on a stronger footing for the future."" Over the weekend, top Democrats and Republicans gave no public indication that a potential compromise is in the offing. Talks led by Vice President Joe Biden recently collapsed over the tax dispute. ""The principle of not raising taxes is something that we campaigned on last November, and the results of the election was the American people don't want their taxes raised and they wanted us to cut spending,"" Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona, said Sunday on CNN's ""State of the Union."" ""They don't want compromise."" Various frameworks for a possible deal have been floated. Conservatives demand deep spending cuts, caps on future spending and a balanced budget amendment to the U.S. Constitution in return for their support to raise the debt ceiling. Both the House and Senate are planning votes on a balanced budget amendment in coming weeks. However, with such an amendment requiring approval from a two-thirds majority in both chambers and then ratification by at least 38 states, eventual approval is unclear in a process that can take years. For his part, Obama has chided congressional Republicans for refusing to make ""tough decisions"" at odds with their conservative base. He calls for what he characterizes as a balanced approach to deficit reduction that includes more revenue for education, infrastructure and clean energy, areas he considers critical to long-term economic growth. The Democratic position includes spending cuts elsewhere, including the military, as well as reforms to popular entitlement programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, the government-run health care programs for senior citizens, the disabled and the indigent. Republicans seek more sweeping entitlement reforms that Democrats contend would eliminate the safety net the programs were intended to provide.

"(CNN) -- Dario Franchitti won the 96th edition of the Indianapolis 500 motor race on Sunday, placing first in the prestigious race for the third time. The Scotland native and husband of actress Ashley Judd bested a field of 32 other competitors, including a female racer backed by the first all-female team in the Indy 500. They circled the track 200 times, traversing a total of 500 miles, powered by fuel and raw adrenaline. He and several other racers, including Scott Dixon and Tony Kanaan, traded the lead several times in the final minutes. But Franchitti was able to hold on and win, as he did in 2007 and 2010, after Japan's Takuma Sato tried to pass him on the last lap but ended up crashing instead. The victory was especially meaningful for Franchitti, coming a year after his friend Dan Wheldon earned the checkered flag at Indy and seven months after the Englishman died after crashing during a race in Nevada. Franchitti, Dixon and Kanaan all mentioned after the contest how all three of them were close with Wheldon, who was very much on their minds as they jostled for the win Sunday. In a photo on his Facebook page, Franchitti -- with a victory sash around his neck and bottle of milk, the traditional celebratory drink of Indy 500 winners, in his hand -- points to the sky in dedicating his win to his friend, known around the racing world as Lionheart. ""Everyone out there was a friend of Dan's. Everyone loved Dan,"" Franchitti told ABC, which broadcast the Indy 500. ""What a great race today."" The race featured a record-setting 35 lead changes, as well as a number of cautions -- including two in the final 13 laps -- as drivers fought for position, according to ABC. Nine drivers who started the race didn't end up finishing, for various reasons. Three-time winner Helio Castroneves ended up in 10th. The 22nd place finisher was Katherine Legge, the ninth woman to qualify for the race and more notably the first to bring an all-female team with her. The Englishwoman sported a Girl Scouts logo on her helmet and represented STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) as an ambassador. ""My parents said, 'You can be anything that you put your mind to,' "" Legge told CNN before the race. She said she hopes girls get the message ""to follow whatever they want to be. And they have to pursue that with 110 percent knowledge that they can get there if they really, really want to."" What to know about this year's race . For all the excitement during the race, much of the focus before it was on safety -- in part because of the death of Wheldon, a two-time Indy 500 winner killed in October in a 15-car crash at the Las Vegas Motor Speedway. Wheldon died when his vehicle became airborne and hit a fence pole. A new design being used this year is supposed to prevent cars from becoming airborne. Italian firm Dallara has created the new DW12 chassis, named for Wheldon, who helped test the car before his accident. Wider cockpits, wheel guards, a smaller engine, vertical wings on the side panels and energy absorption foam have all been added to keep drivers safer on the track and in the event of an accident. ""We'll all be driving with heavy hearts,"" driver Marco Andretti told CNN hours before the grandson of renowned driver Mario Andretti ran well but ended up spinning out with 13 laps to go. ""... I think we just have to think of what a happy person he was and how much he loved the sport and Indy in particular."" Meanwhile, the heat and humidity presented a challenge for drivers and spectators. Temperatures were in the mid-80s by morning and were expected to reach into the low to mid-90s. ""There is a heat advisory for Indianopolis today,"" said CNN meteorologist Bonnie Schneider. ""The temperature will soar to 96 degrees today and the heat index will climb to 100 degrees. Keep in mind that the normal high temperature for this time of year is 81 degrees, so this extreme heat is unusual.""

"(CNN) -- Saxophonist Clarence Clemons, a defining musical influence behind the sound of Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band, died Saturday of complications from a stroke. He was 69. Clemons died at a hospital in Palm Beach, Florida, where he was undergoing treatment after suffering a stroke last Sunday, said a spokesperson for Springsteen and the E Street Band. His fifth wife, Victoria, and other family members were at his side when he died, according to the spokesperson. ""His loss is immeasurable and we are honored and thankful to have known him and had the opportunity to stand beside him for nearly 40 years,"" Springsteen said in a statement posted on the band's website. ""He was my great friend, my partner, and with Clarence at my side, my band and I were able to tell a story far deeper than those simply contained in our music. His life, his memory, and his love will live on in that story and in our band."" The saxophonist's influence can be heard throughout Springsteen's musical evolution, including such early hits as ""Born to Run"" and ""Thunder Road."" His influence could also be seen in Springsteen's live shows, where the two men routinely bantered about their beginnings, their life on the road and their music. The story of their first meeting is musical lore. Depending on who was telling the story and when it was being told, the two men first met at the Stone Pony music venue in Asbury Park, New Jersey, where Springsteen was performing. As the story goes, Springsteen was performing when howling winds blew the door off. Springsteen was startled by the 6-foot, 4-inch towering figure of Clemons, who invited himself onstage to play. ""From the first time we saw each other, we stayed together for two weeks,"" Clemons told CNN in 2009 while promoting his pseudo-memoir ""Big Man: Real Life & Tall Tales."" ""We were inseparable,"" he said. Clemons was born in 1942 in Virginia and began playing the saxophone by age 9. He moved to New Jersey, where he worked as a youth counselor, before joining Springsteen's E Street Band. Clemons, whose fusing of blues, jazz and funk with rock on the saxophone put him in demand, recorded with a number of artists over the years, including Aretha Franklin and the Grateful Dead. In 1985, Clemons and Jackson Browne scored a duet Billboard hit with ""You're a Friend of Mine."" Clemons, who was dubbed ""Big Man"" by friends because of his height, made his last musical appearance in May when he took the stage with Lady Gaga on Fox's ""American Idol"" to perform ""The Edge of Glory."" Clemons also worked as an actor, appearing in TV shows such as ""The Wire"" and ""The Simpsons."" He also appeared in films, including ""New York, New York."" As word of his death spread Saturday night, fans, musical contemporaries and even politicians took to Twitter and Facebook to remember Clemons. ""A very sad night for Springsteen fans & all of NJ--thx Clarence Clemons for 40 years of magical & soulful music. He will be missed forever,"" tweeted New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie. The Stone Pony, which marked the musician's passing on its web site with a standalone photo of Clemons, announced it would open early Sunday to serve as a gathering spot for fans to remember the saxophonist. Springsteen's Facebook page was inundated with an outpouring of emotion from fans. ""RIP CC, you were the heart and soul of the E Street Band. Thank you for all the music, you got me through some dark days. Blessings on your journey,"" one post read. ""I just can't imagine that space on stage not being occupied by the big man. We are all better people having been moved by your huge music. Now go play with Louis, Miles and the rest and have a blast,"" read another. CNN's Denise Quan and Chelsea J. Carter contributed to this report.","Bruce Springsteen: ""His loss is immeasurable""

"Atlanta (CNN) -- A Spanish-language newspaper in Georgia has drawn bipartisan criticism for publishing a doctored photograph depicting the state's new governor as a Nazi. El Nuevo Georgia Editor Rafael Navarro said the picture was meant to call attention to Hispanic issues -- and grab the attention of residents and politicians who often ignore the Hispanic community. ""Americans don't read our paper because they can't read Spanish. They don't read our news, our editorials and the opinion of the community. But if they see a picture, they'll get it,"" he said. The photo illustration, published in the paper's January 6 edition, shows Republican Gov. Nathan Deal wearing a Nazi uniform, a swastika armband and a Hitler-like mustache. The accompanying story, entitled ""Repression in the Age of Deal,"" recaps an ethics investigation against Deal and talks about the governor's past financial troubles. The full-page article also quotes local community leaders forecasting tough times ahead for illegal immigrants in the state. One leader quoted is Democratic state Rep. Pedro Marin -- one of only two Hispanic legislators in Georgia. Marin condemned the photo and said he did not know about it when he spoke to the newspaper. ""It is disrespectful,"" Marin said. ""I might disagree with the policies of Governor Deal, but I respect him and the office he represents."" Marin said he understands firsthand what it means to be the target of inflammatory rhetoric. ""Ever since I got elected and began supporting immigrant issues, I have received hate mail and my house and car have been vandalized,"" he said. Marin said the photo might make it harder for the Hispanic community to communicate with state leaders. Deal, who took office earlier this month, has not spoken out about the photo. His spokesman, Brian Robinson, issued a statement saying, ""Those who can't formulate a coherent argument in our society's marketplace of ideas often resort to childish, even offensive tactics. This is pathetic."" Navarro, who immigrated to the United States from Colombia, said he printed the picture knowing he didn't have to fear retaliation from the governor because of the freedom of speech guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution. Marin recognizes that right, but also said that responsibility comes with freedom, adding that ""it is a shame that he decided to print the photo to sell more papers"" El Nuevo Georgia prints about 40,000 copies every month. Navarro admits that after other local media started to report on the controversy, traffic to the paper's website rose to record levels. But Navarro said the picture represents the fear immigrants in Georgia feel with the arrival of Deal to the state's top office, because of Deal's strong anti-immigrant rhetoric during the last campaign. Navarro pointed to Deal's support of legislation similar to laws enacted in Arizona aimed at tough enforcement against illegal immigrants. Deal was elected last November. He won the Republican primary, edging out a former secretary of state who was endorsed by former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin. Then he defeated Democrat and former governor Roy Barnes. Both of Deal's rivals also supported immigration legislation similar to Arizona's.","The newspaper's editor says he wanted to grab the attention of readers .

"Oranjestad, Aruba (CNN) -- Crews searching for an American woman have looked in Aruban phosphate mines, authorities there said Saturday. Articles of clothing were found Friday in one mine, but authorities had not determined whether they are related to the disappearance of Robyn Gardner, Aruban Solicitor General Taco Stein told CNN. FBI agents on Friday night searched the Maryland home of the suspect in the Gardner case, an agent said. The search occurred in the Gaithersburg residence of Gary Giordano, who is being held in an Aruban jail, FBI Special Agent Rich Wolf told CNN. Agents wearing vests that said FBI and carrying empty cardboard and plastic boxes arrived about 8:40 p.m. Friday. About 15 unmarked cars could be seen on the street, as well as a Montgomery County police vehicle. Supervisory Special Agent Philip Celestini, who was at the residence, declined to comment further on the search, citing the active investigation. Stein said earlier Friday that the suspect will appear in court Monday, where an investigating magistrate could order him held for at least eight more days, order him to remain on the island or release him outright due to a lack of evidence. Giordano was arrested by Aruban police on August 5, three days after Gardner, 35, was last seen near Baby Beach on the western tip of the Caribbean island. Giordano told authorities that he had been snorkeling with Gardner, also from Maryland, when he signaled to her to swim back, according to a statement. When he reached the beach, Gardner was nowhere to be found, Giordano allegedly said. The area that Giordano led authorities to is a rocky, unsightly location that locals say is not a popular snorkeling spot. Although prosecutors have continued to identify the 50-year-old American man by his initials, GVG, they also released a photo of a man who appears to be Giordano. His attorney, Michael Lopez, also has said that his client is being held as a suspect in Gardner's death. Lopez has not returned telephone calls seeking comment. Giordano is no longer cooperating with authorities in the investigation, Stein has said. Authorities are concerned for Gardner's welfare because she has not stepped forward despite all the publicity surrounding the case, Stein said. But they have no evidence that she is dead, he said. Although officials have stopped actively searching for Gardner, they are continuing to seek evidence in the case, Stein said. According to Aruban prosecutors, the missing woman and the suspect arrived July 31 from the United States. Lopez said Tuesday that his client came to Aruba on vacation with a female friend he had met on a dating site and has known for years. The Aruban prosecutor's office has declined to say what evidence led authorities to suspect Giordano's involvement in Gardner's disappearance. Richard Forester of Maryland said he and Gardner have been dating for the past seven or eight months. He told HLN's Nancy Grace on Wednesday evening that Gardner wasn't the type to go into deep water, and she would more likely stay by the pool. ""It's just not her to go out and snorkel,"" Forester said. CNN's Carol Cratty and Kim Uhl contributed to this report.","Authorities search phosphate mines in Aruba .

"Oranjestad, Aruba (CNN) -- A judge ruled Monday that there was enough evidence to continue holding a U.S. man in connection with the case of a missing American woman, Aruba's solicitor general said. Gary Giordano, 50, was arrested by Aruban police on August 5, three days after Robyn Gardner, 35, was last seen near Baby Beach on the western tip of the Caribbean island. The decision to hold Giordano for 16 more days was issued after a jailhouse hearing Monday afternoon, Aruban Solicitor General Taco Stein said. Giordano will be transferred from the jail to a prison Tuesday morning, Stein said. Meanwhile, clothing found during a search of Aruba's phosphate mines does not belong to the missing woman, Stein said.   The clothing was discovered Friday when crews were searching for Gardner, . Giordano's attorney urged authorities on Sunday to release his client. ""Today, nine days later, four voluntary interviews, two site visits, and more than 30 statements coming from different sources including witnesses and professionals, we cannot deduce that there is hard proof to sustain a demand by the public prosecutor against our client,"" Giordano's attorney, Michael Lopez, said in a written statement. ""In anticipation of any possible reason of prolongation of the client's detention, we can state that no felony has been committed by him,"" Lopez said. ""The Department of Justice at this time does not have any basis to request prolongation of his detention.""

"(CNN) -- Eighteen victims of child pornography were rescued during a nationwide sweep by federal law enforcement agencies, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement announced Friday. The sweep, dubbed Operation Orion, resulted in the arrests of 190 individuals. Most of them were in the U.S., but some were in Argentina, the Philippines, Spain and the United Kingdom, ICE said in a news release. The operation took place from May 1 to May 31. The arrests were made in 33 states and Puerto Rico, authorities said. Some of the victims were residing in the homes of the persons arrested, ICE spokeswoman Danielle Bennett said. For example, a child in San Diego was photographed in a shower, and authorities made a rescue in that home, Bennett said. ""Let this operation be a warning to anyone who would think they can use the Internet to exploit children: we are out there looking for you, we will find you, and you will be prosecuted,"" ICE Director John Morton said in a statement. Morton said that as children begin summer vacations, parents should pay extra attention to how much time they spend on the Internet. ""Many of the child exploitation cases under Operation Orion began with a child or teen chatting with someone he or she met online,"" Morton said in the statement. Related stories: .

"(CNN) -- In these difficult economic times, it seems almost obscene that 60 men will be battling for a share of $15 million this weekend. But the fact that they can, especially somewhere as hard-hit by the financial downturn as Dubai, is testament to the glowing health of golf's European Tour. The Dubai World Championship, the climax to the money-spinning Race to Dubai, is the last tournament before the tour begins its 40th year of existence. It has grown from an entirely Europe-based circuit of 20 events to an almost worldwide phenomenon which also takes many of the sport's top players to Africa, the Middle East and Asia. In 1972 the total prize pool was the equivalent of â¬350,000 ($470,000) but it has mushroomed to more than â¬132 million ($178 million) spread across 52 tournaments and 29 destinations -- driving exposure levels with its ever-growing television unit. Tiger holds no terror for golf's new stars . ""I think the whole principle of having your own players playing on your own golf courses televised by your own television companies has remained the coherent goal,"" chief executive George O'Grady told CNN from the emirate. ""We've moved the tour from a good promotional outfit into a solid operating business, and we can dictate or lead the way the game should be rather than always responding to the wishes of our sponsors. ""We listen to our commercial sponsors, obviously, and the TV companies, but we decide the direction we want the sport to go in."" A new world order . When the Dubai event and rebranding for the tour's traditional Order of Merit money list was announced in late 2007, it was trumpeted as the biggest prize in golf -- worth $10 million plus the same in bonuses. It was soon downsized to a $7.5 million tournament and that amount again in extras due to Dubai's well-documented debt problems, and the initial five-year agreement -- which was reduced to three -- is about to end. O'Grady told CNN he was confident a new deal to keep the event in the emirate will be announced before Sunday's winner is crowned. ""We're looking at a way to keep it in Dubai if we possibly can,"" the 62-year-old said. ""It's a perfect geographical location to finish our calendar year."" The Race to Dubai rebranding has helped the European Tour become a bona fide rival to its U.S. PGA counterpart, which has a $10 million jackpot of its own in the FedEx Cup series and still pulls in the most sponsorship. ""When we were the Volvo Tour with the Volvo Order of Merit, we united Europe on the European stage. This unites the European Tour on the global stage, and we finish in a place that is readily accessible from most of the countries we visit,"" O'Grady said. European success story . Whether world No. 1 Luke Donald makes history by becoming the first player to win the European and U.S. money lists in one season, or Rory McIlroy overhauls his fellow British star, 2011 has been another bumper year for European golf. Three of the season's four major titles were won by tour members, while Donald won one of the four World Golf Championship events and also tied for second, and Germany's Martin Kaymer triumphed at another. O'Grady is happy with the progress made since he took over in 2005, having helped launch the tour's commercial arm in 1984 and developed the television broadcasting side. Rights for the PGA Tour are fought over by three U.S. TV stations, but the European Tour's market is a lot more widespread. Top tips from one of golf's best coaches . ""We really grew it enormously when satellite channels began concentrating on sports, Sky specifically in the UK. Before that we had to own production ourselves otherwise we were always at the mercy of the BBC or TV in Spain, and it's a very difficult sport to televise,"" he said. ""Now our company televises more hours of tournament golf than anybody else in the world, and also at a lot of different times -- you've got to provide a service for 24-hour golf channels in Spain and France, then Korean television is very demanding and you've got India. It's an absolutely key part of our operation."" Alongside the main circuit, the second-tier Challenge Tour has almost â¬5 million in prize money while the Senior Tour offers more than â¬9 million. O'Grady said what was once considered the main challenge -- of producing future stars to maintain the sport's profile -- has already been addressed. ""The current success of the European Tour is really a pat on the back for everyone involved in golf in Europe, from the amateur clubs to the coaches to people who devote their time to bringing new people into the game. There's no shortage of people wanting to become professionals,"" he said. Olympic ambitions . And while growth has come from spreading to all corners of the globe, there is still a big focus on concentrating on the traditional heartlands of Britain, Spain and France -- which will host the prestigious Ryder Cup teams event in 2018. Eastern Europe is still a largely untapped market, and the return of golf to the list of Olympic sports from 2016 could spark further expansion. ""It has given it a higher profile in developing markets where the Olympic ideal remains so strong,"" O'Grady said. ""There's a huge number of new golf courses now in China since it became an Olympic sport, and the same with South America."" Unrest in the Middle East did lead to Bahrain losing the Volvo Golf Champions event, which will be held in South Africa next year, but O'Grady believes that golf has a big role to play in such countries. ""Golf is such a force for good and opens the doors in countries you go to, where it becomes more accessible to the local population. There's increasing accessibility. It can't all be done overnight, so you've got to make inroads."" O'Grady's goals . Players past and present serve on the tour's board and tournament committee, and O'Grady believes he has the support to continue in his role for the next few years at least. His wife suffers from multiple sclerosis and needs 24-hour care after suffering a brain haemorrhage two years ago, so the father of two has to balance his time spent away on golf business. ""I've had a lot to do with golf going to the Olympics, and I'd quite like to be around when it first happens. And I'd quite like to see the next Ryder Cup on Continental soil,"" he said. ""That will probably see me through. If you're doing what you enjoy and you're making a difference and the players are very happy with me ... if the players have had enough then I'd be off tomorrow. ""Talking to them here, to a man they all seemed remarkably positive and onside -- and you'd think they would be for the kind of money they're playing for!""","European Tour season ends this weekend with the big-money Race to Dubai finale .

"London (CNN) -- UBS to pay $1.5 billion over Libor manipulation, HSBC paid $1.92 billion for failing to stop money laundering, Standard Chartered paid $667 million, ING, $619 million, Credit Suisse, $536 million, ABN AMRO $500 million and the list goes on and on. While the number of fines imposed on banks has remained constant over the past 10 years, the value of fines has grown considerably faster than inflation. One has to ask, therefore: Is this the new norm? Are U.S. regulators using financial penalties as a method of indirect regulations? And will it actually work? American regulators have unique views about how to run a banking industry, views that often differ from their global counterparts. The latter, by and large, have a hands-off approach to an industry that is globally focused. The U.S. has tried, on countless instances, to influence global regulations. But it has been to no avail. The financial services market outside the U.S. is bigger than the domestic market. So, if Europe or Asia decides on its own path, the U.S. has very little power to stop it. It's therefore not unreasonable that the U.S. regulators impose different oversight on foreign banks than domestic equivalents. This is likely the reason we've seen fines of considerably higher value imposed on non-U.S. banks for similar infractions. Read more: Eurozone still has mountain to climb . Sure, some U.S. banks have seen fines in the hundreds of millions: Bank of America, JP Morgan, Wells Fargo come to mind. But the vast majority of U.S.-based fines are small. You would be forgiven for thinking this is discrimination. It's really indirect regulation. If a U.S. bank breaks rules, it is relatively easy for U.S. regulators to march into their offices, take all the material they need for an investigation and then dictate policy for the bank. In the case of a foreign operation, they can't do that. The U.S. authorities have no rights to material held in foreign offices. Further, once funds leave the U.S., they are often irretrievable without political help. This is the reason why global financial services regulations are necessary and inevitable, although decades away. By fining at the billion dollar level, banks wishing to operate within the U.S. will be encouraged to be far more carefully than domestic operations. This is exactly what the U.S. regulators want. Banks find it difficult to operate in the U.S. because they often have to adhere to rules that are diametrically opposed to rules in their home countries. Money laundering is a great example. The U.S. basically asks banks to assume Iranians and Iranian organizations are guilty until proven innocent, while the rest of the world wants banks to assume Iranians are innocent until proven guilty. This means global banks have to operate an infrastructure for U.S. rules and a second infrastructure for the rules of other regulators. The costs are high and the risks are many -- and banks simply don't want to do it. In the end, it's not going to work. The U.S. can fine HSBC or UBS all they want, these two banks are incredibly strong and can easily afford it. But what about troubled banks, or ones like government-owned RBS? If they were to levy the same fines for these banks they could put them out of business. If a bank of RBS's size went under, it could cause economic instability in its home country. The government would have to get involved. And fining them a lesser amount for the same infraction would not go down well with HSBC or UBS who would most certainly send a thousand lawyers to Washington to ask why they were discriminated against. After all, you get a $100 fine for going 20 miles over the speed limit if driving a Ferrari or a Ford. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ralph Silva.","Number of fines imposed on banks has remained constant for a decade, but fines' value has grown faster than inflation .

"(CNN) -- Japanese electronics company Panasonic has plunged from profit to a record annual loss of 772.2 billion yen ($9.68 billion), prompting its shares to fall to a 30-year low. The company blamed the annual loss on a number of factors including a drop in domestic demand due to electricity shortages in the aftermath of the Japan earthquake and tsunami in March 2011 . The global economic downturn also knocked sales of Panasonic products including flat-screen televisions and digital cameras, which came under ""intense price competition,"" the company said. The higher yen also bit into export income. Panasonic's poor performance follows record annual losses for rival Sony. On Thursday, Sony announced its worst ever annual loss of $5.7 billion in the fiscal year ending March. However, it was lower than beleaguered electronics giant's previous estimates of finishing the year $6.4 billion in the red. Both companies have struggled with ailing television manufacturing divisions, which have lost to lower cost rivals like Samsung and LG, and are hampered by a rising yen which has cut repatriated profits from overseas sales. Sony's television division has lost money for the past eight years. Panasonic has tried to steer the company away from its traditional and now sluggish revenue streams by molding itself into a green energy company. It's part-way through a three-year program called ""Green Transformation 2012,"" and the company said Friday there are signs it is paying off. ""With sales increases in products, such as air conditioners and refrigerators, meeting local needs in India and Brazil, and ""HIT solar cells"" by maximizing Panasonic Group sales strength in Japan, the positive results have started showing in some regions and businesses,"" Panasonic said in a statement. The restructuring should help lead the company back to profit, the company said, when it expects the ailing global economy to continue limping towards a sustainable recovery. Net income the next fiscal year is expected to reach 50 billion yen ($626 million).","Panasonic posts annual loss of almost $10 billion, prompting shares to drop .

"(CNN) -- Two survivors of the casino fire that killed 52 people in the Mexican city of Monterrey last week cast doubt on authorities' description of what happened, saying gunmen opened fire on gamblers inside before setting the building ablaze. Police have arrested five suspected members of the Zetas drug cartel in connection with Thursday's torching of the Casino Royale in Monterrey. The men told investigators they carried out the attack because the owners of the casino had not complied with their extortion demands, according to Adrian de la Garza, the attorney general of the Mexican state of Nuevo Leon. ""The people were not the target, it was the casino,"" de la Garza said Tuesday. ""It was a chaotic situation that got out of control."" He said the alleged arsonists shouted at patrons to leave the casino as they set it on fire. But two women who escaped the inferno told CNN the gunmen who stormed the gambling hall targeted patrons with guns and grenades before the fire started. One of the men told them, ""We're going to kill all of you,"" one of the women recounted. ""They didn't come asking for anyone. They came in harassing the people, shouting nasty things at us,"" she said. ""At that point, my girlfriend said, 'Let's run, let's get out of here or they're going to kill us.' Everything was out of control."" Both women asked to remain anonymous out of fear for their safety. But they said the attackers shot people and slot machines alike when they entered, and said the ordeal lasted for several minutes before police arrived. The second woman said the men wore ski masks, and that a different group set the blaze. CNNMexico.com (in Spanish): Surveillance video released . ""I didn't see the guys outside who poured the gasoline,"" she said. ""That happened after the shooting inside. That was the last thing that happened. The guys outside were not the same ones who threw grenades inside."" The women had gone to the casino to celebrate a friend's 26th birthday, they said. They ended up fleeing out an emergency exit after finding some of the emergency doors locked. One said there were five or six gunmen, another put the number at eight or nine. Authorities originally reported the deaths as a grenade attack, but later said the attackers had poured gasoline on the building and set it ablaze. Authorities are looking for seven additional people who were involved, de la Garza said. Police are also searching for the majority owner of the Casino Royale, Raul Rocha Cantu, who is believed to have fled to the United States, de la Garza said. The five men in custody were paraded in front of the media on Tuesday, each wearing a red vest emblazoned with the word ""detainee."" They were identified as Luis Carlos Carrazco Espinosa, 25; Javier Alonso Martinez Morales, alias ""el Javo,"" 37; Jonathan Jahir Reyna Gutierrez, 18; Juan Angel Leal Flores, 20; and Julio Tadeo Berrones, 28, alias ""El Julio Rayas."" Some of the suspects were directly involved in the fire, while others were accomplices, Nuevo Leon Gov. Rodrigo Medina said. The cartel members had backgrounds that included kidnapping and homicide, he said. ""We're talking about unscrupulous people who had already committed crimes of high damage to society,"" he said. Video from a gas station and the casino provided evidence that the suspects used gasoline as an accelerant at the casino, the officials said. The version of events was corroborated through phone conversations the suspects had and their own confessions, they said. Police identified the suspects as being from Monterrey, but one of the survivors said at least some of them had a distinct accent from Sinaloa, on the Pacific coast. She said she does not trust local or state police, and while federal authorities promise to investigate, ""nothing ever happens."" ""I adore my state. I love my country,"" she said. But she added, ""This is not the city I grew up in. ""You learn not to live here, but how to survive,"" she said. The massive fire and number of deaths shook the core of Monterrey, Mexico's wealthiest city and a key industrial hub. The city has been no stranger to the drug violence that has plagued northern Mexico, but the toll of the casino attack drew national attention in a country where headlines routinely describe brutal crimes. ""It's urgent to punish the guilty and avoid more attacks,"" the city's Business Coordination Council said. The council provided a list of steps the city could take, including strengthening police and passing national security laws that go after money laundering, . ""We cannot wait any longer, even if it is election season,"" the group said. Another citizens' group in Monterrey, the National Citizen Security, Justice and Legality Observatory, called on the federal government ""to combat crime at all levels."" ""We repudiate violence. We want peace and justice,"" the group said. Since 2008, the government has stepped up the military's presence in Nuevo Leon as it tries to crack down on crime. It sent more troops to the state last November. On Saturday, 300 soldiers from the Mexican Army and Air Force boarded planes in the nation's capital, bound for Monterrey as part of President Felipe Calderon's plan to help local authorities fight drug trafficking and organized crime, Mexico's defense department said. More than 34,600 people have died since Calderon announced a crackdown on cartels in December 2006, according to government statistics. Other reports have listed higher tolls. The latest Mexican government tally was released in January.","NEW: Witnesses recount gunmen shooting patrons, hurling grenades .

"(CNN) -- Kudos to the Department of Education for a new study documenting that black students, especially boys, receive much harsher discipline than other students in public schools. Many black people would tell you they knew this already, but it generally takes data for institutional change to occur. The coverage of the study in The New York Times last week got me thinking about what needs to be done. While we must attack the problem on multiple fronts, one part of the solution will not be found in scholarly journals or five-point plans. It is sleeping deep in our histories and needs to be awakened and put to work. It is the communal love of our children. Not just one or two of us doing it, and not just when it is convenient or our children are behaving and excelling. Children in trouble need caring and confidence-building now -- right now. The Times article took me back to thoughts I had in watching all the media coverage of the hit movie ""The Help,"" about black domestic servants and white women during the days of segregation. I remembered how profoundly the messages we get as children shape our world as adults. One of the most memorable lines from ""The Help"" rolls easily off my tongue. A black maid, Aibileen, repeatedly tells Mae Mobley, a young white girl she cares for: ""You is kind. You is smart. You is important."" Aibileen's message reaches far beyond the relationship of a black woman turned mother figure to a white child. It is a message that touches the very essence of human dignity and self-esteem in a world that can be unrelentingly cold and unkind. How much better a world this would be if every child were encouraged to be kind. Kind in the face of unkind acts and deeds. Kind when differences of opinion are strong and the stench of bigotry and discrimination are pervasive. Aibileen's lesson to Mae Mobley was not to become hardened by a world that was hard on her. She wanted Mae Mobley to remember, once she was old enough to discover that her form was not thought beautiful by her own kind, that she was smart and she was important. How much better a world this would be if every child was told she or he is smart. Would more of our children excel in math and science? Would fewer drop out of school? Oh what we could accomplish if every parent, every adult and every teacher said over and over and over, to every child, every day, all through the day: ""You are smart!"" Our children are starving for positive feedback and expressions of confidence in their abilities to achieve. We must anchor our children's confidence in our unwavering belief in their ability to do great things. CNN Health: Love key to brain development in children . How much better a world this would be if every child felt important. Important enough for parents to make them a priority. Important enough to know they have special gifts and talents. Important enough to have teachers and school administrators who really care. Sometimes all the edge we need to achieve great things is to know we are unique and special. I was born at time when more than a few sadly misguided black folk openly supported a black caste system based on skin color and hair texture and length -- the closer to white, the better. Although few openly promote such a system today, vestiges of that thinking remain. The ranges of skin color and hair type among black folk are from deep, rich blue-black to can't-tell-you-from-a-white-person; and hair can be short and coarse/nappy to coarse and long to straight and long and all in between. My mother and father were opposite ends of the color and hair spectrum. She was fair-skinned with a head full of hair; he was much darker with somewhat coarse hair. My sister, the first-born, entered the world with a light complexion like our mother. Her hair was long, dusty-red and very coarse. My brother, the third child, was of medium complexion with keen features like our mother. I was the middle child, features like my mother and the complexion and hair texture of my father. There I was, a dark-skinned girl child with short, nappy hair: a recipe for a hard life. But to the contrary, I live a rich and full life, have considerable professional accomplishments and most importantly, I know why. My family, understanding how skin color, hair length and texture played out in our community and beyond, made it their business to build incredible self-esteem and confidence within me. They nurtured and prepared me for a world that would not always respond to me with open and caring arms. My skin color was my skin color, and my hair texture and length were uniquely mine -- all part of a beautiful package. Neither skin color nor hair could stop me from achieving anything. There are many circumstances, things and people making our children feel they are less than and that they do not measure up. There are many things we must not tolerate from our schools. While we cannot stop the world from hurling stones of self-doubt at our children, we can fortify our children and strengthen their resolve to overcome. In our words and in our touch, we can turn the tide of low self-esteem, insecurity about competence and abilities and hatred and intolerance toward others that bubble up in too many of our young people. In whatever language used, however grammatically correct or incorrect, every child deserves to have his or her face gently held and to be told: ""You is kind. You is smart. You is important.""

"(CNN) -- Colorado Rockies pitcher Juan Nicasio had surgery Saturday after he was struck by a line drive and suffered a neck fracture, according to the team. Nicasio, injured in a frightening moment Friday night at Coors Field, was ""resting comfortably"" at a Denver hospital following surgery to stabilize a fracture to the C-1 vertebra in his neck, the Rockies said in a statement. The right-handed pitcher fell to the mound in the second inning after a ball hit by Ian Desmond of the Washington Nationals struck the right side of his head and went into foul territory. The team's staff assisted Nicasio for several minutes before he was taken off the field by a cart. He will remain hospitalized as he recovers, the Rockies said. Nicasio, 24, a native of the Dominican Republic, is 4-4 in his rookie season. He was placed on the 15-day disabled list Saturday, but it was not certain when he will be able to return.","Juan Nicasio was struck in the head by a line drive .

"(CNN) -- French-led troops in Mali now control the ancient city of Timbuktu, the city of Gao and the swath in between that was an Islamist stronghold for almost a year, the French Defense Ministry said. ""We are winning in Mali,"" French President Francois Hollande said at a news conference Monday, but he added that militants still control parts of the north. Hollande did not say how long France will maintain troops in its former colony. The country has 2,150 soldiers on Malian soil, with 1,000 more troops supporting the operation from elsewhere. The United States has also stepped up its involvement in the conflict by conducting aerial refueling missions on top of the intelligence and airlift support it was already providing. Britain said Tuesday it will provide military support but won't take part in combat. The United Kingdom is prepared to deploy up to 40 troops to a European Union military training mission in Mali, and up to 200 troops as trainers in English-speaking West African countries, British Defence Minister Philip Hammond told lawmakers in the House of Commons. In addition, the European Union said Tuesday it will contribute $67 million to support the African-led International Support Mission to Mali. The nations are joined together in an effort to prevent the Islamists from turning the once peaceful democracy into a haven for international terrorists. The Islamic extremists carved out a large portion in northern Mali last year, taking advantage of a chaotic situation after a military coup by the separatist party MNLA. They banned music, smoking, drinking and watching sports on television. They also destroyed historic tombs and shrines there. But with the French-led offensive sending the militants on the run, residents once again roamed the streets without fear. Flushing the Islamists out of Timbuktu, Mali's historic cultural center, is a big symbolic gain. Amid international outrage, the Islamists repeatedly targeted Timbuktu's ancient burial sites. They regarded such shrines as idolatrous and thus prohibited by their strict interpretation of Islam. As a column of military vehicles drove through Gao over the weekend, villagers chanted ""Mali! Mali!"" Young men on motorcycles rode alongside the convoy, wildly waving Mali's flag and euphorically praising France and freedom. Others lined the sides of the street, holding up beer bottles. They could once again drink, free from the oppressive dictates of the Islamists. The mayor of Gao returned from exile and addressed the boisterous crowd. No one could hear a word he said. But it didn't matter. He was back -- another sign that normalcy was returning. Raising money for Mali . Other countries in Africa and around the world have pledged $455 million at a donors' conference for Mali in the Ethiopian city of Addis Ababa. Among the donors, Japan pledged $120 million, the United States pledged $96 million, pending congressional approval, and the European Union pledged just over $67 million. Senegal, Nigeria and Ghana pledged $3 million each, and China and India pledged $1 million each. ""I thank you on behalf of the people of Mali,"" Malian President Dioncounda Traore said. He announced plans to hold elections on July 31. The money will support military efforts led by the African-led International Support Mission in Mali and the Malian army, the work of the Economic Organization of West African States on Mali and humanitarian assistance. U.N. gears up for returns . More than 380,000 people have fled northern Mali in the last year: 230,000 are internally displaced, and more than 150,000 refugees are in Mauritania, Niger, Burkina Faso and Algeria, the United Nations says. But now, as French and Malian forces take back ground from militants, the U.N. refugee agency is preparing for the ""possible spontaneous return of thousands of conflict-displaced people."" The agency, in a statement, reported that displaced people interviewed in the capital, Bamako, said they hoped to return soon. ""Returns are not yet a wide trend, but they are already being seen in some instances,"" the agency said. Displaced people told U.N. interviewers that they hope to return soon to areas such as Gao, Timbuktu and Kidal. U.N. officials say people are returning to Konna, which many residents fled after militants overran that city. The seizure of Konna, on January 10, prompted the French military intervention in Mali. The town is back under Mali's control. Journalists Lindsey Hilsum and Isma'il Kushkush and CNN's Joe Sterling and Richard Greene contributed to this report.","NEW: Nearly half a billion dollars pledged at donors' conference .

"(CNN) -- Congress is attempting to eviscerate women's health care. Like many women across America, I am outraged. Tomorrow, the Senate will vote on legislation proposed by Sen. Roy Blunt that would allow employers to deny coverage for health care services that are considered morally objectionable. On February 16, Republicans in the House of Representatives held a hearing designed to undermine President Barack Obama's decision to guarantee women free access to contraception health care regardless of their workplace. Fair enough. We all have the right to disagree and fight for our beliefs. But by definition, a hearing is an inquiry into many sides of an issue with testimony from various points of views. But mark this: The Republicans did not have a single woman to testify in support of the contraception mandate. That is not a hearing; that is a sham. Mitt Romney, a front-runner in the Republican primaries, has expressed support for life at conception legislation that could outlaw common forms of contraception, which would adversely affect many women. Romney has also vowed to end family planning funding that America's most financially disadvantaged women rely on for cancer screening, contraception and other basic reproductive health care needs. Voters, including Catholics, overwhelmingly support health care coverage for contraception. The truth is women use contraception not only as a way to prevent unintended pregnancies, but also to improve their health and the health of their families. Increased access to contraception is directly linked to declines in maternal and infant mortality. It can also protect women against debilitating symptoms of endometriosis and reduce the risk of ovarian cancer. But contraception isn't just a basic health care issue for women, it's also an economic issue. Today, many women pay $15 to $50 a month for contraception, even with insurance. That's as much as $600 a year, money that many American families are struggling to find. In a recent interview on MSNBC, Foster Friess, a prominent supporter of Republican presidential hopeful Rick Santorum, said, ""On this contraceptive thing, my gosh. ... You know, back in my days, they used Bayer aspirin for contraceptives. The gals put it between their knees and it wasn't that costly."" Does this man have no wife, daughter or sister? I pray that his comment, which might conceivably be pawned off as a joke if it were not so dangerous, does not represent the perspective of the people in government who have the power to determine women's health choices. But judging by some of the proposed legislation floating around, Friess is hardly alone in his view. I respectfully ask members of Congress to not be blinded by the desires of a small but vocal anti-contraception community that could put the physical and financial health of millions of American women and families on the line. Thankfully, President Obama has stood firmly behind women's health care issues by supporting coverage for contraception and reaffirming commitment to organizations like Planned Parenthood. Anyone seeking office would be wise to take heed that women are watching and we will not tolerate political rhetoric that threatens our health, safety and well-being. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Felicity Huffman.","Felicity Huffman: Congress is trying to eviscerate women's health care .

"(CNN) -- When the Mayan ""Long Count"" calendar ends on Friday, December 21, some people predict it could mark the end of the world as we know it. But despite the attention that December 21 is garnering, many apocalyptic believers don't actually give much thought to the hype surrounding the Mayan calendar. Some doomsday believers pinpointed 2012 as a pretty good year for disastrous solar flares, giant asteroids or global pole shifts that could likewise signal the apocalypse. Other theories that may or may not happen this year involve the Rapture, the catastrophic collapse of civilization or even a zombie uprising. There is diversity among apocalyptic ""prepper"" groups, and to paint them all with a broad stroke of the crazy brush is to ignore the nuances in what these various groups believe. John Hall, author of ""Apocalypse: From Antiquity to the Empire of Modernity,"" said groups organized around 2012 end-of-world predictions -- driven by pseudoscientific or numerological predictions -- are ""more fanciful"" than some other doomsday believers. That's because they look toward dramatic external events, as opposed to others that approach theories with a ""fair amount of scientific basis,"" such as the disappearance of natural resources. Read more: The apocalypse, by the numbers . Although Hall and his colleagues have spent years trying to define or connect them, the groups can be as hard to explain as their disparate beliefs. ""It's not like a pie of apocalyptic stories that can be divided up so much as it is a story where people coming from many different places can ... express the urgency of the crisis they foresee,"" Hall said. For instance, Hall said the survivalists -- both those of the fundamentalist religious persuasion and the nonreligious -- are looking to opt out of post-apocalyptic strife. That analysis applies to Dan Martin, a survivalist living off the grid and author of ""Apocalypse: How to Survive a Global Crisis,"" a book that teaches skills for living a self-sufficient life after what he perceives to be an oncoming collapse of civilization and governments. He said his readers are ""normal middle-class"" soccer moms and teachers who read about world events and ""connect the dots."" ""Most of my readers aren't die-hard, end-of-the-world subscribers or enthusiasts,"" he said. ""They don't want things to change, but aren't ignorant to the fact that they most likely will within our own lifetime, so preparing for such a strong possibility isn't desperation or ignorance or naivety, it's just another insurance policy."" Insofar as civilization's collapse is something we're bringing upon ourselves with a little help from world powers, Martin and his readers might relate to radical environmentalists or peak oil environmentalists, who subscribe to the theory that there is a date when petroleum production will max out and decline rapidly. Debunking doomsday: 6 rumors dispelled . Hall sees a connection between the survivalists and religious rapturists who ""look at themselves as missing out on the agonies of the apocalypse because they're going someplace else."" Jerry Jenkins, co-author of the ""Left Behind"" book series about the Rapture within the Christian Bible's end-of-days Book of Revelation, doesn't completely agree with Hall's assessment. He said the media has incorrectly portrayed his readers as triumphalists who boast ""We're going, you're not, too bad for you."" The whole point of the ""Left Behind"" books, Jenkins said, was to encourage people to read the Revelation prophecies because religious rapturists want all people to have a better life in heaven. ""[We're not] saying 'good' people go and 'bad' people are left behind,"" said Jenkins, who believes the key to being raptured (or taken into heaven before the Apocalypse happens on Earth) is to receive Jesus Christ. But Jenkins added that even those ""looking forward to being rescued"" are still dedicated to improving life for everyone on terra firma before they go. Interestingly, Jenkins said Christ himself said he didn't even know the day or hour of the Rapture, so the ilk of Christian radio broadcaster Harold Camping who attempt to predict its timing are ""crazies"" engaged in folly that ""make us all look like idiots."" Camping claimed he was able to use the Bible to calculate the exact date of the Rapture (most recently it was supposed to be May 23, 2011, and before that in 1994). Those who point to science instead of Biblical lore to predict the end of the world are another apocalyptic subculture, according to Hall. These groups are comprised of theoretical physicists and futurologists -- such as Michio Kaku -- whom Hall calls ""optimistic utopian prophets."" These people believe in the Technological Singularity theory: The possibility that technologically augmented intelligence will change human life as we know it or possibly wipe it out completely. There's even a think tank of sorts formed around this logic. The Singularity Institute is comprised of scientists, philosophers and philanthropists from places such as the Research Triangle and Silicon Valley, and universities such as Harvard and Stanford, said Michael Anissimov, media director at The Singularity Institute. Their goal? Constructing a smarter-than-human intelligence that has the values of humanity. Instead of avoiding the growth of artificial intelligence, the Singularity Institute is trying to manage the risk. If peak oil theorists believe we're rapidly running out of a major resource, the institute postulates that technology itself is advancing so rapidly that society will have an overabundance of it -- and an artificial intelligence is set to emerge that will not necessarily pursue mankind's best interests. ""We do think it's possible, if not probable, that it could actually lead to either the marginalization or end of humanity,"" said Anissimov. Doomsday dining: Your last meal . Whereas religious and scientific apocalyptic subcultures converge and diverge on various points, there is one end-of-world scenario that manages to reflect all their anxieties: the zombie apocalypse. The zombocalypse of popular culture has become something of a Rorschach test of apocalyptic fears. Depending on the point of view, zombies may result from an act of God, the irresponsible use of science, an environmental disaster, a cosmic event and so forth. Scott Kenemore, author of ""The Zen of Zombie"" and a member of the advisory board of the Zombie Research Society, said the zombie apocalypse can represent a validation of sorts for people awaiting their particular extinction event. Hall agreed that the pop-culture connection of zombies to apocalyptic groups is ""a shared motif of a dystopian world emerging."" He added that zombies are a stand-in for ""The Other,"" an alien group, process or force that is ""almost always"" the basis for apocalyptic developments. Zombies can be a substitute for a corrupt government, an oil-based economy, foreigners or even a Sodom and Gomorrah society itself. ""[H]ow you deal with the threat is an open question,"" he said. Whatever route to the end (or new beginning), Hall thinks the very diversity of subcultures underscores the fact that we have reached an apocalyptic apex. ""In this moment, people are seeing the old ways of life recede,"" he said. ""That's the occasion when all kinds of different people from all kinds of different directions come forward with one or another apocalyptic scenario."" Like CNN Living on Facebook .

"(CNN) -- FBI agents on Friday night searched the Maryland home of the suspect in the recent disappearance of an American woman in Aruba, an agent said. The search is occurring in the Gaithersburg residence of Gary Giordano, who is currently being held in an Aruban jail, FBI Special Agent Rich Wolf told CNN. Agents, wearing vests that said FBI and carrying empty cardboard and plastic boxes, arrived about 8:40 p.m. Friday. About 15 unmarked cars could be seen on the street, as well as a Montgomery County police vehicle. Supervisory Special Agent Philip Celestini, who was at the residence, declined to comment further on the search, citing the active investigation. Aruban Solicitor General Taco Stein said earlier Friday that the suspect will appear in court Monday, where an investigating magistrate could order him held for at least eight more days, order him to remain on the island or release him outright due to a lack of evidence. Giordano was arrested by Aruban police on August 5, three days after Robyn Gardner was last seen near Baby Beach on the western tip of the Caribbean island. Giordano told authorities that he had been snorkeling with Gardner when he signaled to her to swim back, according to a statement. When he reached the beach, Gardner was nowhere to be found, Giordano allegedly said. The area that Giordano led authorities to is a rocky, unsightly location that locals say is not a popular snorkeling spot. Although prosecutors have continued to identify the 50-year-old American man by his initials, GVG, they also released a photo of a man who appears to be Giordano. His attorney, Michael Lopez, also has said that his client is being held as a suspect in Gardner's death. Lopez has not returned telephone calls seeking comment. Giordano is no longer cooperating with authorities in the investigation, Stein has said. Authorities are concerned for Gardner's welfare because she has not stepped forward despite all the publicity surrounding the case, Stein said. But they have no evidence that she is dead, he said. Although officials have stopped actively searching for Gardner, they are continuing to seek evidence in the case, Stein said. Police are gathering and reviewing closed-circuit video feeds from hotels and other locations where the two were known to have been, but those materials are still being compiled and analyzed, he said. Investigators also examined Giordano's rental car but were unable to find any clues to Gardner's disappearance, Stein said. That could be because the rental-car company washed and vacuumed the vehicle before police had a chance to examine it, Stein said. The FBI is assisting in the investigation, an agency spokesman confirmed Thursday. Among other things, agents will conduct interviews in Maryland, where Gardner lives, said Richard Wolf, a spokesman for the FBI's Baltimore office. According to Aruban prosecutors, the missing woman and the suspect arrived July 31 from the United States. Gardner's friend Christina Jones told HLN's Nancy Grace that the woman had known Giordano for more than a year and flew to Aruba with him. Jones said she had some concerns about the trip, but Gardner ""calmed me and said it was OK, that the trip to Aruba was what she needed."" Lopez, Giordano's attorney, said Tuesday that his client came to Aruba on vacation with a female friend he had met on a dating site and has known for years. Lopez earlier said that his client had been cooperating with police. Lopez said that on his client's last scheduled day in Aruba, he asked authorities whether he needed to stay. ""They didn't answer it, and on his way to the airport, they detained him as a suspect for murder,"" Lopez said. The Aruban prosecutors office has declined to say what evidence led authorities to suspect Giordano's involvement in Gardner's disappearance. Richard Forester of Maryland said he and Gardner have been dating for the past seven or eight months. He told HLN's Nancy Grace on Wednesday evening that Gardner wasn't the type to go into deep water, and she would more likely stay by the pool. ""It's just not her to go out and snorkel,"" Forester said. Forester said Tuesday that before Gardner's trip, the two argued over ""the circumstances of her travel"" to Aruba. He last heard from her August 2 in a Facebook message, in which she said they would ""work it out"" when she got back. Earlier that day, Forester said, Gardner posted on her Facebook wall ""this sucks,"" with no further explanation. She was scheduled to return to the United States on August 4, Forester said. In an interview with HLN's Jane Velez-Mitchell on Thursday -- the same day he was interviewed by authorities -- Forester described Gardner as a woman who ""loved life."" ""She loved to be happy, loved to have fun, loved to be active,"" he said. ""She had a very loving, warm heart.""

"United Nations (CNN) -- The United Nations Security Council on Thursday authorized a military peacekeeping mission in Mali to help the once-stable country retake its vast northern region from Islamist rebels. The council authorized the deployment of an African-led International Support Mission in Mali for an initial period of one year. The mission aims to help rebuild the capacity of Mali's security and defense forces and to help the Malian authorities recover the areas in the north. A regional group, the Economic Community of West African States, already pledged thousands of troops to the mission, and the Security Council urged other member states to contribute troops. The new U.N. mission is also tasked with helping Mali reduce the threat posed by terrorist groups, including al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and the Movement of Unity and Jihad in Western Africa. The two groups now control two thirds of northern Mali, an area the size of France. Mali names new prime minister in abrupt change of leadership . Mali held its first democratic elections in 1992 after decades of military rule. It had a mostly strong democracy until this year, when a group of soldiers toppled the government, saying it had not provided adequate equipment for them to fight ethnic Tuareg rebels roaming the vast desert in the north. The Tuareg rebels, who staged decades of rebellions in their desire for independence, took advantage of the power vacuum and seized parts of the north. The rebels were well armed; they had fought alongside Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi, and when he was killed in October 2011, they returned to Mali with weapons. A power struggle then erupted in the north between the Tuaregs and local al Qaeda-linked radicals who prevailed and seized control of large parts of the desert north. The international community voiced concerns about al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and expanding its presence in Mali. The al Qaeda wing is linked to the deadly attack in Benghazi, Libya, that killed the U.S. ambassador to Libya and three others, U.S. officials have said. Thursday's Security Council resolution also calls on Malian authorities to restore constitutional order and national unity, and to hold peaceful, credible and inclusive elections by April at the latest. ECOWAS appointed an interim president in April 2012 after reaching a deal with the coup leader. Last week, U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon voiced new concerns about the political situation in Mali when soldiers loyal to the coup leader arrested interim Prime Minister Cheick Modibo Diarra in unclear circumstances, and Diarra resigned. ECOWAS expressed concern about military interference in the political process. The militants in the north have already applied their strict interpretation of Sharia law by banning music, smoking, drinking and watching sports on television. They also publicly stoned a couple to death in July for reportedly having an affair. Public executions, amputations, floggings and other inhumane punishments are becoming common, the United Nations says. At least four times this year, the militants have attacked Timbuktu's historic tombs and shrines, claiming the relics are idolatrous. The picturesque city was once an important destination for Islamic scholars for its ancient and prominent burial sites and is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Tuareg rebels retreated from the well-armed militants but have vowed to fight back and establish their own country in the north, which they call Azawad. West African states and international leaders say a rapid military intervention is essential to solving the security crisis. Challenges persist in confronting growing threat of al Qaeda in Mali .","UN-sanctioned peacekeepers will be deployed for an initial period of one year .

"(CNN) -- Syria's tanks withdrew Wednesday from the center of the western city of Hama and were positioned on the city's periphery, more than a week after security forces besieged the center of anti-government sentiment, an activist said. Syrian army units left central Hama ""after restoring the security and stability to the city that have been through tough times due to the acts of killings, terrorizing and sabotage that were done by the armed terrorists groups,"" the state-run Syrian Arab News Agency (SANA) said Wednesday. An officer in the army told journalists that the soldiers had returned to their bases. This came as violence erupted in other towns and amid a growing chorus of international calls for Syria's government to end its brutal drive on peaceful protesters. The Local Coordination Committees of Syria, a loose coalition of groups that organize and document protests in Syria, put Wednesday's death toll at 22 -- 18 in Homs and one each in Hama, Nawa, Taftanaz/Idlib province and the Damascus suburbs. In Hama, an activist put the death toll at two. Scores of deaths have been reported in Hama during the siege by government forces that coincided with last week's start of the holy month of Ramadan. An activist said the military and government enforcers were stopping and searching cars and security forces were arresting people in farms outside the city, where many activists have been hiding out. Most of the city's shops were closed, the activist said. Though some hospitals have reopened, they were short of supplies, the activist said. The activist said that after Wednesday night prayers, the demonstrators took to the streets in the southern part of the city. They were met by gunfire from security forces, who killed two people, the activist said. A YouTube video showed what was described as a march by several dozen demonstrators in Hama on Wednesday night. Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu said Wednesday that Turkey's envoy to Syria, Omer Onhon, had visited Hama and confirmed that tanks and heavy weapons were withdrawn and there was no military buildup ""in its surroundings."" ""He visited all of the area and went to all the streets. He prayed with the people at the big mosque there,"" Davutoglu said of Onhon. Davutoglu had met Tuesday with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to try to persuade him to end the violence in Syria. Speaking to reporters in the Turkish capital of Ankara, Davutoglu said that, despite the withdrawal, ""it is also understood that the city does not have enough vibrancy either."" Al-Assad said the government would continue to hunt down ""armed gangs,"" the people whom the government has consistently blamed for the violence. But he also said he was open to reforms. ""If civilian losses continue, it won't be possible to reach the desired outcome,"" Davutoglu said, adding that he hoped more steps would be taken in coming days to ease the crisis. Davutoglu said that it is important for places like Hama to be opened to reporters, whose access to Syria has been severely restricted. The U.N. Security Council met Wednesday in closed session to follow up on the statement it issued last week condemning the Syrian regime for attacks on peaceful protesters and calling for both sides to end the violence. ""We are very disappointed to learn that there is no clear sign that they are hearing the message of the international community,"" said Germany's deputy ambassador to the world body, Miguel Berger, after the meeting. ""We can only hope that the Syrian authorities understand. They need to stop the killings now."" The members agreed to meet again on Syria, said Britain's deputy ambassador to the United Nations, Phil Parham. A day after the Syrian-Turkish meeting, Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Moallem briefed envoys of South Africa, Brazil and India on the crisis and the ""killing and sabotage acts committed by armed groups,"" SANA reported. Those countries are nonpermanent members of the U.N. Security Council and are among the entities working to defuse the Syrian crisis. According to the envoy delegation, al-Assad acknowledged ""that some mistakes had been made by the security forces in the initial stages of the unrest and that efforts were under way to prevent their recurrence."" Moallem told them that the opposition comprised economically disadvantaged people, intellectuals, academics and armed groups, the envoys said in a statement. The United States, meanwhile, slapped sanctions on Syria's largest mobile phone operator and a Syrian bank and its Lebanese subsidiary. The U.S. Treasury Department on Wednesday announced the designation of mobile phone operator Syriatel, the Commercial Bank of Syria and the Syrian Lebanese Commercial Bank. It said Americans are ""generally prohibited from engaging in commercial or financial transactions"" with the companies. While international leaders mull their next steps, the sound of gunfire, explosions and tanks permeated the eastern city of Deir Ezzor on Wednesday, an activist group and a resident said. A videotape posted on YouTube showed the Othman Bin Affan Mosque being shelled. Activists told CNN the shelling of the Sunni mosque came from Syrian forces, but CNN was not able to confirm that. Though Syria is majority Sunni, its leadership tends to belong to the Alawite sect. Businesses and homes belonging to opposition organizers were destroyed, said the resident, who did not want to be identified for safety reasons. ""There are also large-scale arrests in those areas as mobile service and landline communications have been completely cut out in the areas since the start of the military operation"" Wednesday morning, the London-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said in a statement. Security forces also focused attention on Idlib province, in the northwest. The observatory said gunfire from security forces killed one woman and wounded three people in Sirmeen. Security forces killed an activist in Taftanaz, the observatory said. The forces seized more than 300 detainees in a day in Binnish, Taftanaz, Sirmeen and Taoum, according to the observatory. The conflict in Syria was fueled five months ago when Syrian forces suppressed protests in the southern city of Daraa. Anti-government fervor caught on nationwide as more protests were met with tougher crackdowns. While activists blame government security forces for the casualties, the al-Assad regime has consistently said ""armed groups"" are responsible. By Wednesday, the death toll had reached 2,417 -- including more than 2,000 civilians, said the Local Coordination Committees of Syria. The number includes 84 deaths in the city of Deir Ezzor alone since Saturday, when pro-government forces began a military campaign in the area, the LCC said. Another 13,000 people remain detained, Britain's Deputy Ambassador Parham said. Because of restrictions on international journalists' access to the country, CNN is unable to independently confirm details of the situation. CNN's Amir Ahmed, John King, Elise Labott, Arwa Damon, Nada Husseini and Yesim Comert contributed to this report.","NEW: Coalition cites 22 deaths on Wednesday .

"(CNN) -- On a quiet August day I lost someone I loved very much. Her name was Joan and she was a mother to me for 15 years. Her death was sudden and unexpected, and there were still so many things she wanted to do: Learn to play the piano, live in Paris, see the Pacific Ocean. I spent a long time full of grief, and then I felt gratitude for the time we had together. I thought about death a lot, which brought clarity to my life, the people I want to be with, and the things I want to do. But I struggled to maintain this perspective. It's easy to get caught up in the day-to-day and forget what really matters to you. I wondered if other people felt the same way. Over the past few years I've tried ways to share more with my neighbors in public space, using simple tools like stickers, stencils, and chalk. This time I wanted to know what was important to the people around me and I wanted a daily reminder to restore perspective. So with help from old and new friends, I transformed the side of an abandoned house in my neighborhood in New Orleans into a giant chalkboard and stenciled it with a grid of the fill-in-the-blank sentence ""Before I die I want to _______."" Anyone walking by could pick up a piece of chalk, reflect on their lives, and share their personal aspirations in public space. It was all an experiment and I didn't know what to expect. By the next day the wall was entirely filled out and it kept growing: Before I die I want to ... sing for millions, see my daughter graduate, eat all the candy and sushi in the world, straddle the International Date Line, be someone's cavalry, live off the grid, build a school, hold her one more time, abandon all insecurities, be completely myself ... TED.com: Artfully visualizing our humanity . People's responses made me laugh out loud, tear up, and they consoled me during my own tough times. This neglected space became a constructive one where we understood our neighbors in new and enlightening ways. It also showed us we are not alone in our hopes, fears and struggles as we try to lead fulfilling lives. After receiving requests from passionate people around the world, my Civic Center colleagues and I created a toolkit and project site to help people make a wall with their community. You can also download all files for free to remix or create your own stencils. Now over 75 Before I Die walls have been created in over 10 languages and in over 25 countries, including Kazakhstan, Argentina, China, Denmark, and South Africa. Each wall is unique and reflects the people of that community, and each wall is a tribute to living an examined life. And by using a few simple tools like chalkboard paint and chalk, this project shows you don't need a big budget to make a big impact. TED.com: Architecture that senses and responds . Death is something we're often discouraged to talk about or even think about: Don't go there. It's too sad. You don't need to think about it until you're older. However, regularly contemplating deathÃ¢â¬âas Stoicism and other philosophies encourageÃ¢â¬âis a powerful and healthy tool to put daily stresses in their place, re-appreciate the present, and remember what matters most to you. Thinking about death clarifies your life. In our age of increasing distractions, it's important to find ways to step back, pause, and reflect on our experiences so we make the most of our brief and tender lives. It's not our experiences that define us but what we make of our experiences that defines us as we grow and change. TED.com: Three warp-speed architecture tales . Our public spaces are as profound as we allow them to be.

How can our public spaces nourish our well-being and better reflect what matters to us as a community and as individuals? Every passerby is another person full of longing, anxiety, fear, wonder, and wisdom, and there is great power in knowing you are not alone. With more ways to share in public space, the people around us can not only help us make better places, they can help us become our best selves.

"Yangon (Financial Times) -- Myanmar passed a milestone in its efforts to clear its foreign debts after announcing agreements with the Paris Club of creditors, the World Bank, and the Asian Development Bank. The deals announced Sunday mean that Myanmar has now cleared the bulk of its $11.3bn in outstanding foreign debts. Resolving the debts, which the government stopped servicing in the 1980s, is seen as a crucial step in the country's efforts to re-engage with international donors. The World Bank and the ADB said their boards had agreed to clear Myanmar's arrears of a combined $960m using bridge loans from the Japan Bank for International Cooperation. The moves funded by Tokyo followed Japan's unilateral decision to settle nearly $6.6bn in bilateral debt and a subsequent move by Norway to clear some $600m in debt. The Paris Club agreement, to cancel at least 50 per cent of a further $4.4bn in bilateral debt, will meanwhile enable Myanmar to start negotiations with nine creditor countries on repayment terms. Myanmar, which has promised a series of rapid political and economic reforms under President Thein Sein, has made clearing its debts a priority. But there are concerns among some diplomats that the debt deals could prompt further criticism of the Myanmar military's escalating attacks on northern ethnic Kachin rebels. In recent weeks, the United Nations, the US and the European Union have all urged an end to the fighting, and some western politicians and officials have warned that further conflict could endanger aid plans for Myanmar. The most significant breakthrough in terms of Myanmar's remaining debt to creditor countries came after an intense 19-hour negotiating session between Myanmar and the Paris Club group of creditor countries in Paris late last week. The Paris Club is an informal group of creditor countries that consult regularly on issues including loan restructuring and debt cancellation, particularly for heavily indebted poor countries. Myanmar owed about $4.4bn to nine Paris Club countries including the UK, Germany, France, Denmark and the Netherlands. Under Paris Club rules, a debtor country must first clear its arrears with international financial institutions before it can negotiate with creditor countries. ""It was a very tough negotiation, but Myanmar got a good, in some respects exceptional, agreement -- this has really opened a new era for us,"" said Zaw Oo, a leading Myanmar economist who was part of the negotiating team in Paris. The government has high hopes for more leniency from creditors following the Paris Club talks, he noted. ""Japan and Norway's moves were vital in helping the Paris Club reach a relatively quick agreement, but the international financial institutions were crucial in convincing creditors that our reforms are genuine and are proceeding,"" he said, noting that such a move would normally have required a formal IMF programme. ""Myanmar has come a long way in its economic transformation"" and the debt deals should help attract investment, spur growth and create jobs, said Annette Dixon, the World Bank's country director, though she warned ""much work remains to be done"". In its most recent assessment, the World Bank said Myanmar's economic growth accelerated to 5.5 per cent in fiscal year 2011-12 and is expected to reach 6.3 per cent in 2012-13.

""Look how good he moves that camera, you son of a gun. Wherever I go, he goes,"" said Lewis, 81.

"Washington (CNN) -- In a move likely to reignite the political battle over judges, President Barack Obama on Thursday renominated 33 people to the federal courts, including a New York lawyer twice blocked by Republicans worried she would be an ""activist"" on the bench. Caitlin Halligan was one of two nominees named again by Obama to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, seen by many as a professional steppingstone to the Supreme Court. Halligan is currently general counsel for the Manhattan District Attorney's Office in New York. She would fill the seat vacated by John Roberts, who joined the Supreme Court as chief justice in 2005. In his announcement, Obama said his nominees should have been given up-or-down Senate votes before the 112th Congress adjourned. ""Several have been awaiting a vote for more than six months, even though they all enjoy bipartisan support. I continue to be grateful for their willingness to serve and remain confident that they will apply the law with the utmost impartiality and integrity,"" he said. ""I urge the Senate to consider and confirm these nominees without delay, so all Americans can have equal and timely access to justice."" By law, the president must resubmit nominations that did not receive floor action in the previous session of Congress. Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy, D-Vermont, last week urged Republicans not to stop Obama's pending nominations. ""There are more judicial vacancies now - 75 - than when President Obama was sworn into office four years ago,"" said Leahy. ""The nominations of too many qualified judicial nominees have needlessly languished on the Senate calendar."" Chief Justice laments 'fiscal cliff' effects on federal courts . In a rare move, Senate Republicans voted in December 2011 to block Halligan the first time she was tapped for the court, complaining the 46-year-old Ohio native was too liberal and would be an activist on the bench. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell said at the time that Halligan met the ""extraordinary circumstances"" standard for a filibuster under a 2005 Senate agreement that allowed filibusters of judicial nominees only in extreme cases. McConnell complained about Halligan's legal positions on gun rights, detainee rights, and immigration and said she would bring an activist agenda to the court. Democrats had defended Halligan as a ""superbly qualified nominee,"" in the words of Leahy. Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-New York, called her a moderate and said Republicans have distorted her record. Halligan's 2012 renomination languished without action, typical of an election year, when confirmations for a variety of political and practical reasons are given a lower legislative priority. Also renominated for the D.C. Circuit is Sri Srinivasan, the principal deputy solicitor general at the Justice Department, who has argued more than 20 cases before the Supreme Court. He would be the appeals court's first Asian-American, if confirmed. Republicans had been criticized for delaying floor votes on many nominees in the president's first term in office. But the White House, too, has come under fire for not moving quickly to fill growing bench vacancies. Some moderates from both parties have long lamented threats of delays and filibuster attempts of most presidential appointments. They say ongoing vacancies have created a crisis in many federal courts, with bulging dockets being handled by too few judges.","Nominees include one whose selection was blocked twice already in Senate .

"(CNN) -- The Doha climate change conference this year was the most significant in nearly 20 years of gatherings under the U.N. Framework Convention process aimed at staving off future global warming disaster. Since carbon dioxide emission limits agreed to under the 1997 Kyoto Protocol were to expire at the stroke of midnight on December 31, 2012, it was critical that the international community agreed to extend those obligations and to continue talks about future emission cuts. But the outcome fell far short of what will be necessary to keep the world's average temperature from rising more than 2 degrees Celsius in the foreseeable future. Under the Doha arrangement, 17 of the 25 biggest carbon emitting countries (including China, the United States, Russia and India) did not commit to any legally binding emission limits. The countries that did agree to extend and deepen their Kyoto emission reductions, including the European Union, Australia and Eastern Europe, make up only about 15% of the world's emissions. That seems like a rather meager return on the investment of time and effort over the past years. But there is one silver lining. The world's top 20 carbon emitters together make up about 77% of emission and account for about 4.3 billion people, which is about 62% of the global population. The remaining 170 or so countries account for just over 20% of emissions. As often is the case, these negotiations over climate have come to symbolize epic David and Goliath struggles pitting poor developing countries against recalcitrant government officials from rich countries. Lobbying efforts, shaming tactics, and staging public demonstrations have been the slingshots of choice. One result is that more people are paying attention to environmental issues. Nonetheless, it is time to abandon the myth that a consensus solution is necessarily the best approach. The unfortunate reality is that little can get done right now. It's like having hundreds of cooks with hundreds of different recipes attempting to prepare one meal in the same small kitchen. After two decades of hard work, it is time to consider reducing the number of cooks. A better alternative to a United Nations-style conference would be for the 25 major emitters to come to an agreement just among themselves about their mutual commitments to deal with climate change effectively. In other words, get the 25 cooks to work together on the main meal. The hundreds of other cooks ought to step out of the kitchen. Some smaller, focused discussions have already started, such as in the Major Economies Forum. Imagine what kind of deals on cutting emissions would be possible just among China, India and the United States -- the top three emitters in the world respectively. Imagine a deal involving emission sources in China, which has some of the world's most polluting coal-fired power plants, and California, which is on a course to become one of the most stringently controlled states in carbon emissions. Of course, there are no guarantees for success. But discussions within such a smaller group would allow government leaders to confront the realities of climate change and engage in direct horse-trading without the static of thousands of other voices desiring to load their issues into the deal. Let's face it -- we are way beyond the time for finding an ideal solution. Every year the world waits to take further concrete steps to cut emissions, the atmosphere will be loaded with millions of tons more carbon dioxide that will stay for a century. And the job of limiting global warming to 2 degrees Celsius will be more out of reach. At the best, gatherings like the one in Doha dangle a tantalizing mirage of achieving a sustainable future. At the worst, they give cover to governments that would rather avoid the hard choices they ultimately will have to make. After one more expensive and time-consuming round of talks, it's time to be honest with what can really be accomplished in these U.N.-style gatherings. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Tseming Yang.","Tseming Yang: Result of Doha climate change conference less than desirable .

"ASPEN, Colorado (CNN) -- A man delivered bombs wrapped as Christmas presents to two banks Wednesday along with a note threatening ""mass death"" if they did not turn over tens of thousands of dollars, police in Aspen, Colorado, said Thursday. A surveillance camera photo supplied by Aspen police shows the man identified as James Blanning. Authorities were quickly alerted, and the man apparently halted his plan, leaving two bombs that were intended for other banks in an alley, police said. ""You had better be a very cool individual and not start a panic or many in Aspen will pay a horrible price in blood,"" said the note, which was released by police. The man, identified as James Blanning, 72, who had had previous run-ins with law enforcement, was later found dead after apparently shooting himself, police said.  Watch how the situation unfolded Â» . His body was found in his car in a rural area east of Aspen. ""At this point, we believe Blanning was acting alone,"" Aspen Assistant Police Chief Bill Linn said Thursday. Authorities ordered the evacuation of a 16-block area of Aspen on New Year's Eve, one of the busiest nights of the year for the resort town, after the bombs were found. Linn said that it is impossible to calculate how much revenue businesses in the area lost on New Year's Eve because of the bomb scare but that it was easily ""in the millions."" Bomb squads ultimately detonated the devices, and no one was injured. Linn praised the banks for their ""clearheaded response"" in immediately alerting authorities on Wednesday. The calls to police came about 2:30 p.m. Wednesday. Blanning had delivered ""large plastic tubs"" containing ""wrapped Christmas-style presents"" along with a threatening note to a Wells Fargo Bank branch and a Vectra Bank branch, police said.  Watch how notes threatened destruction Â» . Repeatedly using the word ""we,"" as though a group of people was behind the plot, the obscenity-filled note described a bomb filled with ""unique chemicals and electronics"" and demanded that $60,000 in hundred-dollar bills be handed over in 20 minutes outside the bank. The note also refers to the Iraq war and describes President Bush as ""Rove's and Chaney's [sic] monkey.""  Read note police say was left by suspected bomber Â» . ""This is as much a suicide mission as a bank robbery,"" the note said. The devices in the alley were first to be detonated, Linn said. ""They were found to contain improvised incendiary devices made of gasoline and containing what appeared to be cell phone actuators and anti-tamper devices,"" he said. Authorities couldn't determine whether the bombs would have worked. When one bomb was detonated at Wells Fargo Bank, it triggered a fireball that was quickly extinguished, but authorities don't know whether that was the result of the detonation or the device itself activating, Linn said. When Blanning's body was found in his vehicle, he had ""at least a rifle"" with him, and may have had other weapons as well, Linn said. Authorities say the man also delivered a hand-written note to the Aspen Times. A copy of the note showed a 10-line printed scrawl that included the words ""Will & Testament"" and ""2 crime scenes"" with two apparent addresses of apartments in Denver. ""For the first two years I was in prison I woke up every morning wishing I was dead. Now it comes to pass. I was and am a good man,"" the note begins. Public records show that Blanning was convicted of several crimes, including forgery and theft, in 1996 in Rio Blanco County in northwest Colorado. His sentence was scheduled to end in 2009, but he was out of prison on parole. In 1994, the Rocky Mountain News published a story about Blanning, then 58. ""An embittered man with a rope around his neck held off authorities from a perch on the roof of the Pitkin County Courthouse in Aspen for seven hours Thursday,"" the story said. Blanning ultimately surrendered in that incident, according to authorities quoted in that story. CNN left a phone message at a Denver address for Blanning found via a public records search. The call, which sought comment from a representative for him, was not immediately returned. No public statement has been made on Blanning's behalf. Substantial business was lost Wednesday evening, according to a report in the Rocky Mountain News.  Watch a ""surreal situation"" in Aspen Â» . ""This has got to be the worst for us. ... Outside the Fourth of July, this is the cash cow of all cash cows,"" the newspaper quoted the on-call manager of the Molly Gibson Lodge in Aspen as saying. ""Most of the restaurants are going to be terribly hurt."" ""People are losing so much money, it's crazy,"" Monique Wagner, front desk clerk at the Hyatt Grand Hotel, told the newspaper.","NEW: Man delivered note that mentions ""Will & Testament,"" ""2 crime scenes""

"(CNN) -- Can a movie actually convince you to support torture? Can a movie really persuade you that ""fracking"" -- a process used to drill for natural gas -- is a danger to the environment? Can a movie truly cause you to view certain minority groups in a negative light? Some scoff at the notion that movies do anything more than entertain. They are wrong. Sure, it's unlikely that one movie alone will change your views on issues of magnitude. But a movie (or TV show) can begin your ""education"" or ""miseducation"" on a topic. And for those already agreeing with the film's thesis, it can further entrench your views. Anyone who doubts the potential influence that movies can have on public opinion need to look no further than two films that are causing an uproar even before they have opened nationwide. They present hot button issues that manage to fire up people from the left and right. The first, ""Zero Dark Thirty,"" is about the pursuit and killing of Osama bin Laden, which features scenes of torture. The second, ""Promised Land,"" stars Matt Damon and explores how the use of fracking to drill for natural gas can pose health and environmental dangers. Critics of ""Zero Dark Thirty"" fear that audiences will accept as true the film's story line that torture was effective in eliciting information to locate bin Laden. They are rightfully concerned that the film will sway some to become more receptive or even supportive of the idea of torturing prisoners. Peter Bergen: Did torture really net bin Laden? Opposition to the film escalated last week as three senior U.S. senators -- John McCain, Carl Levin and Dianne Feinstein -- sent a letter to the film's distributor, Sony Pictures, characterizing the film's use of torture as ""grossly inaccurate and misleading."" The senators bluntly informed Sony Pictures that it has ""an obligation to state that the role of torture in the hunt for Osama bin Laden is not based on the facts, but rather part of the film's fictional narrative."" The hostility toward ""Promised Land"" shows us that it's not just politicians who complain about movie messages. Big business -- namely, the gas industry -- is aggressively objecting to the allegation in ""Promised Land"" that fracking poses environmental and health risks. How concerned is the gas industry? It has set up a rapid response team to counter publicity for the film by using two Washington-based groups that lobby for gas and oil companies: the Independent Petroleum Association of America and Energy in Depth. These groups have scrutinized appearances by the films stars on talk shows, questioned who the financiers of the film are, published parts of the script and mocked the film on social media. Energy in Depth went as far as to ""fact check"" a recent appearance by the film's co-star and co-writer, John Krasinski, on ""Late Night With David Letterman."" Within hours of Krasinski's appearance, Energy in Depth posted a blog on its website pointing out what it perceived as factual errors made by Krasinski about fracking. Regardless of whether ""Zero Dark Thirty"" and ""Promised Land"" intended to promote any message, people who watch them will be ""educated"" in some way on torture and fracking -- even if very subtly. This is the same reason that minority groups continue to object to being represented in a negative light in movies and TV. They understand that accurate representations matter because studies have shown that biases can form based on stereotypes or inaccurate representations. (Being of Italian and Arab descent, I'm acutely aware of this issue as my respective heritages have been represented by a parade of mobsters and terrorists.) What's Hollywood's role in all of this? The same as it has always been -- to make money. In fact, there's no doubt that the studios behind these movies are overjoyed at the controversy that has erupted and the resulting free press. Indeed, the response of Sony Pictures to the uproar over ""Zero Dark Thirty"" tells you about what they really hope we will all do: ""We encourage people to see the film before characterizing it."" So go ahead, enjoy these films and ones like them that are based on actual events or current hot issues. But while you are watching them, be aware you might be getting more than the price of ticket. You might also be getting a (mis)education. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Dean Obeidallah.","Dean Obeidallah: A movie or TV show can educate or (mis)educate you .

"(CNN) -- The owner of a Houston day care where four small children perished in a fire will face four counts of murder in those deaths, court records showed Thursday. Jessica Tata had previously been charged with six counts of reckless injury to a child and several charges of manslaughter. She will be in court to face the new charges on Friday. Tata, who has dual citizenship in the United States and Nigeria, fled to the African nation shortly after the fatal fire at her Houston home in February. She was taken into custody almost a month later in Port Harcourt, Nigeria, by Interpol and U.S. diplomatic security agents, officials said. Tata's first stop on her return to the United States was Atlanta, where she was booked into the Fulton County Jail. After waiving her extradition rights during an appearance in magistrate court, Tata was transported to the Harris County Jail in Texas. Investigators allege that Tata, 22, left seven children alone at her Houston day care center with the stove on while she went to a store. Four children died, and three others were injured in the fire. U.S. Marshals joined the search after Harris County authorities determined that Tata had left the Houston area. They added her their 15 Most Wanted Fugitives list in early March. CNN's Antoinette Campbell contributed to this report.","Jessica Tata is currently at a Houston-area jail .

"Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama spoke separately Friday with Speaker John Boehner and the top Senate Democrat to try to salvage a fiscal cliff deal by the end of year, after Republican disarray in the U.S. House put the negotiations in limbo. In a previously unscheduled statement to reporters, Obama outlined a possible agreement that he said would include protecting middle-class Americans from a tax hike, extending unemployment benefits and setting a framework for future deficit reduction steps. He called on Congress to pass the agreement after a Christmas break so he can sign it before the end of the year, when the fiscal cliff arrives in the form of automatic tax increases and deep spending cuts. ""Laws can only pass with support from Democrats and Republicans,"" Obama said in urging both sides to compromise. The president planned to fly with his family to Hawaii on Friday night for the holiday and return to Washington after Christmas, while House and Senate members also headed home with plans to return on December 27 if needed. Boehner's spokesman said the speaker will be ""ready to find a solution that can pass both houses of Congress"" when he returns to Washington. What failure on fiscal deal means for troubled Boehner . While congressional leaders continued to bicker Friday over the next step, the president's phone discussion with Boehner and a White House meeting with Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid signaled an attempt to provide the nation and investors with hope that an agreement can be reached. An aide to Reid said the short-term proposal to avoid the fiscal cliff should include extending tax cuts for middle-class families and unemployment insurance while delaying the automatic spending cuts set to take effect in the new year. Obama acknowledged what had become obvious: the broader deficit reduction deal he seeks will likely come in stages, rather than in the so-called grand bargain he and Boehner have been negotiating. The main issue of disagreement continued to be taxes, specifically whether rates should go up on top income brackets for the wealthiest Americans as part of an agreement to reduce the nation's chronic federal deficits and debt. Without a deal, the fiscal cliff could trigger a recession, economists warn. Stocks closed down sharply on Friday over the latest impasse in the deficit talks, a sign of investor fears of a slowdown as the nation slowly continued to emerge from recession. Before leaving town, Boehner puts fiscal cliff onus on Obama . Earlier Friday, Reid called for House Republicans to quickly approve a Senate plan championed by Obama that would extend tax cuts for family income up to $250,000 while allowing rates to return to higher levels of the 1990s above that threshold. His Republican counterpart, Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, responded that the Senate should instead take up a House Republican measure extending the tax cuts for everyone as a temporary move before negotiations next year on broader tax reform. The GOP revulsion over any kind of tax rate increase has stymied deficit negotiations for two years and led to unusual political drama, such as McConnell recently filibustering his own proposal and Thursday night's rebuff by House Republicans of an alternative tax plan pushed by Boehner, their leader. Boehner said at a news conference Friday that his Republican colleagues refused to back his plan, which would have extended all tax cuts except for income over $1 million, because of fears of being blamed for a tax increase. ""They weren't taking it out on me,"" he said. ""They were dealing with the perception that somebody might accuse them of raising taxes."" The lack of backing by his own caucus was a political blow to Boehner and raised more questions than answers about what happens next in the tough negotiations with Obama on either a broad deficit reduction agreement or a smaller step to avoid the fiscal cliff. A breakdown of Boehner's miscalculation on Plan B . A senior Democratic Senate source said scenarios under consideration by the party include trying to work out short-term or comprehensive agreements now, or going into next year -- and over the fiscal cliff -- without a deal to quickly pass a compromise plan in the new Congress that convenes on January 3. Waiting until next year would make the vote a tax cut from the automatic higher rates that will take effect under the fiscal cliff, instead of the current situation of extending some cuts and having top rates go up, the source noted. In addition, Democrats will have two more seats in the new Senate and a stronger House minority, as well as increased pressure on Republicans to keep taxes low on middle class Americans, according to the source. Three possible scenarios Democrats may pursue . Trying to hammer out a deal now means working with limited time and stronger Republican contingents in both chambers, the source said. Boehner made clear Friday that the negotiations with Obama on a broad deficit reduction agreement hit an impasse this week when both sides offered their ""bottom line"" positions that included major concessions -- but remained a few hundred billion dollars apart. With his alternative plan torpedoed by his own party, Boehner said it now is time for Obama and Senate Democrats to come up with a solution. Boehner also denied a reporter's suggestion that he is walking away from further talks, but he offered no timetable or mechanism for resuming discussions. In the Senate, Reid said all House measures on the fiscal cliff so far have failed to meet the minimum demands of Obama, such as wealthy Americans paying more to prevent an increased burden on middle-class families. ""I like John Boehner, but gee whiz, this is a pretty big political battering that he has taken,"" Reid said, calling on the speaker to allow a vote on the Senate-passed Obama plan. ""It will pass. Democrats will vote for it. Some Republicans will vote for it. That is what we are supposed to do."" On Thursday night, the House passed a measure that would reduce the impact of the fiscal cliff's automatic spending cuts on the military. However, the chamber then went into recess when it was clear Boehner lacked the votes for his separate tax plan that maintained cut rates on income up to $1 million. Conservatives opposed to any kind of increase in tax rates refused to sign on, and with Democrats unified in their opposition, the measure had no chance of passing. Fallout from fiscal cliff inaction . ""There was a perception created that that vote last night was going to increase taxes. I disagree with that characterization,"" Boehner said Friday by way of explanation, adding that ""the perception was out there, and a lot of our members did not want to have to deal with it."" Reid had said the Senate would spurn the Boehner plan if it passed the House, and Obama promised to veto it if it reached his desk. According to Republican sources, the zero chance for Boehner's Plan B to actually become law influenced some wavering House members to reject it. Obama campaigned for re-election on extending the tax cuts that date back to his predecessor's administration on income up to $250,000 for families, but returning to higher rates on amounts above that threshold. Some House Republicans have said they would join Democrats in supporting the president's proposal in hopes of moving past the volatile issue to focus on the spending cuts and entitlement reforms they seek. The Plan B was significant because Republican leaders previously insisted they wouldn't raise rates on anyone. Boehner had complained Thursday that in making that concession, he expected but never got significant concessions from Obama. He elaborated on the negotiations Friday, saying he told Obama that his latest proposal made over the weekend was his bottom line. Boehner said Obama told him the White House counterproposal Monday was the president's bottom line. Boehner also repeated his complaint that Obama and Democrats were unwilling to address the spending cuts and entitlement reforms that he considers necessary to properly address the nation's chronic federal deficits and debt. ""What the president has proposed so far simply won't do anything to solve our spending problems,"" Boehner said, noting that ""because of the political divide in the country, because of the divide here in Washington, trying to bridge these differences has been difficult."" CNN Poll: Are GOP policies too extreme? In his statement Friday, Obama said he had compromised at least halfway on major issues, and that both sides have to accept they will not get all they want. The possibility of a fiscal cliff was set in motion over the past two years as a way to force action on mounting government debt. Now legislators risk looking politically cynical by seeking to weaken the measures enacted to try to force them to confront tough questions regarding deficit reduction, such as reforms to popular entitlement programs such as Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. Polling has consistently shown most Americans back the president, who insists wealthy Americans must pay more, rather than Boehner and his Republican colleagues, who have balked at tax rate hikes and demanded spending cuts and entitlement program reforms. A new CNN/ORC International survey released Thursday showed that just over half of respondents believe Republicans should give up more in any solution and consider the party's policies too extreme. Opinion: Boehner leading GOP to the apocalypse . The two sides seemingly had made progress earlier this week on forging a $2 trillion deficit reduction deal that included new revenue sought by Obama and spending cuts and entitlement changes desired by Boehner. The president's latest offer set $400,000 as the income threshold for a tax rate increase, up from his original plan of $250,000. It also included a new formula for the consumer price index applied to some entitlement benefits, much to the chagrin of liberals. Called chained CPI, the new formula includes assumptions on consumer habits in response to rising prices, such as seeking cheaper alternatives, and would result in smaller benefit increases in future years. Statistics supplied by opponents say the change would mean Social Security recipients would get $6,000 less in benefits over the first 15 years of chained CPI. Liberal groups sought to mount a pressure campaign against including the chained CPI after news emerged this week that Obama was willing to include it, calling the plan a betrayal of senior citizens who had contributed throughout their lives for their benefits.

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- A round-the-world yachtsman is on his way to dry land after spending almost three days adrift in a life raft buffeted by strong winds and rough seas off the southern coast of Australia. Alain Delord, a French sailor, was rescued by an adventure cruise ship 500 nautical miles south west of Hobart, Tasmania late on Sunday, a spokeswoman for the Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA) told CNN. Also read: Gold nugget worth $300,000 discovered in Australia . The vessel, the MV Orion, made a 60-hour detour to respond to the distress signal and its captain said the rescue took place in ""scary"" weather conditions, with poor visibility and waves that swelled up to 3.5 meters. ""We were probably only half a mile away when we saw the raft,"" Captain Mike Taylor told ABC Radio. ""I mean it was just swallowed up in the long ocean swells. You'd see it bob to the top and then disappear."" Delord, an experienced sailor, had abandoned his yacht on Friday after the mast snapped and the hull sustained damage during his round-the-world journey. According to his Facebook page, Delord embarked on his solo voyage at the end of October. Taylor said the yachtsman was doing better-than-expected after spending two nights in a life raft ""the size of a small car"". ""When I saw him, he was under the doctor's care, he looked pretty much overwhelmed. He'd probably been in fear of his life for two days."" ""He was very glad to be here and I'm pretty sure he'll be fine going forward. No major injuries."" While the Orion made its way toward Delord's life raft, aircraft dropped food, communication equipment and other supplies. His location was considered too remote for a helicopter rescue. Despite the departure from their itinerary, passengers on board the Antarctic cruise gave ""a cheer that ran the length of the ship"" when the sailor was rescued, Taylor said. Photographs posted on Orion Expedition Cruises' Facebook page showed a frail-looking Delord meeting expedition leaders. The cruise ship is due to arrive in Hobart around 8 a.m. local time on Tuesday (7 p.m. ET Monday). Jo Meehan, spokesperson for AMSA, said that the Orion's crew had displayed exemplary seamanship and had put Delord's safety ""ahead of their commercial interests."" ""They deserve the highest praise for adhering to the law of the sea,"" she said.

"(CNN) -- ""Still alive,"" Abu Omar said ruefully, responding to my question of ""How have you been?"" It's become something of a standard reply. We'd last seen each other in Damascus almost exactly a year ago, when Abu Omar and other activists devised an elaborate plan to smuggle us into the neighborhood of Kafarsouseh, right in the heart of the capital. Read more: Rebels in northern Syria pin hopes on airbase's downfall . We had snuck out of our hotel at dark, changing taxis multiple times, trying to shake off any government spies who may have been following us. We'd devised a ""signal"": if my hat was on, it meant that we were fairly confident no one was behind us. If it was off, it would let Abu Omar know that we'd been tailed. He and the other activists knew only too well the price they would pay if caught. It was a gamble for sure -- one we were acutely aware would have significantly more serious consequences for those moving us around. Read more: Envoy: 2013 could bring 100,000 deaths in Syria . But for Abu Omar and his fellow activists it was well worth it. They were desperate to show the world that they were peaceful demonstrators, to prove that the Assad regime was violently targeting them. ""We've put 20 people around the area, the neighborhood, to watch if any police are coming,"" he explained as we drove through the narrow alleyways of Kafarsouseh. Read more: 30 pro-regime forces killed in Syria blast . Demonstrators stuck to the shadows, walking in groups of two to three to avoid attracting attention. At the signal they all emerged, chanting: ""O how great is freedom."" Flags unfurled, banners quickly plastered to walls, slogans scrawled on small bright pieces of paper rained down like confetti. It lasted all of 15 minutes before word came that Syrian security forces were moving in and we all bolted. For the activists, it was a victory: most demonstrations break up within minutes (if they were even able to gather at all.) That night we spent the next few hours laying low, moving through safehouses, meeting other activists, wounded demonstrators and the doctors who had secret clinics to treat them. Read more: Syrian opposition cannot agree on a new prime minister . ""I thought we would change the regime by demonstration, by peaceful demonstrations,"" Abu Omar sighs, reflecting on what he was thinking when we'd first met. We stayed in touch through Skype, with Abu Omar sending me links to demonstrations he'd filmed or small acts of defiance and bravery, like the day activists managed to unfurl the opposition flag briefly on a main Damascus overpass. The demonstrations grew and multiplied. Abu Omar says he believed that his neighborhood would become the heart of the opposition in the capital.

Then my brother came running into the room and shook me, wake up now, they are here for you. I can't even describe the terror I felt, and I went numb."" Abu Omar says he was beaten so badly in custody he still doesn't know how he managed to survive. By the time he was released early last summer, most of the young men we'd met at the demonstration had begun to pick up arms. ""A lot of people joined the free Syrian army to protect the demonstration"" he says, but that also changed, as more joined to protect their neighbourhood and their families. The messages I would receive over Skype grew grimmer (""We had another martyr today."") Read more: 'Humanitarian emergency' as Syria runs low on medical care, food . The demonstrations and acts of defiance now seem like they hail from an age of innocence. Abu Omar says protests stopped around three months ago as the streets of Kafarsouseh crawled with Syrian security forces who regularly clash with rebel fighters. Once the scene of demonstrations, it now became yet another bloody battleground in Syria. Abu Omar himself was wounded in the arm after he too joined the rebel fighters, filming at the frontlines. One of the fighters who helped him, who he bonded with, was later killed as well. ""I just wanted to see him before he was buried,"" Abu Omar says, pausing at the painful memory. ""But I couldn't."" He's also lost family members and friends. ""Remember the man who was stabbed and beaten, who you met in the safehouse?"" he asks. ""When he recovered he went and trained with the doctors and was also training others in emergency first aid."" He was killed in the -- a 27-year-old father of two young children, just one of countless casualties. Read more: Syrian refugees continue to flood Jordan amid warnings of crisis . We also chatted about the rise in extremism, in radical Islamist units among the rebel fighting force. ""We've been oppressed long enough,"" Abu Omar explains. ""We aren't going to allow anyone to dictate to us any more. No one is going to be able to force us down a path we don't believe in"" At the same time he acknowledges that yes, extremism is yet another challenge that the country is going to have to face, as those like him, dreamers of democracy, try to carve out the future Syria.

"Bacliff, Texas (CNN) -- Sitting on their front porch in this Houston suburb, Edmond Demiraj and his family seem the picture of a contented family. But the Department of Justice now wants to upend the family: threatening to deport his wife and 19-year-old son back to their native Albania, even though he says federal prosecutors a decade ago promised him help and a Green Card in exchange for Edmond's promised testimony in a human smuggling case against a fellow Albanian immigrant. For the Demiraj family, they believe it will mean great harm, even death, for those deported. A decade ago, Edmond Demiraj (pronounced: dem-EAR-eye) was himself an illegal immigrant. He told CNN he had walked across the U.S. border from Mexico to Brownsville, Texas without any paperwork. He found work as a painter, he says, with a fellow Albanian named Bill Bedini. Not long afterwards, the Justice Department indicted Bedini, accusing him and others of running a human smuggling ring, bringing illegal aliens from Mexico into the United States. Demiraj was named in the original indictment but charges against him were later dropped. Attorneys for the Justice Department based in Houston wanted Demiraj to testify against Bedini. In exchange, Demiraj told CNN that prosecutors promised him and his family protection and promised him a Green Card, which would lead to citizenship. The offer, he says, was verbal and not on paper. ""I'm ready to work for the U.S. government, whatever they need from me,"" Demiraj told CNN. But Bedini entered a plea of not guilty, was granted bail and soon fled to Albania, according to the U.S. Marshal's office in Houston. Federal prosecutors didn't need Demiraj's testimony and handed him over to immigration officials, who quickly deported him as well. Within a few weeks back in his native Albania, Demiraj says, Bedini attacked him and tried to kill him. ""I was on my knees and he pointed the gun straight at me,"" Demiraj told CNN. ""He shot me."" Demiraj says it was only luck that saved him. Neighbors, he said, heard the gunshot and came to his assistance. Bedini fled, leaving Demiraj with a bullet wound in his side and stomach. Demiraj also says Bedini forced three nieces into prostitution in Italy but they were eventually rescued. Demiraj returned once again to the United States, again he says entering illegally at Brownsville. This time, immigration agents apprehended him and he says he spent seven months in an immigration jail before being allowed to remain in the United States on temporary status. That was six years ago. Almost ever since his return to the United States, he says, federal prosecutors have tried to deport his wife, Rodina and son, Rediol, back to Albania. His two other smaller children were born in Texas and are legal residents. ""What do you think will happen to your wife and son if they back to Albania,?"" Demiraj was asked. ""Oh, they're going to be killed. They are going to be killed,"" he replied. One federal prosecutor agreed, saying in an appellate court argument that ""there is a possibility that Mrs. Demiraj will be persecuted"" if she returns to Albania. Still, she added, ""She (Mrs. Demiraj) hasn't met her legal burden when it comes to asylum."" Even despite the dangers for Rodina Demiraj, the Justice Department is pursuing deportation. The original assistant U.S. attorney who offered Edmond Demiraj a Green Card and, according to him, protection will not comment to CNN. She is Marina Garcia Marmojelo, now nominated by President Barack Obama to be a federal judge. The only official comment to CNN from Justice is this: ""The department is not aware of any promises of physical protection ever made to Mr. Demiraj or his family. Notwithstanding this fact, we have been (in) active discussions with counsel for the Demiraj family for some time."" Demiraj's lawyers are outraged. ""This is just a shameful display of how the U.S. government will use people who they need to keep us safe and then cavalierly discard them when they are no longer of use to them,"" said Josh Rosenkranz, a New York City attorney whose firm is now representing the family. Edmond Demiraj says he will never let his wife and son return to Albania. ""I don't know what I am going to do,"" he told CNN. ""But I am not going to let them go.""

"(CNN) -- The United States will support an effort by several members of the U.N. Security Council to override the United Nations' sanctions committee and allow countries to free up frozen Libyan assets to speedily provide funds for the Libyan opposition's National Transitional Council. The Obama administration has tried for days to get approval from the U.N. sanctions committee to unfreeze $1 billion to $1.5 billion worth of Libyan assets, but South Africa has been blocking that move.  Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi funded South Africa's African National Congress -- now the ruling party -- when it was a liberation movement fighting the white apartheid regime. A Security Council meeting Wednesday concluded without a vote on a draft resolution to free $1.5 billion of assets. If South Africa doesn't lift its objections, Washington will call for a vote Thursday afternoon, U.S. officials said. South Africa -- which the officials say does not object to releasing some, but not all, of the money for urgent humanitarian needs -- does not have veto power and would not be able to block the resolution. ""We're simply proposing more time,"" South African Ambassador Baso Sangqu said Wednesday. He said it is premature for the United Nations to recognize the rebels as the legitimate government of Libya, which would be the effect of releasing the money to them. He added that there is a version of the resolution that  ""excludes any recognition by the Security Council of either party. And if that is carried, South Africa will consider that."" Earlier in the day, a senior Obama administration official, speaking on background because of the diplomatic sensitivity of the issue, said: ""If we do not have sanctions committee action today, which is the best way for this to work, ... we will support the effort by some other countries to get this done in the Security Council."" ""This has been going on for weeks and weeks,"" the official said. The administration official said that ""if there are members who are not going to support (the resolution), we're going to find another way to get the Libyans their money."" Large amounts of money held by the Libyan regime in foreign bank accounts were frozen by the council in February and March. The resolution would also lift sanctions from banks and other Libyan entities. CNN's  Richard Roth reported from the United Nations; Jill Dougherty reported from Washington; Mick Krever contributed to this report.","The United States and other countries are exploring ways to help the Libyan rebels .

"(CNN) -- U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, recovering from a gunshot wound to the head suffered January 8, is regaining part of her ability to speak and recently asked for toast while having breakfast, staffers said Wednesday. Spokesman C.J. Karamargin would not divulge what else Giffords has said, other than that she has spoken other words ""within the last few days."" ""It's very good news,"" he said. Giffords Chief of Staff Pia Carusone told CNN affiliate KMSB in Tucson, Arizona, that the congresswoman made the toast request while eating yogurt and oatmeal Monday. ""I said 'absolutely.' "" ""It's just one of many good days that she's had,"" said Carusone, adding Giffords is progressing in speech, physical and occupational therapy every day. Like at University Medical Center in Tucson, Giffords is befriending the Houston medical staff and is appreciative of the support she is getting, Carusone told KMSB. ""She's happy. She smiles when you walk in the room. She offers you a hug or a pat on the shoulder."" The chief of staff declined to comment on whether Giffords understands what happened the day of the shooting, saying that revealing that information should be up to the congresswoman and her husband, Capt. Mark Kelly. Karamargin said Giffords undergoes six hours of therapy each day, which includes ""very aggressive speech therapy."" Giffords is at TIRR Memorial Hermann rehabilitation hospital in Houston. She was moved there late last month from University Medical Center in Tucson, where she was taken after the shooting at a ""Congress on Your Corner"" event at a Tucson supermarket. Six people were killed in the incident; Giffords was among 13 injured. Authorities have said they believe Giffords was targeted in the shooting. A 22-year-old suspect, Jared Lee Loughner, is facing federal charges. Giffords' office said she actually spoke her first words before Wednesday morning, but has been speaking more since then. ""The reason for choosing this rehab facility is because of their track record,"" Karamargin said. ""They are doing a fabulous job and working with her language and speech exercise and the physical therapy part of it."" CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta called it ""a very important development"" for Giffords. He noted that Giffords was able to follow commands just after the shooting. One of her doctors told CNN Giffords was able to squeeze his hand when he asked her to just after her arrival at the hospital. Doctors have also said she has been following commands -- important, Gupta said, because it shows the ability to understand speech and then execute the command. But speaking herself ""obviously indicates her ability to communicate is there,"" he said -- meaning she can understand speech and also express herself. ""It means a lot in terms of one's overall brain recovery,"" Gupta said. Giffords was shot in the left side of her brain, where major language centers are housed. Kelly told the National Prayer Breakfast last week that he was able to be in Washington to speak because her condition ""continues to improve. Every day she gets a little bit better, and the neurosurgeons and neurologists tell me that's a great sign. The slope of that curve is very important."" Through much of her recovery, doctors said Giffords was unable to speak because of a breathing tube in her neck. Doctors at University Medical Center had said they believed she was trying to mouth words. Kelly resumed training Monday as commander of the space shuttle Endeavour's upcoming mission. He announced Friday his plan to return to his crew and resume training, saying Giffords is making progress in speech, occupational and physical therapy. Kelly spent the days after the shooting at his wife's hospital bedside, and NASA had named a backup shuttle commander for the mission in case he couldn't return in time. But Kelly last week underwent a simulated week of training in Houston, where Giffords is in the rehabilitation hospital, and NASA officials said they were confident that Kelly would be able to resume command of the mission. Kelly told reporters on Friday that he expects Giffords to witness Endeavour's launch, scheduled for April 19. With NASA planning to retire the shuttle fleet, this is expected to be Endeavour's last mission. Karamargin said that Giffords ""fully understands"" that her husband is flying the shuttle in April and is supportive of the decision. ""I have every intention for her to be at the launch,"" Kelly said.

"(CNN) -- CIA secret interrogation methods -- including detention and harsh questioning of suspected terrorists -- remain off limits to public release, a federal appeals court ruled Monday. The agency was sued eight years ago to provide details of certain communications describing the use of waterboarding and other direct intelligence-gathering methods of foreign terror suspects. A three-judge panel from the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled ""intelligence methods"" are not subject to a Freedom of Information Act request from the lawsuit by the American Civil Liberties Union. ""We give substantial weight to the government's declarations, which establish that disclosing the redacted portions of the (secret memos) would reveal the existence and scope of a highly classified, active intelligence activity,"" said the judges. The CIA has admitted as part of the lawsuit it destroyed videotaped interrogations of ""high-value"" terror suspects Abu Zubaydah and Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri. The alleged members of the al Qaeda terror network are being held overseas, including most recently at the Guantanamo Bay military prison in Cuba. The ACLU wanted transcripts of those tapes and a Zubaydah photograph, written summaries, or other information relating to the so-called ""waterboarding"" of suspected terrorists in U.S. custody. Some civil liberties groups have equated the methods to torture, and have argued that government and military officials should be held publicly accountable. ""Public disclosure of certain government records may not always be in the public interest,"" Judge Richard Wesley wrote for a unanimous three-judge panel. He said it was both ""logical and plausible"" for the CIA to control how it conducts intelligence operations, and how it works with foreign intelligence liaison partners. The judges also dismissed a lower federal court order to release two classified memos from White House attorneys, which discuss the legality of ""enhanced interrogation techniques."" The issue was whether the material was classified since the memos reportedly dealt not with specific methods, only their legality. The court said it was not its job to conduct a ""complex inquiry"" into government discussions of its intelligence-gathering. President Barack Obama has since disavowed the future use of waterboarding, where simulated drowning of immobile prisoners was conducted. The ACLU, along with the Center for Constitutional Rights, Physicians for Human Rights and Veterans for Peace -- among other groups suing -- now have the option of asking the U.S. Supreme Court to intervene. The justices earlier Monday agreed to hear a case from the ACLU over whether a coalition of Americans can go to court and challenge a federal law allowing broad electronic surveillance of suspected foreign terrorists and spies. The CIA interrogation cases are ACLU v. Department of Justice (10-4289, 10-4290, 10-4647, 10-4668).","The ACLU wanted details of CIA intelligence-gathering methods .

"(CNN) -- Sen. Hillary Clinton would have long ago distanced herself from the Rev. Jeremiah Wright if she had been a member of his church, the Democratic presidential candidate said Tuesday. It's the first time she or her campaign has commented directly on a controversy that has swirled around rival Sen. Barack Obama's campaign in recent weeks. ""I think given all we have heard and seen, he would not have been my pastor,"" Clinton said in a news conference in Greensburg, Pennsylvania. The comments came hours after the New York senator made similar comments to the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review in an editorial board interview. ""You don't choose your family, but you choose what church you want to attend,"" she told the paper. Clinton repeated those remarks in the news conference.  Watch Clinton talk about Wright and other issues Â» . An Obama campaign spokesman said Clinton's comments were part of a ""transparent effort to distract attention away from the story she made up about dodging sniper fire in Bosnia,"" a reference to comments Clinton made last week. She later said she ""misspoke."" ""The truth is, Barack Obama has already spoken out against his pastor's offensive comments and addressed the issue of race in America with a deeply personal and uncommonly honest speech,"" Obama campaign press secretary Bill Burton said. ""The American people deserve better than tired political games that do nothing to solve the larger challenges facing this country."" Clinton's comments on Wright came almost a week after Obama delivered a speech on race and politics in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, during which he denounced some of his former minister's sermons, but said he could not repudiate the man himself. The sermons in question -- some of which were several years old -- included several racially charged remarks, and became the subject of scrutiny after a news report highlighted them earlier this month. Speaking to reporters Tuesday, Clinton referenced a speech she gave nearly a year ago after talk-radio host Don Imus' controversial remarks about the Rutgers women's basketball team. ""I said it was time for standing up for what is right, for saying enough is enough, for urging that we turn a culture of degradation into a culture of empowerment, for saying that while we of course must protect our right of free expression, it should not be used as a license or an excuse to demean or humiliate our fellow citizens. Sen. Obama spoke eloquently at that time as well,"" she said. ""Everyone will have to decide these matters for themselves. They were obviously very personal matters,"" Clinton added. ""But I was asked what I would do if he was my pastor and I said I think the choice would be clear for me."" In his speech last week, Obama said he heard his former minister make controversial remarks, but not the ones that have been the subject of recent controversy. ""Did I know him to be an occasionally fierce critic of American domestic and foreign policy? Of course,"" Obama said in the speech. ""Did I ever hear him make remarks that could be considered controversial while I sat in church? Yes. Did I strongly disagree with many of his political views? Absolutely -- just as I'm sure many of you have heard remarks from your pastors, priests or rabbis with which you strongly disagreed."" Asked by CNN if her speaking openly about Wright meant the issue was now on the table in the effort to win superdelegates, Clinton answered: ""I was asked what I would do, and I answered the question.""

"(CNN) -- Zabiullah Mujahid, one of two spokesmen for Afghan Taliban leader Mullah Mohammed Omar, spoke recently with CNN's Nic Robertson about the war in Afghanistan and the Taliban's relationship with al Qaeda. CNN's Nic Robertson, left, talks to Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid at an undisclosed location. Mujahid almost never gives TV interviews and he initially said the interview with CNN would last 15 minutes, but spoke to Robertson for 45. Here is an edited transcript. CNN: Can you tell me what the Taliban strategy is in Afghanistan? Zabiullah Mujahid: The policy is quite clear. We ask from the beginning and we say once again to enforce the sharia law and Islamic government in Afghanistan, to remove foreign forces from our country. This is our country; we have to govern it. CNN: Do you want to take over the government in Kabul or do you want to work with others? Mujahid: I want to tell you clearly when we rose up in Afghanistan in 1994 we did not rise up to be the government ... you know the mujahadeen government ... and when the Russians flee Afghanistan. But the mujahadeen were fighting each other, the people were being killed. So we rose up not for power and government we rose up just ... to force Islamic law and to help our widows in Afghanistan. We did jihad for the Islamic government. And No. 2 I want to tell you clearly our Afghan nation is held hostage by foreign troops. We don't fight the government. We fight for the sake of our country, for the sake of our nation, for Islamic law and also to rescue our country from the crusader . CNN: There are going to be elections in Afghanistan this year. Does the Taliban support those elections? Mujahid: First I want to tell you this is not an election, it is selection. People are selected from the White House. This is just a joke and we ask from our Muslim brothers and our population not to take part in this election because this is people selected from the White House before the election. CNN: Will you try to stop the elections? Mujahid: We announce clearly from the beginning for our Muslim brothers not to take part in this election. We want to disturb this election; it is not the election of the Afghan nation. It is not the will of the Afghan nation. I told you clearly it is what the U.S. wants in Afghanistan, and yesterday as announced by our leader Mullah brother we will target the Afghan parliamentary members and government officials so if there are elections yes it is clear we will target them. CNN: And will you target them using suicide bombs? Mujahid: I want to tell you clearly we have different kinds of tactics. One of them yes is suicide attack. We will not target everyone with a suicide attack. We will see the place. Yes the suicide attack is part of our war with the crusader so when we need a suicide attack we will do the suicide attack. When we need a target attack we will do a target attack, when we need the bomb blast we will do the bomb blast. Where there is the combat war, we will do it in that place. According to the situation we will do the things that work. CNN: What is your policy toward Afghan civilians? Mujahid: First we give the proof from the beginning of our jihad against crusader we do not want to kill civilians. We sacrifice ourselves for the safety of the civilians; we never want to kill the civilians. Also we ask of the civilians don't be close to the troops, be away from them not to be targeted. CNN: How do you justify suicide bombs? Mujahid: This is from the history of Islam from the days of Prophet Mohammed, from the history of those days. They sacrificed some people, friends of Mohammed, for the sake of Islam. This is part of the jihad and part of the fighting. We will fight them and we will target them. CNN: Are the Taliban in Afghanistan supporting the Taliban in Pakistan with their fight? Mujahid: We do not want to interfere in the Pakistan Taliban affairs. We are Afghan Taliban and our policy is clear against the foreign troops. The second thing -- yes there are sympathies between the two sides. CNN: Do the Pakistan Taliban come to Afghanistan and help you in your fight? Mujahid: I ask you do only Americans come to Afghanistan or are there 40 other countries with them? So we are Muslims. If they come, we will say welcome to them -- our Muslim brothers in the Pakistani Taliban. CNN: President Obama is sending 20,000 more troops to Afghanistan. Will that defeat your forces, the Taliban? Mujahid: I will clearly tell you. If there are more we will kill more; if there are few we will kill fewer. CNN: The United States is sending more troops; is that going to change the war? Mujahid: If the Pentagon is thinking of changing its policy, we, too, are thinking of changing our policy. If they want to send 20,000 to start a new campaign, this is a war and we will see the war and make our policy. We also have the good players; we have the good experts of the war. CNN: Some people say President Obama has made Afghanistan a very big part of his foreign policy. Some people have suggested it may be his Vietnam. What is your opinion? Mujahid: If they want to send the troops and change things we believe they can't do anything because the 40 countries don't make any good achievements inside Afghanistan. Yes Afghanistan will be the Vietnam for them. Concerning their policy it is the same Bush policy; there are no changes in this policy. I want to tell you clearly we will win, and they will die. CNN: Can the Taliban win by military means alone or does there have to be some kind of talks? Mujahid: We believe by both, by negotiation and also by war. We ask them to leave the country; we are ready to talk. So if they are not ready to leave and they want to talk by the mouth of the gun, we will talk by the mouth of the gun. CNN: What are your terms for talking. What are the Taliban terms for talking? Mujahid: Our conditions are clear. We want to negotiate and they will not interfere in our affairs. Secondly, they will leave the country. Third, leave the Afghan people to do what they want to do, like the Islamic government they want to establish. CNN: The talks last year in Saudi Arabia -- were they helpful? Mujahid: I want to tell you clearly there is no peace talks or negotiations in Saudi Arabia. CNN: Are there any talks at all with the Afghan government? Mujahid: The Taliban under the field commander Mullah Mohammed Mujahadid do not have any representatives in peace talks. I want to tell you two things clearly. First I want to tell you some people take the former Taliban to Saudi Arabia to negotiate. They are not our representatives. Some people they sit in Kabul and talk. They are not our representative. [When] one wants to talk with us and we want to talk, it will be clear. Our representatives' names will be clear. We will announce the people. CNN: So how long is this war going to last? Mujahid: I want to tell you clearly it is war. Some people will be very weak but we will win. We will win. This is war. I cannot tell you who is going to win but I can tell you one thing. [German Chancellor] Angela Merkel when she is coming to Kunduz -- before she is coming we had intelligence reports tell us she is coming, we had the information she is coming. We did the rocket attack and she escaped, so will show them and they escaped. I will tell you we will win; we have the support of Muslim nations and this is what we believe. CNN: How do you get this intelligence? Do you have people inside American bases? Mujahid: The people who work with [Afghan President Hamid]Karzai they help us. Inside the American bases there are more people who help us, and we have intelligence from A to Z inside the foreign installations and the Afghan government. For example, on the day of the Afghan celebration [when a parade attended by President Karzai was attacked in April 2008] in the same team that work with Karzai they gave the information that he is coming. Then we attacked. CNN: So you have people inside American bases and you have people inside the ministers and you have people right next to President Karzai? Mujahid: Yes, certainly . CNN: So how come President Karzai is still alive? Mujahid: I ask you how strong the intelligence the United States has about Mullah Omar but they still don't kill him. We detect and if he is not killed this is something that belongs to God. He will be finished quickly. CNN: What is the relationship between Taliban and al Qaeda? Mujahid: Taliban is one thing and al Qaeda is another. They are global we are just in the region. CNN: Can you explain the differences between Taliban and al Qaeda. Mujahid: We are not under the command of al Qaeda. Some people are coming to fight and we say welcome. CNN: They come from al Qaeda.? Mujahid: Even any place including al Qaeda, but we don't fight under their instruction. CNN: But they help you, al Qaeda helps you? Mujahid: We are from this country; we are the boss. We do not have any link with them -- they do not have any link with us under the command of al Qaeda. If mujahadeen freely want to do jihad they can come.

"(CNN) -- President Barack Obama has nominated former Republican Sen. Chuck Hagel as his next defense secretary and anti-terrorism chief John Brennan as CIA director. Hagel's nomination could be the most contentious of those Obama is making because of positions the former lawmaker took on Israel and Iran and his opposition to the troop surges in Iraq and Afghanistan. CNN's John Berman on Tuesday spoke to Newsweek and Daily Beast special correspondent Peter Beinart about ""Why Hagel Matters,"" the piece he wrote on Hagel's nomination: . CNN: Peter wrote what I think is (one of the) most ... interesting and compelling articles about the Hagel nomination, explaining it perhaps better than anyone I've seen, including the president. The first paragraph of the piece, you write, it may prove the most consequential foreign policy appointment of his presidency because the struggle over Hagel is a struggle over whether Obama can change the terms of the foreign policy debate. Explain that for me. Peter Beinart: I think so far, the debate about military action in Iran has been conducted by and large in Washington, as if Iraq and Afghanistan didn't happen. As if we haven't learned anything from the disaster (of) these two wars over the last 10 years. I think the real struggle between Hagel and his foes is he wants to bring some of the lessons in to the Iran debate that we learned about (Iraq) and Afghanistan. He talks very compellingly about the fact wars once launched can't be fully controlled. He is very cognizant of the enormous financial cost that these wars have imposed on the United States, and I think the heart of the hostility is the fear that his recognition about what happened in Afghanistan and Iraq will make taking us to war in Iran harder. Hagel vows to fight 'distortions' CNN: You suggest there are no consequences for the Iraq War in terms of those who supported or imposed it. Beinart: What I said if you listen to Republican foreign policy discourse, with the exception of a few people like Chuck Hagel, you would think the Iraq War had been a great success. Because all of the same people who said it was a great success are defining in large measure the debate over war on Iran, pushing the United States closer, and I think Hagel is a (messenger for) ... the president to say, ""Hold on a second here. ""I am going to set the bar for war higher than George W. Bush, and I don't think this is a simple and easy thing."" CNN: Why does Obama need that? Obama opposed the war in Iraq for longer than Chuck Hagel. Hagel voted for the invasion. Beinart: Yes, that's right. Chuck Hagel did. But ... (he was) one of the few Republican senators who, after the war started, he began to rethink his view of the world. It's not only about Iran. I think the other big thing about the Hagel nomination is that Obama wants someone to bring the Defense Department back into balance with America's financial resources. CNN: Is this a smaller foreign policy? A smaller defense policy? Beinart: I think it is. The dominant Republican way to talk about the defense budget is to completely separate it, wall it off from all considerations about the national debt. Chuck Hagel doesn't see it that way. He's a lot like Dwight Eisenhower, who people forget drove the defense budget down quite dramatically because he believed America's real power was its fiscal health, its economic health. White House officials reach out to Jewish community to answer Hagel concerns . CNN: A lot of fire around Hagel's nomination has to do with Israel and Hagel's support and the lack of support as the case may be for Israel. (Here's) ... what Sen. John Cornyn of Texas said about Hagel, ""Comments he's made about the so-called Jewish lobby, which seems to denigrate the efforts of pro-Israel individuals, myself included, who view that relationship as a special relationship, one that's important to our national security and stability in the region."" Hagel suggests he misspoke or shouldn't have used those words. But is this a real problem for him? Beinart: No, I think this is really a smoke screen. If Chuck Hagel had the same views on Iran and defense spending as John McCain, no one would even be talking about these comments. I think it's really a sideshow. One of the most important Jewish leaders, Malcolm Hoenlein, used the same phrase -- ""Jewish lobby"" -- just last December. Yes, it would be more accurate to call it, I think, the kind of right-wing, pro-Israel lobby. But the truth is many of the people in the pro-Israel lobby are, in fact, Jewish, as is myself. One of the groups is the American Jewish Committee. So to suggest this is in any way anti-Semitic, when many, many Jews, including a rabbi from Omaha, has testified to (Hagel's) good relationship with (the) Jewish community I think is character assassination, to be honest.

"Washington (CNN) -- Supporters of the Violence Against Women Act hope to revive the law in a new Congress after efforts to renew it failed in the last one. ""It is an early priority for us,"" House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-California, told CNN as the 113th Congress convened Thursday. ""Since it passed the Senate last time, with two more Democrats in the Senate, we hope that it will have an easy path there and a doable path there -- and a successful one in the House."" The Violence Against Women Act mostly provides support for organizations that serve domestic violence victims. Criminal prosecutions of abusers are generally the responsibility of local authorities, but the act stiffened sentences for stalking under federal law. Supporters credit the 1994 act with sharply reducing the number of lives lost to domestic violence over the past two decades. Baseball player charged after domestic dispute . The Senate voted to renew the act for a third time in April, barring agencies that receive funding under the law from discriminating against gays and lesbians, allowing immigrants who face domestic violence to seek legal status and giving tribal authorities new power to prosecute cases on Indian reservations. The Republican-led House passed its own bill, one that didn't include those provisions and that advocates said rolled back some protections in existing law. The White House threatened to veto it, and no resolution was reached before the clock ran out on lawmakers this week. The failure to reauthorize the act leaves people such as Nancy Neylon, executive director of the Ohio Domestic Violence Network, facing the prospect of layoffs at her organization and others that work with spousal abuse victims. Neylon said the act funds the paycheck of one of her group's nine employees and others in towns around the state. ""We have no state money that supports domestic violence or sexual violence programs,"" Neylon said. The money already in the pipeline is running out, she said -- and without federal support, ""We have no services here."" Granderson: Stop and think, Rihanna . The National Task Force to End Sexual and Domestic Violence Against Women says the failure to reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act doesn't mean the law is dead -- ""VAWA itself is very much alive and will continue in its 2005 version,"" it notes. But the programs it supports ""are certainly threatened because the budget crises at the local, state and national levels are always looming."" The standoff over the so-called fiscal cliff put off across-the-board cuts to those programs, according to the task force, a coalition of civil rights groups other advocates. But without further action, it says nearly 200,000 people could lose help they now receive. Opinion: Don't gut the VAWA . Neylon's Columbus-based organization supports shelters and programs across Ohio. Federal money supports legal aid for victims facing custody, housing, employment or immigration problems and training for police, prosecutors and probation officers involved in domestic violence cases, she said. Other programs under the Violence Against Women Act pay for court programs aimed at curbing abuse. The existence of federal law ""drew incredible attention to the issue"" and spurred states to toughen their own laws on spousal abuse and sexual assault, Neylon said. It means protective orders cross state lines -- an important issue in a state where metropolitan areas such as Cincinnati and Toledo straddle the borders. Neylon said changes included in Senate bill ""bubbled up from the field"" based on years of experience by women's advocates, prosecutors, judges and social workers -- ""literally thousands of people providing input into what the major problems were out here in the country."" ""We've now had a number of years to look at what the needs are, and the field was telling our federal legislators, 'This is what we need,' "" she said. Opinion: House GOP failed women on Violence Against Women Act . The Senate bill passed 68-31, with the support of 14 Republicans. The 222-205 vote on the House bill was more of a party-line affair, with only six Democrats supporting it and 23 Republicans voting against it. The House bill failed to extend the power of Native American tribes to prosecute offenses committed by non-Indians on tribal lands, which the National Congress of American Indians said allows abusers to ""game the system"" and avoid prosecution. Talks extended into late December, with Vice President Joe Biden -- the architect of the 1994 law -- and House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-Virginia, attempting unsuccessfully to reach a deal. Cantor spokeswoman Megan Whittemore told CNN the majority leader ""has been working with our members, Vice President Biden and groups who serve those directly affected by these crimes to seek common ground across party lines and put an end to violence against women."" She pointed to a letter from the task force praising Cantor's ""good-faith efforts"" to find a resolution. But the letter also said the task force remains committed to keeping the language involving tribal courts. And Pelosi said the House bill ""was really a step backward for women.""

"London (CNN) -- Police are to investigate claims that the British secret services were involved in the rendition of two men to Libya and their alleged ill treatment there, London's Metropolitan Police said Thursday. The investigation will take place now rather than at the end of a government inquiry into allegations of UK involvement in abuse of detainees, the police said in a joint statement with prosecutors. One of the cases involves Abdul Hakim Belhaj, a former leader of the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group who became a senior revolutionary commander, while the second is Libyan citizen Saami Al-Saadi, officials confirmed. ""The allegations raised in the two specific cases concerning the alleged rendition of named individuals to Libya and the alleged ill-treatment of them in Libya are so serious that it is in the public interest for them to be investigated now rather than at the conclusion of the Detainee Inquiry,"" the Metropolitan Police said in a joint statement with the director of public prosecutions. John Sawers, chief of the British foreign intelligence agency MI6, welcomed the decision in a statement Thursday. ""We will of course be cooperating fully with the police on this new investigation, as we have done on the one now concluding,"" Sawers said. ""It is in the service's interest to deal with the allegations being made as swiftly as possible so we can draw a line under them and focus on the crucial work we face now and in the future."" A statement from the Cabinet Office said the government would also cooperate fully. ""The government stands firmly against torture and cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment or punishment,"" it said. ""We do not condone it, nor do we ask others to do it on our behalf. The security and intelligence agencies work tirelessly to protect us day in, day out."" The Detainee Inquiry, to be headed by Peter Gibson, was ordered by Prime Minister David Cameron in 2010 but cannot start until all related criminal investigations have been concluded, meaning it may be further delayed by Thursday's decision. The inquiry's remit is ""to look systematically at the allegations about whether British personnel were in any way involved in the alleged mistreatment of detainees held by other countries,"" following the September 11, 2001, attacks on the United States, its website says. Last September it confirmed it would look into the claims of British involvement in renditions to Libya. Clive Stafford Smith, director of the legal action charity Reprieve, also welcomed Thursday's decision by police and prosecutors. Their statement made clear that ""British complicity in the torture of Libyans Sami al Saadi and Abdulhakim Belhaj by the Gaddafi regime is so blatant that a criminal inquiry must go ahead before the government's deeply flawed Gibson Inquiry can get started,"" he said. Al-Saadi, also known as Abu Munthir, is suing the British government and intelligence agencies for their alleged complicity in his rendition from Hong Kong to Tripoli in 2004 and subsequent inhuman detention, torture and abuse by the Libyan authorities, according to a letter from his lawyers placed online by Reprieve. Documents found at Libyan intelligence headquarters in Tripoli by campaign group Human Rights Watch last September highlighted the cooperation between Libya and Western intelligence agencies after Libya ended its weapons of mass destruction program in 2004. CNN saw an exchange of information between Libyan intelligence and Western intelligence agencies -- such as the CIA, the MI6 in Britain and Canada's intelligence service -- in documents dating from 2004 and 2005. They included a March 6, 2004, CIA letter to Libyan officials concerning Belhaj. British police and prosecutors also said they would not charge any individuals in relation to allegations of wrongdoing by British officials in two separate investigations, in their statement Thursday. One, known as Operation Hinton, relates to claims that British intelligence officials were involved in the ill-treatment and torture of Binyam Mohamed, an Ethiopian-born British resident and former Guantanamo Bay inmate, while he was detained in Pakistan. The other, Operation Iden, was set up to investigate possible criminal wrongdoing after an individual who was detained by U.S. authorities in Afghanistan was questioned by a member of the Secret intelligence Service, or MI6. Neither investigation produced evidence that would have led to a criminal conviction of an individual, the police and prosecutors concluded. But, they added, ""Nothing in this decision should be read as concluding that the ill-treatment alleged by Mr Mohamed did not take place or that it was lawful."" Stafford Smith welcomed that statement as ""the first time any official in any country has conceded that Binyam Mohamed was tortured -- and it is clear from this statement that the CPS accepts that Mr Mohamed was tortured and it was a criminal offense."" It was unsurprising that the authorities had not found evidence to prosecute an individual in the case, he said. ""But the main focus of all this should not be the rank and file, but those who were signing off the torture policy at the top,"" he added, naming former Prime Minister Tony Blair among them. The police and CPS have also agreed to set up a panel to look into other claims of ill treatment of detainees and determine whether they should be investigated before the Detainee Inquiry concludes, Thursday's statement said. CNN's Raja Razek contributed to this report.","NEW: The UK government stands firmly against torture and will cooperate fully, it says .

"(CNN) -- Didier Drogba was dropped to the bench for the first time in his long international career on Saturday, but his Ivory Coast teammates took up the responsibility to win a place in the quarterfinals of the Africa Cup of Nations with a 3-0 win over Tunisia. Togo's later 2-0 win over Algeria ensured the Ivorians went through, and meant the 1990 champions became the first nation to be eliminated. Drogba handed over the captain's armband to Didier Zakora, having failed to impress in his team's opening Group D victory over Togo. The 34-year-old former Chelsea star had complained of a lack of match fitness before the tournament started in South Africa, having not played since the end of the Chinese league season with his club Shanghai Shenhua in early November. Part of the Ivorians' ""golden generation,"" Drogba is still waiting for his first AFCON title in six attempts, having lost in the 2012 final after a penalty shootout against Zambia. However, he did come on as a replacement in the second half for his 92nd international appearance as Yaya Toure and another substitute, Didier Ya Konan, scored late goals to add to Gervinho's first-half opener. ""Why didn't I play Didier Drogba? Because it seemed to me that the 11 players I picked were the best to overcome this good Tunisian side,"" Ivory Coast coach Sabri Lamouchi told reporters in Rustenburg. ""My first satisfaction comes from the victory and the second from the content. We really entered this competition today. ""We caused a lot of problems for this very good Tunisian team and were never really threatened at any point."" Arsenal striker Gervinho put his team ahead in the 21st minute with his second goal of the tournament, but the Elephants needed to wait until two minutes from the end before two-time African player of the year Toure curled in his second in two games. Ya Konan, also dropped to the bench after starting against Togo, sidefooted home the third goal in the 90th minute. Togo helped the Ivorians to go through to the knockout phase ahead of the final round of group games by beating Tunisia's north African rivals Algeria. Captain Emmanuel Adebayor scored the opening goal in the 32nd minute to give his team hope of reaching the last eight for the first time, needing only a draw in Wednesday's match against Tunisia. The match was held up late in the second half when a goal post was knocked over after Algeria's Adlene Guedioura collided with the netting, meaning 13 minutes of added time were played. Two minutes into that, Dove Wome struck on the counterattack to end Algeria's hopes of going through. Adebayor has returned to international action after settling a dispute with national team officials. Togo did not reach the finals of the 2012 tournament, having been reinstated in the qualifiers after initially being banned. The squad broke rules by withdrawing before the 2010 event in Angola following a gun attack on the team's bus that left three people dead.","Ivory Coast captain and talisman Didier Drogba dropped for 3-0 win over Tunisia .

"Cairo (CNN) -- A 30-year ironclad rule undone by an 18-day revolution saw its epilogue Saturday -- with former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak ordered to spend the rest of his days behind bars. At one time, Mubarak, 84, dominated Egypt's political landscape by intimidating opponents and infiltrating political movements. Saturday, after a 10-month trial he attended on a stretcher locked inside a courtroom cage, a judge ordered his transfer to a Cairo maximum security prison, according to state TV. Angry protests erupted inside and outside the court as the former president's allies and foes voiced their reaction to the landmark verdicts. Some slammed the judge for finding him guilty, while others called for his execution. While Mubarak was sentenced to life in prison for his role in the killing of pro-reform demonstrators -- a charge for which he could have faced the death penalty -- he was cleared of corruption, and his sons acquitted of the charges they faced. Judge Ahmed Refaat was in no doubt about the significance of the moment, as he spoke of the ""dark"" days of Mubarak's three-decade rule. ""We made a promise to have a fair trial based on the law of the land and we wanted this historical trial to be just and fair in order to give the rights to its true owners, no matter what the sentence will be,"" he said. When the pro-democracy protests started in January last year, few would have dreamed this would be the punishment handed down to the man who ruled over them for so long. Timeline of Mubarak's ascent and fall from power . Mubarak came to power in 1981, after then-President Anwar Sadat died in a hail of gunfire at a military parade -- killed by Islamic militants from within the army's own ranks after he took the dramatic step of making peace with Israel. He was a Soviet-trained pilot who was chief of staff of Egypt's air force during the 1973 Mideast war. The early success of Egyptian pilots against Israel made him a national hero, and Sadat made him vice president in 1975. Upon assuming office following Sadat's assassination, one of Mubarak's first acts was to declare a state of emergency that barred unauthorized assembly, restricted freedom of speech and allowed police to jail people indefinitely. It finally expired this week. Mubarak made extensive use of those emergency powers in his time at the helm. The Egyptian army put down riots by disgruntled police officers in 1986, and Mubarak threw an estimated 30,000 people in jail when jihadists carried out a string of attacks on tourists. He won four terms as president in elections that were widely considered formalities. His fifth election, in 2005, was Egypt's first multi-party presidential vote, but many considered that, too, to be a sham. The country's economy stagnated for the first 20 years of his rule. Development picked up in the past decade, fueled by a move away from state control and by billions in tourist dollars, but analysts say its gains have been unevenly distributed. About 40 percent of Egyptians currently live in poverty. Under Mubarak, Egypt was a major player in Israeli-Palestinian peace talks, and it contributed troops to the U.S.-led coalition that drove Iraq out of Kuwait in 1991. Arab leaders: Where are they now? It receives about $1.3 billion in military aid from Washington every year, second only to Israel, and has received nearly $30 billion in economic aid since 1975, according to State Department figures. Shortly before his fall from grace, President Barack Obama said Mubarak had been ""very helpful on a range of tough issues."" And Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu last summer told the Arab-language news network Al-Arabiya that he respected Mubarak. ""He held peace between Israel and Egypt for over 30 years, and that's a great achievement, and I think it should not be forgotten,"" Netanyahu said. In 2005, when Egyptians mounted large-scale protests to demand fundamental and widespread reform, Mubarak intimidated the leaders of the officially banned but tolerated Muslim Brotherhood, harassed middle-class demonstrators and managed to pick off protest leaders. But Mubarak was finally forced to step down February 11 after a nearly three-week uprising during which protesters demanded reform and a new government. The human rights group Amnesty International estimated at least 840 people were killed by security forces during the revolution and more than 6,000 were injured. Egypt is now ruled by a military council that has promised to hand over power after elections. A polarizing runoff vote for the presidency is due in mid-June, pitting a member of the Muslim Brotherhood against a former Mubarak minister. Neither had been favored by the revolutionaries responsible for toppling Mubarak -- and some fear a win for former Prime Minister Ahmed Shafik will mean the ousted strongman's regime lives on in a different guise. During his long years at the helm, Mubarak escaped at least two assassination attempts, including a close call in 1995 when Islamic militants opened fire on his motorcade at a pan-African conference in Ethiopia. In 2003, the aging autocrat collapsed while delivering a televised speech to the Egyptian parliament -- returning later to blame his illness on the flu. He went to Germany in 2004 for back surgery and returned in 2010 to have his gall bladder removed. Despite his bouts of illness, Mubarak never picked a vice president. He was widely considered to have anointed his son Gamal as his successor. Now Gamal and his brother, Alaa, have seen their ailing father -- who never expressed remorse while in court on his hospital gurney -- condemned to spend his last years behind prison walls. Although he may yet appeal the verdict, Mubarak is still the first of the leaders deposed in the Arab Spring to be handed a court sentence in person. ""This verdict instructs us all that leaders are not immune from prosecution and in the very heart of the Arab world, in a civilian court, a leader has actually been brought to justice,"" said David Scheffer, a former U.S. ambassador-at-large for war crimes. ""That's extremely important.""

"Sao Paulo, Brazil (CNN) -- After years of trying to put the past behind it, Brazil has created a truth commission to investigate crimes committed during a painful period in history known as the dirty war. Hundreds of people disappeared or were killed during a 20-year military dictatorship that ended in 1985. Violent student protests and an armed underground movement were squashed in brutal crackdowns. Some 9,000 people were jailed and tortured. Among them was a young leftist guerrilla, Dilma Rousseff, who went on to become the current president of Brazil. Rousseff inaugurated the commission in May. ""Brazil deserves the truth. The new generations deserve the truth,"" she said at a ceremony in Brasilia. ""Above all, those who lost friends and relatives and who continue suffering as if they were dying again every day deserve the truth,"" she said as she choked back tears. A blanket amnesty law drawn up during the dictatorship means the commission won't launch any trials. But some Brazilians hope it could be a first step toward having that law abolished, something that has already happened in neighboring Argentina and Uruguay. Torture victims have long fought for a change to the law. Amelia Teles was jailed in 1972 along with her husband at a Sao Paulo police station once known as OBAN, a notorious torture center. ""That's where my cell was, it was 'X6,' "" Teles said as she walked around the now-reformed police station. ""From what I remember, I was tortured for 15 days."" Teles and her husband were militants of the underground Communist Party. She said police brought in their children, ages 4 and 5, to pressure them. ""When (the children) saw me, they said, 'Mom, why is Dad green and you're blue?' "" Teles said. ""I looked down at my body and realized I was so bruised that I was blue all over."" Teles pointed to the second-story rooms where she said she suffered waterboarding and electric shocks and spent hours in a device called the ""parrot's perch."" ""I spent days without any hope of surviving,"" she said. ""But the fact that I can come here and speak and not be jailed ... I think that's progress. That's a political victory."" The seven-member truth commission has been given two years to investigate human rights crimes. It has unprecedented access to former prisoners, military leaders and archives. Paulo Sergio Pinheiro, one of the commissioners and a former diplomat at the United Nations, said the group hopes to expose information that has been hidden for the last 27 years. ""We are trying to reconstruct the chain of command of the decisions to kill or torture,"" Pinheiro said. ""Something that's not clear or transparent at this moment."" The government has had to overcome outright hostility from retired military brass, and the commission is now grappling with the possibility that some of the archives may have been destroyed. But Pinheiro is optimistic the commission will help Brazil come to terms with its past and a legacy of impunity in some institutions. ""There are some practices by state agents, like torture or summary executions, that need to be stopped,"" he said. ""The report, the work of the truth commission, will be a collaboration to deal with this terrible legacy."" Many Brazilians agree that exposing the truth is a way of exacting justice. Ivo Herzog was 9 years old when his father, the editor-in-chief of a TV station, was killed while in jail. Military officials called it a suicide. But Herzog said he believes his father, Vladimir Herzog, was tortured and killed, a theory that archives have supported. Herzog said he doesn't want revenge, but he does want the perpetrators to be known. ""To be held accountable by society,"" he said, ""that's the most important thing."" More and more Brazilians are calling for the same. A group of young activists has started organizing protests outside the homes of former military rulers to denounce them to their neighbors and society at large. ""These people who are living the good life like nothing happened, I want to see them excluded,"" Herzog said. ""That's my biggest wish.""

"Tucson, Arizona (CNN) -- Shot in the head less than a week ago, U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords continues to make positive progress, her husband and doctors told CNN in exclusive interviews on Thursday. The chief of neurosurgery at Tucson's University Medical Center said that Giffords' eye movements suggest the congresswoman is experiencing ""glimmers of recognition."" ""That tracking of the eyes tells you a whole lot more, that she's aware of her surroundings to some extent,"" Dr. Michael Lemole told Dr. Sanjay Gupta, CNN's chief medical correspondent. ""She's trying to engage that reality."" Giffords opened her eyes briefly for the first time Wednesday, with her husband, her parents and other members of Congress in the room, and continued to open them on Thursday. ""It was extraordinary,"" said Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-New York, who was holding Giffords' hand when she opened her eyes on Wednesday. ""It was a miracle to witness."" The incident occurred shortly after President Barack Obama had visited Giffords in her hospital room. ""I think she realized the president of the United States was there, but I'm not sure she knew why,"" Mark Kelly, Giffords' husband, told CNN Thursday in an exclusive interview. Giffords' breathing tube could be removed as early as Friday, Kelly said. Less than an hour after his Wednesday visit, given permission to disclose the information by Kelly, Obama electrified a memorial-service crowd and a national television audience by revealing one of the most promising pieces of news about Gifford's condition to emerge since an assassination attempt against her on Saturday. Giffords was squeezing and stroking Gillibrand's hand, as doctors previously said she had been able to do. Giffords ""absolutely could hear everything we were saying,"" Gillibrand said. ""And Debbie (Wasserman Schultz, D-Florida) and I were telling her how much she was inspiring the nation with her courage, her strength, and we were talking about the things we wanted to do as soon as she was better."" Gillibrand mentioned having another night out with Giffords and her husband for beer and pizza. And Wasserman Schultz recounted telling her, ""Come on, you've got to get better, because we expect you up in New Hampshire this summer"" at Wasserman Schultz's vacation home. ""And just as I said that, that's when she suddenly was struggling to open ... her eyes,"" Wasserman Schultz said. ""First just a little bit. And the doctors couldn't believe it. They said, 'This is such a good time.' "" Kelly saw her struggling, Gillibrand said, and he and the others began to encourage her, saying, ""Open your eyes, Gabby. Open your eyes."" And Giffords did. Her right eye remains bandaged, but Giffords is opening both of them, doctors said Thursday . ""She took a moment to focus, you could see she was focusing,"" Gillibrand said. ""And then Mark said ... 'Gabby, if you can see me, if you can see me, give us a thumbs-up ...  She didn't only give a thumbs-up, she literally raised her entire hand."" But Giffords didn't stop there, Gillibrand said. She reached out and grabbed her husband ""and is touching him and starts to really choke him like she was really trying to hug him."" He asked her to touch his wedding ring, ""and she touches his ring, then she grabs his whole watch and wrist and then the doctor was just so excited, he said, 'You don't understand ... this is amazing what she is doing right now and beyond our greatest hopes.' "" ""It was, as you can imagine, a glorious moment,"" said House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, who was also in the room. Of the six patients the hospital is still treating from Saturday's shooting, Giffords is the only one in critical condition. Four others are in fair condition, and the sixth was being released from the hospital Thursday, said Dr. Peter Rhee, medical director of the University Medical Center's trauma center. Giffords remains in critical condition because doctors are worried about her losing ground, said Lemole. Giffords' doctors spoke exclusively to CNN Thursday about the first moments after her arrival at the hospital. ""My first response was I grabbed her hand, leaned into her an said 'Ms. Giffords, you're in the hospital, we're going to care for you, please squeeze my hand' and she did,"" said Dr. Randall Friese, a trauma surgeon. ""I got the impression that she was trying to communicate but was frustrated by the fact that she couldn't communicate,"" he said. In some of his first public comments since Saturday's shooting, Giffords' husband told CNN he was in Houston when he got a call saying that his wife had been shot. Worried that a commercial flight would take too long, Kelly, a NASA astronaut, flew in a friend's plane to Arizona and met Giffords in the intensive care unit after surgery. A 9-year-old girl, Christina Green, and Arizona's chief federal judge, John Roll, are among the dead, along with Gabe Zimmerman, a Giffords staffer. A funeral mass was held for Green on Thursday. Also Thursday, first lady Michelle Obama released an open letter to parents about the shooting. ""In the days and weeks ahead, as we struggle with these issues ourselves, many of us will find that our children are struggling with them as well,"" she wrote. ""The questions my daughters have asked are the same ones that many of your children will have -- and they don't lend themselves to easy answers."" ""But they will provide an opportunity for us as parents to teach some valuable lessons -- about the character of our country, about the values we hold dear, and about finding hope at a time when it seems far away,"" the first lady continued. Authorities say Giffords was the target of the shooting. Twelve other people suffered gunshot wounds, the Pima County Sheriff has said, while others were injured trying to flee the scene. Tucson resident Jared Lee Loughner, 22, is facing federal charges in the attack. A bag that is believed to belong to Loughner contains the same kind of ammunition as was used in Saturday's massacre, authorities said Thursday. Even when Giffords' prognosis was grim, she has consistently defied the odds and met or exceeded expectations. The next step, doctors told reporters Thursday, is the removal of Giffords' breathing tube. She is breathing on her own ""with very little support,"" Rhee said, but he wasn't sure when the tube might come out. Giffords is ""becoming more and more alert at this time,"" he said, telling reporters she acts like someone waking up in the morning -- yawning and rubbing her eyes. She has been opening her eyes more often since Wednesday, Lemole said. ""This is all very encouraging,"" he said. ""... It is a significant move forward."" Rhee said Giffords has been undergoing physical therapy, in which staffers sit her up with her legs dangling off the side of the bed. When asked, she can move both legs, straightening them out, he said. Safeway, which owns the grocery store where the shooting took place, took out a full-page ad in Tucson's Arizona Daily Star newspaper Thursday, saying it is proud to be part of a community that cares so deeply about one another. The company is working to reopen the store, it said. Doctors have cautiously described Giffords' recovery as going according to plan, so far absent of any complications or issues, and have said throughout that she has been able to communicate when they lessen her sedation and allow her to awaken. Lemole said he was in the room when Giffords opened her eyes, saying it might have been the ""unexpected familiarity"" of having close friends visit that perhaps Giffords wasn't expecting. ""This is the part that doctors, I think, have the hardest time with -- those intangibles in medicine,"" he said, referring to the role that family and friends can play in prompting patient progress. ""Miracles happen every day,"" Lemole said. ""... A lot of medicine is outside our control.""

"(CNN) -- The new Steven Spielberg blockbuster ""Lincoln"" focuses on the final months of the U.S. president's life as he tries to find a way to end the Civil War and unite the country. Now, the document Lincoln signed that officially started the war is up for sale, valued at nearly a million dollars. The one-page document, signed April 19, 1861, authorized the blockade of Southern ports, which, under international law, was an act of war. ""The action was bold and with great risk,"" said Nathan Raab, vice president of The Raab Collection, which is offering the document for sale at $900,000. ""Lincoln was aware that the blockading of ports was an act of war. Some in his cabinet argued that a blockade would constitute recognition of the sovereignty of the Confederacy, something the North wanted to avoid. Lincoln was less interested in the legal definitions of 'war' than in victory, and he approved it despite the objections."" Go where Lincoln went . The Supreme Court later ruled the document as the official start of the Civil War, Raab said. It was April 12, 1861, when Confederate forces opened fire on Fort Sumter in Charleston harbor, South Carolina, initiating the hostilities between North and South. Three days later, Lincoln issued a proclamation that an insurrection existed, and he called out 75,000 men to put it down. Four days after that, on April 19, he ordered the Southern port blockade. ""I hereby authorize and direct the Secretary of State to affix the Seal of the United States to a Proclamation setting on foot a Blockade of the ports of the States of South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, Florida, Mississippi, Louisiana, and Texas,"" the document states.

"(CNN) -- A tax credit to help individuals and families buy health insurance is at the heart of a health care proposal Sen. John McCain unveiled Tuesday. The credits will spark greater competition among insurance providers and put ""individuals and families back in charge,"" the presumptive Republican presidential nominee said during a speech in Tampa, Florida. ""Millions of Americans would be making their own health care choices again,"" McCain said. ""Insurance companies could no longer take your business for granted, offering narrow plans with escalating costs."" Under McCain's heath care plan, individuals would be eligible for a $2,500 credit and families a $5,000 credit to help pay for health insurance if they do not subscribe to, or do not have access to, employer-provided health care coverage. The government would send the money directly to insurers. McCain's plan would cost $3.6 trillion over 10 years, the campaign said. McCain would pay for the program by eliminating the tax break employers get for offering insurance. Doug Holtz-Eakin, a McCain senior policy adviser, said the tax credit would allow individuals to obtain health coverage ""tailored to the circumstances of your life"" rather than being forced to accept the insurance provided by an employer.  Watch McCain reject universal coverage Â» . McCain also proposed that state governments set up a nonprofit Guaranteed Access Plan to provide coverage to individuals who are denied coverage from private insurers because of pre-existing conditions. McCain said he would work with Congress, governors and private industry to adequately fund the program.  Watch McCain say he wants a system accessible to everyone Â» . Holtz-Eakin said McCain's willingness to work with the states to create individual programs in each state shows he understands a ""better job doesn't take the form of a one-size-fits-all plan formed in Washington."" McCain argues that the increased competition will lower health care costs, which will allow more of the roughly 47 million Americans who are uninsured into the system. The Arizona Republican would also permit generic drugs to be imported from Canada to increase competition among pharmaceutical manufacturers. ""We know competition and choice drive down costs,"" said Carly Fiorina, a former Hewlett-Packard CEO who is advising the McCain campaign. Holtz-Eakin said the plan would also encourage insurers and health care providers to deliver better health and disease management as well as more preventive medicine such as anti-smoking programs, which he said would further reduce costs. Health providers would be paid for ""doing the right thing"" rather than being paid for every test and procedure, he said. In coordination with McCain's speech, his campaign released a television ad that touts the plan. In the ad, which is airing in Iowa, McCain says, ""I can characterize my approach on health care by choice and competition, affordability and availability. ... The fundamental problem is not the quality of health care; it's the cost of health care. So, health care must be made affordable and available.""  Watch McCain call for putting families in control Â» . Critics of McCain's plan said the tax credits would not put a significant dent into what a family must pay to buy health insurance on their own. The average cost of providing health care for a family of four annually is more than $12,000, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. For individuals with pre-existing conditions, the costs of obtaining insurance could even be higher, critics said. Critics also said encouraging individuals to buy health insurance could undermine the system of employee-based health insurance, with no guarantee a new system would emerge to replace it. Clinton picked up that argument while criticizing McCain, saying in a statement, ""John McCain is proposing a radical plan that would mean millions of Americans would lose their job-based coverage."" ""So while people might have a 'choice' of getting such coverage, employers would have no incentive to provide it,"" she said. Fiorina, however, said McCain's plan would not undermine the employee-based health insurance system because employers would continue to offer health coverage to attract and keep quality employees. McCain's free market approach to health care reform is very different from the proposals offered by the Democratic presidential candidates, Sens. Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. Both of their proposals include more government mandates for health care coverage. Clinton would mandate that every individual have health care and would provide government subsidies to those who could not afford to purchase insurance on on their own. She would also allow individuals to join the private health care plans that are offered to members of Congress, and she would create a new public insurance program modeled after Medicare. Clinton also includes tax credits to individuals to help buy health insurance and would require large businesses to provide or help pay for health insurance for their employees.  Watch McCain says he opposes mandates Â» . Clinton's plan is estimated to cost $110 billion annually, which would be paid for by eliminating the Bush tax cuts for those making more than $250,000 and by eliminating waste and inefficiencies within the system. Unlike Clinton, Obama would not mandate that every individual have health care insurance, but he would require health insurance for children. As part of his plan, Obama would create a public insurance program for those not covered by private insurance and would also require large employers to help pay for their employees' health coverage. Obama's plan is estimated to cost between $50 billion and $65 billion and, like Clinton's plan, would be paid for by eliminating the Bush tax cuts for those earning more than $250,000 a year.

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Russian supermodel Natalia Vodianova's life has been a classic rags-to-riches fairytale, taking her from poverty in provincial Russia to a cosmopolitan life of wealth and aristocracy. Supermodel Natalia Vodianova was discovered in Moscow in a classic rags-to-riches tale. Her intelligence, poise and charm (as well as stunning features and long limbs), have propelled her from anonymity to being one of the most recognizable and respected models in the fashion industry. Her success has earned her the nickname Supernova. Not content to grace the covers of glossy magazines and the catwalks of the world's glamorous fashion capitals, Vodianova has also carved a role as a philanthropist. In 2005 she founded the Naked Heart Foundation, a charity that builds playgrounds for children across Russia. ""Giving back just feels so great and I always try to open each play park with myself being present for the children because it makes it more special for them. I go to very remote parts of Russia that are far from Moscow and it gives these children an extra message of love,"" she told CNN. Vodianova was born on February 28 1982 in Nizhni Novgorod, the fourth largest city in Russia. She lived in a poor district of the city with her mother and two sisters, one of whom has cerebral palsy. Watch Natalia Vodianova take CNN on a tour of Moscow Â» . The young Vodianova was regularly taken to the opera and the ballet by her grandparents. They offered some respite from the troubles at home and taught her the importance of manners. When Vodianova was 11 she began to help out on the family's fruit stall, and at the age of 15 she had moved into her own apartment with her best friend. ""It was a lot of survival and a lot of struggling but overall we were a good team,"" Vodianova told CNN. ""We worked really hard, all of us, and stood up for each other. My mum was amazing -- she lived for us. I appreciate what she has done for me and the way she raised me"" In 1999 a Parisian model scout held an open casting in Nizhni Novgorod. Vodianova impressed him and he sent her to Paris to sign with Viva Models on the condition that she learn English within three months. Luckily for her she took his advice. A year later Vodianova would find herself settled in Paris and sitting at a dinner party in the Pompidou Center restaurant. It was there she met artistic, English aristocratic playboy the Honorable Justin Portman, third son of the late Viscount Edward Henry Berkeley Portman. See Natalia Vodianova's life in front of the camera. Â» . The Portman family is one of the wealthiest in Britain, owning over 100 acres of prime land in central London and 3000 acres in Herefordshire, as well as expansive properties in Antigua and Australia. The pair fell in love and after a quick civil wedding Vodianova gave birth to their first child, Lucas, in December 2001, when she was still only 19. Vodianova lost a huge amount of weight after the birth and just a few weeks later at the castings for Paris Fashion Week she was the clear favorite among the designers. She opened and closed the prestigious Yves Saint Laurent show, as well as 40 other runway bookings and landed a Gucci perfume campaign, shot by iconic fashion photographer Mario Testino. On September 1 2002 Vodianova and Portman were married again, this time in a ceremony at St Vladimir's Cathedral in St Petersburg, followed by a lavish reception for 110 guests at the Palace of Catherine the Great. Over the next few years two more children followed. Her daughter Neva was born in March 2006 and another son, Viktor, was born in September 2007. Vodianova still found time to walk the runway for the world's great fashion houses, including Chanel, Givenchy, Versace, Balenciaga, Prada, Ralph Lauren, Christian Lacroix, Dolce & Gabbana, Gucci and her good friend Diane Von Furstenberg. She ""officially"" retired from the catwalk after Valentino's emotional final show, during the Spring/Summer 2008 season. Afterwards, Vodianova took Valentino for a well-deserved holiday to her much-loved city of Moscow. ""Moscow is the heart of my country so it gathers the best of what I love about my country - and I can find it all here in this place. I love the people, I love what I find here, I love being here and it's sad that I don't actually live here. It would be my dream"" Vodianova told CNN. Following a brief return to the catwalk for Diane Von Furstenberg and Balenciaga at the end of 2008 the supermodel is now fronting campaigns for Calvin Klein and David Yurman jewelry. At the age of 27 Natalia Vodianova has achieved more than most people could ever dream of. She's got age on her side, as well as beauty, fame and fortune, and yet she remains admirably grounded. ""The most important things to me are my children, my family and my husband. It's really about people in general -- I really love people and I try to never say no if someone needs my help.""","Russian supermodel Natalia Vodianova grew up in a poor neighborhood .

"Belfast, Northern Ireland (CNN) -- Fresh pro-British protests erupted Saturday in the Northern Ireland city of Belfast, police said, hours after nine officers were hurt in rioting. Tensions have been high since city council members there voted a month ago to stop flying the Union flag year-round, restricting it instead to certain days. Officers came under sustained attack in east Belfast from more than 100 people, some throwing fireworks and bricks, the Police Service of Northern Ireland said Saturday. The violence continued into the night. Police said they deployed water cannon and fired plastic bullets and that a number of arrests were made. Authorities were also investigating reports that a number of shots were fired at police lines. Friday night, more than 30 petrol bombs were thrown at officers during serious disorder in the same part of the city. Officers were also pelted with ball bearings, fireworks and masonry, police said. Eight officers were hurt. Another officer was hurt Friday in the Newtownabbey area, police said, where bottles and bricks were thrown at police in the course of a protest lasting several hours. Police have arrested more than 20 people in connection with the disorder. A lunchtime demonstration outside City Hall appeared to pass without trouble. Northern Ireland's political leaders have called for an end to the pro-British protests, which were prompted by the vote on the Union flag of the United Kingdom. The disorder follows a summer of heightened tensions between Northern Ireland's Catholic and Protestant communities. Riots in September left dozens of police officers hurt. The recent violence follows more than a decade during which Northern Ireland has made steady progress toward lasting peace and stability. More: Policewoman targeted as tensions rise .

"Washington (CNN) -- Several key U.S. senators on Wednesday tore into private contractors working in Afghanistan for the company formerly known as Blackwater, accusing them of flouting regulations and endangering the U.S. mission. One of the keys to beating the Taliban in Afghanistan is the ability of U.S. forces to win support from the Afghan people, many of whom do not distinguish between U.S. contractors and the U.S. military, Sen. Carl Levin, D-Michigan, said during a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing. A top executive at Xe Services, the new name for Blackwater, acknowledged past mistakes on the part of the company's contractors. He asserted in testimony before the committee that the company is now ""reformed"" and operates ""with a different approach."" Levin, the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, said that if the United States is going to win the war in Afghanistan, ""we need to know that our contractor personnel are adequately screened, supervised, and held accountable -- because in the end the Afghan people will hold us responsible for their actions."" He also warned that ""if we don't fix the problems of oversight and make sure contractors like Blackwater play by the rules and live up to their commitments -- we'll be doing a disservice to our troops by making their already difficult and dangerous job even more so."" Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Missouri, said the U.S. mission is experiencing setbacks because of the lack of oversight of military contractors. ""We have two sets of rules and one image,"" she said. Until that changes, ""we're going to continue to be stalled on progress in terms of accomplishing this mission."" The committee's top Republican, Arizona Sen. John McCain, agreed with Levin's and McCaskill's assessment. ""Given the stakes and the primary focus of our counterinsurgency strategy to protect the Afghan people, we must not tolerate gross misbehavior or criminal misconduct by individual civilian contractor employees,"" McCain said. ""We cannot afford to tolerate lax oversight by the government entities directly responsible for policing these companies and civilian employees in Afghanistan."" Though more than 100,000 contractors operate for a variety of contractors in Afghanistan, the senators singled out Paravant, a company with ""no meaningful distinction"" from Xe Services, Levin said. Levin cited a December 9, 2008, shooting at the U.S. military's range at Camp Darulaman during which a Paravant program manager carrying an AK-47 got on the back of a moving car, then shot and wounded a Paravant trainer on his team when the car hit a bump, Levin said. Though the program manager lost his job, the others on his team who allowed his activities did not, he said. Combined Security Transition Command-Afghanistan, a multinational military formation that trains the Afghan National Army, did not appear to have investigated the incident, he said. Had it done so, the U.S. Army ""would have seen that Paravant personnel were using weapons improperly and unsafely, with inadequate supervision, and that they were carrying weapons that they weren't even supposed to have,"" according to Levin. He also cited a widely reported May 5, 2009, incident in which two Paravant personnel fired their weapons, killing two Afghan civilians and wounding a third. The two men have been charged with murder in connection with the shootings. An Army investigation appeared to find that the contract personnel had ""violated alcohol consumption policies, were not authorized to possess weapons, violated use-of-force rules and violated movement-control policies,"" said Levin, who cited as his source the man who then led the Combined Security Transition Command-Afghanistan. Paravant's contract required it to ""ensure that its personnel ... behave at all times in accordance with the highest professional and ethical standards,"" he added. Records for the two men responsible for the May 5 shooting show the company failed to properly vet them, Levin said. One man's military record ""apparently included assault, insubordinate conduct, absence without leave, failure to obey order or regulation, larceny and wrongful appropriation,"" he said. And his criminal record showed convictions for reckless driving, disturbing the peace, assault and battery, driving while intoxicated, resisting arrest and trespassing. The other man was cited in a news report for having been discharged from the U.S. military after being absent without leave for 22 days and testing positive for cocaine, Levin said. Other Paravant personnel were fired for alcohol use and drug use, he said. During his opening statement before the committee, Xe Services Vice President Fred Roitz acknowledged the company's culpability in the incident. ""The independent contractors' actions that night clearly violated company policies against use of alcohol, unauthorized use of official vehicles, and taking weapons outside the training area,"" he said. ""Those contractors are being held accountable by the law, as they should be."" Roitz also noted that three individuals involved in the May 2009 shootings had been relieved of their responsibilities prior to the incident. He conceded, however, that ""Paravant's policies and procedures were not followed because of failures by Paravant's prior management."" Paravant's ""leadership reported to me at the time, and I accept my share of the responsibility,"" he said. ""That leadership and company director failed to keep me adequately informed that well-established, basic policies and practices were not being followed."" Roitz, in his statement, told the committee members that ""the new Xe Services would act differently today. We simply will not send our personnel overseas without a proper authorization for a weapon (where needed) and without full compliance with all requirements."" He said the company has ""put in place new leadership and procedures to help ensure this commitment is kept."" After the shootings, Raytheon, which had subcontracted the work to Paravant, accused the company of having failed to properly oversee its personnel. Paravant responded that it would need more money to do that, Levin said, calling the company's response ""deeply troubling"" since its contractual obligation already called for that. In addition, Paravant called its personnel ""independent contractors,"" despite ""compelling evidence"" that they were company employees, Levin said. That meant that the company withheld no income taxes and paid no Social Security, Medicare, or unemployment tax for them, he said. The Internal Revenue Service is currently considering Paravant's classification. Levin also took to task the U.S. Army for ""apparent lack of contractor oversight."" Before last May's shooting, the Army said it had no contracting officer representative in the area, telling the committee that it relied on a Dutch contractor to oversee the project. The Army said it also monitored the contractors from an office in Florida by calling the chief of training and education for the Afghan National Security Forces at Combined Security Transition Command-Afghanistan. But the chief has told the committee that he did not travel to the training sites to observe Paravant's personnel, Levin said. On December 3, 2008, prior to the first shooting incident, Raytheon told the Army by e-mail that Paravant workers had weapons without authority, Levin said, but the Army ""apparently failed to take action."" Raytheon issued a statement Wednesday in response to the hearing. ""The contract for these services, including sub-contracting support, was addressed through a competitive bidding, evaluation and selection process that involved our customer. Paravant employees subsequently violated policies of their contract which led to our termination of the relationship for cause last year. ""Raytheon has been working closely with our customers to enhance controls, procedures and oversight of contractor and subcontractor personnel. We will continue to work with our customers to ensure that strong oversight supports the success of our training services programs,"" the statement said. A separate report released earlier this month by the inspectors general of the Department of Defense and the State Department criticizes the State Department for its oversight of Afghan training contracts, specifically a $1 billion contract to train Afghan National Police. The State Department failed to keep track of the money and materials, including weapons, and failed to prepare the police to fight off insurgents, the report said. Additionally, Levin said a key mission of U.S. forces in Afghanistan is to train and equip Afghan security forces to take the lead in the war, adding that they use a U.S.-operated facility near Kabul to store weapons for the Afghan forces. Though no policy exists that allows contractors or subcontractors to use weapons stored at the site, called Bunker 22, Blackwater personnel ""acquired several hundred weapons, including more than 500 AK-47s, from the facility on multiple occasions,"" Levin said. Though the company said last June that it had returned them all, Levin said that was not the case, citing one AK-47 that was not returned until late last month. ""These are weapons that belonged to the Afghan National Police -- not Blackwater,"" he said. ""And it is only on the eve of this hearing that the company is giving the majority of them back to the Afghan government."" Levin concluded his opening remarks by saying that the contractors need to understand that they have an impact on how the U.S. military is perceived. ""Even one irresponsible act by contractor personnel can hurt the mission and put our troops in harm's way,"" he said.

"Tripoli, Libya (CNN) -- A threat targeting the eastern Libyan city of Benghazi has allegedly surfaced after last week's bloody hostage crisis in neighboring Algeria. But while Libya has ratcheted up its protection of Benghazi and its nearby oil fields, its government downplayed the situation on Thursday. ""The Ministry of Interior strongly denies existence of threats against the stabilities and security of the Western citizens and residents who live in Benghazi, and assure that the Benghazi security situation is stable,"" said a statement from the official Libyan news agency. ""Terrorism has no religion or country,"" said Jumma Atiga, a high-ranking Libyan politician. ""Terrorism can strike anywhere in the world, even ...countries like Britain, aren't immune to terrorism. But to have this announcement that hints at something that doesn't really exist on the ground, is not justified enough, in our opinion."" But concerns have sparked warnings from foreign entities with people in the North African nation. Algeria forces try to settle hostage crisis . ""We are now aware of a specific and imminent threat to Westerners in Benghazi, and urge any British nationals who remain there against our advice to leave immediately,"" Britain said Thursday. ""Although there is no specific information pointing to specific, imminent threats against U.S. citizens, the potential for violence and kidnappings targeting Westerners in Benghazi is significant,"" the U.S. State Department said in a warning for American citizens Thursday. ""The United States continues to advise against all travel to Benghazi. At least two other diplomatic missions have advised their citizens to leave Benghazi immediately."" The deadly siege by jihadis at the remote Algerian gas plant has generated fears that a similar attack could happen in Libya. The militants reportedly attacked the Algerian facility because Algeria permitted France to use its air space to attack militants in Mali. Opinion: Algeria hostage crisis shows jihadists on rise . Libyan commanders have called in pro-government militias, or ""revolutionaries"" from the city of Zintan to help protect oil fields. ""As a result of the circumstances Algeria and Niger are going through and the fallout from the Mali crisis, we should be completely ready for any urgent situation that could happen in the area,"" said Col. Ahmad al-Khabasheh, southern regional commander of Libya's Petroleum Protection Faculty. The force is tasked with protecting the oil fields on the Tunisian, Algerian and Niger borders, Al-Khabasheh said. Fighters and the security forces are poised inside and outside oil fields. Broken limbs, torn lives in northern Mali . The commander said they won't permit any act to affect ""the safety and sovereignty of Libya."" Guards are using military air support and have formed a special operations room. Libyan Prime Minister Ali Zidan said Libya has closed borders against an influx of immigrants, along Sudan, Chad, Niger and Algeria in December. But the locations are porous. He said the country won't be used for operations threatening neighbors. Intelligence suggests that attacks may mirror last week's hostage situation in Algeria. Security in Benghazi is working on implanting security in the city. and an overnight curfew is being considered, authorities said. Five things we learned from Benghazi hearings . The International News Safety Institute, a coalition of groups devoted to journalists' safety, said credible sources alerted the group that ""terrorist organizations may be planning to attack oil fields in Libya,"" with attacks threatening to mirror the Algerian hostage-taking. ""The majority of the oil fields are located in eastern Benghazi, where Islamist groups are pushing for separation from Tripoli as early as mid-February. It is not clear whether this current warning is related to the mid-February issue,"" the INSI said. The Netherlands is asking citizens not to travel to Benghazi or stay there. Germany asked its citizens to leave Benghazi and the surrounding area, citing knowledge of a specific threat. Air Malta canceled its Thursday flights between Benghazi and Malta. ""We strongly encourage all U.S. citizens to take appropriate precautions as the security situation in Libya is volatile,"" the U.S. State Department said.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- House and Senate negotiators Monday announced an agreement on a giant $662 billion defense authorization bill, including modifications to its detainee language they hope will address White House concerns about that section and avoid a possible veto by President Barack Obama. In particular, the lawmakers added language to make clear that nothing in the bill requiring military custody of al Qaeda suspects would interfere with the ability of civilian law enforcement to carry out terrorism investigations and interrogations in the United States. ""We felt there was ample assurance in the Senate bill that there would be no interference with civilian interrogations and investigations. We had a number of provisions in the Senate bill to make sure that was not the case,"" said Sen. Carl Levin, D-Michigan, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee. ""However, there were some people who raised concerns that there was interference with FBI or other civilian authorities in terms of their operations. That was not our intent. That was not our language. But we added some significant provisions to reassure everybody that that is not the case. ""We took significant steps to address the administration's concerns in those areas,"" said Rep. Adam Smith, D-Washington, the top Democrat on the House Armed Services Committee. ""We had numerous meetings with the administration, we had a meeting with the director of the FBI. We feel like we were able to satisfy, we hope, most of their concerns,"" said Sen. John McCain of Arizona, the top Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee. ""This does not change existing law and this legislation includes a national security waiver if the president chooses to exercise it."" The waiver would allow the president to transfer a suspect from military to civilian custody if he chooses. The lawmakers also agreed on tough sanctions language for the Iranian Central Bank, aimed at punishing Iran for its nuclear program. The White House had expressed opposition to that provision as well but it received broad support in Congress so lawmakers are hopeful the president will accept the language. The measure ""will put real additional pressure on the Iranians so they are going to pay a bigger and bigger price, if they continue to move towards nuclear weapons,"" Levin said. In addition, lawmakers agreed to tough new restrictions on Pakistan to ensure that country is not participating in the manufacture and transport of improvised explosive devices -- those hidden bombs that have caused havoc for coalition forces in Afghanistan. ""We've had some shaky relations with Pakistan lately. We need them, and they need us,"" said Rep. Buck McKeon, R-California, the chair of the House Armed Services Committee. ""We have frozen some of the money that we will be sending to Pakistan until they offer more assurances, more help in this area of ... fertilizer and the things that go into making IEDs,"" McKeon said. The House could take up the bill as early as Wednesday and the Senate soon after, the lawmakers said.","Detainee language is structured to avoid a possible veto by Obama .

"(CNN) -- Given that Moscow has been home to the likes of Tchaikovsky, Dostoyevsky, Rachmaninoff and Pushkin, it's no surprise that the city offers a wealth of cultural events. But Muscovites are also prepared to brave their bitter winters to enjoy traditional outdoor celebrations. Pancakes, known as blini, are the stars of the Maslenitsa Festival. Maslenitsa Festival/Blini Week (February/March) This traditional festival, with its roots in pagan Spring celebrations, all but disappeared between 1917 and 2002, but it's now one of the city's best-loved celebrations. It precedes Lent and Russian pancakes, known as blini, feature prominently in the week-long festivities. Round, golden blini are said to symbolize the Spring sun and are eaten in huge quantities all week, topped with anything from jam to caviar. The festival usually includes an attempt to break a blini-related world record; in 2004 the festival set the record for the tallest pile of pancakes ever made and at the 2008 festival bakers created a map of the world out of, you guessed it, blini. Other festival shenanigans include traditional Slavic games, troika (sled) rides, folk dancing, and a final-day masquerade and parade made up of musicians, jesters, stiltwalkers, acrobats, and carnival entertainers. The traditional ""Maslenitsa brawl,"" an apparently good-natured group fist-fight, is probably best avoided. See Natalia Vodianova's Moscow. Â» . Golden Mask Festival (March/April) Each year Russia's finest opera, dance, theater and musical productions compete to win a coveted Golden Mask award at Moscow's Golden Mask Festival. Held over three weeks at venues around the city, the festival is a fantastic opportunity to experience the best in contemporary culture from all over Russia, conveniently gathered together in one city. What do you think are Moscow's seasonal highlights? Let us know below. Victory Day (9 May) Victory Day is a national holiday in Russia to commemorate Germany's surrender to the Soviet Union in World War II -- still known in Russia as the ""Great Patriotic War."" In Moscow, the day is marked by an impressive military parade in Red Square and remembrance events in Victory Park to honor Russia's fallen soldiers. There are firework displays in the evening. Part somber remembrance, part celebration, Victory Day is a dramatic reminder of what many Russians still regard as the Soviet Union's proudest hour, and of the millions of Russians killed in the war. December Nights (December) Just as Moscow's December chill is turning nights on the town into an endurance contest, the Pushkin Museum of Fine Arts comes to the rescue with a series of outstanding evenings of classical music. Conceived by renowned Russian pianist Svyatoslav Richter and held annually since 1981, December Night's program of Russian and international musical talent is one of the year's cultural highlights. As well as world-class classical concerts, the festival also features exhibitions of artworks related to that year's musical theme. Winter Festival (late December/early January) Given the ferocity of Moscow's winter, if you're planning to join in with the Winter Festival fun in Izmailovo Park you'd do well to warm up with a shot or two of vodka before you venture outside. In the park you'll find traditional folk music, dancing, and troika rides, while elsewhere in the city you can see glittering ice sculptures being built in Red Square and hundreds of snowmen lining Arbat Street. While some hardy Muscovites use the festival as an opportunity to join the ""Walrus Club,"" it isn't recommended -- membership involves swimming in ice holes carved in the freezing Moscow River.","Moscow hosts a wealth of cultural events as well as traditional outdoor festivities .

"(CNN) -- Former World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) president Dick Pound has warned it is not just cycling that needs to crack down on the use of performance-enhancing substances. As cycling's governing body the UCI grapples with the fallout of the Lance Armstrong doping scandal -- which has resulted in the American being stripped of his seven Tour de France titles -- Pound called for every sport to remain vigilant. ""I think every sport is at risk,"" the former International Olympic Committee vice president told CNN. ""They use different drugs in different sports: track and field, swimming, weightlifting, football has had it -- pick a sport and you could probably determine which drugs are the drugs of choice."" Pound also insisted that unless the UCI acted decisively, cycling could be irreversibly damaged. ""It could be a watershed moment -- you hope that the UCI will stop trying to blame everyone else rather than themselves,"" added Pound. ""We have to get this act together very quickly, because it is entirely likely that this was not the only team in the peloton involved in organizing cheating,"" referring to the United States Anti-Doping Agency's conclusion that the U.S. Postal Service team and Armstrong had run ""the most sophisticated, professionalized and successful doping program that sport has ever seen"". ""If they don't get their act together, it could spin out of control. ""Sponsors are already dropping out for teams, individual sponsors have dropped Armstrong while the Spanish, Italians, Germans will be wondering if some of their people are doing some of this. ""When you see how pervasive the system of cheating was in one team -- this was probably not the only place it happened. You wonder where else it happened."" Despite the extraordinary weight of evidence produced by the USADA and UCI chief Pat McQuaid arguing Armstrong ""deserves to be forgotten in cycling now,"" the Texan has maintained his innocence, . Pound has been a strong critic of the UCI, suggesting there is no way the organization could have been completely in the dark regarding the use of banned substances in cycling. The Canadian was sued by the UCI in 2007, after his term as WADA president had come to an end, for comments he made criticizing the body's former president Hein Verbruggen. An out of court settlement was reached in 2009, with Pound acknowledging some of his comments could have been perceived as excessive but that he had felt the UCI's actions had been insufficient. Operation Puerto . Pound argues that Operation Puerto shows just how systematic doping had become in cycling. Operation Puerto was an investigation -- started by the Spanish police in May 2006 -- into the doping ring led by Doctor Eufemiano Fuentes, which involved high-profile cyclists such as Ivan Basso and Tyler Hamilton. ""Operation Puerto has been stalled because of Spanish bureaucracy -- probably because of the damning involvement of the Spanish doctors involved,"" explained Pound. Against a backdrop of the lurid doping headlines, the route for the 2013 Tour de France was announced on Wednesday at an event in Paris ahead of the 100th edition of the grueling race. For the first time in 10 years, each of the Tour's 21 stages will take place within the France, with the riders starting on Corsica, before completing the 3,360 kilometer marathon with a tradition dash along the iconic Champs Elysees on July 21. Tour director Christian Prudhomme insisted the unveiling of the race route was a time to talk about the magic of the Tour rather than the issue of doping, although he insisted: ""A movement has started a few years ago and it must go on. Everybody must work on it."" Prudhomme also argued that the Tour titles taken away from Spaniard Alberto Contador and American Floyd Landis for doping offenses suggested the current tests do work. Team Sky dominated the 2012 race, with Bradley Wiggins becoming the first Briton to win the title, with his compatriot and teammate Chris Froome coming second. But it could be difficult for Wiggins to defend his title, with many observers already suggesting the 32-year-old could struggle with 2013's comparatively hilly route.","Former WADA chief Richard Pound says sport must crack down on doping .

"(CNN) -- Togo booked its place in the quarterfinals of the Africa Cup of Nations for the first time in seven attempts following a nervy draw with Tunisia in South Africa Wednesday. With the game level at 1-1, Tunisia's Khalid Mouelhi had a glorious opportunity to win the tie with 15 minutes remaining when his side was awarded a penalty kick. But having already scored from the spot earlier in the game to cancel out Serge Gakpe's opener for Togo, Mouehli failed to repeat the feat as Tunisia's bowed out. The achievement comes three years after two members of the Togo squad were killed in a deadly machine attack in the oil-rich enclave of Cabinda before the 2010 Nations Cup. Captain Emmanuel Adebayor, who hid under a seat when the Togo team bus came under fire from separatists, revealed the team would hold prayers for the pair which lost their lives . ""I'm thinking of them,"" he told reporters. ""We're going to take five minutes to pray for them at the hotel.""

Trabelsi told reporters in Nelspruit: ""We did what we had to do, we dominated the play, but we lacked a bit of finishing. ""I'm not here to talk about the referee -- I'm here to talk about my team. Am I satisfied with the outcome? Not really."" Togo made the perfect start by taking the lead on 13 minutes when Emmanuel Adebayor's through ball sent Gakpe clear to fire home. Cape Verde's 'Special One' With Tunisia needing to win the game to advance, Trabelsi's men fought back and deservedly drew level when Mouelhi converted from 12-yards following a foul on Esperance midfielder Hichri. Tunisia continued to look for that elusive winner after the break, but only the crossbar denied Adebayor from heading Togo back in front with 21 minutes remaining. What can we expect from the 2013 Africa Cup of Nations? The Carthage Eagles were given a real lifeline on 75 minutes when South African referee Daniel Bennett pointed to the penalty spot following a foul on Saber Khalifa. Mouelhi stood up to strike the kick, but his effort hit the left post as Togo held out for the draw. ""This is huge for Togo -- the first time they have qualified for the quarterfinals,"" Togo coach Didier Six told reporters. ""We were the little team in this group, and we've made it. I think there will be a big party in Lome tonight."" Zambia dumped out of Africa Cup of Nations . Ivory Coast . Meanwhile, tournament favorite Ivory Coast came from two goals down to draw 2-2 with Algeria in Rustenburg. Ivory Coast, which had already qualified for the last eight, will face Nigeria in the next round. With his side already through to the next stage, coach Sabri Lamouchi made nine changes to the team to face an Algeria team without any chance of making the quarterfinals. Ryad Boudebouz had a great early chance to give Algeria the lead but struck his seventh minute penalty against the post. Algeria was awarded a second spot kick on 64 minutes and Sofiane Feghouli made no mistake before Hilal Soudani doubled his side's lead soon after. But two goals in four minutes from Didier Drogba and Wilfried Bony saved embarrassment and ensured Ivory Coast finished the group stage unbeaten. ""I am proud of my boys because they refused to give up when two goals behind,"" Ivory Coast coach Lamouchi told reporters. ""I congratulate Algeria, who did not make it easy for us and are a team to watch in the future. ""The failure of all the north African teams to make the next round surprises me. I am most disappointed about the departure of Tunisia, which is where my family originates from.""","Togo will face Burkina Faso in quarterfinal following 1-1 draw with Tunisia .

"Moscow (CNN) -- A judge in Moscow has found former Russian oil tycoon Mikhail Khodorkovsky and his business partner guilty of corruption charges, his lawyer said Monday. Khodorkovsky's son, Pavel, later told CNN that his father will appeal the verdict. ""Of course there will be an appeal,"" Pavel Khodorkovsky said. ""What I'm hoping for right now is the shortest sentence possible, because I'm really hoping to see my dad as soon as possible a free man."" The trial on money laundering and embezzlement charges, which began in March 2009, was the second for the two men. Khodorkovsky could be sentenced to prison until 2017. ""The trial was a charade of justice, the charges were absolutely false, but I fear the sentencing will be very real,"" lead defense lawyer Vadim Klyuvgant said in a written statement. Khodorkovsky, the former head of the Yukos oil company, and his business partner, Platon Lebedev, were charged with embezzlement and laundering of stolen property. They are accused of stealing billions of dollars' worth of oil from Yukos production subsidiaries from 1998 to 2003. Khodorkovsky has already been convicted of underpaying taxes on the oil. Ahead of the verdict, hundreds of supporters gathered outside the central Moscow courthouse. Security officers, who maintained a heavy presence outside the building, whisked several people away while others stood in below-freezing temperatures chanting ""Freedom"" and ""Russia without Putin"" -- referring to the prime minister. Khodorkovsky had expressed a desire to run for office at one time and funded opposition political parties. He has said the trial was part of a Kremlin campaign to destroy him and take the company he built from privatization deals of the 1990s. The Kremlin has denied any role. Pavel Khodorkovsky said that he had been expecting a guilty verdict for his father, but also ""had hoped that President (Dmitry) Medvedev's rhetoric about judicial system reform would actually bear some fruit."" ""However, today, I realize that the judge is completely subservient and is a slave to the political will of Mr. (Russian Prime Minister Vladimir) Putin and other bureaucrats in the Kremlin,"" the younger Khodorkovsky said. A White House statement Monday also criticized the case, saying it ""appears to be an abusive use of the legal system for improper ends."" ""The apparent selective application of the law to these individuals undermines Russia's reputation as a country committed to deepening the rule of law,"" said the statement by White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs,. The statement added that the United States would continue monitoring developments in the case. In a separate statement, U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said the conviction ""raises serious questions about selective prosecution -- and about the rule of law being overshadowed by political considerations."" ""This and similar cases have a negative impact on Russia's reputation for fulfilling its international human rights obligations and improving its investment climate,"" Clinton's statement said. The court was originally scheduled to read the verdict in the trial on December 15, but it was unexpectedly postponed. The Yukos oil company was once Russia's largest oil producer. Khodorkovsky is serving an eight-year sentence for fraud and tax evasion, having underpaid taxes on the oil his company produced. Yukos was later broken up and absorbed by the state. Khodorkovsky has already told the Moscow court that its decision will have an impact far beyond him and Lebedev. ""There is much more than just the fates of two people in your hands,"" Khodorkovsky said. ""Right here and right now, the fate of every citizen of our country is being decided."" In October, prosecutors asked for a 14-year prison sentence but said it should include the eight-year term that Khodorkovsky is already serving, which will end in October 2011. With time served, the sentence could keep Khodorkovsky in jail until 2017. The former oil magnate was previously incarcerated in a work camp near the town of Krasnokamensk, 6,500 kilometers (4,000 miles) from his native Moscow, but when the new charges were brought against the two men, both were moved to Moscow last year to stand trial. The court also ordered Khodorkovsky and Lebedev to pay about $600 million in back taxes. Few doubt that Khodorkovsky's prosecution has taken on a symbolism far beyond his own innocence or guilt. Critics say the embezzlement charges against him are absurd; analysts say Russia itself, and its commitment to the rule of law, is on trial. ""This verdict will be a verdict on whether Russia is a law-governed state, or whether it ever aspires to become one,"" said Masha Lipman of the Carnegie Endowment, ""because currently it is not a law-governed state and the trial of Khodorkovsky and his partner Lebedev is the most striking example of it."" In his final address to the court, Khodorkovsky made a last impassioned appeal. ""For me, as for anybody, it is hard to live in jail, and I do not want to die there. But if I have to, I will not hesitate. The things I believe in are worth dying for,"" he said. CNN's Maxim Tkachenko contributed to this report.","NEW: Khodorkovsky's son says his father will appeal .

"Woodward, Oklahoma (CNN) -- The death toll from a weekend tornado in Woodward, Oklahoma rose to six Monday with the death of a critically injured man in the hospital, a city official said. The man, whose name has not been released, died at a hospital in Amarillo, Texas, about 160 miles away, Woodward emergency manager Matt Lehenbauer said. His wife remains hospitalized in critical condition, Lehenbauer said. The storm struck after midnight Sunday, taking aim at the Hidden Valley Mobile Home Park in Woodward, killing Frank Hobbie and his two young daughters, ages 5 and 7. Two other victims, Derrin Juul and a 10-year-old girl presumed to be Juul's daughter, died when powerful winds rolled their car several times, Woodward Mayor Roscoe Hill said. The Woodward storm was one of dozens of tornadoes believed to have been spawned by a furious storm system that wreaked havoc across large swaths of 10 states in the Midwest and Plains over the weekend. The only known casualties occurred in the northern Oklahoma city of about 12,000, about 85 miles west of Enid. At least 29 people were injured, officials said. By early Monday, the National Weather Service lifted the last of widespread tornado watches in Minnesota, Wisconsin, Arkansas, Iowa and Illinois after threats of another furious outbreak of tornadoes never materialized. Strong thunderstorms remained a possibility during the early morning hours, the service said. The weather service's Storm Prediction Center received 10 reports of tornadoes Sunday -- the last a reported touchdown in McLeod County in Minnesota -- and 122 reports of tornadoes Saturday. Officials credited working early warning systems elsewhere in the region with preventing more fatalities. Advisories from the system were issued two days in advance, rather than just hours, and were ""remarkably accurate,"" said Kansas Gov. Sam Brownback. ""People took it very seriously."" But in Woodward, Oklahoma, where 89 homes and 13 businesses were destroyed, the storm took out the transmitter for the tornado warning siren system. ""We lost our manual override"" when the electricity was knocked out, City Manager Alan Riffel said. Given that and timing of the tornado -- after midnight, and after other severe weather had barreled through -- Oklahoma Gov. Mary Fallin said, the human cost could have been even worse. ""It's remarkable that we didn't have more loss of life in Woodward,"" she said late Sunday afternoon. Fallin has declared a state of disaster emergency in 12 counties in order to help expedite resources. In southwest Iowa, residents of Thurman were digging through debris after a tornado struck Saturday. ""About 75% of the homes are damaged or destroyed,"" said Mike Crecelius, Fremont County's emergency management director. Four truckers whose rigs were blown off Interstate 29, by the same tornado that struck Thurman, were the only ones hospitalized with storm-related injuries, the weather service said. The agency reported the twister had winds between 111 and 135 mph as it caused a half-mile-long damage path over 10 miles. Earlier, a confirmed tornado struck a hospital in Creston, Iowa, blowing out windows and damaging the roof, said John Benson of the Iowa Homeland Security and Emergency Management agency. There were no major injuries reported, and patients were relocated to other area hospitals. One of the biggest cities hit over the weekend was Wichita, Kansas, where resident Katie Sykes said torrential rains produced a ""river in my front yard"" and the prospect of a tornado had her shuddering in fear. ""When I was little, we prepared for storms, hearing the sirens and then going to the basement. And going through this experience, I felt like a little kid, young and scared,"" Sykes said. A tornado churned across the southern part of the city, home to a number of aircraft-related manufacturers. The tornado struck Boeing and Sprit AeroSystems, officials said. A few hundred employees were working at a Spirit Aero Systems plant, producing fuselages and other equipment for Boeing aircraft, said company spokesman Ken Evans, when a twister came through and caused the roof to collapse. No one was injured, and workers have been told not to come in until Wednesday as the damage is assessed. CNN's Rob Marciano reported from Oklahoma and Maria P. White from Atlanta.","NEW: Death toll rises to six in Woodward, Oklahoma .

"(CNN) -- Lionel Messi needed just 25 minutes to dispel any doubts that he would break Gerd Muller's longstanding world record of 85 goals in a calendar year on Sunday. Having made a quick recovery from the midweek injury that threatened to curtail his bid, the Barcelona soccer star drew level with the German after 16 minutes of the Spanish league match against Real Betis. A mere nine minutes later, the 25-year-old added another accolade to his collection as he put Barcelona 2-0 ahead to surpass Muller's 1972 milestone with a possible three more matches to play in 2012. Fifth-placed Betis hit back before halftime through Ruben Castro, but could not prevent unbeaten league leaders Barcelona from registering a 14th win from 15 matches to extend the club's record start to the season. ""I've said it a lot -- it's nice to beat records but the win for the team is what is important and the points difference at the top,"" Messi told reporters after Barca retained a six-point lead over second-placed Atletico Madrid. Messi's next challenge is to become the first man to win the world player of the year award four times, as he heads the shortlist for January's ceremony along with clubmate Andres Iniesta and Real Madrid's Cristiano Ronaldo. ""If Iniesta wins, it will be well-deserved for all that he has done, for the way he plays. Again, it will also be a prize for the dressing room,"" Messi said of the Spain midfielder, who beat him to last season's top European award. Click here to see a map of Messi's first 84 goals of 2012 . He is already Barcelona's alltime leading scorer, having in March surpassed the 232 goal mark set by Cesar Rodriguez in the 1950s. Last season he scored a record 50 goals in La Liga, and he already has 23 this term. Of his 86 for 2012, 74 have been for Barcelona and 12 for his country. The world has yet to see the best of Messi on the international stage, as he has yet to win a senior title with Argentina -- and that is the challenge he next faces if is to be known as a true great, according to British football journalist Henry Winter. ""Pele did it for Brazil and Maradona for Argentina. In the 2014 World Cup on Brazilian soil it'll be wonderful to see Messi show the world what a special, special player he is,"" Winter told CNN on Sunday. Messi vs. Muller: The goal kings . ""They say top players hit their peak at 27 or 28 when they have the maturity and the game craft and still the athleticism of youth. I think we'll see a player like Messi who's very humble, very grounded, continuing to work and develop with the great Barcelona players he's got around him, like Xavi and Iniesta. ""He'll be the first to pay tribute to his teammates as well, because they are important."" Winter paid tribute to the humility of Messi, who became a father for the first time last month. ""He's a fantastic role model, not just for his club but for football generally,"" Winter said. ""He doesn't cheat -- he gets whacked by some serious tackles, but he's strong mentally physically -- even though he's not the tallest or most imposing of individuals. ""He just keeps going because he's got this great lust for goals, for scoring, for setting up his teammates. He's the ultimate team player, an ambassador on and off the pitch."" Messi's exploits came after it appeared he might be upstaged by Atletico Madrid's freescoring Radamel Falcao, who became the first player in more than a decade to net five times in a La Liga match. The Colombia international took his league tally to 16 this season as second-placed Atletico kept the pressure on leaders Barca with a 6-0 thrashing of bottom team Deportivo La Coruna. Falcao joined Ronaldo on 13 goals with a first-half double, then completed his hat-trick with a penalty after being fouled. He added two more to seal Atletico's eighth successive home win and guarantee that speculation about his future will intensify ahead of the January transfer window, with some of the world's biggest clubs interested in signing the 26-year-old former Porto player.","Barcelona soccer star Lionel Messi breaks world record for goals in a calendar year .

"(CNN) -- Marcel Hirscher continued his red-hot streak with a stunning victory at the Moscow parallel slalom Tuesday. The Austrian consolidated his lead at the top of the overall World Cup standings after overcoming Sweden's Andre Myhrer in the men's two-leg final. Hirscher, who also won at Kitzbuhel on Sunday, is now 214 points ahead of Norwegian rival Aksel Lund Svindal in the overall standings, and has all but assured himself victory in the race for the slalom's crystal globe. Hirscher turns it on for the Terminator . It was the second city event of the World Cup season, which is based in the mountain resorts of Europe and North America, and Hirscher made amends for being beaten by Felix Neureuther in Munich on New Year's Day. ""All in all I was ahead by less than half a second,"" Hirscher told reporters. ""It's very tough to win each race against so many great racers, but I was lucky today. The weather is cold and today there were almost perfect conditions for this competition. ""It was a good race for me but if some more spectators were to come to watch the race next year it would be really great for us."" The win was Hirscher's sixth of the season and 18th of his career, a feat which is certain to give him a huge lift going into the World Championships at Schladming, Austria, which start on February 4. ""It's a totally different event than what we normally ski,"" Hirscher said of the Moscow race, for which big ramps are constructed. ""If I had to compare it with my victory in Kitzbuhel, it might be less difficult to win in an event where there are 16 opposed to over 60 skiers, plus there was so much pressure on me for that victory which I was missing from Kitzbuhel. ""But, here you only have one chance to give 100%, things are so tight that unless you step up your game from heat to heat -- you are out!"" Svindal sets the Alpine speed standard . Meanwhile, Germany's Lena Duerr won the women's slalom after edging past Slovakia's Veronika Velez-Zuzulova.

"(LifeWire) -- Nikki Maxwell and her husband, Bill, used to enjoy date nights, a live-in nanny and frequent splurges. Expert says many couples aren't even aware of where their money is going. But in 2008, Nikki, a 39-year-old education grant writer, was laid off from her job with the state of California, and Bill, a 40-year-old freelance video game writer, was out of work for six months. Now the Los Angeles couple only spend money on food, housing and essentials for their children, ages 8, 6 and 3. Everything from gifts to health insurance has fallen by the wayside. ""Three years ago we were shopping at Whole Foods and Trader Joe's, and in 2008 we were at the food bank,"" Nikki says. ""We've had to make huge changes to our lifestyle. 'Cutting back' has been our mantra."" With the Bureau of Labor Statistics reporting in December that 10.3 million Americans are out of work, it's undoubtedly become the mantra of many couples -- married, cohabiting or otherwise. But how can you negotiate which expenses to jettison without throwing a wrench in your relationship? There's an art to making financial compromises as a couple. Budgeting is not a competitive sport . ""You need to approach this like partners, not adversaries,"" says consumer finance expert Dayana Yochim, author of ""The Motley Fool's Guide to Couples and Cash: How to Handle Money with Your Honey."" ""Your goal is not to defeat the other person, not to be the winner -- unless you like sleeping on the couch."" Nikki Maxwell agrees that teamwork is key. ""In the past, when one of us wanted a book, CD, DVD, et cetera, we would have to factor in that the other person would get to buy something of equal value,"" she says. ""Now we write down what we want to spend money on and discuss the choices for our family. It's not about him or me; it's about that bottom line."" That's not to say such negotiations come easily. ""I can see why arguments over money ruin marriages,"" Nikki says. ""It's tough."" Her husband, Bill, says the triaging is wearying. ""For us, it ends up not being as much about the cutbacks but about spending what little money we have,'' he says. ""And then you throw children into the mix who want to know why you didn't buy Popsicles this month. When you're in a mildly stressful state at best, that just kicks it over the edge.'' Maintain some autonomy . Julie Sturgeon, of Indianapolis, Indiana, has had trouble reaching any sort of agreement with her husband on cutting back. The couple, who have no children, have enjoyed plenty of extras. ""I think eating out seven nights a week is excessive,"" says the 46-year-old travel agent. ""He says for two people, it's too much of a time-suck to fix a meal, and it's not like we can't pay the resulting credit card at the end of the month."" They've also disagreed about which hobbies to ditch, which personal grooming expenses to drop and whether to reduce their donations to charity. ""We have a lot of guilt about what we think we should do,"" Sturgeon says. ""We're still paying our bills, so these conversations are more about mentally preparing ourselves in case that doesn't continue."" Ken Clark, a certified financial planner in Little Rock, Arkansas, says there's an easy solution to such stalemates. Outside of your fixed living expenses, ""Each person should have a little bit of money that they can spend each month without having to answer to anybody."" ""However hard you work to manage that money is up to you,"" says Clark, who's been in private practice since 2002 and has a master's degree in counseling psychology. ""This eliminates the quibbles over who's spending more on manicures or media purchases."" Cutting back 'brought us closer' But for some couples, trimming the budgetary fat is more of a bonding than head-butting experience. Just ask Dave Clarke, 25, a public relations professional in Philadelphia. While he and his girlfriend of 2 Â½ years don't live together, their lives are ""pretty intertwined."" ""We're young and don't make that much in the first place,"" he says. To adapt to higher food and gas prices in 2008 and ""make their money go farther,"" the two took stock of their spending habits as a couple. ""We nixed an annual fall weekend vacation,"" he says. They've also combined birthday and year-end holiday presents to each other, stopped buying pricey concert tickets and replaced dining out with cooking at home. ""It's actually brought us closer,"" he says. ""We're both fighting the same battle and know we have each other for support to fight it together."" Cutting back 101 . Regardless of whether you share bank accounts or live with your significant other, Yochim offers these suggestions for nipping financial squabbles in the bud: . â¢ Track your spending. ""A lot of couples don't even know where the money's going,"" she says. Free money management sites like Mint.com and QuickenOnline.com can change that. â¢ Establish ground rules. Determine which purchases you'll run past one another in advance -- for example, anything that costs more than $100. â¢ Don't split everything 50-50. If you're sharing bank accounts but one of you earns a considerably lower salary, deposit a percentage of your income into your joint account rather than the same dollar amount as your partner. â¢ Don't sweat the small stuff. Pick five ""big spending categories"" to cut back on as a couple.

"(CNN) -- Richard Gere is one of Hollywood's most recognizable and prolific movie stars. In a career spanning four decades, he's starred in more than 50 feature films, including blockbusters such as ""Pretty Woman"" and ""Runaway Bride."" In the early '80s, back-to-back performances in ""American Gigolo"" and ""An Officer and a Gentleman"" raised temperatures worldwide and cemented Gere's status as a heartthrob and sex symbol. But for all his accolades, one thing missing from the star's resume is an Academy Award. Many critics were certain a nomination would come for his memorable turn as Billy Flynn in the 2002 Best Picture Oscar winner, ""Chicago."" The movie musical earned a whopping 13 nominations, including acting nods for Renee Zellweger, Queen Latifah and John C. Reilly. It sent Catherina Zeta-Jones home with a statue -- but nothing for Gere. Hollywood has once again shifted into awards gear, and for the first time in a decade, the iconic leading man could get another swing at Oscar. This year, Gere flexed his dramatic muscles in Nicholas Jarecki's ""Arbitrage,"" playing a brilliant but troubled Wall Street tycoon. His performance has received widespread praise from critics as well as a Golden Globe nomination. With the film now available for home viewing and Oscar voters turning in their ballots, Gere opens up about what a nomination would mean to him; why things such as power, money and beauty don't really matter; and the best decision he's ever made about his hair. CNN: In ""Arbitrage,"" you play a hedge fund fat cat with a lot of personal and professional secrets. Since the economy took a nosedive, these guys are usually the villains, but somehow you make him sympathetic. Richard Gere: I wouldn't say he's sympathetic; I was trying to make him human. He does a lot of bad things, and I didn't want to sugarcoat that, but I don't know how you could sustain this story, if the guy was a capital ""V"" villain. The world has gray areas for all of us. We all compromise constantly. Most of us don't have the opportunity to compromise to the degree that this guy does with that much power and money, but the impulse is the same -- it's just a question of degree. That's what I wanted to do with this. I wanted to be a mirror for ourselves. CNN: In the first scene, you're celebrating your 60th birthday, and I thought, ""There's no way Richard Gere is 60!"" But you're 63. ... Gere: I'm actually 83. (Laughter) I'm very well-preserved. I had six hours of makeup before I came in here. CNN: That would be a headline. But seriously, aging in Hollywood is famously difficult, and you've managed to do it seamlessly. Gere: We were laughing about it before. Someone told me recently, ""Oh, you never colored your hair."" I know a lot of actors and directors who seem to get darker hair every year, and mine gets more paper white all the time. But I'm very glad I made that decision, and it seemed to work out. CNN: Was there a time in your life when you knew you had a certain impact on the opposite sex? Gere: Not at all. The only difference in my life over anyone else is that I've gone through this kind of scrutiny for a long time. But we all have hopes, fears, angers, jealousies -- we're all the same. It's like my character in the film; look at the package of this guy -- that car, those suits, the haircut, the mistress, the way he moves. In the end it's all meaningless. There are some core issues that we all go through. It doesn't matter how poor or rich or whatever, if you've done that kind of internal work that can open up genuine doors to selflessness -- which is the root of some kind of happiness that is real and that you can hold on to. That's the point. CNN: Some might say it's a bit easier to have that opinion when the surface looks so nice. Gere: Yeah, but nobody looks in the mirror and goes, ""Oooh, nice!"" CNN: Really? I might argue that point. Gere: Nobody. Nobody. Look, I've been married to two of the world's most beautiful women, and I never remember them looking in the mirror and going, ""Oooh, you look good."" It's all relative. CNN: There's a theory that the grumpy old men in the academy are jealous of matinee idols, like you, Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt, and that's why you don't win Oscars. It's only when you cross over behind the camera like George Clooney, Clint Eastwood and Robert Redford that they take you seriously. Have you heard of that? Gere: (Laughter) No. CNN: What would it mean to you to be nominated for your performance in ""Arbitrage""? Gere: It would feel great, of course. Everyone wants to feel appreciated. I like the movie, and I think Nick Jarecki, who wrote and directed it, did a really great job. I'm happy with my performance in it. I don't think any actor is ever totally delighted with what they do, but you get easier on it later. CNN: You've accomplished so much, but do you still dream and set goals for yourself? Gere: I've never wanted for something and then was able to make it happen. Life doesn't really work like that. I think the process of getting older is just to let it happen. While you're focused on trying to make something happen, you're missing out on so many other things around you. So I think in my own case the process of maturing is to just be more open -- to feel the whole thing.","Richard Gere's career spans four decades .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Lindsay Lohan's alleged lie to a police officer investigating a car crash last June could send the actress back to jail next month. But confusion surrounds the question of who will defend Lohan, 26, when she goes on trial February 27 after her longtime lawyer received a letter saying she was fired. ""Do you still represent Ms. Lohan?"" Los Angeles County Superior Court Commissioner Jane Godfrey asked attorney Shawn Holley in a hearing Tuesday. ""Yes, at this point, yes,"" said Holley, who has guided Lohan through dozens of court appearances over the last several years. ""We've got to get the representation issue nailed down,"" Godfrey said. ""The representation issue will be nailed down,"" Holley affirmed. Celebrity news website TMZ reported the letter to Holley came from an attorney in New York. Lohan, who was not required to attend Tuesday's arraignment, must be in court January 30 when the judge and lawyers prepare for next month's trial. She faces four misdemeanor charges relating to the traffic accident, but the most serious threat to Lohan's freedom is the probation revocation that the arrest triggered. She could be sent to jail for up to 245 days for violating her probation for a shoplifting conviction. Holley entered a ""not guilty"" plea on Lohan's behalf. The actress was put on probation after she was convicted in 2011 on charges related to the theft of a necklace. Lindsay Lohan: The reality show we don't want to watch . But then last summer, she crashed her car in Santa Monica. Authorities said not only was she driving recklessly, she also gave false information to a police officer and then resisted a police officer. The Santa Monica city attorney filed four misdemeanor charges against her, prompting a Los Angeles County Superior Court commissioner to revoke Lohan's probation last month. The case is just one in a long list of legal trouble for the actress, whose struggle with drugs and alcohol has seen her bounce in and out of court 19 times and to five rehabilitation facilities since 2007. In November, she was charged with misdemeanor assault after allegedly punching a woman at a Manhattan nightclub. In the Santa Monica case, Lohan is accused of telling police her assistant was driving the Porsche, while witnesses told investigators they saw Lohan behind the wheel.

"(CNN) -- Gunmen killed seven people Wednesday in Pakistan's southwestern Balochistan province, and two more died in a bomb blast in Karachi, police said. The Karachi explosion resulted from a bomb planted near an illegal gambling and drug center, according to police official Muhammad Aslam. It was not immediately clear who placed the bomb. In Balochistan, four people died in Loop Sherani when gunmen on two motorcycles sprayed a vehicle with what police official Abdul Jabbar Baloch called ""indiscriminate firing."" The shooting appeared to be a targeted killing, he said. In the other Balochistan incident, gunmen killed three people in Quetta, the provincial capital. Deputy Inspector General Wazir Khan Nasar said gunmen had earlier kidnapped the victims, who were later shot repeatedly in the head from close range. Balochistan, Pakistan's largest province, is routinely racked with violence. This month, 97 people have died in bombings in the province, leading to protests among Shiites who complain that the government has done too little to protect them. In addition to sectarian attacks on Shiites, unrest in the province is believed to be fomented by several insurgent groups, including the separatist Balochistan Liberation Army and the Pakistani Taliban. CNN's Shaan Khan contributed to this report.","NEW: Bomb blast kills two in Karachi .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Faulty electrical wiring is already suspected in the deaths of several U.S. troops in Iraq. Now contractors who worked in Afghanistan are reporting similar problems at American bases there. In July, Sen. Byron Dorgan held a hearing on troop electrocutions. He wants a faster response to the problem. ""In general, the electrical power systems in the camp can be described as a disaster waiting to happen,"" electrician Noris Rogers wrote to his bosses at military contractor KBR about conditions at one base in 2005. The letter warned of ""extreme dangers"" of electrical shock and fire hazards at the facility. Rogers, who left Afghanistan shortly after writing that letter, told CNN that the work done by KBR at one U.S. base in Kabul was ""by far"" the worst he has seen in 20-plus years in the trade. ""As a complete whole, the electrical work at the camp was very dangerous,"" he said. ""And I don't think it would be an exaggeration to say that I don't believe any of it was done safely."" Jeff Bliss says he saw similar electrical hazards when he worked as an electrician in Afghanistan. Bliss, also a former KBR electrician, told a Senate Democratic Policy Committee meeting in 2008 that ""the carelessness and disregard for quality work at KBR was pervasive."" In one case, Bliss said, a soldier at a field command post received a 400-volt shock from wiring that other soldiers told him had been installed by a plumber and a security guard. The 20-year veteran of the trade said KBR hired many unqualified or unlicensed electricians, and relied heavily on non-American workers who were unfamiliar with U.S. standards and spoke little or no English. ""I saw firsthand how KBR's carelessness unnecessarily put people's lives in danger,"" he testified. Bliss, Rogers and three other experienced electricians who worked for KBR in 2005 and 2006 told CNN that their warnings to supervisors were ignored. The electricians showed CNN photographs they say show dangerous wiring, and overloaded or badly wired circuit panels that have caused fires at U.S. installations. And several U.S. soldiers who were stationed in Afghanistan said they received electrical shocks themselves or knew soldiers who suffered them. The soldiers said they preferred to not be identified because of possible retribution from the Army. KBR would not comment on specific criticism about the company's work in Afghanistan, but it has consistently denied any improper electrical work or responsibility for deaths or injuries. ""The electrical standards in Iraq are nowhere near those of Western standards,"" it told CNN in a written statement. ""So we are adapting to an environment that existed long before KBR got on the ground in Iraq and Afghanistan."" In Iraq, at least 18 U.S. troops are known to have died by electrocution -- many while on U.S. bases being managed by various military contractors, including KBR. The Pentagon would not say whether there were any fatalities or serious injuries from electrocutions in Afghanistan, telling CNN it would not comment on an ongoing investigation by the Defense Department's inspector general. But the Pentagon said it considers electrical dangers to be ""a very serious issue,"" and has launched widespread inspections in Afghanistan and Iraq to fix any electrical hazards and ensure that future installations comply with U.S. electrical code. Sen. Byron Dorgan of North Dakota, who leads the Democratic Policy Committee, said the accounts from Afghanistan show ""some of the same problems exist in both war theaters."" ""I don't think the problem has been fixed,"" Dorgan said. ""I don't think at this point the Pentagon has bitten the bullet to say, 'We're going to fix these problems in a very significant way, and we're going to cause contractors to be accountable for their work.' I think, as a result of it not being fixed, I think there are risks."" Dorgan said he was ""outraged"" at the Defense Department for not moving faster to fix electrical hazards. ""Our soldiers shouldn't be taking risks by taking showers,"" he said. ""They ought to be able to expect that the electrical work at their military base is not going to result in their death or injury because of shoddy workmanship."" KBR has already come under fire for its work in Iraq. The Army's lead investigator into the death of Staff Sgt. Ryan Maseth, of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, recently wrote that she would recommend Maseth's cause of death be changed to ""negligent homicide."" Her report accused KBR of failing to properly supervise or inspect its work, but the Army has yet to make a final ruling on the case. Maseth was found dead in the shower in his Baghdad quarters in January 2008. Two of the soldiers who told CNN that they suffered shocks in Afghanistan said they were in showers at the time as well. Army inspectors recently found KBR failed to do proper electrical wiring on bases in Iraq. Their report found that incidents of electric shock were happening an average of every three days for nearly two years, and that the company was in serious violation of its contract.","Electrician called power systems at Afghan base ""a disaster waiting to happen""

"(CNN) -- More than 600 members of a fringe Christian group in China have been detained for spreading rumors of an impending apocalypse, pegged to the Mayan calendar, China's Xinhua news agency reported. Known as the Almighty God cult, the group latched on to the Mayan doomsday scenario to predict the sun would not shine and electricity would not work for three days beginning on December 21. The cult was established in 1990 in central China and requires its members to surrender their property to the group. Group members have spread doomsday rumors door-to-door or at public venues and claimed only they could save people's lives, according to authorities.

"(CNN) -- Ghana, the four time champion of the African Cup of Nations, took a giant step towards qualifying for the quarterfinals following a 1-0 win over Mali in South Africa Thursday. Mubarak Wakaso's 38th minute penalty was enough to separate the two teams in a game which the Black Stars dominated. But the contest could have turned out in a very diferent fashion had Ghana goalkeeper Fatau Dauda been sent off for deliberately handling the ball outside of his penalty area. Mourinho mentors Cape Verde's 'Special One' The incident occurred with just eight minutes played in Port Elizabeth when Dauda clearly used his hands to field the ball and deny Mali a clear effort on goal. The referee remarkably only produced a yellow card, a decision which was later criticized by Mali coach Patrice Carteron. He told reporters: ""The referee did not help us because he ought to have sent off the Ghana goalkeeper rather than just booking him for handling the ball outside his area. ""Ghana was better, especially in the first half, but we still have a game to qualify for the next round and so we will forget this match and focus on our next game."" After the early let-off, Ghana began to assert itself and came close to taking the lead when Emmanuel Agyeman Badu crashed a header against the post. Africa Cup of Nations 2013: The teams . But Ghana didn't have to wait long for the breakthrough as Wakaso stroked home from the spot following Adam Tamboura's foul on Agyeman Badu. Mali tried to force an equalizer after the break and Seydou Keita came close to connecting with Mahamane Traore's pass, but Ghana held out for the points. ""We were much more tactically disciplined in this game than against DR Congo, but I know we can do a lot better than we did today,"" Ghana coach Kwesi Appiah told reporters. Captain Asamoah Gyan added: ""It was a difficult game. We needed to win and now we have four points, but we need more to qualify to the next stage and so we will not underrate Niger."" The result leaves Ghana at the top of Group B on four points from its two games, one point clear of Mali going into the final round of games. In the day's other game, Niger held on for its first ever point at the Africa Cup of Nations after holding Democratic Republic of Congo to a goalless draw. ""With such great players from Niger, you can only be proud of them,"" Niger coach Gernot Rohr told reporters. ""I'm very happy we have made some kind of history by collecting our first Cup of Nations point. We have made some progress in this competition after losing all three matches in Gabon last year.""

"Tripoli, Libya (CNN)  -- Libya will hold elections in the coming months as the war-torn country works toward building a new society in the post-Moammar Gadhafi era, interim government officials announced Saturday. Mahmoud Jibril, chairman of the National Transitional Council executive board, said elections ""should be within a period of eight months, maximum."" He spoke at the World Economic Forum in Jordan. The first vote will be for a National Congress that will draft a constitution. After that, parliamentary and presidential elections will be held. Gadhafi's death Thursday solidified the power of the NTC, which will mark the country's liberation on Sunday in the eastern city of Benghazi, where the uprising started. NATO, which launched an operation to protect Libyan citizens against the Gadhafi regime during the Libyan war, plans to ends its operations by October 31. Speaking in his weekly address Saturday, Obama said Gadhafi's death ""showed that our role in protecting the Libyan people, and helping them break free from a tyrant, was the right thing to do."" ""Our brave pilots and crews helped prevent a massacre, save countless lives, and give the Libyan people the chance to prevail. Without putting a single U.S. service member on the ground, we achieved our objectives. Soon, our NATO mission will come to a successful end even as we continue to support the Libyan people, and people across the Arab world, who seek a democratic future."" Questions persist about what would happen to Gadhafi's body. His family issued a statement Friday calling on the United Nations and Amnesty International to push Libya's new leadership ""to hand over the bodies of the martyrs of their tribe so they can be buried according to Islamic rites,"" a pro-Gadhafi TV station reported. Gadhafi's body was on public display Saturday at a Misrata meat market cooler. Queues of people lined up to view the corpse, which appeared to have a bullet hole on the left temple. Libyan and world powers wanted to capture Gadhafi and prosecute him for war crimes. The U.N. human rights office and activist groups like Amnesty and Human Rights Watch have called for probe into his death amid questions over the final moments of the late Libyan strongman's life. They want to know whether Gadhafi was killed in crossfire or executed by fighters. ""There are at least two cell-phone videos, one showing him alive and one showing him dead. Taken together, these videos are very disturbing,"" human rights office spokesman Rupert Colville told reporters in Geneva on Friday. ""We believe there is a need for an investigation and more details are needed to ascertain whether he was killed in the fighting or after his capture."" Human Rights Watch, which is also calling for an internationally supervised autopsy and an investigation into the death, said it is unlikely that Gadhafi was killed in crossfire. Peter Bouckaert, the group's emergencies director, told CNN that fighting had ended when Gadhafi was cornered in a drainage ditch. He said crowds beat Gadhafi in what was a ""humiliating end"" for the former dictator. ""When he left the area, he was very much alive,"" Bouckaert said. ""There's no reason why he should have been subjected to this kind of mob justice."" CNN's Dan Rivers and Victoria Brown contributed to this report.","Moammar Gadhafi's body is on display .

"(CNN) -- Even before they had a chance to view it, everyone involved with Showtime's megahit, ""Homeland,"" ""knew that it was something extraordinary and special,"" said actor Mandy Patinkin. The veteran star spoke to CNN at the premiere party for season two, ahead of the show's premiere on Sunday. In ""Homeland,"" CIA intelligence officer Carrie Mathison (Claire Danes) believes that Marine Sgt. Nicholas Brody (Damian Lewis), a POW returning from Iraq, became a traitor while in captivity and is planning to fulfill a terror plot on U.S. soil. At the end of season one, Brody decides to run for Congress. Meanwhile Carrie, who suffers from bipolar disorder, realizes why Brody would turn on his country just as she's about to undergo electroconvulsive therapy that will erase her short-term memory. Season one received nine Emmy nominations, and picked up four of them at the 64th Primetime Emmy Awards, including outstanding drama series. 'Homeland,' 'Modern Family' win big at Emmys . If you've been wanting to get into ""Homeland"" or catch up before the new season premiere, there's still time. Season one was recently released on DVD/Blu-ray. In addition, Showtime will air a marathon of all 12 episodes of the first season on Saturday, September 29, beginning at noon ET/PT. Season two premieres Sunday, September 30, at 10 p.m. ET/PT. To kick things off for Sunday's return, Showtime and Time Warner Cable hosted a screening and reception at the Intrepid Sea, Air and Space Museum in New York. Among the attendees, who were greeted by an enormous Brody 2012 fictional campaign poster, were the entire ""Homeland"" cast, including outstanding actress and actor in a drama series Emmy winners Danes and Lewis. 'Homeland' grabs Emmys for lead actors in a drama . Also in attendance were Vogue Editor-in-Chief Anna Wintour and designer Valentino. Cocktails were followed by a screening of the first episode of season two and an after-party on the USS Intrepid flight deck complete with fireworks, tiny cupcakes in the ""Homeland"" logo and empanadas and pulled pork sliders served up directly under the Space Shuttle Enterprise. Patinkin shared with CNN how he prepared for the role of Saul Berenson, CIA Middle East Division chief and mentor to Carrie. He traveled to Langley, Virginia, and met with a man who had been a CIA chief. ""I was asking a lot of emotional questions,"" the actor said, ""because I was interested in his emotional reaction to certain situations, fears -- human nature questions."" At one point, Patinkin continued, the former CIA chief mentioned that he had two daughters, ""and the daughters came over and then we were there for hours talking as a family, and that's when the nickel dropped for me. Before we shot a single frame, I realized it was a show about family. It was a show about Saul's relationship with his 'daughter' Carrie, the Brody family, the family of the CIA and the family of the world at large. And so that moment when those daughters came to that table -- I was home free."" Actor David Harewood plays David Estes, Carrie's boss at the CIA. He recalled meeting a CIA agent in preparation for his role as director of the CIA Counterterrorism Center. ""I happened to meet with a CIA operative who was a very scary lady,"" he said, ""a very beautiful lady, but a very scary lady. I had dinner with her and she kind of looked straight through me. I felt like she was looking into my soul."" Harewood said he believes there has been such a massive positive response to ""Homeland"" from audiences because it is ""one of the few shows which really seeks to not only entertain but also tell the truth. It really hit a raw nerve with people. People really want to know what goes on behind the doors of the CIA in terms of terrorists and terrorism, and 'Homeland' kind of seems to answer some of those questions."" Actress Amy Hargreaves plays Carrie's sister and caretaker Maggie. ""As season two opens,"" said Hargreaves, ""it's six months later, so Carrie's had time to kind of go through some treatments and that's where we jump off. She's in good hands and we're kind of helping her regroup."" ""What's nice about the way Showtime treats 'Homeland,'"" Hargreaves continued, ""is they give us time before we shoot every scene. We sit down, we talk about it, we figure out what feels right, what doesn't feel right. Working with Mandy is especially excellent ... we spent a lot of time on-set making sure that things were appropriate and accurate before we shot. It's been such a thrill to go to work and to get to work with Claire and Mandy. They blow me away."" Actress Morena Baccarin said ""season two tops season one, if that is possible."" 'Homeland' actress' hair: The long and short of it . Of her character, Brody's wife Jessica, Baccarin said that she loves that ""she's a no-frills kind of woman. She held her family together. She must have a sense of humor and strength somewhere deep inside that we don't get to see very often. The strength you get to see, absolutely, but she's vulnerable and going through a lot all the time, so you don't get to see her laughing very much. But this is a woman who held it together for eight years alone, so I think she's not a victim and she's not afraid; and when she is afraid she holds it together for her kids."" As for actor Diego Klattenhoff, who plays Mike -- Brody's Marine buddy and the man who became Jessica's love interest after she believed him dead -- he said that in season two, ""I'm always there as his friend, kind of like a safety net. I'm always going to be there for the family. I think that inevitably I get pulled into certain situations."" Actress Morgan Saylor, who plays 16-year-old Dana Brody, said, ""I love getting to be a hooligan and getting to be rebellious and openly so disdainful of my mother. That's really fun."" As for the upcoming season, of which eight out of 12 episodes have been filmed so far, Saylor said there are ""definitely some changes this year between Dana and her father. She kind of sees his faults a little more."" We also spoke with musician Sean Callery, who wrote the ""Homeland"" theme song and writes the background score. He received his 12th Emmy nomination this year for ""Outstanding Original Main Title Theme Music"" for ""Homeland."" Callery was thrilled to be able to implement Carrie's love of jazz into the storyline in creative yet subtle ways. ""She's a spontaneous, improvisational character,"" said Callery, ""impulsive. Not many shows have jazz, so it was nice to have something new."" ""Homeland"" is not a particularly heavily scored show. Callery said that if the audience notices the music too much, ""then I'm getting in the way."" But when it does contain music, Callery explained, ""it's extremely transparent and very much in your face."" For example, the pilot episode contains a scene that Callery wrote the music for, where a live jazz band is playing at a bar while news footage of Brody's return plays on TV screens. Carrie studies the musicians' finger movements on their instruments and concludes that Brody is tapping his fingers in some kind of code. Callery, who won three Emmys for his work on Fox's ""24,"" noted that ""Homeland"" die-hards will notice that the theme song has been varied ever so slightly for season two. ""It does evolve,"" he said. ""It changes; it gets a little darker at times. I'm dying to speak of it but it hasn't aired yet."" Alex Gansa, series co-creator and executive producer, recalled finding out that ""Homeland"" was President Obama's favorite show. ""We didn't feel that we had to do anything different,"" Gansa said, ""but it gives us extra impetus every day in the story room to try to make this thing good the second season, to try to live up to the promise of the first season."" Gansa said that the cast and crew remain stunned by the positive audience response to the program because ""these wars that we're fighting overseas are so removed from the general citizenry and their consciousness that we were curious whether anybody would even be interested in watching, but one thing that we felt was missing from television was this idea of the returning soldier and so we really wanted to dramatize how difficult that return can be sometimes. And obviously there are some serious extenuating circumstances in Brody's case but if you watch the first series of episodes you could interpret Brody's behavior as either somebody who's hiding his terrorist motivations or somebody who's just having trouble re-integrating back into his life.""","Actress Morena Baccarin: ""Season two tops season one, if that is possible""

"(CNN) -- Deaf actress Marlee Matlin has captivated millions with her  film roles over the years. And she's now giving a new voice to an important issue. Actress Marlee Matlin appears on CNN's ""Larry King Live"" on Monday night to talk about her sexual abuse. Monday night on ""Larry King Live,"" the Academy Award winner opened up to guest host Joy Behar about the sexual abuse she suffered as a child. She says the abuse led to drug use. She also opened up about her volatile relationship with actor William Hurt. This interview has been edited for brevity and clarity: . Guest host Joy Behar: [Your] book is called ""I'll Scream Later."" Marlee, what does it mean, ""I'll Scream Later?"" Marlee Matlin (through her interpreter, Jack): It goes way back to when I was in rehab. ... I got nominated for the Academy Awards while I was in rehab. And Jack asked me over the phone: ""What do you want to say?"" The press wants an answer. ... The counselors were looking at me. I couldn't say anything. So I said, ""I'll scream later."" ...  Watch Matalin talk about her new book with CNN.com Â» . Behar: This book tells a lot. Matlin: It tells a lot more than I anticipated I would. ... After I did ""Dancing With the Stars,"" so many e-mails came, so many fan letters came saying how inspiring I was. And they saw me on TV dancing and they thought: Well, a deaf person can dance. Good for you. Wow! She can't hear the music. She can dance. Wow! And that's fine. But I wanted to pass along the message that there was much more to me than that. Behar: You were [molested] at age 11 by a 16-year-old female baby sitter? Matlin: Unfortunately, yes. Behar: How did that impact your life? Matlin: I masked it, and I covered it up. And I masked it with drugs. And I masked it at a very early age with drugs. ... I never told anyone. I never told my parents. And yet, I never forgot it. Behar: Who was the first person you did tell? Matlin: That's a good question. It was probably my husband. Behar: Your husband that you have now, your present husband? Matlin: Yes. (Laughter). I only have one husband. Behar: You've only been married once. And you're married a long time, too, right? ... And he's a policeman? Matlin: He's a policeman, and he's hot. ... Behar: OK. Now the other thing is you were then molested again, in high school, when you were 14, by a teacher. Matlin: It was a teacher who I looked up to and became friendly with. At the time ... I wanted good grades, you know, and I wanted his approval. Behar: He sort of lured you into his apartment? Matlin: Yes. Behar: But then you continued to see him? Matlin: I did continue. And when I found out 10 years later, after graduating from high school, that other women in school had the same experience. Behar: Did you think it was molestation or did you think you were having a relationship with a teacher? Matlin: I knew it was wrong. The reason why [was] because he was married. ... And I didn't think it was illegal. I mean that didn't even pop in my mind. I was never told what was right and what was wrong about the situation. And at the time, I'm thinking it's wrong because he's married. Behar: Because you were a deaf young girl, do you think that played into all of the molestations? Matlin: It could be. It's possible. Behar: Did they see you as easy prey? Matlin: The baby sitter wasn't deaf, so it was possible. ... But it's all about taking advantage of a child, whether they're deaf or hearing. Behar: I understand that. I'm just wondering if it happens even more often to a handicapped child. Matlin: I don't know. Behar: All right, let's talk about William Hurt. What's the deal between the two of you? Was it love? Was it lust? Matlin: You know what, actually, we started our relationship during the end of the screen test process for ""Children of a Lesser God"" before I even got the role. And it continued until I got the role. And it continued throughout the film. And it continued after. And I lived with him with for two years. Behar: And you said in the book that the sex with him was spectacular. Now you've piqued my interest. Can we have a few details here? Matlin: You know, actually, we were in love. We were truly in love in a relationship, but part of that was love-hate. I mean I was battling my drug addiction at the time. Behar: What kind of drugs were you using? Matlin: Pot, cocaine, and -- . Behar: Alcohol, too? Matlin: No alcohol. Alcohol was never my thing. Behar: He was doing drugs, too? Matlin: With me, yes. Behar: Tell me about the abusive part of the relationship with him. Was he physically abusive or verbally? Matlin: It is not easy to talk about it. Behar: I know. Matlin: But it happened. ... I was 19, and he was 35. I didn't understand what this was about. ... There was so much going on with the film, with him being older, me being younger, not seeing eye to eye on a lot of things, and being drunk and being high ... Behar: Was there violence? Matlin: There was violence. Behar: Sometimes? Matlin: All the time. Behar: He's a big fellow. He might have hurt you. You are a small girl. Matlin: But I kick butt. Behar: You kicked him back? Matlin: Oh, yes.  I had to. I had to. Behar: But you stayed. Why did you say? Matlin: I didn't know how to leave. I didn't have friends in New York. I didn't know that you could ask for help. I didn't know that you could call 911. I didn't know. Now I know. And for anyone who's in this kind of relationship, look, it's hard. It's hard to get out when you don't know. Behar: Has he ever apologized to you? Matlin: No. Behar: You're very nice to him in the book. You have an acknowledgment in the book for William Hurt. Matlin: Look, he is a very good actor. I have nothing but the utmost respect for the work we had together. I was a fan of his before I met him. Behar: But if he hasn't apologized and you still  feel that he was very wrong in the way he behaved, why do you acknowledge ... ? Matlin: If he apologized, I would forgive him, but I won't forget. Behar: You won't forget, no. But you've forgiven him in this book. it seems to me. Matlin: How else am I going to live? How else am I going to live? You have to try to find the heart to forgive. Behar: You are a strong, very talented actress. You are a role model for a lot of young people. ... In this book, are you afraid this is going to change the way people see you? Matlin: No. ...

"(CNN) -- Arnold Schwarzenegger knows a thing or two about being an all-action hero -- but it was Austria's Marcel Hirscher who terminated his rivals' hopes at Kitzbuhel. In front of the Terminator star, the current World Cup leader produced an astonishing second run at Sunday's World Cup slalom to clinch victory after finishing third in the opening leg. The home favorite raced home in 53.51 seconds, giving him a winning total of 1min 44.34 seconds to see off Germany's Felix Neureuther and Croatia's Ivica Kostelic. Austrian ace conquered skiing's most feared slope . ""I tried my best. It was pretty difficult,"" Hirscher told reporters. ""I knew that if I wanted to win, I definitely had to beat Felix."" Over 30,000 fans including Schwarznegger had packed into the stands with the Austrian-born former California governor enjoying Hirscher's victory. It was Hirscher's fourth slalom triumph of the season and kept him top of the World Cup standings on 1,035 points, 114 points ahead of Norway's Aksel Lund Svindal on 921. Croatia's Kostelic, who took third, is now guaranteed a record fourth successive victory in the men's World Cup combined event, which takes into account the total of the downhill and slalom times. Kostelic, the overall World Cup winner in 2001, underwent an operation on his troublesome right knee in February 2012 and has been forced to miss large parts of his training. Hirscher stars in Zagreb . But the 33-year-old produced an impressive second run Sunday to win the combined event, which will be replaced next season by a super-combined, comprising a shortened downhill and one slalom run . ""The course was a little bit different. We had three very significant rolls, man-made I think with snow, and it was also very icy,"" Kostelic told reporters, before adding that he thought it was a ""big mistake"" to scrap the classic combined event. ""My stance is that in a year or two I'll be gone from skiing and those who oppose it also. ""The classical combined is already an old man, introduced in 1931, and to destroy this is unbelievable to me. ""You cannot build tradition. It's the oldest discipline. ""You gain nothing from one more hybrid race (the super-combined), but you lose a lot more if the classic combined in Kitzbuhel is destroyed."" Victorious Vonn closes on World Cup record . Meanwhile, in the women's section, Slovenia's Tina Maze won her seventh World Cup race of the season in front of her home fans in Maribor. The 29-year-old recorded hier 18th career World Cup victory after coming home in timed 1min 33.68sec over the two legs, 00.86secs quicker than Frida Hansdotter of Sweden while Austrian Kathrin Zettel was third, 1.13sec adrift. Maze, who finished second behind U.S. star Lindsey Vonn in Saturday's giant slalom, has picked up 17 podium finishes in 25 races. ""It was wonderful to cross the line in front of my compatriots,"" Maze told reporters. ""I wanted to deliver their victory for Slovenia, but Schladming (the world championships), will host the most important races of the season."" Maze now looks set to win the overall competition with the magic number of 2000 points within her grasp after moving on to 1664 for the season. Only Austrian legend Hermann Maier has ever broken through the 2000 point barrier in the history of World Cup skiing.","Austria's Marcel Hirscher won Sunday's World Cup slalom at Kitzbuhel .

"(CNN) -- The political turmoil dividing Egypt threatens the nation's future, the defense minister said, as the instability persists in the Arab world's most populous country. ""The ongoing conflict among the various political forces ... may lead to the collapse of the state and threaten the future of our coming generations,"" Defense Minister Gen. Abdul Fattah al-Sisi said Tuesday. Anti-government protesters ignored President Mohamed Morsy's curfew order in cities along the Suez Canal and clashed with police and troops, state-run media reported Tuesday. In Port Said, about 4,000 people joined the protest, which began at Mariam mosque and continued for hours, winding its way through the streets. They chanted anti-government slogans, at times laced with profanities. The authorities didn't appear to be detaining any of the demonstrators. On Tuesday night, the Muslim Brotherhood announced on its Facebook and Twitter pages that the president has delegated authority to either limit or cancel the curfew to governors of Port Said, Ismailia and Suez. CNN iReport: Inhaling tear gas, breaking the curfew . The protests are the latest in the seesaw struggle between Egypt's first democratically elected president and dissidents who say his tenure is a throwback to past dictatorships, particularly the reign of President Hosni Mubarak, toppled in a popular revolt two years ago. The most recent furor stems from Morsy's declaration of a limited state of emergency for violent hot spots. On Sunday, he announced a 30-day nighttime curfew for the provinces of Port Said, Suez and Ismailia. Those areas have seen a spate of bloodshed in recent days, starting with the second anniversary of the Egyptian revolution on Friday. Dissidents angry about the slow pace of change fought with Morsy supporters and police. At least seven people were killed in those clashes. The tumult intensified a day later, when a judge issued death sentences for 21 Port Said residents for their roles in a deadly football riot last year. Port Said, which has had a difficult relationship with Cairo over the past six decades, erupted in chaos. At least 38 people were killed in the two days following the verdicts. Egypt's defense minister has denied reports that the army used live ammunition on protesters, state-run media reported. Interior Minister Mohamed Ibrahim told police forces Sunday that he understands the challenges and demands they've faced, saying ""together with your brothers at the armed forces, you constitute the country's shield and fort in face of all dangers."" ""You've faced unprecedented and systematic patterns of violence,"" he said. ""Your security during these confrontations is my goal."" Ibrahim huddled with Prime Minister Hisham Qandil on Monday over state of emergency arrangements, including maintaining peaceful expression, but also dealing firmly with saboteurs targeting police. The Transport Ministry said that despite the tumult in the Suez Canal region, the unrest has not affected shipping operations to or from the eastern and western ports of Port Said or the traffic at the El Arish port. What's behind the latest wave of violence in Egypt? Black Bloc labeled terrorist group . Egyptian Prosecutor General Talaat Abdullah has listed one anti-government group, the Black Bloc, as a terrorist entity. Authorities say its members are often seen wearing black ski masks, waving their trademark black flag while taking part in some of the most violent attacks against police and security forces. The designation raises the specter of the government taking a more aggressive stance against anti-government protesters. The group says its mission is to fight government corruption and oppression. The government has often used the Black Bloc's aggressive tactics to depict anti-government protesters as part of an insurgency that wants to topple Egypt's leadership. Morsy calls for talks . In a speech Sunday night, Morsy decried the behavior of ""criminals,"" saying recent violence ""does not have anything to do with the Egyptian revolution. ... In fact, it is against the revolution."" But he acknowledged the legitimate dissent in Egypt, saying ""dialogue is the only way to bring about stability and security."" To this end, he invited representatives from 11 political parties to a meeting. But a key opposition leader issued conditions before accepting Morsy's call for talks. ""Without accepting his responsibility as a president for the latest bloody events, promising to form a government of national salvation and commissioning a balanced committee to amend the constitution, any dialogue will be a waste of time,"" said Mohamed ElBaradei, head of the Constitution Party and a member of the opposition National Salvation Front. Protests could drag on . The National Salvation Front held the president responsible ""for the excessive violence used by security forces against protesters"" and called for peaceful demonstrations, according to a statement posted on the state-run Al-Ahram news website. The group made several demands before it would urge people to stop protesting, including the formation of a new government and making changes to what it called the ""distorted constitution"" that voters passed in a referendum last month. Morsy's supporters warned the opposition against such demands. ""We would like for the political forces, especially the National Salvation Front, to realize how important this defining moment is and to put the interest of the nation above all,"" said Gamal Tag, senior leader of the Freedom and Justice Party, the political wing of the Muslim Brotherhood. ""They need to know that President Morsy's call for dialogue is not out of weakness, but it is out of his responsibility as president. ... Some forces are still putting conditions and obstacles before this national dialogue in order to make it fail. These people do not put forward the national interest. They are looking for personal gains."" U.N. human rights official weighs in . The scores of deaths prompted Navi Pillay, the U.N. high commissioner for human rights, to denounce the violence and call for dialogue among all parties. ""While at least two policemen are among those killed, preliminary unconfirmed reports suggest that most of the casualties have been caused by live fire and excessive use of tear gas by the authorities,"" a statement from Pillay's office said. In addition, as many as 25 female protesters reportedly have been sexually assaulted in Cairo's Tahrir Square over the past few days, ""in some cases with extraordinary violence,"" the statement said. She said the state of emergency should be governed by the rule of law, in line with international standards. She urged Morsy to listen to the demands of demonstrators and take action to deal with problems in the judicial system. She said that all ""stakeholders"" should be involved in reviewing legislation on demonstrations, associations and access to public information. ""I urge the government to take urgent measures to ensure that law enforcement personnel never again use disproportionate or excessive force against protesters, firstly because it is illegal to do so, and secondly because it is likely to make the situation even more explosive,"" Pillay said. CNN's Reza Sayed in Port Said and Amir Ahmed, Salma Abdelaziz and Joe Sterling contributed to this report.","NEW: President says on social media that curfews are in hands of local governments .

"(Health.com) -- Waste happens. Every cook knows that. Still, discovering wilted herbs or a loaf of stale bread can make you feel careless. Plus, tossing out food is expensive! The average American household discards between $500 and $2,000 worth of food a year. But there are clever ways to minimize waste, by storing food carefully or preserving it at its peak to enjoy later, says Sherri Brooks Vinton, author of ""Put 'Em Up,"" a book about preserving food. Here, a few of our favorites. Bread . The problem: You bought more loaves than you need. Use it now: Cooks the world over have come up with smart ways to use old bread. A super-quick one: croutons. Cut bread into cubes, toss with a little olive oil and salt, and toast in a 275-degree oven for about 20 minutes, shaking the pan halfway through, until golden. Cool, then store in an airtight container for up to two weeks. They're delicious in soups and salads, or crushed and sprinkled over pasta. Save it for later: While it's still fresh, place a sliced loaf right in the freezer. Then, pull out slices as you need them and pop them in the toaster. ""People don't think of the freezer as a preserving mechanism, but it is,"" Vinton says. Health.com: Essential items for a healthy pantry . Fresh fruit . The problem: Buying fruit in season is wise. ""The vitamin content of seasonal produce is at its peak,"" says Christina Munsell, research associate at the Yale Rudd Center for Food Policy and Obesity. But we often buy more than we can eat. Use it now: You don't need a recipe to make fruit salad -- most kinds go together naturally. Just cut up what you have (skip bananas, which go mushy; see the tip below). Add one-quarter teaspoon of vanilla, a generous squeeze of citrus (to slow browning), and a drizzle of honey. Set the bowl front and center in your fridge; it'll be the first thing everyone sees when they go snack-hunting. 40% of U.S. food wasted, report says . Save it for later: Most soft fruit (berries, kiwi, peaches) freeze well in lightly sweetened syrup. Toss with sugar (1 teaspoon per cup of fruit) and let it stand until it releases its juices; transfer to a freezer-safe plastic bag, squeeze out the air, and freeze for up to nine months. Firmer fruit like apples and pears can be simmered in a covered pot, with a squeeze of lemon juice, a splash of water, and a couple of tablespoons of sugar, until barely limp; when cool, transfer to a container, and freeze. What about bananas? Peel ripe bananas, break into chunks, and place in a freezer-safe bag. You won't like them thawed -- too mushy -- but you can add frozen pieces to smoothies (they won't make them watery, as ice does). Health.com: Healthy milk shake and smoothie recipes . Seasonal vegetables . The problem: They have a habit of hiding out in dark corners of the fridge until they're beyond revival. Use it now: As with fruit, the flavors of most vegetables marry well. Cut whatever you have into bite-size pieces, sautÃÂ© a diced onion in a soup pot, and add the veggies (starting with the firmest, since they take longest to cook). Cover with vegetable broth and simmer until tender. PurÃÂ©e or eat chunky. Save it for later: Make your own frozen veggies. Prepare them as you'd cook them, except stop when they're halfway done. You can steam or boil green beans, corn, broccoli, and chard, then quickly rinse in cold water to stop the cooking, and drain and pack in freezer-safe bags. Or pickle your veggies. Health.com: 11 things it's best to buy organic . Herbs . The problem: Your holiday dish calls for a pinch of dill. That leaves you with nine sprigs that are fading fast. Use it now: Fresh herbs are flavor powerhouses, so it can be tricky to improvise without a recipe. A few combos that work deliciously: Try thyme, rosemary, and bay leaf with chicken; add rosemary, parsley, and sage to pork. Toss mint, dill, and cilantro in your salads or green veggie dishes. Save it for later: To preserve tender herbs (dill, cilantro, parsley), make a sauce or paste (think pesto) with olive or vegetable oil. PurÃÂ©e the cleaned leaves in a food processor with the oil and a little salt. Cilantro oil, for example, can later be mixed with coconut milk, chilies, lime, and soy sauce to make a Thai sauce for fish or chicken. Herb pastes keep up to one week in the refrigerator (drizzle oil over the top to prevent browning) and up to six months in the freezer. Health.com: The healthiest alternatives to olive oil . Hardy herbs, like rosemary and sage, meanwhile, are easy to dry. Clean a bunch, grasp the stems, tie with string, then suspend, leaves down, in a dry room. When herbs crumble, transfer to a jar and store in a cool, dry place. Or submerge herbs in a bottle of white-wine vinegar. The flavor will spruce up your salads for months.

"(CNN) -- An Australian radio show whose prank targeting Prince William's pregnant wife went horribly wrong has been taken off the air for good. ""The Hot30 Countdown"" was suspended temporarily after the December prank, when the network expressed deep regret for the nurse who apparently committed suicide after routing through a call from the show's DJs to the royal ward. Over the weekend, the show was permanently taken off the air. The show's Facebook page directed listeners to the show's replacement called ""The Bump."" Opinion: DJs broke 'Do No Harm' rule . In response to a user comment, the Facebook page said the two DJ's, Mel Greig and Michael Christian, ""continue to have our full support and we look forward to them returning to work when the time is right!"" In early December, the two DJs impersonated Queen Elizabeth and Prince Charles and called King Edward VII's Hospital to gain some information about the condition of Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge. The pair subsequently played the prank on air. The nurse who transferred the call through to the ward, Jacintha Saldanha, was later found dead after apparently committing suicide. An uproar followed. Who was nurse Jacintha Saldhana? Prank prompts backlash . The two DJs were taken off the air. And the network, Southern Cross Austereo, suspended all prank calls, pulled advertising and ordered a comprehensive review of relevant policies and process. Greig and Christian apologized in interviews with the Australian TV shows ""A Current Affair"" and ""Today Tonight."" ""There is nothing that can make me feel worse than what I feel right now,"" Greig said on ""Today Tonight."" Aussie DJ scandal: Does radio share the blame? Christian told ""A Current Affair"" the prank had become ""a tragic turn of events that I don't think anyone could have predicted or expected."" The chairman of the hospital where the pregnant Duchess of Cambridge was a patient slammed the Australian radio station's decision to broadcast the recorded prank call as ""truly appalling."" ""The immediate consequence of these premeditated and ill-considered actions was the humiliation of two dedicated and caring nurses who were simply doing their job tending to their patients,"" wrote the chairman, Simon Glenarthur. ""The longer term consequence has been reported around the world and is, frankly, tragic beyond words."" Nurse's family: 'We love you and will miss you forever' 'World's worst accents ever' Audio of the call posted online suggests a woman spoke briefly to the DJs before she put the call through to the ward where the Duchess of Cambridge was being treated for acute morning sickness. ""They were the world's worst accents ever,"" Greig told listeners then. ""We were sure 100 people at least before us would've tried the same thing. ... We were expecting to be hung up on. We didn't even know what to say when we got through."" Off the air, Greig and Christian tweeted about the practical joke, promising ""more on the #royalprank."" The pair's Twitter accounts were later taken down. A St. James's Palace spokesman said the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge were saddened to learn of Saldanha's death. Another palace spokesman told CNN that ""at no point did the palace complain to the hospital about the incident. On the contrary, we offered our full and heartfelt support to the nurses involved and hospital staff at all times.""

"Dubai, United Arab Emirates (CNN) -- If you look at Dubai, there is the modern side and the traditional side, but they all interact with each other. If I'm in the car, I can go from one place to another and see different backgrounds, different people and different surrounding -- and for me this is always interesting to show in my work. I have seen it growing -- more buildings, hotels and lots of architecture being constructed all the time. It has changed rapidly over the past 10 years. I think I am lucky to see it all happen because now if there is an extra building, I would not really notice it! I have seen it all change. It is part of who I am. There is always that other side of Dubai where it is very simple, humble and down-to-earth, regardless of who you are. I think it is always important to see the original Dubai, how it used to be, and a lot of it is still there. I don't mind having these modern architectural buildings. It was more of a desert over here with tents and small houses, so there wasn't really much to preserve. Our job was to build more and I think Dubai has that balance where there are the old and the new areas. I'm very interested in artisans of the region because few of them exist. I always like to work one-to-one with craftsmen and recreate what they are making. I try and look for traditional materials. I would take a traditional material and maybe wrap it around a Formula One car ... or fit it on an art platform in a new way. I would call myself a multidisciplinary designer -- I use more than one medium at the same time. More from Human to Hero: How 'Slam Dunk' Manga artist brings characters to life . Sometimes an old Emirati man will come and whisper in my ear: ""Isn't this a gargour (traditional fishing trap made of steel)?"" And I would say, ""Yeah."" For me this is what I am trying to do -- show my work to people who maybe are not from an art background. Art Dubai is an art fair that happens every year in March. I was an artist-in-residence in 2012. The residency program is located in Old Dubai. There are a couple of old buildings that are turned into art spaces. I wanted to do something connected to the area, so just a couple of blocks away, if you walked through Bastakiya (one of the oldest most traditional districts of Dubai) you would see the fabric shops and I remembered the textile shops from my childhood. My mum would get fabrics and I think this was where my interest in art and colors started. There is usually a cardboard tube that they wrap around the fabric and ... so I said, ""Can I use them?"" I ended up collecting about 50 a day from different shops. I created stools and chairs that you could arrange in different ways as modular furniture. More from Human to Hero: Ghanian artist who transforms bottle tops into masterpieces . I was also very interested in the wooden hand barrows that are used to take these fabrics from one shop to another. Most of the hand barrow men -- known as haath gadi wallahs -- can only speak Urdu. I convinced one of them to work with me like a performance and I took him into Bastakiya which has very narrow streets. But right now instead of having fabrics on that barrow, it has got an art piece on it made out of cardboard tubes. To me it is the juxtaposition of history with something from the present. People were interacting with it really nicely, asking questions as they saw it moving around, others thought he must have lost his way from the souq and that is what I wanted to achieve. I called it Prayer on a Wheel. This is an example of how I tend to do my work -- take something from our past that is still used in our present and then redesign it in a new form and give it a new function -- and most of the time it is an artistic function -- to reintroduce it again. Recently I wanted to explore the gargour. They used to make them out of dry palm leaves but now they make them out of metal wire. With the help of craftsmen we joined the fish traps together to make a full sphere. The name of it was Present, Perfect and Continuous -- defining that this tool of fishing that was in the past can still be used in the present and can continue to be used in the future. More from Human to Hero: Chinese sculptor Xiang Jing's painful search for truth . I think Emirati artists are trying to invent their identity and create a regional style for Dubai. It is less challenging when you are a woman because they always think that art is your feminine side. I would like to see a lot of collaborations with Emirati and international artists or designers. (British designer) Stuart Haygarth created a light sculpture out of palm leaves with the help of Emirati artisans (at the recent Abu Dhabi Art Fair.) I would love to do this one day. People would see the possibilities we have got here. I think collaborations are very powerful because they mix the media from different backgrounds and when you put them together there are a lot of unexpected results.","Zeinab Al Hashemi is an Emirati mixed-media visual artist based in Dubai .

"(CNN) -- When I have spare time, one of my favorite ways to be of little-to-no use to society is going on Wikipedia and harnessing the power of the ""Random Article"" button. It's basically magic. You click it and it pulls up just one entry from among tens of millions. And sometimes it even has facts! Wikipedia's unofficial motto: ""Sure ... what that guy wrote."" As the name implies, when you click for a random article, you never know what you're going to get. It's random. But it's always the start of a fascinating ride down the giant time-wasting wiki wormhole where, as you click on more and more associated articles, an hour later you find you've somehow gone from, say, learning about electromagnetic radiation to reading up on Guns N' Roses. And then you eventually leave the wormhole because your brain has gone far too long without porn or cat videos. So, anyway, this week, for a little change of pace, instead of writing about a trending topic in social media, I'm going to click the ""Random Article"" button just once and write about the very first thing that pops up. No matter what it is. Because, you know, if it's on Wikipedia, it matters. Sort of. OK, here we go. ""Give me a click, Vasily. One click only, please."" (click) And our topic is: Jiri Ondracek! According to Wikipedia, Ondracek is a 24-year-old professional ice hockey player from Havirov, Czech Republic. Which is nowhere near Pittsburgh. I looked it up. You're welcome. Now, if you're not a hockey fan, please don't turn away. I promise I won't make this all about sports. The whole point of exploring random articles is to see where the wormhole takes you on the Web, to learn about new things and hopefully not end up watching a Nickelback video on YouTube. (The horror. The horror.) So let's learn! A quick visit to his team's website doesn't reveal anything overly interesting about Ondracek other than the fact that he's a forward who's 185 centimeters tall and weighs 82 kilograms. I'm an American so, clearly, I have no idea what the hell that means. For all I know he's 5 feet 3 inches and built like a Buick. Or as they call that on Internet dating sites: ""Curvy."" So, I used Google's metric converter and learned that he's actually about 6 feet tall and weighs roughly 180 pounds. Which sounds just about right for a real professional hockey player. By contrast, I played one season of club hockey my freshman year in college, but was 5 feet 9 inches and built like a malnourished fifth-grader. So I quit, took up sleeping in as my new club sport and decided to concentrate on pork rinds. I became: ""Curvy."" But back to Ondracek. His current team hails from the town of Zlin, which is in the southeastern part of the Czech Republic. It's OK. You're allowed to not know where it is. So do look at that map. And maybe even plan a visit. Zlin actually sounds rather interesting. In 2007, New York Times writer William Shaw called Zlin ""an architectural gold mine"" and mentioned that people used to joke about it being ""a piece of America, somehow misplaced here in the Czech Republic."" The architectural history of Zlin has roots in America, and dates back to the larger vision of a local shoemaker in the early 1900s. His name was Tomas Bata and, according to the article, he made several discovery trips to the United States, and even toured Ford factories to learn more about the intricacies of mass production. Bata came away from his visits to America with big ideas (and probably high cholesterol), and set forth to not only mass-produce his shoes, but to also mass-produce buildings specifically designed to enhance the lives of his workers. Schools. Housing. Hospitals. Maybe even a Denny's and a VD clinic. Just the basics. But Bata wanted to do it in style. So, the article says, he enlisted the help of some of Europe's most radical architects. ""Tell me, Sven. What do you envision for the hospital?"" ""No walls. Just fresh air. And we'll surround the exterior with open flames to symbolize the warmth of healing."" ""Right. How about just a fancy door."" Eventually, Bata's dream fizzled, but most of the buildings made it through the great wars and are still intact today. Thus, the ""architectural gold mine."" Though, if you're Ondracek, Zlin is probably just some place where you now play hockey. Nothing more. And that brings us right back where we started. The ""Random Article"" button.

"(CNN) -- If President Barack Obama's inaugural address was any indication, his second term will be a doubling down of the progressive, big government agenda. With that in mind, here is some advice for conservatives and the Republican Party for the next four years of Obama's presidency: . Don't blame the GOP leadership . First and foremost, if we are to prevail, we cannot afford to continue firing upon and wounding or maiming our own soldiers and officers. We need everyone in the fight. It is more difficult to be in a position of governance, such as John Boehner, Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan, than a journalist, pundit or conservative talk show host. Trust me, I've been in both arenas. It's much harder to be Boehner and the Republican leadership than it is to be Sean Hannity, Rush Limbaugh, Michael Medved, etc. Unlike those who operate solely in the arenas of commentary, opinion and philosophy, Republicans in Washington bear the responsibility and burden of actual governance, where ideological purity must often yield to compromise. Much of the blame placed at the feet of Republican leadership by many in the party or the commentariat lies not with the party or its leaders but ultimately, as in all things with a democratic republic, with the choice of the people. Opinion: Guns were last straw for me with GOP . Face reality . William Buckley aptly described conservatism as the politics of reality. As such, we must recognize the realities of political governance. You cannot govern unless you have power. That is, Republicans cannot govern with control of only one half of one third of the branches of government. They can block and prevent, but they cannot impose. Our agenda, our goals and our expectations should be oriented to these facts of reality. It's the culture, stupid . Conservatives are losing the culture war when, according to a 2011 Pew Research poll, 49% of Americans ages 18-29 have a positive view of socialism while just 46% have a positive view of capitalism. Such views are the products of our education system and the movies, music and entertainment young Americans consume. We must change those cultural institutions before we can truly change our political institutions in the long term. The roots of our cultural and educational outreach must be as far reaching as the left's. This means broadening our scope of influence outside Fox News and conservative talk radio and into the left's strongholds of Hollywood and higher education. Perhaps some of the hundreds of millions of dollars spent on PACs could be better spent taking back the culture. Play offense . In politics, as in sports, you're either on offense or you're on defense. Be on offense. This is a simple maxim, but one too often neglected. He who initiates sets the terms of debate and forces the dialogue on his terms. Gov. Scott Walker's aggressive fiscal reforms in Wisconsin are an example of effective political offense. Elevate the next generation . During the 2012 presidential primaries, conservatives often lamented the absence of rising Republican stars such as Sen. Marco Rubio, Gov. Bob McDonnell, Gov. Bobby Jindal, Gov. Susana Martinez, Gov. Scott Walker, Rep. Paul Ryan and so on. Our bench is strong, but now it's time for the bench to take the field. Politics: After inauguration, political reality returns to Washington . Consequences of big government . The American people must realize for what they voted when they re-elected Obama and a Democratic-controlled Senate. So far, they've been immunized from many of the consequences. But now, with the expiration of the payroll tax cut and the gradual implementation of ObamaCare, the taxes of almost all Americans have risen, along with many of their health care premiums. Conservatives must draw the direct link between higher taxes and premiums and Democratic policies. As St. Paul instructs, misery teaches lessons that success doesn't. The American people voted in big government, and they will be punished and made to pay for it in immiseration. Don't become cynical . Do not make people more cynical or pessimistic about politics or the political system. Every day on my radio show, I hear of people withdrawing from the political arena into a cocoon of disengagement and discouragement. We cannot allow this to happen. We must encourage the American people to be active and involved in important policy decisions. It was the great novelist Walker Percy who warned of America's downfall, not at the hand of a great outside power, but from crumbling within. Politics: Republicans assess Obama's address . ""Probably the fear of seeing America, with all its great strength and beauty and freedom ... gradually subside into decay through default and be defeated, not by the communist movement, but from within, from weariness, boredom, cynicism, greed and in the end helplessness before its great problems,"" Percy said. We must get our heads up. As Margaret Thatcher said to us often, ""Don't go wobbly,"" and, ""Cheer up. America is a strong country."" The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of William J. Bennett.","William Bennett: Here is some advice for the GOP in the second Obama term .
Bennett: Don't just blame GOP leadership; the choice of the people also matters .
He says conservatives must win the cultural war to change political institutions .
Bennett: The American people voted in big government, and they will be punished for it ."
"(CNN) -- Coinciding with this season's flu outbreak is an upsurge of another illness that can be dangerous, even deadly, especially for infants: respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). While most parents are familiar with the flu, many have never heard of RSV. It's the same virus that is the leading cause of the common cold -- and infects almost all children by age 2. ""The vast majority of kids who get RSV just have cold symptoms and get better,"" says Dr. Robert Wiskind, Georgia president of the American Academy of Pediatrics. ""A minority of them develop bronchiolitis (an inflammation of tiny air passages in the lungs specific to babies and young children) -- and a very small percentage have significant problems."" When RSV attacks the lungs, it is particularly dangerous for newborns and babies born prematurely. Pneumonia and other bronchial complications can set in quickly. RSV and other winter worries . It is an age-old, recurring illness -- most adults have been exposed countless times. Subsequent RSV infections usually are not as severe as the first. RSV, which generally circulates from late fall into the early spring, is out there with a myriad of other stuff floating around right now: Human metapneumovirus (hMPV), adenovirus and parainfluenza, all common respiratory viruses, and pertussis, the bacterial disease that causes whooping cough. Since patients often are treated without being tested, it's hard to know what's what. ""Just in general, when we look at cough and respiratory symptoms, there's a lot of overlap,"" said Dr. Susan Gerber, an epidemiologist at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). ""A lot of times, unless there is rigorous laboratory testing, you may not know the cause."" Vitamin D in pregnancy may protect infants from virus . With no official reporting of RSV, year-to-year comparisons are difficult to gauge except to say spikes are typical this time of year. In Boston, a city hit hard by the flu, Massachusetts General Hospital has more than 175 cases of RSV on the record so far this season. At the three pediatric hospitals that make up Children's Heathcare of Atlanta, some 545 youngsters have been treated for RSV since the beginning of December, according to the group's clinical microbiologist, Dr. Robert Jerris. Katie Dearborn's 2-month-old son, Cooper, recently spent three days in an Atlanta hospital. ""I brought him in because he was wheezing and coughing,"" she says. ""He had just learned to smile -- and he stopped smiling. He just looked sad."" Wiskind advises, ""You are the best judge of your child -- if it doesn't seem right to you, you should bring them in."" Serious symptoms . Parents should seek immediate medical attention if their children have any of these symptoms: . -- High fever . -- Severe cough . -- Wheezing . -- Difficulty breathing . -- Bluish-colored skin on the lips and nail beds . RSV spreads much like the flu -- exposure from others who are coughing or sneezing and by direct skin-to-skin contact. The virus can live for hours on contaminated surfaces such as toys. It is most contagious during first few days of infection. Treatment . Milder coldlike symptoms can be alleviated with proper humidity, over-the-counter pain relievers, nasal drops and extra fluids. Hospital treatment for serious cases may include antibiotics, IV fluids and humidified oxygen. Medications delivered in a fine mist can relieve wheezing. Cooper Dearborn tested positive for RSV but responded quickly following a procedure to clear his lungs of congestion. ""It was a little scary. I'm grateful to all of the nurses and doctors who kept me calm,"" his mother says. Prevention . Parents should take the same precautions for all respiratory illnesses: wash hands, limit contact with others who are sick, don't smoke and keep surfaces clean. For babies at highest risk -- those born prematurely, with congenital heart or lung disease -- there is one medication to help ward it off: Doctors may administer a series of injections (Palivizumab) as a protective measure. But it's an expensive treatment not indicated for general use. Preventive actions do pay off, Wiskind says. ""The number of fatalities from RSV has dropped significantly in recent years."" There currently is no vaccine for RSV. But ""we are hopeful,"" Gerber says. ""There are multiple candidates for a vaccine in development.""","RSV is caused by the same virus that's the leading cause of the common cold .
Most children recover without complications, but some have ""significant problems""
Serious cases may require hospitalization ."
"(CNN) -- Sunday saw the curtain fall on Europe's biggest domestic football leagues, with scenes of triumph and despair across the continent as teams battled for glory or survival. After a weekend which saw records broken and nerves shredded, CNN rounds up the final sets of fixtures in Spain, England, Italy and Germany and details the winners and the losers. For many of Europe's leading players, the focus will now switch from club to country at Euro 2012 in Ukraine and Poland next month. Spain . Real Madrid had already secured a 32nd Spanish title ahead of Sunday's final round of fixtures, but Jose Mourinho's team thrashed Real Mallorca 4-1 to finish the season on 100 points, a La Liga record. The victory meant Real finished nine points ahead of archrivals Barcelona in second, who said farewell to departing coach Pep Guardiola with a 2-2 draw at Real Betis Saturday. Valencia finished third in the table for the third season in a row, while big-spending Malaga, owned by Qatari Abdullah bin Nasser bin Abdullah Al Ahmed Al Thani, clinched the fourth and final European Champions League qualifying spot. Dutch striker Ruud van Nistelrooy announced his retirement following Malaga's 1-0 over Sporting Gijon, after a career which has seen the prolific former Netherlands striker star at Manchester United and Real Madrid. There was a shock at the bottom of the table, as 2006 Champions League semifinalists Villarreal slipped out of the top division for the first time in 12 years after losing 1-0 to Europa League winners Atletico Madrid. Villarreal, who finished fourth last season, will be joined in the second tier by Sporting Gijon and Racing Santander, who placed 19th and 20th respectively. Top goalscorer: Lionel Messi, Barcelona - 50 . England . Manchester City scored two goals in stoppage time to beat Queens Park Rangers 3-2 and pip neighbors Manchester United to the English Premier League title on goal difference. United looked to have done enough to clinch a 20th title after Wayne Rooney's header gave them a 1-0 win at Sunderland. Did City win the title - or did United lose it? But in a dramatic finale Edin Dzeko and Sergio Aguero scored in the 92nd and 94th minutes to hand Roberto Mancini's City a first championship in 44 years. QPR were battling against relegation, but their top-flight status was secured after Bolton Wanderers could only draw 2-2 with Stoke City. Bolton needed to win to remain in the division, but the draw meant they were demoted alongside Blackburn Rovers and Wolverhampton Wanderers. Behind City and United, Arsenal beat West Bromwich Albion 3-2 to secure the third and final automatic qualification berth for next season's Champions League. Tottenham Hotspur finished fourth and Harry Redknapp's team will play in Europe's elite club competition next season if Chelsea, who placed sixth, lose to Bayern Munich in Saturday's Champions League final. Top goalscorer: Robin van Persie, Arsenal - 30 . Italy . Champions Juventus finished with a 3-1 victory over Atalanta, a win which meant the Turin club were undefeated throughout the entire 38-game Serie A season. The match was marked by a goal from the club's all-time leading goalscorer Alessandro del Piero, the 37-year-old striker who is leaving Juventus at the end of the season after 19 years with the Bianconeri. Filippo Inzaghi was another Italian legend to sign off with a goal, as the 38-year-old found the net on his final appearance for second-placed AC Milan in a 2-1 win against relegated Novara. Udinese's fourth straight victory, a 2-0 triumph at Catania, was enough for them to finish third and claim the last Champions League spot. Lecce needed a win to have any hope of staying in the top flight, but a 1-0 loss to Chievo condemned them to Serie B football next season, alongside 19th-placed Novara and bottom club Cesena. Top goalscorer: Zlatan Ibrahimovic, AC Milan - 28 . Germany . Borussia Dortmund went into the final weekend of German domestic action having already sealed a second consecutive Bundesliga crown, and completed the double Saturday by winning the German Cup with a 5-2 victory over arch-rivals Bayern Munich. Jurgen Klopp's team finished eight points ahead of Bayern, who will face Chelsea at their own Allianz Arena home in the Champions League final. Schalke will join Dortmund and Bayern in next season's Champions League after cementing third place, while Borussia Monchengladbach will enter the qualifying rounds of the competition after finishing fourth. Four-time German champions Kaiserlautern endured a miserable campaign, finishing bottom. Cologne will join them in Bundesliga 2 next season after finishing 17th. Hertha Berlin were the third and final team to be relegated. The club from the German capital were beaten 4-3 on aggregate by Fortuna Dusseldorf, who finished third in Bundesliga 2, in a two-legged playoff. It means Fortuna will return to the top division next season for the first time in 15 years. Top goalscorer: Klaas Jan Huntelaar, Schalke - 29 .","Real Madrid end the Spanish season with a record 100 points after a 4-1 win over Mallorca .

"(CNN) -- Pete (Paul Rudd), the floppy-haired hero of Judd Apatow's winningly nimble and close-to-the-bone family-mishegoss comedy ""This Is 40,"" is a married father of two in L.A. who escapes the frazzled swirl of his existence by engaging in deep, dark secret activities. He eats chocolate cupcakes â many, many more of them than his wife, Debbie (Leslie Mann), a major nutritional scold, would suspect. And when he's feeling beyond overwhelmed, he heads for the bathroom with his tablet to access ... his favorite porn site? No, to play Internet Scrabble. It's a sign of what his life has become that this is his notion of a grand escape, an oasis of me-time. If neither of these jokes strikes an amused chord of recognition in you, then you may find ""This Is 40"" to be mildly funny at best. But if they do resonate, you may chuckle, with knowing pleasure, throughout the movie. '30 Rock' wraps filming, tweets a photo . The comedies that put Apatow on the map (""Knocked Up,"" ""The 40 Year-Old Virgin"") took off from broadly italicized concepts, but ""This Is 40"" lets you know in its title that it's less about a concept than a state of being. Pete and Debbie were supporting characters in ""Knocked Up,"" and now they're turning 40, with two lovely daughters (nicely played by Apatow's own daughters, Maude and Iris) and two crusty fathers (a terrific Albert Brooks and John Lithgow), who each have young families of their own. The couple still love each other, but their relationship is a mess â a whirlwind of fights, lies, negotiations, teamwork, good sex, bad sex, and general confusion. The whole tone of the movie is spontaneous, rolling, experiential. It's got some laugh-out-loud lines, especially when the two jump into the politics of Sadie's middle school, or when Pete is dealing with the business he owns, a struggling boutique music label devoted to the white-guy indie rockers he grew up with and still thinks are cool. The joke is no one else does â not even Graham Parker (playing a version of himself), Pete's latest relic-legend, who knows his records won't sell. 'Hobbit' looks tough to beat at box office . That said, a lot of the best gags in ""This Is 40"" are the ones that percolate between the lines. The comedy is there in how Pete leaps like a puppy to do his wife's bidding, without realizing that he's already in the doghouse for not having taken the initiative himself; or in the way that Apatow never once stages a marital-therapy session â but has Pete and Debbie lapse into the euphemisms of therapy-speak, even as it still sounds like they want to kill each other. ""This Is 40"" isn't always hilarious, but it's ticklishly honest and droll about all the things being a parent can do to a relationship. And why it's still worth it. A- .

"(EW.com) -- In the popular Lee Child thrillers from which ""Jack Reacher"" has been fashioned, the title character's physical dimensions are integral to his mysterious-loner-silent-drifter-violent-hero stature: He's 6' 5'', brawny, and blond. So Tom Cruise, who is not, has his work cut out for him in his mission to impress both those who already have strong notions about how Reacher ought to look and those just now meeting the freelance one-man justice league and trying to take his measure. That Cruise fails to make a case for Reacher's allure, though, has less to do with physical dissonance than it does with the film's inability â stupefying inability, really â to otherwise make a case for the character's originality in a movie so choked with visual clichÃ©s and dreadfully moldy dialogue. Written and directed by Christopher McQuarrie (who previously worked with Cruise on ""Valkyrie""), ""Jack Reacher"" stumbles around looking for a unifying narrative tone, while the star soldiers on, offering up his generic action-hero stance of calm, opaque concentration. (An obligatory shirtless shot of Cruise confirms that his famous discipline in all things physical and mental still pays off.) EW: Best and worst nudity of 2012 . The story, meanwhile, is run-of-the-mill muscular pulp. While all evidence points to a former military sniper in the apparently random shooting of five victims, JR follows his own instincts â calmly, opaquely, except when he's a coldly violent fighting machine â and draws his own conclusions. Along the way, he crosses paths with a Russian mobster sinister enough to sound exactly like Werner Herzog, maybe because Herzog plays said mobster with lip-smacking gusto and a display of tiny teeth. And Reacher works side by side with a Blond Lady DA â probably as good a name for her as any, since British beauty Rosamund Pike (""An Education"") is given a Jane Doe of a role to work with.

"(CNN) -- A former Florida police officer convicted of multiple murders in the 1980s is scheduled to be executed Tuesday, and his attorneys are still working to save his life. Manuel Pardo, 56, was convicted of nine counts of first-degree murder in 1988 and was sentenced to death. Pardo's attorneys argued in federal court Monday that Florida's recent change in the drug combination it uses for lethal injections would violate their client's civil rights. Attorney William McKinley Hennis III told U.S. Judge Timothy Corrigan that if the drugs were to be improperly mixed, the anesthetic effects would be compromised. ""Manny Pardo would be the first inmate to be executed using that new lethal injection protocol,"" Hennis said. Corrigan denied the complaint, and Hennis said he would appeal the ruling. In another legal filing, the Supreme Court of Florida denied Pardo's argument that he should have never been tried in 1988 because he was incompetent to stand trial. David Waksman, who prosecuted the case, dismissed the claim, saying, ""He was just a cold-blooded killer who used to be a cop."" Pardo's life started on the other side of the law, according to court documents filed by his attorneys. At age 17, he enlisted in the Navy and served honorably served from 1974 to 1978. In 1981, Pardo re-enlisted in the Marines and remained a reservist while he worked for the Florida Highway Patrol and the Sweetwater, Florida, Police Department. In 1985 Pardo was fired from the police department and left the reserves when, according to court documents, ""he falsely testified in court about police corruption in the Bahamas."" Hennis said the stress of losing his job, compounded with a serious undiagnosed disease, turned him into ""someone he was not,"" a killer. During his trial, Pardo took the stand and admitted to the murders. ""He came up with this vigilante story,"" recalls Waksman. ""He said, 'I'm ridding the community of this vermin and technically it is not murder because they're not human beings.'"" The only chance Pardo has to win on the competency issue is if the United States Supreme Court decides to hear his appeal. The execution is scheduled for 6 p.m. Tuesday at Florida State Prison in Starke, Florida. Read more: Life sentence closes oldest cold case . Read more: MS-13 gang member gets 76 years .

"(CNN) -- Imagine if Dear Abby had been a Cuban feminist living in New York's Spanish Harlem. Imagine she was a lesbian with gravitas, an immigrant rights activist with spunk, sass and a wickedly mischievous sense of humor -- and you have Dolores Prida, an advice columnist widely known and beloved in the Latino community. She died this weekend, at 69, and her dignified and elegant persona, her significance in New York's theater world, its artistic community, Hispanic life, and journalism cannot be overstated, even if you've never heard of her. An oldest of three children, Ms. Prida, who was born in a CabairiÃ©n, Cuba, came to New York City in 1961 with her siblings and parents, and before long worked in the theater. She would go on to be a playwright, and among the most important plays she wrote was ""Beautiful SeÃ±oritas,"" a searing exploration of the role of women in society. It was written two decades ago, but many of the issues that plagued women then, particularly immigrant women, are still being negotiated today: how to balance the desire for a meaningful career with being a mother and wife when you're stuck in traditional, strict, and suffocating gender roles. She also taught classes at several colleges and wrote political columns for the New York Daily News and El Diario. But it was in her role as the voice behind Latina magazine's advice column, Dolores Dice, (Dolores Says) where Ms. Prida's generous spirit, lyrical eloquence and playful wit would find its glory. I had the pleasure of hiring her when I was Latina's editor-in-chief 15 years ago. Though the column name was a sweet coincidence -- a play on the Spanish verb for pain, dolor -- once Ms. Prida took it over in the spring of 1998, it took fabulous form. This was the Hispanic woman's answer to Dear Abby. Ms. Prida gave the column guts and grit. In one of her last responses, published in the current issue of Latina, a woman from Texas who described herself as being ""white and Puerto Rican"" longed to be proud of her heritage. News: Dolores Prida, ""Latina Dear Abby,"" dies . Ms. Prida's response: ""When you say you can pass for either, 'depending on how I dress, wear make up and do my hair,' you are stereotyping yourself based on an imagined cultural identity centered on looks and behaviors. Latinas do not wear their hair or behave in any particular way. We come in every shape and form. Be yourself."" The zinger? ""And stop hanging out with people who judge you based on your hairstyle or outburst of sassiness. Let them think whatever."" In a 1998 column that was vintage Dolores, a reader sought advice: ""I'm married, but I've fallen in love with the young man who works at the corner store. He doesn't know it yet. I don't know what to do. --Iris."" The answer? ""Dear Iris: Do your shopping elsewhere. Pronto!"" --Dolores"" Ms. Prida's work as an advice columnist was remarkable because of the many lenses through which she viewed life, among them: immigrant, Cuban exile, poet, community activist, sister, friend, mentor, immigrant rights advocate, lesbian, cook, smartass -- a candid soul filled with wisdom and fully-lived experiences. She'd been born in 1943 and she delivered good old-fashioned wisdom for women of the 21st century. It's almost a poetic irony that a woman whose name in Spanish means many pains brought so many of us so much joy and light. Hours before dying of a heart attack, Ms. Prida celebrated the 20th anniversary of LIPS, ""Latinas In Power, Sort Of,"" a women's group that we are both part of. But there is nothing ""sort of"" about this unofficial group of gals. Among its members are a publisher of a large metro newspaper, several Emmy and Pulitzer winners, writers, lawyers, producers. There's even a Justice in the group, as in Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who decided to pay a surprise visit that night to toast our enduring friendships. Near midnight Ms. Prida complained of a slight stomachache and left quietly, as if not to disturb the flow. She did not say goodbye, but earlier in the evening she'd revealed to the group that she would be 70 this year. She could hardly believe it herself. Neither could we. She looked radiant and bursting with energy and ideas. A few blocks from her house, we later learned, she called her sister and asked her to pick her up, as she was not feeling well. Her sister found her. During the ride to the hospital, the paramedics asked her name, and Ms. Prida instead of repeating her information, responded by telling them that she was just at a party and she was dancing -- that she was dancing for joy. She died several hours later at Mount Sinai Hospital, surrounded by her two sisters and niece. She'd been working on a book, ""How to Become an American in 100 Films"" and told me that finishing was a challenge because she wasn't sure she wanted to include modern flicks. She didn't care much for them; she loved the black and white classics. Of course she did: Classic, like her.

"(CNN) -- With Friday's defiant statement, the National Rifle Association massed its troops along familiar fronts in the culture war -- and even opened some new battle lines. But it also squandered an opportunity to participate in reasonable dialogue with an America that has begun losing its appetite for political extremism. Longtime NRA Executive Vice President Wayne LaPierre, eager to keep the rank-and-file ""mothers and fathers"" among his membership from going soft, sounded themes critical to maintaining gun owners' collective identity and solidarity. These themes included: . The NRA is reasonable and a good citizen. Consistent with past practice, LaPierre recounted the NRA's horror at the Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre and stated its silence came out of respect for the victims. Others exploit such tragedies, LaPierre said, but the NRA and its members are better than that. Did the NRA miss an opportunity? More guns, less crime. That is the title of the NRA's bible, a 1998 book by Yale professor John Lott (whose core findings have been refuted by other scholars), and it is the logic behind the NRA's proposal to put an armed officer in all 140,000 American schools. The proposal is founded on the NRA's position that guns are merely tools that can be used by ""monsters"" or by ""good guys."" The NRA and its allies are good guys. The great divide: Little common ground with pro- and anti-gun forces . Gun owners are the victims. To the NRA, gun ownership is fundamental to virtuous citizenship. Go to any NRA convention, or look around the group's website, and you will learn that gun owners are the true American patriots, the only force standing between democracy and a tyrannical state delivered by emotional elites with naive but dangerous ideas. When LaPierre said he was there to deliver ""the truth,"" he was referring to elites' ""false"" belief that even modest gun regulations might work. When he talked about ""political prejudice"" or ""personal prejudice,"" he was referring to the indignities that beleaguered gun owners suffer in a society that has failed to appreciate their civic contributions. This is the NRA's perspective on the culture war. While these themes are familiar, LaPierre broke with precedent in key ways, most significantly with his explosive broadside against journalists, movie studios, video game producers, record labels and elected officials who have failed to embrace the NRA's policy goals. If you want to blame someone besides the shooter for Sandy Hook, then blame the ""enablers"" and NRA haters and purveyors of ""dishonest thinking."" LaPierre's attempt to shift the focus to anything but guns was predictable, but the particular message may have some resonance. A Pew Research Center poll found that 47% of Americans -- including 54% of women -- thought the Sandy Hook massacre reflected broader social problems, such as parental failures, moral and religious decline, a general devaluation of life, violent depictions in the media and problems with mental health and its treatment. Although 18% cited easy access to guns -- the most popular single answer -- the poll showed that Americans are far more likely to see gun massacres in a broader context. iReport: Why would someone own a military-style rifle? A similar pattern emerged after the Columbine High School shooting in 1999 when Americans were much more likely to place the blame on family and cultural factors than on failures of gun policy. Of course, as with airplane crashes and other disasters, gun massacres are the product of many interacting forces, as is the ""everyday"" gun violence that occurs outside the media spotlight. Most Americans understand the causes are complex and are sensible enough to see that a multipronged approach involving personal, social and public policy action will be needed. LaPierre's apocalyptic vision of the ""unknown number of genuine monsters"" who at this very moment may be plotting the next attack on our schoolchildren -- and the organization's single-minded and unrealistic call to put an armed guard immediately in all our schools -- felt weirdly out of step with the equally urgent yet more thoughtful conversations occurring at dinner tables around the nation. It was a missed opportunity. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Kristin A. Goss.","Kristin Goss: National Rifle Association's statement brought out familiar cultural wars .

"Chicago, Illinois (CNN) -- Synagogues across metropolitan Chicago, Illinois, began taking ""appropriate precautions"" Friday after a warning by security officials to watch out for suspicious packages from abroad, according to a Jewish Federation spokeswoman. President Barack Obama said that two packages that apparently contained explosive materials were bound for two synagogues in Chicago. While there were ""no identifiable or specific threats,"" an FBI official in Chicago said suspicious packages addressed to U.S. destinations found on cargo planes abroad warranted the precautions. ""Since two of the suspicious packages that were intercepted were addressed to religious institutions in Chicago, all churches, synagogues and mosques in the Chicago area should be vigilant for any unsolicited or unexpected packages, especially those originating from overseas locations,"" said FBI Special Agent Ross Rice. The Jewish Federation of Metropolitan Chicago was contacted by federal officials Friday morning to urge the organization to be on alert for suspicious packages, spokeswoman Linda Haase said. ""We are taking appropriate precautions, and we are advising local synagogues to do the same,"" Haase said. The Anti-Defamation League said it alerted synagogues across the United States to increase mailroom security after federal security officials informed the organization of ""a reported threat to Jewish institutions in the form of packages mailed from overseas, particularly Great Britain, Yemen and Saudi Arabia."" Haase said she had not heard reports of Chicago congregations altering plans for services on Friday evening, the beginning of the Jewish Sabbath. ""We generally pay careful attention to packages coming to the synagogue, accepting only those we're expecting or from a known sender,"" Steven Bob, the rabbi at a synagogue in the western Chicago suburbs. ""Today we were extra careful."" Bob said that there was plenty of email and phone traffic among Chicago Jewish leaders responding to news of the plot on Friday but that he didn't think worshippers would be deterred from Friday services. ""We live in a world that contains some people that are hostile to us and we want to respond to that hostility with caution,"" said Bob, who leads Etz Chaim in Lombard, Illinois.

"New York (CNN) -- A man who ambushed firefighters Monday, fatally shooting two of them as they arrived to put out a raging inferno in upstate New York, took his own life with gunshot to the head, according to an autopsy conducted by the Monroe County Medical Examiner's Office. Two other volunteer firefighters were wounded in the attack in the Rochester-area town of Webster. Authorities do not know how William Spengler, 62, who was found dead hours after the four firefighters were shot, obtained the weapon or weapons he used or why he opened fire.

As a convicted felon, Spengler could not legally possess guns, but he had ""several different types of weapons,"" Webster Police Chief Gerald Pickering said. Spengler was convicted in 1981 of first-degree manslaughter in the death of his grandmother and had been released on supervised parole. ""It appears that it was a trap,"" Pickering said.

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- An American-born Israeli man, described by police as a ""Jewish terrorist,"" is mentally unstable and in need of psychiatric help, his attorney told CNN Monday. Israeli authorities Sunday announced the arrest of Yaakov ""Jack"" Teitel, 37, a West Bank settler who was arrested last month. Israeli police and security forces say he has been charged in connection with a string of attacks and murder plots over the past 12 years against Arabs, homosexuals, leftists, messianic Jews and police forces. Teitel's attorney Adi Keidar said his client has admitted to the 1997 shooting of a Palestinian man and laying explosive devices -- in addition to other crimes that he was not involved in, particularly the August shooting attack on a Tel Aviv gay youth club that killed two people. Police said that Teitel initially claimed responsibility for the attack, but they are still unsure about the identity of the shooter. Keidar said he has yet to see the full indictment against his client. Teitel sees himself as an emissary of God, who has come to eradicate all the profanities against God, according to Keidar. He said he believes Teitel is in need of immediate psychiatric evaluation. Teitel, 37, was arrested last month in Jerusalem after hanging posters in support of the Tel Aviv attack. ""He was like a serial killer. This guy was a Jewish terrorist who targeted different types of people,"" police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said. ""He was deeply involved in terrorism on all different levels"". According to police, the long series of attacks began in 1997, when Teitel entered Israel as a tourist and managed to smuggle a handgun on board a British Airways flight to Tel Aviv. Teitel's first victim, police said, was Samir Balbisi, an east Jerusalem cab driver who was shot and killed. Two months later, the same gun was used to shoot and kill a Palestinian shepherd in the South Hebron Hills. Teitel was interrogated by police following the second killing but denied any involvement in the act and was later released. Teitel moved to Israel in 2000, into the West Bank settlement of Shvut Rachel, married and has four young children. According to Shin Bet, Israel's security agency, Teitel's father, who now lives in Israel as well, served as a dentist in the U.S. Marines during the Vietnam War. It is believed Teitel was first introduced to weapons and explosives during his time living on American military bases. In 2008 Teitel allegedly planted a bomb inside a package delivered to a house of a messianic Jewish family. Ami Ortiz, a 15 year old boy suffered serious injuries in the attack, police said. Next on Teitel's list of targets, police said, was Israel Prize laureate Zeev Sternhell. Teitel admitted in planting explosives at Sternhell's doorstep in September last year. Sternhell, a prominent left-wing activist was lightly wounded, according to police. Harsh questions were raised in the Israeli press Monday on how an alleged killer was able to escape the hands of the law for over 12 years and emphasized the difficulty of security forces in tracking Israeli terrorists. Shin Bet described Teitel as a lone wolf who did not confess his acts to anyone and carefully calculated his moves in order not to get caught. He did not learn the Hebrew language in all his years in Israel, they said. CNN's Michal Zippori and Guy Azriel contributed to this report.","Israel on Sunday announced the arrest of American-born Yaakov Teitel on terror charges .

The number of those injured is still unclear, he said. Pokomo tribesmen initiated the attacks, according to Khadija Kuresha, a human rights activist in the area. Both sides have engaged in retaliatory clashes in recent months. It's unclear what triggered the latest clashes, but the two groups have fought for years over grazing rights, land and water sources. Pokomos are largely farmers while the semi-nomadic Orma tribesmen mostly tend to livestock. The former have accused the latter of grazing cattle on land that does not belong to them. Violence between the two escalated after an August confrontation killed more than 50 people in the same region. Kenya has dispatched hundreds of officers to the area in recent months, but authorities in the east African nation have been criticized for failing to stop the carnage.","Red Cross: Clashes between Pokomo and Orma tribes leave 32 dead .

"(CNN) -- 1. Everpurse: A handbag that charges your phone . Nothing kills a productive day like a dead cell phone battery. Lucky for us, that's what inspired frustrated social worker Liz Salcedo to create Everpurse. The inventive solution allows you to charge your mobile device simply by placing it inside your handbag. Salcedo and her husband/business partner designed a bag with a built-in pocket that automatically connects to the charger via gravity. Using the same wireless technology as some Nokia products, each bag is equipped with a receiver and battery inside its lining, pulling off a crafty nontechnical look. The couple took their prototype to the crowd funding website Kickstarter.com, where they found more than 900 backers and raised over $150,000 in support of their project. The future of wireless charging not only looks promising, but stylish as well! 2. Facedeals: Reading your face to give you better deals . When you hear the words ""facial recognition technology,"" do they creep you out? A Tennessee-based ad agency called Redpepperland thinks that using the technology to give shoppers customized in-store deals may get them past their apprehension. The concept, called ""Facedeals,"" is an automated check-in system that uses passive facial recognition to send customized in-store deals right to your smart phone. Here's how it works: A Facedeals camera installed at a store entrance scans and recognizes your face as you walk in the door. Don't worry if you don't like the idea -- you have to opt in to participate by creating an account through their Facebook profile. Once you're checked in, the types of deals you are offered depends on your history of Facebook likes. Although the project is not yet directly affiliated with Facebook, the idea is to get businesses to realize that Facebook check-ins are a powerful tool to provide discounts to loyal customers. Another inventive use of facial recognition comes from a new service called Plum Perfect, which offers makeup palette suggestions based on a photo of your face. 3. Smart Carpet: Carpet sensors that can tell when you fall . It looks like we finally have a real-life magic carpet -- only it won't fly you to your favorite vacation destination. Researchers at the University of Manchester in the UK have designed a ""smart carpet"" that can tell when a person has fallen. Sensors embedded in the carpet allow it to detect and map walking patterns in real time by acting as a pressure map. Once the signals are recorded by computer, the carpet can also sense any deterioration in walking behavior. If this occurs, it analyzes the force of a fall against a footstep and can be rigged to call for help. Right now, the goal is to implement smart carpets in care homes and hospitals as a safety measure to decrease the number of emergency admissions due to falls for the 65+ age group. 4. Lockitron: Lock your house with your smartphone . We've all done it before: You're running late, grab everything you can remember and run out the door trying to beat the clock. It's not until you've almost reached your destination that the nagging ""Did-I-lock-the-door?"" question rears its head. Lockitron is offering a solution to this common worry by turning your smartphone into a house key. What makes Lockitron different from other ""digital house key"" apps like Unikey is that it is installed onto existing deadbolts and connects to the Internet via Wi-Fi, which allows you to access it from anywhere. The device is powered by AA batteries and runs Bluetooth or NFC (Near Field Communication) technology, depending on which device you use. ""Knock sensors"" can even be installed to send you a notification when someone is at the door. 5. Wallbrights: Customizable wall dÃÂ©cor . If you're looking to add a little pizzazz to your household with some wall dÃÂ©cor, this one is definitely an eye catcher. Wallbrights combines simple wall decals with LED lights that are remotely controlled by -- what else? -- a mobile app. The decals, which come in both hexagons and lines, are equipped with an adhesive backing so you can change the pattern and stick them just about anywhere in your home. Using a smartphone app, you can not only turn the lights off and on, but also control the color scheme. So whether you are looking for colors that suit your mood or just add style to your walls, this lighting innovation is sure to spark conversation.","Start the new year with some tools and trends that could make life easier .

"(CNN) -- Written off by all and sundry as the most expensive flop in English Premier League history, Fernando Torres is seemingly back in business. Four goals in two games have transformed the misfiring striker from the on-pitch personification of Chelsea's recent problems to perhaps the man who can earn Rafael Benitez a bit more time in the club's managerial hotseat. ""I said before that if the team play well and create chances he will score goals,"" Benitez said after Torres netted twice in Saturday's 3-1 win at Sunderland -- Chelsea's first victory in eight EPL games. ""It's fair to say that we are watching a Torres with more confidence and belief. I was analyzing his movements and adjusting a few things. It's a question of confidence and differences in movements. The most important thing is that he appears confident."" The victory kept Chelsea third ahead of Sunday's Manchester derby -- seven points behind leaders United and four adrift of second-placed City. It capped a week which started with Chelsea's embarrassing group-stage exit from the Champions League and which will end with the squad traveling to Japan for the Club World Cup. Torres ended his two-month drought with two goals in Wednesday's 6-1 thrashing of Danish team Nordsjaelland, but the next day he had an immediate reminder of his earlier struggles from the man he is seeking to follow as a Chelsea hero. Didier Drogba, back training with the club to keep fit for next month's Africa Cup of Nations, put on a lavish dinner for last season's Champions League-winning team -- spending a reported $1.3 million as he had special commemorative rings made for his former colleagues. Torres did not attend the affair laid on by the player who kept him out of the Chelsea starting lineup following his $80 million move from Liverpool -- Drogba, the fan favorite who finally delivered the European title that owner Roman Abramovich has always craved, with his last kick for the club before moving to China. Whether it served as a catalyst for Saturday's performance, only Torres knows, but the Spain international shrugged off the lethargy that followed his promising start to this season as he looked more like the man who starred for Benitez at Liverpool. Torres opened the scoring in the 11th minute from Eden Hazard's cross for his first in the EPL since October 6, and made it 2-0 at halftime with his first successful penalty in English football after Sebastian Larsson tripped Ramires. Torres hit the crossbar soon after the break, but compatriot Juan Mata followed up to score, and Sunderland dropped into the relegation zone despite a consolation from Adam Johnson. It was Benitez's first league win in four games since replacing the sacked Roberto Di Matteo, a hugely unpopular appointment with the Chelsea fans. ""Little by little we are adjusting things, but if we have more confidence, with the quality we have we will win games,"" said the Spanish coach, who will now seek to repeat his 2010 Club World Cup success with Inter Milan -- after which he was promptly sacked having fallen out with players and officials at the Italian club. ""It's important to have an opportunity to win any trophy, but especially this one,"" Benitez said. ""It was a great experience for me and I hope it will be for my players. I got to the final in 2005 and won the tournament in 2010."" Arsenal ended a four-match winless run by beating fifth-placed West Brom 2-0 thanks to two penalties from Mikel Arteta -- the first coming after an apparent dive from fellow Spanish midfielder Santi Cazorla. ""There was zero contact, it wasn't even close. I am not sure what the referee saw,"" West Brom manager Steve Clarke said. ""It was a bad decision for us and obviously changed the shape of the afternoon. We knew the longer the game went the more pressure would come on Arsenal."" Arsene Wenger's team had dropped to 10th after last weekend's defeat by Swansea, but climbed back up to sixth as the London side bounced back from the midweek Champions League loss to Olympiakos. Norwich's 4-3 win at eighth-placed Swansea was marred by the arrest of one of the home team's fans for an alleged racist gesture. Norwich's Cameroon defender Sebastien Bassong complained after being abused following a second-half goal from Robert Snodgrass that put Norwich 4-2 ahead. ""Within 10 minutes of the report the stewards had got hold of the TV footage, replayed it, identified the alleged person in question and within that period he was arrested for a racially aggravated public order offense,"" said a Swansea spokesman. ""The matter is with the police, but from the club's point of view we abhor racism and we have worked hard over the years to make this a family club. We will look into it and a further statement will follow in due course."" Spanish striker Michu scored twice for Swansea to move top of the EPL scoring charts with 12, lifting him above Manchester United's Robin van Persie and Liverpool's Luis Suarez. Torres now has six, and 11 in all competitions this season. Southampton moved out of the bottom three for the first time this season, beating fellow promoted side Reading 1-0 to be equal on points with Aston Villa and Wigan. Villa drew 0-0 with mid-table Stoke, while two goals from James McCarthy earned Wigan a 2-2 draw with bottom club Queens Park Rangers. QPR set a new record of 16 EPL games without a win, beating Swindon's unwanted mark from the 1993-94 season, as new manager Harry Redknapp had to settle for a third successive draw despite taking a second-half lead through striker Djibril Cisse following defender Ryan Nelsen's first-half equalizer.","Fernando Torres scores twice for the second time this week in Chelsea victory .

"(CNN) -- Now that embattled U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Susan Rice has withdrawn her name from secretary of state consideration, attention is turning toward Sen. John Kerry, D-Massachusetts, the other top candidate to replace outgoing Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. Republicans opposed to a Rice nomination have bandied about Kerry's name for weeks, and Thursday, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell told CNN that Kerry would be a ""popular choice with the Senate."" It's ironic that several prominent Republicans are rallying behind Kerry, just eight years after their party demonized him during his failed 2004 presidential campaign against President George W. Bush. Kerry remembered that experience in a statement he released about Rice. ""As someone who has weathered my share of political attacks and understands on a personal level just how difficult politics can be, I've felt for her throughout these last difficult weeks, but I also know that she will continue to serve with great passion and distinction,"" Kerry said. If Kerry replaces Clinton, who replaces him? The senior senator from Massachusetts is noted for the experience, gravitas and relationship-building skills that could help him succeed as the United States' top diplomat. In his current role as chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Kerry has traveled the globe on behalf of the Obama administration to mend frayed relationships. Most notably he has traveled to Pakistan after a series of incidents, including the raid that killed Osama bin Laden, that had set relations back. World travel is second nature to Kerry. While he was born in Denver, on December 11, 1943, he spent much of his childhood overseas, living in Berlin, then went to a Swiss boarding school at age 11. Obama's cabinet: Who's in, who's out? After graduating from Yale University in 1966, Kerry was deployed to Vietnam as a lieutenant in the U.S. Navy. Kerry served as a gunboat officer on the Mekong Delta, earning the Silver Star, the Bronze Star and three Purple Hearts. Upon his return home in the early 1970s, Kerry gained public recognition as the head of the group Vietnam Veterans Against the War and for his anti-war testimony before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Rice vs. Kerry: Weighing the odds . In 1972, Kerry ran his first campaign, a losing effort for a congressional seat in Massachusetts. He eventually entered politics in 1982 as lieutenant governor under Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis. Two years later, Kerry won the U.S. Senate seat he has held for five consecutive terms. The Vietnam experience came back to haunt Kerry during the 2004 presidential election. A Republican-funded group called ""Swift Boat Veterans for Truth"" aired campaign ads accusing Kerry of lying to receive two of his five combat decorations and criticizing his anti-war activism. The incumbent Bush won the Electoral College vote 292 to 252 and racked up 3 million more votes than Kerry nationwide. After winning his fifth senate race in 2008, Kerry took over the Senate Foreign Relations Committee the next January. And while Kerry has a powerful voice outside the Obama administration in his current role, with Rice out of the running, a path to the Cabinet has one less obstacle for the man Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona, jokingly called ""Mr. Secretary"" last week. Read more: Rice once looked like shoo-in . Ted Barrett and Jamie Crawford contributed to this report from Washington.","Sen.

"(CNN) -- If every generation has a moment where they adopt a rose-colored perspective of the people and pop culture of its past, the 20-somethings had their turn in 2011. Those who came of age in the '80s and '90s now span the demographic that's exiting college or creeping into their 30s. As they do so, various cultural outlets are recreating or referencing the TV shows, movies, fashion and music on which they were raised. This year, we were reacquainted with the staccato giggles of the animated ""Beavis and Butt-Head,"" which returned to MTV after originally appearing on the network from 1993 to 1997. And then, in perhaps the biggest TV flashback, was TeenNick 's weekly late-night block of programming, ""The '90s Are All That."" At the box office, 1994's ""The Lion King"" was re-released in 3-D in September, and we can now expect 1991's ""Beauty and the Beast"" and 1989's ""The Little Mermaid"" to be theatrically re-released in 3-D as well. It's the same deal with James Cameron's 1997 blockbuster ""Titanic,"" which will also be back in theaters in 3-D in the spring. Not to mention ""The Muppets"" being dusted off for another theatrical jaunt this year, courtesy of ""How I Met Your Mother"" star Jason Segel (a series that thrives on the theme of nostalgia and looking back). This year was kind to the musicians of the '90s, as NKOTBSB -- the supergroup made up of New Kids on the Block and the Backstreet Boys -- pulled in $40 million with their tour, according to the Hollywood Reporter. And if that wasn't enough, the very depiction of '90s whimsy, Lisa Frank, has added clothing to its swath of school supplies. Of course, they'd be remiss to not have adult sizes. It seems that while the kids have grown up, a lot of the culture that surrounds them hasn't. 'You sort of want to relive your youth' ""Trends tend to be really cyclical, but we're also in the Facebook generation, and these are the people who are the most visible online and have the biggest presence,"" said Robyn Ross, staff editor for TVGuide.com. ""As you come out of college and you're looking for a job, you're looking back at your childhood as the days when you didn't have to work and didn't have to think about a career; that's the perfect time to be nostalgic. You sort of want to relive your youth."" This theory could be especially applicable now, as young Americans are trying to navigate the murky waters of the economy and their future prospects. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the proportion of young adults living at home with parents has increased between 2005 and 2011 with 19% of men ages 25-34 living with parents these days as compared with 14% in 2005. For women, that shift went from 8% to 10% in the same time frame. It wouldn't be surprising if everyone wanted to go back to when Mayim Bialik was just ""Blossom"" instead of ""The Big Bang Theory's"" Amy Farrah Fowler. And to that extent, ""executives are capitalizing on that,"" says TVGuide.com's Ross. Indeed, Nickelodeon's TeenNick launched its '90s programming block in response to consumer demand. (A tagline on its website reads: ""Remember when life didn't suck?"") Keith Dawkins, senior vice president and general manager of Nicktoons and TeenNick, recalled that it was about a year or so ago that execs first noticed the longing for programs that emerged in the early-to-mid-'90s such as ""Doug,"" ""Clarissa Explains It All,"" ""Kenan and Kel"" and ""All That."" Today's social media calls for the 1990s . ""We really started to notice digitally on social media sites -- Facebook, Twitter, various video based sites -- that there was this chatter and noise by fans that they wanted their '90s Nickelodeon back,"" Dawkins said. ""There was even a Facebook page that was, 'I want my '90s Nickelodeon back.' "" Coupled with an army of interns in the same age range who could ""put a face"" to the online fans -- which Dawkins said they estimated to be some 15 million strong -- executives at the channel decided to go with it. When the programming block bowed on July 25 at midnight, placed at that time period to indicate that this was for the adults who remembered the shows and not necessarily kids, it was a hit. Ratings for that 12 a.m.-2 a.m. time period, which was on a Monday, were around 500% higher in the 18-34 demographic, according to a statement from the network. When these adults were kids, the expansive cable market we know today was just beginning to grow, and here they were at 7, 8, and 9 years of age with an entire network just for them, Dawkins said. ""This '90s Nickelodeon thing -- it's not just about the shows,"" he concluded. ""It's about the environment, the packaging, and everything that was going on at that time. They view Nickelodeon [of the '90s] as the golden age, because they're so deeply emotionally connected to that time period."" Stars of yesteryear come back for second round . That strong emotional tie could also explain why, as TVGuide.com's Ross points out, some stars of the '90s are getting back into the spotlight. (And then, you also have to acknowledge that it hasn't been quite long enough for them to have fallen that far from our radar in the first place.) In addition to Bialik on CBS' ""Big Bang Theory,"" there's her former ""Blossom"" co-star Joey Lawrence, who has starred on ABC Family's ""Melissa and Joey"" with ""Clarissa Explains It All"" and ""Sabrina, the Teenage Witch"" star Melissa Joan Hart since 2010. James Van Der Beek, he of ""Dawson's Creek"" fame, is expected to appear on ABC's ""Don't Trust the B**** in Apartment 23"" in 2012 in a role that essentially has him playing himself. Even an event such as when Jonathan Taylor Thomas turned 30 this fall can cause the Internet to pause long enough to have a sustained fan-girl swoon, recalling crushes on the ""JTT"" of Tim Allen's '90s sitcom ""Home Improvement."" ""Fans are watching these [shows] because they're also remembering what they were like when they grew up watching them,"" Ross said. The actors themselves are ""sort of playing on that, very successfully."" If it seems odd that we're wistful for that which doesn't feel quite that long ago, recall that: (a) more than 20 years have indeed passed since 1990, and (b) it could be because not a lot has changed. Is nostalgia crimping creativity today? ""Digital technology has made it so much easier to access the past. You can YouTube almost any video, TV clip, or just the sound. It's used almost as an audio library,"" said Simon Reynolds, author of ""Retromania."" ""Young people today know vastly more in terms of the history of music than I would have at their age, because I couldn't access it -- there were limits. Cassettes cost money. Now, you can listen to virtually anything for nothing, if you're willing to download illegally. You can school yourself on the whole history of music on YouTube. ... It's not so much about finding new things, but about finding old things that are new to you. "" Awareness and understanding of history is not a bad thing (far from it), and neither is being able to creatively use prior cultural events to help fuel new creations. But, Reynolds believes, our innovation seems to have comparatively slowed. ""[In] previous decades in pop culture, like the '60s and the '90s, there was a lot of emphasis on the new, on looking forward to the future, on innovation and change,"" he says. ""The '60s was crazy for everything new and breaking tradition, and in the '90s there wasn't that as to the extent of the '60s, but there was information technology and a lot of things that seemed very new. And, they were both periods that were relatively economically prosperous."" But in the past decade, he suggests that forward-thinking view ""seems to have really died away in culture, except with things like phones and personal communication technology. I think that's one of the reasons why people are so obsessed with Steve Jobs, because he was the one bringing the science fiction future into everyday life. "" Although it's arguable that the ""mash-up"" or the ""remix,"" by which one would take references from pop culture of the past and reinterpret it for the present, is the innovation of today, Reynolds isn't buying it. ""So much pop culture has become archived in such an accessible way, you have young people who are nostalgic for things long before they were born,"" he said. ""I think that's a bleak view, if that's the future, that culture will just keep recycling and recycling. Everything will get very familiar, at a certain point. People can do it very creatively, but I think at a certain point, things will seem kind of stale, and people would've seen it all before."" And yet, judging from the positive reaction consumers have had to the culture of their childhood being surfaced once again, having seen it all before seems to be exactly the way we want it.","This year reacquainted us with plenty of '90s hits .

"(CNN) -- Three people have been detained for questioning in Belize in the weekend killing of Gregory Faull, a neighbor of Internet pioneer John McAfee, who was being sought for questioning, police said. The detentions are routine in such investigations, said Raphael Martinez, a spokesman for the National Police in the Central American country. Faull, 52, was found dead with a gunshot wound to the back of the head on Sunday in his home near San Pedro Belize, on the Caribbean island of Ambergris Caye, Martinez said. Faull was killed after four of 11 dogs belonging to McAfee were fatally poisoned, said Wired Magazine Contributing Editor Joshua Davis, who said he had spent more than 100 hours with McAfee in recent months. Faull had frequently complained about the dogs barking, Davis said. ""The dogs were poisoned on Friday night, they died very quickly,"" Davis said. ""Sometime between Saturday night and Sunday morning, Mr. Faull was killed."" Martinez said a person working for McAfee called police Saturday about a poisoned dog; when police arrived at McAfee's residence, they found the dogs had been buried. Martinez said there had been ""some sort of misunderstanding"" before Saturday between McAfee and Faull about the dogs. McAfee, 67, told Davis on Tuesday that he did not kill his neighbor, the reporter said. ""He says that he's had very little contact with Greg over the past three years,"" Davis said. ""They've spoken maybe 50 words total. Nonetheless, there was antagonism there. McAfee admits that."" McAfee told Davis that, when police visited his home on Sunday, he hid from them. ""McAfee saw them coming and he dug a hole in the sand and buried himself in the sand, he says, and he put a cardboard box over his head so he could breathe,"" Davis said. ""He said it was extremely uncomfortable, but he believes that the police will kill him if he turns himself in."" ""My goodness,"" Martinez said when asked about McAfee's reported fear. ""He needs to come in so that we can clear the air. We are law-abiding people here. We follow the laws to the letter. We believe at this point that he has absolutely no fear of being killed by anybody."" McAfee is not a suspect, Martinez said. He is a person police want to talk with ""to clarify the situation, to allay the fears of everybody that perhaps he is indeed involved in the murder of his neighbor,"" whose house is about 300 yards away, Martinez said. Investigators were pursuing multiple leads, he added. On Wednesday, police said they had filed weapons charges against McAfee's bodyguard, William Mulligan, 29, and Mulligan's wife, Stefanie Mulligan, 22. The two are accused of keeping a firearm and ammunition without a license. They were arrested on McAfee's property, police said. In a telephone interview with Davis that was posted on Wired's website, McAfee said Tuesday morning that he was hiding from authorities.

He said a number of the country's political figures were corrupt. McAfee has a history of problems with the government, Davis said. In April, a gang-suppression squad raided one of his properties and charged him with running a methamphetamine lab and illegal arms possession, Davis said. The charges were dropped. ""Ever since then, McAfee thinks he's been harassed by the police,"" Davis said. ""And I directly confronted him on this and I said, 'Maybe you're paranoid.' He talks about police hiding in bushes and stalking."" Davis said he ""wondered if there was something bad that was going to happen."" ""I do agree that he is a very eccentric multi-millionaire and I also felt fear with him,"" he said. McAfee founded the Internet security company that bears his name, but left it in 1994, said company spokeswoman Kimberly Eichorn. McAfee graduated in 1967 with a degree in mathematics from Roanoke College, according to the Virginia school. He went on to found several tech companies and to launch groundbreaking products, including the voice-recognition system Interpath Inc. in 1981, McAfee in 1988, and the instant messaging pioneer Tribal Voice in 1996.

"CHONGQING, China (CNN)  -- At the Chongqing Children's Palace, experts are hoping to revolutionize child-rearing with the help of science. About 30 children aged 3 to 12 years old and their parents are participating in a new program that uses DNA testing to identify genetic gifts and predict the future. For about $880, Chinese parents can sign their kids up for the test and five days of camp. When Director Zhao Mingyou first heard about the technology earlier this year, he instantly knew it could be a success in China. ""Nowadays, competition in the world is about who has the most talent,"" said Zhao. ""We can give Chinese children an effective, scientific plan at an early age."" The test is conducted by the Shanghai Biochip Corporation. Scientists claim a simple saliva swab collects as many as 10,000 cells that enable them to isolate eleven different genes. By taking a closer look at the genetic codes, they say they can extract information about a child's IQ, emotional control, focus, memory, athletic ability and more. ""For basketball, we can test for height and other factors,"" said Dr. Huang Xinhua, a leading scientist on the project. ""We also test listening ability so that can tell us if (the child) might be talented at music."" Would you be happy to test your child? Have your say . DNA testing has been used more widely to determine susceptibility to genetic disease. The test can identify mutations in the genetic code that lead to certain disorders, allow patients to assess risk levels and decide whether they want preventative treatment. For example, the test can identify cancer genes that may make a woman more likely to develop breast or ovarian cancer. Some women have decided to have a mastectomy based on DNA test results and family history. But according to Chinese scientists, this is the first time the test is being offered to children in China to help discover their natural talents. For about $880, Chinese parents can sign their kids up for the test and five days of summer camp in Chongqing, where the children will be evaluated in various settings from sports to art. The scientific results, combined with observations by experts throughout the week, will be used to make recommendations to parents about what their child should pursue.  See photos of the summer camp and testing Â» . Dr. Huang said the testing can even help project careers down the road.   Examining one child's results, he told CNN: ""This child is very thoughtful and focused, so I suggest she go into management."" Clinical psychologist Dr. Rob Blinn said the DNA test can be accurate but only ""within a sort of limited field"" and that results will not be ""dramatic.""   ""You're not going to be able to predict that someone's going to be like the next Einstein. It's more like this person may have an IQ that's maybe 5 or 10 points greater than this other person because of the absence or presence of these particular genes,"" he said. Still, parents are convinced it will help their child. It is no secret that China's one-child policy often produces anxious and ambitious parents with high expectations for their only child. ""China is different from Western countries,"" said Yang Yangqing, the lab's technical director. ""There is only one child in our families so more and more parents focus on their children's education and they want to give them the best education."" Along with parents, the Chinese government is also interested in giving talented children an early start on their careers. Children as young as two are regularly hand-picked by the government to represent China on the international stage. Future gymnasts, musicians, and basketball players are sent to rigorous training camps and specialized sports schools, and sometimes paid a government salary. There has been speculation China's basketball hero, Yao Ming, was born of an arranged marriage between two well-known basketball players, in hopes of bearing an athletic superstar. Yao and his family have denied these reports. In an autobiography, Yao wrote that his parents actually discouraged him from playing the sport. ""My parents never wanted me to become a professional player,"" Yao wrote. ""They wanted a better life for me."" Yao did start playing when he was nine years old. Three years later, he moved into Shanghai's provincial sports academy where he lived and trained full time. ""My parents agreed only because playing basketball in a junior sports school can improve your chance of getting into college; it counts as extra points on the college entrance exam."" Yao's family reportedly received special stipends from the government to purchase extra food. His success story may well be on the minds of parents in Chongqing. ""It's better to develop her talents earlier rather than later,"" Chen Zhongyan said of her four-year-old daughter, who is attending the genetics camp. ""Now we can find when she is young, and raise her based on what her natural gifts are."" Her daughter, Lai Hongni, has already shown a strong aptitude for dancing, while four-year-old twin boys Luo Lianzhao and Dong Liangtong appear to be good at drawing. ""This way we can really understand our kids,"" said the twins' father, Mr. Dong, referring to the program. In the end, are these parents giving their kids a head start or taking a shortcut? Critics of the program said such analysis has frightening implications. ""Kids, especially at younger ages, they need to have fun, they need to enjoy themselves, they need to find meaning in life,"" Dr. Blinn said. ""They need to have rich deep emotional interchange with their families and parents."" ""Whether it's really good for a two- or three-year-old to be sent off to a camp to be genetically tested, you know, and put in this track so early in life, I have some real doubts about whether that's in the child's best interest,"" Blinn added. ""It seems to be more in the parents' best interest."" But Chen Zhongyan said: ""We only have good intentions for (our daughter). We think this will help her."" It is fair to say many of the kids in Chongqing looked like they were having fun, whether they were jumping on ping pong tables, drawing or playing interactive games. ""I want to be the president of China,"" said three-year-old girl, Liu Xiao Liao. ""Then people will be scared of me."" It seems that some of children may have grand ambitions all of their own.","Chinese summer camps DNA tests kids for natural talents .

"(CNN) -- Chances are, there are some people in your life who spend a whole lot of their free time fiddling on the computer, tinkering with their phones in public settings, and yelling at the television when players perform poorly for professional sports teams that they supposedly hate. Yes, fantasy sports has become as much of a pastime as the actual playing of real sports in real life, and a testament to its power is FX's ""The League,"" a half-hour sitcom that follows a group of 30-something males (and one female) as they negotiate their own careers and adulthood by going to any length to sabotage their opponents en route to victory. ""The League"" was created by ""Seinfeld""/""Curb Your Enthusiasm"" vet Jeff Schaffer and his wife, Jackie Marcus Schaffer. Both serve as writers, directors and producers for the show. ""It's not just a sports comedy. If you know nothing about fantasy football, you're still going to laugh your ass off,"" Jackie says. ""The League"" concluded its third season late last month and enjoyed its best numbers to date. Comedy heavyweights such as Seth Rogen, Sarah Silverman, Jeff Goldblum and Will Forte all made guest appearances alongside NFL players Maurice Jones-Drew, Matt FortÃÂ© and Sidney Rice. With the actual playoffs now in full swing, as well as a fourth season for the show slated for next fall, CNN spoke with the Schaffers about the show's success and the subtle differences between a fantasy football joke and a fantasy league joke. CNN: How did the initial pitch for a show about fantasy football go? Jackie: In television, they won't really let you through the door unless you have something of an organizing principle. For us, a fantasy football league is an adult male or co-ed book club. Thirty to forty million people play, and they just don't play -- they're obsessed with it. We like to say the show is a comedy about people who play fantasy football, not a comedy about fantasy football. We were lucky that FX saw that. The fantasy football concept is just an excuse for the characters to behave like villains and babies every week. Jeff: For us, people go ""Oh, my God, how can you do a show about fantasy football?"" But 35 million people playing something is not a niche. CNN: Jeff, you've worked on ""Seinfeld"" and ""Curb Your Enthusiasm."" Now that there's three season of ""The League,"" what's different about the comedic styles? Jeff: ""The League"" is written and produced the same way that ""Curb"" is written and produced. And ""Curb"" was basically written the same way ""Seinfeld"" was. All of it is based on stories and interweaving those in a satisfying half-hour. It may seem a little different, because the problems of Larry David are not necessarily the problems of every man. But Larry, who watches the show and enjoys it, he'd say, ""We should do this"" and I'd say, ""No, we did that on 'The League.'"" Jackie: The dirty little secret is that ""Curb"" and ""Seinfeld"" are much cleaner shows. I'm the one with the dirty sense of humor. CNN: ""The League"" has slowly gained a fanbase of these last years. What's been critical to its success? Jackie: We make our show for about $750,000 per episode, in about three days. All on location, no set. And we have six leads. It's a mad dash to make the show, but FX does not have big marketing budgets for their comedies. We are completely relying on word of mouth. Jeff: What (FX President) John Landgraf said to us: ""We need shows that can make their own noise."" Which is fine, and they leave it up to us to make our own noise. Our fans are very loyal and passionate and funny, and they've seemed to embrace the show like it's their secret. People feel very possessive of it and they want to show you this thing that they love. CNN: You also have this perfect storm, where the season airs during NFL season and fantasy football leagues are in full swing. Jackie: It's a funny show about a shared passion. Jeff: The audience is growing, and we're super-excited for season four. And we're Tebowing that there will be a season five. CNN: The third season seemed to rely less on fantasy football jokes and went into the guys' lives in a broader sense. Jackie: I think what happens when you get to the third season of a show, their lives begin to get fleshed out. For example, since the first season, we've talked about the lure of Andre's sister being this sexual mentor to the guys. As we continue to make those jokes, we decided to make room to meet her. You have the stories that you want to tell, but you also have the deep history and the lure that you want to start parceling out. The hardest thing about making the show is the time. We have 20 minutes and 45 seconds. With Jeff and ""Curb Your Enthusiasm,"" they have the luxury of making it however long they feel like making it. We try to do a lot of fantasy lines and jokes, and some are more heavy than others. Jeff: There may have been less stories about fantasy football-specific stuff, but I thought there were just as many fantasy league stuff. The whole arc of the season is that they've cheated in the draft order. That's not a specific story like the one where Pete's girlfriend won't let him play Michael Vick. We try to make the whole season about the league dynamic.","""The League"" was created by ""Seinfeld"" vet Jeff Schaffer and his wife, Jackie .

"(CNN) -- Without question, the most valuable thing I've ever just found was probably a stray $20 bill. And that makes sense. People don't randomly misplace their FabergÃÂ© eggs in the parking lot of a Denny's. Cracker Barrel, maybe. It's classy up in that joint. That said, I'd like to think that perhaps one day I'll accidentally trip over some insanely valuable hidden treasure in my own backyard that poked through the earth after a heavy summer rain. But the sad truth is that if I stumble past anything out there, it's likely going to be a cartoonishly large pile of dog poop. Which is worth nothing. To date, my Great Dane hasn't eaten any Google stock. Thus, until that glorious moment occurs, it seems my best bet for getting rich quick is to simply wander the beaches of Dorset, England, and hope that I happen upon a huge chunk of whale puke. Seriously, whale puke. You see, a popular trending story this week was about an 8-year-old British schoolboy who found a 600-gram mass of it in the sand that seems to be worth about ÃÂ£40,000. For those of you keeping score in America, that's 1.3 real pounds of hardened hurl valued at $63,000. By comparison, a decent Lexus starts at half that and probably wasn't yakked up by a sperm whale coming home from an all-night bender. ""Dude, I was a complete mess. Allen kept pouring shots down my blowhole."" So why, then, is a giant glob of whale barf worth more than a luxury car? Well, according to the Bournemouth Daily Echo, what the boy found is actually called ambergris, and it's a highly sought-after fixative to prolong the scent of perfume. ""Pardon me, I couldn't help but notice you smell like whale spew. Is that Calvin Klein?"" These days, manufacturers mostly use synthetics. Clearly, the real stuff is hard to find, and the whales just don't party like they used to. (Though, deep sea crime statistics show 'ludes are making a comeback.) Still, there's high demand for actual ambergris, and young Charlie Naysmith is holding on to the mother lode. Even more amazing is the fact that his golden glob of whale heave may have been floating around the sea for decades. After all those years, it literally could've landed anywhere, but it landed right at his very feet. It's just like the old saying: Sometimes, you don't find the whale vomit; the whale vomit finds you. I think that was Whitman. So, now the lucky boy has to figure out what to do with his newfound treasure. As if selling it isn't the one and only option. However, his dad, Alex, says that at the moment, they're just waiting for more information from marine biologists. While I appreciate their shared interest in science, I really can't stress this enough: SELL IT NOW! IT'S WHALE THROW-UP! Look, I'm all for learning, but if you happen to be holding a projectile from the belly of another living thing and somebody wants to give you money for it, you don't ask questions. You ask for cash. And some Purell. The conversation should be rather straightforward: ""Yes. I. Will. Sell. You. This."" Fortunately, the boy does plan to eventually make a profit from his discovery, and he couldn't be sweeter about how he wants to spend it: He'd like to build a house for animals. Though, the article didn't specify whether the word ""house"" refers to some large sprawling ranch or, perhaps, an English Tudor where gorillas and bears and whatever else can run around humping and fighting and breaking things. Think Noah's Ark meets ""Jersey Shore."" ""Please do not feed the Snooki."" Anyway, if you plan to go out searching for whale retch, be prepared to have a bad time. The boy got lucky. You probably won't. And besides, there's plenty of other good stuff from the ocean floor washing up on the beach.

"(CNN) -- A grand jury in Texas declined to indict the driver of a parade float involved in a deadly accident with a train during a November 15 parade, a prosecutor said Wednesday. Four people were killed when the flatbed truck driven by Dale Andrew Hayden was struck by a train during a parade to honor the military. Midland County prosecutor Eric Kalenak said the 12 members of the grand jury decided against indicting Hayden, who last month was cleared by Midland police. Hayden was driving the last flatbed truck in the parade and was crossing the tracks when an eastbound Union Pacific train slammed into the float, killing Marine Corps Chief Warrant Officer 3 Gary Stouffer, 37; Army Sgt. Maj. Lawrence Boivin, 47; Army Sgt. Joshua Michael, 34; and Army Sgt. Maj. William Lubbers, 43. At least 12 other people were injured. The National Transportation Safety Board said in December that the grade-crossing warning system, which consists of a bell, lights and a gate, operated as designed, giving a 20-second warning of the train's arrival. The truck entered the crossing and the gate lowered, tipping over flag stands on the float. The board re-created the accident as part of an investigation. Kevin Glasheen, an attorney who represents the family of one of the soldiers killed and two people who were injured, said his clients feel Hayden is a victim. ""We believe the event was due to the short warning which we believe is cause of the accident,"" Glasheen said Wednesday.

"(CNN) -- For Jo Sharpton, it started so early that she can't quite recall how long ago it was. She does have a specific memory of enjoying the works of J.R.R. Tolkien at age 7. ""I remember that my sister and I saw the Rankin-Bass animated version of 'The Hobbit,' and then had the special deluxe Double LP Edition,"" she said. ""We listened to this dozens, if not hundreds, of times, memorizing every piece of music, every word of dialogue, every special effects sound. At such a young age, I was immune to the bigger picture of Tolkien's world -- it was enough for me to enjoy the kids' story for what it was."" With 75 years of history to draw on, and an official Tolkien Society for 40 of those years, countless fans like Sharpton have begun their journeys with stories like this. In so many ways, Tolkien fandom has become a family affair. Now an adult, Sharpton sees this week's release of ""The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey,"" as a chance for what she calls a ""family reunion."" The retail worker from Atlanta will be joining 50 of her closest friends in Tolkien fandom, all traveling to Pleasant Hill, Kentucky, to see the movie as a group. The town's Shaker Village holds a special place in the hearts of those in her large group, because they have held two gatherings there since 2008. They're called ""A Long Expected Party,"" a term based on the first chapter of ""Fellowship of the Ring."" The Shaker Village, once home to a 19th century religious community, was seen as the perfect stand-in for the Hobbits' Shire from Tolkien's stories. ""We had over a hundred attendees, for three days of music, laughter, love and 'Fellowship,'"" says Sharpton of the first gathering in 2008. ""We thought of ourselves as the anti-(fan) convention -- no hurried crowds, no standing in lines for hours, no cold, lonely hotel rooms."" The lack of amenities was seen as a plus: ""There was very little technology present -- some of the houses and rooms did not even have TV's, Internet was only available in a couple of places, and there was little to any cell phone reception. And no one cared. In fact, it made the magic all the more real. We were in the Shire. We were living in Tolkien's world, if only for a few days. "" They plan to do it all over again in 2014, but this weekend's smaller gathering will be special as well. As at ""A Long Expected Party,"" many of them will attend the movie in costume. ""It is something that most of us have been looking forward to for months."" Sharpton really started to appreciate Tolkien's work in her teen years, and was especially drawn to the character of Eowyn, a hero who dresses as a man in armor to fight in a battle in ""Return of the King."" ""(I admire) her courage, her desperation, her need to love and be loved, her desire for honor and glory 'far above the mean things that crawl upon the Earth,'"" says Sharpton. ""I began to write stories about her as a teen, using her as a character of her future self, having finally found love and honor but always yearning for that little bit more."" Like Sharpton's Eowyn, a particular Tolkien character captured the imagination of Nadine Palmer of San Antonio: Arwen, the elf portrayed by Liv Tyler in Peter Jackson's series of Tolkien films, starting with ""The Lord of the Rings."" She, too, plans to attend ""The Hobbit"" in costume, but she has taken it a step further: Costuming is now her business as well. Jackson's ""Fellowship of the Ring"" captivated her as a teenager in 2001 and she immediately sought out Tolkien's work in the library. But the costumes also stood out to her in a big way. ""I made it a point to learn how to sew costumes due to how gorgeous the costume design was in this film,"" she said. ""I made a costume of Arwen's that was five sizes too big, made from the completely wrong fabrics, and by all accounts was horrible! But I loved it. I was so proud that I did hand-beading on the sleeves and I had grown my hair out to an elven length. And I had elf ears!"" In 2004, she went to Atlanta's Dragon*Con and spent time with a cosplay group called ""Arms of Middle-earth."" That's where she met ""a cute guy dressed as 'behind the scenes Legolas.'"" She and her now-boyfriend work on Celtic Ruins costuming, and, of course, have grand plans for ""The Hobbit"" release. ""I've just completed a nearly screen-accurate Bilbo for a friend who looks, creepily, like Martin Freeman! Handmade down to the buttons."" Costuming isn't the only thing Tolkien fans have in common. It's quite literally a family affair for those who pass down a love of Tolkien stories from generation to generation. There is live-action Tolkien role-playing, where fans re-enact scenes from the book or create new ones. In preparation for the movie, fans are re-reading the book, creating flow charts identifying dwarves versus hobbits, putting on trivia contests, updating their cosplay progress, and that old standby, posting Instagram photos of movie tickets. With ""The Hobbit"" trilogy expected to be another box office behemoth, Tolkien fandom can only grow from here. CNN's Nikki Rau-Baker contributed to this story.","J.R.R.

"(CNN) -- We're fresh out of English-language ballots. How about Japanese instead? That's basically what happened to voters at one precinct in Hawaii after a series of unfortunate events. First, the polling place at Hokulani Elementary School on the island of Oahu ran out of ballots. A two-hour line formed as polling workers tried to shuffle hundreds of people through a single electronic voting machine. Next, according to Mike Kratzke, who was working the election, officials delivered more ballots -- but they were the wrong ones, featuring the wrong local races. ""Everyone stop! The ballots are wrong!"" Kratzke recalls yelling over an angry mob. Finally: A sorta-solution. Kratzke said he passed out Japanese-language ballots to some of the English-speaking voters. By comparing the Japanese ballots with those that included the wrong candidates, he said, the people of Hawaii finally were able to vote. The candidates' names appeared in English, while the rest of the information -- instructions on how to fill out the ballot. race names -- was in a language foreign to most. It's no fault of Kratzke's. In some ways, it's a creative solution. (Hawaii, where everyone is a racial minority, offers voting info in four languages, including Japanese). ""Some people were able to submit their votes for the races they wanted to vote for on these foreign-language ballots,"" he said, ""but it was just a mess, man."" In all, 69 precincts in Hawaii saw ballot shortages on Election Day and 23 of those ran out of ballots entirely, according to the state election office's spokesman. These issues weren't unique to Hawaii. ""We saw lines four or five hours long -- and even longer"" in several states, said Mary Boyle, spokeswoman for Common Cause, a group that advocates for ""open, honest and accountable government."" In Virginia, she said, nine voting machines broke at one precinct, leaving only one to accommodate the masses. None of these mishaps resulted in another hanging chads fiasco, a la Election Day 2000, but that's beside the point. The scariest thing about the long lines and other such headaches is that they discourage people from voting -- now and, potentially, well into the future. At a time when so much energy in this country is spent on trying to prevent voter fraud, we should turn more of our attention to the experience of people who want to vote, play by the rules, and can't because it's simply too difficult. Kratzke told me 200 to 300 people left his precinct on Tuesday without voting because of the long lines and the ballot shortage. It's hard to blame them. In the modern world, as others have argued, who reasonably expects to wait in a line for more than an hour for anything? The one exception is the iPhone, but I doubt even those bleary-eyed, gadget-obsessed people would wait several hours to vote. ""There were older people who had a hard time standing out in the line,"" Kratzke told me. ""We tried to bring chairs to people, but we didn't have enough chairs. There were people hurting -- people 80, 90 years old who were coming in to vote. People with walkers who weren't able to stand that long."" Some precincts in Hawaii that ran out of ballots were those that nonpartisan volunteers like Joe Heaukulani devoted his weekends to canvassing, encouraging people to participate. ""To me, it's kind of sad,"" said Heaukulani, who was a nonvoter into his 30s until a website asked him to make a pledge to vote. ""You put in all this effort to try to get people to turn out (to vote), and then they have this kind of experience."" Those experiences perpetuate low voter turnout in Hawaii, he said. The state had the nation's lowest turnout rate in 2008, making it the focus of CNN's Change the List project. (It's still unclear whether the state finished in 49th or 50th place this year). ""There's no reason why they should have run out of ballots,"" he said. ""I think it's part of that attitude that perpetuates low voter turnout. 'Well, we don't expect most people to vote.' That has to change from the state. Because that goes back to the whole voting experience ... If you want to have more people vote, make it as easy as possible for them to vote. At least have everything there that they need to vote and make sure they have a good time doing it. (Hawaii's elections office) just like totally messed that up."" The state election office doesn't dispute that perspective. ""Our office made errors in the estimates of its allotment of ballots at the polling places in the general election,"" said Rex Quidilla, spokesman for the Hawaii Office of Elections. ""That's the simplest explanation I can give you. It was an error."" Newly drawn voting districts and a miscalculation that only 25% more people would vote in a presidential race than the primary contributed to the error, Quidilla said. There are some obvious solutions here, including bumping up the number of ballots polling places have on hand, as well as investigating what went wrong with backup plans. Quidilla said ballots or electronic voting machines were provided so that everyone who wanted to could still participate in the election, but one polling place, he said, stayed open two hours and 45 minutes late to accommodate people. ""Election Day is not a surprise. It does not sneak up on us,"" said Boyle, from Common Cause. ""You don't wake up one day and say, 'Hey, today we all vote!' It's as simple as better planning."" Better technology could also go a long way. As Boyle pointed out, it's impossible in 2012 to expect millions of voters to all go to the polls within a 24-hour period. States, including Hawaii, should do more to encourage early walk-in voting and, eventually, electronic voting. People in New Jersey who were displaced by Superstorm Sandy were allowed this year to vote by e-mail. That's not ready for prime time nationwide, but we should start investigating those options in a serious way. Finally, a smarter -- or ""modern,"" as Boyle put it -- voter registration system also wouldn't hurt. People in every state should be able to register to vote online, and a national system could make registration automatic when you sign up for other services. A nagging issue in Hawaii, though, still seems to be a lack of confidence in and respect for voters. If the state doesn't provide enough ballots, why would someone stand in line?","23 polling places in Hawaii ran out of ballots .

"Washington (CNN) -- Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor touted the benefits of affirmative action in her personal and professional life, telling CNN in an interview that diversity programs helped open new worlds and made her more determined ""not to fail, to work hard, to succeed."" Her sudden fame as the first Latina member of the high court still surprises her. ""I still get chills sometimes when I walk in into this building and when I enter the courtroom to hear a case,"" she said on Friday. Sotomayor, 58, has a new autobiography out this week, ""My Beloved World."" It is a candid and deeply personal account of her early life. She seeks to inspire by revealing often painful chapters in her self-described ""extraordinary journey."" This includes her father's early death from alcoholism; a complex, often distant relationship with her mother; growing up poor in the Bronx projects; self-doubts about her looks, a brief failed marriage, and her professional path. But her strengths are celebrated, too. Self-reliance to the point of giving herself insulin shots at age 7, after being diagnosed with diabetes; her loyalty to a large circle of friends; and vivid pride in her Puerto Rican heritage. Sotomayor spoke at the Supreme Court with CNN ""Starting Point"" anchor Soledad O'Brien and CNN en Espanol's Juan Carlos Lopez in separate cable-exclusive interviews. Sotomayor was named to the high court in 2009 after 17 years as a federal judge in New York. She will formally swear in Vice President Joe Biden during separate inaugural ceremonies on Sunday and Monday. She told CNN the responsibility was ""surreal."" ""I practice everything I do over and over again, and so I have been saying the oath out loud for a couple of weeks now, a couple of times a day. But I won't be relying on my memory either,"" she said. ""I'll have a card with me. I like having a security blanket."" Chief Justice John Roberts stumbled when he recited the oath of office to President Barack Obama four years ago, without benefit of a card containing the constitutionally mandated words on it. Roberts will do the honors again, at the president's invitation. ""I was thinking just a couple of days ago, if I think back when I was a kid -- which of the two would seem more improbable to me,"" said Sotomayor of sitting on the high court and swearing-in the vice president. ""I realized each one was so farfetched that I couldn't have imagined either."" Her memoir spends a good deal of time discussing being one of the first beneficiaries of affirmative action, when she entered Princeton University in 1972 as one of the few Hispanic and women students at the time. ""It was as if I had landed in a different world,"" she told O'Brien. ""It was so foreign to me you really did feel like an alien."" But she succeeded academically, graduating with top honors. ""You can't help but feel different,"" she said of entering the university and later the legal profession as a minority. ""It makes me sensitive to that, not as a judge, but as a person. Every judge has a different life experience."" The high court is currently deciding whether diversity plans at the University of Texas in Austin unfairly discriminate against white students. She would not talk about that case or any appeal before her. Sotomayor acknowledged that her colleague, Justice Clarence Thomas, takes a different view of his experience as an African-American growing up in the same era. He has spoken of feeling stigmatized, believing many teachers and fellow lawyers were skeptical his accomplishments were earned fairly. He has since questioned the value of his Yale Law School education, the same institution attended by Sotomayor. ""My book talks about the negative aspects"" of feeling discriminated and stigmatized herself, Sotomayor said. Through hard work and her own talents, she was able to succeed through every professional step in life, and the justice felt she could always ""hold my head up high."" Her narrative is also revealing about her personal life, especially the decision not to be a mother. ""I get angry when some people say you are less than a woman because you didn't have children,"" she told CNN. ""The choices of how you manage your life should be your own."" Sotomayor worried becoming pregnant ""could be compromised by my childhood diabetes. I thought I would regret trying to have children."" Sotomayor admits feeling ""overwhelmed, terrified"" sometimes in her role as one of only nine justices, having the final say in important issues like national security and same-sex marriage. So, too, as a role model for millions of young people of all backgrounds. Guiding her is a mixture of self-confidence and quiet anxiety, of ""not wanting to disappoint myself. I set high standards for myself,"" she said. ""I wasn't born a justice, I work at being a justice. I work at how to be an influential voice.""","Interview keys on release of new autobiography, 'My Beloved World'

"Shanghai, China (CNN) -- China's traditional iron-handed approach to the media has taken a surprise turn of tolerance with Beijing's soft handling of a recent dispute with local reporters, in what could well become a more open attitude toward the media under the incoming administration of presumed new President Xi Jinping. The new openness is being driven in large part by pragmatism, as the government realizes that both traditional and newer media can serve as powerful tools for achieving many of its goals in the country's modernization. The recent conflict between reporters at the progressive Southern Weekly and local propaganda officials over a censorship incident left many guessing how the government would respond to the first clash of its kind in China for more than 20 years. The result was a surprisingly mild approach, including mediation by a high-level government official and a vague promise for less censorship in the future. The unusually tolerant tack could well reflect a new attitude by Xi and other incoming leaders set to take control of China for the next decade, all of whom have come to realize the media can serve many important functions beyond its traditional role as a propaganda machine. At the top of Xi's list is the fight against corruption, a problem he has mentioned frequently since taking the helm of the Communist Party last year. The party has tried to tackle the problem for years using its own internal investigations, but progress was slow until recently due to protection many officials received through their own sprawling networks of internal relationships, known locally as guanxi. All that began to change in the last two years with the rapid rise of social media, most notably the Twitter-like microblogs known as Weibo that are now a pervasive part of the Chinese Internet landscape and count hundreds of millions of ordinary Chinese among their users. Those social media have become an important weapon for exposing corruption, allowing thousands of ordinary citizens to pool their resources and build cases against officials they suspect of using their influence for personal gain. This increasingly sophisticated machine was on prominent display last year in a case involving Yang Dacai, a local official in northwestern Shaanxi province who infuriated the online community by smiling at the site of a horrific accident scene. Netizens quickly turned their outrage into an online investigation, and uncovered photos of him wearing several luxury watches he could hardly afford on his government salary. As a result, the government ultimately opened an investigation into the matter and Yang was sacked from his posts. In addition to its role in battling corruption, the media has also emerged as an important tool for combating and addressing many of the other social problems that China is facing in its rapid modernization. Barely a week goes by without a report on the latest national food safety scandal or case of illegal pollution in both traditional and social media, with such reports often followed by government investigations. Beijing leaders have also discovered that the media can also be an important vehicle for improving communication between the government and general public -- something that was a low priority in previous eras when officials only cared about pleasing their higher-up party bosses. Following a Beijing directive in late 2011, most local government agencies and other organizations have all established microblog accounts, which they use to keep the public informed about their latest activities and seek feedback on upcoming plans. Such input has become a valuable way to temper traditional public mistrust toward the government, which historically didn't make much effort to include the public in any of its internal discussions. Lastly, the government has also discovered that media, especially social media, can be an effective tool in gauging public opinion on everything from broader national topics like inflation down to very local issues like land redevelopment. Such feedback was difficult to get in the past due to interference by local officials, who tried to filter out or downplay anything with negative overtones and play things up to their own advantage. As a result, central government officials often received incomplete pictures of what was happening in their own country. With all of these valuable roles to play, the media has become an increasingly important part of Beijing's strategy in executing many of its top priorities. The government also realizes that a certain degree of openness is critical to letting the media perform many of those roles, which may explain its relatively tolerant approach in the recent Southern Weekly conflict. Such tolerance is likely to continue under Xi's administration, helping to shift more power towards a field of increasingly emboldened reporters at both traditional and new media and away from their traditional propaganda masters. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Doug Young.","Young: Handling of Southern Weekly row demonstrated tolerant side of new leadership .

"Amman, Jordan (CNN) -- Thousands of protesters gathered in downtown Amman, Jordan, Friday to demand political change. The demonstration came less than a day after King Abdullah II dissolved the country's parliament and called for early elections close to the new year. The peaceful rally called for constitutional reforms, with protesters complaining that the king has too much power. They demanded that representatives be able to run for election in a democratic system rather than be under his control. ""Whoever (is) corrupted is the enemy of God,"" they chanted, waving Jordanian flags. Read more: On eve of protest, King Abdullah dissolves parliament . Many said Jordan's economy is hurting, and too many people cannot afford the high cost of living and are being burdened by high inflation. Unemployment is too high, they said, and young people especially are without work. The complaints have been echoed for some time in Jordan and gained steam when the Arab Spring began to sweep North Africa and the Middle East in 2010 and 2011. Popular uprisings in Tunisia, Egypt and Libya have ousted longtime leaders from power. Jordanian Foreign Minister Nasser Judeh told CNN that he thought media had exaggerated the number of protesters at the rally, and said an accurate number is about 7,000 to 8,000. ""I think if you compared that to the 2 million people who registered to vote in the late couple months, we can do the math and see that 2 million people are eager to be a part of our democratic reform and new elections,"" he said. ""I think we are heading in the right direction in very, very firm steps."" King Abdullah has made some changes over the past year, but he hasn't done enough, protesters said. ""The king saw this coming and he's been watching the Arab Spring carefully,"" said Elliott Abrams, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations with a specialty in Middle Eastern affairs. ""But it's important to remember that Jordan is much more open than Libya. Here you had 10,000 people demonstrating, and they're allowed to."" Read more: U.N. ambassador Angelina Jolie visits Syrian refugees in Jordan . In the past few years, there has been much more open criticism of the king, he said. ""Five years ago, people might have grumbled in private but not publicly,"" he said. ""There's more criticism of the royal family."" But the king is in what appears to be in a tough spot. If he makes political reforms, that would mean taking power away from his base -- the Bedouin tribes, a group known as the East Bankers. On top of that concern, the king is also dealing with more than 200,000 Syrian refugees who have entered Jordan recently. Read more: Jordan's king calls Syria attack 'a tremendous blow' to al-Assad regime . ""So what you've had this past year or so is the king promises change, but then nothing really happening,"" Abrams said. In nearly two years, King Abdullah has fired four prime ministers. In February 2011, shortly before Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak stepped down following weeks of intense protest, King Abdullah dismissed his government and ordered ""genuine political reform,"" the country's royal court reported. The king promised that the government would ""take practical steps, quick and concrete, to launch a process of genuine political reform"" and ""comprehensive development,"" and would act to strengthen democracy. New prime ministers were appointed in October 2011 and May 2012. Opinion: Syria fighting sparks refugee crisis in Jordan . On Thursday, government spokesman Samih al-Maitah framed the king's latest decision to dissolve parliament as part of his promised reforms. ""This was not a surprise decision,"" al-Maitah said, adding that to ensure fairness, an independent commission will oversee upcoming parliamentary elections. Protesters Friday chanted, ""We came to call for reforms and an amendment to the constitution so the people can see the light!"" The Muslim Brotherhood organized the protest. The religious and political group -- which was started in 1928 and counts Egypt's new president, Mohamed Morsy, as a member -- believes Islam is not simply a religion but a way of life. It advocates a move away from secularism and a return to the rules of the Quran as a basis for healthy families, communities and states. The Brotherhood has repeatedly called for political reform in Jordan. ""No way are we going to accept anymore that one person rules over 6 million people and nobody can ask him about what he does,"" said Nimer al-Assaf, deputy secretary general of the Islamic Action Front, the political arm of the Muslim Brotherhood. It's unclear how much power the Brotherhood has in Jordan. The group has publicly vowed, Abrams said, not to contest the parliamentary elections in the new year. The Muslim Brotherhood in Jordan has been a part of politics for decades, the foreign minister said. He said the majority of those at Friday's protest were members. ""This is not new for Jordan,"" Judeh said, adding that ""certain agendas"" rather than political reform are the Brotherhood's objectives. CNN's Sara Sidner reported from Amman; CNN's Ashley Fantz reported from Atlanta.","Protesters in Amman say they want the king to have less control .

"Washington (CNN) -- Thanks to Sen. Patty Murray, Sharon and Blake Ilstrup can have their big inauguration date night after all. Last week, the Seattle-area couple, along with many others, were shut out of the first-come, first-served official Presidential Inaugural Ball ticket sales when a mistake by Ticketmaster, the ticket vendor, inadvertently released tickets for both the inaugural ball and parade early, as CNN first reported. Ticketmaster and the Presidential Inaugural Ball later apologized for the mix-up, but thousands of potential partygoers were upset and flocked to Facebook and social media demanding a remedy. So the Ilstrups -- who had planned on breaking out their finest formal outfits for Monday night -- found themselves and their two kids headed to Washington with no ball tickets in hand. But after seeing their story on a Seattle TV station Friday morning, Murray, a Democrat from Washington state, came to the rescue. Murray called her office and told them to track the couple down. Obamas party with 30,000 close friends . ""Sen. Murray was touched by how much effort (the Ilstrups) had made to try to go to the ball and felt (terrible) that even though they were online so early an error dashed their hopes,"" Murray spokesman Matt McAlvanah told CNN. ""She told staff that she thought 'their enjoyment was the best use of my tickets.' "" But Sharon Ilstrup said the office had a hard time tracking them down in time since the family had already left for Washington. Finally, just hours before the big event, the office was able to locate her cell phone number and made the connection. The Ilstrups, who planned the almost 2,800-mile trip to Washington as a part of an educational experience for their two children, Alec, 14 and Anna, 11, were touring the National Mall on Sunday when they got the call from Murray's office offering them the tickets. ""We just walked across the street,"" Ilstrup said. The Russell Senate Office Building, where Murray's office is located, is a couple of blocks from the Capitol and a hop, skip and a jump from the Mall. ""They were so excited to give it to us."" Murray's office later tweeted a picture of the happy family. While Alec and Anna won't be attending the ball with their parents, they won't miss out on all of the fun. The whole family will attend the President Barack Obama's second inauguration ceremony on the western front of the U.S. Capitol, with tickets they secured from U.S. Rep. Suzan DelBene, D-Washington. With her gown secured, Sharon Ilstrup, an Obama supporter, said she was most looking forward to the ball for ""the energy."" ""Just being there and the energy of the day ... just to be a part of another celebration of Barack Obama and of our country and not to be in my hotel room packing to go home.""","Seattle couple was shut out of inaugural ball tickets after ticket vendor mix-up .

"(CNN) -- The Hard Rock Cafe franchise, famed for its rock'n'roll memorabilia, is expanding its reach into hotels and casinos -- but its chief executive says the brand will remain ""special."" ""We don't want to be in every street corner, in every city of the UK,"" Hard Rock's Hamish Dodds told CNN. ""We want to have a few very special locations, and keep it special,"" the 55-year-old Scotsman said from his office in Orlando, Florida. The first Hard Rock Cafe opened in London in 1971, and in the 1980s the company expanded globally. It now has more than 175 venues across 53 countries. The franchise is famous for its large music memorabilia collection, consisting of more than 70,000 pieces rotated through its restaurants. Hard Rock's ambition, according to its website, is to provide ""the world's most comprehensive visual history of rock 'n' roll."" Some of the company's musical treasures include Jimi Hendrix's Flying V guitar, John Lennon's handwritten lyrics to ""Help"" and one of Madonna's classic bustiers. The company is now expanding from its cafe base into the hotel and casino market. It already has 10 hotels and six hotels with casino facilities across the U.S., Asia and Latin America -- but is yet to establish a hold in the European market. Breaking into such markets has been extremely time consuming, Dodds said. ""Gaming in particular is an incredibly good business but it's very difficult. It's highly regulated, there are only certain markets you can go to, "" he said. ""It's very difficult in terms of barriers to entry."" Dodds believes there is still scope to expand the cafe business globally -- and he's hoping to add one of the world's biggest cities to the list of cafes. ""You know, I think there are always little parts of our empire that we haven't quite been able to nail ...but Sao Paolo's one that I think I'd like to get in to,"" he said.

"MEXICO CITY, Mexico (CNN) -- Nearly a week after dozens of inmates walked out of a prison in Zacatecas, the central Mexican state's top security official has resigned, state-run media reported Friday. Alejandro Rojas Chalico was the Zacatecas secretary of public security. State-run Notimex reported his resignation, citing the state administration. It was not clear if Gov. Amalia Garcia Medina had accepted Chalico's resignation, Notimex reported. No further details were available. Mexican authorities have been trying to track down the 53 prisoners who left Cieneguillas prison in the city of Zacatecas on Saturday with the help of 20 men. Though the men who raided the prison that morning were armed, they freed the prisoners without firing a shot, according to Medina. The prison break took fewer than five minutes, he said. He believes the inmates are likely connected to the Gulf Cartel, a powerful drug cartel operating in northern Mexico. The news of Chalico's resignation came as the international criminal police organization Interpol issued a security alert for 11 of the men, whom it said Mexican authorities have identified as the ""most dangerous."" The alert, or ""orange notice,"" includes identifying details of each fugitive to help law enforcement officers in their search, Interpol said. It identified the prisoners as: Juan Enrique Almader Becerra, 21; Pablo Banuelos Esponoza, 30; Heriberto Centeno Madrid, 39; Ruben Delgado Gamillo, 28; Santiago Hernandez Naranjo, 36; Daniel Martinez Solis, 22; Joe Reyes Martinez, 33; Juan Antonio Saucedo Diaz, 33; Jesus Maria Soto Calderon, 52; Jose Florentino Soto Estrada, 30; and Erick Jesus Soto Estrada, 25.","Report: Top security officical in Zacatecas state, Mexico, resigns after prison escape .

"(CNN) -- Stratford, in east London, is the gateway to London's 2012 Olympics. And those taking public transport to the Games are likely to wander through Westfield Stratford City. Westfield expects 35 million visitors a year to its Stratford mall, which it opened last September. But with the Games on its doorstep, that figure is getting a huge boost. During the Olympics over 200,000 spectators and workers are expected to walk through its doors. ""In one sense the Games is an interruption to that normal footfall, in another sense it is a massive opportunity in exposing new people to the building who ordinarily would not come here on a regular basis,"" said Steven Lowy, co-chief executive of the Westfield Group. The mall houses more than 250 shops with 70 spots to eat and drink, making it Europe's largest urban shopping center. It opened its doors during the height of the recession but Lowy believes it can withstand the downturn. ""Many parts of the world are suffering lack of consumer confidence, a lack of spending, and countries are doing what they can to manoeuvre through that,"" he said. ""But the UK is a country of more than 60 million people; London is one of the world's greatest cities so we are confident that in time this will work itself out,"" he said. Stephen Lowy is the son of Westfield's founder and chairman Frank Lowy, who fled post-war Europe to set up shop in Sydney in the early 1950s. He floated his now billion dollar retail emporium on the Australian stock market in 1960. Westfield's portfolio is now valued at $57 billion. The company has traditionally focused its business on the English-speaking market -- it has over 100 shopping centers in Australia, New Zealand, UK and the U.S. -- but last year extended its global reach into the fast growing Brazilian market. ""The first developing market that we really entered into was Brazil, and that was last year,"" Lowy said. ""We put a modest but important sum of money there to understand the market and over time I think a company like ours will be able to understand how to operate and be successful in those type of markets,"" he added. For Westfield, location is everything. ""We are looking for cities that are important from a world context, cities that are important in robust economies, and robust political markets that give you some sort of certainty,"" Lowy said. ""There is no certainty in life but you can mitigate the risk by investing in certain locations,"" he added. Cities like London, Milan, New York and Sydney have proven their ability to withstand the shocks of the world's financial crisis, he said. Shopping not only ""makes us all happy and smile,"" it is also a major economic force, Lowy noted. In countries like Australia, America between 50% and 70% of the economies are driven by retail. ""Governments focus on consumer behavior, it is hugely important for any country from an economic perspective, and so we are at the fulcrum of that and we do our best to make sure that our buildings produce enormous economic activity,"" Lowy said.","Westfield's Stratford center opened in September last year .

"(CNN) -- Contactless payments are poised to radically change the landscape for businesses and consumers across Europe, according to the CEO of Visa Europe. Known as ""wave and pay"" or ""tap and go,"" cashless and contactless payments are a way of paying for everyday items like a newspaper or a cup of coffee simply by swiping your card, or increasingly your cell phone, across a reader. The concept is built around saving time for the user, so they don't need to rummage around in pockets or bags for wallets and purses. Peter Ayliffe, CEO of Visa Europe, predicts the fast-paced movement of the technology around cashless payments will overtake more conventional methods in the next decade. ""I've made this prediction that by 2020, more than 50% of our transactions are going to be on mobile phones,"" he said. ""For 50 years we've had the piece of plastic. OK, it's developed, it's been more secure, we've added features to it and everything else, but for 50 years I've carried a piece of plastic around. ""Now, suddenly, I've realized that in the future, I don't have to have that piece of plastic, it's on this wonderful smartphone. So radically that changes your thinking."" Ayliffe says that in future other ways of paying may give way to the phone as the payment method of choice. ""We'll never go cashless, because people will always choose how they want to pay. If they want to pay by cash, if they want to pay by card in the future, that's absolutely fine with me. ""But what we're trying to do, is say: 'There's a much more convenient way to pay.'"" The revolution requires putting in place a whole new set of financial infrastructure at banks and retailers to facilitate the new way to pay. ""We're the enabler,"" said Ayliffe. ""You've got to get every retailer to kind of change their front-end systems so they can accept contactless payment,"" he said. ""You've then got to get every bank to start issuing contactless cards. You've got to work with the mobile-phone operators, and the hand-set providers to really put all that infrastructure in place. ""Nothing in payments happens quickly."" Ayliffe said the changes don't come cheap either. ""It is costly; it is time consuming to get it all in place. But every now and again you see an opportunity that you think: this is such a fantastic opportunity, and we really really must leverage it."" Tough economic times in Europe mean consumers are even more aware of what they are spending, but they are also creating a focus on how money is spent, according to Ayliffe. ""The consumer is being very careful about what they're spending nowadays,"" he said. ""But what's happening, is the consumer is moving away from inefficient forms of payment, like using the check, like using cash, to the much more convenient and efficient ways of paying."" Look out -- the contactless revolution could be coming to a retailer near you.","Contactless payments are the future, says Visa Europe CEO .

"Washington (CNN) -- It's beginning to look a lot like, well, 2011 again, at least at the nation's gas pumps. The national average price of gasoline has dropped to a fraction of a penny under $3.25 a gallon, according to the American Automobile Association. That's the lowest average in almost two years -- welcome news for the estimated 84.4 million Americans planning to hit the roads when the holiday period officially gets underway on Saturday. It wasn't that long ago when motorists could literally stand in front of a gas station sign and see the numbers increasing right before their eyes. This month's prices have been in reverse. The average price of gas has dropped every day in December for a total of 15.4 cents a gallon so far for the month, according to the latest statistics from AAA. That's a 4.5% drop in less than three weeks. Since mid-September, the national average price has declined 62.3 cents a gallon (16%.) When it comes to Christmas travel, money does not always dictate what people decide to do, the travel experts say. ""The year-end holiday season remains the least volatile of all travel holidays as Americans will not let economic conditions or high gas prices dictate if they go home for the holidays or kick off the New Year with a vacation,"" said AAA President and CEO Robert Darbelnet in a recent statement. AAA predicts what people don't spend at gas stations could free up money for more spending on presents, dining and entertainment. Gas prices are expected to drop through the rest of the month and could dip to an average of $3.20 a gallon. The automobile association averages gas prices to a fraction of a penny, and says the national average price came out to $3.248 a gallon. Motorists in Missouri are looking at average prices of $2.955, the lowest in the country, the association says. Hawaii tops off with the highest pump costs at $3.979 a gallon, still better than the $4 per gallon motorists there had been seeing throughout the year.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Who knew what, and when? Some congressional Democrats are calling for an investigation into controversial CIA interrogation techniques. Those questions, focused on recently released Bush-era CIA memos detailing ""enhanced interrogations"" of suspected al Qaeda members -- are now being posed inside the Beltway, as calls by Democrats for an independent investigation into torture allegations have become louder. House Minority Leader John Boehner said Thursday that the release of what he described as the ""torture"" memos is politically motivated. ""Last week, they [Obama administration] released these memos outlining torture techniques. That was clearly a political decision and ignored the advice of their Director of National Intelligence [Dennis Blair] and their CIA director [Leon Panetta],"" Boehner said. The Ohio Republican pointed out that he saw a partial list of the number of members of the House and Senate, Democrats and Republicans ""who were briefed on these interrogation methods and not a word was raised at the time, not one word."" Rep. Peter Hoekstra, R-Michigan, also blasted concerns being raised by Democrats. ""Only now that we have a new administration are people coming out who were aware of these programs saying wait a minute, these were terrible programs. In reality, two, three years ago, they signed off on it, they voted for legislation that funded these programs, and now all of a sudden these are terrible practices,"" he said. But when asked whether or not she raised objections to the interrogation measures at the time, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi -- a then-ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee -- vehemently said ""we were not, I repeat, we were not told that waterboarding or other enhanced methods were used."" ""What they did tell us is that they had some legislative counsel ... but not that they would. And that further, further the point was that if an when they would be used they would brief Congress at that time,"" she added. President Obama has called waterboarding -- which simulates drowning -- torture, and has defended releasing the CIA memos. One memo showed that CIA interrogators used waterboarding at least 266 times on suspected al Qaeda leader Abu Zubaydah and Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the suspected mastermind behind the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on the United States. Earlier this week, Obama left open the possibility of criminal prosecution Tuesday for former Bush administration officials who drew up the legal basis for aggressive interrogation techniques many view as torture. Obama said it will be up to Attorney General Eric Holder to decide whether or not to prosecute the former officials. Prosecutions of CIA interrogators carrying out Justice Department orders would not, however, be prosecuted, according to Obama and Holder. Sen. Jay Rockefeller said he agreed that CIA operatives shouldn't face prosecution, but is ""not prepared to say the same for the senior Bush administration officials who authorized or directed these policies in the first place."" ""The focus for right now should be on finding the facts,"" the West Virginia Democrat added. Sen. Patrick Leahy, the Vermont Democrat who is chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, has said that he wants a commission of inquiry to look into the matter. ""We must take a thorough accounting of what happened, not to move a partisan agenda, but to own up to what was done in the name of national security, and to learn from it,"" he said. But the Senate's top Democrat said Thursday that it's important for both Democrats and Republicans to take a step back and let the appropriate investigation take place. Majority Leader Harry Reid said while he doesn't support an independent ""truth commission"" to look into the affair, he does want the Senate Intelligence Committee to take the lead. ""I think it would be very unwise from my perspective to start having commissions, boards, tribunals until we find out what the facts are. I don't know a better way to get the facts than through the intelligence committee,"" he said. That position puts Reid at odds with Pelosi, who said Thursday that, ""I have always been for a truth commission."" Earlier this week, the Senate Armed Services Committee released a 230-page report detailing interrogation tactics used at the Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq -- and the methods employed at Guantanamo Bay. The report showed that top Bush administration officials gave the CIA approval to use waterboarding, a controversial interrogation technique, as early as 2002. ""These are 230 pages of facts as to how abusive techniques were used, what I consider to be abominable legal opinions were written to justify those techniques,"" Chairman Carl Levin, D-Michigan, told CNN. Read more on the report . Levin now wants the Department of Justice to investigate exactly what happened -- something Obama called for on Tuesday. On Thursday afternoon, Holder told a House committee on the memo prosecution question, ""I will not permit the criminalization of policy differences."" But, he said, ""it is my responsibility as the attorney general to enforce the law. It is my duty to enforce the law. If I see evidence of wrongdoing I will pursue it to the fullest extent of the law and I will do that in an appropriate way."" Other Democrats are calling for criminal inquiries to be held. ""It is the duty of the United States under the law to at least have an investigation,"" Rep. Jerry Nadler, D-New York, said. Democratic leadership sources say, however, that strong GOP resistance makes that a hard sell. Reid insisted that despite calls for investigations and even prosecutions to take place, there is no Democratic divide. ""Justice must be served. Retribution ought not be what were talking about,"" he added. Resistance has begun to show -- coming from a top Senate Republican. Sen. John McCain -- a Vietnam War P.O.W. who was tortured -- has been a vocal opponent of the practice. But on Wednesday, he told reporters that it's important for the country to move forward. ""If we prosecute individuals for providing their best recommendation to the president of the United States, it will have a chilling effect from now on,"" the Arizona Republican said. iReport.com:Share your take on torture . McCain -- along with Sens. Joe Lieberman, I-Connecticut, and Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina -- on Wednesday sent a letter to Obama strongly urging him not to prosecute government officials who provided legal advice related to detainee interrogations. ""Pursuing such prosecutions would, we believe, have serious negative effects on the candor with which officials in any administration provide their best advice, and would take our country in a backward-looking direction at a time when our detainee-related challenges demand that we look forward,"" they said in the letter. The senators' concerns are also being echoed by Obama's defense secretary, who warns of the consequences abroad. Defense Secretary Robert Gates said Thursday that he was is concerned with the ""potential backlash"" in the Middle East and in the war zones. He said the release might have a negative impact on the troops. But Gates said with all the congressional investigations being released and lawsuits, the release of the memos was going to happen. ""There is a certain inevitability that much of this will eventually come out,"" Gates said. ""Pretending that we could hold all this and keep it all a secret, even if we wanted to, I think was probably unrealistic.""

"(CNN) -- On a dark London day in late 2007, just after a violent crackdown on the monk-led anti-government protests that became known as the Saffron Revolution, a prominent scholar told me that ""what Myanmar needs is ordinary people doing ordinary things."" Had he been able to foresee the cache and relevance of the term today, what he might have said is that Myanmar needs the rule of law. More than any other single aspect of society, the ability to do ""ordinary things"" depends on the presence, awareness, acceptance and enforcement of just laws. Exactly five years on, and Myanmar has come a long way -- if not on the rule of law then at least on legal reform. More than 400 laws, old and new, from media and foreign investment to public gatherings, drugs and the environment have been drafted, amended or reviewed. The process and results are far from perfect: The authorities are still reluctant to consult civil society; not all laws reach and reflect international human rights standards; and certain critical areas have been neglected altogether. The Emergency Provisions Act, used for decades to suppress peaceful political dissent; the Electronic Transactions Law, often employed against journalists and bloggers; and the 1982 Citizenship Law, which renders the ethnic minority Rohingya population stateless -- also not an exhaustive listing -- need urgent attention. Yet a positive process is underway. Less talked about is the glass ceiling in Myanmar that is preventing legal reform from becoming full-fledged rule of law: endemic corruption. Last month, Transparency International ranked Myanmar the fifth-worst in (perception of) public sector corruption among 176 countries. The judgment is justified. As dozens of Myanmar nationals representing many segments and sectors of society told me recently, corruption often succeeds where law fails. Public doctors explained to me that while they are ethically (and legally) bound to afford themselves adequate time to give their patients an accurate diagnosis, there is far more money to be made by packing the daily patient list as tightly as possible and offering additional time later to those who can pay. Likewise, public teachers, many of whom teach less than required to the general class while offering the balance as ""advanced"" instruction to students whose parents are able to pay. The legal profession seems no exception. In the words of one lawyer and reflective of many others, it is ""saturated"" with corruption at every level. Lawyers are reduced to the role of ""brokers;"" disproportionate power rests with court clerks who decide for a price the who, what and when of cases; and judges simply wait for an envelope containing either a verdict or cash. Several civil servants asked me in both confession and frustration why they should do their jobs for next to nothing when they can get more by doing it for people who pay them enough to actually make a living. And among the main reasons for the low morale in Myanmar's armed forces is the near-impossibility of career advancement without bribes -- and a disparity in wealth between the soldiers and generals that far exceeds the difference in official pay. The recent and ongoing human rights and humanitarian crisis in Rakhine State is likewise more than just a matter of law. Restrictions on the movement, marriage, employment, health care and education of ethnic minority Rohingyas not only constitute violations of their fundamental rights and freedoms but, for the local and border authorities, are lucrative as well. Any restriction can be lowered or lessened for the right price. Indeed, as many Burmese went to pains to remind me, if ""ordinary things"" are generally associated with the corruption of those in authority, ""ordinary people"" include those who agree to pay the bribes, not complain, even looking for their own opportunities to exchange give for take. Corruption, like clapping, requires two hands to produce the desired result. Legal reform itself has a role to play in breaking through the glass ceiling of corruption toward achieving the rule of law. While last week Myanmar took a notable step in that direction by finally ratifying the U.N. Convention against Corruption, it has not revised its 65-year-old domestic legislation on corruption. It should do so urgently, and as with other laws that obtain international standards, enforce it strictly. December 9 each year is International Anti-Corruption Day. The next day is International Human Rights Day, a coincidence on the calendar, but deeply connected to corruption. Greater promotion and protection of economic, social, and cultural rights in Myanmar would level a heavy blow to corruption via more and better jobs, increased awareness and education, higher salaries and greater public sector ""infrastructure"" -- doctors and hospitals, teachers and schools, lawyers and courts. It is not by accident that the four nations whose public sectors were rated more corrupt than Myanmar's are the Sudan, Afghanistan, North Korea and Somalia; human rights violations, poverty, and corruption mutually enforce one another. Myanmar's legal reform efforts over the past year have been extensive and should continue. But to go beyond the books and actually affect the human rights and economic development of Myanmar's ""ordinary people,"" corruption must be confronted head on. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Benjamin Zawacki.","More than 400 laws, from media to foreign investment, have been drafted, amended or reviewed .

"(CNN) -- The arcane rules governing Thursday's Iowa Democratic caucuses will test even the most organized campaign, but mastery of the process could launch a candidate on a path to the White House. Most Americans are familiar with how elections work -- secret ballots, an 18-year-old age requirement, all-day voting. But that's not how the Iowa Democratic caucuses on Thursday will work. When the Democratic caucuses begin at 7 p.m. CT sharp in school gymnasiums, libraries, churches, farm houses and other locations in the 1,781 precincts across the Hawkeye state, step one will be to stand up and be counted. ""What you'll do is get up out of your seat and you'll go walk to the corner or space by the wall designated for the candidate of your choice,"" Chelsea Waliser, an organizer for Sen. Barack Obama, told potential caucus-goers during a recent Obama rehearsal caucus.  Interactive: A step-by-step look at how the caucuses work Â» . After this first step, party officials will determine if a candidate meets the 15 percent ""threshold"" requirement. Supporters of candidates making up less than 15 percent of the vote in a particular precinct will have the option of making their vote count by voting in the second tally for a ""viable"" candidate -- one who got at least 15 percent of the vote on the first tally. It is particularly interesting to watch what happens between the first and second tallies at the Iowa Democratic caucuses, as viable candidate camps vie for the votes of the unviable. It's one of the few times in American politics where voters directly interact with each other.   Interactive: Learn what 'caucus' and other political jargon mean Â» . During the ""persuasion"" time in between tallies, the precinct captain for the viable candidates sends a person over to each group that failed to meet the threshold to convince them to support their candidate. Once everyone has decided where to vote, a second tally is taken, and the results are then sent to Democratic state party headquarters -- not electronically but via ordinary mail. The Iowa Democratic Party keeps the total vote tally a secret and only releases the percentage of delegates won by each candidate, so it all comes down to how many delegates each precinct has, not the popular vote.  Watch how the delegates will calculated Â» . By comparison, the rules governing the 1,781 Republican caucuses, which are held on the same night as the Democratic caucuses, are pretty simple. The Republican caucuses will use a secret ballot, and, since there is no viability threshold, each vote is simply tallied and the number of votes each candidate gets is reported to party headquarters. The ability of a candidate's supporters to use the persuasion period to win over second-choice voters could be a key factor deciding who comes out on top Thursday night.   ""You hit that floor and work it and try to get them. It's like a fun game,""  Clinton supporter Ed Winfry of Sioux City, Iowa, said last month. Because the rules are so complicated, organization is key. Each campaign needs to get its supporters to the caucus locations by 7:00 p.m. sharp. If they are late, they will not be allowed to vote. And Iowa's unpredictable winter weather could be a factor and dissuade a candidate's supporters from traveling to the caucus sites. Democratic caucus rules also make polling very difficult. Unlike a regular election, when a voter can immediately leave the polling place after he or she casts her ballot, a caucus-goer may have to spend hours caucusing before his or her vote counts. Plus, caucus-goers without a viable group may end up switching their support to a candidate who had been trailing in standard polls. The latest CNN/Opinion Research Corp. poll released Tuesday shows a tight race, with 33 percent of likely Democratic caucus-goers backing Clinton and 31 percent supporting Obama. But taking into account the survey's sampling error of plus or minus 4.5 percentage points in the Democratic race, the race is virtually tied. Former Sen. John Edwards is in third place in the poll at 22 percent. But the final results could diverge greatly from the polling numbers because it is more likely that a person who tells a pollster that he or she is going to attend a caucus may not do so.

"Washington (CNN) -- Carl Eppolito voted for Mitt Romney and doesn't have a job. But he's spending his money to go to Barack Obama's inauguration. So is John Trowell. The recent college grad has been selling his blood plasma for $40 a week to afford the trip. And while Camar Robinson, an eighth-grade English teacher in New York, is in better financial shape, teaching isn't exactly a high-paying job. Still, he saved for the Greyhound bus ticket to get from New York to the nation's capital. They are all 20-somethings who are in Washington for Obama's second inauguration, despite the costs during a shaky economy and their political differences. Each of them feels his voice matters to an administration that will shape the future. ""I believe it is very important for politicians to listen to people our age. We communicate in a much different way than generations past,"" said Eppolito, 28. The number of e-mail blasts from the Obama campaign and the president's social media presence suggest the White House knows that. So do comments from one senator in The Washington Post about why there will be extra temporary cell phone towers during Monday's events. ""Last time around, the sheer number of people ... overloaded the system and many cell phones in the crowd just couldn't get a signal,"" said Sen. Charles Schumer of New York, who chairs the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies, in a statement. ""The inauguration is a once-in-a-lifetime experience ... so we're putting measures in place to make sure people can call, tweet, Facebook and document their experience on smart phones and social media."" Eppolito, an MBA student at Villanova University, said he'll be tweeting about his Washington experience even though his candidate lost. ""The change of heart is not necessarily one of agreement or change in political views, but rather one of support for my president. ... I feel it is terribly important that we come together, unified."" He's been saving for weeks for the trip from Philadelphia. He pulled together $15 for the ticket and hopped the MegaBus from Philadelphia to Washington for the short trip. He suspects most Americans have doubts about Obama's political agenda, but ""respect and support are different than agreement and doubts,"" Eppolito said. As an unemployed student, he is ready for change in the economy. Like Eppolito, Trowell knows the anxiety that comes with trying to save money. His Facebook friends are vocal about the taxes coming out of their paychecks. He's working more hours to make ends meet. He even planned to carpool with his mother and siblings from South Carolina for the big event. He used to direct the money he got from selling blood to his education fund. Since November, he's been setting it aside to get from South Carolina to the inauguration. ""I have to work some magic to get off (work),"" said Trowell, 25. ""It's definitely worth it."" Robinson, thinking about his students in New York, really wants to watch Obama take the oath of office. ""In my experience, presidents are about one of two things: power or people. ... Although I'm young, (Obama) seems to be the first who is genuinely committed to people,"" Robinson said. He tells his students that they are a part of a legacy and requires them to keep up with world events. ""They need to start looking outside of themselves and their country,"" said Robinson, 29. ""They have the power and the voices that can steer this country a certain way."" Robinson, Trowell and Eppolito seem certain about the importance of younger voices in political decisions. ""We are connected. We are instantaneous, and we are the generation of the social media boom,"" Eppolito said. ""We have defined what it means for a cause or message to go viral, and are driven by the ability to do so. For that, politicians should listen closely to the pulse of the next generation ... now.""","One recent college grad sold blood plasma to raise money to attend the inauguration .

"Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama and congressional leaders will discuss the looming fiscal cliff impasse Friday at the White House, aiming for a last-minute deal to stave off automatic tax increases and spending cuts. The 3 p.m. meeting -- which will include Obama, Vice President Joe Biden, House Speaker John Boehner, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell -- will come days before the deadline to reach a deal, and after another day of Republicans and Democrats blaming each other for the stalemate. White House spokeswoman Amy Brundage confirmed the meeting, but did not elaborate. Boehner spokesman Brendan Buck and McConnell spokesman Don Stewart both tried to put the onus on their rival political party -- in the former case urging the Democratic-led Senate to pass a bill approved by the GOP majority in the House, and in the latter asking for a detailed proposal from Obama. Earlier Thursday, McConnell said his side won't ""write a blank check for anything Senate Democrats put forward just because we find ourselves at the edge of the cliff."" While a Senate Democratic leadership member said such details would be forthcoming, two White House officials said Obama will not send a fiscal cliff measure to Congress. Reid, the Nevada Democrat, argued that Republicans undermined a potentially major agreement over the past two years by refusing to compromise on their opposition to higher tax rates for the wealthy. Hours before Friday's meeting was announced, he was doubtful there would be a deal by January 1. ""I don't know, time-wise, how it can happen now,"" Reid said. Democrats, GOP challenge each other to act first . The Consumer Confidence Index sank Thursday amid growing fears the sides won't come together. If they don't, economists have warned it could cause another recession. Fiscal cliff fears jolt consumer confidence . At the least, hopes for an imminent so-called grand bargain that would address chronic federal deficits and debt appeared dashed right now, leaving it to the White House and legislators to work out a less ambitious agreement. The principal dispute continues to be over taxes, specifically the demand by Obama and Democrats to extend most of the tax cuts passed under President George W. Bush while allowing higher rates of the 1990s to return on top income brackets. Obama campaigned for re-election on keeping the current lower tax rates on family income up to $250,000, which he argues would protect 98% of Americans and 97% of small businesses from rates that increase on income above that level. Republicans oppose any kind of increase in tax rates, and Boehner suffered the political indignity last week of offering a compromise -- a $1 million threshold for the higher rates to kick in -- that his GOP colleagues refused to support because it raised taxes and had no chance of passing the Senate. Fiscal cliff a self-inflicted problem . Last Friday, the president proposed the scaled-back agreement that included his call for extending tax cuts on households with incomes under $250,000, as well as an extension of unemployment insurance. McConnell told Obama in a telephone conversation Wednesday that he must see details of a proposal before he can figure out how to proceed on a Senate vote. However, a senior Democratic Senate source said Thursday that McConnell must first work things out with House Speaker John Boehner before Democrats divulge more. Such squabbling has left many doubtful there will be a deal before the fiscal cliff takes effect. Reid criticized Boehner's insistence the Senate act on House measures, saying Democrats and Republicans have to agree on something together. ""We are in the same situation we've been in for a long time,"" Reid said. ""We can't negotiate with ourselves."" Both sides play the 'blame game' Reid said Boehner wants to wait until after the new House re-elects him as speaker early next month before proceeding with a compromise -- one that will need support from both Democrats and Republicans to pass. Boehner is ""more concerned about his speakership than putting the country on firm financial footing,"" Reid claimed. In response, Boehner spokesman Michael Steel said Reid should stop talking and instead take up legislation passed by the House to avert the fiscal cliff. This comes a day after Boehner's leadership team issued a statement saying the Senate must go first -- either by passing or amending the House-passed proposal -- and only then will they act, an assertion Buck repeated Thursday evening. Reid and Democrats reject the GOP proposals, which would extend all tax cuts passed under former President George W. Bush and revamp the spending cuts of the fiscal cliff. They've called them insufficient, shifting too much deficit reduction burden on the middle class. Instead, Reid called on Boehner to allow a vote on a Senate-passed measure to implement Obama's plan to extend tax cuts to the $250,000 threshold. However, McConnell rejected that possibility Thursday, as he sought to focus the debate on revising House-passed measures. One possibility is the fiscal cliff takes effect and taxes go up in January, then Congress steps in to bring tax rates back down for at least some people -- allowing them to say they're lowering taxes, even if taxes for some wealthy people are higher in 2013 than they were in 2012. But retiring Republican Rep. Steve LaTourette of Ohio calls that scenario little more than a political game. ""Nobody is willing to pull the trigger (because) everybody wants to play the blame game,"" LaTourette said. ""This blame game is about to put us over the edge."" Opinion: Art that calls the fiscal cliff's bluff . Polls show most back Obama . Obama and Democrats have leverage, based on the president's re-election last month and Democratic gains in the House and Senate in the new Congress. In addition, polls consistently show majority support for Obama's position on taxes. The Gallup daily tracking poll released Wednesday showed 54% of respondents support Obama's handling of the fiscal cliff talks, compared with 26% who approve of Boehner's performance. ""We believe very strongly a reasonable package can get majorities in both (chambers),"" a senior White House official said. ""The only thing that would prevent it is if Sen. McConnell and Speaker Boehner don't cooperate."" Americans less optimistic of fiscal cliff deal . Anti-tax crusader Grover Norquist has vowed to back primary challenges against Republicans who violate his widely signed pledge not to raise taxes. Even if a deal is reached, he predicts budget showdowns will continue -- every time the government needs more money to operate. ""There the Republicans have a lot of clout because they can say we'll let you run the government for the next month, but you've got to make these reforms,"" he said this week. On Wednesday, Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner told Congress the government would reach its borrowing limit at year's end, but could take steps to create what he called ""headroom"" for two months or so. However, Geithner said uncertainty about the fiscal cliff and deficit negotiations make it hard to predict precisely how long government measures to address the situation will last. Crisis two years in the making . The possibility of a fiscal cliff was set in motion over the past two years as a way to force action on mounting government debt. Now, legislators risk looking politically cynical by seeking to weaken the measures enacted to try to force them to confront tough questions regarding deficit reduction, such as changes to government programs like Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. The two sides seemingly had made progress early last week on forging a $2 trillion deficit reduction deal that included new revenue sought by Obama and spending cuts and entitlement changes desired by Boehner. Obama's latest offer set $400,000 as the income threshold for a tax rate increase, up from his original plan of $250,000. It also had a new formula for the consumer price index -- called chained CPI -- that wraps in new assumptions on consumer habits in response to rising prices, such as seeking cheaper alternatives, and would result in smaller benefit increases. Statistics supplied by opponents say the change would mean Social Security recipients would get $6,000 less in benefits over the first 15 years of chained CPI. Liberal groups have openly challenged the plan, calling it a betrayal of senior citizens who contributed all their lives for their benefits. Boehner appeared to move on increased tax revenue, including higher rates on top income brackets and eliminating deductions and loopholes. But his inability to rally all House Republicans behind his plan last week raised questions about his role and what comes next. Reid and other Senate Democrats say House Republicans must accept that an agreement will require support from legislators in both parties, rather than the GOP majority in the House pushing through a measure on its own. Some House Republicans have said they would join Democrats and support the president's plan in hopes of moving past the volatile issue to focus on spending cuts and entitlement reforms they seek.

"(CNN) -- When I was young, my teachers praised me for being good at math and art, but my father would always tell people, ""You know, John is good at math."" At the time I felt I had to choose between the two -- and with my parents' influence winning over my own, I went to MIT. After many years there, I learned about computers on many levels. In doing so, I saw technology succeeding each year in making everything cheaper, faster, and smaller -- but failing to create any emotional connection or to bring any meaning to our lives. Design has picked up significant momentum with the success of design-led companies like Apple and Airbnb, but the exact meaning of design and how it is applied is often something of a mystery. Educated as a computer scientist, my bias is to believe in what can be quantified, and so I understand how confusing ""getting"" design can be. Qualitatively speaking, however, something designed superbly tends to look and feel better than something designed poorly. Or, said another way: Something designed superbly tends to look and feel ""different"" than something designed poorly. It is whether the difference ""works"" or not that determines good design versus bad design. We encounter design, good and bad, with everything we see, touch, and use. It's invisible to most people because it's everywhere -- much like the proverbial fish that doesn't know where to find water. TED.com: John Maeda on his journey in design . One simple way to become aware of graphic design is to try not to ignore the font, or typeface, being used -- which does a lot more than just make a word readable. A slight change in line weight can make the word ""heavy"" seem ""heavier."" Formal appears more formal when set in italics. And ""far"" does appear a bit far....................away when a little distance gets added into the visual equation. Design is a way of adding enough visual, tactile, spatial, audio, textural or temporal inflection so as to make the ordinary feel different -- with the goal of making that difference a meaningful one. In the early 1990s, my work focused on combining the rigid vocabulary of computer programming with the playful possibilities of art and design. I created a series of interactive works in the C computer language called ""reactive graphics."" TED.com: David Kelley on human-centered design . My intent was to show that the computer could be more than a cold, clinical object; it could do things that delighted us. Though that work is now credited with helping to launch the interactive graphics movement on the Web, at the time it was marginalized by traditional print designers. Yet I believe that taking principles from one domain and applying them to a new context -- in this case mixing traditional visual aesthetics with advanced computation and algorithms -- is where the practice of design tends to make its biggest marks. Today, the relevance of design is expanding far beyond visual aesthetics -- to everything from tackling global issues such as climate change, to making sense of the overwhelming amount of data that surrounds us. Designers have the unique ability to make information, products and experiences both simpler and richer all at once. TED.com: Designing objects that tell stories . Recently I have been thinking that, just as design and technology combined to make the rich creative space that is digital media today, design and technology together will now begin to help leaders navigate their competing priorities, solve complex problems, and nurture fragmented relationships. As organizations shift from neatly ordered hierarchies to chaotic, flattened ""heterarchies,"" where anyone can ""friend the CEO,"" a new generation of tools will be invented that will allow design and technology to enable leaders to make true connections among people and inspire change. Just as design enabled us to have an emotional connection with a piece of glass and aluminum that lives in our pocket, design and technology together will restore some of the humanity in what it means to lead in the 21st century. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of John Maeda.","John Maeda: Something designed superbly looks and feels different .

"San Pedro, Belize (CNN) -- A dead neighbor. Headless dogs. And a millionaire on the run. All set against a backdrop of spectacular tropic beauty. It would be difficult to imagine a more intriguing story than the one unfolding in Belize right now. Police there are seeking to question Internet pioneer John McAfee in the killing of his neighbor, American businessman Gregory Faull. Faull, 52, was found dead with a gunshot wound to the back of the head this month in his home near San Pedro, on the Caribbean island of Ambergris Caye. McAfee, who is not a suspect, has not been seen since. Three people have been detained for questioning in the killing, police have said, and investigators are pursuing multiple leads. CNN was recently granted rare access to McAfee's beachfront property by a former girlfriend, who asked that her real name not be reported. A bizarre visit to John McAfee's pleasure palace in Belize . Identifying herself as ""Francesca,"" she said she'd spoken with McAfee since he disappeared, and that he is ""frightened for his life."" ""He's in constant fear, paranoid,"" she said. ""I would say it's because of what he has been through. ... He thinks people are always after him, which they really are right now."" The former girlfriend said she doesn't know where McAfee is, except that he is not at home. They communicate by phone, ""not often, once a day, or hardly ever,"" she said. On Saturday, McAfee apparently began a personal blog, writing posts about being on the run, the media's portrayal of him and what he calls ""harassment"" by the Belize government. ""I am asking all people of conscience to read this blog ... and see the ugly truth unfolding here,"" reads one post that names six people he says have been detained by police in the case, including friends and household staff. CNN cannot confirm the blog's authenticity. Francesca pointed out buildings as she walked around McAfee's compound, a luxurious sprawl of screened rooms, pathways and an open air pool. Police have searched the home and, according to witnesses, dug up the remains of McAfee's dogs. Faull was killed after four of 11 dogs belonging to McAfee were fatally poisoned, said Wired Magazine Contributing Editor Joshua Davis, who said he had spent more than 100 hours with McAfee in recent months. Faull had frequently complained about the dogs barking, Davis said. Raphael Martinez, a police spokesman, said a person working for McAfee called police about a poisoned dog; when police arrived at McAfee's residence, they found the dogs had been buried. McAfee is thought to have shot them to put them out of their misery. Police took just the dogs' heads, instead of their bodies, witnesses said. Authorities are now awaiting the results of ballistics tests to see whether there is any connection between the bullets in the dogs and the one that killed Faull. McAfee, 67, told Davis last week that he did not kill his neighbor, the reporter said. McAfee founded the Internet security company that bears his name, but left it in 1994. He graduated in 1967 with a degree in mathematics from Roanoke College, according to the Virginia school. He went on to found several tech companies and to launch groundbreaking products, including the voice-recognition system Interpath Inc. in 1981, McAfee in 1988, and the instant messaging pioneer Tribal Voice in 1996. When asked why McAfee doesn't present himself to police for questioning, his former girlfriend said it is because authorities want to kill him. ""It will never be ended until John is dead. That's what I believe, until they kill him,"" she said. ""My goodness,"" Martinez said when asked previously about McAfee's reported fear. ""He needs to come in so that we can clear the air. We are law-abiding people here. We follow the laws to the letter. We believe at this point that he has absolutely no fear of being killed by anybody.""","NEW: McAfee apparently begins blog, with posts on life on the run .

"(CNN) -- British authorities reopened the probe of Amy Winehouse's death Monday, a year after the coroner who ruled the singer died of accidental alcohol poisoning resigned amid questions about her legal credentials. A new coroner's inquest into Winehouse's death will begin on January 8, London's Camden Council announced Monday. Suzanne Greenaway lost her position as assistant deputy coroner, to which she was appointed by her husband, London Coroner Andrew Reid, after it was discovered that she had not been a registered lawyer in the United Kingdom for the requisite five years. Read more: 5 damaging myths about addiction . The Grammy award-winning artist, who had battled with alcohol and drug abuse over several years, was found dead at her north London home July 23, 2011. The original coroner's report concluded it was a ""death by misadventure."" A pathologist told Greenaway's court that alcohol toxicity was the cause of the 27-year-old's death, with her blood-alcohol levels measured at more than five times the legal limit for driving. Testimony at her inquest showed no traces of illegal drugs in Winehouse's system. The pathologist's tests revealed that Winehouse's blood-alcohol level was 416 milligrams per 100 milliliters of blood. The level considered lethal is 350 milligrams per 100 milliliters of blood, and the legal limit to drive in Britain is 80 milligrams of alcohol. The pathologist found no traces of tablets in Winehouse's stomach and said her organs appeared to be normal. A verdict of misadventure means that it is judged to be an accidental death in which no law was broken or criminal negligence involved. The singer's soulful, throaty vocals brought her stardom in 2007, but her troubled off-stage life -- chronicled in her top 10 hit ""Rehab"" -- won her notoriety.

"(CNN) -- International Correspondent Fred Pleitgen reports from the site of E1, a controversial settlement that the Israeli government plans to build. What is E1? I was standing on the barren hilltops East of Jerusalem and it is hard to believe the area could be at the center of an international controversy. E1 stands for East 1 and marks territory that the Israeli government has slated for settlement construction in the West Bank. It's about 12 square kilometers (4.6 square miles), and when completed will touch the outskirts of Jerusalem. The construction in the E1 area would be an expansion of one of the largest Israeli settlements in the West Bank, Ma'ale Adumim, with about 40,000 inhabitants, and would merge it with the greater Jerusalem area. Why has the plan caused so intense international reaction? After the United Nations General Assembly vote on November 29 to grant the Palestinians the status of a non-member observer state in the body, Israel announced settlement construction in the West Bank and East Jerusalem as a response, saying part of that would likely take place in the E1 area. The Palestinians believe construction here would essentially cut the West Bank in half and could also impede access from the West Bank to East Jerusalem, which the Palestinians would like to see as the capital of any future Palestinian State. In an interview with CNN, the Palestinians' chief negotiator Saeb Erekat condemned the plan saying: ""There is no chance for a Palestinian state. I mean it is impossible. Anyone who looks at the map, looks at the geography will know exactly that this decision means that there is no more two-state solution."" How many Israeli settlements are there? According to the settlement monitoring group Peace Now, there are currently 137 Israeli settlements in the West Bank, with about 325,000 inhabitants in total. The settlements are essentially Israeli towns of various sizes in Palestinian territory. Many of them, like Ma'ale Adumim, look almost like any other Israeli town with everything from supermarkets to shopping malls and schools. What is their legal status? The legal status of the settlements is in dispute. The United Nations and many scholars of international law consider them illegal, but Israel and some experts like the late Eugene Rostow of the Yale Law School and Julius Stone, international law professor at the University of Sydney, have said they are legal. The Palestinians want Israel to give up most settlements as part of any future two-state solution, but many believe that is not realistic considering the size of some of them. How do settlements impact the peace process? Settlements are one key reason why there have been no negotiations between the Israelis and Palestinians for several years. The Palestinians say they will only return to the table if Israel freezes all settlement construction, while Benjamin Netanyahu's government wants negotiations without preconditions. The dispute over new construction in the E1 sector is adding fuel to the fire and the U.N. believes it might destroy any chance of a two-state solution for good. How would ordinary Palestinians be affected by E1 development? For average Palestinians in the area, the concerns are immediate. Attala Titi, a taxi driver in the town Eizzaria near Jerusalem, told me he fears additional detours and checkpoints if settlements are constructed in the E1 area. ""If they build this settlement and close off our roads it will mean that my trip from Hebron to Jericho would take between five hours to a whole day."" How about people currently living in the settlement? Ma'ale Adumim's Mayor Benny Kashriel is happy at the prospect of expanding the settlement, a project that has been on hold for years. ""This place, this residential neighborhood, it is in the Ma'ale Adumim municipality, part of Ma'ale Adumim municipality, government land. It has to be built for our young couples,"" he told me from his office.","Israel plans to begin construction of settlements in the East 1, or E1, zone in the West Bank .

"(CNN) -- Lionel Messi's bid to break Gerd Muller's record for goals in a calendar year is back on after the Argentina star was named in Barcelona's squad to travel to Real Betis on Sunday. Messi, who is one short of the German's 1972 milestone mark of 85, has made a quick recovery from the injury he suffered on Wednesday that had football fans around the world so worried. ""He completed training on Saturday without any kind of trouble,"" coach Tito Vilanova said on Barca's website. ""There are still a lot of hours until kickoff and we'll all evaluate the situation together and decide whether he'll play the full 90 minutes or just part of the match. ""The important thing is that he's feeling okay ... But he could easily wake up in the morning and tell us he's feeling pain again."" Mapping Messi's annus mirabilis . Messi injured his knee after coming on as a substitute in the 0-0 Champions League draw with Benfica, prompting fears that he would miss Barcelona's last four games of 2012. ""When I first felt the knock, the pain made me imagine I'd be out for many months,"" he said. However, he announced the following day that the injury was not serious -- and now it appears he is fit to face fifth-placed Betis. ""If he travels it's because he's ready to play. If there was the slightest risk, he wouldn't be going,"" Vilanova said. ""I think Messi was comforted when he found out that it's not a serious injury. If he wants to be in the squad because he's not feeling any trouble, then so much the better for us. ""But he doesn't need to make this kind of effort to show how much he loves this sport."" Barcelona went into the weekend six points clear of Atletico Madrid, who host Deportivo La Coruna earlier on Sunday. Champions Real Madrid closed to within two points of Atletico after coming from behind to beat seventh-placed Valladolid on Saturday. Angolan striker Manucho twice put the home side ahead, but Germany midfielder Mesut Osil scored his second goal of the match with a superb 72nd-minute free-kick that went in off the underside of the crossbar to clinch a vital win for Real. Jose Mourinho brought on Angel Di Maria and Luka Modric in the second half to boost his attacking options, then was able to substitute opening goalscorer Karim Benzema late in the match with Real ahead. Malaga, like Real and Barca through to the last 16 of the Champions League, moved up to fourth on goal difference after a 4-0 win at home to Granada. Joaquin and Javier Saviola scored in the first half, while Ignacio Camacho and Roque Santa Cruz netted late in the second to leave Granada third from bottom. In Italy, veteran striker Francesco Totti scored twice as Roma moved up to fourth place in Serie A with a 3-2 win at home to Fiorentina. Fiorentina could have moved above third-placed Inter Milan, but went 3-1 down as Totti netted his second in first-half injury time. Moroccan striker Mounir El Hamdaoui reduced the deficit immediately after the interval but Totti set up Argentina-born Italy international Pablo Osvaldo for his eighth goal this season to put the capital side above the visitors on goal difference. Atalanta moved up to seventh with a 2-1 win over mid-table Parma, as veteran Argentine striker German Denis netted the opener for his sixth goal in Serie A this campaign. Defender Federico Peluso made it 2-0 before Brazilian Amauri reduced the deficit just before halftime. Valencia beat Osasuna 1-0 in Ernesto Valverde's first game as coach, moving up to 10th in the table thanks to a 55th-minute goal from Spain striker Roberto Soldado.","Lionel Messi named in Barcelona squad for Sunday's La Liga trip to Real Betis .

"Washington (CNN) -- U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton called on Israel to reconsider plans to build thousands of homes in its occupied territory, saying it will set back efforts to bring about a two-state solution between the Israelis and Palestinians. Clinton's comments Friday followed news that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu authorized the construction of the new homes, a move widely viewed as retaliatory after the Palestinians won a United Nations bid to recognize their claim to become a ""non-member observer state."" ""In light of today's announcement, let me reiterate that this administration Ã¢â¬â like previous administrations Ã¢â¬â has been very clear with Israel that these activities set back the cause of a negotiated peace,"" Clinton said in remarks delivered at the Saban Center for Middle East Policy in Washington. Netanyahu has not publicly acknowledged the approval of the new construction. But a senior government official said Saturday that the prime minister signed off on building ""3,000 housing units"" in the East Jerusalem as well as authorizing planning and zoning for future construction in the West Bank town of Ma'ale Adumim. ""This makes operational plans that were on the table,"" said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the subject matter. Clinton did not refer to any specific settlement in her remarks. But the Obama administration has repeatedly warned Israel against settling East Jerusalem and the West Bank, particularly the Ma'ale Adumim area, because it would make it nearly impossible to create a contiguous Palestinian State. Britain also called on Israel to reverse its decision to build housing in the West Bank and East Jerusalem. ""Israeli settlements are illegal under international law and undermine trust between the parties,"" Foreign Secretary William Hague said in a statement. ""If implemented, these plans would alter the situation on the ground on a scale that makes the two state solution, with Jerusalem as a shared capital, increasingly difficult to achieve. They would undermine Israel's international reputation and create doubts about its stated commitment to achieving peace with the Palestinians."" Israel seized the West Bank, Gaza, Golan Heights and Sinai Peninsula during the 1967 war. The Sinai has since been returned to Egypt. Israel annexed the Golan Heights in 1981, a move not recognized by the international community and condemned by Syria, which still claims the land. The more militant Palestinian group Hamas now controls Gaza, while the moderate group Fatah -- headed by President Mahmoud Abbas -- administers the West Bank, site of a growing number of Israeli settlements. Ultimately, the Palestinians are aiming to unite Gaza and the West Bank under the authority of a new state with the capital of East Jerusalem. The United States was opposed to Palestinian efforts to gain recognition by the United Nations as a ""non-member state,"" warning that such a move might cause Israel to react. ""Palestinian leaders need to ask themselves what unilateral action can really accomplish for their people. President Abbas took a step in the wrong direction this week, to say the least. We opposed his resolution,"" Clinton said. ""But we also need to see that the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank still offers the most compelling alternative to rockets and permanent resistance. At a time when religious extremists claim to offer rewards in the hereafter, Israel needs to help those committed to peace to deliver for their people in the here and now."" Palestinian officials have refused to enter into new talks with Israel until it stops building settlements on West Bank land. Netanyahu, meanwhile, has said there can be no preconditions on talks. The Palestinian bid to the United Nations and news of Israeli settlement construction came just days after a cease-fire took hold between Israel and Hamas that brought about an end to a series of Israeli military airstrikes against Gaza launched in an effort to stop Hamas rocket attacks. Clinton called on Egypt to use its ""unique relationship"" with Hamas to make clear it opposes any escalation of tensions. ""We look to Egypt to intensify its efforts to crack down on weapons smuggling from Libya and Sudan into GazaÃ¢â¬âand I am concerned that, if more rockets are allowed to enter Gaza through the tunnels, that will pave the way to more fighting again soon,"" she said. CNN's Bob Kovach reported from Washington, CNN's Chelsea J. Carter from Atlanta and CNN's Michael Schwartz from Jerusalem.","NEW: The UK calls Israeli settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem illegal .

"Frankfurt, Germany (CNN) -- The man who shot and killed two American troops in Germany was a recently radicalized Muslim who seems to have been influenced by local radical Islamist websites, a German official said Thursday. Arid Uka told interrogators that his aim was to kill American troops, said Boris Rhein, interior minister of the German state of Hesse, where the shooting took place. Two U.S. airmen were killed and two others were wounded in the attack Wednesday on a U.S. military bus at Frankfurt Airport, authorities say. The 21-year-old man said he was motivated to carry out the attack after seeing a video on the internet the day before, which he claimed showed American soldiers raping Muslim women, according to a German intelligence official who viewed a record of the suspect's interrogation. The suspect confessed to the shooting, and said that he acted alone with no helpers, the German intelligence official told CNN on Thursday. He was friends on Facebook with several pro-al Qaeda extremists from a group based in Bonn, Germany, that is known to German intelligence officials, according to the official. That included links to an Islamic preacher named Pierre Vogel and someone named Nessery, who was arrested about two months ago in Afghanistan, according to a U.S. official with direct knowledge of the investigation. Current indications are that the suspect radicalized quickly, the German official said. The gunman was a postal worker at the airport, but worked outside the secure area. The U.S. official said that Uka didn't appear to punch into work Wednesday -- having apparently canvassed the area beforehand, helping him get around the extensive uniformed and plain-clothes security that typically patrol the Frankfurt airport. Another U.S. official on Thursday said that Uka was ""not on the radar screen"" of American authorities prior to the attack. The suspect is from the northern town of Mitrovica, Kosovo's interior minister, Bajram Rexhepi, told CNN, citing the U.S. Embassy in Pristina as his source. The U.S. official with knowledge of the probe said Uka was a 1-year-old toddler when he moved to Germany, and that authorities believe Uka's relatives had suffered in the 1990s during the Serb crackdown on ethnic Albanians. He has passports from both Germany and Yugoslavia, the latter of which was issued prior to Kosovo's declaration of independence from Serbia in 2008, Rexhepi said. Uka told interrogators that he lived with his family in high-rise public housing in a poor area of Frankfurt, the German intelligence official said. He said he did not have a friendly relationship with people in the neighborhood and did not interact with others there. He said his father was very strict and harsh with him, according to the official. On Wednesday, he allegedly approached a bus, which was parked outside Terminal 2 and was clearly marked as a U.S. military vehicle, German police said after the shooting. According to a U.S. official, the suspect approached one troop on the curb outside and asked him for a cigarette, only to be rebuffed. He then boarded the vehicle and shot over several rows of backpacks and luggage at troops in the back of the bus. At some point the weapon jammed and the suspect fled, the German official said. He made it into the terminal, where he was taken into custody by German federal police, according to police. The weapon was a 9 mm handgun that was illegally purchased, Rhein said. The bus was occupied by 15 members of the security forces team that was on its way to Ramstein Air Force Base in Germany before deploying to Afghanistan, the spokesman said. One of the dead airmen was a vehicle operator at Ramstein, and the second was part of a security forces team based in the U.K., an Air Force spokesman said. Zachary Cuddeback was one of those killed, his grandfather, Daniel Cuddeback, told CNN. It's not clear if he was the vehicle operator or the member of the security forces team. A statement from his family described Cuddeback as a hockey player and ""Army brat"" with especially strong roots in Missouri in Virginia who joined the Air Force in 2009 after a year at Old Dominion University. The U.S. Defense Department on Thursday identified the other victim as Senior Airman Nicholas J. Alden, 25, of Williamston, South Carolina. He had been assigned to the 48th Security Forces Squadron based out of the Lakenheath air base in Great Britain. The two wounded troops were in a Frankfurt hospital, one in critical condition and the other in serious condition, an Air Force spokesman said. These two were security forces who were on their way to a deployment, said a source, who did not want to be identified because he was not authorized to speak publicly about the incident. U.S. President Barack Obama told reporters Wednesday he was ""saddened and outraged"" by the attack. ""We will spare no effort in learning how this outrageous attack took place,"" he said. German Chancellor Angela Merkel said how upset she was by the incident, expressed her condolences to the troops' families and stressed that Germany will ""do everything we can to try and find out quickly what happened."" FBI agents were on the scene shortly after the shooting occurred, said Tom Fuentes, a former FBI assistant director and CNN contributor. The FBI's main office in Germany is in the capital Berlin, he said, but it has a sub-office in Frankfurt. The offense is a federal crime both in the United States and in Germany, he said, and could be prosecuted in either location, although that will be determined later. However, the investigation will meet U.S. constitutional standards, he said. Authorities will be investigating the suspect's background and associates, likely subpoenaing telephone and e-mail records, Fuentes said. CNN's Ashley Hayes, Barbara Starr, Aaron Cooper and CNN investigative journalist Paul Cruickshank contributed to this report.","NEW: Nicholas Alden, 25, a senior airman from South Carolina, was killed, the military says .

"(CNN) -- Israel said Tuesday it won't bow to demands by world leaders to abandon plans for new settlements on Palestinian territory. ""Israel will continue to stand by its essential interests even in the face of international pressure, and there will be no change in the decision that was taken,"" the Israeli prime minister's office said Tuesday. The decision, which a senior Israeli official in the prime minister's office said was in response to last week's United Nations' vote elevating the U.N. status of the Palestinian Authority, has drawn international ire and concern that it could complicate efforts to restart peace talks. Israel plans to build 3,000 housing units in East Jerusalem and the West Bank, many of them in the large West Bank settlement of Ma'ale Adumim. Long-term plans call for the eventual construction of 5,000 units in the area. Palestinian leaders object, saying the settlements are illegal and would slice the West Bank in two and cut it off from the proposed Palestinian capitol of East Jerusalem. Israel has not yet formally acknowledged the plans. Read more: Clinton: New Israeli settlements a 'set back' for peace . Australia and Egypt on Tuesday joined five European countries that have summoned Israel's ambassador to hear criticism of the decision. Australian diplomats expressed ""grave concern"" over the plan, the Foreign Ministry said in a statement. Foreign Minister Bob Carr, traveling in New Guinea, said the decision would make peace negotiations more difficult. ""I am extremely disappointed with these reported Israeli decisions,"" he said. Egyptian Foreign Minister Mohamed Kamel Amr told Israeli Ambassador Yaakov Amitai that his government's decision ""does not comply with the principle of land versus peace that is the basis of the peace negotiations in the region,"" the Foreign Ministry said. Britain, Denmark, France, Spain and Sweden have also summoned Israeli ambassadors for similar discussions, which are frequently used to publicly demonstrate a nation's displeasure with another country's actions. The British Foreign Office called Israel's move ""deplorable"" and said it threatens a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The foreign ministries of France, Spain and Denmark issued similar statements asking Israeli officials to reverse their decision. British Minister for the Middle East Alistair Burt said he met with Israeli Ambassador Daniel Taub on Monday, calling for Israel to heed calls ""to avoid reacting to the U.N. General Assembly resolution in a way that undermines the Palestinian Authority or a return to talks."" Read more: Abbas calls for Palestinian unity after 'birth certificate' for Palestinian state . The Palestinian Authority also blasted Israel's decision Tuesday as a provocation that flies in the face of international will. ""A clear message must be sent to Israel that all of its illegal policies must be ceased or that it will be held accountable and will have to bear the consequences of its violations and obstruction of peace efforts,"" Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas wrote in a letter to U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. The United States has said it is opposed to Israel's decision, but has not taken the step of summoning its ambassador to say so. ""We urge Israeli leaders to reconsider these unilateral decisions and exercise restraint, as these actions are counterproductive and make it harder to resume direct negotiations to achieve a two-state solution,"" White House spokesman Jay Carney said Monday. Read more: Israel plans new homes in East Jerusalem, West Bank . The Israeli Cabinet, in a unanimous vote Sunday, rejected the U.N. General Assembly's decision on Palestinian status, saying it changes nothing and will not be a basis for negotiations. In an e-mail statement to reporters Tuesday, the prime minister's office said that the U.N. decision was a ""one-sided move"" and said ""Israel is not sitting with her hands tied."" Also on Tuesday, Israel demolished a mosque in the village of Farqqa in the Hebron region of the West Bank and attempted to tear down the East Jerusalem home of a Palestinian family. The mosque, which was previously torn down in 2011 because it lacked proper permits, was demolished again Tuesday as the result of a court case brought by Regavim, a pro-settler organization. The group said the mosque had been built illegally and was blocking construction in the Jewish settlement of Abigail. The building was not a mosque but ""a building that was used for prayer"" and was demolished according to a court order, said Guy Inbar, a spokesman for the Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories which is part of the Israeli Defense Ministry. ""The case has no connection to the political developments and should not be connected to them in any way,"" he said. ""It was a court decision."" Village council head Suliman Addra deplored Israel's action. ""My message to the free world is to stop the Israelis from committing crimes against religious sites and to help in rebuilding the mosque,"" Addra said. In the East Jerusalem incident, municipal workers and Israeli border police began work to demolish the home, saying it lacks proper permits, before the homeowner was able to get a court order stopping the work. ""They destroyed all the internal furniture and electronics of the house and attacked my wife and handcuffed me, and held my children. It was done in a vicious way,"" homeowner Tareq Ghaith said.

"Cairo (CNN) -- Egyptian journalists Tawfiq Okasha and Islam Afifi will be tried for defaming and insulting President Mohamed Morsy, a spokesman said Monday. Okasha, who owns the al-Faraeen TV channel and is also a show host, faces the charge of defamation and is accused of ""inciting to kill"" the president, according to Adel Saeed, spokesman for the general prosecutor's office. Afifi, who is editor of the al-Dustour newspaper, was referred to the court for ""spreading false information and rumors that threaten the security and stability of the nation"" and for insulting Morsy, the spokesman said. Analysis: Is Morsy a step forward or back? A date was not immediately announced for the trial, which will be watched closely by those looking for signs of what the future of press freedom will be under the new president, who took office in June. The two journalists were summoned to the prosecutor's office for questioning, but neither appeared, according to the spokesman. Afifi, speaking by phone to 25TV, said he had not been summoned. Over the weekend, prosecutors imposed a travel ban on the two journalists, prohibiting them from leaving Egypt while they are under investigation, Saeed said. Egyptian forces raid Sinai militants . Authorities have already moved to limit the output of their outlets. They ordered copies of al-Dustour to be seized and suspended Okasha's show for a month, the spokesman said. One analyst agreed the journalists ""crossed the line."" ""There is a difference between critique and defaming someone's reputation, like he did with the president and many groups,"" Sawfat Allam, a professor of political media at Cairo University and head of a committee monitoring media coverage of elections, said about Okasha. In one show, the TV host ""insulted"" the Muslim Brotherhood 58 times, Allam said. Morsy, who ran as a candidate of the Islamist organization, resigned after winning the presidential election. Tricky game of power . Okasha has organized demonstrations outside the U.S. Embassy in Cairo to protest what he describes as American meddling in internal affairs. He also protested U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's visit there last month. Okasha is planning a demonstration on August 24 outside the presidential palace to demand that Morsy step down and that the rule of the Muslim Brotherhood be ended. He has said the president ""must be stopped."" News of the upcoming trial came one day after Morsy shook up the country's powerful military leadership, replacing top generals and reasserting power the military claimed for itself before he took office.","Tawfiq Okasha owns the al-Faraeen TV channel and is a host .

"(CNN) -- There are years of shockers. There are years of groundbreakers. And then there are years of ""meh."" 2012 was one big stream of meh. ""Meh,"" as defined by The New York Times Magazine (which features a weekly ""Meh List""), describes ""all those things in life that exist at the top of the fat middle of the bell curve of taste."" They don't inspire wonder or excitement. They don't arouse fury or contempt. As the Times puts it, they're ""not hot. Not not. Just meh."" So consider 2012. Lindsay Lohan allegedly drunk, in a car accident, arrested? Whatever. ""Call Me Maybe"" and all of its YouTube parodies? Next. ""The Dark Knight Rises""? It was OK. 2012: Highs and lows of women in Hollywood . It was the kind of year in which buzz faded quickly -- if it ever started at all. Not even Justin Bieber could shake things up. (See? You yawned when I mentioned ""Justin Bieber."") Pop culture is being made, remade, remixed, rebooted and churned up so fast that, sometimes, the only reaction is a slightly exasperated, seen-it-all-before sigh. There were exceptions, of course. Jennifer Lawrence blossomed into a major star with her performances in ""The Hunger Games"" and ""Silver Linings Playbook""; the fact that she describes herself as ""just really boring"" bodes well for her career (as an actress, not a tabloid staple). Comedy Central's dynamic duo -- Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert -- seldom missed when skewering the hypocrisies of an over-the-top election campaign. Moreover, a number of the year's deaths caused us to catch our breath, including the tragic passings of such notables as Whitney Houston, Levon Helm and Dick Clark. Usually, though, events went by with the weight of a breeze. ""Gangnam Style"" was fun the first million or so times you saw it; by the time its YouTube counter passed 100 million, it was time to ask Psy, what more do you have? One Direction is packing them in, but so did the Jonas Brothers, New Kids on the Block and the Bay City Rollers. Honey Boo Boo may be a sign of the reality TV apocalypse, but there's a new one of those every six months. Sure, it's the nature of pop culture. Once Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton ruled the planet; now they're the subject of a much-mocked TV movie. Still, it's striking how little from the entertainment world's 2012 will likely be remembered in a year or two. Before long, the year will be the subject of one of those History Channel specials, sandwiched between a Hitler documentary and ""Ax Men."" And then we'll glance up, grab the remote and say, ""Meh. What else is on?""","Year's entertainment events seldom stood out .
Many seemed to repeat themselves: Lindsay Lohan's issues, new boy bands .

"(CNN) -- Kimberly Bratic hauled her gear up Afghan mountains. She went into areas where Taliban lived. She grieved when fellow soldiers were blown up by a suicide bomber. She missed her family for a year, and heard the worry in her sons' voices when she got the rare chance to call home. She lay awake, thinking, ""What if I don't make it home?"" The only difference between the 39-year-old single mom and the men she went on 70 missions with was their job titles. U.S. lifts ban on women in combat . The guys were combat infantry. She was a public affairs specialist, the person who documented their experience training Afghan military and police. ""I don't think the enemy would really know the difference if he decided to shoot,"" she wrote in a CNN iReport. On Thursday, Defense Secretary Leon Panetta announced that the Pentagon was doing a 180 on its long-standing policy against putting women in combat roles. The branches have until mid-May to come up with a plan to implement the historic and controversial change in the next couple years. ""Mr. Panetta's decision is just unchecking a box,"" Bratic told CNN. ""Because we're already out there and just as likely to get shot up."" She understands that men and women have different strengths and many women won't be able to endure the physical demands of training for combat positions. Former troops say time has come for women in combat units . But she's worked with several women, including female Afghan soldiers, who definitely could. ""They want it? Give them the chance to go for it,"" she said. That is all the sergeant wanted when she enlisted two and a half years ago. Despite having a master's degree in operations management and a bachelor's degree in human resource management, Bratic was struggling to find a job in northwest Ohio. Rent was due, the bills were piling up and she had three sons to feed. Then one evening a friend off-handedly said that she should think about the Army. With her education, she could likely enlist as an officer, he told her. ""I thought, 'No way, not me,"" Bratic recalled. ""But I went online and started reading all these articles and blogs about Uncle Sam wants you."" She looked up what she might potentially earn -- $3,000 a month, including hazard pay in a war zone. ""It started making sense,"" she said. But convincing herself wasn't really the problem. Letting mom go to Afghanistan . Bratic was the kind of mother who always talked reality with her sons, then 9, 10 and 18. They hated that their mother was often gone, juggling a couple low-paying part-time jobs, including being an adjunct professor. ""They knew I was trying to pay bills,"" she said. ""It was hard for them. They just wanted me to come home and have family time and I just couldn't."" So she sat them down and together they looked at the websites of the National Guard and the Navy. They just played around a bit, watched the slick videos that look so cool. She told them what she wanted to do. ""My oldest, who was starting to think about taking care of himself, understood it,"" Bratic said. ""But the two little ones, they were worried. My middle one had the hardest time. He was the most fearful."" The 10-year-old, Cresston, watched the news. He knew what it meant when Americans in uniform went to Iraq and Afghanistan. By the numbers: Women in the U.S. military . But what could he do? What could the brothers really say? Mom was going to do what she felt she had to. And if she went away, even if it was a long time, maybe afterward she would have money and they could spend more time together. Bratic called her ex-husband. The boys' father didn't like the idea, but he was a good dad. He agreed to care for them while she was gone. Being in a foreign country at war is frightening. Being afraid you could die is haunting. But being away from your children in that environment is uniquely anguishing. ""That mom side of you ... I couldn't look at Afghan kids. I just shut it off. You'll tear yourself up thinking about your kids,"" she said. ""Your head has to be in the mission."" She was definitely focused. In the span of six months, she went on 70 missions, assigned to the 37th Infantry Brigade Combat Team. She worked closely with Brig. Gen. Abdul Habib Sayed Khail. It was the infantry's job to help train Afghan troops so that they can secure Afghanistan when the United States draws down its troops. Bratic said her role was not only to photograph what was happening but also to serve as a mentor the Afghans, including female American and Afghan police and service members. She also mentored Lt. Abdul Mohammed, her male Afghan public affairs counterpart. ""I felt like there was a lot of respect for me,"" she said. ""I was older and that probably helped. But I respected them. I was a guest in their country, and my guys, the group I was with, established up front that I was to be respected."" But Bratic was constantly aware and alert, knowing about the increasing problem of ""green-on-blue"" attacks in which Afghans have turned their guns on their U.S. trainers and fellow Afghan soldiers. She neither played up nor played down her gender. ""The Army is 14% female so I'm already outnumbered,"" she said. ""You just don't think about the guys you're around as eye candy or potential husbands. But you still take care of yourself. I put my hair back every day. I wore Chapstick because my lips would get so dry. And I put eyeliner on because I look deadly without eyeliner."" A uniformed woman in Taliban country . Bratic recalls a favorite mission in Khawajah Bahawuddin in the northeastern region of Badakhshan. The area had not seen NATO forces for years, and no women. ""The potential for disaster was high. We had intel that Taliban were in the area. I had no idea how the people there would react. When we got there, everybody was eyeballing me. I was the woman, the oddity."" The plan was to be there for a while. Gen. Habib took them to a shrine to Ahmad Shah Massoud. A key political and military leader in the Afghans' fight against the Russians in the 1980s, Massoud is a national hero in Afghanistan. If he had not been assassinated on September 9, 2001, some believe he would have gone on to find Osama bin Laden and help the United States and its allies in a way that no one else could. While she stood there, holding her camera, Habib told her how Massoud was killed. His attackers pretended to be journalists doing an interview. Their camera was a bomb. Bratic thinks about that day when people ask her why she went to Afghanistan. It started out as a way to make money, but it became about more. She is like every soldier, regardless of gender, who is changed by a war and hopes that their families get that. When she returned to Ohio, her boys ran to her. They embraced their mom. Her son Cresston, though, needs her attention right now. He doesn't want her to leave again, and she opted to be inactive for now, with the Army Reserve. But she wants to go back badly. Unlike many of the younger soldiers who served with her who banked their earnings, she had to constantly send money back home to pay the bills. She's afloat for now, living again in Ohio. She spends some of her time blogging about her military experience at Afghanbattlefox.com. But mostly she's sending out resumes and making phone calls. She's still had no luck finding a job.","An unemployed single mom with bills to pay decides to enlist in the Army .

"(CNN) -- Doctors in Havana, Cuba, completed a six-hour surgical procedure on Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, Vice President Nicolas Maduro said Tuesday evening in a televised address. The state-run Venezuelan Television's website said in a headline, ""The operation was a success."" Maduro thanked Venezuelans who had prayed ""that this operation would culminate correctly and in a successful manner."" Afterward, Chavez was taken to his room to begin his post-operative recovery, which will last several days, Maduro said. During the operation, surgeons removed a lesion that had appeared in the same place as previous lesions, Maduro said from the presidential palace in Venezuela. ""There were complex moments but, fortunately, this giant -- our commander -- again shows us his strength,"" Maduro said. Chavez was surrounded by relatives and friends, he added. Chavez is ""absolutely confident that he will overcome the obstacles that have come up on the path of his life,"" Information Minister Ernesto Villegas said earlier in the day. Ecuadorian President Rafael Correa -- an ally of Chavez -- had said the surgery would be ""a very delicate operation."" On Saturday, Chavez announced that his cancer had returned and said he needed the new round of surgery. Read more: Venezuela's Chavez arrives in Cuba for cancer surgery . The president has repeatedly spoken publicly about his cancer battle but has never specified what type of cancer it is. And his government has released few specifics, fueling widespread speculation about Chavez's health and political future. Chavez had surgery in 2011 to remove a cancerous tumor and has undergone further surgery and radiation in Cuba since. He declared himself cancer-free in July. Health rumors dogged Chavez on the campaign trail this year but didn't stop him from winning re-election in October. Over the weekend, Chavez said he wanted Maduro to replace him if ""something were to happen that would incapacitate me."" Venezuela's constitution specifies that when a president dies, the vice president assumes the presidency until new elections can be held. Chavez called for voters to take things a step further. ""My firm opinion, as clear as the full moon -- irrevocable, absolute, total -- is ... that you elect Nicolas Maduro as president,"" Chavez said, waving a copy of the Venezuelan constitution as he spoke. ""I ask this of you from my heart. He is one of the young leaders with the greatest ability to continue, if I cannot."" It was the first time Chavez -- who looms larger than life in Venezuela and in Latin American politics-- had spoken publicly about the possibility of a successor. Fast facts: The life of Hugo Chavez . ""This is huge. He could have said something indirectly. He could have said something like, 'We'll have to see. Let's talk about it when the time comes,'"" said Javier Corrales, a professor of political science at Amherst College in Massachusetts. ""He switched from being very evasive to very articulate. That must have been the result of a major change in health for the worse."" In a report published Tuesday, one expert on the region said some observers think that Chavez's health problems are being used for political purposes. ""One speculative theory holds that Chavez's health problems have been serious but not life-threatening -- trumped up to focus attention on him, generate sympathy during this year's election campaign, and now may even be a way of boosting Venezuela's bond sales,"" wrote Stephen Johnson, director of the Americas program at the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies. Keeping the focus on the Venezuelan president could also be a political advantage going into gubernatorial elections, which are scheduled for Sunday, Johnson said. But other signs point to more serious health problems, he said, including a decrease in Chavez's public appearances in recent months. ""Reports may or may not be true since there is no independent, reliable information source other than the president, who decides what he wants to divulge,"" Johnson said.","NEW: state-run media says the operation is a success .

"Istanbul (CNN) -- An organization that monitors freedom of the press is harshly critical of the government of Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan in a new report, accusing it of waging ""one of the world's biggest crackdowns on press freedoms in history."" The New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists concludes 76 Turkish journalists are in prison, ""at least 61 in direct relation to their work."" ""Turkey's imprisonments surpass the next most-repressive nations, including Iran, Eritrea, and China,"" the watchdog group adds in the report published Monday. Read more: Turkey arrests journalists in alleged terror plot . The Turkish government has routinely defended its record by arguing that journalists have not been imprisoned for crimes related to their writing and reporting. ""Of all the people imprisoned in our country, the great majority of those who are tried to be linked with journalist identity are the ones who are deprived of their liberty on the grounds of serious offences such as membership of an armed terrorist organization, kidnapping, possession of (an) unregistered firearm and (a) hazardous substance, bombing and murder,"" wrote Justice Ministry Sadullah Ergin, in a July 10 letter that was published in an appendix to the committee's report. Read more: Turkish journalists detained in Syria released . But this is not the first time international journalist-freedoms organizations have criticized Turkey. The Paris-based group Reporters Without Borders ranked Turkey 148 out of 179 countries -- below Russia and the Democratic Republic of Congo -- on its press freedoms index for 2011-2012. According to the Committee to Protect Journalists, 70% of the journalists imprisoned in Turkey are ethnic Kurds ""charged with aiding terrorism by covering the views and activities of the banned Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK."" The PKK has been waging a guerrilla war against the Turkish state since the early 1980s. More than 30,000 people, most of them ethnic Kurds, have been killed in the conflict. In recent months, PKK-related violence has spiked to levels unseen in Turkey in more than a decade. According to Turkish justice ministry statistics cited by a recent International Crisis Group report on the Kurdish conflict, more than 7,000 people have been detained recently on suspicion of having ties to a ""terrorist organization."" Read more: Turkish journalists missing in Syria finally phone home . In a February 2012 letter written from prison published in the committee's report, Hamdiye Ciftci of the pro-Kurdish Dicle News Agency claimed she was arrested for publishing images of police allegedly breaking the arm of a 14-year-old Kurdish boy participating in an anti-government protest. ""If you don't work for the system covering orderly pieces of news, they try to bend you to their will with pressure and intimidation. And if this does not work, you will end up in prison,"" Ciftci wrote. She was eventually released last April, after spending nearly two years in prison awaiting trial. According to the committee, at least 20 other media workers associated with Dicle News Agency are still in prison and ""jailed in direct connection to their work."" The watchdog group also specifically singled out Erdogan, accusing the tough-talking prime minister of creating a climate of self-censorship in Turkey after nearly a decade in power. ""Erdogan has publicly deprecated journalists, urged media outlets to discipline or fire critical staff members, and filed numerous high-profile defamation lawsuits,"" the report says. Read more: Turkey remembers murdered journalist . The report highlights the case of TV anchorwoman Nuray Mert. ""My TV program was abruptly taken off the air after Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan targeted me in his election campaign speech in the city of Konya in May 2011,"" Mert wrote, in a letter printed by the committee. She credited Erdogan's Justice and Development Party with removing ""the hegemony of the military,"" which has overthrown at least four governments in the past 50 years. But she also accused Erdogan's government of generating ""authoritarian policies in milder forms and under different brands."" Those sentiments were echoed by journalist Ahmet Sik. An early supporter of legal investigations into an alleged terrorist network of ultranationalists with the aim of militarily overthrowing Erdogan's government, Sik is currently being tried for writing a book allegedly at the behest of the same organization. His book, an expose of the infiltration of the police department by adherents of a particular brand of Islam, was banned and police raided newspaper offices to collect copies of it. Sik was released last March after being detained for more than a year, but the court case against him is ongoing and the journalists he was arrested alongside of are still in jail. In a phone interview with CNN on Monday, Sik said his arrest was meant ""to send the message: If we can arrest even these people, then we can definitely come after you."" Erdogan defended his record in a CNN interview broadcast last month. He was asked by Christiane Amanpour, who is also a member of the Committee to Protect Journalists' board of directors, whether it is off limits in Turkey to criticize the prime minister. ""For the last 10 years, I have been fighting against criticism in very harsh terms,"" Erdogan responded, speaking through an interpreter. ""I've been very patient, but I was not patient from time to time, and I had to actually file a lawsuit against those critics. But after a while, I withdrew my applications and I gave up on my rights, let's say. But insult is one thing; criticism is another thing. I will never put up with insult. But I will always say yes and put up with criticism."" Last July, Erdogan's government passed an amendment that reduced penalties some journalists face for their work. ""This new legal feature would effectively serve as an amnesty for press-related offenses and would affect a significant number of cases concerning journalists in Turkey,"" wrote Namik Tan, Turkey's ambassador to the United States, in a letter to the Committee to Protect Journalists. But the amendment did nothing to change Turkey's much-criticized anti-terrorism law, which has been invoked repeatedly to prosecute critics of the government. ""The big mental block in Turkey, unfortunately, is the extraordinary breadth of the terrorist definition: It goes far beyond what anyone in the European Union would say is terrorism,"" said Hugh Pope, senior Turkey analyst with the international Crisis Group, a non-profit conflict mediation organization. ""It is very out of date and prosecutors are using it, apparently, with a free pass from the ruling party, who could change the law if they wanted."" Sik, the investigative reporter facing charges of participating in a plot to overthrow the government, believes that press freedom in Turkey is not possible until the anti-terror statutes are thrown out completely and the criminal code is brought fully in line with that of the European Union. For now, Sik said, ""journalists have two options: either go to jail or overlook injustices in the interest of self-preservation.""","The Committee to Protect Journalists blasts Turkey's prime minister .

"(CNN) -- In Guatemala, and other Latin American countries, it's called ""aguinaldo"" -- the term used for the bonus government and private sector workers receive this time of the year, their right by law. The aguinaldo is equivalent to one month's salary. In other words, workers who are eligible for this benefit get twice as much money in December as they do during each of the other 11 months of the year. The problem is that criminal extortion gangs know this and are increasingly demanding their share of this Christmas bonus. Frequent victims include city bus drivers who also get their aguinaldo. For them, extortion gangs become the Grinch who steals Christmas, and the choice they give bus drivers is harsh: either pay up or we will kill you. Jorge Garcia, a representative for the City Bus Owners Association in Guatemala City, said the extortion attempts even go beyond Christmas. ""The gangs demand a Christmas bonus. They also demand a summer bonus. Around Easter, they also want a bonus for leisure travel,"" Garcia told CNN. According to the Bus Owners Association, so far this year 87 bus drivers have been murdered by criminal gangs, who extort drivers in exchange for safe passage on specific routes. Drivers who refuse to pay face deadly consequences. Authorities say riders who take buses to go shopping are also likely to be robbed. Victims include workers who also receive their Christmas bonus. The criminals know this and board the buses with the intention of robbing them or stealing Christmas gifts they have just bought for their families. Edgar Guerra, president of the Guatemala City and Regional Bus Riders Association, said the trend is alarming. ""So far this year, when you count robberies and direct attacks, there have been 44 riders of mass transit murdered and 78 injured in these kind of violent incidents,"" Guerra said. Violence in Guatemala is nothing new. The Central American nation lived endured a civil war between 1960 and 1996 that left as many as 200,000 people killed or missing, according to some estimates. More recently, members of criminal gangs who were deported from the United States and criminals associated with Mexican drug cartels have terrorized the country. In an international travel alert published last month, the U.S. Department of State said that in Guatemala ""violent crime is a serious concern due to endemic poverty, an abundance of weapons, a legacy of societal violence, and weak law enforcement and judicial systems."" This wave of crime affects many other people who are not necessarily directly victimized by the criminal gangs. Every time a bus driver is killed, Guerra says, up to a quarter of a million riders are affected due to cancellations in service. Guatemalan authorities say they're taking these developments seriously, arresting many of the gangs behind the extortion schemes. ElÃÂ­as Pumay, an investigator with the Guatemalan Interior Ministry who specializes in solving extortion cases, says so far this year they have put 24 criminal gangs out of business with the arrest of 250 suspects. In his investigations, Pumay has noticed a puzzling new trend: ""Interestingly enough, in this type of crime 80% of the perpetrators are women. It's a phenomenon that we're paying close attention to."" Pumay believes those women are following orders from, and acting as messengers for, male gang leaders who have already been arrested and are extorting people from behind bars -- transforming a season of joy into a time of sorrow for their victims.","In Guatemala, many workers receive double pay in December .

"(CNN) -- For weeks, John McAfee hid from authorities, donning a disguise and using disposable cell phones to communicate. On Tuesday, the 67-year-old Internet security pioneer emerged publicly in Guatemala's capital, hundreds of miles away from the Caribbean island in Belize where his next-door neighbor was found dead. McAfee's lawyer said he left Belize to escape police persecution and planned to file a formal request for asylum with Guatemalan officials Wednesday. ""He had to come here because it was the closest and the most immediate place to protect his life,"" attorney Telesforo Guerra told CNN en EspaÃÂ±ol. McAfee's arrival in Guatemala was the latest twist in an investigation that has drawn international attention and prompted the well known software company founder to go into hiding for weeks. Belize authorities have said they only want to talk to McAfee about the November 11 shooting death of Gregory Faull, 52, an American businessman who was found dead in his home on the Caribbean island of Ambergris Caye. McAfee, who is not a suspect in the case, lived next door. ""I had nothing to do with his death,"" McAfee wrote on his website Tuesday in a message to Faull's family. ""I have lost five close family members in my 67 years and I know your suffering."" A Belize police spokesman said authorities there believe McAfee could still be in their country, and they still want to question him in his neighbor's killing. McAfee, who founded the computer security software company that still bears his name, said in a blog post Tuesday that he would speak to Belizean police on the phone and offered to meet with the Central American nation's prime minister ""in a neutral country."" ""If I am indeed merely wanted for questioning,"" he wrote, ""this should suffice."" A Guatemalan official said late Tuesday that officials there had not received a request for asylum from McAfee and did not know how he came into the country. There is no registry of McAfee entering legally at any official border crossing, said Marco Tulio Chicas Sosa, director of international bilateral relations for Guatemala's foreign ministry. ""Everything we know about this case comes from the media,"" he said. The Guatemalan official said he could not comment on whether his country would offer asylum to McAfee, since no request had been filed. Earlier Tuesday, a Belize police spokesman said authorities thought McAfee was still in that country, but declined to say why. ""We're not even sure he's left Belize,"" said Raphael Martinez, spokesman for the Belize Police Department. ""He said a lot of things. The police feel he's still here in Belize. ""It's difficult to pinpoint what he will say next or what he will do next. I still question his frame of mind,"" Martinez said. ""I think the best thing is for him to come in and answer a couple of questions."" Belize won't seek extradition of McAfee, Martinez said. Authorities aren't unfairly persecuting McAfee, and his attorney ""should come to Belize and see what's happening here,"" Martinez said. In an exclusive interview with CNN earlier this week, McAfee said he fears authorities in Belize and said he'd been afraid for his life ever since he refused to pay a bribe to a politician months earlier. Martinez said the interview showed McAfee was trying to use media, especially international outlets, ""as pawns in his game for sympathy."" ""I think he really wants to make this into a great fiasco,"" he said. ""He's really gone out of his way to make the country look bad, and we just believe he should, if he's innocent as he's saying he is, he should bring in his lawyer, and let's get to the bottom of this and say what he needs to say and let's move on,"" Martinez said. ""I'm sure he could be somebody who could direct the course of this investigation."" On his website, McAfee said he has hired Guerra ""to assist in my fight against the government of Belize"" and apologized for the secrecy surrounding his relocation. He did not provide details about how -- or when -- he arrived in Guatemala. ""It was not easy to exit Belize and required many supporters in many countries,"" he wrote. He said he planned to meet with Guatemalan officials and hoped to speak to reporters in a news conference Wednesday. McAfee founded his namesake computer security software in 1987, initially running it out of his home in California. He sold his stake in McAfee Associates in 1994 and moved to Belize in 2008. The case began to unfold on November 9, when McAfee told police someone had poisoned four of his dogs. To put them out of their misery, he shot each in the head and buried them on his property, a former girlfriend said. Officials say the dogs' barking and aggressive behavior was a frequent source of friction between McAfee and Faull, a contractor who retired to Belize from Florida and lived next door. McAfee lived in the remote northern part of Ambergris Caye. Two days later, someone shot Faull in the head in his own living room. A 9 mm shell was found on the second step on the first floor, and Faull was found dead on the second floor. McAfee told CNN in the interview that he did not kill Faull and did not pay anybody to kill the man. He said he will not surrender to police for questioning, adding that his priority is to clear his name. Three people have been detained for questioning in the killing, police have said, and investigators are pursuing multiple leads. A 2009 story in the New York Times indicated that McAfee's fortune had plunged to $4 million from its $100 million peak, largely because of the real estate and stock market crashes that hit his investments. In February 2010, he started QuorumEx, which says on its website to be trying to ""reinvent the way modern medicine combats and disarms pathogenic bacteria.""

"(CNN) -- He began his career as a bus driver in Caracas, then rose through the ranks to become a member of Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez's inner circle. Now, if Chavez's health worsens, Vice President Nicolas Maduro could be the one to take the reins. Chavez, who is battling cancer, said Saturday that Maduro should replace him ""if something were to happen that would incapacitate me."" ""My firm opinion, as clear as the full moon -- irrevocable, absolute, total -- is ... that you elect Nicolas Maduro as president,"" Chavez said, waving a copy of the Venezuelan Constitution as he spoke. ""I ask this of you from my heart. He is one of the young leaders with the greatest ability to continue, if I cannot."" The televised address marked the first time the Venezuelan president specified whom he wants to be his successor. Maduro, 50, has long been a high-profile face in Chavez's administration. He is often seen in the front row of Chavez's press conferences and has traveled to Cuba as the Venezuelan leader undergoes cancer treatment. Read more: Venezuelan lawmakers debate Chavez's trip to Cuba for cancer surgery . ""He is without a doubt one the ministers who is closest to Chavez,"" political analyst German Campos told CNN en EspaÃÂ±ol after Chavez tapped Maduro as vice president in October. Maduro is also Venezuela's foreign minister, a position he's held since 2006. In that role, Maduro has been the South American country's top diplomat as tensions rose with the United States and ties grew with Cuba. ""The U.S. Department of the Treasury is trying to become a sort of world police agency to describe decent citizens of our country ... as drug traffickers,"" Maduro said in 2011, after the department added four Venezuelan officials to its drug kingpin list. ""A country like that has no moral authority to judge generals and political officials in Venezuela,"" Maduro said. ""We reject it and we believe that the drug trafficking mafias are there, in a sick society like the United States."" After security screeners detained him at New York's John F. Kennedy Airport in 2006, Maduro called the U.S. government ""racist"" and ""Nazi"" and said the United States does not appreciate Latin American countries. There are two sides to Maduro, said Javier Corrales, a professor of political science at Amherst College in Massachusetts. ""On the one hand, he has been behind some of the most radical, crazy foreign policy decisions of the Chavez administration. Support for Libya, you name it, all the radical decisions, he has been behind them,"" Corrales said. ""But he also has been behind some of the most pragmatic and conciliatory decisions, including the turnaround in relations with Colombia."" That's a marked contrast with the inflammatory Chavez, who rarely turns to compromise, Corrales said. Before his role representing Venezuela abroad, Maduro honed his political skills at home. He became a union leader while working for the Caracas metro system. After Chavez came to power in 1999, Maduro participated in an assembly that drafted a new constitution. He served as a congressman until 2006, when he was tapped as foreign minister. If the president dies, Venezuela's constitution specifies that the vice president assumes the presidency until new elections can be held. But analysts have said it's difficult to determine who would succeed Chavez, whose personal charisma and popularity have led to throngs of followers who call themselves ""Chavistas."" ""You have to ask what's held things together in Venezuela. ... Part of what's held it together is that Chavez, despite his government's problems, is somebody who has a tremendous emotional connection and charisma with a lot of Venezuelans,"" said Michael Shifter, president of the Washington-based Inter-American Dialogue think tank. ""All of the people who are potential successors of Chavez are people who are polarizing and confrontational,"" Shifter told CNN earlier this year. ""They're loyal to Chavez, but they don't have Chavez's ability to connect with most Venezuelans."" Polls have indicated that although Chavez still has strong backing from his supporters, other possible successors don't seem to generate that kind of enthusiasm. A February poll by the Datanalisis firm showed Maduro with 9.8% support among militant members of Chavez's United Socialist Party of Venezuela. But that was before Chavez's remarks supporting Maduro on Saturday, which will likely bolster support for the vice president within the government and among fervent Chavistas, Corrales said. ""When popular presidents make an endorsement, that always has an effect,"" Corrales said. ""This is an important thing that Chavez needed to do."" When he named Maduro as vice president in October, Chavez noted his extensive experience on ""different battlefronts."" ""The bourgeoisie make fun of Nicolas Maduro because he was a bus driver,"" Chavez said, ""and look where he's going now."" CNN's Patrick Oppmann, Mariano Castillo and Arthur Brice and journalist Osmary Hernandez contributed to this report.","NEW: Analyst: Nicolas Maduro was behind radical foreign policy decisions, but also compromises .

"(CNN) -- At least 17 people were killed when inmates tried to escape from a prison in northern Mexico Tuesday, firing guns at guard towers and running through tunnels below the facility. The dead included 11 inmates and six guards, Durango state public safety officials said in a statement. The violence broke out around 5 p.m. Tuesday at a prison in the city of Gomez Palacio when prisoners began to riot and opened fire, officials said. ""The inmates started to shoot with firearms toward the guard towers and the guard areas,"" the statement said. Officials said the clashes occurred as guards worked to stop a ""massive prison break."" Guards fired shots in the air to try to contain the riot, officials said, then ""exchanged gunfire"" when there was no response. Military troops stopped the attempted prison break, and authorities were investigating to determine who was responsible, the statement said. Violence has been repeatedly reported at the prison where Tuesday's clashes occurred. In a fight at the prison last year, 11 inmates were killed. In July 2010, Mexico's attorney general's office alleged that inmates from the prison were let out to kill rival drug gang members.

"Guatemala City (CNN) -- Four poisoned dogs. A dead neighbor. A millionaire on the run. Come Thursday, deportation may be the latest twist to the saga of software mogul John McAfee. McAfee , who was on the run for weeks to evade questioning in his neighbor's death, was detained in Guatemala on Wednesday after entering the country illegally, officials there said. He may be sent back to Belize on Thursday so officials there can question him, said Francisco Cuevas, a spokesman for Guatemala's president. For those following the tale of McAfee, the man who amassed a fortune by running and then selling an antivirus software company named after him, this new twist should come as no surprise. His arrival in Guatemala is the latest scene in a true story that reads like a Hollywood tale. The case began to unfold on November 9, when McAfee told police someone had poisoned four of his dogs. To put them out of their misery, he shot each in the head and buried them on his property, a former girlfriend said. Officials say the dogs' barking and aggressive behavior was a frequent source of friction between McAfee and his neighbor, American businessman Gregory Faull. Then Faull turned up dead -- two days after the poisoning -- with a gunshot wound to the head. He was in his own living room. A 9 mm shell was found on the second step on the first floor, and Faull was found dead on the second floor of the home in a remote area of Belize. Authorities in Belize have wanted to question McAfee about the death. He refused and then went into hiding. Three people have been detained for questioning in the killing, police have said, and investigators are pursuing multiple leads. ""I had nothing to do with his death,"" McAfee wrote on his website Tuesday in a message to Faull's family. ""I have lost five close family members in my 67 years and I know your suffering."" Though being in hiding, the Internet tycoon has kept an active online presence. He also granted an interview to CNN last week to explain why he did not want to talk to police. He said he feared for his life. He said authorities wanted to persecute him for his refusal to pay a bribe. ""I will certainly not turn myself in, and I will certainly not quit fighting. I will not stop my blog,"" he said. His blog and accusations seemed to anger and baffle authorities in Belize. ""He's really gone out of his way to make the country look bad, and we just believe he should, if he's innocent as he's saying he is, he should bring in his lawyer, and let's get to the bottom of this and say what he needs to say and let's move on,"" Raphael Martinez, a spokesman for the Belize Police Department, said this week. Then McAfee turned up in neighboring Guatemala on Wednesday, to the surprise of authorities there. That same day, the country's foreign minister said he did not know how McAfee got there. There was no registry of McAfee entering legally at any official border crossing, Foreign Minister Harold Caballeros told reporters. His lawyer, Telesforo Guerra, filed a formal request for asylum with Guatemalan officials Wednesday. But by Wednesday night McAfee, was detained and his asylum request was ""suspended,"" said the presidential spokesman. ""Any citizen of any country must be expelled if they enter Guatemala illegally. This is what has occurred at this time. Because of this, he is in the custody of immigration, so they can conclude the administrative process, and then he will be expelled from the country,"" Cuevas said. It was unclear what the next move would be in this saga that has now become an international news story. But it seems the next chapter will be written right where this all started. Belize.

"(CNN) -- If Joseph Kony wasn't the most wanted man in the world, he may be now. In the past week, a documentary detailing accusations of vile acts committed by the Ugandan warlord has spread like wildfire on social media (at the time of writing it has had more than 50 million views), prompting international outrage and a groundswell of support for his capture. In the documentary, ""Kony 2012,"" which was posted online by the U.S.-based group Invisible Children, the tales of atrocities are horrifying: armed supporters force abducted children to kill their own parents, brutal mutilations include the hacking off of lips and limbs, and the sexual slavery of young girls stolen from their families. The group says its aim is to raise awareness and bring Kony to justice. While some critics question whether the film captures the full scope of the conflict, one matter is without debate: Kony now ranks as one of the International Criminal Court's most wanted men, facing arrest on charges of crimes against humanity after a 26-year campaign of brutality in his failed bid to overthrow the Ugandan government. How did Kony rise to power? Kony, a former altar boy, was a young man in his early 20s when he was caught in the storm of violence that marked the final years of Milton Obote's presidency. Obote was deposed in a military coup in 1985, and soon after Yoweri Museveni's National Resistance Army (NRA) seized power. Kony's Lord's Resistance Army was among those who rose up against Museveni's NRA. Kony was a spiritual leader, known as a healer among the Acholi people. He inherited a powerful support base from Alice Lakwena, a spirit-medium. Lakwena's followers would ""daub themselves in shea butter crosses which they believed would protect them from bullets and they believed that stones would explode like grenades,"" explains Matthew Green, author of ""The Wizard of the Nile - The Hunt for Africa's Most Wanted,"" about Kony. ""It was a mystical rebellion,"" Green says, adding that Kony ""was very much an inheritor of her mantle."" Lakwena fled to Kenya after Museveni's forces launched a brutal attack on her and her followers. Staying in northern Uganda, Kony rallied Lakwena's remaining supporters and recruited more with a powerful mix of mythical claims, charisma and unconscionable violence. What is Kony like? Green describes being one of the few journalists to ever meet Kony when the rebel leader briefly emerged from his jungle hideout in 2006. ""Although he was surrounded by phalanxes of child soldiers with Kalashnikov rifles and bayonets fixed to them, he actually looked terrified of meeting strangers,"" Green said. Despite Kony's apparent fear and paranoia, Green says the rebel leader was charismatic and clearly a ""very powerful orator"" when speaking to his people. ""He had an almost musical voice as he spoke in his Acholi language and you could see that the people listening were completely captivated."" What are Kony's tactics? If Kony attracted supporters through his ""mystical powers"" and charisma, he kept them through fear. ""Certainly the violence is what made his movement so terrifying,"" Green says. ""These attacks were carried out often with machetes or clubs and the violence was designed with a very clear political purpose. It was designed to illustrate to the people in northern Uganda that the government of President Museveni could not protect them."" Kony's forces are believed to have abducted thousands of children to join his cause -- however the exact number is unconfirmed. At the height of the violence during the mid-2000s, parents tried to protect their children from harm by sending them to sleep in towns, away from Kony's ruthless kidnappers. Brutal punishments were inflicted on those who were accused of disloyalty by an increasingly paranoid leader, Green says. ""Kony once gave an order that anyone caught riding a bicycle should have their legs cut off. Bicycles were a very common means of transport in rural areas and he was worried that informers, if they saw the rebels, would rapidly pedal away and alert the nearest army post."" And similarly he would cut off people's hands as a kind of warning not to raise any hands against the rebels,"" Green adds. How organized is the Lord's Resistance Army? Kony created the Lord's Resistance Army with the intention to lead, based on his version of the Ten Commandments. Since then it has grown into a ""disciplined fighting force,"" says Green, explaining that its members occupy a rank and are rewarded for loyalty. Kony has been able to maintain his hold over them with his mix of self-proclaimed spiritual powers and military strategy, Ned Dalby, Central Africa researcher with the International Crisis Group, said in a 2011 interview with CNN. ""He cultivates this image of himself as a medium for the power of the spirit and at other times, he presents himself as a ruthless military leader. So he's able to maintain cohesion as a group and maintain the loyalty of his fighters,"" Dalby said. He noted that some former LRA fighters from northern Uganda have given clues as to why some outside the group stayed loyal to Kony. ""They expressed the feeling that because they were given a rank, they were given a certain purpose, and respect and authority,"" Dalby says. ""And then, once they're outside the LRA, they find they've become just another poor person, trying to survive."" Where is Kony now? ""Kony fled back into Sudan probably in late 2005, 2006 and he has not been back into Uganda since, as far as we know,"" Green said. He is believed to be accompanied by a small band of supporters, though his followers are still said to be terrorizing people elsewhere on the continent. ""The mass abduction of Ugandan children and the terrible atrocities, the massacres that Kony committed have not occurred for some years now,"" added Green. ""However, his forces are still on the loose in places like Central African Republic and Eastern Congo, and they still retain the capacity to kill large numbers of civilians. So although they're not a threat to Uganda now, they certainly are a threat to the region."" The U.S. has listed the LRA as a terrorist group and in October, Washington authorized up to 100 U.S. Special Operations trainers and military advisers to assist African forces searching for Kony and other leaders of the LRA. The activities of the group are tracked on a website that uses information from the Invisible Children's Early Warning Radio Network, U.N. agencies and local NGOs to map and document recent crimes.","Documentary detailing vile acts allegedly committed by Ugandan warlord gets 50M hits .

"(CNN) -- The man is nothing if not mercurial. John McAfee, the American tech mogul fighting deportation to Belize, where authorities want to question him about the killing of a neighbor, said late Sunday that he wants to return to the United States. He spoke to reporters via a Ustream video from an immigration detention center in Guatemala City. McAfee emerged in that capital to ask for asylum last week, after weeks of living in hiding. His bid was rejected, but a Guatemalan judge granted a stay of deportation. ""Our intent is to return to America, if at all possible, and settle down to whatever normal life we can settle down to under the circumstances,"" said McAfee. ""There is no hope for my life if I am ever returned to Belize."" Authorities in Belize want to talk to the 67-year-old Internet security founder about the November 11 killing of his neighbor, American businessman Gregory Faull. McAfee said he had nothing to do with the death and insists he left Belize to escape police persecution. He was taken into custody in Guatemala on accusations of entering the country illegally. ""Let me be clear: I had absolutely nothing to do with the murder,"" McAfee said. He told reporters he ""barely knew the man,"" and that they had exchanged maybe 50 words over five years. ""I believed then, and I believe even stronger now that the intent to question me has nothing to do with Mr. Faull's murder,"" said McAfee. He also explained why he was taken to a police hospital last week, the same day his asylum bid was rejected. ""At 67 years old, well, your health is not the best no matter what. However, it is improving. The problem I had the other day is I did not eat for two days, I drank very little liquids and for the first time in many years, I've been smoking almost nonstop. I stood up, passed out, hit my head on the wall, came to in total confusion,"" he said. ""I am fine now."" His legal team initially said he was treated for cardiovascular problems, though his attorney later said McAfee suffered a nervous breakdown and that tests had shown he did not have heart issues. Sunday's developments are just the latest in a story that reads like a bestselling mystery, complete with murder, poisoned dogs and international intrigue. McAfee founded his computer security software company, McAfee Associates, in 1987, initially running it from his home in California. Seven years later, he sold his stake in the company. He moved to Belize in 2008. On November 9, he told police someone poisoned four of his dogs. To put them out of their misery, he shot each in the head and buried them on his property, a former girlfriend said. The dogs' barking and aggressive behavior had been a source of friction between the neighbors. Two days after the dogs were poisoned, Faull's body was found, fatally shot in the head. ""He's really gone out of his way to make the country look bad,"" Belize police spokesman Raphael Martinez has said about McAfee. ""We just believe he should, if he's innocent as he's saying he is, he should bring in his lawyer, and let's get to the bottom of this and say what he needs to say and let's move on.""

"Washington (CNN) -- The U.S. Supreme Court opened on time Monday, despite the effects of Hurricane Sandy on the Washington area. Public sessions were to open as scheduled for two important hourlong oral arguments, according to court officials. One of the cases involved a privacy challenge to the government's secret domestic surveillance program, and the other examined whether copyright protections extend to books and other ""intellectual property"" produced overseas and then sold in the United States. In addition, the court released a summary of its pending business, such as appeals it will consider or has rejected. It will be ""business as usual"" Monday, said Kathy Arberg, the court's public information officer. Officials ""will continue to monitor the situation,"" she added. Later Monday, the court canceled its public session for Tuesday ""due to weather conditions related to Hurricane Sandy,"" it said. Oral arguments scheduled for that day have been rescheduled for Thursday at 10 a.m. Chief Justice John Roberts makes the ultimate call on whether to close and has consulted senior court staff. As an independent branch of government, the Supreme Court has wide discretion about its schedule. The rest of the federal government in the nation's capital was preemptively closed Monday, although key essential personnel were required to show up to work. Oral arguments are scheduled months in advance, and canceling or delaying them would create logistical and workload hassles for the high court and attorneys who argue before it. The court has a history of staying open despite inclement weather. The late Chief Justice William Rehnquist was known for ordering the court's 300-plus staff to work during snowstorms and other bad weather that paralyzed the rest of the city. During a major snowstorm in 1996, Rehnquist, a Wisconsin native, sent four-wheel-drive vehicles to pick up several justices from their homes. Justice David Souter insisted on driving himself and was slightly late to the day's oral arguments, while Justice John Paul Stevens was stuck in Florida and never made it to work that day.","NEW: Court cancels public session for Tuesday ""due to weather conditions""

"(CNN) -- Brazilian authorities arrested dozens of police officers on Tuesday, accusing them of taking bribes from drug traffickers. The 61 officers were paid to turn a blind eye to criminal activity in Brazil's Rio de Janeiro state, state public safety officials said. Investigators were still searching for two other officers suspected of involvement. An investigation revealed that the officers had received payments of 2,500 reals (about $1,200) every time they patrolled certain communities, the state-run Agencia Brasil said, citing authorities. Tuesday's arrests, dubbed ""Operation Purification,"" come as authorities work to increase security in Rio de Janeiro and stamp out drug gangs before the 2014 World Cup and the Olympic Games two years later. In October, police said they seized automatic weapons, guns and grenades and arrested dozens of people in a series of Rio de Janeiro slum raids. They announced they were going into the communities days in advance. Police said they take that approach to avoid major violence, but critics have said it simply gives criminals a chance to escape. In Tuesday's operation, authorities said they also arrested 11 drug-trafficking suspects. Brazil gang's slaughter of police sparks fightback .

"(CNN) -- The first of six Patriot missile batteries intended to protect Turkey from Syrian threats is operational along the countries' shared border, NATO said Saturday. The other five batteries, which NATO says are to be for defensive purposes only, are expected to be in place in coming days. NATO foreign ministers decided in December to deploy the batteries after Syria launched Scud missiles near the Turkish border. In October, errant Syrian artillery shells hit the Turkish border town of Akcakale. Mission impossible? Creating the 'Syria of the future' right now . The operational missile battery is in the city of Adana. Patriot systems will also be deployed to help protect the Turkish cities of Kahramanmaras and Gaziantep, NATO said. Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu said this month that the missile batteries will stay only as long as there is a threat. Their arrival came on yet another day of bloodshed in Syria, where the United Nations said recently that more than 60,000 have been killed since the conflict began nearly two years ago. At least 129 people were killed across the country Saturday, according to the Local Coordination Committees of Syria, a network of opposition activists. Forty-four of the deaths were in Aleppo province, 40 in Damascus and its suburbs, and 18 in Homs province. The Syrian crisis: Where's U.S. aid going? The group reported fierce shelling by the regime in the Damascus suburbs. Injuries were reported after aircraft dropped cluster bombs near Aleppo, the group said. Another opposition group, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, reported attacks by Syrian warplanes in cities and villages. Some of the deadliest aerial bombardments took place in Manjab in Aleppo's suburbs, where the Observatory reported eight children and two women were among 16 killed. The group also said 13 unidentified civilians had been killed ""by regime forces' gunfire"" around Daraya, the Damascus suburb where opposition activists had reported at least 245 people found dead over one August weekend. CNN cannot independently verify many claims from Syria, as the government has severely restricted access by international journalists. Despite widespread condemnation among world leaders, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad still has his supporters. On Saturday, a senior Iranian official said an attack on Syria would be regarded as a strike against Iran and its allies, according to Iran's semi-official Mehr News Agency. Ali Akbar Velayati, a senior advisor to Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the supreme leader of Iran, also praised Syria's logistical support for the Lebanese Shiite group Hezbollah, which the United States lists as a terrorist organization.

"(CNN) -- Colombian military combat planes opened fire on hidden rebel camps over the weekend, killing at least 20 members of the country's largest guerrilla group just days after negotiators finished a round of peace talks. A top faction leader of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia guerrillas was among the casualties, Gen. Mario Valencia told reporters Monday. Read more: Five facts about Colombia's FARC rebels . The leader, known by the alias ""Guillermo Pequeno"" (Little Guillermo), had been part of the leftist rebel group for 25 years, Valencia said. In July, Colombia's Defense Ministry offered a 1 billion-peso ($550,000) reward for information leading to his capture. Military officials described the weekend operation as a devastating blow to the rebel group known as the FARC, which has been at war with the South American nation's government since the 1960s. Read more: Colombia, FARC rebels begin formal peace talks in Norway . The airstrikes in Colombia's Narino department came a day after President Juan Manuel Santos gave a November 2013 deadline for ongoing peace talks with the rebels, which are scheduled to resume Friday. ""This process cannot take years, but months. ... But it is important to be patient and not demand immediate results,"" Santos said Saturday. Last week, negotiators from both sides concluded their first round of talks and voiced cautious optimism that they would eventually forge a peace deal. Read more: FARC ready to lay down arms if government does . The FARC announced last month that it would temporarily halt its battle against government forces as a goodwill gesture. The following day, rebels blew up two electricity towers in Colombia, CNN affiliate Caracol TV reported. The guerrillas later said they carried through with the attack because they were unaware of the cease-fire, Caracol said. Santos told CNN in September that the government would not participate in a cease-fire while the two sides were in negotiations. ""I've told them there will be cease-fire and we will stop any military operation when we reach a final agreement,"" Santos said. ""And if I see that there's no progress, that they are simply trying to buy time, I will stand up and continue business as usual. And that's why there's no cease-fire, no decrease in our military operations, and my government agenda will continue as it was until then."" There have been sporadic attempts at peace between FARC rebels and officials since the 1980s. The last fell apart in 2002. Then-President Andres Pastrana ceded an area the size of Switzerland to the guerrilla group, but he ended negotiations after rebels launched a series of attacks across the country in an apparent bid to strengthen their position.

"(CNN) -- The little-known South African Louis Oosthuizen shocked the world of golf as he stormed to his first ever major win on Sunday with a runaway seven-shot victory at the British Open at St. Andrews. Not bad for a farm boy who failed to make the cut in seven of his previous eight major championships. Oosthuizen joins Bobby Locke, Gary Player and Ernie Els as South African winners of the famous Claret Jug. Despite many having difficulty pronouncing his name, few will forget Lodewicus Theodorus ""Louis"" Oosthuizen's dazzling performance at St. Andrews. The win really is a fairytale story for the 27-year-old who lives on a farm in Gourits River, South Africa, next door to his parents. Oosthuizen, who also has a home in Manchester, England, was born in Mossel Bay, South Africa. His father was a farmer by trade yet all young Oosthuizen wanted to do growing up was play golf and tennis. Oosthuizen decided to ditch the tennis racket for good in favor of the club when he was 10 before spending three years at the Ernie Els & Fancourt Foundation during his teenage years. Oosthuizen seals runaway British Open victory . Oosthuizen is eternally grateful to the foundation, which was set up by Els in 1999 to help nurture South Africa's next generation of star golfers. It gave him financial support and coaching on the course his family could never offer their son. ""It was unbelievable what he (Ernie Els) did for me,"" Oosthuizen told the official British Open website. ""He is such a good mentor and probably without him, those three years in his foundation, I wouldn't have been here."" It was not long before the future British Open champion started tasting success after teaming up with compatriot Charl Schwartzel to win his first title at the World Junior Team Championships in 2000. The teenager then claimed six amateur titles including the Irish Amateur Open Stroke Play title in 2002 before turning professional at 19 in the same year. But despite hitting a 57 during a practice round on the par-72 Mossel Bay Golf Club course, along with gaining his European Tour card in 2003, his early performances in the paid ranks were less impressive. He did manage to record the first of his eight professional wins on home soil at the 2004 Vodacom Origins of Golf Tour. But joy was quickly turned into despair as ""Shrek"" -- as he is fondly known to his friends due to his gap-tooth smile -- failed to qualify for his first British Open at St Andrews in 2005. The season ended in disappointment as Oosthuizen finished 139th on the money list forcing him to return to qualifying school to regain his European Tour card. 'Shrek' takes charge at St.Andrews . The South African responded to the early setback by making 2007 his best year so far on the golf circuit, winning three titles on the Sunshine Tour including the Telkcom PGA championship. However, Oosthuizen's stop-start career continued as he failed to play in a major after missing the cuts for the Masters, the British Open and the PGA Championship in 2009. But 2010 is without doubt his most successful and memorable year on and off the course to date. First, Oosthuizen became a father after his wife Nel-Marie gave birth to their baby daughter Jana. Then in March he finally won his first European Tour event at the Open de Andalucia in Spain beating England's Richard Finch and Peter Whiteford of Scotland, who were tied second by three strokes. A victory of sorts in America was next, as the South African won the Par 3 Contest at the 2010 Masters in April, but he missed the cut in the tournament proper at Augusta. He also missed the weekend action in the U.S. Open at Pebble Beach so the signs were not promising as he traveled to the east coast of Scotland for the third major of the season. Having missed the cut at the British Open in 2004, 2006 and 2009, few, if any, envisaged him collecting the trophy at the end of play on Sunday. Yet Oosthuizen left Paul Casey, Lee Westwood and the world number one Tiger Woods in his wake, with his final round of one-under-par 71 giving him a 16-under total of 272 and his only major title so far.","Louis Oosthuizen stormed to his first major win at the British Open at St. Andrews .

"(CNN) -- LinkedIn hopes to jazz up its news feed with the addition of 150 super influencers on the network who fans can follow, a la Twitter. The elite circle includes President Obama, GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney, physician/writer Deepak Chopra, Virgin founder/CEO Richard Branson, motivational speaker Tony Robbins and Mashable's founder/CEO Pete Cashmore, among others. Fans can follow the celebs for regular updates, just like on Twitter. However, there are some differences. There's no 140-character limit on updates and the communication is designed to be business-related. ""Our goal is to always make sure that there's high quality,"" says Dan Roth, executive editor at LinkedIn. When asked when the next round of super-influencers will be added, Roth replied, ""The answer is we don't know."" LinkedIn has reason to wade cautiously into this Twitteresque feature. While fake accounts and off-subject tweets are part of that social network's charm, unleashing the same on LinkedIn could destroy its niche as a sober forum for business. As such, the activity of the initial 150 will be different than their Twitter feeds. ""People come here for a purpose,"" Roth says. ""They're at work or thinking about work. It's not about their personal lives."" The group's ability to engage LinkedIn's audience will be ranked by views, likes, comments and shares that are visible to all users. Such metrics will both act as a self-regulating feature, but will also prompt the inevitable ranking of the top 10 and bottom 10. The addition of the program is the latest evolution for the nine-year-old LinkedIn, which was initially little more than an online Rolodex. Over time, the site has emerged as a social network with its own hive of activity. Twitter's decision in June to no longer let users tweet to LinkedIn may have actually helped the company overcome criticism that it's a low-engagement network: PageLever, an analytics tool for Facebook Pages, found that the Twitter disentanglement actually prompted a 1,000% increase in page referrals from Facebook. Since the Twitter breakup, LinkedIn also ushered in a redesign that made it look more like Facebook or Google+. What do you think? Will this spur more activity on LinkedIn?

"Karachi, Pakistan (CNN) -- Most Pakistanis have rejected the defamatory attacks on the profile of Prophet of Islam Muhammad (Peace be Upon Him) in the movie ""Innocence of Muslims,"" which has triggered intensive protests and anger in Pakistan along with Egypt, Libya and Yemen. The government in Pakistan was the first to announce a public holiday and banned YouTube as a mark of protest. But this failed to calm the violent demonstrations and resulting violent mob actions. The country's big problem is that it suffers from natural disasters, terrorism, crime, poor living conditions and corrupt sociopolitical systems -- but there is little public debate. Erfan Aziz, an academician from Karachi, observed that ""the public in Pakistan has remained much oppressed in the past. Even the genuine issues of society were not allowed to be discussed in public. Notifications such as 'avoid political conversations' still may be seen in some public areas."" Many in Pakistan are seeking to convey a message to the international community by promoting mutual respect for each other's faiths. Kulsoom Shah, a Fulbright student, for example says young people must come up with creative ideas to register the hurt feelings that the movie provoked -- but peacefully. Shah said she applauded French students who distributed copies of the Quran in non-Muslim communities. In this way, productive ways to register feelings can help in debunking myths about Islam and promote it as a religion of peace. The present situation is sensitive indeed and cannot be dealt with in isolation. Islamic scholars seeking a modest approach should be brought forward on the popular media to calm people's resentment, while less coverage should be given to more hard-line political parties and public figures. Lindsey Boyle, from Ohio University, condemns the movie's offense and its overgeneralized tone. For one, the film does not represent popular U.S. opinion; second, the U.S. government has condemned the movie, so burning the American flag is not necessarily a reasonable reaction. Furthermore, she believes there are many similarities between Christianity's Jesus and Islam's Mohammed: They were both open-minded, helped the weak, overcame personal struggles and far more besides. The biggest problem in the world today, religiously and culturally, is misunderstanding. People on both sides of this situation simply need to take time to learn about one another. That becomes almost impossible when one side is making an over-generalized, demeaning movie, and the other side is violently protesting it in an overgeneralized way. We need to work to promote positive messages and understanding, above all else. Read about deadly anti-film protests in Pakistan . The question about the nature of protest remains a sensitive one, and it's far more difficult to motivate people to follow that in practical ways. Pakistani youth must realize the differences of mass media usage in U.S. society and protest in creative, constructive ways to get the desired results, as aggressive protests not only generate more violence and conflict but also make it easy to lose the true spirit of their cause. In the present world, human diversity and pluralism must be understood to promote peace and prosperity. We need peace and harmony, and to do this we must show tolerance and give space to each other's differences, be they color, race, creed, religion or nationality in order to promote a friendlier lifestyle around us.","There is little public debate in Pakistan, Fateh Muhammad writes .

"(CNN) -- On Wednesday night, an estimated 50 million Americans will watch the first presidential debate live, as President Barack Obama and GOP nominee Mitt Romney face off for 90 minutes in Denver. The odds are that many of those watching will have more than their TVs on as they do so: Millions are also likely to be glancing at their laptops or mobile phones, scanning the live conversation about the debates that will unfold over social networks and chiming in with their own comments. But while this burst of online chatter will undoubtedly affect the coverage and analysis of the debates, the bipartisan Commission on Presidential Debates has, unfortunately, taken only the most modest of steps to channel all of this public participation into something more meaningful than a digital water-cooler conversation. Despite all kinds of interesting experiments during the primaries, including questions from the audience via Twitter and inviting real-time feedback that moderators occasionally inserted into the live debate conversation, the commission is rolling out a quasi-interactive online tool that is bound to leave the public wanting much more. Opinion: Debate advice -- Obama, light a cig; Romney, throw deep . A week ago, the debate commission announced ""The Voice Of...,"" a digital platform that will be deployed on special landing pages hosted by Google, Yahoo and AOL to ""give people throughout the country the opportunity to share their voice."" Now, a day before the first debate, I've gotten a peek at the dashboard they're delivering, from the Yahoo page that has just gone live (the others are still placeholders). ""The Voice Of"" landing page offers three options: explore the issues, voice your view and watch the debates. Of those, the second choice is the most intriguing, because it gives participants the ability to not just say where they stand on topics like health care, energy, regulation, education, foreign affairs, terrorism, jobs, taxes and federal spending but to then see how they compare with other participants in the aggregate. A dynamic counter will then also show how many people have ""shared their voice."" This is very nice, and it will certainly be interesting to see how the live debate affects the results on ""The Voice Of..."" dashboards. But it barely scratches the surface of what the Internet could do to open up the debates, engage the public and allow for a more robust and accountable discussion of key issues by the candidates. It's kind of like if the debate commission got itself a synthesizer but just decided to use it to play ""Chopsticks."" To most people, ""sharing your voice"" means actually getting a sense that you are being listened to. Otherwise, what is the point of having a voice? Unlike broadcast television, the Internet is an arena of abundance. You don't need to speak in soundbites online or conduct pnly one-way, top-down conversations. Opinion: How will debates sway the undecideds? Instead of just creating an online playpen for a parallel but essentially disconnected national conversation about the debates, the commission could have built on work done during the primaries to capture and reflect public responses to the actual candidate responses, in real time. Or, as McCurry and Fahrenkopf promised in a little-noticed news release in July, they could also be using the Internet to enable the public to ""share their input with the debate moderators in advance of the debates."" There's still time for the commission to rethink this approach, but I'm not holding my breath. After all, the dirty little secret about the Commission on Presidential Debates is that is essentially a creature of the two major parties that views its job as managing an orderly joint television appearance that both major presidential campaigns will agree to. The real details of how these debates are run are actually hammered out in secret negotiations between top lawyers from both sides, as George Farah of the advocacy group OpenDebates.org has documented in detail. A whistle-blower leaked him the 2004 contract between the Bush and Kerry campaigns that showed that both sides had agreed that the two men would not ask each other direct questions, for example. In the town-hall-style debate, they also agreed that ""Audience members shall not ask follow-up questions or otherwise participate in the extended discussion, and the audience members' microphone shall be turned off after he or she completes asking the question."" If the presidential campaigns can go so far as to prohibit a live audience member in a town-hall-style debate from even asking a follow-up question, which is something that would happen naturally if it was a genuine town hall, then it's understandable why the commission's approach to the Internet is so compartmentalized and limited. This is a shame. But as a new generation of Americans who use social media naturally enters public life, this artificial wall between the voters and our would-be leaders will eventually come down.

"(CNN) -- Mitt Romney is expected to announce his vice presidential running mate any day, and the certain GOP nominee's campaign is asking supporters to download ""Mitt's VP"" app, which has the primary purpose of sending a push notification with the name of Romney's choice to users before the official announcement to the press. For the impatient, the Tech President blog has brought up an interesting possible early indicator: activity on potential picks' Wikipedia pages. In the past, Wikipedia activity has spiked for vice presidential picks the day before an official announcement was made. In 2008, hours before Republican candidate John McCain announced his vice presidential choice, Sarah Palin's Wikipedia page was getting a heavy edit. According to The Washington Post, the then-Alaska governor's page was changed 68 times the day before the announcement. In the 24 hours leading up to Obama's running mate announcement, Joe Biden's page was edited 40 times. While there's no official list of people being considered by the Romney campaign, a few names have been bouncing around, including Rob Portman, Marco Rubio, Tim Pawlenty and Paul Ryan. The Tech President looked at Wikipedia activity for these and other potential choices on Monday, and though it found some interesting numbers, no one page has yet seen the one-day levels of activity experienced by Palin's and Biden's in '08. On Monday, Wisconsin Rep. Paul Ryan had the most changes with 10, but on Tuesday, Ohio Sen. Rob Portman took the lead with 16 changes made by a Wikipedia user called River8009. The anonymous user deleted a section on controversies, a paragraph about NAFTA and various criticisms of Portman. When the seemingly biased edits were noticed, other Wikipedia users organized on Reddit message boards and acted to revert the changes and lock the page to prevent more tweaks. River8009 was flagged by Wikipedia for having a ""possible conflict of interest."" Marco Rubio's Wikipedia page was also quite active on Tuesday, and the comments on the changes are an interesting peek at the Florida senator's supporters and detractors. The primary argument was over whether to include a quote calling Rubio the ""crown prince of the tea party movement,"" with some tea party members disputing the title. Recent Wikipedia edits could be the work of hopeful candidates wanting to look better to the Romney campaign as it deliberates (though a presidential candidate likely uses more than Wikipedia to vet vice presidential running mates). It is also possible the Romney campaign has learned from the past coverage of Wikipedia edits and will only make changes gradually leading up to an official announcement.","In past elections, Wikipedia edits have served as signal for vice presidential picks .

"Guatemala City (CNN) -- Software mogul John McAfee could be deported to Belize on Thursday after being detained by immigration officials, a Guatemalan official said. Authorities took McAfee into custody Wednesday, said Francisco Cuevas, a spokesman for Guatemala's president, Otto Perez Molina. He is accused of entering Guatemala illegally. After weeks in hiding, the 67-year-old Internet security pioneer emerged publicly Tuesday in Guatemala's capital, hundreds of miles from the Caribbean island in Belize where his next-door neighbor was found dead. Read more: CNN Exclusive: McAfee talks about life on the run . Guatemala's foreign minister said earlier Wednesday that officials there did not know how McAfee entered the country and that there was no record of McAfee entering legally at any official border crossing. McAfee's lawyer, Telesforo Guerra, filed a formal request for asylum with Guatemalan officials Wednesday. He said McAfee left Belize to escape police persecution. Belize authorities have said they want to talk to McAfee about the November 11 shooting of his neighbor, American businessman Gregory Faull. ""I had nothing to do with his death,"" McAfee wrote on his website Tuesday in a message to Faull's family. ""I have lost five close family members in my 67 years and I know your suffering."" Read more: McAfee's girlfriend says he's 'frightened for his life' McAfee founded his namesake computer security software in 1987, initially running it out of his home in California. He sold his stake in McAfee Associates in 1994 and moved to Belize in 2008. The case began to unfold on November 9, when McAfee told police someone had poisoned four of his dogs. To put them out of their misery, he shot each in the head and buried them on his property, a former girlfriend said. Officials say the dogs' barking and aggressive behavior was a frequent source of friction between McAfee and Faull, a contractor who retired to Belize from Florida and lived next door. McAfee lived in the remote northern part of Ambergris Caye. Read more: Bizarre visit to McAfee's pleasure palace in Belize . Two days later, someone shot Faull in the head in his own living room. A 9 mm shell was found on the second step on the first floor, and Faull was found dead on the second floor. McAfee told CNN in the interview that he did not kill Faull and did not pay anybody to kill the man. He said he will not surrender to police for questioning, adding that his priority is to clear his name. Three people have been detained for questioning in the killing, police have said, and investigators are pursuing multiple leads. A 2009 story in the New York Times indicated that McAfee's fortune had plunged to $4 million from its $100 million peak, largely because of the real estate and stock market crashes that hit his investments.

"Guatemala City (CNN) -- The story of American tech mogul John McAfee reads like a bestselling mystery: murder, poisoned dogs, young women and international intrigue fueled by weeks on the run. But in the latest chapter of the saga, the millionaire says his month of evading Belizean authorities is over. And he plans to settle down in Guatemala, at least for now. ""I have a passport. I am in no trouble with the U.S. I can return any time I like,"" he told CNN en EspaÃÂ±ol in Guatemala City on Tuesday evening. ""I have been back to America many times since I have been in Belize. I have no interest of going this month or next but ... I can come and go freely to America any time I want."" McAfee has been on the run since authorities said he is wanted for questioning in the death of an American businessman who was his neighbor in the Belize island of Ambergris Caye. No more disguises . The 67-year-old Internet security founder emerged at the Guatemalan capital Tuesday, hundreds of miles away from the Belize island. Gone was his latest disguise -- as a wrinkly old man with salt and pepper hair. It was replaced by a dark-haired man in a dapper, pin-stripped suit. A woman in her 20s clung to his arm. Belize authorities have said McAfee is not a suspect. They only want to talk to him about the November 11 shooting of Gregory Faull, 52, who was found dead in his own home. ""I am not concerned because I have not been charged with a crime, so there is no basis for extradition,"" McAfee said from Guatemala. ""No one has blamed me for the murder. I have not been charged, I am not a suspect. ... They merely want to question me."" His lawyer, Telesforo Guerra, filed a formal request for asylum with Guatemalan officials Wednesday. ""I like Guatemala. I think the legal system in Guatemala is superior to the legal system in Belize,"" McAfee said. "" Guatemala is close, it is beautiful and most importantly, I enjoy the company of Guatemalans."" CNN Exclusive: McAfee comes out of hiding to talk about life on the run . Stranger-than-fiction . McAfee's arrival in Guatemala is the latest twist in a whirlwind investigation marked by stranger-than-fiction events. It all started on November 9, when he told police someone poisoned his four dogs. To put them out of their misery, he shot each in the head and buried them on his property, according to a former girlfriend. The dogs' barking and aggressive behavior was a frequent source of friction between the two neighbors. Two days after the dogs were poisoned, Faull was found fatally shot in the head. Fear of wrongful arrest, McAfee said, prompted his mission to evade police. His quest was aided by the women in his life. He speaks of many more women. ""It's almost surreal that I had how many -- six ..."" he said, as his latest girlfriend chuckled nearby. McAfee's former girlfriend: Internet pioneer is 'frightened for his life' Offering to meet in a 'neutral country' McAfee said Belize authorities are out to get him because he refused to pay a bribe to a politician months earlier. But the authorities said they want him for questioning in the killing. ""He's really gone out of his way to make the country look bad, and we just believe he should, if he's innocent as he's saying he is, he should bring in his lawyer, and let's get to the bottom of this and say what he needs to say and let's move on,"" said Raphael Martinez, spokesman for the Belize Police Department. McAfee offered to speak to Belizean police on the phone and meet with the Central American nation's prime minister ""in a neutral country."" While he apologized for the secrecy surrounding his relocation, he did not provide details about how -- or when -- he arrived in Guatemala. Guatemala's foreign minister said Wednesday that officials there did not know how McAfee came into the country. There is no registry of McAfee entering legally at any official border crossing, Foreign Minister Harold Caballeros told reporters. He declined to comment on whether his country would offer McAfee asylum. Belize won't seek his extradition, Martinez said. McAfee founded his namesake computer security software in 1987, initially running it out of his home in California. He sold his stake in the company in 1994 and moved to Belize in 2008. A 2009 story in the New York Times indicated that his fortune had plunged to $4 million from its $100 million peak, largely because of the real estate and stock market crashes that hit his investments. In February 2010, he started QuorumEx, which is trying to ""reinvent the way modern medicine combats and disarms pathogenic bacteria,"" according to its website. McAfee will hold a news conference Thursday, according to his blog.  He is expected to reveal the next move in the international mystery.

"(CNN) -- Here's a quick, slightly doctored (to protect the innocent) anecdote from the many-splendored, multi-faceted realm of real life: . One sunny day in the borough of Brooklyn, a couple of friends are sitting in a coffee shop, talking about a book that had one had recently read -- a dreadful piece of drek (in her opinion) detailing the true story of how the author had spent two years emulating the lifestyle of the lowly cockroach in order to prepare himself for the upcoming Mayan apocalypse. The disgruntled friend has just grandly exclaimed to her laughing pal something akin to, ""It's good that he's studying up to be the last dude on Earth, because that's the only way he'll ever get a date,"" when the young man across from the duo stands up, spills his coffee all over the table in a state of extreme agitation and cries, ""I'm sorry you hated my book so much! And for your information, tons of girls are into entomology!"" In the RL realm, such an instance could be seen as completely serendipitous, and the girl isn't really to be faulted for her less-than-favorable view of the book in question. But transpose this scenario into what is essentially the digital coffee shop of the Web -- Twitter -- and you have another situation altogether. More and more, Twitter is becoming a kind of online comment box, a place for fans and customers to weigh in with their myriad opinions. Which is good, in many instances. Brands get constructive feedback! Musicians and fans make friends and collaborate! An open dialogue is forged! In other cases, however, we have scenarios like those above -- scenarios where words a fan thinks are falling on deaf ears result in an explosion and scads of useless fighting. Read on for four ways you can drop a comment in the Twitter box without making enemies. (NB: If your aim is to instigate, that's all well and good. Trolls will be trolls. Still, do so at your own risk, because there's a fine line between a taunt and a threat. Be constructive . Your favorite band, Emo Screamo, has just posted their upcoming tour dates, and your hometown of Pinprick, USA, is unfortunately not on the docket this go-around. Rage and disappointment flood your eyes and a torrent of salty tears cascade onto your keyboard, effectively shorting out the ""F"" key. Blasting Emo Screamo's number-one hit, ""Time of Death: Your Kiss,"" you take to Twitter, sending off the following waterlogged words into the abyss, ""uck you, emo screamo! uck youuuuuuu!"" Emo Screamo's lead singer, Johnny Longbangs, happens to see your tweet and takes it to his black, black heart, shooting back at you in rage, ""uck you, too, you illiterate toolbag."" At first, the joy at seeing the you-addressed tweet in your timeline blinds you to his rageful words, and then the slow realization that your favorite singer likely hates you fills you to the eartips with anguish. ""I'm sorry, man,"" you type back rapidly, ""I just really wanted to you to play in Pinprick, ya know? I was just disappointed."" But it's too late, friend, Longbangs has retreated into his dark cave of sadness, and has vowed to never set foot (or ""oot"") in Pinprick as long as Emo Screamo is a band (which will be about six more months, tops). Yeah, that was all a little dramatic, but the main takeaway is: Be specific about your gripe, don't just rage. If you're sad that your favorite band is skipping your burg, tweet a special invite to play your church and crash on your couch; if a journalist gets a fact wrong, tweet a correction, don't call him/her an expletive, expletiving, expletive -- because you never know when the object of your ire will actually take note of your blistering display of inner turmoil. Be careful how you at-reply . Tweeting directly at a person, brand, etc. is equivalent to running up to him/her/it on the street and yelling, ""HEY, HEY, HEY, listen to me. I have something to say to YOU and only YOU!"" When it comes to people, before you hit ""@"" try to imagine yourself saying your piece to said person's face. Are you looking for a direct reaction from said person? Would you speak your tweet to his/her face? If not, maybe just tweet something a little more general (taking #1 into consideration). When tweeting at brands, think about your end game: Are you trying to get faster service from Time Warner? Sure, send a (see number one, constructive) tweet to the company. Expressing a blanket distaste for Candy Corn Oreos? Maybe don't personify the snacks by sending a tweet reading, ""@Oreo, your new candy-corned flavored spawn was obviously crafted in the bowels of hell."" Unless, you know, you want to be openly mocked on Dumb Tweets At Brands. Special exception for the dude who elicted this tweet from Dominos. Will your job take a hit? This should be obvious, but if you work in a certain industry, you should probably be careful what you say about that industry in a public sphere such as Twitter. Still, people are getting fired for doing just that, it seems, so we'll just leave this here. Does the medium fit the message? Tons of musicians got all up in arms the other week when singer Amanda Palmer put out a call on her blog asking for volunteers to play horns and strings -- for free -- during select gigs on her current tour (after raising more than a million dollars on Kickstarter for her new album). Obviously there was a plethora of meeping on the microblogging site, but musician Amy Vaillancourt-Sals scored the undivided attention of Palmer herself -- in the form of a lengthy open letter -- after she posted a thoughtful epistle to her idol on her website. Yeah, Palmer and Vaillancourt-Sals may still agree to disagree, but at least the latter managed to open up a dialogue with her considered and articulate letter -- a dialogue that would have lost a lot of its cohesion and luster if confined by character limits.","Twitter is becoming a kind of online comment box, a place for fans to weigh in .

"(CNN) -- Hey girl ... Mr. Gosling isn't the only Ryan with his own stable of Internet memes any more. Whether it's a texting secretary of state, a condescending candy magnate or an unimpressed gymnast, the Web can't help itself when it comes to turning current events into running online jokes. So, why should politics be any different? Enter Paul Ryan. The Wisconsin congressman was well known among political junkies, but not so much to the general public before presumptive Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney tapped him Saturday as his running mate. Within hours, the Web greeted the conservative budget hawk with a host of humor, some of it new and some given new life after lying dormant during the long, hot Washington summer. Here are some of our favorites so far: . 'Hey Girl, It's Paul Ryan' These women were meme-ing Ryan before meme-ing Ryan was cool. Back in May, the self-described ""Women who think fiscal sanity and conservative values are sexier than anything else"" started a Tumblr feed featuring photos of Ryan with captions merging his politics with a smooth, ""hey baby"" vibe. The blog borrowed from another Web meme: outings inspired by actor Ryan Gosling that include ""F--- Yeah Ryan Gosling"" and ""Feminist Ryan Gosling."" Some Ryan examples: . _ Hey girl ... you know I can't inflate our love. And that would just devalue it anyways. _ Hey girl ... unlike the debt, our love will never hit a ceiling. _ Hey girl ... I may be vying for #2 but you'll always be my #1 . _ Hey girl ... let's get fiscal. Apparently they're not alone in thinking deficit reduction is hot. According to Google stats, the most common term searched along with ""Paul Ryan"" this weekend was ""vice president."" The second most common? ""Shirtless."" The women had pretty much retired ""Hey Girl, It's Paul Ryan"" until Romney's announcement on Saturday. It's been off to the (presidential) races since then. Totally looks like ... OK, so it's focusing just on that hairdo-defining widow's peak of his, but the leading candidate for Ryan's celebrity lookalike so far has been Eddie Munster -- the similarly peaked kid from ""The Munsters."" But that's not all. Some folks see Gabe from ""The Office"" (i.e. actor Zach Woods). Others move a few cubicles down and compare him to ""Office"" character Ryan (aka B.J. Novak, who's already getting support from people who want him to play Ryan on ""Saturday Night Live."" Paul Ryan Gosling . If the women behind the ""Hey Girl"" blog are Ryan fans, it's safe to guess that whoever took the joke to Twitter is not. Comically merging the politician with the actor, @PaulRyanGosling was born Saturday and has quickly attracted more than 23,000 followers. Some sample tweets: . _ ""Hey girl, let's get rid of Socialist Security!"" _ ""Hey girl, you don't need Medicare for that hip replacement. You just need one of my hugs."" _ ""Hey girl, you can't spell Wisconsin without 'sin'."" Whether his newfound Web fame will help or hurt Ryan politically is anyone's guess -- although, in our mind, it's hard to picture someone deciding who should run the country based on a Photoshopped image of Ryan posing in front of the Oscar Mayer Weinermobile. (Yes, he has apparently driven it.) But there's one thing we can all be sure of. McKayla is not impressed.","Internet memes welcome Paul Ryan to the presidential race .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- President Bush on Thursday called on Congress to approve billions of dollars in additional funding for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan before lawmakers leave for their Christmas break. President Bush wants Congress to approve his request for war spending before the holidays. He said the Army will have to shut down bases and start furloughing between 100,000 and 200,000 civilian workers by mid-February if Congress does not clear the funds. ""Pentagon officials have warned Congress that the continued delay in funding our troops will soon begin to have a damaging impact on the operations of this department,"" Bush said Thursday. ""The warning has been laid out for the United States Congress to hear."" Defense Secretary Robert Gates already has ordered the Army and Marine Corps to plan for cutbacks, including civilian layoffs, termination of contracts and reduced operations at bases, The Associated Press reported. A $50 billion war spending bill, which would have required U.S. troops to begin leaving Iraq within 30 days, passed the House but stalled last week in the Senate -- with Republicans balking at the withdrawal provision. Speaking at the Pentagon, Bush called on Congress to approve the funds ""without strings and without delay.""  Watch Bush issue his stern warning Â» . In May, Bush vetoed another spending bill that included a non-binding goal of having combat troops out of Iraq by early next year. Majority Democrats in Congress eventually approved funds without that provision. The $50 billion for Iraq and Afghanistan that was approved by the House is about a quarter of what the administration requested. Congressional Democrats have disputed that, saying the Pentagon could shift existing funds to continue the efforts. ""The president demands more money to continue his failed war policy, yet he and his enablers in Congress have rejected our proposal for an additional $50 billion provided they work with us to change course in Iraq,"" said Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid. ""He cannot have it both ways."" Rep. John Murtha, a Pennsylvania Democrat who chairs the subcommittee that oversees Pentagon spending, said Thursday that House leaders may be open to a compromise on the spending plan. Just back from a visit to Iraq, Murtha -- a retired Marine colonel and Vietnam veteran -- said leadership may consider pushing back the deadline for troop withdrawal. ""We can get the troops out, but we can't get the equipment out probably in less than in two years,"" Murtha said. ""It's not logical unless we leave an awful lot of equipment there to think we can."" At a briefing with reporters, Murtha said the situation in Baghdad has improved. ""I think the surge is working, but that's only one element,"" he said. Murtha stressed that the administration needs to improve diplomatic efforts and provide Congress with an outline for how troops would be redeployed after an Iraq withdrawal. A spokesman for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Thursday the speaker has no intention of backing off a goal of having U.S. troops out of Iraq by next December and does not plan to revisit war funding before the end of the year. ""The speaker has said we will not initiate any funding legislation for the war this year,"" said spokesman Nadeam Elshami. ""The House has already passed $50 billion.""

"(CNN) -- A fake editorial about WikiLeaks, supposedly by the former executive editor of The New York Times, was making the rounds this weekend. It was mocked up so well that it even fooled at least one Times staffer. The fake piece, written under the name of the Times' Bill Keller, defended the controversial group known for acquiring, and publishing, secret documents from governments throughout the world. On Sunday, the group said its supporters were behind the hoax, which was published on a Web page that looks convincingly like a page on the Times' site. ""Yes. We admit it. WikiLeaks (Assange & co) and our great supporters where (sic) behind the successful NYTimes banking blockade hoax on @nytkeller,"" WikiLeaks posted on its official Twitter feed Sunday. Keller, meanwhile, also said the thoughts weren't his. ""There is a fake op-ed going around under my name, about WikiLeaks,"" he wrote, in all-caps, on his Twitter feed. ""Emphasis on 'fake.' As in, not mine."" The page was published with an opinion-nytimes.com URL instead of nytimes.com. It linked back to the Times site and resembled a real Times opinion piece in almost every way. Someone also created a fake Twitter account for Keller, replacing one of the lowercase L's in his name with a capital letter I, and tweeted out the editorial. The ruse fooled Nick Bilton, editor of the Times' Bits technology blog, among others. Bilton tweeted the faux post, then quickly deleted it. WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange has taken refuge in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London since last month. He is wanted for questioning on Sweden on sex abuse charges, which his supporters say are politically motivated. Assange, who denies the allegations, has said he fears that if he turns himself in, he'll be sent to the United States. He has angered U.S. officials by, among other things, publishing information allegedly documenting U.S. cyberattacks on Iran and a White House ""kill list"" of terror suspects. He has not been charged with any crime in either the United States or Sweden. In the fake editorial, it appeared that Keller, who has been critical of WikiLeaks, had decided to support the controversial organization. ""As those of you who have followed my turbulent relationship with WikiLeaks and its Guru-In-Chief Julian Assange know, I am first in line when it comes to distancing myself from his brand of transparency without government checks and balances,"" the fake post reads. ""(But) you don't have to embrace Assange as a kindred spirit to believe that what he did in publishing those cables falls under the protection of the First Amendment."" The post links to a February column by Keller when he remarked on being repeatedly asked to speak about WikiLeaks because he was the editor who approved the use of some of its releases in Times stories. ""It's amazing they keep inviting me to these things, since I'm a bit of a spoilsport,"" the real Keller wrote in that February column. ""My consistent answer to the ponderous question of how WikiLeaks transformed our world has been: really, not all that much. It was a hell of a story and a wild collaboration, but it did not herald, as the documentarians yearn to believe, some new digital age of transparency. In fact, if there is a larger point, it is quite the contrary.""","Fake editorial purportedly by ex-New York Times editor fools some on Web .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Republican Sen. Olympia Snowe has shown throughout her career that when it comes to voting, it's her principles and constituents that guide her, not her party. Sen. Olympia Snowe has received overwhelming support from her constituents in past elections. Those principles, analysts note, are guiding her to find a compromise on health care reform currently stalemated in Congress. Jennifer Duffy, who follows the Senate for the Cook Political Report, said Snowe's independent streak is ""not new behavior for her."" ""I think they [Republicans] also realize that the only reason that the state of Maine has two Republican senators at all is the fact that they are very independent-minded and they vote their state,"" she said, referring to Snowe and Sen. Susan Collins. In fact, some estimates place Snowe as having voted with her party only 57 percent of the time in the current Congress. While her moderate views are at odds with GOP opposition to several of President Obama's economic plans this year, the senator's constituents seem to agree with her. In 2006, she won re-election with 74 percent of the vote, compared to her Democratic opponent's 21 percent. In 2000, Snowe received 69 percent of the vote. In an interview with National Public Radio in 2006, she said that while her views are moderate, Maine, like other New England states, has been ""naturally independent"" ""Oftentimes, I tell my leadership, don't blame me, it's just where I grew up,"" she said at the time. Snowe, 59, was elected to Congress in 1978 at age 31, and served Maine's 2nd District for 16 years. She ran for Senate in 1994 and won, ""becoming the first woman in American history to serve in both houses of the state legislature and both houses of Congress,"" her Senate Web site notes. Her political career began in 1973 after her husband, Maine Rep. Peter Snowe, was killed in a car accident and she was elected to fill his seat. After two years in the state Senate, she won the U.S. House seat held by William Cohen when he ran for the U.S. Senate in 1978. Snowe was elected to the Senate with 60 percent of the vote during the Republican revolution of 1994, filling the seat of longtime Democratic Sen. George Mitchell, who retired. She married then-Maine Gov. John McKernan in 1989. In 2006, Time Magazine named her one of the top 10 U.S. senators, calling her ""the caretaker."" ""Because of her centrist views and eagerness to get beyond partisan point scoring, Maine Republican Olympia Snowe is in the center of every policy debate in Washington,"" the article read. ""But while Snowe is a major player on national issues, she is also known as one of the most effective advocates for her constituents."" Duffy said that if Snowe and Collins started voting with the Republican leadership all the time, ""They would probably both lose re-election."" Part of the so-called ""Gang of Six"" on the Senate Finance Committee, which includes three Democrats and three Republicans, she has been actively negotiating with the White House. The White House said that Sens. Chuck Grassley and Mike Enzi, the other two Republicans in the Gang of Six, have backed away from negotiations, although Enzi released a statement that said he is still willing to talk. Snowe said it's important to work with the other party despite criticism. ""I think sometimes, yes, I'd find myself in that position, you know, with fewer and fewer ... people who are willing to reach across the political aisle and to create what I ... call the sensible center,"" she told NPR last week. ""I mean, that's where the majority of Americans are. And I try to sort of build those ... bridges."" Part of that bridge building was seen with her votes for the president's $787 billion economic stimulus package in February. For the past months, Snowe has been pushing the idea of a safety net plan, or ""trigger,"" for a public health care option as part of a key compromise. A source familiar with her negotiations with Obama said that's one of the things they're talking about.  Watch more on the health care debate Â» . The idea would give insurance companies a defined period to make changes in order to help cover more people and drive down long-term costs. But if those changes failed to occur within the defined period, a trigger would provide for creating a public option to force change on the insurance companies. ""This option would be available from day one in any state where -- after market and insurance reforms are implemented -- affordable, competitive plans still do not exist,"" she said in a press release. Her main concerns so far have been the high cost of health care proposals. ""What we have to do is develop a plan that's going to be available to people on an affordable basis, and, secondly, containing costs both for the American consumer and the American taxpayer,"" Snowe said in the NPR interview last week. Cost has been a major part of her bipartisan efforts in the Senate. ""Given the gravity of our economic circumstances, I am pleased that our bipartisan negotiations have yielded a consensus solution that will create jobs, assist the displaced and invest in our economy,"" she said at the time about the stimulus plan. She added that it is not a ""matter of labeling something as spending or as tax relief; it's finding and including in this package the vital provisions necessary for jump-starting our economy.""

"(CNN) -- With its wonky arguments about taxes and health care, Wednesday's presidential debate may not have been the most riveting 90 minutes of the 2012 campaign.

"Sao Paulo, Brazil (CNN) -- They are an exclusive group of globe-trotting Internet investors, startup founders and tech junkies. Or you can just call them ""Geeks on a Plane."" The ""Geeks on a Plane"" project (yes, that's really what it's called), is an invite-only tour for startups, investors and executives to learn about burgeoning technology markets worldwide. Organized by 500 Startups, a Silcon Valley firm that helps fund emerging tech companies, the tour brought 42 tech insiders last week to Sao Paolo, Brazil. ""We are trying to understand what innovations are happening here... and what role investment or partnership with Brazilian companies can play in this blossoming of the Brazilian economy,"" Evan Henshaw-Plath, the pony-tailed founder of startup Cubox, said upon arriving at the group's swank downtown hotel. The tech sector in the world's sixth-largest economy is abuzz, prompting venture capital funds to invest in local startups and luring foreign firms to its growing market. Brazil now boasts the second highest number of Facebook users after the United States, and local tech industry leaders are fond of pointing out that Instagram co-founder Mike Krieger is from Brazil. ""It's the hottest place in South America. As we come here we're learning more and more that enforces that belief,"" said Tim Falls of Sendgrid, a Colorado-based tech company that's interested in expanding to Brazil. The traveling geeks spent the week networking, attending conferences and visiting local firms such as Predicta, a company founded in 2000 that specializes in online marketing. Predicta's co-founders told their visitors about potential pitfalls in the Brazilian tech sector, like a shortage of skilled programmers and employee benefits that can inflate salaries by 120%. But they also hammered home the country's selling points. ""Brazil has a very stable economy,"" Predicta President Marcelo Marzola said. ""Also, Brazilians are a very creative people by nature, so we're able to make a lot of creative stuff."" The main attraction for investors, however, is a booming consumer market. Brazilians already spend $13 billion a year online, with only 40% of the population regularly connected to the Internet -- a figure that seems poised to grow. There aren't any official figures, but tech sector experts here say the number of startups has tripled in the past three years. Global venture capital funds are taking notice. ""We made five or six investments in Brazil over the last nine months,"" said 500 Startups co-founder Dave McClure. ""So we're looking at expanding that and doing more in Brazil."" Other visiting entrepreneurs are interested in opening offices here. E-commerce website Etsy, which specializes in selling handmade crafts, was impressed by the size of the market, but put off by the bureaucracy and costs. ""I'm interested,;I'm convinced. But I'm not convinced that it's the next easiest place,"" said Etsy CTO Kellan Elliott-Mcrea. The visit wasn't all work and no play. The itinerary included a day trip to a water treatment plant to get a closeup look at reverse osmosis. The Brazil tour was the latest in a series of Geeks on a Plane trips that have brought tech execs and investors to India, China, Japan and other countries. Future tours are planned for Eastern Europe and the Middle East.","A group of 42 Internet investors and startup founders recently toured Brazil .

"(CNN) -- The inventor of the TV remote, Eugene Polley, died on Sunday at 96. After his death was announced on Tuesday, the Internet paused -- get it? -- to remember the man and the wireless television remote control, which ushered in the era of channel surfing and couch potatoes. Some tributes were humorous. Others were fawning. ""Gush all you want about Facebook, Twitter and other recent tech innovations. I'd stack Polley and his TV remote against all of them,"" wrote David Lazarus at LATimes.com. ""After all, which would you be more willing to give up -- Facebook or your remote? ... Thought so."" Polley, who died of ""natural causes,"" according to a news release, invented Zenith's ""Flash-Matic"" wireless remote control, which was introduced in 1955 and was heralded as the first of its kind. ""It used a flashlight-like device to activate photocells on the television set to change channels,"" the Zenith news release says. In the 1950s, the mechanics of using a remote were a little clunky: . ""The viewer used a highly directional flashlight to activate the four control functions, which turned the picture and sound on and off and changed channels by turning the tuner dial clockwise and counterclockwise,"" Zenith says. Rosa Golijan from MSNBC writes that eccentricities always have been part of the remote control and its odd history: . ""Because the remote shined visible light, TVs could be confused by other light sources. In spite of its quirkiness, the Flash-Matic was a revolution, and the reason Polley was bestowed with humorous titles ranging from 'the founding father of the couch potato' to 'the czar of zapping' to 'the beach boy of channel surfing.' "" And an advertisement from that era underscores just how new this invention was. ""A flash of magic light from across the room (no wires, no cords) turns set on, off or changes channels,"" one ad says, ""and you remain in your easy chair!"" Born in Chicago, Polley had a long career as an engineer at Zenith, where he worked his way up from the stockroom. His inventions, mostly in the field of television, earned 18 U.S. patents. Technology analysts, commentators and remote users are using the occasion of Polley's death to celebrate his invention and tease a bit about its legacy. ""Thanks for the belly Eugene,"" someone wrote on the tech blog Gizmodo's Facebook page. ""Just kidding. Great invention."" Others chose to focus on the way Polley, who won a Emmy Award from the National Academy of Television Arts & Sciences for his creation, changed the world with the invention. The TV remote was the precursor to interactive entertainment -- and it's part of the reason we're able to navigate digital content so freely, says The Atlantic's Alexis Madrigal. ""The new device meant people could change channels quickly and easily from the comfort of their sectionals, and that affordance meant that television stations could not continue to sell advertising or deliver programming the way that they had before when it was more difficult to change the channel,"" he writes. ""I do not think it is an accident that we started channel surfing (1986) before we started surfing the Web."" As if taking a cue from that thought, one Twitter user wrote: . ""R.I.P. Eugene Polley, inventor of the TV remote control. Please honor the man by reading this tweet for at least 5 seconds before scrolling."" Gizmodo also muses on the post-remote world: . ""Cordless control allowed audiences a vastly new experience of consuming television: For the first time ever, they could switch programs without getting up to turn the dial. No longer were programs endured simply because they were too lazy to get up off the couch. Commercials could be avoided by switching channels, or muted, with just the press of a button. 'Channel surfing' become a thing."" Who owns the remote in your home, and why? Tell us about your relationship with TV remotes in the comments section.","Eugene Polley, inventor of the wireless TV remote, dies at 96 .

"(CNN) -- It will cover 2.8 million square feet and have its own power plant inside its massive, gleaming circular design. It will be covered in solar panels and house up to 13,000 people on a daily basis -- not to mention 6,000 trees. It's been compared to a spaceship. And now, as Apple looks to make its innovative new headquarters a reality, it's checking with the neighbors. Due to be completed in 2015, Apple's new headquarters may be one of co-founder Steve Jobs' final, longest-lasting legacies. This week, Apple reached out to residents of Cupertino, California, where its current headquarters resides (and will continue to after the new campus is built). In a letter obtained by blog 9to5 Mac, the company seeks to allay some concerns that its neighbors have expressed since the plan was submitted to the city last summer. Former Apple employee explains 'upside-down' logo . According to the letter, the four-story building will be a research facility that will not replace the existing campus on 1 Infinite Loop. And it will not be open to the public, so there will be no museum or corporate store. The building will contain an auditorium that seats 1,000 and will be used for special events like product unveilings, though. The letter, from Apple Chief Financial Officer Peter Oppenheimer, says the company plans to break ground on the site as soon as Cupertino gives its approval, which is expected this year. Neighbors are invited to send Apple a letter or go to the city's website to express any concerns. In the suburban city of roughly 58,000 people, the primary concerns have focused on additional traffic and environmental impact, both of which Apple says it is addressing in the design of the campus, which is expected to get LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) certification as an environmentally friendly project. The new campus was one of the last major initiatives for Jobs, who died last year. In 2010, when HP abandoned its Cupertino campus, Jobs quietly arranged to buy the site, according to Walter Isaacson's biography, ""Steve Jobs."" ""I want to leave a signature campus that expresses the values of the company for generations,"" Jobs told Isaacson. A team of 50 architects was hired, and Jobs, as was his habit, was intimately involved in the details, according to the book. Much of the campus sits on the former site of an apricot orchard, and Jobs required that 80% of the campus be natural, with more than 6,000 trees. Apple hopes to raze 26 buildings on the site to make room for the ""spaceship,"" which will be surrounded by grass and trees. A June 7 City Council meeting was one of Jobs' last public appearances. At the meeting, he spent about 20 minutes introducing the project and answering questions. ""It's a little like a spaceship landed,"" he said as council members got their first look at the design. ""I think the overall feel of the place is going to be a zillion times better than it is now. ""I think we do have a shot of building the best office building in the world. I really do think architecture students will come here to see this. I think it could be that good.""","Apple is moving forward with ""spaceship"" campus in Cupertino .

"(CNN) -- Pre-order response to the iPhone 5 has been massive, outstripping expectations of analysts, who were bullish on Apple's latest smartphone to begin with, and apparently of Apple itself. Apple received more than 2 million pre-orders in the first 24 hours, double the number it got for last year's record-setting iPhone 4S release, the company said. Apple's initial promise to ship pre-ordered phones in a week, the same day they become available at Apple Stores and other retailers, was pushed back just an hour after pre-orders opened up at midnight Thursday. Now, it could take up to a month for the phones to ship. Wednesday morning, Apple's online store said a pre-ordered iPhone 5 would be shipped in three to four weeks. Apple hasn't released up-to-date pre-order numbers. But Piper Jaffrey analyst Gene Munster estimates the company could announce as many as 10 million sales by Monday morning. His ""worst case"" scenario is 6 million. Analyst Shaw Wu of Sterne Agee made light of initial reviews from the tech press that suggested the phone wasn't as new or different as Apple claims. ""We find it interesting that many tech blogs and reviewers panned the iPhone 5 saying it 'lacked the wow factor' similar to the iPhone 4 that was plagued by 'antenna-gate' and the iPhone 4S which was a relatively 'minor' and 'disappointing' update with Siri as the key new feature,"" he wrote. ""The previous iPhones went on to sell record number of units and we believe iPhone 5 will likely see a similar result."" Brian White of Topeka Capital Markets agrees, saying his initial prediction of 5.5 million sales over the weekend was probably way too low. Apple's stock, which crested at $700 per share this week, could spiral to a mind-boggling $1,100 by this time next year, he said. Some folks were already seeking to cash in on the wave of popularity Friday -- before they even got their hands on one of the phones. CNN iReport: Lining up for an iPhone 5? On eBay, an unlocked, 16GB iPhone 5 had been bid up to more than $1,200 on Friday, presumably by folks in countries where the smartphone won't be released for weeks. Others were selling at prices ranging from $650 to $1,000. The iPhone 5 will be available at Apple stores in the United States, which will open at 8 a.m. Friday. Also selling them will be AT&T, Sprint and Verizon stores and some Best Buy, RadioShack, Target and Walmart locations. As the debut nears, Apple has dropped the price of the iPhone 4S to $99 and the iPhone 4 is now free with a mobile service econtract.","iPhone 5 pre-sales outstrip expectations .

"(CNN) -- The GoDaddy outage saga continues. A hacker associated with Anonymous claimed responsibility on Monday for taking down websites housed by or registered with that Internet services company. But on Tuesday, GoDaddy, which says it is the world's largest host of secure websites, said the ""service outage was not caused by external influences."" ""It was not a 'hack' and it was not a denial of service attack (DDoS),"" Scott Wagner, GoDaddy's interim CEO, said in an e-mailed statement. ""We have determined the service outage was due to a series of internal network events that corrupted router data tables. ""Once the issues were identified, we took corrective actions to restore services for our customers and GoDaddy.com. We have implemented measures to prevent this from occurring again."" The company added: ""At no time was any customer data at risk or were any of our systems compromised."" Wagner also apologized to GoDaddy's customers and said that the company has a track record of having its computer servers up and working for customers 99.999% of the time. A Twitter user named @AnonymousOwn3r previously had claimed responsibility for taking down GoDaddy's system, impacting an untold number of websites that use the company to store their data or to register their Web addresses. The company says the ""intermittent service outage"" lasted from 1 to 7 p.m. ET on Monday.","GoDaddy says outage resulted from infrastructure problems .
