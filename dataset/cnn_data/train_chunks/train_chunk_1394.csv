"Indonesian divers may have found the body of the French co-pilot who was steering the AirAsia plane when it crashed into the Java Sea killing 162 people onboard, an official has confirmed. Coordinator of the search and rescue effort S.B. Supriyadi said the body, believed to be co-pilot Remi Plesel was retrieved from the front part of the fuselage during a search operation on Friday. 'It is likely the body of the French co-pilot, wearing uniform with three stripes on shoulder,' he told AFP, adding that the body is still being held onboard the Pacitan warship before being taken to land. Indonesian divers may have found the body of the co-pilot who was steering AirAsia plane when it crashed . A section of AirAsia flight QZ8501's tail is loaded onto a boat for transportation to Jakarta from Kumai Port . A formal confirmation will be given after the Disaster Victims Identification (DVI) team finish identifying the body, which is in poor condition, Supriyadi said. It was revealed by crash investigators last month that the French co-pilot was flying the plane before it crashed, rather than Captain Iriyanto, an experienced former fighter pilot. Two people close to the crash investigation said Captain Iriyanto had gone to disconnect the faulty Flight Augmentation Computer at the time of the accident leaving the co-pilot in control. Flight QZ8501 went down in stormy weather on December 28 in the Java sea during what was supposed to be a short trip from the Indonesian city of Surabaya to Singapore. Divers also found three bodies inside the main body of the plane on Friday and another three bodies near the fuselage, bringing a total number of dead retrieved to 101, Supriyadi said. Rescue services are still trying to lift the fuselage from the seabed using giant inflatable bags after earlier attempts failed. The AirAsia flight vanished from radar screens on December 28, less than half-way into a two-hour flight . Workers load the tail of AirAsia flight QZ8501 onto truck at Kumai sea port, in Central Kalimantan on Friday . It comes after the pilot of the AirAsia plane was out of his seat at the moment the plane stalled and was unable to stop the crash, sources have said. Investigators believe the computer malfunctioned during the flight, but instead of resetting it, the pilot climbed out of his seat and disconnected it from a circuit breaker located behind the co-pilot. During the few moments Iriyanto was out of his seat the co-pilot lost control. The plane climbed sharply, before either stalling or losing thrust, then fell almost straight down into the ocean below. By the time Iriyanto had managed to get back to his seat it was too late to save the aircraft. The Flight Augmentation Computer limits the movement of the plane, preventing pilots for pulling dangerous manouvres, rather like an electronic speed limiter in a car. One man familiar with the case said Mr Iriyanto had flown in the same Airbus A320 several days before the crash and was aware the device intermittently turned itself off. Indonesian divers found a body believed to belong to the French co-pilot of the AirAsia plane that crashed . Captain Iriyanto (left) got out of his seat to turn off a faulty computer, leaving co-pilot Remy Pelsel in charge . But even if the device had turned itself off it would not immediately affect the path of the aircraft. An A320 pilot, who did not wish to be named, said the device could be reset using a button on the dashboard, and struggled to explain why Mr Iriyanto would have felt it necessary to leave his seat. He said: 'To cut all power to it is very unusual. You don't pull the circuit breaker unless it was an absolute emergency. I don't know if there was one in this case, but it is very unusual.' Air Asia Flight QZ8501 plunged into the sea during a flight between Surabaya, Indonesia, to Singapore on December 28 killing everyone on board. Moments before the crash the pilot radioed air traffic control to report a storm ahead and asked to be allowed to climb above it, but was told the airspace was too busy. The aircraft's black box recorders have now been recovered from the seabed and are being examined for any clues they might hold on the plane's last moments. AirAsia said it would not comment while the matter was under investigation by the National Transportation SafetyCommittee (NTSC) of Indonesia. The Airbus A320 climbed suddenly before falling almost directly down into the Java Sea, killing all 162 people on board. Rescue workers are still pulling the wreckage from the ocean (pictured) The NTSC has said it is too early to say what role either human factors or equipment may have played in the crash, which is still being investigated. The head of the investigation, Mardjono Siswosuwarno, told . reporters this week it was too early to say whether the accident . involved pilot error or a mechanical fault. The NTSC said on Thursday the jet was in sound condition and . all crew members were properly certified. Airbus declined to comment. Lawyers for the family of the French co-pilot say they have . filed a lawsuit against AirAsia in Paris for 'endangering . the lives of others' by flying the route without official . authorisation on that day. Investigators have said the accident . was not related to the permit issue. AirAsia did not immediately respond to requests for comment . on the lawsuit.","Indonesian divers have found a body believed to be the French co-pilot .

"Criminal gangs are washing stolen bank notes in their homes in a bid to foil anti-theft technology. Detectives believe crooks in Greater Manchester are hand-washing cash bundles which have been stained with anti-theft 'SmartWater' dye to avoid detection. The luminous pigment is used to protect cash deliveries, covering notes with invisible and traceable dye in the event of a violent theft. Arrested in raid: Police officers lead away a handcuffed man in Salford after arresting him in connection with a gang who have attempted to wash stolen money to rid it of anti-theft dye . However, police can still detect the hi-tech dye using special equipment - enabling them to link dirty cash to the crooks who took it. Officers involved in recent raids in Greater Manchester were ordered to seize any suspicious items and clothing, including irons, which may have been used to flatten the washed notes, as well as examine water pipes for traces of the pigment, which they believe they can link to cash-in-transit robberies. It is alleged that the gang had attempted to get rid of the 'laundered' money through bookmakers, many of whom have now been alerted to the scam. The discovery was made as officers made raids to bring down an armed gang from Salford who were among the first to be targeted in a crackdown on Greater Manchester's most wanted criminals. It is alleged that the gang had attempted to get rid of the 'laundered' money through bookmakers, many of whom have now been alerted to the scam . Police say they can still detect the hi-tech dye using special equipment - enabling them to link dirty cash to the crooks who stole it . The warrants come as part of Operation Olympus, a force-wide month long crackdown to catch every suspect on GMP's list of sought-after crooks. Anti-theft dye is released from a dye-pack, a device invented as a way to non-violently render a bank robbery pointless. The dye permanently stains the stolen money a bright red color, alerting everyone to the fact that the money being passed to them is stolen. In most cases, a dye pack is placed in a hollowed-out space within a stack of banknotes and is virtually indistinguishable. Bank tellers have several of these packs near their station at all times. A pack is put in 'safe' mode by attaching it to a special magnetic plate. During a robbery, a teller tries to slip one of the dye packs into the money bag without the thief noticing. While the thief is still inside the bank, the dye pack remains dormant. Within the dye package is a small radio receiver that is activated when the pack is removed from the magnetic plate. A small radio transmitter is mounted inside or near the door frame of all entrances of the bank. Once the dye pack passes through the door and receives the specific radio frequency signal, it activates. The dye pack is usually set on a timer of 10 seconds or longer so that the criminal is either in his getaway car or running a good distance from the bank before the package explodes. Unlike traditional anti-theft dye, SmartWater dye is invisible and has a unique chemical signature that can link stolen notes to a specific crime scene. The revolutionary liquid is the brainchild of former policemen Phil Cleary. The robbery investigation, codenamed Freefall, was sparked following the theft of a motorbike. Yesterday morning, officers from the tactical aid unit attended five addresses in Salford arresting three suspected members of the gang. Detectives believe criminal gangs may even be hand-washing stolen bank notes stained with so-called Smart Water dye. Officers thoroughly searched the properties, including the water pipes for evidence that the gang had been trying to wash the hi-tech dye from plundered cash. In Higher Broughton, officers raided two properties - arresting one man. As part of their investigation, police studied CCTV footage of three seperate robberies at filling stations  to identify the suspects. In one, on Waterloo Road, in September, two men armed with a hammer threatened the cashier, stealing cigarettes. Det Con Laurence Elliot said: 'They even had the nerve to tell the people who were filling up to get going or they'd batter them.' At Morrisons, the robbers drove into the filling station in a Ford Connect van fitted with false plates. The driver stayed in the vehicle while his accomplice, armed with a machete, attacked the security guard, kicking him to the ground. He can be seen on CCTV footage dragging the security guard across the ground and allegedly threatening to cut his face off. The gang is also believed to have targeted a jewellers in Manchester Road making off with a large amount of gold. Det Con Sean Loughlin said: 'We are here to target a nasty group of individuals who have been targeting businesses in a violent way. 'For the past few months they have been causing mayhem everywhere from post offices to garages using machetes and violence.' In the weeks ahead of the raids, two of the suspects are believed to have attacked two female police officers during a random stop, punching them to the ground .

"A teacher has created an incredible friendship with a student 14 years after the teen's assault claim ended his career. Josh Kaplowitz was teaching troubled students at Emery Elementary School in Washington D.C. in September 2001 when seven-year-old Raynard Ware said he manhandled him. The incident led to the Yale graduate's arrest and 33 hours in a detention cell. Just two days later he was also fired and his career was finished. But the pair have now rekindled after Ware reached out, saying he apologized for 'everything that happened' after 're-evaluating the past'. Rekindled: Former teacher Josh Kaplowitz (left) and Raynard Ware have created a friendship 14 years after the student's assault claim at Emery Elementary School in Washington D.C. left his career in tatters . Ware's mother filed a $20million lawsuit against him - which led to his acquittal during the criminal case - but the state's education department settled for $90,000. Since then Kaplowitz has been back to college and is now working as a lawyer at a top D.C, firm, while Ware, who was considered a troubled child at school, is currently a a business major at Morehouse College in Atlanta and hoping to pursue a career in finance with JP Morgan. The pair had not any contact until 2012 - when Ware decided to send Kaplowitz a Facebook friend request. He told his mother it was 'all about forgiveness'. It took Kaplowitz days - including consultations with his wife and past employees - to decide whether to respond. He told the Washington Post his thoughts were: 'You ruined my life' and had only got over the incident a couple of years beforehand. Future: Kaplowitz gives Raynard Ware a tour of Crowell & Moring, the law firm he works at in Washington, DC. The Yale graduate has rebuilt his career after he was arrested in 2001 following claims he pushed Ware . Kaplowitz had turned down a job working for Al Gore's presidential campaign to into teaching, believing he would have an impact on children's lives. But he soon realized he was not cut out for it. He told The Post: 'I never hurt a kid. But I was not a good teacher, and I yelled a lot. I was in the survival mind-set of getting through the day. If there's one thing I try to block out, it's what a lousy teacher I was most of the time.' The father accepted the request and then received a message from Ware saying: 'Hey, Mr. Kaplowitz I'm Raynard as you can see. I just wanted to say I'm doing well. I graduated high school with a 3.6. I also had scholarship offers from Georgetown, Yale and Morehouse. I choose to attend Morehouse because I felt I wasn't prepared for Yale or Georgetown. ... I've re-evaluated the past incident and I just want to say I apologize for everything that happened. I would really appreciate it if I could hear back from you. ttyl!!' A few weeks later, Kaplowitz replied saying: 'Raynard — it's a pleasant surprise to hear from you, and great to find out how well you are doing. ... I have gained some perspective of my own over the last 10+ years, and I now have a son who is the same age as you were when you were in my class. From Raynard Ware on January 23, 2012 . Hey, Mr. Kaplowitz I'm Raynard as you can see. I just wanted to say I'm doing well. I graduated high school with a 3.6. I also had scholarship offers from Georgetown, Yale and Morehouse.

I have gained some perspective of my own over the last 10+ years, and I now have a son who is the same age as you were when you were in my class. While I deeply appreciate your apology, you should know that I don't blame you and never took anything that happened personally. The whole thing obviously had a big impact on my life, but I'm doing well now with a family and a new career as a lawyer. ... I'd be happy to meet you to catch up further. ... Ware was considered a troubled student while at school. But he decided to move away from his dysfunctional life and is now a business major at Morehouse College in Atlanta. He reached out to Kaplowitz in 2012 . Looking forward: The pair, pictured next to the playground of the old elementary school, are looking at writing a book about their experiences . 'While I deeply appreciate your apology, you should know that I don't blame you and never took anything that happened personally. The whole thing obviously had a big impact on my life, but I'm doing well now with a family and a new career as a lawyer. ... I'd be happy to meet you to catch up further. ...' The pair then met for lunch at a City Grill. They avoided talking about what happened - instead talking about Ware's progress. But at the end of the meeting, the former teacher asked whether he wanted to write a book on the incident and their relationship. He believes it would provide a second chance for him - even though he his concerned some may take his story the wrong way. The Post reported that Ware liked the notion of letting the world know that he was moving on up, escaping a dysfunctional life. Ware told the paper: 'He gets validation from me, knowing he wasn't as bad a teacher as he thought he was, that he made an impact in my life, that now we're both doing well. 'And I learn a lot from Josh. I pick up little things, certain lingo, being in corporate America like Josh is. I watch people really closely. I grew up very quiet, and people think I'm not listening, but I take it all in.'

"Escaped jail: Carer Leanne Edwards, 39, walked free from court yesterday despite being caught red-handed stealing cash from a frail great-grandmother . A carer who was caught red-handed stealing cash from a dementia-suffering great-grandmother after her suspicious family installed a spy camera has walked free from court. Leanne Edwards, 39, was filmed taking money belonging to frail Irene Goody, 85, by a concealed camera set up by the pensioner's son-in-law Edward Helps and wife Susan. The couple said they were forced to turn detective after police told them they could do nothing to help because they were 'too busy and understaffed'. Mr Helps, 61, then bought a £120 secret recording device off the internet and set it up at the sheltered flat in Droitwich, Worcestershire. Despite damning footage capturing Edwards rifling through Irene's drawers and pocketing cash from her purse the care worker avoided prison yesterday. She was handed handed a 14-week prison sentence, suspended for 12 months at Worcester Magistrates Court. District Judge Nigel Cadbury said there was 'no point' sending Edwards to prison immediately because of her vulnerable state. He said: 'You have got previous convictions for dishonesty, so you can clearly be described as dishonest. 'The facts of this case are particularly harrowing. You were supposed to care for an 85-year-old woman who is unable to care for herself. 'It took surveillance cameras to catch you at it. You admitted the offence, but you still did not plead guilty until the day of the trial. 'Anybody reading about this case will think is is abhorrent. What you have done has easily crossed the custody threshold. 'I have no idea why previous magistrates suggested otherwise. They just have been reading the wrong guidelines. Scroll down for video . Caught in the act: Edwards was seen on camera stealing from dementia sufferer Irene Goody, 85, after Mrs Goody's family became concerned that money was going missing and set up a CCTV camera in her flat . 'Anybody reading about this must know that stealing from an 85-year-old woman could results them going to prison, it must be a deterrent. 'But there is no point sending someone with your emotional and physical issues to prison, into an environment that will only exacerbate the problem. 'Some people reading about this may think I am being soft, but there is no point sending you away for what will be a very short period of time.' The court heard Edwards had been privately employed by the family of Mrs Goody - who is in the early stages of dementia - to visit her every evening. She was entrusted with making sure the retired seamstress, who has eight grandchildren and two great-grandchildren, had taken her daily medication. Prosecutor Jackie Rogers said the family first noticed something was wrong when money started going missing last March. Edwards, pictured with her T-shirt stuck in a draw, admitted theft in court last month but has escaped jail . Let off: District Judge Nigel Cadbury said there was 'no point' sending Edwards to prison immediately because of her vulnerable state . She added: 'Mrs Helps replaced the money but she received a call from the warden for the place where her mother lived saying that her mother was very distressed that money for a meal out had gone missing from her purse. 'She asked he husband to instal some cameras and they were put in in August when he mother was asleep so as not to notify her to their presence. 'When the defendant was arrested she admitted to taking the money, but claimed that she had been given permission to take it by Mr Edwards. 'I believe that is the defence she planned on using in court. 'She did not change her guilty plea until the very last minute, the afternoon of the trial in fact. 'The surveillance footage shows her taking the money. 'At one point the defendant even called Mrs Helps and claimed the money she was owed for caring duties had also gone missing. 'This is aggravated by the fact that the theft was from a dwelling, and is in particularly distressing circumstances.' Joanne Outhwaite, defending, said Edwards had been through an abusive relationship and money troubles and had used the money to pay off debts. She added: 'She doesn't want to use this as an excuse. 'She understands what she did and the distress she caused. She was on the verge of losing her home and had suffered a major illness that stopped her working. 'She used the money to pay for living costs.' Position of trust: Edwards had been privately employed by the family of Mrs Goody - who is in the early stages of dementia - to visit her every evening . The thefts took place at The Heriotts sheltered housing in Worcestershire where Edwards had been privately employed by the family to come in and help Mrs Goody. The home's managers assisted the investigation . Edwards, from Droitwich, had pleaded guilty to stealing £120 between May and September last yea at an earlier hearing on January 19. After the case Mr Helps, a company director, said: 'It's a bit disappointing really, it doesn't send out the strongest message. 'She was in a position of trust and she severely breached that trust, we would have liked to have seen a stronger sentence but more than anything we wanted people to know what she had done. 'Hopefully that way, it won't happen to other people in future and make people think twice about committing similar crimes.' Edwards was also ordered to pay £120 compensation, an £85 victim surcharge and £620 in costs, as well as undergo a 12 month community order.","Leanne Edwards, 39 filmed stealing money from frail Irene Goody, 85 .

"An investigation into the offensive online postings of the teenage daughter of a New Jersey police officer - who dressed up as Hitler and threatened to 'bomb' a shop where Jewish people were congregated - has cleared the girl of any criminal charges. The teen - who has not been identified because she is a minor - posted a series of outrageous items to Twitter, including photos of herself dressed as Hitler adorned with homemade swastika symbols. One photo, in which she appears to be wearing a State Police hat, was captioned: '1944: crematorium crew.' Her father is a State Police sergeant, the Ashbury Park Press reported. Another showed an Italian ice shop in Jackson, New Jersey, where a large group of Jewish people had gathered, with the caption: 'perfect bombing time.' Shocking: The offensive online postings by the Jackson teen - who has not been identified because she is a minor - were found to pose no credible threat, according to an investigation . Offensive: One of the most shocking posts showed a large group of Jewish people congregated outside an Italian ice shop in Jackson, New Jersey, with the caption: 'perfect bombing time.' In another tweet, the user wrote: 'I really wanna drive around Lakewood and run over every Jew with my car.' Jackson is a neighboring township of Lakewood, which has an increasing Jewish population. The Ocean County Prosecutor's Office launched an investigation into the array of posts. However it was concluded that, while abusive, the teen had not committed a crime and the posts did not amount to a credible threat. 'There was never any danger being posed to the community,' a spokesman for the office told the Ashbury Park Press. 'It didn't rise to anything criminal.' The spokesman also maintained that the position held by the girl's father did nothing to sway the decision. But the outcome has angered many, who say the situation would have been vastly different if the girl wasn't white. Outrageous: The teen uploaded pictures of herself dressed as Hitler  and tweeted about killing Jews . 'If it had been a Muslim, this almost certainly would have been handled differently,' Ibraham Hooper, communications director for the Council on American-Islamic Relations, a Muslim civil liberties advocacy organization, told the APP. 'If it's associated with Muslims, it will be viewed as terrorism. 'If not, it will be viewed as something random and minor.' An investigation found the posts - most of which featured the girl, but others featured people she knew - posed no credible threat and were not criminal . The Tweets were put up in January. Some of the offensive content came from different people, but most was the daughter of the police officer. Her account has since been deactivated. The Jackson Township School District - where the girl goes to school - confirmed it had been made aware of the matter but refused to comment further.","Daughter of New Jersey State Police sergeant posted photos to Twitter .

In October 2014, Dushyant, pictured with his sisters Jyotika, Devaanshi and Tejal, started to suffer a series of colds that he couldn't shake off, he became increasingly breathless and recognising the signs his mother Kalyani Mehta contacted the specialists at Great Ormond Street Hospital that treated his sister . His mother, Kalyani Mehta, 47, from Harrow, is appealing for people to sign the register, in the hope it will help save her son's life. 'We desperately need a donor for Dushyant and we now know there is not currently anyone on any of the world's registers who is a match for him. 'However, it is also really important to us to help other people who are looking for donors. 'The only thing we have is hope and more donors on the register mean more hope for all patients in need of a transplant.' Devaanshi was diagnosed with dyskeratosis congenita - a rare illness that causes bone marrow failure - when she was nine years old. Dyskeratosis congenita is a disorder that affects many parts of the body. The three main features are that the finger and toenails grow poorly, or are abnormally shaped, changes in skin colouring especially on the neck and chest and white patches inside the mouth. Sufferers have an increased risk of developing several life-threatening conditions. They are very susceptible to disorders that cause the bone marrow to fail, affecting the bone marrow's ability to produce new blood cells. It can cause aplastic anaemia, also known as bone marrow failure, which occurs when the bone marrow does not produce enough new blood cells. Those diagnosed with the condition are also at an increased risk of leukaemia. Initially doctors believed she was suffering severe aplastic anaemia - a condition where the bone marrow fails to make enough red blood cells for the body. But doctors soon realised the diagnosis was wrong and discovered the much rarer dyskeratosis congenita illness was to blame. Her devastated family were told she would need a bone marrow transplant. All three of her siblings - her two older sisters, and her younger brother - were tested and Dushyant was found to be a match. He was only two at the time, but in April 2007, Dushyant donated bone marrow to his sister. Despite the transplant, Devaanshi was left dependent on platelet and blood transfusions and she launched a campaign to encourage more people to become blood, organ, and bone marrow donors. In 2010, Devaanshi's lungs collapsed and were left so badly damaged that she was told her illness was incurable. Despite her failing health, she continued to organise fundraising events and to inspire Asian people to become donors. She died at Great Ormond Street Hospital five years after her transplant. Dushyant donated his bone marrow to help extend his sister's life when he was just two years old . Dushyant now desperately needs a bone marrow transplant and with no matches available,  his family are urging people to sign the register in the hope it will save his life . Two years after the 15-year-old's death, in October 2014, Dushyant suffered a series of colds that he couldn't shake off. He became increasingly breathless and recognising the signs, Mrs Mehta contacted the specialists at Great Ormond Street that had treated her daughter. Tests confirmed the family's fears - Dushyant has the same rare illness that claimed his sister's life. His mother was told he too would need a bone marrow transplant to give him the greatest chance of survival. His doctors turned to the charity Anthony Nolan asking them to search the world's registers for a potential match. But this search failed, prompting Dushyant's family to issue a desperate plea for more people to sign the register. They have been warned it is more difficult to find a match because the 10-year-old is from Indian heritage and people from ethnic minority backgrounds are under represented on the registers. Ms Mehta urged more people from Asian backgrounds to sign up. 'Signing up is about saving someone's life,' she said. 'It is that important and it is particularly vital to encourage people from ethnic minority backgrounds to sign up.' If you are aged 16 to 30 and in good health you can sign the Anthony Nolan register at their website here.","Dushyant Mehta, 10, donated bone marrow to his sister when he was two .

"Debt-ridden David Pottinger (pictured) stole money from a fund for children with special needs after he got into money troubles following a lengthy divorce . A former finance boss at Sandwell Council who stole nearly £30,000 from a fund for children with special needs has been spared jail. Debt-ridden David Pottinger, 37, claimed cash from the fund after he got into money troubles following a lengthy divorce, a court heard. Pottinger, a qualified accountant, made off with £29,118 in a string of 32 separate fraudulent transactions before he was caught. The council officer then tried to implicate an innocent colleague in the scam, by using his name to cover the tracks of the theft. Yesterday he was handed a 16-month suspended prison sentence and ordered to carry out 150 unpaid work after admitting seven charges of fraud by abuse of position. The court heard the father-of-one had become 'desperate' as he was being chased by 13 payday loan firms. Passing sentence Recorder Sandra Bristoll said Potting had: 'Abused his position of trust with the council.' She added: 'This was a sophisticated and well planned fraud involving two fraudulent transactions amounting to £29,118. 'The fact that you used a colleagues name to try and cover up the crime is an aggravating feature.' Mark Jackson, prosecuting, told the court that Pottinger, who worked for Sandwell Borough Council for 12 years, was rumbled when a colleague notices the 'unusual' transactions. He said payments went out from the fund to children who did not exist to cover fake transport costs. Former finance boss at Sandwell Council (pictured) David Pottinger stole nearly £30,000 from a fund for children with special needs . Mukhtar Ubli, defending, told the court Pottinger had become 'desperate' and was being chased by a series of loan firms. Speaking after the case Sandwell Council deputy leader Coun Steve Eling said: 'David Pottinger tried to defraud the council and he didn't get away with it. 'This was a contemptible crime carried out by a trusted member of staff. He has rightfully been convicted. 'We acted immediately when we uncovered the fraud and I'm glad to say it was stopped at a relatively early stage so there is no impact on people who use the service. Pottinger was handed a 16-month suspended prison sentence and ordered to carry out 150 unpaid work after admitting seven charges of fraud by abuse of position at Wolverhampton Crown Court (pictured) 'It's important to recognise that many council employees are in positions that require the highest level of trust and integrity. 'It's extremely disappointing on the rare occasions when this is broken. We won't hesitate to act when we find this sort of wrongdoing. 'Any employee thinking of defrauding the public needs to understand that they will be caught.","David Pottinger, 37, claimed cash from a fund for  special needs children .

"Kind-hearted strangers offered up their spare bedrooms to a middle-class couple forced to sleep in Heathrow after losing their home. Well-wishers flooded Katrina Smith, 62, and Alan Lane, 71, with offers after reading of their plight in the Daily Mail this weekend. The couple spend five nights a week sleeping in Heathrow Airport after losing their home in Dorset and all of their savings. Their only luxury is a room in a £50 airport B&B twice a week when they forego proper meals for beds and access to a washing machine. Alan Lane and Katrina Smith have been inundated with offers of accommodation from kind-hearted strangers since sharing their story. The couple have been sleeping at Heathrow Airport after losing their home 18 months ago . Within hours of their story being shared online, the couple received more than £9,000 in donations from kind strangers across the world via a Go Fund Me page set up in their name . Since sharing their heartbreaking story, Good Samaritans across the UK have come forward to lend a hand. More than £9,000 has been raised through a GoFundMe page set up in their name by a stranger. 'We're just totally bowled over and gobsmacked. 'We're trying to get our heads around it. People in this country are just great. It's amazing and totally renews faith in the human spirit,' Mrs Smith told MailOnline. The couple will stay in the B&B for a few more nights as it was prepaid, but said they could not express enough thanks for the offers of accommodation and donations to help them get back on their feet. Julie Nairn, a volunteer who works with the elderly and lonely, has offered the couple free accommodation at a self-contained flat at her New Forest home for a month. The 63-year-old and her husband, Christopher, said they felt obliged to help Mr Smith and Ms Lane, because theirs is a fate that 'could happen to anyone'. 'We just simply want to help. There are a lot of people out there like this but you don't often hear of them. 'It brings it home to you, there are hard working people out there who are given bad advice and they try to do be independent and do the right thing but they lose everything. Mrs Smith was moved to tears by the kindness of people offering their homes, while Mr Lane described their generosity as 'amazing'. Among the well-wishers to have offered to take them in is Christopher and Julie Nairn (right) who live in the New Forest . The couple were living in Poole, Dorset, before becoming overwhelmed by debt. Neither has signed on to benefits, but their monthly income is not enough to allow for rent and loan repayment . 'It's appalling that no local councils or government can help them.' Mr and Mrs Nairn have offered the couple free accommodation at their home for a month,while Bero Ganger, a single foster carer who lives near Heathrow in Southall, said they could stay in her spare bedroom 'for as long as they need'. 'I feel so sorry for them, it has struck a chord with me and I really want to help. 'I have a spare room in my home where I am a foster carer which they can have for as long as they need until they get back on their feet,' the 55-year-old said. 'Even if they just want to come for a coffee, chat or a shower, they are welcome. Whatever they need.' Meanwhile an online donations page has been set up in the hope of raising enough money for the couple to find a new home. Natalie Longford, a mother-of-one from Stockton-on-Tees, set up the GoFundMe page (found here) which has raised more than £9,000. 'It could happen to anybody, I just want to help them and this is an easy way to do it,' said Ms Longford. The funds will be handed over once released by Go Fund Me, with Miss Longford able to grant Mr Lane and Ms Smith access to the account. The couple were forced to move out of their home in Dorset (above). They now spend some nights in the airport and others at a B&B nearby, foregoing meals to afford the room and access to a washing machine . Mr Lane and Ms Smith had to give up their home in Poole, Dorset, 18 months ago, after a string of bad luck and poor financial advice. They have been living hand-to-mouth since, spending their nights in different sections of Heathrow Airport. While the couple have a limited income, it is not enough to cover their debts and a month's rent, let alone a deposit for a new flat or house. Despite being eligible to claim Job Seeker's Allowance, Ms Smith has never signed on. Before finding themselves without a home, Mr Lane worked as a communications consultant. But in a matter of years the number of contracts he retained dwindled. Ms Smith desperately applied for supermarket cashier jobs and positions in nurseries, but was consistently passed over for younger applicants. Now they choose whether to eat or spend the night in a B&B, with weight 'slipping off' Mr Smith, 71. While missing simple luxuries (Mrs Smith would most like to be able to make a cup of tea for herself when she wants one), the couple remained upbeat despite their circumstances. 'As soon as our luck changes, as soon as an opportunity comes our way, we’ll be up and running again with a new life,' Mr Lane said yesterday. While Heathrow has a group of dedicated social workers offering support to people found sleeping rough in its terminals, no one from the team has approached the couple.","Katrina Smith and Alan Lane have been sleeping in the London airport .

"An RAF training plane came dangerously close to colliding with a remote controlled aircraft while flying above Cambridgeshire, it has emerged. The plane came to within just 40ft of the remote-controlled model aircraft, which the report stated may have been flying at 600ft. A UK Airprox Board report labelled the incident on February 4 2014 as 'high severity' and said the 'safety of the aircraft may have been compromised'. Scroll down for video . A Tutor training plane similar to the one being flown above Northborough on February 4 last year . The trainer, from RAF Wyton near Huntingdon, had to take evasive action when the near-miss happened above the village of Northborough, near Peterborough, Cambridgeshire. The pilot of the Tutor aircraft was forced to bank hard to the left in order to avoid a collision after it appeared both aircraft were flying at the same height. The report stated: 'The differing perceptions of aircraft height from the Tutor pilot and model aircraft operator are fundamental to this incident. 'The model aircraft operator believed that his aircraft was flying considerably lower than seemed to be the case, backed up by the evidence of the Tutor’s height from radar replays.' While the report said the local model aircraft flying club had been permitted to use the airspace, the safety board report concluded 'safety margins had been much reduced'. The board suggested because nearby RAF Wittering had changed to a non-flying base, users of the airspace had become less aware of dangers. It said all operators in the area needed to be alert to each other's activities. The Ministry of Defence said RAF Wittering had since returned to flying status. Peterborough Area Radio Control Society member Dave Wood said he was familiar with the incident. 'We can only gauge that height that we're flying and we tend not to fly too high anyway. You're not likely to go up too high anyway - but we're bound to keep within 400ft with models that are (under) 7kgs. 'I wasn't the person involved. He reported the incident because he felt it necessary that the full sized aircraft are aware that we are there because we've been there for forty years.' The club's secretary Paul Holroyd declined to comment, saying that he disputed some of the facts in the report.","Training plane came within 40ft of RC aircraft in near collision .

"The airline whose plane crashed into a Taipei river has cancelled 90 flights over the next three days and it puts its pilots through special training. The dozens of pilots who operate TransAsia Airways' ATR propeller-jets began proficiency tests on Saturday, three days after one of the carrier's ATRs crashed into the Keelung River, killing at least 40 people. Incredible images emerged of the aircraft clipping an elevated motorway, with one of its wing tips hitting a taxi, before it smashed into the water.

TransAsia ATR 72-600 clipping an elevated motorway and hitting a taxi before crashing into the Keelung River . Rescuers have continued to scour the crash site and recovered five more bodies today, according to the Taipei City Fire Department. Three people remain missing. The airline said it had cancelled dozens of flights to accommodate the requirement by Taiwan's Civil Aeronautics Administration that all 71 of its ATR pilots be retested. Preliminary investigations indicate the pilots of Wednesday's doomed flight shut off a running engine of the ATR 72 after its other engine went idle, a move that aviation experts said was an error. 'It's a mistake,' said John M. Cox, a former US Airways pilot and now head of a safety-consulting company. 'There are procedures that pilots go through — safeguards — when you're going to shut down an engine, particularly close to the ground. Why that didn't occur here, I don't know.' Local prosecutors have said they will look into the possibility of 'professional error.' Thomas Wang, head of Taiwan's Aviation Safety Council, said Saturday that it was too early to reach conclusions about any pilot error. Pratt & Whitney Canada, the plane's engine maker, and the safety council have begun to examine both of the aircraft's engines, a process that can take four months, Mr Wang said. The plane crashed with 53 passengers and five crew, killing 38 people and leaving 15 injured and five missing . Divers prepare to get into the Keelung River. TransAsia's 71 pilots are currently being retested . Divers on boats are still looking for five missing passengers three days after the horrific crash . Preliminary investigations indicate the pilots of Wednesday's doomed flight shut off a running engine of the ATR 72 after its other engine went idle, which was a mistake . Fifteen people were rescued with injuries after the accident, which was captured in a dramatic dashboard camera video that showed the aircraft banking steeply and scraping a highway overpass before it hurtled into the water. With warmer temperatures, divers on Saturday were able to retrieve more bodies, which were found hundreds of meters downriver from the crash site. One body turned up near the shore, and others were submerged in mud, said You Chia-yi, a command post chief with the fire department. Family members of those still missing have given up hope, said Lee Hung Shu-ying, a Tzu Chi Foundation volunteer who talked to numerous relatives Saturday. 'They know it's not possible (to survive) with the weather being so cold,' she said.

"Uber says it's introducing two new safety features for riders in India in response to concerns about safety that followed a passenger reporting she had been raped by a driver. The San Francisco taxi alternative company says it will launch a 'panic button' in its ride-hailing app that allows riders to notify the police in case of an emergency, and a 'safety net' feature that will allow users to share trip details and their location with as many as five other people. Uber says it is also creating a local team that will respond to reports by riders and will get a notification when the panic button is pressed. Features: Uber says it will launch a 'panic button' in its ride-hailing app that allows riders to notify the police in case of an emergency, and a 'safety net' feature that will allow users to share trip details and their location with as many as five other people . Protests: Here, demonstrators hold signs as they protest the rape of an Uber passenger by a driver in New Delhi . The company says the new features will be available Wednesday. Uber did not say if the new features will be available in other countries, but said in an email that it will have more updates in the coming months. Uber, valued at $40 billion, lets passengers summon cars through an app in more than 250 cities around the world. It faces multiple legal and regulatory challenges as it expands in the United States and abroad. The Times of India reports that the new safety features are in response to the bans and threatened bans  by transportation department's in India and other countries. Mumbai's transportation department held multiple meetings with Uber officials to discuss safety measures, the Times reports, the meetings were prompted by an allegation made by an Uber passenger who said she was raped by a driver in New Delhi in December. She sued the company in January. Uber: Uber, valued at $40 billion, lets passengers summon cars through an app in more than 250 cities around the world . Taxi Drivers: Here, Taxi drivers carry a banner during a strike action in protest of unlicensed taxi-type-services in central Madrid in June 2014 . Department officials said that Uber failed to implement the discussed safety measures, including the 'panic button' and the 'safety net' feature, by the Jan. 15 deadline. Department officials also said they were not happy with Uber representative's responses when discussing safety measures, according to the TOI. Uber may challenge the ban in court, holding that the company is simply a 'technology platform' and not a taxi operator. 'We do not hire or employ drivers and so cannot be treated on a par with cab operators like Meru and TabCab,' an Uber official said. 'We also do not own cabs. We simply function as an aggregator and facilitate cabs for customers of our app.' But department officials said that because the company accepts requests directly from passengers and provides them with cabs, along with accepting fares online, it is the company's responsibility to 'ensure that the driver or owner follows rules, and ensure adequate measures for passenger safety.' Supporters: Here demonstrators in Germany hold signs supporting online ride-sharing apps . Blockage: Taxi drivers and their supporters stage Uber protest in Brazil with partial road blockage in June 2014 . The lawsuit alleges Uber isn't doing enough to keep passengers safe, and Uber may also face charges if Indian prosecutors believe it misrepresented the safety of its services. The company says it plans to improve its safety programs in 2015 and is looking for new ways to screen drivers. In India, Uber has been banned in New Delhi, the southern technology hub of Hyderabad, and the entire southern state of Karnataka. On its blog, Uber said the idea of a physical panic button wasn't feasible because it doesn't own the cabs. It added that buttons would be vulnerable to wear and tear and said that if it and other operators were forced to put buttons in cars, passengers might get confused in an emergency. Uber also said that the company does not own cars or employ drivers, instead, it partners with independent contractors licensed by the government and physical buttons would 'cause confusion.' 'Imagine you enter the vehicle of a driver who works on four platforms,'  the company said. 'His/ her car will need to have four physical panic buttons. 'In a situation of distress the rider would have to pick the correct operator’s panic button to be able to get help on time. That’s 25 percent chance of success; and a decision that has to be made and executed in a split-second, if at all.' Uber said it would support physical panic buttons if the owner of the vehicle were responsible for installing them and if the button called the police directly.","Uber says it's introducing two new safety features for riders in India in response to concerns about safety that followed a passenger reporting she had been raped by a driver .

"The brain damaged 16-year-old girl who miraculously survived a deadly axe-attack which killed three of her family has regained consciousness. Marli van Breda has recovered the ability to blink in response to questions which police believe  could be vital to finding the killers. Attackers left the South African teenager bleeding to death on the balcony of her family's home in Stellenbosch after cutting her throat and inflicting 'severe' head injuries, the Times reports. Ms Breda's mother Teresa, 54, was found dead on the balcony and police discovered her deceased father Martin, 55, and brother Rudi, 22, in a bedroom. Her other brother Henri, 20, escaped with light injuries and rang the police to report the deaths at his home - around 30 miles east of Cape Town on January 27. An audio recording of the five-minute phonecall, obtained by eNews Channel Africa, seems to reveal Henri van Breda 'giggling' as he explains the details of the bloody attack. Scroll down for video . Awake: Marli van Breda (pictured), who survived the deadly axe-attack at her family home, has regained consciousness . Split apart: Henri van Breda (back left) escaped the attack while his father Martin, 55 (back right), mother Teresa, 54 (front right), and brother Rudi, 22 (back centre) were killed. Marli, 16 (front left), suffered severe head and throat injuries . Chilling: An audio recording between Henri (right, pictured with brother Rudi) and emergency services after his family were hacked to death with an axe, revealed the 20-year-old appeared to giggle during the call . Survivor: The attackers left Marli (pictured) with a slit throat and 'severe' head injuries on the balcony of her home in Stellenbosch - 30 miles east of Cape Town . 'What kind of injuries are there?' a woman can be heard asking Henri, who responds: 'my family and me were attacked by a guy with an axe.' When asked if they were unconscious, he responded, 'yes, and bleeding from the head', before what sounds like a faint chuckle is heard. A cleaner who worked for one of the van Breda's neighbours saw the young man, covered in blood, using his phone outside the house shortly after the attack. The young man's mental health has been under speculation since Monday when News24 reported he had undergone brain scans at an Australian hospital in 2014. However the results were revealed to have been negative and no further testing occurred. The Times reports his uncle Her Breda, who is caring for the 20-year-old, says his nephew is heart-broken. He denied rumours the police wanted to keep him away from a private memorial service held for his deceased family - insisting he was simply hidden from the media's gaze. Mr Breda added: 'For obvious reasons Henri is very heartbroken, and we will support him as the family. 'We as a family are here for him, we will not disappoint him... I promise Henri I won't drop him.' No one has been charged over the attack on the family and Marli is believed to be in a stable condition in hospital - but both family and friends have been barred from her bedside. She is understood to have undergone brain surgery after the attack and is being closely monitored by doctors, while police provide round-the-clock guard. Her uncle Her Breda said: 'I received a call this morning and they were asking for permission to move her from intensive care unit into a bigger ward, where they will start with physical training. 'What happened was something we had not envisaged, but it is in God's hands.' Devastated friends who knew the family in Australia paid tribute to the axe attack victims last week. Deceased: Martin (left) and wife Theresa (right) both died at their home in Stellenbosch - around 30 miles east of Cape Town . Brothers: Rudi (pictured left and right) has been remembered by friends as a keen sportsman. His younger brother Henri is currently living with his uncle Her after suffering light injuries . The family were based in Perth and the Sunshine Coast in Australia, before returning to South Africa in mid-2014. Rudi's friends have been leaving tributes on social media, with his university friend Afif Norzal saying: 'You are a true blue genuine mate my friend. 'At times when I didn't have anyone to talk to, you would definitely make me feel the most welcome... I will always love you.' Family friend Retha Dutton said Rudi was visiting his parents and siblings before he returned to university for the final year of his Masters of Engineering. Mr Norzal told Daily Mail Australia in an interview: 'He was one of those guys - me being from a different culture - he was one of the first friends who genuinely connected with me. 'He was one of those people when he talked to you, you genuinely knew this guy wanted to be your mate. He was a really chilled and laidback person. He never stressed about anything.' A spokesman for the University of Melbourne released a statement saying: 'A Dean's honours list member for Science in 2011, Rudi was a keen sportsman and was highly regarded amongst his peers as a good-natured and friendly person, someone who was always willing to lend a hand and help out younger students.' Henri returned to South Africa with his parents in mid-2014. He had been living at Trinity College where his brother was staying while studying at the University of Melbourne in 2013. Both attended Scotch College in Perth. Ms Dutton told Daily Mail Australia: 'Teresa was a lovely mother... She was so happy all her children were with her, the boys had came from Australia (to visit). 'Henri moved back to South Africa in the middle of last year and he stayed with his family. She loved having him with her. She always used to tell me how wonderful it was.' Her husband Martin was the managing director of Engel and Voelkers Australia, an international property firm which has offices in Perth and Queensland. Friends described him as a 'great man' with a bright future ahead of him. Peter Armitage tweeted: '(He) was going to change SA (South Africa)... Folks, live for today. Tell people you love them today.' Mr Armitage said Martin was the founder of Netstar and Woodhill College. Martin's golf club also paid their 'deepest condolences' to the family on Twitter. Paul Freney, a friend and colleague of Martin's at Engel and Voelker,  told Daily Mail Australia he and his wife Teresa were committed parents to their three children. 'Committed parents' The van Breda family had just moved back to South Africa in June after six years in Perth, Western Australia . Popular: Rudi Van Breda was popular with his friends at Trinity College and the University of Melbourne . Separated siblings: Rudi (left) was killed during the attack,while Marli (right) remains in a critical but stable condition in a South African hospital . He said: 'I heard about it yesterday. A mate of mine rang me up and I nearly fell off my chair. 'They were very nice people. Martin loved his rugby. He was an avid Force supporter from Western Australia. We used to go to the rugby together, he loved his golf.' 'Teresa... looked after the business of running the home and all that sort of stuff, and I imagine had a fair bit to do.' 'He was a very intelligent man and he was obviously very wealthy, had a lot of money, but it was all earned through his own endeavours.' The van Breda family spent several years living in the Perth suburb of Claremont. Around 2012 they moved to the Sunshine Coast, where Engels and Volker had an office. Ms Dutton, whose daughter is close friends with Marli, said she last saw the family on January 2 in South Africa. She said they were a 'very, very happy family'. A close family friend described the van Breda's as 'like a perfect family' The van Breda family lived on the estate of the De Zalze Golf Club (pictured) about 50km east of Cape Town . Marli was enrolled at Matthew Flinders Anglican College at Buderim while she was in Year 9. A school spokesman said the community was 'very sad to hear the tragic news'. 'Our thoughts and prayers are with Marli, her family and those who love her,' the spokesman said. She is currently a student at Somerset College in South Africa. The school's headmistress Meg Fargher, described the Year 11 student as a  'lovely, popular, clever girl' whose parents were very involved in the school, news24 reported. Both schools are providing access to counsellors for students. Emergency medical services spokesman Robert Daniels told reporters it was obvious that the victims were attacked with an axe.

Forensics expert retrieves a flashlight from a police vehicle at the upmarket De Zalze housing estate in Stellenbosch, South Africa, where three members of the van Breda family were killed, and two injured. 'What I can say is they were not shot, the patients were axed,' Mr Daniels told the Cape Times. 'The daughter was rushed to hospital with severe head trauma and a severed jugular. He said Henri was treated at the scene for minor bruises on his arms. Family friend Alexander Boshoff, 19, described the Van Bredas' as a 'typical happy family', according to South African news reports. 'Our families often spent holidays together. We have known each other for years,' he said. Mr Boshoff said the family moved around a lot due to Martin's work but the boys never complained and then added that they were 'like a perfect family'.

"Pope Francis has ordered 300 umbrellas left behind by tourists to be distributed to Rome's homeless to get them through a spate of unusually wet weather. The umbrellas had been left behind by tourists visiting the Vatican museums, Sistine Chapel and St Peter's Basilica. On Friday the Vatican also formally opened new facilities in St. Peter's Square where homeless people will be offered free showers, toiletries, shaves and haircuts. Pope Francis has ordered 300 umbrellas left behind by tourists to be distributed to the homeless of Rome to get them through a spate of unusually rainy weather - he is known for his acts of charity towards the poor . A woman stands on a bridge over the Tiber river in Rome after the river's water level rose following heavy rains yesterday. The city has suffered violent winds, heavy snowfall and torrential rains in the last week . The head of the pope's charity office, Monsignor Konrad Krajewski, said 300 umbrellas left behind by tourists at Vatican museums have been distributed in recent days. The showers have been installed in a public lavatory block behind marble columns in St Peter's Square. Monsignor Krajewski came up with the idea of building the showers after a homeless man he had invited to dinner told him he couldn't come as he 'stunk' - and told him that while it was relatively easy to find places to eat, it was difficult to find places to wash. Barbers and hairdressers will visit the facilities and donate their services for free on Mondays, the day their shops are traditionally closed in Italy. The showers will be open every day except Wednesday, when the square is crowded with people for the pope's general audience. The bathrooms were made with hi-tech, easy-to-clean materials to ensure proper hygiene, the Vatican said in a statement. The initiative is being funded by donations and sales of papal parchments by Monsignor Krajewski's office. The bathroom for the homeless in the Vatican - people will be offered showers, toiletries, shaves and haircuts . Pope Francis, who was known as the 'slum bishop' in his native Buenos Aires because of his frequent visits to shantytowns, has made caring for the poor a major concern for his papacy. He has stepped up the role of the Vatican 'elmosiniere' as part of his insistence that the church should look out for the poorest in society. In addition to small acts of charity, Monsignor Krajewski's office handed out 400 sleeping bags to the homeless over Christmas and distributed 1,600 phone cards to new migrants on the island of Lampedusa. Each 'homeless pilgrim', as the Vatican calls the clients to the facilities, will receive a kit including a towel, change of underwear, soap, deodorant, toothpaste, razor and shaving cream..","Pope Francis has ordered lost brollies to be handed out to city's homeless .

"A windy storm sweeping down the West Coast knocked down trees, ripped through freeway and street signs, delayed hundreds of flights and knocked out power for thousands of people in California and Nevada. Up to 10 inches of rain is expected this weekend in parts of the drought-stricken region, but the rainfall won't make a significant dent in California's historic drought. Still, the storm is a major change after six dry weeks in the Bay Area. For the first time in recorded history, there was no measurable rainfall in downtown San Francisco in January, when winter rains usually come. Scroll down for video . Storm: A windy storm sweeping down the West Coast knocked down trees, ripped through freeway and street signs, delayed hundreds of flights and knocked out power for thousands of people in California and Nevada . Forecast: Sunday's forecast shows more rain and snow in San Francisco with snow in some surrounding areas . SUV: Here, an Oregon woman looks at her crushed SUV after a tree fell on the vehicle as Oregon had up to two inches of rain and 55 mph winds . Flooding: As well as 55 mph winds, Oregon saw flooding during the damaging storm . It would take 150 percent of the average rainfall for California to recover from the dry period, state water resource officials say. But snow is more important than rain because snowpack supplies about a third of the water needed by residents, agriculture and industry. About 26 miles west of Seattle, an overflowing river inundated at least a half dozen homes on the Olympic Peninsula. Rescuers went door to door in Brinnon to check homes on a road partially blocked by a mudslide, Jefferson County Emergency Management spokeswoman Keppie Keplinger said. Rainfaill: It would take 150 percent of the average rainfall for California to recover from the dry period, state water resource officials say . Warnings: Regions in the north west are on flood and wind watch with some on high wind and flood warning . Floods: As much as 7 inches of rain have fallen over 24 hours on the east side of the Olympics where the Duckabush River is flooding the town of Brinnon (photographed) Three people were rescued from a flooded pickup truck Friday morning, but none was injured, she said. The threat of landslides will persist into the weekend, and weather officials warn of flooding in several rivers in western Washington. Oregon also saw flooding on roadways. In the Sierra Nevada spanning California and Nevada, strong winds blinded drivers, causing multiple car crashes. The wind snapped massive trees, closed ski resorts around Lake Tahoe and knocked out power to thousands. A 134 mph gust recorded early Friday near the Mount Rose Ski Resort southeast of Reno led the facility and two others to close. At least a dozen people were hurt in multiple crashes on Nevada highways. Threat: The threat of landslides will persist into the weekend, and weather officials warn of flooding in several rivers in western Washington . Sandbags: North of San Francisco, businesses in Marin, Napa, Solano, and Sonoma counties stacked sandbags to prepare for possible flash flooding from swollen waterways as rain started falling in the North Bay . No deaths were reported, but nine people were hospitalized in a crash on a stretch of U.S. Highway 95A that involved at least eight vehicles. Three other people were hospitalized with minor injuries after five cars crashed on U.S. 395 north of Reno near the California line. In the San Francisco Bay Area, power lines were snapped by falling trees and the wind ripped through freeway and street signs. More than 60,000 people lost power. By Friday evening, 9,000 customers remained without power, Pacific Gas & Electric said. North of San Francisco, businesses in Marin, Napa, Solano, and Sonoma counties stacked sandbags to prepare for possible flash flooding from swollen waterways as rain started falling in the North Bay. Winds of up to 15 mph were recorded east of the city Friday morning, and the blustery weather knocked down trees and caused power outages, the National Weather Service said. San Francisco International Airport saw delays of up to 90 minutes and about 175 flights canceled Friday. Warning: The storm is expected to drop rain through Sunday, and the National Weather Service issued a heavy-rain, high wind-gust and flash-flood warning for the region through Monday . Additional Rain: Areas of northern California are expected to see two to three inches of rain through the weekend . The storm is expected to drop rain through Sunday, and the National Weather Service issued a heavy-rain, high wind-gust and flash-flood warning for the region through Monday. The heaviest downpours are forecast in the North Bay, where up to 7 inches of rain is expected to overwhelm waterways and roadway-drainage systems, leading to flash flooding. Urban areas could see up to 4 inches of moisture, while Marin and Sonoma counties could see 10 inches through Sunday, weather service lead forecaster Roger Gass said. Though the storm, dubbed a 'Pineapple Express' has caused substantial damage, some South Sacramento residents are happy for the rain. Delays: Flights were delayed in San Francisco and a wind advisory was issued Friday morning as the powerful storm rolled into the Bay Area . Clouds: This NOAA satellite image taken Friday, Feb. 6, 2015 at 1:00 p.m. EST, shows a line of clouds entering into the Pacific Northwest and northern California as a storm moves into the area, with rain . One resident told KCRA that she welcomes the rain, because the area needs it. 'I love it, we need more of it,' another said. 'California's in a state of drought right now and we need all we can get.' Rain has been nearly nonexistent across much of California and Nevada since Dec. 20, halting hopes for the drought to improve. California's second snow survey this winter found the Sierra Nevada snowpack is far below normal after a dry, unusually warm January. A greater snowpack translates to more water for California reservoirs to meet demand in summer and fall. Water resources managers said heavy rain and cooler temperatures in the next three months would be required for the snowpack to build and give Californians hope for beginning to recover from the drought this year.","A windy storm sweeping down the West Coast knocked down trees, ripped through freeway and street signs, delayed hundreds of flights and knocked out power for thousands of people in California and Nevada .

"An Australian traveller took to the streets of America to film foreigners having a crack at guessing the meaning behind a string of Aussie slang - and the results are hilarious. From bloke and dunny to esky and bogan – it’s among some classic words that appear to be a mystery to our foreigner friends when Kieran Murray, from Brisbane in Queensland, put them to the test. The footage, uploaded to his YouTube account, shows the filmmaker asking a number of people on the streets of Los Angeles in the United States what a ‘dunny’ means, with one man responding: ‘A dunny is a little boy’. Scroll down for video . An Australian traveller took to the streets of America to film foreigners having a crack at Aussie slang . Looking puzzled and confused, the people are heard throwing out clueless guesses as they stare blankly into the camera or at Murray. When Murray asked if they knew what esky meant - a portable insulated container for keeping food or drink cool – one man responded: ‘Definitely a fine Eskimo lady’. ‘Like a fat person,’ one girl suggested. Another word Murray said was bogan - an uncouth or unsophisticated person, regarded as being of low social status – one man said: ‘Bogan is a cloth made from a fur of a badger.’ When asked what a 'dunny' is - one man suggested it was an expression on a person . This woman was asked what 'bloke' meant. When she found out it means 'man' - her response was hilarious . While one woman was heard wording ‘bogan’ over and over and then she pauses and looks blankly onto the ground. ‘It [bogan] sounds like awesome – like it’s bogan,’ one woman said. Murray told one man to use ‘bogan’ in a sentence – so he says: ‘You know, this guy has been acting bogan to my daughter’. It seems not everyone is on board with our Aussie McDonalds slang when asked what 'maccas' was . One man asked whether maccas was a fish? While ‘maccas’ is a term used quite frequently in Australia, most people questioned had no idea it was another word for the popular fast food giant – McDonalds. ‘Is that a fish?’ one man said. ‘Oh I immediately thought breasts – I don’t know why,’ another woman guessed. ‘Damn that girl got some nice maccas,’ one woman said. Other words that left foreigners muddled were full stop and fortnight. Most suggested it was just a term used for stopping on the road. This man was asked to give a meaning behind a 'full stop' - he suggested it meant to stop at a traffic . This woman guessed it meant woman's breasts . With hilarious results - one man thought 'fortnight' was another word for trees . When Murray said full stop was another term for ‘period’, one man said: ‘It’s a period? For like woman?’ The last word Murray dropped was ‘fortnight’ – a period of two weeks – but people were heard repeating the word, with some asking Murray to pronounce it again. ‘Kinda sounds like medieval,’ one young woman said. Many said it’s ‘the night before’ while one man suggested ‘it’s trees - some trees'.","An Australian filmmaker tested our foreigner friends on some Aussie slang .

"A teenager who beat an 88-year-old Second World War veteran to death has been jailed for 20 years. Kenan Adams-Kinard killed Delbert Belton, who was known by locals as 'Shorty' and had fought in the Battle of Okinawa in 1945, during a robbery outside a bar in Spokane, Washington, in 2013. The 17-year-old and alleged accomplice Demetruis Glenn - who is set to stand trial in March - repeatedly hit the elderly man who was just 5ft tall with a flashlight as he sat in his car. At the time the pair are said to have told their friends they attacked him during a drug deal gone wrong. Scroll down for video . Jailed: Kenan Adams-Kinard, 17, (left) killed Delbert Belton, 88, who was known by locals as 'Shorty' and had fought in the Battle of Okinawa in 1945, during a robbery outside a bar in Spokane, Washington, in 2013 . The youngster initially pleaded not guilty but changed his mind in January after telling a judge he had gone through a personal 'metamorphosis' since his arrest. According to Spokesman-Review Adams-Kinard read  a lengthy statement asking for forgiveness. He told the Belton family inside court he has grown into a better person since. 'Life is a precious gift, and to know that I have taken the life of another person has severed my spirit,' he said. 'From this day forward, I intend to turn the page and start a new chapter in my life.' Two of Mr Belton's nephews and friend Martha Denison paid tribute to the war hero during sentencing, describing him as as soft-spoken, patriotic and unfailingly kind. Ms Denison said if Adams-Kinard had been looking for money, all he had to do was ask as Shorty would have given it to him. After the incident, Glenn gave himself up immediately to the police, but Adams-Kinard went on the run for four days. The letter said that after purchasing a 'zip of crack cocaine from Shorty,' the teens 'proceeded to sock him'. Hero: Mr Belton was known by local residents as 'Shorty'. He served in Japan and was shot in the leg during the Battle of Okinawa in 1945 . Emotional: Spokane veteran Delbert Belton was buried with full military honors during a public service . Pallbearers remove Delbert Belton's casket from a hearse during the graveside service . Alleged accomplice: Demetrius Glenn, pictured being led away by an officer, has pleaded not guilty to killing the veteran and is set to face trial in March . 'I took his wallet and another ounce of crack from his pockets,' the letter said, according to the court document. 'He was unconscious so I made sure he was still breathing, and then I took off.' Adams-Kinard's mother, Tracy Adams, pleaded for mercy from Judge Annette Plese and said anyone who knew her son would describe him as 'a sweet kid'. She added that he had a 'good spirit', loved sports and went to church. The judge said it was apparent Adams-Kinard had matured since he first appeared during his time in custody. She told the court: 'You're owning up and taking accountability for your actions. That's what a man does.' He will serve his time in a juvenile detention center until he is 21. When Mr Belton was buried, hundreds gathered at Greenwood Memorial Terrace to bid farewell. Uniformed soldiers joined the mourners and the Reversand Homer Todd told how Mr Belton had fought bravely and was shot in the leg in the Battle of Okinawa.

"A businessman and his son have been charged with manslaughter over the death of a teenage apprentice on their factory floor. Cameron Minshull, 16, suffered fatal head injuries after he became entangled in an industrial metal lathe in January last year, just weeks into his new job at a factory in Bury, Greater Manchester. Zaffar Hussain, 59 and son Akbar, 35, have personally been charged with unlawful killing by gross negligence, and their company, Huntley Mount Engineering Ltd, has been charged with corporate manslaughter. Charged: Zaffar Hussain (left) and Akbar Hussain (right),  outside Bury Magistrates Court where they were charged with manslaughter over the death of their 16-year-old apprentice Cameron Minshull last year . Cameron, who had just started work at the factory on December 3, 2012, was airlifted to nearby Wythenshawe Hospital, but was pronounced dead shortly after his arrival. Mr Hussain Sr., director of Huntley Mount, and his son, a supervisor of the company, were ordered to face trial by judge and jury at Bury Magistrates court on Tuesday. Huntley Mount Engineering Ltd is charged with corporate manslaughter by failing to maintain a lathe in a safe condition which amounts to a gross breach of duty of care. It is also accused of failing to ensure the health, safety and welfare of employees. Prosecuting Miss Elizabeth Reid said: 'These matters arise out of the death of a 16-year-old apprentice at a premises ran by the two men. 'Hussain Sr. is the sole director and the second defendant is a supervisor at the company which had a very small workforce at the time of the death. Tragedy: Cameron Minshull, 16, suffered fatal head injuries after he became entangled in an industrial metal lathe in January, 2013, just over a month after he started working at Huntley Mount Engineering Ltd, in Bury . Scene: Zaffar Engineering, located on the former site of Huntley Mount Engineering Ltd in Bury, where Cameron Minshull was working as an apprentice when the accident took place . 'The company is charged with corporate manslaughter and the two defendants are charged with manslaughter by gross negligence. 'The company is facing offences under the health and safety at work act of failing to ensure the safety of an employee. These are matters which can only be dealt with at the crown court. Cameron, the oldest of four siblings, had recently left Castlebrook and Radcliffe Riverside high schools in Bury. At the time of the tragedy his devastated family said his death would leave 'a big hole in many people's hearts'. Charged: Akbar Hussain and his father Zaffar have been charged with unlawful killing by gross negligence, and their company charged with corporate manslaughter, and will appear in crown court later this month . His mother Joanne Hill said: 'We have lost a very precious part of our lives and there are no words to describe how we are feeling. 'Cameron was a much-loved son, brother, nephew, grandson and great-grandson and a friend to many. He will leave a big hole in many people's hearts.' Lime People Training Solutions Ltd., which place apprentices with employers and had organised Cameron's placement with the Hussains, had been summonsed for failing to ensure the health and safety of a person other than an employee. However, no representative for the company turned up for the hearing. The charges follow an investigation by Greater Manchester Police and the Health and Safety Executive. The Hussains were granted bail pending a preliminary hearing at Manchester Crown Court on November 12.

"Researchers may have finally found a way to save the lives of hundreds of millions of birds killed every year when they fly into transparent glass. In an underground tunnel at the Bronx Zoo there are already live tests underway to save the feathered friends with new technology. A panel with bird-friendly glass using white vertical stripes to signal its presence to birds is set up next to the plain type of transparent glass birds don't detect until it's too late. A new type of glass marked with white stripes could act as a warning sign for birds in flight . In a test observed by The New York Times, a yellow-rumpled warbler flew into the tunnel but managed to avoid the safety glass. It's estimated between 355 million and 988 million birds are killed eery year from striking buildings in mid-flight. The New York City Audubon, the American Bird Conservancy, and Fordham University are all collaborating on the research. A fine-mesh net is hung before the panels at the Bronx Zoo to ensure no birds are actually harmed in flight. Another new type of glass, Ornilux, has shown promising results in appearing plainly in avian vision. That glass is coated with a patterned, ultraviolet reflective coating that birds can see but which is all but invisible to the human eye. Glass that appears in avian vision could save the lives of hundreds of millions of birds every year . The tests also involve spreading lines and visual cues out to see how far they can be from each other before they no longer alert birds to the danger. William Haffey, an ecology student at Fordham University, told the paper of record that the lines seem to work best at four inches apart. Ideally they find a happy medium to alert birds but that can still find favor with designers and architects. 'We're . going to see how far we can stretch the limits,' Haffey said. 'The . fewer lines you have on the glass, the happier the architects are going . to be.'","Between 355 million and 988 million birds are killed eery year from striking buildings in mid-flight .

"Since ousting a group of parents at her daughter's school for requesting donations towards expensive birthday gifts Myleene Klass has been the subject of playground chatter across the UK. And while some may have criticised her choice to upload a photograph of the email exchange to social media, the radio DJ says she has been secretly inundated with messages of support. It comes after the mother-of-two was harangued by angry mothers at the gates of her daughter's north London school yesterday. Outraged parents were seen shouting across the playground: 'Why did you do it Myleene,' seemingly irate with her decision to share the conversation with her thousands of fans. Scroll down for video . Myleene Klass, (pictured yesterday, left) said she has been inundated with messages of support since revealing the exchange with mothers at her daughter's school. The 36-year-old has two daughters, Ava and Hero (together, right) But some have been secretly glad to see the issue raised publically, Miss Klass, 36, said today. 'My phone hasn't stopped ringing since. The reactions have been mostly positive, with lots of parents laughing it off and thanking me for speaking out. 'When the email was initially sent out, at least 10 parents ""secretly"" got in touch to say they wished they too could confront the situation,' Miss Klass wrote in an article for the Daily Telegraph. Far from trying to embarrass the women involved, the classical singer said she was trying to 'put the fun back into birthdays' by posting the exchange on Instagram. The conversation was is in fact a year old, she said, and was only used after the issue of how much should be spent on a child's birthday was raised in her close circle of friends. 'Though they were old exchanges, I've received countless emails like this since. Mockery: Ms Klass posted the text of two emails she received from fellow parents, as well as her response . The 36-year-old Classic FM presenter said she did not want to embarrass the mothers involved so uploaded an old email exchange in which all the names had been changed . Miss Klass added she had been trying to 'put the fun back into birthdays' when she shared her joking response in which she told mothers she was planning to buy Ava, 7, (right) a unicorn . 'I didn't want to embarrass the parents involved, so I used some old emails that were less recognisable and changed the names of everyone involved,' she added. In the emails, the parents of two girls asked others at the school whether they would like to contribute £10 each for a Kindle and a desk as birthday gifts. Mothers were invited to place the cash in envelopes and in their own children's schoolbags to pass along. Responding to the request, Miss Klass poked fun at the entire exchange by joking she was raising money to buy her daughter Ava a unicorn. 'I'd like a Ferrari and Leonardo DiCaprio, so by all means, do feel obligated to contribute to this too,' she added. While social media was abuzz with messages of support, others failed to see the funny side. One mother at the school described her actions as 'a cheap shot,' while another said the celebrity had alienated herself. 'She has betrayed our confidences and belittled us so publicly. Lots of people have complained,' the woman, who did not want to be named, said. Others wrote letters of complaint to the school's headteacher.

"British parents are being left out in the cold when it comes to buying Frozen merchandise after it emerged retailers are charging them up to twice as much for toys than in the United States. The hugely popular Disney franchise was responsible for last Christmas's most popular toy- the Snow Glow Elsa- and demand for Frozen dolls, games and clothing shows no sign of abating. But it was revealed today that if Brits want to pick up the sell-out doll, which can move, light up and play Frozen's hit song Let it Go- they are expected to pay more than £12 extra than their American counterparts. We have compared prices for Disney's Frozen merchandise and found that British parents are being charged almost double the US prices for toys . The toy is on sale on Toys R Us' UK website for £34.99 but across the Atlantic, the same doll is selling  for a bargain £22.97. An Olaf pull-apart figure is more than twice the price in the UK at £14.99 than in the US at £6.56. Elsa's Musical Snow Wand is also half the cost in the States where shoppers are charged just £7.87 compared to £12.99 in the UK. But the biggest saving can be made on the Frozen Crystal Kingdom Vanity Unit which is a staggering £23.89 more expensive to buy in Britain than abroad at £59.99 compared to £36.10. The Consumer Action Group have slammed the pricing as unfair as British are expected to pay more for the same goods as their counterparts. Popular princess: The Snow Glow Elsa (pictured) was the most popular toy last Christmas but will cost more than £12 more to buy in the UK than in America . The hugely popular Disney film following snow queen Elsa and her sister Anna, has created a huge demand for merchandise . A Toys R Us spokesman told the Sun: 'Margins in the UK and US tend to be the same but it is not unusual to find manufacturers having different cost prices. 'Some of this will be down to different rates of VAT and taxes between the UK and US.' Sales of Frozen toys hit an all-time high in the run-up to Christmas outstripping the Buzz Lightyear dolls that set a record after Toy Story was released. Even now the demand for Frozen merchandise shows no signs of slowing down. In fact, sales have increased this week as pictures from the seven minute short follow-up film Frozen Fever were released.

The film's storyline is inspired by Hans Christian Andersen’s fairy tale The Snow Queen and tells how a fearless princess sets off on an epic journey alongside a rugged iceman, his loyal pet reindeer and a snowman to find her sister, Anna, who has become trapped in a land of eternal winter. Frozen, which subverts the fairy-tale premise that a princess's primary purpose should be to bag a handsome prince, picked up two Oscars for best song and best animated feature. But even more startling than its critical acclaim was its commercial success. It overtook Toy Story 3 to become the biggest grossing animated film of all time earlier this year with ticket sales of more than £1billion. Meanwhile, its soundtrack- encapsulated by Elsa's show-stopping, infuriatingly catchy ballad Let It Go- stayed at the top of the American Billboard charts for 13 consecutive weeks and went onto become a social media phenomenon.","British shoppers are paying more than double for Frozen toys compared to US .

Children with Netherton Syndrome, a painful skin condition, have a missing gene, and trials are under way of a treatment that replaces it. A small section of skin is taken from the patient, and manipulated in a lab where a gene containing a protein is added. The protein promotes stronger, healthier skin and, it is hoped, will boost protein levels throughout the body. Netherton Syndrome affects one in every 800,000 people, with a handful of cases in the UK. Babies born with it often have red, ‘scalded-looking’ skin that peels easily. One sufferer in ten does not live to see his or her first birthday. The condition also affects the immune system and hair growth, resulting in it being fragile and slow-growing. Children with Netherton Syndrome are more susceptible to dehydration, infection and allergies, and are smaller and lighter than healthy children. Now doctors at Great Ormond Street and Guy’s and St Thomas’ Hospitals in London, who are behind the trials, say the graft could bring relief for those with the disorder. ‘Netherton Syndrome has a huge impact on people’s lives,’ says Dr Jemima Mellerio, a consultant in the dermatology department of Great Ormond Street Hospital. ‘Skin is inflamed, sore and peeling, and you can be open to infection. If successful, the skin grafts could potentially offer the first treatment for the condition rather than just managing the symptoms.’ People with Netherton Syndrome are lacking a gene called Spink5, which contains a protein known as lekti, usually found in the skin. The protein plays an important role in the immune system by producing white blood cells called lymphocytes, which help the body respond to infection. The lifelong condition usually improves as people get older, and some drugs and regular gentle washing and moisturising can help with symptoms. Doctors at Great Ormond Street, pictured, and Guy’s and St Thomas’ Hospitals in London, say the graft could bring relief for those with Netherton Syndrome . The new graft involves taking a quarter-inch skin biopsy from the inside of the patient’s arm. This is processed in a lab where the missing gene is added. The genetically corrected skin is then grown to around the size of four postage stamps and grafted on to the patient’s thigh. The hope is that once in place, the gene will produce lekti in the grafted skin, and increase levels of it throughout the body. The protein plays a key role in the creation of the tough outer surface of the skin – the stratum corneum – which acts as a barrier between the body and the outside environment. ‘The protein strengthens the skin, effectively putting the brakes on the shedding process,’ Dr Mellerio adds. ‘In Netherton Syndrome, the skin sheds, leaving a thinner and more irritable layer exposed. This protein stops the top layer of the skin from shedding. ‘We think that production and release of lekti protein from even a small patch of skin will be beneficial for the patients, leading to increased levels of the protein throughout the body.’ The trials, which are expected to last at least two years, will first test out the treatment on adults, and later children. Gene researchers at University College London, where the Spink5 gene was first identified as the cause of Netherton Syndrome 15 years ago, are also involved in the trial.","Children with Netherton Syndrome suffer from chronic skin inflammation .

"AP McCoy, racing’s Mr Indestructible, claimed his 200th winner at Newbury on Saturday  — and then revealed he will retire by the end of the season. The 19-time champion jockey made the surprise announcement after a victory on Mr Mole that sealed the ninth double century in a remarkable career. There had already been a hint of his intention to quit at Wetherby in October when the pain of rib and  shoulder injuries meant McCoy, aged 40, was barely able to move as he rode Goodwood Mirage to victory . VIDEO Scroll down to see AP McCoy pick up his OBE in 2011 . Tony McCoy has announced he is to retire from racing at the end of the season . The racing legend after winning the Grand National at Aintree in 2010 . McCoy riding Qewy at Newbury on the day he announces his retirement . Grand National, Gold Cup, Champion Chase, Champion Hurdle, King George, Ryanair Chase, RSA Chase, Fighting Fifth Hurdle, Tingle Creek, Arkle, Welsh Grand National, Scottish Grand National, Midlands Grand National, Irish Grand National, Lexus Chase, Galway Plate. The iron man’s mask slipped and he was unable to conceal the agony. That wince at Wetherby also signalled the moment when his dream of becoming the first jockey to ride 300 winners in a season was over. The public announcement of his impending retirement came on Saturday after Mr Mole, trained by Jonjo O’Neill and owned by his boss, Irish millionaire owner JP McManus, had won the Game Spirit Chase. An emotional McCoy admitted that he had talked to McManus about ending his career — he has ridden more than 4,300 winners — last April but it was that injury blow which had finally bent, if not broken, his iron will. McCoy, who also won the opening race on Qewy, said: ‘Believe or not I spoke to JP about it in April, that it [retirement] was possible. I’ve got a real thing about going out in a blaze of glory and through the early part of the season thought that I was going to ride 300 winners. ‘Then I got injured at Worcester and went back riding after a few days in a lot of pain. It was not the brightest thing to do. But if I was going to ride 300 winners, I was going to have to keep riding. I thought I could do it and the fact it was taken away from me broke my heart. It is emotional because I am retiring from something I really like doing. That is why it is tough, but it is the right thing. McCoy announcing his retirement to the press at Newbury on Saturday afternoon . McCoy fell from his mount Goodwood Mirage at the first hurdle on the day he retired . McCoy looks emotional after announcing his impending retirement from racing . ‘Could I ride for another three or four years? I think I could. But I wanted to retire while I am champion jockey and feel I am still riding at a good level and not making a show of myself. ‘All those things were important to me. It was always going to be tough. If I rode next year there were always going to be good horses coming along that I could ride. I thought if I could ride 20 jockey championships it was a good achievement.’ I didn't expect the announcement but it also came as no surprise. It is an incredible testament to AP McCoy that he has been able to dictate when he is going to retire. It is great to have done what he has done as a jump jockey, ride and last so long, and still be in charge of his own destiny. This was a big decision and big decisions are the hard decisions, but AP has never been afraid of making them. He has been a wonderful ambassador for racing and an incredible jockey and it is both an honour and a privilege to be able to say that I have ridden with him. He was so damn good that he always made you try harder. He has set standards and records that are going to be in the history books for a long, long time. Why was he so good? He was just brilliant. But what makes Messi brilliant, what makes Ronaldo and Federer brilliant? They are all just unbelievably talented sportsmen. Although I will remember the races I lost against him more than the ones I won, I have still enjoyed every day of it. It might seem strange to say when someone is so good, but I will really miss riding against him. With that, McCoy asked to be excused. He was on the verge of tears; crying in public would have been a rare first for a man who has won everything there is to win in jump racing. The raw emotion also showed just how tough this will have been for a man who lives and breathes his sport. He acknowledged he had no idea what he will do next, although his development as an eloquent and thoughtful speaker will mean offers to work in the media are likely to flood in. That may be a more attractive route than training — something he has always shied away from — because he would always be under pressure to match his achievement in the saddle if he opted to take such a career route. The final decision to call it a day, McCoy admitted, was when he invited his agent, Dave Roberts, to dinner on Monday evening without even his wife, Channelle, knowing what was going to be discussed. Roberts, making a rare appearance on the racecourse, said he knew that the decision to retire was correct because he felt the his client was ‘at peace with decision’. He also stressed it will be ‘business as usual’ until the end of the season and McCoy is in action at Leopardstown on Sunday. But it could be significant that the jockey’s management were stressing his retirement would be by the end of the season as opposed to at the end when they issued a prepared statement.That would presumably allow McCoy to quit before the end of the campaign, with his 20th title secure, possibly after the Grand National at Aintree in April, the race he won in 2010 on Don’t Push It. McCoy said he felt he could race on for another couple of years but wanted to quit . McCoy riding Mr Mole clear to win The Betfair Price Rush Steeple Chase . McCoy admitted it was a moment he had been dreading for some time . That success catapulted him from the superstar on racing’s stage to a national sporting icon, confirmed when he was voted the BBC Sports Personality of the Year. Between now and that final ride, whenever that may be, racing will have to come to terms with losing its biggest attraction and the man many consider to be the sport’s greatest-ever jockey. The Northern Irishman began riding out for his local trainer Billy Rock at the age of 12, started as an apprentice Flat jockey with Irish trainer Jim Bolger and rode his first winner on Legal Steps at Thurles in March 1992. But his attention turned to jump racing and, having come to England to work for the late Toby Balding, he partnered his first winner on Chickabiddy at Exeter on September 7, 1994. He finished that season champion conditional jockey and he has been the champion every season since. He has won every big race in the calendar, including two Cheltenham Gold Cups with Mr Mulligan (1997) and Synchronised (2012), and dominated his sport with a ruthless streak that did not just border on obsessive — it was obsessive. McCoy lifts the trophy after winning the Grand National at Aintree Racecourse, Liverpool . McCoy celebrates winning the Johnny Henderson Grand Annual Chase Challenge Cup at Cheltenham . McCoy waves to the crowds while riding Tarquin du Seuil at the Cheltenham Races . Pain was overridden, outside distractions shunned. Failure was not considered. One of the first people to wish him well following the surprise announcement was his long-time ally and supplier of winners, retired trainer Martin Pipe, who said: ‘He was so brave, so much fun and always winning. We will miss him tremendously. He is the best jockey there has ever been.’ Richard Johnson, his greatest rival in the weighing room and now the favourite to be crowned champion next season, said: ‘There will be a few people relieved and will have a few more chances, but it’s certainly a great loss to lose him from the weighing room.’ Just over half an hour after McCoy made his retirement public, he fell at the first flight in the Betfair Hurdle. It seemed an ironic twist as race-goers digested the news. And there was more irony, because the horse was Goodwood Mirage — the source of that telling Wetherby wince.","AP McCoy has announced that he will retire at the end of the season .

"John Terry claims referees have an agenda against Chelsea after they Phil Dowd refused to award another penalty in their 5-3 defeat at Tottenham. The Chelsea skipper believes match officials are being influenced by managers and coaches criticising Jose Mourinho’s players for diving in recent weeks. Chelsea players have been cautioned four times this season for simulation and Mourinho is convinced a campaign has been started against the Barclays Premier League leaders. John Terry believes Chelsea are being ill-treated by officials wary of the Blues' reputation . Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho is adamant there is a 'clear campaign' against his side . Terry said: ‘A little bit. There has been a lot of highlights on the box and in the papers as well, which is unfair. ‘I think the refs have to come into the games with a clear mind and judge each game as it is. ‘You can’t go into a game thinking ‘someone did this, someone did that’. ‘There are reputations out there, but the referees have got to come into it with a clear mind and I think the last two games we have been denied two clear penalties.’ Chelsea are still top, despite a difficult Christmas period following a draw at Southampton and an unexpected defeat at White Hart Lane on New Year’s Day. Despite Chelsea’s second defeat of the season in the Premier League, Terry is convinced they will still go on to win the title at the end of the season. Phil Dowd (fourth left) took charge as Chelsea were beaten by Tottenham on New Year's Day . Frank Lampard scored the winner against Sunderland on New Year's Day to send Manchester City joint top . Terry added: ‘Listen, at the moment we are top of the League and we are there for a reason because we are playing some great stuff and we’ve seen us outplay a lot of side this year. ‘So at half-time we were confident we could comeback in the game. They then made it 4-1, it was then uphill from there, which is difficult. But we kept fighting and we’ll kick on and wipe this one away. ‘We soaked up a bit of play, they had some early good play. Once we got the goal, they are on the back foot and got a goal from nothing and they are back in the game. ‘We could have maybe got a pen to go two up, didn’t get it, but as I said we are disappointed with the loss, that’s clear to see from everyone’s faces and the fans as well. ‘We’ll regroup and we’ll go again, we’re playing some really good stuff as well.’ Chelsea will continue to assess goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois after he damaged fingers on his right hand during the defeat at Tottenham.","John Terry believes Chelsea are being ill-treated by official .

"Jozef Paczynski, 95, has often spoken of his years as a prisoner in Auschwitz - and the terror of cutting camp commander Rudolf Hoess's hair on an almost weekly basis . There are few people who survived more than a few months living in Auschwitz: Jozef Paczynski - who lived for four-and-a-half years within the walls of the death camp, is the exception to the rule. But in order to do so he had to take a weekly task which terrified him: become the personal barber to camp commander Rudolf Hoess, one of the most cold-blooded and sadistic mass murderers in Adolf Hitler's regime. In the years after he was rescued, he has had to face one question: why didn't he slit the throat of the man sending hundreds of thousands of innocent people to their deaths at the largest and most notorious Nazi death camp? His answer has been searingly honest: 'I thought about it. But when I realized what the consequences would be I simply could not do it.' Jozef, now 95, was just out of his teens when he arrived at the camp's notorious entrance in June 1940. He had been trying to flee Poland, to join the Polish army which was regrouping in France. He was arrested after crossing into Slovakia and was taken in the first transport to Auschwitz, becoming prisoner number 121. The camp had opened just months before, in April, and he was on the first transport with 728 other young people. Scroll down for video . Hoess - pictured second left, with, from left, Dr. Josef Mengele, Josef Kramer, the commandant of Birkenau, and an unidentified soldier - . Jozef was one of the first prisoners to arrive at Aushwtiz (pictured), and was able to get himself a job in the barbers . Because they were the first, there were managerial jobs on offer - and Jozef found a role for himself in the barbers shop, where the SS men used to get their hair cut. And then, one day, Hoess himself showed up and ordered the 'small Pole' — 'der kleine Pole' — to come to his home. It was with terror that Jozef went to the villa on the outskirts of the camp, escorted by a guard. 'Hoess' wife let me in the house,' he told an audience in Poland last month. 'My voice was shaking, my hands were shaking and my legs were shaking. 'His wife led me to the first floor and into a bathroom. There was a mirror and a chair and within a moment Hoess arrived. He didn't speak a word to me. 'But I said 'bitte schoen' to him and he sat down and I cut his hair.' In fact, Hoess would never speak a word to the man who would cut his hair until 1944. But he was soon asked to cut the hair of the commander, making regular trips to Hoess's home on the outskirts of the camp . Jozef witnessed people being rounded up and gassed, watching from the barbers - which was next door to the crematorium. Pictured: Women in Auschwitz the day it was liberated . But he obviously felt Jozef did a good job, getting him to return every seven to 10 days. Even after he was sent to Berlin, Hoess would always ask for a haircut from 'der kleine Pole' when he arrived back at Auschwitz. All the time, though, Jozef knew what was happening in the camp. He had been told, when he arrived, that the guards didn't expect people to live more than three months - and even less for Jews. More horrifying for Jozef, who had been a captain in the Polish army, was the fact the barbers shop was next door to the crematorium. He has, in the years since, described watching the guards at work - pushing the herded people into the cell, before one of them began pouring powder into an opening. Tellingly, he was wearing a gas mask. Speaking in Germany 10 years ago, he recalled: 'Although the walls were very thick, I could hear loud screams from there. It lasted 15 minutes, then after, complete silence. 'Two engines were put to work on the sidewalk at the fullest so the screams would not be heard.' Yet still, he did not move to kill the evil commander ordering the deaths of hundreds of thousands of innocent people. He decided not to kill Hoess - pictured here after he was captured following the war - because he thought the implications for his family and the camp would be too severe . Ten years ago, he elaborated on his reasons why. 'All my family and half of the camp would be killed,' CNN reported him as saying. 'And of course I realised if this silent son of a bitch would go, there will be another man who will take his place.' But Jozef was also privy to another side of the murderous camp commander - who was, he believed, 'an ideal father and an ideal husband'. 'He was a man of very few words,' Jozef said. 'And he would never actually hit a prisoner.' Jozef eventually left the confines of Auschwitz on January 18, 1945 - moved out by the Nazis days before the Soviet army liberated the camp. He had to wait to be freed - finally being liberated by U.S. soldiers in Germany. As for Hoess, he was tried by Polish authorities after the fall of Germany. He was found guilty of murder after a year on the run, and hung next to the crematorium where he had put so many to death in April 1947. Jozef - pictured here next to Eva Mozes Kor, 81, a Jewish survivor of experiments by the sadistic German doctor Josef Mengele - was eventually marched out of the camps by the Nazis in January 1945, days before the soviets arrived to free the remaining prisoners .","Jozef Paczynski survived four-and-a-half years in the Nazi death camp .

"A Florida man who was caught on tape having sex with his family's chihuahua has been jailed. Marc Ramon Gonzalez, 61, from Palm Beach County, was found out by his wife after she looked at security camera footage of her husband abusing the pet near the patio door. He pleaded guilty to animal cruelty and sexual activity with an animal and received 100 days in jail along with 12 months' probation, the county clerk's office told Daily Mail Online. Scroll down for video . Marc Ramon Gonzalez, 61, from Palm Beach County, will serve 100 days in prison for animal cruelty and sexual activity with an animal . Gonzalez shared his Wellington home with his wife and three young children and would often go out into their backyard . A police report about the incident, in November 2013, included testimony from a dog expert who said that the dog was constantly in an uncomfortably submissive posture, with his head and ears down while Gonzalez abused him and touched himself. Gonzalez's wife then rushed outside and confronted her husband. The animal, which bore marks of physical trauma afterwards, tried to escape multiple times unsuccessfully and 'did not like what was happening'. Though Florida did not have a law against bestiality for many years, sexual activity with an animal and animal cruelty are both first degree misdemeanors (dog similar to the one abused) The man originally pleaded not guilty before striking a deal with prosecutors. Sexual activity with an animal is a first degree misdemeanor in Florida, punishable by up to a year in prison or a $1,000 fine. Animal cruelty is also a first degree misdemeanor and punishable by a year in prison or up to a $5,000 fine. Cruelty that 'results in the cruel death, or excessive or repeated infliction of unnecessary pain or suffering' is a third degree felony and punishable by up to five years in prison. 'We wish there was stronger laws. We wish people would immediately go to jail and stay there,' Capt. Dave Walesky, Palm Beach County Animal Care and Control, told WPEC. 'It just doesn't make sense why people do things like that. There's no reason to justify something like that,' he said. Florida is the number one state for animal abuse crimes, according to Pet-Abuse.com. The state officially passed a law banning bestiality in 2011, after many years without one. As of early last year 12 states and the District of Columbia did not have specific laws against bestiality, according to AL.com. However, many cases of bestiality are prosecuted under animal cruelty charges.","Marc Gonzalez, 61, from Palm Beach County, to spend 100 days in jail .

"A family has spoken of their shock after spotting an animal more at home in the rainforests of Brazil than their garden in an English market town. Anna Shearer first noticed the unusual creature – thought to be a South American coati -  being chased by the family dogs round their garden in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, this afternoon. At first, she thought her pets - a Springer Spaniel and Jack Russel - were playing with another dog. But then she realised the animal was a little more unusual. Scroll down for video . Anna Shearer was surprised to see the creature in her back garden on the banks of the Thames in Marlow, Buckinghamshire . She first noticed it when her dogs began going 'mental', chasing the animal around the garden . 'I thought they were playing with a baby bear,' she said. 'They were going mental - I think they probably would have tried to eat it if it was any smaller.' Anna, 23, called for help from her father Dave, and the two rushed out into the garden - just in time for the bear-like creature to disappear up the tree. 'It shot up a really tall tree,' she said. They quickly called for reinforcements - and nearby animal charity Tiggy Winkles sent out a volunteer to help try to catch the 'bear'. But even with the help of a net, they were unable to catch the animal - which fled towards the banks of the Thames. 'They said it was probably someone's pet bear which had escaped,' Anna said. 'It is definitely not from around here.' The RSPCA confirmed it had also had a call about the animal a couple of days ago - described by a concerned resident as either a badger or a bear. But they were unable to find it. She thought the animal may have been a small bear - but it seems it may have been a South American coati . A South American coati, otherwise known as a ring-tailed coati, sitting in a tree in its natural habitat . A closer inspection of the video seems to reveal it is not a bear at all, but a South American coati, a small animal weighing between two and 7.2kg, and measuring just 33 to 44 inches. Half of their length is made up by their tail - but, in this case, the tail appears to have been severely shortened. This breed of coati was first discovered in Brazil, and lives in the jungles and rainforests of South America. If right, it is not the first time the coati has been spotted in Marlow: two years ago, a group of ramblers spotted an animal later confirmed as a coati in a wood near the market town. On that occasion, it was thought the coati had escaped from a sanctuary on an estate at Fawley Hill, Henley on Thames, owned by Lady Judy McAlpine, of the McAlpine construction empire.","Anna Shearer spotted the 'small dog' out the window of her Marlow home .

"Thanksgiving at the Margolies house is going to be awkward this year. Marjorie Margolies, a former congresswoman and mother-in-law to former first daughter Chelsea Clinton, crashed and burned in a bid to return to the House of Representatives on Tuesday, losing her Democratic primary in a landslide. Her epic Pennsylvania loss to state Rep. Brendan Boyle came despite campaign fundraising appearances by both Bill and Hillary Clinton, who couldn't push her above a 27 per cent showing in a four-way race. Margolies has courted controversy since 1993 when, in her first and only term in Congress, she cast the deciding vote in favor of then-President Bill Clinton's tax-raising 1993 budget. Marjorie Margolies conceded the election for the Democratic nomination in Pennsylvania's 13th Congressional District on Tuesday, losing in a landslide despite endorsements and fundraising help from Bill and Hillary Clinton . Happy couple: Chelsea Clinton and Marc Mezvinsky merged the two political families with troubled pasts, and Marc's mother's political flame-out will add new tensions . Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton turned an April fundraiser for Margolies into a mini campaign launch for herself, raising $200,000 for her son-in-law's mother but test-ballooning 2016 campaign issues at the same time . Republicans chanted 'Bye bye Marjorie' on the House floor, knowing her political life would take a hit since she had promised her constituents that she would never raise their taxes. Shortly after she lost her seat in the 1994 midterm election that swept Newt Gingrich and more than 50 other conservatives into power, she got a consolation prize in the form of a $600,000 grant for her charity, Women's Campaign International, from Bill Clinton's USAID. Part of Margolies' political baggage was linked to that charity. In 2001 after her husband, former Democratic Rep. Ed Mezvinsky, was indicted for investor fraud, Margolies lost everything – her property was liquidated to reimburse her husband's victims more than $10 million, and a judge refused to let her declare bankruptcy. She then doubled her own salary into six-figure territory, made a move to pay for a mansion for her to live in and billed it for a leased car. She also reportedly forced the charity's staffers to double as personal assistants to help her at a university where she taught. A pregnant Chelsea Clinton showed off her baby bump as she arrived in Los Angeles on Wednesday; her mother-in-law lost a congressional primary bid on Tuesday . Bill and Hillary Clinton both personally headlined fundraisers for Margolies, and they appeared together in a campaign commercial made near the end of the primary run. Hillary's appearance in April, however, appeared less focused on Margolies than on herself. The candidate didn't show up, and Mrs. Clinton road-tested campaign themes for the 2016 presidential election. In contrast, the power couple made nearly a dozen appearances last year in Virginia to help former Democratic National Committee chair Terry McAuliffe win a hotly contested governor's race.

"Experts are investigating whether a spate of whale and dolphin deaths along Scotland's west coast may be linked to the hunt for a Russian submarine. Whale and Dolphin Conservation has asked the MoD to detail what military movements took place off the Scottish and Irish coasts in December when a naval chase took place, with sinister echoes of Cold War-era submarine movies such as The Hunt for Red October. American planes aided the the hunt, which was sparked when a periscope was spotted in waters off Faslane where Royal Navy submarines normally surface as they head in or out of the base, home to Britain's nuclear deterrent. Scroll down for video . Fifteen Cuvier's beaked whales have been found stranded down the west coast of Scotland since December . The species holds the world record for the deepest and longest dive by a mammal - down to 2992 metres for a staggering two hours and 17 minutes . The locations of 10 of the reported 15 Cuvier's beached whale strandings are marked above, with two found beached on each of Mull, South Uist, Benbecula, Tiree and Kintyre since mid-December. HMS Ambush at Faslane, home to Britain's nuclear deterrent. A periscope spotted nearby sparked the hunt . Two US Navy aircraft were drafted in to carry out patrols in the North Atlantic amid fears a Russian submarine was lurking off the coast. But since the search experts have been baffled by an increasing spate of mystery deaths around the west coast of Scotland, including several by the world's deepest diving mammal. Scientists at the Hebridean Whale and Dolphin Trust (HWDT) say they have now received 15 reports since mid-December of stranded Cuvier's beaked whales, a species that is rarely seen due to its offshore distribution. The noise pollution caused by activities like the naval hunt can disrupt the behavioural patterns of whales and dolphins, driving them away from their regular haunts and potentially causing strandings and death. The strandings have occurred down the west coast between Scotland and Ireland including two on Mull, South Uist, Benbecula, Tiree and Kintyre. In addition other species of whale and dolphin have washed ashore along the west coast, including a killer whale on the Uists. Now conservationists want to know if sonar in particular - which can damage cetaceans and has been suspected in past strandings - was used in the submarine hunt. Dr Andrew Brownlow, head of the Scottish Marine Animal Stranding Scheme, said he was still waiting for the MoD's response. He said: 'WDC has asked the MoD for answers, which will be passed on to me. They want to know what military activity was taking place in the area at the time. Sean Connery in The Hunt For Red October. The recent naval hunt has echoes of the Cold War classic . 'It is possible that these strandings are linked to certain military activity. It is something we are looking at. 'But the animals were so badly decomposed we shall probably never know the answer.' Samples from some of the dead Cuvier's have been sent to Dr Brownlow for analysis. Dr Conor Ryan, sightings and strandings officer for HWDT, added: 'What we do know is that there has been a large and sudden cluster event. 'It may be biological or it may be man made. We are concerned because we have not known anything like this for the last six to eight years. 'We do not know why and we may never know, especially given the state of the animals.' Cuvier's whales can grow up to 23 feet and are widely distributed in tropical to cool temperate waters. Northern Scotland represents their northern-most limit. The species is the current world-record holder for the longest and deepest dive for a mammal - down to 2992 metres for a staggering two hours and 17 minutes. The pressure at this depth is 300kg per square centimetre. Other than the pair of teeth in adult males, beaked whales are toothless and are thought to use suction to catch their prey. Dr Conor Ryan of the Hebridean Whale and Dolphin Trust has voiced his concern about the strandings . In a statement on its website, WDC said: 'The mass stranding of rare, deep-diving whales along the coast of Ireland last December could be linked to a reported search by British navy warships for a suspected Russian submarine. 'Eight rarely sighted Cuvier's beaked whales have been found off the Irish coast in recent weeks together with a number of common dolphins, a minke whale, a sperm whale, pilot whales, a fin whale, and harbour porpoises. 'The total of 33 whales and dolphins washed up dead on Irish shores so far this year is a record. 'Last year a number of Cuvier's beaked whale deaths in Crete were thought to be due to military exercises in the area. 'Investigations following Britain's largest mass dolphin stranding in 2008 concluded that the only realistic cause was military exercises taking place in the area at the time. 'Noise pollution threatens whale and dolphin populations, interrupting their normal behaviour, driving them away from areas important to their survival, and at worst injuring or sometimes even causing their deaths. 'For whales and dolphins, 'listening' is as important as 'seeing' is for humans, yet there are still no international regulations regarding noise pollution in the world's seas.'","Naval chase sparked when periscope was spotted in waters off Faslane .

"An ancient Greek drinking game enjoyed more than 2,000 years ago at social drinking parties has been replicated by researchers. The game, known as kottabos, involved men gathered in a circle flinging dregs of wine at a target in the centre of the room from a special cup known as a kylix. And now the game has been recreated using a 3D-printer to try and work out the best way to play it - with results suggesting throwing the wine like a baseball rather than a Frisbee is more successful. Scroll down for video . Dr Heather Sharpe from West Chester University of Pennsylvania examined the ancient Greek drinking game of kottabos. The game involved men setting on couches around a room. They would drink wine from a shallow cup known as a kylix (shown). When they reached the dregs they flung the wine to the centre of the room . Dr Heather Sharpe, an assistant professor of art history at West Chester University of Pennsylvania, carried out the study into the game. It is thought to have been played in ancient Greek parties when men would relax on couches in the andron, a male-only room for social events with food and wine. There are two variations, both of which involve throwing wine from their shallow cup, known as a kylix, into the centre of the room. People gather on couches around the edge of a room while drinking while from a dish-like cup called a kylix. In the centre of the room is either a disc on a metal pole, or a bowl of water containing floating dishes. When party-goers get down to the dregs of their kylix, they should fling the liquid (not the cup) towards the centre of the room. The goal is to either knock the disc down or fill the floating dishes with wine so they sink, depending on the variation played. In the first variation, drinkers threw dregs of wine to try and knock down a disc balanced on a tall metal stand in the middle of the room. The other variation instead uses dishes floating in a larger bowl of water in the centre of the room. People had to throw their wine and attempt to get the dishes to sink. The game was understandably very messy, and with slaves thought to be required to clean up the resulting spilled wine. The game of skill is thought to have been especially popular at Greek and Etruscan symposia (drinking parties) in the 5th and 4th centuries BC. A kylix, seen here, has looped handles on either side, making it ideal for the throwing technique required for the ancient Greek drinking game of kottabos . Apparently, when flinging wine, the player would also be required to say the name of the object or person he desired. The game is likely of Sicilian origin but it  spread throughout Greece. Despite the apparent element of luck in the game, it did also require a surprising amount of skill. Players who were especially good at kottabos were often said to be favoured in other regards too, such as love, and large wagers were often also placed on a game. In her research, Dr Sharpe created a 3D-printed kylix to replicate the conditions of the game. She found that throwing the liquid out of the cup overhead, like a baseball, was easier than trying to flick it with the wrist like a Frisbee. But she said it likely descended into quite a messy affair, no matter how skilled the players were. Pictured is a statute of Dionysus, known as Bacchus by the Romans, the god of the grape harvest, winemaking and wine. Dionysus was important in Greek culture as alcohol, particularly wine, played an important role in many activities and social events . ‘In a typical symposium setting, in an andron, you would have had couches arranged on almost all four sides of the room, and if you missed the target, you were likely to splatter your fellow symposiast across the way,’ Dr Sharpe told LiveScience. ‘You'd imagine that, by the end of the symposium, you'd be drenched in wine, and your fellow symposiasts would be drenched in wine, too.’ However, she noted that she only used diluted grape juice in her version of the game, as it was a university attempt. For the full experiment, she said it would probably be best to have one or two kylixes of wine.

"Two sisters have been arrested in Cambodia for taking naked photos of each other inside the country's holy Angkor temple. Lindsey Adams, 22, and her 20-year-old sister Leslie, from Prescott, Arizona, were discovered taking 'nude pictures' inside the Preah Khan temple at the world heritage site on Friday. Local police said the women 'lowered their pants to their knees and took pictures of their buttocks.' The pair have been fined 1 million riel ($250) each, given six-month suspended jail sentences and are currently being deported by bus to Thailand, reports claim. They have been banned from returning to Cambodia for four years. Arrested: Lindsey Adams, 22, (pictured in an earlier holiday photo) and her sister Leslie, 20, were detained for taking naked pictures at Cambodia's sacred Angkor temple . Questions: Lindsay (left) and Leslie (right) from Prescott, Arizona, looked sullen as they spoke to police . Happier times: The sisters pulled funny faces and smiled in one of their more modest tourist snaps . A world heritage site, Angkor contains the remains of the different capitals of the Khmer Empire, dating from the 9th to the 15th centuries, and is Cambodia's most popular tourist destination. Chau Sun Kerya, a spokeswoman for the Apsara Authority, said the women's actions were offensive because Angkor is considered sacred ground. According to Cambodia Expats Online the pair were charged with indecent trafficking pornography and exposing sexual organs. Awaiting further action: Officials are debating what action to take and what charges to level against the girls . Accusations: A police officer said they were spotted pulling their pants to their ankles at the temple . Admitted their mistake: The girls apologized to officials and said they realized it was wrong, police said . Scene of the incident: They were taking nude photos inside the Preah Khan temple, one of Cambodia's oldest . 'Perhaps they did not know Angkor is a holy site. But their inappropriate activities affect the sanctity of the place,' she told AFP. 'The two tourists admitted that they really made a mistake by taking nude photos.' It is the second time in the last fortnight that tourists visiting the sprawling temple complex have been caught without their clothes. Three French tourists were deported last weekend after they pleaded guilty to taking nude pictures of each other inside another temple within the complex. The three deported French men received a suspended six-month prison sentence on two charges - public exposure and making pornography - and will be banned from re-entering Cambodia for four years. The trio were caught just days after a series of photos of Asian women posing nude at ancient Cambodian temples went viral online and outraged officials who vowed to step up efforts to prevent similar stunts.

"Today's high school seniors aren't partying and socializing as much as their parents' generation — they're too busy trying to get into college, and when they get there, some don't feel good about themselves, a new survey reports. The annual survey of college freshmen by UCLA's Higher Education Research Institute found that incoming students at four-year colleges and universities last fall devoted half as many hours to hanging out with friends during their final year of high school as students who entered college in 1987, when the institute first asked respondents about hobnobbing habits. The findings rang true to Isabella Galeazi, 18, who is juggling a job at McDonald's and a musical production internship along with a full-time course load at California State University, Fullerton. Balancing her professional and academic responsibilities with her desire for a thriving social life has proven a challenge that sometimes leaves her feeling snowed under, Galeazi said. Socializing: The annual survey by UCLA's Higher Education Research Institute found that socializing among college freshmen is the lowest its been in the past 30 years . 'My parents are always saying, 'When they were in school, when they were in school,' but I can show them my math homework and they have no clue how to do it,' she said. 'The work load is a lot heavier and the work is a lot harder. There is so much pressure to do well in high school or otherwise you won't get into college and if you don't do well in college you won't get a job.' The survey found that first-year-college students' sense of emotional well-being is at its lowest since the institute first asked the question in 1985. The results released Wednesday are consistent with other trends that indicate millennials face greater pressure to succeed academically and has less time to have fun, said Kevin Eagan, the institute's managing director and an assistant professor at UCLA . 'The declines we have seen in time spent partying and the frequency of alcohol use in high school and the increases we have seen in the number of college applications students are submitting and their reporting feeling overwhelmed are all signs students are internalizing this message that they need to take the last year of high school seriously,' Eagan said. Parents: Today's high school seniors aren't partying and socializing as much as their parents' generation — they're too busy trying to get into college (STOCK IMAGE) In the survey, nearly 39 percent said they spent five hours or less each week socializing, compared to the 18 percent who mingled with others that much in 1987. During the same 27-year period, the percentage of students who said they passed six or more hours each week 'partying' shrank from 35 percent in 1987 to 9 percent in 2014. When asked to rank their emotional health in comparison with their peers, half put themselves in the above-average category. Nearly 12 percent rated their emotional well-being as below average, a figure that stood at 3.5 percent in 1985. Jack Foley, 18, a freshman at the University of California, Davis and considers himself neither happier nor less happy than other people his age, advised parents not to read too much into the survey. Emotional Health: When asked to rank their emotional health in comparison with their peers, nearly 12 percent rated their emotional well-being as below average, a figure that stood at 3.5 percent in 1985 (STOCK IMAGE) Sure, today's older teenagers may be spending less time chilling out with friends than their folks did in the 1980s, but they connect with others through social media and the clubs and extra-curricular activities they have been primed to participate in since toddlerhood, Foley said. 'It's kind of a competition: 'Oh, you are stressed? I'm stressed!' Which isn't to say people aren't stressed, but I think there is an element of talking about how stressed you are because there is this twisted self-fulfillment level to measure up with your peers,' he said. 'In some ways, talking about how stressed you feel is a way to quantify how well you are doing and how hard you are working.' Dr. Gina Fleming, medical director of the University of California's student health insurance program, has been lobbying the 10-campus system's board to provide more money for counselors, psychologists and psychiatrists at student health centers. Over the last three years, there has been a 20 percent increase in students seeking help for anxiety or depression, Fleming said, with many also complaining of stomach aches, headaches and insomnia that are likely stress-induced. World Wide Web: Sure, today's older teenagers may be spending less time chilling out with friends than their folks did in the 1980s, but they connect with others through social media . 'There is a greater expectation that they need to succeed and do extremely well from the get-go at the same time they are dealing with the regular transitional issues of leaving home and adapting to the student environment,' she said. 'The pressure that starts in high school about 'What is your SAT score? What is your GPA? What are you going to study?' is so different from 1985.' The survey was based on the responses of 153,015 first-time, full-time students at 227 colleges and universities. The responses were statistically weighted to reflect the broader population of such students — approximately 1.6 million at 1,583 four-year schools.","The annual survey by UCLA's Higher Education Research Institute found that socializing among college freshmen is the lowest its been in 30 years .

"A midwife caught dosing herself with laughing gas in a hospital delivery room has been thrown out of the profession. Fiona Midgley inhaled so deeply on the nitrous oxide at East Surrey Hospital in Redhill, Surrey, that she was overheard by colleagues. They later heard her snoring as she had a quick kip on her rest break. Colleagues of Fiona Midgley at East Surrey Hospital heard her inhaling laughing gas in the delivery room . Staff tried to wake her twice by knocking on the door but found it was locked. When quizzed the midwife said she had taken the gas to help her sleep. She was suspended and made to carry out a 450 hour online learning course and write a 3,000 word 'reflective piece'. But she struck again on May 6, 2013, when back at work, this time taking a 4mg tablet of the antihistamine chlorphenamine, which also has a sedative effect, from the drugs cabinet. Midgley, who was not present but was represented at Wednesday's Conduct and Competence Committee hearing in Aldwych, London, admitted the charges and a string of other failings. These included not flagging up that a patient's blood pressure had increased to senior staff and giving a patient the powerful painkiller co-codamol without recording it, all on May 16. She also did not immediately transfer a woman who was 28 weeks pregnant with twins to the labour ward after being shown worrying signs her unborn babies were in distress. The midwife, who was later cautioned by police for stealing cosmetics, fragrance and children's clothing from Boots, accepted her actions amounted to misconduct and impaired her fitness to practise. Witness Helen Wickens, a supervisor midwife at the hospital, sent Midgley home after she used the Entonox equipment during a rest break. Nitrous oxide canisters. The gas is often inhaled for recreation but its medical use is as a painkiller . The mixture of 50 per cent nitrous oxide and 50 per cent oxygen is supposed to be reserved for patients with a need for acute, short-term pain relief. Entonox canisters contain 50 per cent nitrous oxide and 50 per cent oxygen for use as an analgesic . Ms Wickens told the hearing: 'When I told Fiona she had been heard using the Entonox equipment by her colleagues she admitted it immediately. 'I therefore felt she should not remain on that shift and should go home but I wanted her to see a health professional first. 'As it was a night shift, the only place she could do that was A and E but she declined that, and I also offered her a taxi home but she declined that as well.' Midgley admitted six separate counts of misconduct put to her. The panel found Midgley's fitness to practise currently impaired and ordered she be struck off the Nursing and Midwifery Council register. Announcing its decision, panel chair Penny Griffith said she put 'vulnerable' women in her care at risk of 'significant' harm and did not provide 'safe, responsive and compassionate' care. Ms Griffith said: 'The failures and omissions identified in this case were serious; some were far removed from the basic, fundamental standards of care expected of a midwife. 'We considered Midgley's misconduct to have placed vulnerable patients at unwarranted risk and she abused her position of trust . 'The risk of significant physical and emotional harm to Patient A, Patient B and their unborn babies was great. 'Doing harm to others or behaving in such a way that could foresee ably result in harm to others, particularly patients whether deliberately, recklessly, negligently or through incompetence is unacceptable. 'The seriousness of the potential harm that the registrant caused to these patients coupled with the caution for dishonesty is incompatible with on-going registration.'","Fiona Midgley was caught out at East Surrey Hospital in Redhill, Surrey .

"Joshua Graham Packer sat motionless in a California court on Friday as he was handed down three consecutive life sentences for the murder a wealthy pregnant couple in front of their children while attempting to rob the family's beach-front home. The crime occurred on May 20, 2009. Packer was 20 at the time. The prosecution said Packer had planned a robbery at the Faria Beach house, north of Los Angles, but ended up sexually assaulting mother-of-two Davina Husted, 42, who was six months pregnant, before stabbing her 30 times. He then stabbed her husband, Brock Husted, also 42, about 20 times. Scroll down for video . Motionless: Joshua Packer, 25, sits in a Ventura County courtroom Friday as he is sentenced for the killing of Brock and Davina Husted in their Faria Beach home in 2009. He was given three consecutive life terms . Murdered: Affluent couple Brock and Davina Husted and their unborn child were stabbed to death inside their Faria Beach home on May 20, 2009 . Seemingly safe: The Husteads lived in an exclusive gated community that had an active neighbourhood watch program; here, police block off the crime scene . The murders were witnessed by their then-nine-year-old son, who had ran to get cash from his mother's purse to give to the armed intruder. But when he returned, the man was stabbing his parents with a kitchen knife in the bedroom, according to search warrants in the triple murder case released in 2010. The boy told investigators his parents made the robber promise not to hurt him or his 11-year-old sister, who was sleeping, and the man agreed. The boy said his parents ran toward their bedroom and the intruder followed. He heard his mother scream, then hid behind the living room couch until the man left. The boy woke his sister and together, they checked on their parents' bodies. The children then locked the bedroom door and escaped through a window to a neighbor's home. Packer was armed and wearing a motorcycle mask during the attack. The doors to the house were not locked when he burst in. Evil: Joshua Packer, 24, was arrested in April 2010 after DNA linked him to the May 2009 stabbing deaths of Brock and Davina Husted. He is seen here in his arrest photo . Hunting for clues: Crime scene investigators found Packer's DNA at the scene. He was arrested in 2010 . The case has sparked national interest, in part because Ventura County, California – otherwise known as the Gold Coast – is one of the safest neighborhoods in the country. Packer was linked to the killings in 2010 by DNA testing of a sample taken following his arrest on suspicion of robbing a gas station in Santa Barbara County. The sample matched DNA found on the visor of the motorcycle helmet used by the killer, prosecutors said. The children were in court Friday as Packer's sentence was handed down. Now 25, he was initially facing the death penalty. 'I never believed there was evil in this world until the night of May 20, 2009 when my father and pregnant mother were brutally stabbed over and over again,' Isabelle Husted, now 16, said in her victim impact statement. Packer's defense had argued he was physically and sexually abused as a child. 'I don't care what pain he went through as a child ... I have no pity,' Husted said. 'Joshua Packer has caused so much pain ... and nothing can replace moments I could've had with my baby brother.' Gold Coast: The family lived in this beach house, which was later listed for $3.2million; Packer allegedly entered through the unlocked door . Packer did not speak at the sentencing because he thought it 'would be hollow and self-serving and detract from what the families have said today,' said Benjamin Maserang of the Ventura County public defender's office. 'He accepts responsibility for his actions,' Maserang told the Ventura County Star. 'He is relieved that his family and the victims' families will not have to go through the ordeal of a trial or any proceedings in this matter.' Packer avoided the death penalty by pleading guilty in December to first-degree murder of the Husteds and their unborn child, a boy who was to be named Grant. He also pleaded guilty to robbery and forcible oral copulation and was sentenced to 30 years and 4 months in prison in addition to the life terms. Booming business: Mr Hustead, centre left, ran a wrought-iron business called Custom Couture, which afforded he and his wife, centre right, a very comfortable lifestyle . His lawyers said Packer had offered to take a plea deal in exchange for a life sentence for years. But the prosecution wanted to pursue the death penalty. The deal finally was accepted after the California Supreme Court ordered a hearing on whether the top prosecutor, Mike Frawley, should be removed from the case because his children had spent time with Packer in a church youth group years ago. Mr Husted ran a custom-design wrought iron shop that catered to high-end clients, an extremely lucrative business. Mel Gibson and Oprah Winfrey were some of his clients. Mrs Husted was a former Miss California contestant.","Joshua Graham Packer was sentenced for the May 2009 murders on Friday .

"A five-year-old boy is convinced that he was a 30-year-old black woman in another life - and claimed to remember dying in a fire. Luke Ruehlman, from Cincinnati, Ohio, thought he was once called Pam and lived in Chicago - until he leaped from a burning building in 1993.

Luke Ruehlman, now five, claimed that he used to be Pamela Robinson, right, who died in . Beginnings: According to Luke's mother, Erika, at first he simply named things Pam, then started referring to when he 'used to be a girl' Though the recollections have since stopped, Luke's mother Erika told local station Fox8 how from the age of two Ruehlman would make references to his apparent alter ego. At first, she said, he would simply name things Pam and seemed fixated with the name. Later, she said, he would start making references to his apparent past life as a female. She said: 'He used to say: ""When I was a girl, I had black hair""’ or he would say, ""I used to have earrings like that when I was a girl.""' Fire: Pamela Robinson died when the Paxton Hotel in Chicago caught fire in 1993. According to his mother, Luke identified facts from the event with no prior knowledge of them . Uncanny: Luke's mother said internet searches based on information from Luke led her to reports of the 1993 blaze . She added that when confronted about who Pam could be, he said that he in fact used to be her, and said he remembered a bizarre process of reincarnation when he was 'pushed back down' to earth as a newborn. He said: 'Well, I used to be [Pam], but I died. I went up to heaven, and I saw God, and he pushed me back down and when I woke up, I was a baby and you named me Luke.' According to Erika, her son's claims were supported by facts he could not possibly have learned by himself. After revealing that in his 'former life' as Pam he lived in Chicago, Erika found an old news story which mentioned a Pamela Robinson, who died when the Paxton Hotel in the city caught light in 1993. Convinced: Erika Ruehlman, pictured, was initially sceptical but said he son has now convinced her of his past life .

In footage for the show The Ghost Inside My Child, Luke was shown a page full of pictures of black women in their 30s, only one of which was the dead Pamela Robinson. When asked to pick out Pamela, the footage claims, he chose the right picture. It was enough to convince Erika, who reached out to Robinson's family and said they told her more about her personality which seemed to match Luke. As examples, Erika said her son loves Stevie Wonder, as did Robinson, and also shares an enthusiasm for playing the keyboard, though her boy's was a children's version. When contacted by Fox8, however, they declined to comment.","Luke Ruehlman, from Cincinnati, Ohio, made claims about his past life .

"Two bombs in the Iraqi capital have killed more than 20 people just hours before the city's longtime curfew was set to come to an end. The deadliest attack happened in the New Baghdad section of the city. A suicide bomber detonated inside a restaurant in the predominantly Shi'ite neighbourhood of New Baghdad  killing at least 12 people and wounding 30 more. Shortly afterwards, another two bombs went off at the busy Sharqa market district, killing 10 more. A total of 22 people were killed and a further 55 injured in the attacks. Scroll down for video . Iraqi police clear pedestrians off a street after a suicide bomber detonated explosives inside a restaurant in Baghdad al-Jadida, east of the capital . No-one has stepped forward to take responsibility for the attacks, but suicide bombings are commonly used by armed groups in Iraq, including ISIS and the Levant. The interior ministry spokesman Brigadier General Saad Maan said he did not believe the blasts were linked to the decision to lift the curfew. The incident comes ahead of Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi's decision to lift Iraq's longtime curfew beginning at midnight Sunday. Police tape is hung near the site where a suicide bomber detonated explosives inside the restaurant hours before a years-old nightly curfew was due to be lifted . A form of curfew has been in place since the US-led invasion in 2003 against Saddam Hussein, with citizens restricted between midnight and 5am. Baghdad has remained relatively calm amid a rampage in northern and western Iraq by the al-Qaida-inspired Islamic State group. Recent bombings have frequently targeted Shiite-majority areas in the capital, including a bomb attack in central Baghdad on January 30 which killed 12 civilians when a blast went off in the Bab al-Sharqi district was followed by a car bomb. But the violence has been comparatively subdued from the darkest days of sectarian bloodletting in 2006 and 2007. Iraqi officials have repeated assured that the capital is secure, despite the occasional targeting of Baghdad's Shiite-majority neighborhoods by the Sunni militant group.","A suicide bomber detonated in a shop-lined street in Baghdad killing 12 people .

"Bans phones: Martin Stott, head of the Old Hall School in Wellington has initiated a 'digital detox' week . A headmaster is holding a 'digital detox' week to try to wean children and their parents off digital devices. Martin Stott, head of the Old Hall School in Wellington, Shropshire, believes many youngsters are growing up unable to read people's body language or facial expressions because their eyes never leave mobile devices. He thinks children should spend longer talking to each other, playing cards and people watching instead of being constantly absorbed by technology. Speaking to The Times, he said: 'When we take school trips or holidays, we don't allow mobile phones. We're hoping to challenge children to live without their mobile devices for a week.' Mr Stott is not completely opposed to technology. The Old Hall School in Wellington, which has pupils aged four to 11, uses digital devices during lessons and teaches basic programming and coding. But during the digital detox, the pupils will be encourages to spend more time talking to friends, reading books and attempting problem-solving puzzles. Mr Stott believes today's generation of youngsters are missing out on key skills because of their digital addiction. He added: 'You often see children in restaurants with iPads to entertain them while mum and dad chat over dinner. 'It erodes family time and they're missing out on messages from body language and fcail expressions from those around them. People watching is a great pastime for many but I think it's been lost to a degree.' Mr Stott says that families he has spoken to support the idea and have talked about renting cottages during holidays with no mobile phone reception or wi-fi signal. He is urging parents to participate in the digital detox week and turn their mobile phones off when possible. Missing skills: Mr Stott says many youngsters are growing up unable to read people's body language or facial expressions because their eyes never leave mobile device . After banning mobile phones on a school trip to France, he was asked how the pupils were supposed to pass the time on the journey. He said they should be playing cards, talking to each other and looking out of the window. The idea of a digital detox has become increasingly popular in the last few hours and several camps have sprung up around the world. One of the earliest was Camp Grounded in Anderson Valley, California - which allows zero access to phones, tablets, and other technology, with campers also banned from talking about work. Digital detox: The headmaster of the Old Hall School in Wellington (above) thinks children should spend longer talking to each other, playing cards and people watching . And as part of the program, everyone must use nicknames, to prevent people from using the camp as a 'networking opportunity'. In the UK, a digital device detox centre to rehabilitate phone and internet addicts has sprung up in the Welsh countryside. Aptly called ‘Unplugged Weekend’, it is nestled in the heart of the Brecon Beacons and runs festival-style weekends to help phone obsessives reconnect with real life. The camp-style set-up, which is imported from the US where it has taken off, is designed to help wean addicts off their devices and discover nature. Growing trend: Camps offering adults the chance to escape technology are becoming more popular.

"An actress used as the Queen's body double for a London 2012 Olympics James Bond short film was required to show the director her ankles to ensure they were as good as Her Majesty's. Julia McKenzie, 72, has revealed the unusual audition request was made after a director was concerned her legs wouldn't match the Queen's. Most famous for playing Miss Marple, Mrs McKenzie filmed over several days at Buckingham Palace after the Queen volunteered to participate in the film herself. Scroll down for video . Actress Julia McKenzie (pictured left) was used as a body double for the Queen (right) after directors decided her ankles were a close enough match to Her Majesty's 'very good legs' The film featured Daniel Craig as James Bond and the Queen meeting at Buckingham Palace . The short video showed Daniel Craig visiting the Queen at Buckingham Palace before boarding a helicopter - after which an actor dressed as Her Majesty parachuted into Olympic Stadium during the live ceremony. Minutes later, the Queen entered the stadium to rapturous applause. Mrs McKenzie told The Telegraph: 'We filmed over a few days at Buckingham Palace and I couldn't breathe a word to anyone. 'I'd worked with the director before and she thought it was something I'd be prepared to do, but she did say she had one proviso; she'd have to see my legs - because the Queen actually has very good legs and they'd be on show getting into the helicopter.' However, it appears the producers' preoccupation with the Queen's legs didn't end with just her body double. The stuntman who was dressed as the Queen for his parachute out of the helicopter during the ceremony also claimed he was selected for his legs. On the night, daredevil Gary Connery was sewn into a copy of the salmon dress the Queen was wearing and given a wig before launching himself into the stadium. After the film showed the Queen boarding the helicopter, a stuntman dressed as Her Majesty parachuted into the Olympic Stadium to rapturous applause . Asked why he was chosen for the jump, Mr Connery replied: 'Good question. I think they liked my legs.' He added: 'I’ve got Queen-style legs.' Gary, who completed the world’s first skydive without a parachute in May 2012, said he had only one regret from the night: ‘I really wanted to keep the dress, but I wasn’t allowed. It would have looked great on a night out.’ The result was the most talked-about sequence of Danny Boyle’s stunning Olympics opening ceremony.","Actress Julia McKenzie required to show her ankles during film audition .

"Jailed: Carl Hull was jailed for 20 years for raping a trainee nurse in 1998 in a 'terrifying, painful and humiliating' ordeal . A sick rapist who told his victim he 'did not care' when she pleaded with him to stop because she was a nun has been jailed for 20 years. Carl Hull, 43, attacked the terrified woman on December 29 1998, but escaped justice for 16 years after police were unable to trace DNA evidence to him. He was finally apprehended in 2012 after new technology allowed officers to retest the samples and link the crime to serial attacker Hull. Yesterday he was jailed for 20 years after admitting one count of rape at Birmingham Crown Court. The court heard that he launched the attack just four days after being released from prison for another indecent assault. Hull attacked the woman, who was 37 at the time, as she tried to get into her home in Edgbaston, Birmingham at around 8pm. He subjected her to a 'terrifying, painful and humiliating' ordeal and threatened to kill her when the trainee nurse claimed she was a nun in an attempt to end the attack. Jailing him Judge Melbourne Inman QC branded him a 'dangerous offender' who showed little insight into his crime. He said: 'You pushed her up against a wall, switched off the light and threatened to kill her twice. You tried to kiss her and when she resisted you threatened to kill her again. 'She said that she had no sexual experience and that she was a nun. You said you did not care and set about demonstrating that.' The court heard that sick Hull, from Sparkbrook, Birmingham, had a number of previous convictions and was caged for five years in 1995 after dragging a woman into a cubicle and assaulting her. Samantha Forsythe, defending, said the defendant was from an unhappy and trouble background and had made the 'brave' decision to plead guilty. Sentenced: Yesterday Hull was jailed for 20 years after admitting rape at Birmingham Crown Court, above . Speaking after the case a spokesperson for West Midlands Police said that Hull was serving another prison sentence when the cold case review was launched. He initially denied the attack, but admitted his crimes when confronted with the DNA evidence. Investigating officer, Detective Constable Emma Parker, said: 'Hull is an evil man: he raped a lone female in her own home resulting in devastating and lasting repercussions on her life for which he has shown no remorse. 'He is clearly a dangerous man and a threat to women*thankfully he's now off the streets for many years. 'This case shows that we never give up striving to win justice for victims. With the continuing advances in DNA we are able to routinely re-open cases, re-examine evidence and push for successful prosecutions. 'No-one who's committed an offence, even one many years ago, can rest easily because we could come knocking at any time. 'Despite her incredible fear she did everything she could, she tried talking to the man and calming him down but Hull said he didn't care and subjected her to an appalling assault before running off. 'I'm pleased we've finally been able to bring her attacker to justice and hope she can take some comfort for the fact he'll spend much of the rest of his life behind bars.' Hull was also ordered to sign the sex offenders register for life and serve an extended eight year licence on release.","Carl Hull, 43, attacked the woman in 1998 but escaped justice for 16 years .

"Special measures: Tameside Hospital in Manchester was one of 11 NHS Trusts ordered to undergo the ‘improvement’ process in July 2013 . Death rates at an NHS hospital have risen despite it being placed in special measures in an effort to bring them down. Tameside Hospital in Manchester was one of 11 NHS Trusts ordered to undergo the ‘improvement’ process in July 2013 by NHS England medical director Sir Bruce Keogh. But according to a shock report to be published today, mortality rates have actually increased, with about 35 more patients dying there in 2013 than was expected. Rates at a second hospital – Medway Maritime in Kent – which was also placed in special measures, have remained stubbornly high. Despite the news, the special measures programme has been deemed a success as death rates fell significantly at eight out of 11 hospitals – saving about 450 lives. The figures are disclosed in a report today by healthcare analysts Dr Foster – and the results matter politically because the special measures programme was ordered personally by Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt. Last night, grieving relative Frank Lynch said he watched his 89-year-old mother Phyllis Hutchings turn into a ‘bag of bones’ before her death at Medway last August. Shock report: Mortality rates have actually increased at Tameside Hospital, with about 35 more patients dying there in 2013 than was expected . He believes his mother, who suffered from dementia, died of malnutrition because nurses failed to feed her. A Tameside Hospital spokesman suggested that ‘data quality issues’ might explain in part why death rates had gone up. A spokesman for Medway Maritime said a ‘targeted programme of work’ was being put into place.","Tameside Hospital placed in special measures to bring death rate down .

"The woman accused of abandoning her Down syndrome son has hit back at her husband's claims and said she had to make a 'ruthless decision' in the best interests of the child. Ruzan Badalyn gave birth to baby Leo on January 21 in an Armenian hospital but within hours, she had allegedly filed for divorce from her husband Sam Forrest after he refused to give up on their child. She became a hate-figure around the world after Sam claimed his wife of eighteen months handed him an ultimatum: her, or his newborn son. But an angry Ruzan has now disputed his version of events and said the couple had agreed that baby Leo would have a better quality of life if he was raised in his father's native New Zealand. Scroll down for video . Newborn: Little Leo, who was born with Down syndrome, is at the centre of a row between his parents Ruzan and Sam . Pregnant: Ruzan, who is seen here cradling her bump, was accused of refusing to look at or even touch her first-born son . Heartbroken: Dad Sam is now desperately trying to crowd fund to flee Armenia so he can raise Leo back in his native New Zealand . Statement: Ruzan posted her version of events on Facebook, where she wrote the day her son was born was 'the happiest day for me' Ruzan, who confirmed that she has filed for divorce, released a statement of her version of events on Facebook. It read: '21 January was the happiest day for me, as I finally gave birth to my long-awaited son. Our son was born at 6.30 in the morning and I remember alarmed faces around and doctors worried looks. I woke hours after anaesthesia. 'My first question was about the whereabouts of my child. I remember the sad faces of my relatives and the doctors and the diagnosis that sounded like a verdict: ''Your child was born with a Down Syndrome.'' One can never imagine my feelings at that moment . 'Hardly had I recovered from the first shock, when the doctor approached me and told me to voice my decision whether I was going to keep Leo or not. I had to make the most ruthless decision in my life within several hours. 'The first thing that came to my mind after the diagnosis was that I don't want my child to live in a country where certain stereotypes dominate the lives of people with DS and no opportunities at all. I want him to be involved and well-received in society, an integration that will require years and years for our society to adjust to. 'I saw the evasive looks of the doctors, my relatives' tear-stained faces, received calls of condolences and realised that only a move to a country with such standards as New Zealand would entitle my son to a decent life. Happy day: Ruzan Badalyn (left) pictured at her wedding alongside her sister Arevik . Happier times: The couple have only been married 18 months but are now locked in a bitter battle over their son's future . Sam Forrest (right), who runs an online business in Armenia's capital Yerevan, pictured with Ruzan's brother Stepan . 'This fact was not disputed by my spouse either, who occasionally claims in his articles that the baby can't afford the life he deserves in Armenia. Thus, I spent the hours after Leo's birth trying to collect my will and decide on the best destiny for the kid. 'Everyone in our family realised that the baby's interests should be placed first and only his move to another country could remedy the situation, something that Sam himself also accepted. 'I understood that in Armenia, where is no extensive social infrastructure to help children with developmental disabilities, no governmental support, with the continuous hard economic situation in the country, with the possibility of renewed war with our hostile neighbour--with whom the fragile cease-fire seems to be deteriorating over time--always looming in the background, with my salary of 180$ being partly supported by my sister and living in my mother’s place and having no other income, as my husband did not work, I would not be able to raise my child with special needs. 'In Armenia every child is loved and respected and family is a high value, but in this country children with special needs do require special attention, huge financial resources and dedication. 'In the hardest moment of my life when my husband should be next to me and support and help to take the right decision, I could not find any support from his side. 'After that incident, he left the hospital notifying me hours later that he was taking the kid with him, that he is going to leave the country for New Zealand and I do not have anything to do with the situation. 'Without giving me any option and trying to find with me any solution in this hardest situation, he started to circulate the story on every possible platform without even trying to give me a voice accusing that I put him an ultimatum marriage or the baby, which is absolutely not true. Wedding: Sam and Ruzan are pictured here on their wedding day - but the couple are now arguing over what they had agreed was best for their son . 'I tried several times to communicate but he never tried to listen me and to find common solutions. The only response was the accusation from his part. Sam has never suggested joining him and bringing up the child together in his country. 'Neither did he tell me anything on the day we filed for divorce. The only thing he kept saying was that he didn't want us to separate, whereas my question what we should do always remained unanswered. 'As a mother who has faced this severe situation, being in the hospital under stress and depression, experiencing enormous pressure from every side, not finding any support from my husband’s part on any possibilities of giving a child decent life in Armenia, I faced two options: to take care of the child on my own in Armenia, or to abandon my maternal instincts and extend the baby an opportunity to enjoy a decent life with his father in New Zealand. I went for the second option.' In a further twist today, Sam has now said he forgives his wife and that he understands the pressure that exists in Ruzan's home country. Speaking to the Daily Mirror, he said: 'I don't hold anything against Ruzan. I wanted this personal responsibility and I've assumed it for Leo and she's also made her own decisions. 'I am fully sympathetic about the societal pressures and issues with the culture. There are many factors that come into play.' He also said that he still believes the couple have a future together and added: 'I adore her and I want to carry through those memories for Leo. I want him to know how good his mum was. I'll hold out the possibility in the future that there will be the possibility of a connection. Inspirational: Sam claimed his wife refused to look at or even touch her son because Armenian culture believes a child with a condition like DOwn syndrome brings shame on the entire family . 'The door will always be open. For that to happen she will need to fully accept Leo and take on her responsibilities as a mother.' Sam, who runs an online business in Armenia's capital Yerevan, claimed that Ruzan and her family were ashamed of Leo's condition and had decided to abandon the child without consulting him first. But Ruzan hit back at those claims and said: 'I tried several times to communicate but he never tried to listen me and to find common solutions. The only response was the accusation from his part. Flee: Sam has now raised more than $440,000 via his crowdfunding page as he seeks to bring Leo back to his native New Zealand . 'Sam has never suggested joining him and bringing up the child together in his country. Neither did he tell me anything on the day we filed for divorce.' Sam claimed his wife refused to look at or even touch her son because Armenian culture believes a child with a condition like Leo's brings shame on the entire family. When Leo was born, Samuel said he wasn't immediately allowed to see his son or wife. He said: 'This paediatrician walks out of the room with a little bundle... She had his face covered up and hospital authorities wouldn't let me see him or my wife. 'When the doctor came out, he said 'there's a real problem with your son'.' Samuel said he was shocked when doctors initially told him of Leo's Down syndrome, but it never crossed his mind to abandon him. He added: 'They took me in to see him and I looked at this guy and I said, he's beautiful, he's perfect and I'm absolutely keeping him.' The first-time father set up a webpage to crowd fund as he tries to flee the eastern European country so he can raise Leo back in his native New Zealand. The fundraising page, titled Bring Leo Home, has already raised more than $440,000, leaving Sam stunned by the outpouring of support.","Ruzan Badalyan gave birth to Leo on January 21 in an Armenian hospital .

"Andrew Lloyd Webber's driver was arrested after being caught stealing the Oscar-winning composer's housekeeping cash . Andrew Lloyd Webber's driver was arrested after being caught stealing the Oscar-winning composer's housekeeping cash. Police were called to the theatre impresario's £15million townhouse in Belgravia, central London, on Thursday and led away his 45-year-old driver in handcuffs. The chauffeur, who was wearing a bright purple tie and navy-blue jacket as he was taken to the police car, has now been sacked, according to Lord Lloyd-Webber's company, Really Useful Group. He was arrested on suspicion of 'theft employee' and taken to a nearby police station where he admitted the offence and accepted a caution. A source told The Sun that hundreds of pounds had gone missing from the composer's mansion in recent weeks. Lord Lloyd-Webber, the theatre impresario behind musicals including Cats and Evita, is worth an estimated £640million and was ranked 162 in The Sunday Times' Rich List last year. His annual profits were boosted by the success of his Charlie And The Chocolate Factory musical, as pre-tax profits of Really Useful Investments were raised to £6.2million  to June 2014. The composer's revival of Cats, the musical, starring Nicole Scherzinger is set to extend its West End run with 100,000 extra tickets after 'extraordinary' demand from a new generation of fans. He recently said of the former Pussycat Doll, 'I think she is the real deal, the absolute real deal. 'She is what you might call an American theatre babe. I do believe she is the most exciting musical theatre artist I have found – well, that I have worked with – in very, very many years. I really do.' Lord Lloyd-Webber was recently named among a string of celebrities including David Beckham and Bob Geldof who are facing having to pay the taxman a total of £1billion in a dispute over a suspected tax avoidance scheme. Police were called to the theatre impresario's £15 million townhouse in Belgravia, central London, on Thursday and led away his 45-year-old driver in handcuffs . His annual profits were boosted by the success of his Charlie And The Chocolate Factory musical . The composer told the Sunday Times he was advised that he was being 'almost philanthropic by investing in the British film industry, and that this was a scheme to promote British films', adding: 'At no time did I consider it solely a tax scheme.' He lives in his Belgravia townhouse with his third wife, Madeleine Gurdon, a former equestrian sportswoman. A Met Police spokesman said: 'Police were called to reports of a theft at an address in SW1 at 1.20pm on Thursday 5 February. 'A 45-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of theft employee and was taken into police custody. He was cautioned and there will not be a court appearance.' Lord Lloyd-Webber's spokesman refused to comment.

'We had been out in the fields one day rounding up stray cows that had wandered off from the herd and at the end of it he was very tired. 'In the past, I would get on the horse and he would trot alongside us as we went home. 'But on this particular day when I climbed onto the horse he jumped up behind me and rested his paws on my shoulder and barked, as if to say 'Ok, let's go'.

"An overjoyed mother who had given up after suffering multiple miscarriages in six years has finally given birth. Stephanie Maundrell-Merritt had decided to stop trying to have more children after she tragically lost eight babies in pregnancy, all between the ages of six and 12 weeks. The heartbroken 38-year-old and her husband Adam had decided to move on with their lives when Mrs Maundrell-Merritt fell pregnant unexpectedly. Stephanie Maundrell-Merritt is overjoyed after giving birth to daughter Ophelia Hope after suffering multiple miscarriages . Nine months later and, in the early hours on New Year's Eve, the long-awaited baby Ophelia Hope was born to the ecstatic couple. 'All we had was hope - that's why her middle name is Hope,' explained Mrs Maundrell-Merritt who said she spent her whole pregnancy in fear of losing her daughter. 'I look at her and see she's the reason the others didn't go right because without the miscarriages she wouldn't be here. 'It's been a real shock - I spent nine months in denial hoping against hope. It only dawned on me that I was having my baby when I was actually in labour.' Stephanie, of Ipswich, Suffolk, had suffered her first miscarriage with her ex-husband, the father of her 18-year-old son Josh Caley. Happy families: Mrs Maundrell- Merritt with baby Ophelia Hope, husband Adam (left) and Stephanie's son Josh Caley (right) who were all delighted to welcome the latest addition to the family . But she went onto lose a staggering seven more babies after marrying Mr Merritt until the couple finally agreed to stop trying to start their own little family. 'Because of the hormones I got to a point where I said 'I can't do this any more,' added Stephanie. 'We just said 'we have tried everything'. 'We were at peace. We weren't going to have our own child and you're trying to move on with your life.' The mother-of-two said medical experts could never exactly pinpoint why she was having so many miscarriages. 'That's what I found the hardest. It got to the point where we just stopped telling our families what was happening.' 'No one could get excited for us then as you can't get excited yourself because you are waiting for the inevitable. 'I spent the whole of my pregnancy in fear every time.' 'Falling pregnant with Ophelia Hope was a complete accident.' Mr Merritt, 29, said: 'We had hard times, it's obviously not been plain sailing,' said Adam, a senior multinational caseholder at QBE Insurance. 'Physically it's not happening to you as a man so you don't have that connection. It was different for me as you're seeing your partner go through it.' Mrs Maundrell-Merritt had decided to stop trying to have more children after she tragically lost eight babies in pregnancy, all between the ages of six and 12 weeks . Mrs Maundrell-Merritt fell unexpectedly pregnant again last year and on December 31, at 5.16am, she gave birth to happy, healthy baby girl Orphelia Hope weighing 6lbs 5ozs . When Mrs Maundrell-Merritt fell pregnant last year, the couple knew something was different. Once they were past the first trimester, the period of the pregnancy with the highest risk of miscarriages, they began to hope. 'With Ophelia our normal milestones got smashed,' said Mr Merritt. 'We had never got to 12 weeks before. After that I started to think that this one could really work.' Mrs Maundrell-Merritt decided to have scans every two weeks for her peace of mind, and on December 31, at 5.16am, she gave birth to a happy, healthy baby girl weighing 6lbs 5ozs. 'It doesn't take away what we went through, but there's a reason why she's here and a reason why it all happened,' said Mrs Maundrell-Merritt, who works in sales and marketing at insurance giant Willis. 'It's still hard to believe that I've become a mum again. 'You don't complain - you just have to get on with it. She keeps me up at night but I don't care at all. She could be sick on me, I don't care, because she's here. 'Even as dark as it can get there will always be hope and light and the end of the tunnel. 'Irrespective of where you are there are people who understand and can support you. It doesn't always end in giving up.' There were an estimated 250,000 miscarriages in the UK in 2010 alone. The Ipswich and Suffolk branch of the Miscarriage Association, which supports people affected by the loss of a baby, praised Stephanie for her perseverance. Telephone counsellor Sarah Tomley said: 'Stephanie knows we are all extremely thrilled for her. 'It's amazing she has managed to go through this. It takes a great deal of bravery to do what she's done and she's an extraordinary woman.'","Stephanie Maundrell-Merritt lost eight babies in pregnancy in six years .

"A mysterious 'milky' rain has been falling over the Pacific Northwest that is baffling meteorologists. Residents of Washington, Oregon and Idaho have been filling up glasses of the unusual substance trying to determine what it could be. One strong possibility is that the weather system has been infected by eruptions from Japan's Sakurajima volcano. Scroll down for video . Milky: Residents of Washington, Oregon and Idaho have been filling up glasses of the unusual substance . The weather system could have been infected by eruptions from Japan's Sakurajima volcano, experts say . The volcano has been particularly active over the past month. Last week it sent an ash plume of three miles billowing into the sky. It is the most active Sakurajima has been all year, with up to three or four explosions a day, according to Volcano Discovery. Following a particularly violent eruption on Thursday, some speculated that Russia's Shiveluch volcano could have sent ash into the sky that was blown across the Pacific Ocean, as well. In the past two weeks, eight eruptions have been recorded. The Walla Walla County office in Washington corroborated those suggestions in a Facebook post. Dirty rain: The rain has left window like this one murky and seemingly covered with filth . The National Weather Service in Spokane, Washington, is now investigating different volcano sources . The volcano has been particularly active this month. Last week it sent a 5km ash plume billowing into the sky . 'We have received reports of ""white stuff"" on vehicles,' officials wrote. 'The ash is more than likely from Volcano Shiveluch in Kamchatka Krai, Russia, which spewed an ash plume to about the 22,000-foot level in late January. 'It has been deposited in a wide spread area, including Washington and Oregon.' But the National Weather Service of Spokane, Washington, is still investigating. 'The truth is that we really don't know where it came from!' the NWS Spokane said on Facebook. 'We are continuing to investigate and have reached out to other offices for assistance in recreating atmospheric flows from the past several days. We've also reached out to other agencies that may have collected samples appropriate for testing.'","Residents in Washington, Idaho and Oregon are seeing 'milky' rain .

"A British grandmother on Death Row in Bali for cocaine smuggling has been told she is being listed for execution, in a move that could see her face a firing squad as early as next month. Prison warders handed 58-year-old Lindsay Sandiford a letter from Indonesian prosecutors on Tuesday which informed her of her fate. Her execution by firing squad now seems certain to go ahead unless – as the letter also informed her – she urgently files papers for a final legal appeal against her sentence. No mercy: Lindsay Sandiford in Kerobokan prison on Friday having her letter, explaining she could face a firing squad as soon as next month, translated . Sandiford has no lawyer or funds to pay the £50,000 cost of contesting her death sentence, and has been refused financial help by the British Government. Her situation is further complicated by the suspension of Britain’s top diplomat in Bali, vice-consul Alys Harahap, 31, over her jail romance with drug lord Julian Ponder, who Sandiford claims coerced her into becoming a drugs mule. Last night Sandiford told relatives: ‘Time is running out for me. The whole thing is surreal. I just can’t believe it is happening.’ The letter to Sandiford was in Indonesian and was translated for her by prison staff. It read: ‘Unless you file an application for a PK [a retrial based upon new evidence] as soon as possible, you will be listed for execution.’ Last night, former Director of Public Prosecutions Lord Ken Macdonald called on the British Government to intervene immediately and fund a lawyer for Sandiford. He said: ‘It is completely hypocritical for the UK to argue for the abolition of the death penalty worldwide and at the same to refuse to give proper assistance to a British citizen facing a firing squad. Death Row: The grandmother, 58, takes in the grim news . ‘If the British Government opposes the death penalty as it says it does, it should put its money where its mouth is and help this woman.’ Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond is standing firm on his refusal to fund her legal fight, despite a recommendation to do so by five Supreme Court judges in London who voiced grave concerns over the way her case had been handled. Mr Hammond was in Jakarta on Wednesday for trade talks with his Indonesian counterpart Retno Marsudi. She said afterwards that Mr Hammond had voiced concern about Sandiford but did not lobby for her. Ms Marsudi told him the execution was in line with international law. Six convicts, including Dutch and Brazilian citizens and three other foreigners, were executed in January and a second group of 11, including two Australians held in Kerobokan prison with Sandiford, will be executed before the end of the month. The next batch of executions are expected to take place in March. A PK hearing is the only legal avenue for Sandiford to avoid the death penalty after president Joko Widodo declared he would ignore all clemency pleas from convicted traffickers and go ahead with executions. Shocked relatives of the Yorkshire grandmother are now frantically trying to find an Indonesian lawyer to represent Sandiford. Speaking from her prison cell, Sandiford told a relative yesterday: ‘I need a really good Indonesian lawyer now or else I am in desperate trouble.’ Doomed: An Indonesian official with a letter rejecting a separate Death . She said recent executions had left the atmosphere in the prison ‘very sombre’. But she added: ‘The guards are being incredibly nice to me. The guards and the officers are very caring. I have the full support of everyone including the governor. ‘Everyone is bending over backwards to help me. They are all talking about it [her plight]. When they executed the six prisoners last month some of the guards were actually crying.’ Sandiford admitted smuggling £1.6million worth of cocaine into Bali from Thailand in 2012 but claims she was pressured into trafficking the drugs by threats made to the lives of her sons by syndicate members, including Ponder. Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond has refused to fund Sandiford's legal battle, despite five Supreme Court judges recommending to do so . After her arrest she took part in a police sting operation that led to the arrest of Ponder, 45, from Brighton, and three others. Sandiford was sentenced to death in spite of a prosecution recommendation that she serve 15 years, while Ponder was jailed for six years for cocaine possession. The other three received terms of between one and six years. Ponder is widely believed to have paid huge bribes to secure reduced charges and lower sentences for all suspects except Sandiford who he admits he detests for taking part in the police sting. The Supreme Court asked the Foreign Secretary to urgently review Sandiford’s case and consider funding a lawyer because Indonesian courts had ignored ‘substantial mitigating factors’ and because of the ‘remarkable disparity’ of her sentence compared to that of Ponder and the other defendants. Mr Hammond rejected the judges’ recommendation. In Jakarta he attended a ceremony marking a £100 million deal to supply Rolls-Royce engines to an Indonesian airline and discussed co-operation between the two countries’ navies. Sandiford’s sister Hilary Parsons was yesterday in Australia seeking help for her through anti-death penalty charities and lawyers. ‘It is very, very difficult for us as a family,’ she said. ‘It’s overwhelming. It’s all day, every day, trying to get help for her and just hoping that the worse doesn’t happen. ‘I’m talking to people in Australia who have offered help and hopefully we can find a competent Indonesian lawyer to help Lindsay.’ Ironically, Ms Parsons suggested, Alys Harahap could be asked to give evidence to a PK hearing if lawyers believe she has new evidence from her intimate conversations with Ponder. He claims they spoke by phone up to 50 times a day at the height of their romance. ‘My sister’s life is hanging in the balance,’ Ms Parsons said. ‘If Alys Harahap has any new information about the case from her conversations with Julian Ponder, she should let us know immediately.’ Sandiford has been languishing on death row since being convicted of drugs smuggling in 2012 . Listed for execution: Last night Sandiford told her relatives: ‘Time is running out for me' A spokesman for the Foreign Office confirmed Ms Harahap was still suspended but would not comment on whether the investigation had discovered any information that might be of use to Sandiford’s case. Asked about Mr Hammond’s visit to Jakarta, the spokesperson said: ‘In each of his ministerial meetings in Jakarta, he raised the issue of the use of the death penalty, which the UK strongly opposes in all circumstances without exception. ‘We will continue to raise the subject with the Indonesians. ‘We are closely following Lindsay Sandiford’s case. She had regular contact with British consular officials in Bali until September 2014, at which point she declined to accept any further support. ‘We stand ready to offer her consular assistance and we would, of course, visit her in prison if she changed her mind.’","British grandmother on Death Row in Bali could face next month .

"The body of Julie Semper (pictured) was found in her Victorian flat in Nottingham by a neighbour . A man has been arrested on suspicion of murder after a college lecturer and children’s author was found dead at her home. The body of Julie Semper, a business studies tutor at a sixth form college, was found by a neighbour in her Victorian flat in an upmarket suburb. The neighbour, Nicky Noyes, yesterday said Miss Semper, 47, had recently separated from her boyfriend. She said: 'I don’t want to go in to details, but I saw Julie lying on the floor. She wasn’t moving so I called the police. I don’t want to say if there were any signs of how she died. 'Julie lived on her own. She was a lovely, lovely person. We had only known each other for a few months but we had become good friends. 'She was very happy in her job at the college and often spoke about how well her students were doing. 'She had a grown-up daughter but I had never met her.' Miss Noyes confirmed her neighbour had been in a relationship but said they ‘broke up a while ago’. Police were today carrying out forensic examinations at the cordoned-off £200,000 flat in Mapperley Park, Nottingham, where Ms Semper is thought to have lived alone. Her neighbours included the £5m Nottingham Forest footballer Britt Assombalonga. Ms Semper, who described herself as having an interest in reading about 'true life crime and particularly serial killers' on a writers’ website, had published a Harry Potter-style book on Amazon called 'Emily Moon and the Fire Demon', which featured a schoolgirl whose parents were possessed by demons. The lecturer taught business at Bilborough College in Nottingham, since September. The sixth form college regularly sends students to Oxford and Cambridge Universities. Nottinghamshire Police said a 24-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder at another location on Thursday. He remained in custody yesterday. Ms Semper was found in her Victorian flat (pictured) in the upmarket area of Mapperley Park, Nottingham . Chris Bradford, principle of 1,800 Bilborough College - which is rated ‘good’ by Ofsted - said Miss Semper was a ‘valued member of our cover team and we were extremely saddened to hear what had happened.’ Miss Semper, who does not appear to have married, lived in her flat for about 18 months. The large Victorian building is currently undergoing a luxury make-over. She had previously lived at another flat on the same road. The children's author wrote this book, titled 'Emily Moon and the Fire Demon', which was published on Amazon . A neighbour there, Linda Gibson, a social sciences lecturer at Nottingham Trent University, said: ‘This is so very sad, very tragic. Julie was very chatty and bubbly. ‘We got on because we were both in the teaching profession. She moved from here about 18 months ago and didn’t really keep in touch.’ Another neighbour said: ‘She was a good neighbour. The only time you heard any noise is when she played her piano.’ In her profile on writers’ website Authonomy, Ms Semper wrote: ‘I am a project manager and business tutor. ‘In my spare time I write gothic fantasy literature, TV and film scripts as well as plays. I enjoy reading true life crime particularly about serial killers as well as dark and white magic books. ‘I am a film addict and will watch anything from sci-fi to rom-com. I first started writing during a screenwriters course where I wrote a script called Lilith about a female vampire and received very positive feedback from writers and directors that I kept on writing. ‘In my spare time I practice clairvoyancy, healing, and house clearing (exorcisms).’ Miss Semper was also thought to have run her own holistic therapy business. A second online profile described her as a ‘qualified Reiki master’ who also performed past life regression. A Nottinghamshire Police spokesman said a 24-year-old man had been arrested and was being questioned in connection with the death.","Body of Julie Semper, 47, found in her Victorian flat where she lived alone .

"Their hairy pink tails not yet curled, the swine of piglets sniffed the hay beneath their hooves as they trotted along together. Far from the confines of a sty, the animals were making their way through the meat aisle of a French supermarket as part of a farmer's protest against plunging pork prices. Blissfully unaware of their role in the political stunt, they perused shelves of lardons and chorizo at the Geant supermarket in St Gregoire near Rennes. A swine of piglets was released in a French supermarket as part of a farmers' protest against the dropping price of pork across Europe . Their little ears pricked, the pigs pressed their noses against the freezer and fridge doors as stunned shoppers looked on . They had been released by the farmers' group FDSEA who are campaigning against the lowering price of pork and lack of brands which state where the meat has originated in its packaging. 'The price we're paid for pork is too low, it doesn't allow us to cover our own food and housing costs,' said Damien Legand, a farmer from Parigne, Ille-et-Vilaine. Adding he and others were 'working at a loss,' he said: '90 per cent of the products in the aisle come from outside France,' he said. 'It's bad for us but also for French buyers.' Elsewhere, members of Jeunes Agriculteurs carried out similar protests in supermarkets in Brest and Quimper. 'We have the right to demand that the origin of the meat be identified, we have the right to buy meat from France, Italy or Spain but the EU figures aren't high enough,' said Yves-Hervé Mingan, a member of the organisation. The price of a kilo of pork reached a new low at 1.08 euros on Thursday, with farmers demanding it be raised at least 30 cents immediately. Paying their respects: The little animals were seen sniffing packets of chorizo and lardons as they shuffled through hay . Farmers were complaining not enough of the meat on sale in the supermarket clearly stated where it had come from on its outer packaging .","The animals were released by protesting farmers in a Rennes supermarket .

"Poisoned spy Alexander Litvinenko was a top analyst for MI6, causing the KGB to have him murdered for 'treason'. That's according to one of the Russian dissident's closest confidantes Yuri Felshtinsky, a historian who co-authored the book Blowing Up Russia with the former secret agent. He has claimed his former collaborator should have been protected by British intelligence from the KGB assassins who allegedly poisoned him with radioactive plutonium-210 at a central London hotel in November 2006. Scroll down for video . Yuri Felshtinsky (left) claims Alexander Litvinenko (right) was murdered by the KGB for working with MI6 . In an interview with police while he lay on his deathbed, Mr Litvinenko said that Andrei Lugovoi and Dmitri Kovtun 'wanted to kill me'. Mr Felshtinsky has submitted testimony to the ongoing public inquiry into Mr Litvinenko's fatal poisoning. The book the pair wrote accused the FSB, the contemporary name for the KGB, of blowing up Moscow apartment blocks to justify a war against Chechnya. A final photograph of Mr Litvinenko, taken as the former KGB spy was dying in hospital shortly before he lost consciousness for the last time, was shown to the inquiry this week. The 43-year-old agreed to have pictures taken during his final days so that the world could see how 'he was poisoned by the Kremlin'. His friend Alex Goldfarb told the hearing that the image, which shows him gaunt and obviously gravely ill, was the last ever taken before he died from radiation poisoning at University College Hospital. The last photo taken of Mr Litvinenko before he died was shown to the inquiry into his death this week . Dimitry Kovtun (left) and Andrei Lugovo (right) have been accused of murdering the former KGB spy . Marina Litvinenko  leaves the Royal Courts of Justice on Tuesday following a session of the inquiry into her husband's death . The inquiry was also told Mr Litvinenko had a 'feeling' that two Russian men were planning to murder him during the meeting in which he drank tea laced with plutonium. Mr Felshtinsky co-wrote a book with Mr Litvinenko, accusing the FSB of blowing up Moscow apartment blocks to justify a war against Chechnya . He met the two men, Lugovoi and Kovtun, at the Millennium Hotel in central London on November 1, 2006, and drank a few sips of tea which later turned out to be poisoned, the hearing was told. The Russian dissident, who fled to the UK in 2000 and claimed asylum before becoming a British citizen, rapidly fell ill and began foaming at the mouth, while vomiting up bloody portions of his stomach lining. It is understood he met a man known as 'Martin', his MI6 handler, at Waterstones Piccadilly branch on October 31 - the day before the suspected poisoning. Giving evidence at the inquiry, Mr Litvinenko's widow Marina wept as she told the court her husband's last words were, 'I love you so much.' Mrs Litvinenko kept a daily bedside vigil as her husband deteriorated from a 'healthy and good looking man' to a dying patient whose vital organs were failing fast. During one visit she stroked his head only for clumps of hair to fall out in her hand and onto the pillow. The inquiry has previously been told that the spy was one of Vladimir Putin's fiercest critics, and had allegedly been told that the Russian government was planning to murder him. The hearing continues.","Yuri Felshtinsky claims Alexander Litvinenko should have been protected .

"A West Virginia lawmaker has apologized over recent comments he made about childbirth resulting from rape. Republican state legislator Brian Kurcaba said on Thursday that women who are raped should not be able to abort their pregnancies, and that the child that comes as a result is 'beautiful.' This as he argued in favor of a bill that would ban abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy. Republican state legislator Brian Kurcaba said on Thursday that women who are raped should not be able to abort their pregnancies, and that the child that comes as a result is 'beautiful' 'For somebody to take advantage of somebody else in such a horrible and terrifying and brutal way is absolutely disgusting,' said Kurcaba in his speech according to WOWK. 'But what is beautiful is the child that could come as a production of this.' He quickly issued an apology however following public outrage over this belief. 'I apologize to anyone who took my comments about the sanctity of human life to mean anything other than that all children are precious regardless of circumstances,' he said in the statement. 'It is unfortunate that the only portions of my statement were publicized resulting in misrepresentation. As always, I will ensure that my focus continues to be on making West Virginia a better place to create jobs and raise a family.' Kurcaba, from Morgantown, West Virginia, is a financial adviser who was supported in his race by West Virginians for Life, an anti-abortion group.","Republican Brian Kurcaba said women who are raped should not abort their pregnancies and that the child that comes as a result is 'beautiful'

"A teenager mother who gave her baby daughter up for adoption in Alaska due to her 'lack of life experience' is still pumping and sending breast milk to the infant, it has emerged. Kaleena Pysher, 19, who lives in Anchorage, was in her senior year in high school when she discovered she was pregnant with her daughter, Raylie, last February. She quickly opted for adoption after deciding it would be 'selfish' for her to bring up the child in her young and 'inexperienced' position. At just four months' pregnant, she settled on an adoptive family. After Raylie was born last November, the baby's adoptive parents - who wish to remain anonymous - took her home after thanking Kaleena for her 'selfless' decision to 'give them the gift of life'. 'Selfless': Kaleena Pysher is still pumping and sending breast milk to her baby daughter, Raylie, after giving her up for adoption in Alaska due to her 'lack of life experience'. Above, Kaleena is pictured with Raylie . However, the teenager's input in her daughter's upbringing did not stop there. After hearing about the benefits of breast milk over formula, Kaleena knew she had to try breastfeeding for Raylie's sake. Now, she has been pumping and sending breast milk to her daughter's adoptive parents - whose location has not been disclosed - for nearly three months, despite it causing her pain. 'I'm doing this all out of love. Because I want the best thing for my daughter,' Kaleena, whose nipples often crack, bleed and scab over during the pumping, told the Alaska Dispatch News. The teenager, who is now training to become a dental assistant, discovered she was pregnant during a routine visit to the doctor. She was so shocked she took two home pregnancy tests to confirm it. In subsequent weeks, Kaleena, who was living with her parents in West Anchorage, decided to give her baby up for adoption. At 18, she felt she lacked the life experience needed to raise a child. 'When I first found out that I was pregnant, I knew I didn’t have the life experience to raise a baby, and I wasn’t going to be selfish… So, I decided for adoption,' she said. Mother and daughter: Kaleena, 19, decided she wanted to try breastfeeding after hearing about the benefits of breast milk over formula. Above, Kaleena is pictured with Raylie after giving birth to her last November . Keeping it fresh: Kaleena pumped her breast milk and stored it in a freezer (pictured), before shipping it to Raylie's adoptive parents in boxes marked 'Fresh Seafood - Keep Refridgerated' to ensure it stayed fresh . She also did not want to rely on her parents for help, nor go on welfare, the newspaper reported. So, she set about finding an adoptive family that she could trust to care for her daughter, before agreeing to an open adoption, which would allow her to play a role in the child's life. During her pregnancy, Kaleena said she 'bonded' with her baby. She also talked with the adoptive parents daily, sent ultrasound photos, and kept them up-to-date on the fetus's condition. 'I would tell them, ""Oh, she has the hiccups today"", or, ""She's moving around a lot today"",' she said. When she was seven months' pregnant, Kaleena spoke to a visiting nurse from the Southcentral Foundation’s Nutaqsiivik Nurse-Family Partnership program about breastfeeding. She then told the adoptive family she wanted to breastfeed Raylie  in the hospital and for the first few months of her life due to the antibodies and brain growth that breast milk could offer her. 'When a baby is fed breast milk, they are just way ahead of the game. I decided that I wanted my baby to have the best options and to be able to grow,' she said. When Kaleena gave birth nine days before her due date at the end of November, she held and breastfed her daughter. But when the adoptive parents arrived, she placed the baby in their arms. After that, she didn't hold her daughter again until a week later - and even then, she just held her for several minutes. 'I wanted my daughter to bond with them. They are raising her,' she said. Determined: Instead of going out with her friends, Kaleena (left, in a Facebook photo) would make sure she was at home so she could reattach herself to her breast pump every 120 minutes. Right, baby Raylie . Moving forward: Kaleena (pictured) is now weaning herself off the breast pump. But despite her breastfeeding having come to an end, she has been assured by the adoptive parents that she will still remain in Raylie's life . Over the next few weeks, Kaleena got into a routine of pumping breast milk for Raylie, who turned out to have a ferocious appetite. Every two hours, the teenager would pump the liquid and seal it in bags. Instead of going out with her friends, she would make sure she was at home so she could reattach herself to her breast pump every 120 minutes, often while watching TV shows on Netflix. Even when her breasts started to hurt, she plowed on. 'I just sucked it up and kept going,' she said. Kaleena stored the bags containing her breast milk in a freezer, before shipping them to Raylie's adoptive parents in boxes marked 'Fresh Seafood - Keep Refrigerated' to ensure the milk was fresh. The adoptive family paid for the shipping. Three months on, Kaleena has produced so much milk - at times, 6oz from each breast every two hours - that the parents have told her they have enough of it. The teenager now plans to donate the extra milk she has in her freezer to a milk bank in Colorado, where it will be screened and fed to premature babies in a neonatal intensive care unit. Kaleena is currently weaning herself off the breast pump. But despite her breastfeeding having come to an end, she has been assured by the adoptive parents that she will still remain in Raylie's life. 'They have told me that we are a family now. They say that I will always be her mother, and that they are appreciative of the gift of life I have given them,' Kaleena told TODAY.","Kaleena Pysher, of Alaska, gave birth to daughter, Raylie, last November .

"Jack White is incredibly serious when it comes to his music, and even more serious when it comes to his guacamole and bananas. The much admired American musician made an appearance at University of Oklahoma this week and, after getting their hands on his contract for the evening, the  student newspaper decided to let the world know all of White's crazy demands and backstage needs before he gets out on stage. It turns out however, that White may be one of the easiest stars ever when it comes to demands, asking for little and even skipping out on alcohol all together, but stressing one thing above all - that his homemade guacamole recipe is made just how he likes it. That and that there be no bananas anywhere in the building. Scroll down for video . Jack White's (above) backstage demands for a performance at the University of Oklahoma were published by the student newspaper .

White's amazing guacamole recipe from his rider . The Oklahoma Daily seemed less interested in then guacamole than in White was being paid that evening though, writing; 'White in the contract is guaranteed $80,000 versus the right to receive 90 percent of the amount earned from ticket sales, which have a net potential of a little over $147,000.' They did however attach the contract, which breaks down how White's guacamole is made. It starts with 8 'large, ripe Haas avocados' which are cut in chunks and combined with four 'vine-ripened tomatoes' diced, half of a chopped yellow onion, a bunch of chopped cilantro, four Serrano peppers that are both 'de-veined and chopped' and some salt and pepper to taste. This then gets gently mixed, so as not to mush up the avocados, and then covered with the avocado pits and the juice of half of a lime so the mixture does not brown. White suggests that it be made early, but not to early, and tossed in the refrigerator. The rider also states this is a 'no banana tour,' and then adds; 'We don't want to see bananas anywhere in the building.' The White Stripes frontman (above with Meg White) was upset the college published his $80,000 fee . Speaking of White, he was none too happy to have his rider go public, and a member of his team let it be known in a letter on his website. It said: 'The most important function of a rider is that it lays out optimal technical specifications to ensure the audience has the best experience possible. For that, Jack hires a team of very qualified touring professionals who write the rider and attempt to execute a professional and pleasant experience for all involved.' The letter the said; 'Part of that is making sure that the tour personnel of about 30 people plus the local venue staff are fed. Contrary to what some believe, Jack doesn’t write the rider nor make demands about his favorite snacks that must be in his dressing room.' Most importantly however, this letter makes one thing clear above all else. 'We recommend you try Lalo’s guacamole recipe,' says the author. 'It’s delicious.'","Jack White's backstage demands for a performance at the University of Oklahoma were published by the student newspaper .

"It is the most glittering and controversial fixture in the Conservative social calendar – the Black and White fundraising ball, which raises millions of pounds for party coffers. But organisers of the £15,000-a-table event have been so stung by adverse publicity about previous guests that they have banned table plans and place settings in an attempt to keep identities secret. Among the 1,100 guests expected at a five-star London hotel tomorrow are Sir Michael Hintze, the billionaire hedge fund manager who gave the Tories £1.5 million last year, and property developer David Rowland, a former tax exile, who has given more than £1.8 million to the Conservatives over four years. Organisers of the Tories' Black and White fundraising ball have banned table plans and place settings in an attempt to keep identities secret, pictured are David Cameron and his wife Samantha at the ball in 2008 . The ball's organisers were furious after last year's table plan fell into the hands of journalists – who calculated that the total worth of the guests came to more than £22 billion. They included Alexander Temerko, a Ukrainian-born energy magnate who sat on a table with the then Energy Minister Michael Fallon, along with two MPs, James Wharton and Alun Cairns, to whom he has donated money. In 2013, Mr Temerko paid £90,000 for a bust of David Cameron at a separate Conservative fundraiser just months after his renewable energy company received £4.5 million from the taxpayer. The leaked table plan also revealed that Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith, who is in charge of welfare reforms, was seated with directors of doorstep lending firm CLC Finance, which has advertised loans with annual rates of interest of up to 769.9 per cent. The Prime Minister, who usually attends the ball with his wife Samantha, will give the keynote speech.

"European laws on food labelling mean the details on the packaging of probiotic drinks are always rather vague . It started with those little bottles of sickly-sweet-tasting yogurt shots, and today probiotics can be found in everything from fortified milks and supplements to face creams – and all claim the ‘friendly bacteria’ they contain can do us a world of good. But tough European laws on food labelling mean the details on the packaging are always rather vague when it comes to explaining just what the benefits are, mainly because many studies have proved inconclusive. So are the positive effects little more than wishful thinking, or can probiotics really have the magical impact on our wellbeing that is claimed? Here we round up the best evidence for… . EASING IBS . THE PROBLEM: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common condition typically causing bouts of stomach cramps, bloating, diarrhoea and constipation. The exact causes are unknown, but most experts agree that IBS is a result of increased sensitivity in the gut. HOW PROBIOTICS HELP: Last year, consultant gastroenterologist Professor Ingvar Bjarnason led a placebo-controlled study at King’s College Hospital to investigate the effect of a live probiotic liquid on patients with IBS. He says: ‘We designed the trial using a probiotic drink called Symprove which contains four strains of bacteria, where many probiotics contain just one.’ During the trial, 186 patients with moderate to severe IBS took a daily dose of Symprove or a matching placebo liquid, for 12 weeks. ‘By week 12 there was a significant improvement in stomach pain in the Symprove group,’ says Prof Bjarnason. TRY: Symprove – but it costs £20 for a 500ml bottle which contains between eight to ten doses, and it must be taken daily to keep symptoms at bay. IMPROVING MOOD . THE PROBLEM: During the winter, up to 12 per cent of the population suffer from the low mood or depression known as Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD), thought to be caused by lack of daylight and Vitamin D. Most of the Vitamin D we absorb is obtained from the sun and helps to boost our mood. HOW PROBIOTICS HELP: A recent study found that taking a daily probiotic supplement could give SAD sufferers that little dose of sunshine they desperately need, boosting levels of Vitamin D by more than 25 per cent. The study’s lead author, Dr Mitchell Jones, commented: ‘Although it has long been known that the gastrointestinal tract plays an active role in the absorption of Vitamin D, these findings showing increased levels of Vitamin D after taking a probiotic orally are a first, and will inform the development of new products that may be beneficial for people with low Vitamin D levels.’ TRY: Bio-Kult (Vitamin D booster), which costs £14.95 for a box of 60 capsules. Take two a day. A recent study found that taking a daily probiotic supplement could give Seasonal Affective Disorder sufferers that little dose of sunshine they desperately need. File photo . SOOTHING ECZEMA . THE PROBLEM: About 20 per cent of babies and young children suffer from eczema – the dry, itchy skin condition typically treated with emollient lotions or low-dose steroid cream. Three-quarters of them will be clear of the condition by their teens, but taking a probiotic could help alleviate it in the meantime. HOW PROBIOTICS HELP: Dr Mayur Joshi is a medical adviser for Probiotics International Ltd and explains: ‘In a recent trial, infants were given traditional topical skin care for their eczema and then given either the probiotic mixture or placebo, which they added to milk, water or yogurt. The probiotic group showed a greater improvement in the severity of their symptoms than the placebo group, indicating that probiotics could be an effective therapy alongside standard treatment for eczema.’ TRY: Bio-Kult Infantis – it costs £11.95 for a box of 16 1g sachets of probiotic powder. Take half to one sachet per day, mixed with milk or other drink. BOOSTING IMMUNITY . THE PROBLEM: Part of our immune system – cells and organisms that protect us from bacterial and viral infections – is found in our gut. Scientists have looked to athletes who train hard to the point that their immune systems are under stress, in their quest for evidence that probiotics could play a role in boosting our general wellbeing. HOW PROBIOTICS HELP: Clinical pharmacist Mike Wakeman says: ‘A paper published in the International Journal Of Sports Science And Sports Medicine in 2012 concluded that athletes who took probiotic supplements suffered fewer symptoms of illness and recovered sooner than those who did not.’ TRY: Bio-Acidophilus Forte – £30.35 from revital.co.uk. One bottle contains 30 capsules; take one a day. Each capsule contains a staggering 30 billion viable cells of the unique LAB4 complex of probiotic cells which have been proven to help boost immunity. BEATING TRAVELLER’S TUM . THE PROBLEM: Traveller’s tum is caused by consuming food or water contaminated by germs, including bacteria, viruses and parasites. Alongside gastric symptoms, there can be high temperature, vomiting and abdominal pain. HOW PROBIOTICS HELP: Mike Wakeman says taking a probiotic during your holiday and for a week either side could help protect you. ‘A 2006 analysis of 34 trials comparing probiotics with placebo concluded that taking a probiotic before you travel can help to prevent diarrhoea while you’re overseas, with the probiotic strain L. acidophilus faring best,’ he says. A recent independent study found that there was a significant reduction in digestive problems in travellers who took the probiotic capsule Bimuno before and during an overseas trip. TRY: Bimuno TRAVELAID – £9.99 for 30 soft chewy pastilles. Benefits build over time; take three a day for seven days before your travels and every day while you are away. A Canadian study has found that popping a daily probiotic pill could aid weight loss. Those who took a probiotic lost an average of 10lb during the 12-week trial . AIDING WEIGHT LOSS . THE PROBLEM: You’re on a weight-loss plan and being strict about sticking to the ‘rules’, yet you’re not shedding pounds very quickly. Previous studies have shown that the intestinal flora of obese people differs from thin people – most likely due to a diet high in fat and low in fibre. So losing more weight could be as simple as resetting the balance of the gut with ‘good bacteria’. HOW PROBIOTICS HELP: A Canadian study has found that popping a daily probiotic pill could aid weight loss. Those who took a probiotic containing the lactobacillus rhamnosus strain lost an average of 10lb during the 12-week trial – that’s 4lb more than those who were on a placebo. TRY: Quest’s Mega8Biotix contains lactobacillus rhamnosus – the probiotic strain featured in the Canadian study, as well as seven other strains of lactobacilli bacteria. A month’s supply of capsules costs £18.99 and is available from all good independent pharmacies.","Probiotics can be found in everything from fortified milks to face creams .

"Prince Charles has arrived in the Middle East for a six-day tour that starts in Jordan - a country still in shock following the shocking murder of one of its pilots. The Prince of Wales stepped from his chartered jet looking relaxed and was greeted by a small entourage that included Britain's ambassador to Jordan, Peter Millett. Jordan as a nation is grieving after the brutal killing of 26-year-old Moaz al Kasasbeh by the Islamic State (ISIS) group. In gruesome footage, the terrorist group filmed the Jordanian pilot being burnt alive. Scroll down for video . Prince Charles has arrived in Jordan for a six-day tour of the Middle East - he will meet with King Abdullah II . The Prince of Wales talks to Prince Ghazi bin Muhammad after arriving in Jordan, a country still in shock following the gruesome killing of one of its pilots . The Prince goes to grip the hand of Prince Ghazi Bin Al-Muhammad as he embarks on a six-day tour . The Prince is presented with a tray of baklava tied in a red ribbon after touching down in Jordan . The Prince entertains a group of Iraqi Christians who sought refuge in Jordan having fled their home country . Following the sickening murder, Jordan's ruler King Abdullah II vowed to wage a 'harsh' war against ISIS and fighter jets carried out fresh attacks on ISIS on Thursday. More than 600,000 Syrian refugees have fled to Jordan to escape the civil war in their homeland, and in the past year large numbers of Syrian Christians have arrived following religious persecution by ISIS fighters. When Charles stepped on to the tarmac at Marka airport, he was greeted by the king's religious adviser Prince Ghazi Bin Muhammad and the two men walked along a red carpet that led from the plane to the Prince of Wales's waiting limousine. Their path was flanked by a ceremonial guard of honour which earlier had saluted the royal visitor. Charles then met Iraqi Christian refugees at the British ambassador's residence in Amman. The prince has been raising the plight of Orthodox Christians forced to flee their homes in Iraq and Syria by visiting, over the past year, those who have sought refuge in the UK. One of the refugees gave a speech about their plight telling Charles: 'This is the seventh month that we are away from our homes and we don't find any reason to return back. 'Moreover we don't want to do that because it is impossible to live with the people who destroyed our homes and destroyed our church. 'Those people were our neighbours whom we lived together many years ago but when Daesh (Islamic State) came, they directly became our enemy. And they deprived us of everything. So how can we return back and co exist with such people?' The Prince of Wales told the group of around ten people he met: 'This is what I think must be the worst of horrors when all the people you lived with, side by side and have always been friendly, suddenly totally change.' Charles will be joined in Jordan by International Development secretary Justine Greening as her department has provided financial aid to the country. The Prince will also hold  talks with the king tomorrow, with the civil war in Syria likely to be one of the topics under discussion. Surrounded by trays of nibbles, the Prince holds talks with Peter Millett, Britain's ambassador to Jordan .

Amnesty International UK has appealed to Charles to use his influence and 'pass on a few well chosen words' as he tours the Gulf, and raise the case of jailed Saudi blogger Raif Badawi, who faces a decade behind bars and 1,000 lashes. Kate Allen, Amnesty International UK director, said: 'We don't expect Prince Charles to give up the red carpets and state banquets and become a human rights campaigner, but as a man who knows the Middle East well we hope that he will use this visit to pass on a few well-chosen words to his royal hosts. 'We know that freedom of religion is an issue close to the Prince's heart, and in Saudi Arabia he will surely want to raise the outrageous case of Raif Badawi, the blogger jailed and flogged for discussing politics and religion on his website. 'We still need the UK government to do more on Raif's case, but Charles' diplomatic intercession could help secure this man's freedom.'

"A troubled Islamic school which is alleged to have sent £1million of public money to construct a sister establishment in Pakistan is in debt to the tune of almost £3million, Birmingham City Council has revealed. New leadership was brought into Al-Hijrah School last year, after the council forced out the old governors and sacked its headteacher amid claims of financial irregularities and poor standard of education. The scale of the voluntary-aided school's financial woes have been laid bare by Birmingham City Council which said auditors now believed the school's estimated deficit by the end of this financial year would be 'in the region of over £3million'. It comes as a council inquiry continues into allegations £1million of public money sent to the Bordesley Green school found its way to funding construction of a school in Pakistan. Late last year, the new council-backed executive headteacher informed parents the taxpayer was shelling out £470,000 in rent and classroom hire costs just to keep the gates open. Troubled: Al-Hijrah School in Birmingham is in debt to the tune of almost £3million, the council has revealed . Al-Hijrah, described on its website as 'an Islamic school providing high quality education for 4-16-year-olds' has been in special measures after a damning Ofsted inspection in December 2013. In May last year, a Government-backed interim executive board (IEB) took over the running the school, and has been tackling what Ofsted recently called 'a number of financial irregularities' left over from the time of the previous regime. The council said the massive deficit is 'due to the financial situation we inherited'. It has also warned the figure is likely to grow because the council has 'a duty to improve the school environment and ensure the children have access to the resources they deserve'. While the liability is the school's, the deficit is included on the cash-strapped council's own balance sheet. It recently emerged in a letter from the then executive headteacher Graham Hardy that before the old school governors were pushed out, they had renegotiated the site lease from a peppercorn rate of £1 up to £300,000. Mr Hardy said the cash was payable annually to the Al-Hijrah Trust, which manages the site, and that 'the money is taken from the budget allocated by the local authority to employ teachers and provide resources'. The annual budget for running the school is £3million, which is Government money given to Al-Hijrah through the council. In his letter, Mr Hardy said the school buildings, which are still the Al-Hijrah Trust's responsibility to maintain, had several 'serious' issues including a leaking roof that could cost up to £500,000 to repair. He told parents the school was also having to pay £170,000-a-year for temporary on-site classrooms. It was only when the IEB gained access to the school last year, the scale of its problems became clear. A council inquiry continues into allegations £1million of public money sent to the Bordesley Green school found its way to funding construction of a school in Pakistan . The new leadership has since had to buy £12,000 of dining tables and chairs after finding pupils had been eating meals while sat on the floor. Parents were also told £32,177 had to be spent on pupil safeguarding, including secure external doors and working CCTV. Following a full structural survey of the site, a £16,000 electrical fault was uncovered, while engineers found 'serious issues' with the school's badly leaking roof, which could cost up to £500,000 to fix. Alongside its financial problems, the previous leadership team had failed to introduce a new national curriculum last year or appoint enough teachers. The school has since had to pay £15,000 towards new curriculum materials and training, including the hire of a consultant. A council spokesman said: 'The overall deficit, taking account of the overspending from the previous financial year is likely to be in excess of £3million. 'Further discussions will be taking place to determine cost implications for next year's budget. This is due to the financial situation we inherited. 'It will effectively add to the deficit but we obviously have a duty to improve the school environment and ensure the children have access to the resources they deserve."" It added that the revised predicted deficit is based on 'all known outstanding commitments from previous and the current financial years', and includes a revenue liability of more than £600,000 rolled over from the year ending April 2014. Meanwhile, a separate inquiry into an allegation up to £1 million of public money sent to the trust running school, before its takeover, found its way to fund school construction in Pakistan is 'on-going'. 'Birmingham City Council has received a large amount of information regarding the financial status of the school and continues to work with other statutory agencies to identify how funds have been expended,' the spokesman said. The school was not linked to the Trojan Horse allegations which emerged in March, last year.","Al-Hijrah School in Birmingham in debt by almost £3million, council reveals .

"For American visitors, it is one of Britain's more common tourist traps - the struggle to pronounce place names such as Leicester Square, Worcester and Edinburgh. Now a new Google invention hopes to help those struggling by offering audio examples of names of commonly mispronounced sites, based purely on recordings of they are spoken locally. The newly-patented technology by the web giant could be implanted into Google Maps, saving future tourists the embarrassment of tripping over the name of Britain's commonly mis-stated landmarks. Scroll down for video . Google's guide will ask locals to record place names to find out the most common way. If it comes to fruition, multiple recordings of how locals say a particular word would be submitted and uploaded to a server. From there, Google would assess the recordings to attach the word's most common pronunciation to the place name on Google Maps. This function could be handy, as Google says in the patent, 'when traveling in a foreign country.' 'Systems and methods are provided to select a most typical pronunciation of a location name on a map from a plurality of user pronunciations,' the application says. 'A server generates a reference speech model based on user pronunciations, compares the user pronunciations with the speech model and selects a pronunciation based on comparison.' 'Alternatively, the server compares the distance between one the user pronunciations and every other user pronunciations and selects a pronunciation based on comparison. Google could determine the most common pronunciation of a place name from audio clips submitted by locals. This could then be used to find the most common pronunciation. Software could then find the most common recorded file, and play it to users when someone searches for the place on Google Maps. 'The server then annotates the map with the selected pronunciation and provides the audio output of the location name to a user device upon a user's request.' The place name used in the patent filing is Worcester  - the name of a city in the UK, and also of one in South Africa and ten places in the US—and it is pronounced slightly differently in each country. Google said the patent doesn't necessarily mean that Google will be adding this functionality to its maps anytime soon: 'Some of those ideas later mature into real products or services, some don't,' a spokeswoman said. Google also recently officially launched speech translation as part of its Translate app. Both iOS and Android users can now talk to the app and get a written translation of what they're saying, in real time, on the screen. The move builds on Google's current tools, which offer written translation of 90 languages, as well  spoken translations in a select number of languages on Android devices. Google could determine the most common pronunciation of a place name from audio clips submitted by locals. This could then be used to find the most common pronunciation . 'Often the hardest part of travelling is navigating the local language,' said Barak Turovsky, product lead for Google Translate. 'Now Google Translate can be your guide in new ways. Asking for directions to the Rive Gauche, ordering bacalhau in Lisbon, or chatting with your grandmother in her native Spanish just got a lot faster.'","Names such as Leicester Square and Worcester commonly mispronounced .

"She was 19, a brand-new mother with a developmental disability. Two days after giving birth to her daughter, the state took the infant away and placed her in foster care. Massachusetts child welfare officials contend the young woman couldn't properly care for a newborn and insist they acted in the child's best interests. But the federal government disagrees: It says the state violated her civil rights by discriminating against her because of her disability. In a new report, the Justice Department and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services say the state Department of Children and Families — which has moved to terminate the mother's parental rights — needs to compensate her and give her a chance to prove she can care for her daughter, or it could face a federal lawsuit. The National Council on Disability, an independent federal agency advising the White House and Congress, says the case points up a growing problem: states needlessly taking custody of the children of disabled parents. The Massachusetts Department of Children and Families violated the law when it took away a 19-year-old's two-day-old infant just because the mother was mentally disabled . 'Parents with disabilities are suffering significant discrimination,' said Robyn Powell, an attorney for the council. 'What happened to this mother is very common ... States are removing these children for the sole reason of their parents having a disability.' Now 21, and identified in the federal report only by the pseudonym 'Sara Gordon,' the young woman's ordeal began as she was still recovering from childbirth in November 2012. Federal authorities describe her as having a 'mild intellectual disability' that makes it difficult for her to read and follow verbal instructions. They say she requires 'repetition, hands-on instruction and frequency' to learn new things such as how to feed a baby and change diapers. 'DCF staff assumed that Ms. Gordon was unable to learn how to safely care for her daughter because of her disability, and, therefore, denied her the opportunity to receive meaningful assistance,' said the two federal agencies, which conducted a joint civil rights investigation. Their 26-page report, dated Jan. 29, says Massachusetts should provide the mother with services and support so she can have a shot at regaining custody of her daughter; pay damages to the family; and withdraw a petition to terminate the mother's parental rights that's currently in state court. They also called for broader changes, saying the case highlights 'systemic failures by DCF to ensure social workers follow appropriate policies and procedures and have necessary training to perform their duties without discriminating on the basis of disability.' The National Council on Disability has documented similar cases across the country, including a Kansas City, Missouri, couple who had their daughter taken into state custody because they were both blind, and a quadriplegic mother in Chicago who waged a lengthy legal battle to keep custody of her son. In the past, state child welfare officials have defended placing such children in foster care out of grave concerns for their adequate care and well-being. Cayenne Isaksen, a DCF spokeswoman, said the agency will be responding to the federal government's report. 'DCF believes it acted in the best interest of the child,' she said, without elaborating. Through their lawyers, the young mother and her family declined requests by The Associated Press to be interviewed. Their lawyers said community service providers support the family's plan to care for the little girl, who is now 2. The grandparents want to be designated as the child's legal guardians and have promised to continue helping their daughter, who lives with them, learn to care for the toddler. 'This mother has good supports. There are no issues of substance abuse or domestic violence,' said Mark Watkins, a lawyer for the mother. 'I have complete confidence in the ability of this family to parent this child safely.' Watkins said the mother, who is working to finish her high school degree, hasn't given up on her daughter — visiting her regularly and taking courses to improve her parenting skills. 'She has been resilient. She's been disappointed at nearly every turn by the court and the department,' Watkins said. 'But she has never stopped trying. She never quit. A lesser person would have given up by now.'","Massachusetts child welfare services took a two-day-old infant away from her disabled mother and placed her in foster care .

"Pro-Russian separatists have intensified shelling on Ukrainian government forces as world leaders try to hammer out a desperate peace deal to calm violence in the embattled country. Seven civilians and five Ukrainian troops were killed during fighting in eastern Ukraine today - and at least 26 soldiers have been injured - government and rebel officials confirmed. A recent upsurge in violence has forced France and Germany's leaders to intervene - in a bid to broker a new peace treaty between warring sides. But there is no guarantee the talks will work, German Chancellor Angela Merkel told an international security conference in Munich today. Scroll down for video .

Supplies: Ukraine's president Petro Poroshenko has called for more weapons to be sent to his country . German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Francois Hollande - who have visited both Ukraine and Russia's capitals this week - are trying to strike a desperate deal to end the fighting. The two leaders plan to discuss the proposals, which could include greater autonomy for the separatists' eastern region, in a phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko tomorrow. Speaking to France 2 television, Hollande said the plan being negotiated would feature a 50 to 70km demilitarised zone being established. He called for 'rather strong' autonomy in the east, adding: 'These people have gone to war... It will be difficult to make them share a common life.' Their aim is to draw up a joint agreement to enforce a peace treaty signed in Belarus in September, which has been violated by both sides. Merkel said today: 'This conflict cannot be resolved by military means. It is all the more important now to set out substantial steps that serve to fill with life the Minsk agreement.' Asked whether there are any guarantees any new agreement will not suffer the same fate as the last one, she replied that 'there are no theoretical guarantees' but says it is 'worth making this attempt'. She added: 'After such experiences, I am very cautious with guarantees. The guarantee can only be keeping to what has been agreed... but the answer can't be not to make any more agreements.

'Frozen': Poroshenko has said he wants a quick end to the fighting - saying it must be resolved and not 'frozen' Troubled: Poroshenko said there was 'no temporary solution' and his country stands ready for a 'comprehensive and immediate ceasefire' However, Poroshenko has pushed for a quick ceasefire in his country's troubled east, insisting that the conflict must be resolved and not 'frozen', while pressing Kiev's case to be supplied with defensive weapons. Poroshenko told the Munich Security Conference that Ukraine stands ready for a ""comprehensive and immediate ceasefire"" and Russia should be too. He indicated he did not want any peacekeepers in eastern Ukraine, saying they would not be needed if foreign fighters were withdrawn and the Ukraine-Russia border sealed. Then, he said, there would be 'peace and stability in Ukraine ... within a couple of weeks'. 'There is no temporary solution - this conflict must be resolved, not frozen,' he added, alluding to long-time conflicts involving breakaway regions in Georgia and Moldova. Ready: Poroshenko said he hoped Russia, and Putin, were also ready to bring an end to the fighting . Co-operate: Putin said Russia was ready to co-operate with international efforts to bring peace to the region . Borders:  Poroshenko has said he does not want any peacekeepers in eastern Ukraine - but does want the border with Russia sealed . Putin, meanwhile, stressed Russia's aim was to co-operate. At a trade union congress in the resort city of Sochi came, Putin said: 'We don't intend to war with anyone. We intend to cooperate with all.' But he complained of 'attempts to hold back our development by various means'. Afterwards, Putin was pictured looking relaxed at a celebration marking the first anniversary of the opening of the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympic Games.

War torn: Pro-Russian separatists (pictured) are thought to have killed over one thousand government troops . More than 5,300 people have been killed since fighting began in April according to the UN, and the bloodshed has markedly increased over the past two weeks prompting another desperate plea for diplomacy. Separatist forces appear to be amassing on the eastern town of Debaltseve, which lies between two major rebel-controlled regions, and the coastal city of Mariupol, which has already seen heavy bombing. Reports from Debaltseve yesterday said Ukrainian forces laid down mortar and howitzer fire from the town during an operation to evacuate civilians. Russia's Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov has said he 'sincerely' hopes this latest diplomatic effort will produce results but warned against arming Kiev's troops - and blamed the United States and Europe for inflaming the crisis.

Following talks between the Russian, French and German leaders on Friday, he said: 'We believe that there are good grounds for optimism, to issue recommendations for conflict resolution. Speaking during a debate at a security conference in Munich, he also pointed to growing calls in the West to 'pump Ukraine full of lethal weapons.' He added: 'This position will only exacerbate the tragedy of Ukraine.' 'I am sure that Russia will be among those parties that will guarantee the implementation of this agreement. But you can only guarantee what has already been achieved.' Conflict: The UN estimates more than 5,000 people have died as a result of fighting in Eastern Ukraine since last April .

Territory: Armed pro-Russian rebels (pictured) control the area near Donetsk airport in eastern Ukraine . Both the United States and other Western countries claim Russia has supplied troops and equipment to the separatists in eastern Ukraine, which Russia has denied. The recent resurgence in fighting has prompted the US to consider giving lethal weapons to Ukraine. But European nations fear the move will simply make the situation worse. Angela Merkel said: 'The problem is that I cannot imagine any situation in which improved equipment for the Ukrainian army leads to President Putin being so impressed that he believes he will lose militarily.' Merkel held a three-way meeting with Poroshenko and US Vice President Joe Biden after her appearance at the conference. US Secretary of State John Kerry also was in Munich for the annual gathering of foreign and security policy leaders.","Five Ukrainian soldiers died and 26 have been injured in the past 24 hours .

"For some people, even the mere thought of running a race is enough to make them shiver. But one daredevil was literally left quaking in his boots after subjecting himself to one of the most physically demanding challenges known to man - the annual Tough Guy Race. James Appleton, a 28-year-old adventure and travel photographer from Wirral, was initially unable to celebrate coming in third place in the race in Wolverhampton, because he was suffering from severe hypothermia. Tough Guy is among the extreme assault courses offered in the UK to test people to their limits . The race features an array of obstacles to over come amid treacherous conditions - hot and cold, mud and even electric shocks. The website for the extreme assault course explains: 'Tough Guy is a window of opportunity to test oneself, on every discipline in life, in one day.' In footage shot at the event, James can seen paddling through freezing waters. 'After the under water tunnel I lost all sense of time', James slurs afterwards. 'I didn't really know what was going on.' As his body temperature plummets, the participant is unable to speak properly and lacked coordination. In the clip from the upcoming documentary, 28-year-old James Appleton can be seen taking part . He is immediately thrown into a warm shower to recover after people rush to help him and remove his ice cold clothing since he is pretty much incapable. At the end of the clip, James is standing over a fire and holds a blanket around him to keep the heat in. He is questioned by the cameraman as to why he was motivated to take up such a ludicrous challenge - 'Will you tell me why you run this?' James, who has completed five winter Tough Guy races and seven summer ones, struggles to answer: 'Uh... I don't really know any more.' This year's race was won by  by John Albon from Norway, who is videoed helping James into a hot shower after the event. Speaking exclusively to MailOnline, James says that it is hard to describe how it feels to know you're become increasingly hypothermic and still want to carry on and race. 'Any normal sane person would take the first chance to get into the warm and raise their body temperature back to normal, but when you're racing you have to deal with the knowledge it's going to get a lot, lot worse before it gets any better. 'I go into pretty heavy shut-down but I know that whatever happens, if I keep dragging myself forwards I'll make it to the end, and just hope I can do it quickly enough to finish well. It's a bit of a never surrender attitude, and it does work. He also admits that this is not the first time he has subjected himself to hypothermia, although that did not put him off doing it all over again. 'When I won in 2009 I spent four hours in an aid station afterwards, but I think this year I may have been worse than that - fortunately I had people looking out for me at the finish this time round. At times James is suffering so much from hypothermia that he can barely walk and sways from side to side . There is panic in the voices of the two men supporting James as they realise how cold he is . 'I do Tough Guy mostly for the competitive side - I want to go back each year to race the event and do as well as I can. 'That said, I also find it gives you a ""reset"" where you start the year with a challenge, the pride of completing it, and then the memory of the physical and mental destruction to compare the rest of your year too - it makes everything else seem much tamer!' James is used to putting himself through  challenges and feats of endurance, from running from coast-to-coast across Britain, to wilderness hikes in the Arctic Circle or climbing erupting volcanos in winter. The competitor comes third but barely has time to celebrate before race winner John Albon rushes him to have a hot shower . Even after the hot shower and standing by an open fire, James can't stop physically shaking . His friends and family are supportive however, he reassures, 'though for the most part it's something they would never do themselves. 'The one person I wish was still around to show all of this to would be my maternal grandfather - he was an incredible mountaineer who climbed in the Himalaya with Edmund Hillary, and a huge inspiration to how I want my life to be. 'I like to this he'd have been proud of my racing achievements within this sport.' What advice would James give to somebody entering one of those races? 'Get your clothing right and practice the feeling of sudden cold water in safety. I choose to wear lighter layers because I want to be fast, but in reality the safest thing is to rely on neoprene and merino wool layers.' He explains that its important for racers to know how it feels to suddenly drop into cold water so that they don't panic on the day. 'You can do this at home in your shower or in a safely shallow outdoor lake,' he advises. 'But have someone standing by the first time in case it really shocks you, and never jump into deep water - always somewhere you can stand up if it gets too much.'","James Appleton, 28, was unable to celebrate as he had hypothermia .

"She sent her daughter to private school rather than entrusting her education to the state. But now Emma Thompson has decided the best results require a more unconventional route – and has removed her from school altogether. The actress has had a purpose-built classroom constructed in the back garden after 15-year-old Gaia complained that she did not enjoy formal education. Gaia - pictured here with her famous parents Emma Thompson and Greg Wise - has decided main stream education isn't for her . Her husband Greg Wise said that Gaia 'loves learning', but felt that preparing for GCSEs at school 'wasn't for her'. The actor said: '[Gaia] is terribly focused and hard-working, but she didn't like the sausage factory of formal education. I've no argument with that.' The 48-year-old added that he and Miss Thompson are yet to decide what their daughter should be taught, joking: 'I think we should just teach Latin and free-form dance. Really.' Gaia will be joining up to 60,000 other children in England and Wales who are home-schooled – and as such will not have to follow the national curriculum. But this sense of the unknown seems to suit Mr Wise, who told The Times: 'I read a fascinating statistic recently that said 60 per cent of the kids at school will go on to do jobs that haven't yet been invented.' Miss Thompson caused a stir last year when she revealed that she sent her daughter to a private school near their home in West Hampstead, North London. The Oscar-winning actress, who has been a renowned supporter of Left-wing politics, said at the time she hoped Gaia would attend sixth-form at the state-run Camden School for Girls. However it is not known if she will still do so. The 55-year-old star of Saving Mr Banks was educated there herself when it was still a grammar school. It remains a favourite of wealthy Left-wing parents, with alumni including actress Tamsin Greig and the children of several Blairite cabinet ministers. Miss Thompson has previously urged parents to take a year off work to spend more time with their children. She recently put her own Hollywood career on hold, and said: 'You can't be a great mum and keep working all the time. Wise told The Times Magazine that the 'sausage factory of formal education' was not right for her, so the couple have built a classroom in their garden . Gaia is the younger of Thompson's two children: she and Wise also informally adopted Tindyebwa Agaba (pictured right) when he was 16-years-old . 'A year off was my birthday present to myself. I didn't actually act or write. I was just a mum. I taught drama at my daughter's school, cooked meals and had fun. I highly recommend others to do the same if they can afford it.' She said she had decided that it wasn't always possible to juggle parenthood and a career, explaining: 'Motherhood is a full-time job. 'The only way I could have continued working would have been by delegating the running of the home to other people.' Miss Thompson and Mr Wise – who appeared together in the 1995 adaptation of Sense and Sensibility – also have a 28-year-old son, Tindyebwa Agaba. The couple adopted the former Rwandan child soldier when he was 16. Thompson took a year off to spend with her two children, saying she would 'highly recommend' it to people - if they can afford it .","Gaia, 15, decided before her GCSEs that she wanted to be home schooled .

"Cleone Augur (pictured) is the great-granddaughter of Harry Selfridge and  says his story is even stranger than the fiction shown on the hit ITV show . Fans of the ITV series Mr Selfridge probably think they know everything about the colourful American tycoon – from his trim, dark beard to his compulsive womanising and betrayal of his long-suffering wife. But the truth about Harry Gordon Selfridge is very much stranger than that told in the hit show, according to one surviving member of his family. Cleone Augur, the great-granddaughter of the man who revolutionised British shopping, says the real story of Mr Selfridge and his family includes Russian assassins, showgirls, drug scandals, a slide into poverty – and a bizarre tale of smuggled bull semen. Mrs Augur has never spoken in public about the series and says she watches the show under sufferance. But when she was tracked down by The Mail on Sunday she was keen to set the record straight on a couple of key points: Harry Gordon Selfridge was not unfaithful, she insists – and he didn’t even have a beard. ‘Mr Selfridge is a story which is entertaining for the masses, but it is not necessarily fact,’ she says with withering precision. ‘I was particularly annoyed by the portrayal of my great-grandfather. 'He did not have affairs when his wife was alive, though he went slightly bananas after she died in the flu pandemic in 1918. ‘He made some bad decisions. He had a good time with the ladies, particularly the Dolly sisters, identical twin dancers who helped him spend his money. 'Then he discovered that one of them was taking a lot of drugs and he severed the relationship. ‘And I was disappointed that Jeremy Piven has a beard – my great-grandfather never wore one.’ Last Sunday, Mrs Augur watched a portrayal of her own grandmother Rosalie – Selfridge’s daughter (played by Kara Tointon) – getting married in style to a Russian emigre, the rakish aviation pioneer Prince Serge de Bolotoff. A shot from season three of Mr Selfridge, starring Jeremy Piven (pictured third from right) as Harry Selfridge . An undated photograph showing Harry Selfridge with his daughter Rosalie - Mrs Augur's grandmother . Mrs Augur says: ‘I thought Kara was very good as my grandmother, but they got the dates wrong. 'I do know they all broke glasses [during a toast] but the wedding was completely different. 'They married in a private ceremony at the chapel of the Russian Embassy in London.’ Mrs Augur was not convinced, either, by Zoë Wanamaker’s portrayal of the groom’s mother, Princess Marie, as a grasping woman. ‘My great-grandmother was a deeply religious woman and wasn’t on the make,’ she says. ‘Her family had estates all over Russia but lost everything. Her husband disappeared with the secret police at some stage and never came back. Princess Marie Wiazemsky (pictured left) and Serge and Tatiana Wiazemsky with their baby Rosalie (right) ‘And I’m not convinced they are particularly accurate about grandpapa, who was quite a nervous chap. He was always worried that he was going to be assassinated by his political enemies in Russia. ‘When he came over here, he had a Cossack who used to sleep across the bedroom door, which my grandmother found quite trying, as you can imagine. ‘Grandpapa was quite witty and charming and had an eye for the ladies, but I never heard any stories that he was tempted to go off with anyone else.’ Now 70, Mrs Augur says Selfridge lavished money on his four children – Rosalie, Violette, Harry Jnr and Beatrice – and bankrolled their husbands. Mrs Augur with the wedding dress that was handed down to her from grandmother Rosalie Wiazemsky . Rosalie’s husband Serge tried – and failed – to become the first man to fly across the English Channel after the Daily Mail offered a £1,000 prize in 1908. After their marriage, the couple lived with Selfridge in London’s Portman Square while Serge started a short-lived aviation company that only ever made one machine – a two-seat utility biplane that was illustrated in the 1919 edition of Jane’s All The World’s Aircraft. Despite his lack of success, the family enjoyed a wonderful sailing trip to Deauville in France on Selfridge’s steam yacht, Conqueror, as well as playing tennis on the roof of the department store and sitting in the front row at show premieres. Selfridge even installed a soda fountain in the store for his eldest daughter. Eventually, Selfridge’s spending spiralled out of control as the Great Depression hit his profits, and he was ousted from the board in 1941. When he ran into money troubles he moved to a flat in Putney, South-West London, with Serge, Rosalie and Mrs Augur’s mother, Tatiana. ‘He didn’t have any money,’ Mrs Augur recalls. ‘My grandmother once turned the bailiffs away and she had to go and work in the finance department at Selfridges. ‘She didn’t want to be recognised, so she took the name Mrs Rose Lee.’ Selfridge died in penury in 1947, at the age of 90. Mrs Augur was just three years old. Despite their troubles, Tatiana was a debutante and married Craig Wheaton-Smith, grandson of the Conservative MP Sir Ernest Craig. They moved to Somerset, where Wheaton-Smith worked as a farmer and geneticist. He was the author of the book Breeding Better Cows. There was, however, one more scandal to hit the family. An undated picture of Harry Gordon Selfridge with his mother, Lois,  in London - she died in 1924 . Wheaton-Smith was arrested for smuggling semen from French Charolais cattle into Britain, which was used to inseminate Ayrshire cows belonging to Lord Beaverbrook and British Agriculture adviser Sandy Copeland. ‘They stored the semen in my grandmother’s fridge which she thought was outrageous,’ Mrs Augur reveals. ‘The resulting calves were exhibited at the Bath and West Show, but my father felt a hand on his shoulder in 1965 and was fined £50 for smuggling. ‘It was an extraordinary story but actually it has changed the dairy industry.’ In spite of their straitened circumstances, the family retained strong ties with Selfridges after its founder was ousted – Tatiana even had a discount card. ‘Sadly the links have been severed now,’ says Mrs Augur. ‘It’s a shame because I would have loved that discount card.’ Harry Gordon Selfridge (centre) at the christening of his granddaughters Rosalie and Violette in Chicago .","Cleone Augur is the great-granddaughter of tycoon Harry Selfridge .

"With a storyline centred on the class divide, it was acclaimed as the novel which showed J.K. Rowling could address adult issues as well as she could weave magic for children in the Harry Potter books. But now the BBC has come under fire over its adaptation of her novel The Casual Vacancy just weeks before the General Election. The broadcaster has been accused of ramping up Left-wing issues in the book – by adding scenes which do not even appear in the novel. Controversy: The BBC has come under fire over its adaptation of JK Rowling's novel The Casual Vacancy just weeks before the General Election . The three-part drama, which starts next Sunday and stars Sir Michael Gambon, Keeley Hawes and Rory Kinnear, paints a bleak picture of life in modern Britain and features storylines involving rape, drug abuse and racism. Set in the fictitious English town of Pagford, it features a community of rich and poor at war over the future of a community centre called Sweetlove House, home to social services including a drug rehabilitation centre and a food bank. Pagford’s wealthier residents, who are fed up with the centre being a haven for ‘junkies and plebs’ from a nearby council estate called The Fields, want to close it for good and turn it into a luxury hotel and spa. They are bitterly opposed by the liberal faction on Pagford parish council who believe it is essential for social cohesion. Tory MP and former Foreign Secretary Sir Malcolm Rifkind said the timing of the broadcast struck him as being ‘very odd at least’. He said: ‘In the run-up to a General Election, the Government quite rightly has to go into purdah and refrain from doing anything provocative. I think the BBC should have to apply the same criteria.’ The drama does not mention any political parties but critics say the battle over Sweetlove House is a thinly disguised attack on the Government’s welfare cuts, which will be one of the crucial issues for the May 7 Election. In an interview in The Mail on Sunday, Rowling defended herself against accusations that her novel was a Left-wing attack on the middle classes. She said: ‘I’m not anti-middle class in the slightest. Adaptation: The three-part drama, which starts next Sunday and stars Sir Michael Gambon (left) paints a bleak picture of life in modern Britain and features storylines involving rape, drug abuse and racism . 'Look at me! I am very pro people putting time and money and effort into trying to improve the world. And the middle classes do that very, very well. SCENE 1 . The BBC: In the opening scenes, Councillor Howard Mollison, played by Sir Michael Gambon, and his social-climbing wife Shirley (Julia McKenzie) discuss plans for a luxury hotel and spa development. A gleeful Shirley tells her husband: ‘It’s beautiful. You feel better just looking at it. You can’t let Barry Fairbrother and his tribe of do-gooders stand in the way of progress. They’ll have to accept that Sweetlove House has had its day.’ In the novel: The plan for a luxury hotel and spa does not appear at all. SCENE 2 . The BBC: Opposing the plans, Councillor Fairbrother says: ‘That is social engineering. That’s apartheid. Herding people into ghettos because they don’t fit the aesthetic. There is a name for that, isn’t there. Bill, you stormed the Normandy beaches didn’t you, fighting fascism... That house helps people to live. The parish council is not here to make a quick buck for someone who already has more than enough... Is the legacy still of benefit? Yes. It has never been so important.’ In the novel: Councillor Fairbrother dies on page two having hardly uttered a word. SCENE 3 . The BBC: When progressive councillor Parminder Jawanda tells her colleagues that drug addicts will have to travel to nearby Yarvil to get help, a rival tells her: ‘They would crawl on their knees over broken glass if there were drugs to be had.’ In the novel: She uses far milder language, saying addicts should have their benefits cut. 'I would be the last person to deny that, being middle class myself.’ BBC publicity states the drama is about ‘a town at war, rich at war with poor, teenagers at war with their parents, wives at war with their husbands, teachers at war with their pupils’. The BBC adaptation also contains several explosive scenes not included in the novel. Councillor Barry Fairbrother dies in the first two pages of the book, but in the screenplay he lives long enough in the show to liken the closure of Sweetlove House to ‘fascism’ and ‘apartheid’. BBC guidelines state that dramas which deal with controversial subjects should be flagged up in advance and that on occasion it may be appropriate to offer alternative views in other ‘signposted’ output. Tory MP Angie Bray, a member of the Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee, said: ‘This drama does appear to be sailing very close to the wind. ‘It won’t be the first time the BBC has shown this kind of bias in its drama output.’ Broadcaster Melvyn Bragg defended the BBC’s right to adapt the work of a novelist who he insisted was partisan and political in the same way as Dickens. The Labour peer said: ‘This is a political novel in the sense that it is addressing what happens when society cuts off those people who they think are inadequate.’ Sarah Phelps, who wrote the screen adaptation, said: ‘The story is less about party politics and more about community. 'It’s a great rallying call for humanitarianism and to see ourselves as absolutely connected and linked to each other.’ The BBC defended the timing, saying rules governing what could be broadcast before an election kicked in on March 30. A spokesman said: 'BBC One is proud to bring J.K. Rowling's global best-seller and first novel for adults - from one of Britain's most popular authors - to the screen. 'It is a work of fiction which explores universal themes about family and social responsibility and does not mention party politics.'","BBC is under fire over its adaptation of JK Rowling's The Casual Vacancy .

"Twins who had to be resuscitated moments after being born ten weeks prematurely have finally recovered enough to go home. Parents Mark and Hayley Steabler, both 31, today described the terrifying moment they watched as a team of 11 medics battled to save their newborns at Tyneside District Hospital. Since then siblings Jack and Erin Steabler have battled conditions such as a bleed on the brain, and heart and lung problems, but have now gone home after nearly four months. Scroll down for video . Home: Mark and Hayley Steabler, both 31, are back at home with twins Jack and Erin Steabler, aged four months, after the pair were caught in a desperate struggle for life after being born ten weeks premature . Fight: Mr Steabler described how he watched a team of 11 medics working to get baby Jack to breathe just seconds after he was born, saying he was 'terrified' Holding on: After being resuscitated the babies then battled through conditions including bleeding on the brain, and heart and lung problems . Mr Steabler said: 'I remember seeing doctors just working on Jack, trying to get him breathing again, and I just felt terrified. 'We didn't know what was going to happen to either of them, and that's the worst feeling in the world.' Mark's wife, Hayley, 31, suffered no complications during her pregnancy and during her 20-week scan the couple were told they would be having twins. But at 30 weeks, Hayley suddenly went into labour and was taken to South Tyneside District Hospital. Mark, of Blackfell, Washington, said: 'They had hoped to transfer us to Newcastle's Royal Victoria Infirmary, but there was no time and she underwent an emergency Caesarean Section. 'They brought in a team of medics from the RVI. There were about 10 or 11 of them all in theatre with us ready to help.'

Seconds after they were born, Jack weighing 3lb 5oz and Erin 2lb 5oz, the team realised the babies were not breathing properly and began trying to resuscitate them. Mark said: 'Hayley and I didn't know what was going to happen. Because they were so small we knew they would have problems breathing by themselves. We'd had no sleep and were shattered.' Both children were put on ventilators to help them breath and transferred to the University Hospital of North Tees where they spent the next two months in special care. Jack had suffered a bleed on the brain while Erin had problems after she vomited blood. The pair were then transferred up to the RVI where they spent another month before finally being allowed home just a few weeks ago. Mark said the pair, now four months old, are slowly starting to recover. Recovery: Jack has a heart murmur which will require surgery, and Erin is being tube fed, but both are now back at home and on the road to recovery . He said: 'Jack does have a heart murmur which means he will need an operation in the future. He also has to have some scans this week to keep a check on any concerns about blood on the brain. 'Erin is on a feeding machine 24 hours a day at the minute. Obviously the last few months have been a lot of work for us. Because there are two of them, it's double the worry.' Mark, an insurance investigator, has been forced to take time off work, while Hayley is currently on maternity leave from her job as a manager for a plumber's merchant. Now, Mark, along with some work colleagues, is planning to take part in the Yorkshire Three Peaks Challenge in a bid to raise money for the RVI's Tiny Lives appeal.

Mr Love, assigned to 'field and social media' work for the Conservatives, completed a masters degree in business administration after leaving the White House. He was a star basketball player at college and played forward for the Duke Blue Devils - playing on the 2001 side that won the NCAA national championship. Mr Love, who is 6ft 5in, recently published a book about his time with the President called Power Forward. Recruited by Tories: The former college basketball star, pictured with Obama left, has been assigned to 'field and social media' work for David Cameron's campaign . In it he writes: 'I was his DJ, his Kindle, his travel agent, his valet his daughters basketball coach, his messenger, his punching bag, his alarm clock, his vending machine, his chief of stuff, his note passer, his spades partner, his caterer, his small forward, his buffer, his gatekeeper, his surrogate son, and ultimately, improbably, luckily, his friend.' As Obama's assistant he travelled almost 900,000 miles at the president's side and formed such a close bond with him that he had two tattoos dedicated to his election triumphs. Inked on each bicep he has the numbers 365 and 332 - representing the number of electoral votes Obama won on election nights in 2008 and 2012. 'I am an extra set of hands, if he ever needs it,' Mr Love once said of his responsibilities. 'Anything I can do to make life just a little bit easier is, you know, part of my job.' Reggie Love has been recruited to help steer the Tories to victory in May's General Election. The former US college basketball star, 33, served as the president's special assistant and personal aide, commonly referred to as the body man for taking care of the president's needs during Obama's campaign trails. During these times, Mr Love was rarely seen far from the president's side and claimed he filled the role of everything from Obama's 'punchbag' to his 'vending machine' - with the president affectionately referring to him as his 'little brother'. He left his position in the White House in 2011 to complete a masters degree in business administration. Along with another of Obama's former advisers Jim Messina, he has made several trips to London recently and has met with David Cameron. 'Little brother': Reggie Love (left) was the president's ever-present assistant on the campaign trail and in the Oval Office . Mr Love and Jim Messina are not the only Americans to have been recruited for May's General Election. David Axelrod, the former senior adviser to President Obama, has been working as an election strategist for Labour. The veteran politician worked with Mr Love and Mr Messina in the Oval Office during Obama's first term as president. But with 88 days until the election, Ed Miliband is set to lose the American guru for a month when Mr Axelrod embarks on a tour promoting his new book detailing his career in politics. The memoir, titled Believer, is released in the US next week and as a result the Labour adviser will be on the road for most of February. Basketball partners: Mr Love, pictured with Obama in 2009, was dubbed iReggie by the president, and was a constant source of information . Along with Reggie Love, the Tories have recruited Jim Messina to help steer the party to victory in May. The political adviser was the former White House Deputy Chief of Staff for Operations from 2009 to 2011 and served as the campaign manager for Obama's successful 2012 re-election campaign. Meanwhile, one of his former Oval Office colleagues, David Axelrod, is working for Labour. Mr Axelrod, who was also employed in the White House with Reggie Love, was a top political adviser to Bill Clinton and a chief campaign adviser to Obama during the 2008 campaign. In a blow to Ed Miliband, the American political guru is set to disappear for a month just 88 days before the General Election, as he embarks on a tour to promote his new memoir, Believer. Opposing American gurus: The Conservative Party are also being advised by former White House aide Jim Messina (left) while Labour have employed another of Obama's former assistants, David Axelrod (right)","Reggie Love has been recruited to help steer Tories to victory in election .

"These shocking pictures show forest officials in India cremating the body of an endangered Indian leopard after it was killed by villagers. The magnificent beast was tracked down and killed after it was said to have mauled four villagers near Jorhat in north-east Assam Province. All four suffered serious injuries in the attack which happened after the animal entered a local residential settlement. Forest department officials set alight the body of a leopard which was said to have attacked four people in Jorhat, India . The endangered Indian leopard  was killed by locals when it entered a residential colony attacking and injuring seriously four people . Forest department officials later arrived to burn the body of the fully-grown female leopard in line with India's forest policy. The disturbing images show the dead body of the big cat lying among burning logs, its spotted fur singed by the flames. It echoes a similar case on the other side of the country in Ghaziabad last week when a young leopard was hacked to death by villagers after the animal strayed into their farmland. Four were injured when the leopard attacked villagers, who were tracking the animal armed with sticks and stones. More than 1,000 villagers had joined the hunt to find the big cat, a three-year-old female, which was later killed, according to the district forest department. The forest department has lodged a report against 500 unidentified villagers under the Wildlife Protection Act for killing the animal, meaning the police will investigate. The female big cat was cremated as part of India's new forest policy after it was killed by villagers . Villagers tracked down and killed the animal before forest officials set it on fire among a pile of logs . Indian officials have also tried setting traps to catch leopards before they enter human settlements . Smoke rises from the fire as the leopard is burned by officials outside a village near Jorhat, north-east India . And just last month, another leopard was shot dead after it escaped from a compound in Assam and took shelter in a house Jakhalabandha, in the Nagaon district. Indian leopards are under threat of extinction due to poaching for their skin. Villagers also regularly kill the cats when they stray near settlements. Leopard populations are often found quite close to settlements and even in semi-developed areas in India as their forest habitat disappears. In 2008 alone, there were five reported cases of leopards being beaten up or burnt by villagers. Under the Indian Wildlife Protection Act (IWPA), hunting or attacking leopards is illegal as it is an endangered species. The offence carries a sentence of up to three years of imprisonment or a fine of 10,000 rupees (£106). The forest department has also been trying to set up traps so the leopards can be stopped from entering human settlements.","These shocking pictures show forest officials cremating the body of a leopard .

"Brian Williams may be in hot water again over a story he shared years ago about his work as a volunteer firefighter. Williams said in a 2011 interview that while he was a teenager, he ran into a burning home and while conducting a search, came across some thing 'warm and squishy.' When he got outside he realized he had saved a puppy. A few years earlier though, in an interview with Esquire, there were two puppies. Scroll down for videos . Brian Williams (above) told two different versions of a story about saving a puppy from a house fire in interviews . This comes as Williams (pictured in Iraq in 2003 with Command Sgt. Major Tim Terpack) had to apologize over claims he was on a helicopter that took enemy fire in Iraq . 'I remember one such house fire — the structure was fully involved with flames and smoke. I was wearing a breathing apparatus, conducting a search on my hands and knees, when I felt something warm, squishy and furry on the floor of a closet,' Williams told USA Today in 2011. 'I instinctively tucked it in my coat. When I got outside, I saw two small eyes staring up at me, and I returned the 3-week-old (and very scared) puppy to its grateful owners.' In a July 2005 interview with Esquire however,  the embattled news anchor said; 'All I ever did as a volunteer fireman was once save two puppies.' This as Williams recently confessed that he 'made a mistake recalling' a flight he took on a Chinook helicopter over Iraq in 2003. Williams had said in a new segment that the aircraft he was on was hit by a rocket-propelled grenade that miraculously didn't explode, and that he and those aboard managed to land with no loss of life. That story too seemed to change too as it was being recounted by Williams though, as during an appearance on The Late Show with David Letterman he said; 'Two of our four helicopters were hit by ground fire, including the one I was in, RPG and AK-47.' The whole thing went down in flames though when two men who were on the chopper called out Williams on his version of events, saying they never took any enemy fire. Williams is now also being questioned over claims he made in the wake of Hurricane Katrina (above) NBC has now launched a probe, and more of William's stories are now being questioned, including one in which he claimed to see a body floating down the street in the French Quarter of New Orleans in the wake of Hurricane Katrina, right past the Ritz-Carlton hotel where he was staying. The lack of flooding in that area makes this sighting seem unlikely to some. He also claimed during the trip to be one of the few people to come down with dysentery, something that was not prevalent in the flood waters at that time, and that he witnessed a suicide. And NBC is not the only network looking into Williams, as reports have emerged that ABC is now doing the same in hopes of finding other possible false claims made by the newsman. It is being reported that Tom Brokaw (left) thinks Williams (right) should be fired . 'This has been a difficult few days for all of us at NBC News,' NBC News President Deborah Turness said in a staff memo circulated Friday. 'Yesterday, Brian and I spoke to the Nightly News team. And this morning at the Editorial Exchange, we both addressed the wider group. Brian apologized once again, and specifically expressed how sorry he is for the impact this has had on all of you and on this proud organization. 'As you would expect, we have a team dedicated to gathering the facts to help us make sense of all that has transpired. We're working on what the best next steps are – and when we have something to communicate we will of course share it with you.' Should Williams decide to step down, or be let go, there is one person who has already made it clear she would love to fill his role - Katie Couric. There have also been reports that former NBC Nightly News anchor Tom Brokaw believes Williams should be fire.","Brian Williams said in a 2011 interview that as a volunteer firefighter he once saved a puppy from a house engulfed in flames .

"Prominent lawyer Amal Clooney has requested a meeting with Egypt's president to push for the release of Al-Jazeera reporter Mohamed Fahmy, a letter obtained by AFP on Saturday shows. Clooney, who married Hollywood star George Clooney last year, has thrown her legal clout and celebrity behind Fahmy to secure his release. An Egyptian government official had said that Fahmy, a Canadian citizen, would be freed soon after his Australian colleague Peter Greste was deported on February 1.

Plans to meet: Egypt Abdel Fattah Al Sisi, speaking at the 69th United Nations General Assembly at United Nations Headquarters last year, may be visited by Amal Cloomey in the coming weeks . 'Since Mr Greste's release, Mr Fahmy's Egyptian counsel has been informed by Egyptian government officials that his release was to follow, and that it was imminent,' Clooney wrote in the letter addressed to President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi and his foreign minister. 'This was to be expected, given that Mr Fahmy has been the victim of the same injustice as Mr Greste,' wrote the Britain-based lawyer who has represented WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange and taken on other high profile cases. 'Since this has not yet occurred, however, I now write to request a meeting with you, or your designated officials, as soon as possible to discuss the status of the case' she wrote. Fahmy and Greste, along with Egyptian producer Baher Mohamed, were arrested and sentenced to up to 10 years in prison after being convicted of aiding the blacklisted Muslim Brotherhood in their coverage, a charge rights groups called absurd. The court sentenced them to up to 10 years in prison. An appeals court overturned the verdict and ordered a retrial. Fahmy had to drop his Egyptian nationality in order to be eligible for release under a Sisi decree that allows the deportation of foreign prisoners. Let him out: Al-Jazeera news channel's Egyptian-Canadian Mohamed Fahmy gestures as he listens to the verdict inside the defendants cage during his trial for allegedly supporting the Muslim Brotherhood . The former CNN reporter had only recently begun work for the Qatar-owned Al-Jazeera English service when secret police arrested him and his colleagues in December 2013. Their arrests came against the backdrop of a cold war between Egypt and Qatar, which supported the Islamist movement of president Mohamed Morsi, whom Sisi deposed in July 2013. Clooney repeated in her letter that Fahmy's detention was ""illegal"" and wrote she would visit Cairo to push for his release. 'Despite clear assurances that he would be released, Mr Fahmy remains in detention in Egypt,' she wrote. 'I therefore plan to visit Cairo in the near future to meet with Mr Fahmy and to discuss the prospects for his release.'

"The Michigan-based parents of two young daughters  are facing a double tragedy after both being diagnosed with cancer in the last year, it has emerged. Shelby Offrink, 31, and her 34-year-old husband, Ben, had just welcomed their second child, Hazel, now one, into the world prematurely when Mrs Offrink was given devastating news. The new mother was diagnosed with Stage IV glioblastoma, a rare and incurable form of cancer on her spine. She was  forced to undergo months of intense radiation and chemotherapy.

"The first pictures of the gipsy camp where an abducted four-year-old girl was rescued in Greece emerged yesterday as the international appeal to identify the child continued. The discovery of the blonde, blue-eyed girl, who police believe may be from northern or eastern Europe, gives hope that Madeleine McCann may also be found alive. Last night, the girl – known only as Maria – was safely playing with other children at a house run by Greek charity The Smile Of The Child, which is caring for her. Scroll down for video . Discovery: The house at the Roma camp in Farsala, central Greece, where the four-year-old blonde girl was found this week during a raid by police . Squalid: The  Roma camp where police claim they have found 10 children who could be victims of child trafficking . Rubbish-strewn: The camp in Greece where Maria was found. Police have launched an international appeal to discover her identity . Missing and found: Madeleine McCann vanished on May 3, 2007 from a holiday apartment in Praia da Luz, Portugal while police are appealing for help identifying this blonde girl, known only as Maria, who was found on a gypsy camp in Greece after she was allegedly abducted . Who is she? The four-year-old sparked one of the officer's curiosity as she is pale skinned and bore no resemblance to the other children or the couple who claimed to be her parents . The authorities are sure she does not . belong to the adults she was living with, and her nationality and the . circumstances under which she left her real family remain a mystery. Maria . was found last Wednesday in a Roma settlement in Farsala, central . Greece, after a police officer became suspicious because her pale . complexion and blonde hair stood out during a routine raid on illegal . activities. DNA tests . proved she was not related to the couple with whom she was living. A . 39-year-old man and a woman, 40, have been charged with abducting a . minor. Police have requested assistance from Interpol. Photographs of the girl suggest her hair may have been dyed when she was younger as the bottom half of her plaits are brown. Maria . only speaks Roma but appears to understand Greek and is also being . communicated with using sign language, according to staff at The Smile . Of The Child. One employee . told The Mail on Sunday: ‘The little girl was terrified when she first . came to us and didn’t talk at all, but she is now calm and has been . playing with the other kids.’ Playground: Roma children having fun inside the camp at the camp with corrugated iron for a roof on many of the buildings . Local resident: A man with a double pushchair at the Roma camp in Farsala where the child was discovered . Gypsy camp: A Roma resident at the site which police believe may be the centre of a child trafficking ring . Camp site: Clothes are hang out on the fence to dry at the camp which was raided by police looking for drugs and weapons . Distress: Dirty and grimacing as her photo is taken, the little girl is now the centre of an international appeal. Authorities hope her parents can be found so the family can be reunited . Panayiotis . Pardalis, a spokesman for the charity, said: ‘It was obvious that she . was not a Roma girl. She was afraid and under some psychological . pressure when she arrived. ‘She was living under bad conditions and was very dirty, but is now safe.’ Charity . director Costas Giannopoulos said the child was undergoing medical . examinations. The youngster was discovered by authorities living in a Roma gypsy camp in Farsala in central Greece . Aerial view: Farsala, in central eastern Greece, is one of its largest towns in the region a mainly agricultural area . Do you know her? The poster issued by the Greek police requesting help identifying the girl . Ben Needham disappeared on the holiday isle of Kos in 1999 aged just 21 months, sparking a huge but ultimately unsuccessful police hunt. He was seized within moments of him going to play outside a farmhouse, which his grandfather was renovating in the village of Iraklise. His mother was working as a waitress on the island at the time. Investigators suspect the blonde-haired child was abducted by a gypsy gang, and sold to the highest bidder for adoption. But a bungled police inquiry – which was heavily criticised by Ben’s family - failed to track down the culprits. Despite a number of possible sightings and a range of theories about what happened to him, no trace of the youngster has ever been found. ‘We are shocked by how easy it is for people to register . children as their own,’ he told Greek television. Police believe up to ten more children found at the camp may be the victims of a trafficking ring. Delphine . Moralis, secretary general of Missing Children Europe, said: ‘This case . is very unusual in that we’re looking for the child’s family, rather . than the child.’ She said . The Smile Of The Child, a member organisation of Missing Children . Europe, have several houses in Greece where they take children ‘who have . nowhere else to go’. Maria’s . discovery gives fresh hope for other British families with missing . children, including the tragic case of Ben Needham, the Sheffield boy . who went missing in Kos in 1991, aged 21 months. Ben’s sister, . Leighanna, said the discovery was ‘very significant to Ben’s case’. ‘It . gives us great hope that one day this will be Ben. Child trafficking . and illegal adoption in Greece has been pretty high and that’s exactly . what they thought had happened to Ben – that he was taken for a . childless family and passed through gipsy camps,’ she told the BBC. Maria . was found just days after the Metropolitan Police revealed the results . of a major review of the investigation into the disappearance of . Madeleine McCann. Comparison: The case bears a disturbing similarity to theories about the disappearance of British toddler Madeleine McCann, who went missing on a family holiday in Portugal on May 3, 2007 . Breakthrough? Madeleine's parents Kate and Gerry McCann (pictured on a BBC Crimewatch appeal) said they are 'genuinely hopefully' that police can make progress in the investigation . Roma gangs have been accused of trafficking hundreds of children to and from countries including Britain to mug and steal as part of an ‘international criminal network’. Boys and girls as young as 10 are being used to make more than £2000 a month each, through crimes organised by Fagin-like bosses. Around 200 children are though to be involved, with much of their tax free income being smuggled back to Romania to buy property. Details of the sinister 'family' network emerged during an appeal last year in Paris against a five-year-prison sentence by Remus Stoian, a 40-year-old Romanian national. He was found guilty alongside Palos Constantine, a compatriot also aged 40, of organising an ‘international criminal network which aimed to bring minors to France to commit theft.’ Both men were based with their ‘extended clan’ at an illegal Roma campsite in the St Denis suburb of Paris, and regularly 'trafficked' children between ‘France, Romania and even England’, a judicial source told Le Figaro. The Tribunal de Grande Instance in Paris said Stoian and Constantine had been wire tapped as they discussed the successes of their operation, which is still being run by relatives. The conversations reveals that children were ‘selected by hand’, with Stoain saying at one point: ‘You need four to five people who can work for you, and each can bring in between 100 and 150 euros a  day. You can bring in 3000 euros a month.' The young criminal gangs are taken to top tourists spots, including central London to steal from people. The reason for keeping the children moving between different countries is so that they can not be 'traced' to the adults exploiting them. Another Romanian in the gang said he had 11 children working for him personally, with a 'clan chief' ultimately being responsible for the whole operation.","McCann spokesman says missing children 'can still be out there waiting to be found'

"Michael Le Vell, pictured with girlfriend Louise Gibbons, shocked Coronation Street co-stars by admitting he likes watching porn, it was claimed . Coronation Street star Michael Le Vell shocked fellow cast members by openly confessing that he watches porn, it was reported today. The actor, 50, was on set when he revealed that he is a fan of porn website RedTube, it has been claimed. Le Vell, who plays mechanic Kevin Webster, is said to have brought up the topic during a gap in filming, telling co-stars that the X-rated site is one of his 'favourites'. The actor - who has been dating girlfriend Louise Gibbons, 38, for a year - reportedly dismissed comments from surprised colleagues, saying: 'Oh God! I've been single for a long time you know.' A female co-worker is said to have replied: 'But you're not single now!' Le Vell responded: 'I know - but you still have the odd look at RedTube. I delete my search history.' The 'confession' was revealed to The Sun by an insider, who said: 'Everyone was so shocked that Michael was so open about his porn habits. There were lots of people around who heard him. 'It was a light-hearted conversation, and he clearly thought it was funny. 'But there were some people who felt his comments were a bit inappropriate.' The explicit website, which contains thousands of pornographic videos, says it offers 'hot sex straight to your browser window'. Le Vell returned to Coronation Street last July after being found not guilty of a number of alleged sex offences. Before returning to the ITV show, the star also underwent rehab and is now teetotal.

"Brian Williams has announced he is temporarily stepping down as anchor of the NBC Nightly News. The 55-year-old Managing Editor of the United States' most watched network news program said in a statement Saturday he has become 'too much a part of the news'. He  added: 'I have decided to take myself off of my daily broadcast for the next several days, and Lester Holt has kindly agreed to sit in for me to allow us to adequately deal with this issue. 'Upon my return, I will continue my career-long effort to be worthy of the trust of those who place their trust in us.' A source told the DailyMail.com Williams will not be involved in any of the day-to-day editing of the program during his absence. The scandal unfolded after the broadcaster admitted his personal account of an RPG attack on his helicopter in Iraq was false. Holt, who hosted the weekend edition of the Nightly News on Saturday, mentioned the news about his colleague and read out a statement. However he did not elaborate and didn't mention the fact he will be taking over. Scroll down for video . Brian Williams has announced he is temporarily stepping down from his job as anchor at NBC Nightly News . Williams has also been accused of fabricating elements of his time in New Orleans in the wake of Hurricane Katrina. While reporting on the ground he said he saw a body floating down the street, and caught dysentery from flood water. As a result of the controversy, the veteran journalist is at risk from rivals who want his job, according to the New York Daily News. Former NBC presenter, and current Yahoo! News personality Katie Couric, had been linked with the role, but a spokesman ruled her out on Saturday. Williams confessed that he 'made a mistake recalling' a flight he took on a Chinook helicopter over Iraq in 2003. 'Made a mistake recalling': Williams, shown left in Iraq and right in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, has found his claims met with scrutiny . In the midst of a career spent covering and consuming news, it has become painfully apparent to me that I am presently too much a part of the news, due to my actions.' As Managing Editor of NBC Nightly News, I have decided to take myself off of my daily broadcast for the next several days, and Lester Holt has kindly agreed to sit in for me to allow us to adequately deal with this issue. Upon my return, I will continue my career-long effort to be worthy of the trust of those who place their trust in us. He has previously said the aircraft he was on was hit by a rocket-propelled grenade that miraculously didn't explode, and managed to land with no loss of life. In the most extreme version of the tale, told to David Letterman in March 2013, he said: 'Two of our four helicopters were hit by ground fire, including the one I was in, RPG and AK-47.' In fact, he was on a different aircraft entirely, which by some accounts was as much as an hour behind the one helicopter which was actually hit. He recanted his account after being called out by veterans who really were on the chopper. NBC has launched an official probe into Williams, lead by Richard Esposito, its top investigative journalist. Since the apology, questions were also raised about statements Williams made on coverage of Hurricane Katrina, which was one of his proudest moments at NBC. He claimed to see a body floating down the street in the French Quarter of New Orleans, past the Ritz-Carlton hotel where he was staying. Sore spot: Williams's Friday broadcast opened with an exclusive story from Iraq - the country from which Williams's much-maligned error stemmed . In a 2006 interview he referenced the moment: 'When you look out of your hotel room window in the French Quarter and watch a man float by face down, when you see bodies that you last saw in Banda Aceh, Indonesia, and swore to yourself that you would never see in your country'. Some are sceptical of the story, as the French Quarter was not extensively flooded in the disaster, bringing into question whether there would have been enough water for a body to float down the street. He has also claimed that flood water gave him dysentery, which medics have said was not prevalent during Katrina. Nonetheless, Williams's top two items tonight were on the very subjects under most scrutiny. He led the broadcast with a story from the struggle with ISIS in Iraq, then moved on to the impact of extreme weather in America, included flooding in California. As well as the internal probe, the Daily News also reported that 'a secret task-force' from the rival ABC network is also dredging up old footage of Williams in the hope of finding more claims which do not withstand scrutiny. According to the newspaper, Ben Sherwood, the president of Disney-ABC Television Group, ordered the task-force himself - but the network has strongly denied such a group exists. The News also outlined another threat allegedly closing in on Williams - his former NBC colleague Katie Couric, now a big-name anchor at Yahoo! Global News. A source told the paper: 'Katie still has deep, deep contacts at NBC. She would love to return as the Nightly News anchor... She wants to be back in the big leagues again.' Others denied she had designs on the NBC top spot. Replacement: Lester Holt anchors the weekend editions of NBC's Today show and Dateline . Lester Holt anchors the weekend editions of NBC's Today show and Dateline. The 55-year-old also hosts the weekend edition of the Nightly News. He has already spent time in the role he is taking over - having covered for Williams when he was having knee replacement surgery in August 2013. Holt's first job was as a DJ for a Country and Western station during college. Hoping for a career in the entertainment industry, he soon discovered he could only get a full-time job if he reported the news. The broadcaster spent 19 years with CBS beginning in 1981, when he was hired as a reporter for WCBS-TV in New York City. In August 2005, he assumed full-time duties at NBC News, where he became a substitute anchor for NBC Nightly News and Today. He then became a full-time co-anchor of Weekend Today following the death of his predecessor David Bloom. In September 2012 he faced embarrassment after turning up late to a Saturday morning show, because he overslept. Holt took to Twitter to alert viewers of his frazzled morning. 'For the first time in 9 yrs of hosting weekend @todayshow I overslept!' he posted on his Twitter account. The executive producer for the show ended up giving Holt a wake-up call at 5:45 a.m and he made a mad dash from his apartment, in the Flatiron District in New York City, to 30 Rock in midtown Manhattan where the show goes live at 7:00 a.m. He took the lead role during NBC's coverage of the London Olympics in 2012. And sleep also proved to be scarce for him during his stint across the pond. He was enjoying a nap on a train ride from London to Alnmouth, in the north of England, when he overslept, missed his stop and ended up in Scotland on August 7. He had to change trains four times over a time span of nine hours to get back where he needed to be. But in his typical good humor, the newsman joked about the incident and shared it with his fans over Twitter. 'If ya gotta end up in the wrong place u can do worse than Edinburgh. Catching some quick sights,' he tweeted, adding that on his return trip he would be 'drinking LOTS of coffee.' During the coverage of the Sochi Winter Oylimpics in 2014, he downed a shot of vodka with co-host Natalie Morales.

"The convicted killer who was the subject of a popular podcast has been granted an appeal. Adnan Syed and his role in the murder of ex-girlfriend Hae Min Lee, who was killed on January 13, 1999, became a topic of discussion among millions of Americans when Serial, a podcast that reexamined evidence in the case in hopes of determining his guilt or innocence, premiered last year. Now, thanks to the work of the team behind Serial, most notably narrator Sarah Koenig, an appeal has been granted thanks to a woman contacted by producers who said she could provide an alibi for Sayed. The Maryland Court of Special Appeals after learning of this approved Syed's application for leave to appeal on Friday, which claimed his attorney, Christina Gutierrez, was ineffective . Scroll down for video . Adnan Syed (left) has been granted an appeal after being convicted of the murder of ex-girlfriend Hae Min Lee (right) This is largely thanks to the work of the team behind Serial, most notably narrator Sarah Koenig (above) Asia McClain has stated in a sworn deposition to Syed's attorney, C. Justin Brown, that she saw him in the library at the time prosecutors claim Lee was killed. In the affidavit, published by the last month by The Blaze, McClain stated that she now realized 'her importance to the case' and felt she needed to make her story 'known to the court system.' It was revealed on Serial that McClain had let Syed's attorney during the trial know that she could alibi the high school student, but she was never called to testify during either of his trials or even contacted by the woman. She also wrote Syed in jail letting him now that she saw him in the library that afternoon. This as prosecutors claimed Ms Lee had been dead by 2.36pm, but Ms McClain said she remembered talking with Syed from 2.20 to 2.40pm. Gutierrez also failed to let her client know of a possible plea deal with prosecutors during his trials. Lee was found buried in a shallow grave having been strangled a few weeks after she disappeared, with Syed being identified as the murdered by Jay Wilds, a friend who said he helped Syed dig the grave. Syed has maintained his innocence in her murder for the past 15 years. Prison artwork created by Syed sits near family photos in the home of his mother . 'It's the first step in a pretty long process but we're extremely happy,' Brown told The Baltimore Sun. Syed now needs to file formal briefings of his appeal arguments by March 16, at which time the court could hear oral arguments and offer or deny Syed a new trial. His appeal is scheduled to be heard in June 2015. Syed, 34, who a jury found guilty of first-degree murder, robbery, kidnapping and false imprisonment, is currently serving a life sentence plus 30 years in a state prison in Cumberland.","The Maryland Court of Special Appeals has granted an appeal to Adnan Syed over his conviction in the murder of ex-girlfriend Hae Min Lee .

"The collapse of Rosie O'Donnell's two-year marriage had nothing to do with her quitting the troubled daytime chat show, The View, show insiders have disclosed. In fact, her sudden departure was prompted by rows with producers and other staff, who are said to be delighted she is leaving. O'Donnell is being seen as the key reason for the show's collapsing ratings, which had led to serious concerns over falling advertising revenue. ABC executives now believe they have a chance to save The View, whose future in recent months had increasingly come into question. Scroll down for video . Rosie O'Donnell's sudden departure was from The View prompted by rows with producers and other staff, who are said to be delighted she is leaving . The collapse of Rosie O'Donnell's two-year marriage to Michelle Rounds (above) had nothing to do with her quitting the troubled daytime chat show . But they will do so by radically changing how the show works behind the scenes after O'Donnell's tempestuous relationship with other staff. 'The View is a pain in my ass,' a senior Disney executive said. 'We need to instill law and order with the talent on that show to fix it.' ABC insiders now acknowledge it was a disastrous error to bring O'Donnell back to the show. They say that far from her suggestion that her marriage had become troubled recently, it was already on the rocks when she was signed for The View. And they said that by putting her departure down to problems in her private life O'Donnell was using it as an exit strategy when the real issue was that she was failing as a host. 'Put simply Rosie wanted out and she believed this story was the easiest way for her to exit,' a show source said. Disney and ABC executives believe that they will now have control directly over the show after a troubled relationship with O'Donnell. 'When Barbara Walters ran the show she was able to keep all of the women in line,' a source said. 'ABC can now go back to how it was and have their executives in charge instead of the talent calling the shots - Rosie caused nothing but trouble.' Among the most difficult issues with her conduct was that on Twitter she would retweet passive-aggressively fans who criticized the show. A rep for the show called these accusations 'completely ridiculous' and then added, 'all our thoughts are with Rosie and her family.' They also added that The View is outperforming rival program The Talk in all key metrics this season - Total Viewers, Women 25-54 and Women 18-49. O'Donnell would retweet passive-aggressively fans who criticized the show, like the woman above . This all comes just one week after co-host Rosie Perez returned to The View on Monday . O'Donnell confirmed on Friday that she will not return to the daytime talk show, as she focuses on her family in the wake of the break-up. The 52-year-old married Rounds in June 2012 and the couple adopted a baby daughter named Dakota the following year. The two split in November, though remain close it seems, with O'Donnell posting a photo of Rounds on her Instagram account on Christmas Eve. O'Donnell also has daughters Chelsea and Vivienne and son Blake from her first marriage to Kelli Carpenter, and son Parker who she adopted in 1995. O'Donnell announced in 2009 that Carpenter had moved out two years earlier, and she started dating Rounds in the summer of 2011. ABC said in a statement regarding the star's departure from The View: 'Rosie is an immensely talented star who comes in each and every morning brimming with ideas, excitement and passion for the show. 'When she told us she wanted to exit The View, we respected and understood her desire to put her well-being and her family first. 'We’re delighted she’s still part of the ABC family with upcoming guest appearances on The Fosters, and we know she’ll return to The View often with her unique point of view and updates on her work and her family.' Despite her split from wife Michelle Rounds, O'Donnell posted this photo of her and their daughter over Christmas Eve . Rosie O'Donnell poses with her children in this photo from July 2014 . O'Donnell made her debut on the show in September 2006 as moderator, replacing Meredith Vieira. However a few months later, after failing to reach an agreement on a new contract, it was announced the star would be leaving later that year. O'Donnell in fact cut her contract short and left in May 2007 after an on-air argument with Elizabeth Hasselbeck, but later stated it was because she 'did not gel' with the executive producer. She returned to The View - now moderated by Whoopi Goldberg - in the autumn of 2014, after the axing of Jenny McCarthy and Sherri Sheppard and the departure of Barbara Walters. O'Donnell and Rounds faced difficult times during their relationship, with the star announcing in August 2012 that her wife had been diagnosed with desmoid tumours. O'Donnell suffered a heart attack that same month.","The collapse of Rosie O'Donnell's two-year marriage had nothing to do with her quitting the troubled daytime chat show The View, sources say .

"This is the moment an armed robber burst into a North Tyneside store with a handgun, stole the store's money then apologised to the shopkeeper before running off. Police now are hunting the masked raider after the attack, which happened just before 7am yesterday at Diane's Newsagency, in Angle Terrace, Wallsend. The 46-year-old member of staff, Jeanette Greenwell, from Wallsend, was shocked but otherwise uninjured. Scroll down for video . The masked gunman captured on CCTV as he brandishes his gun and points it at shopkeeper Jeanette Greenwell . She said the attacker cocked his gun - but before he ran off, he apologised to her. Mrs Greenwell, who a mother to Danielle, 23, Jamie, 22, and Shane, 15, said: 'I had my head down sorting out paperwork and I heard a customer come in because the chime on the door sounded. 'The next thing I knew when I looked up a man in a balaclava had a gun pointing at me in my face. At first I thought it was a wind up. 'He wanted the money in the till so I handed it over to him. I think he roughly only got away with around £80 because I had only been open an hour, I told him it was all I had in the till. 'I wondered at first whether it was a real gun but when I saw him pull it back, I panicked and started frantically searching in the till.' 'The strange thing was, he said ""sorry"" to me then ran off. It makes me think that he must have known me because why would you rob someone and then say sorry for it? 'It doesn't make any sense.' The robber demands all the money in the shop till, which Mrs Greenwell later said totalled about £80 . After taking all the cash, the robber then inexplicably says 'sorry' to Mrs Greenwell . The CCTV footage then shows him fleeing the store, with all the shop's takings stored in a plastic bag . Northumbria Police said money was handed over and the man left the shop with the cash in a small plastic bag. The suspect was tall and had a slim build. He was wearing a black balaclava over his face, a yellow hoodie with the hood up, blue jeans and dark footwear. Stills from the CCTV showed the robber to be armed with what appeared to be a gun before he made off with the cash, passing two customers on the way out. Mrs Greenwell, who is married to Paul, a 44-year-old taxi driver, said: 'One of the customers tried to follow the robber in his car while the other looked after me while I dialled 999. 'It's a really close knit community around here and the owners, Bob and Diane, say they have never had something like this happen in the 30 years that they have run the store. 'You usually know everyone who comes in the shop. The shock hasn't sunk in yet, I'm still waiting for it to hit me but I'll still be returning to work, I've got a mortgage to pay.

Police are now appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to contact them as soon as possible. Police Chief Inspector Steve Readdie, of North Tyneside Area Command, said: 'We have extra officers on patrol in the area to reassure residents and answer any concerns people may have.' Anyone with information should contact police on 101, extension 69191, quoting log number 166 of 06/02/15 or ring the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.","Masked robber was caught on CCTV charging into store brandishing a gun .

"The man whose office romp with a junior went viral this week is a senior insurance broker in his late 40s, Daily Mail Australia can reveal. The man involved in the Christchurch office sex romp with a woman almost half his age is a regional manager at Marsh Ltd insurance firm, and is married with a 15-year-old son and 19-year-old daughter. He had a steamy encounter with a company secretary in her 20s  in the Marsh Ltd office at Papanui Road, while patrons from the Carlton Bar across the street cheered them on after unexpectedly getting front-row seats for the action. Scroll down for video . The man at the centre of the New Zealand office sex romp which went viral has been revealed as a husband and father of two aged in his late 40s . Video footage and photographs by the revellers caused an online phenomenon that was watched by millions worldwide. Unfortunately one of the people who saw the frolics on social media was the man’s wife who reportedly found out about the devastating affair on Facebook. A friend of the man’s brother, who is a glazer in the city, said that when the brother heard about the office romp he texted him about it, not knowing that he was the one actually involved. ‘When he heard what happened he never thought that it was him. He actually texted him straightaway to find out who in the office it was,’ the friend said. ‘After he didn’t reply he even asked, ‘It’s not you is it?’ He was pretty shocked when he admitted that it was.’ When the Daily Mail Australia called at the regional manager’s house in the affluent Christchurch suburb of Sumner to speak with him on Saturday, the man refused to open his door or answer any questions. The couple's office sex scandal which took place last Friday night went viral after patrons at the pub across the road captured the intimate moment . It took place in this office (inside the window on the right) and neither party has returned to work since the incident . The man's wife only found out about the affair when it went viral on Facebook, and is said to be devastated by the revelations . ‘Get off these premises, get off these premises,’ was all he said from behind his front door. He then refused to reply to questions at all. The man appeared to be home alone despite it being the Waitangi Day weekend bank holiday. However, when the Daily Mail Australia visited the premises the day before it was his wife that answered the door. She said that her husband was not at home and would not comment on the incident. ‘I’ve got nothing to say. He’s not here,’ she said. The wife's friends were supporting her, a neighbour said. It’s clear the marriage has an uncertain future. A neighbour that lived a few houses away and who claimed he'd known the family for years, was shocked at what had happened and had 'no explanation' for the senior manager's behaviour. Patrons at the Carlton Bar and Eatery captured the scandalous behaviour last Friday evening . There are reports the senior broker has been sacked over the incident, but the firm claims the internal investigation is still ongoing . The man, aged in his 40s, would not answer questions and appeared to be home alone this weekend . ‘It’s all come as a bit of a shock. I still can’t believe it has happened. I’ve no explanation for it at all,’ the neighbour said. ‘It’s very, very sad. He’s a lovely guy. I’ve no idea why he would do it. He and his wife have been very good to me over the years and are a lovely couple.’ Earlier this week the ex-fiancé of the woman involved in the sex romp said their engagement was already over before the incident, and that it's sad 'for everyone involved'. Identifying himself only as ‘Josh’ he told The Edge radio station on Friday morning that they were no longer engaged and had split up weeks before the erotic encounter. He said he knew the other man who appeared in the video, but had never met him. ‘I think for everyone involved it's quite sad,’ he said. An insurance industry insider said that the man had been sacked from his job over the incident. But the firm has only confirmed that an internal investigation is still ongoing. The  secretary's ex-fiance spoke a few days ago, saying they had split a few weeks prior .","Man involved in Christchurch office romp has been revealed as a father .

"Call to action: David Cameron is being urged to help thousands of badly wounded British veterans . David Cameron is being urged to help thousands of badly wounded British veterans who are being forced to use their war pensions to pay for social care. Under the rules, veterans injured on or before April 5, 2005, must hand over most of their weekly injury compensation payments should they require social care. By contrast, service personnel wounded after that date are entitled to keep all their payments because they are paid out of a different Government scheme. Now the Royal British Legion, backed by many MPs, is calling on the Prime Minister to correct this anomaly, which penalises veterans of the Second World War, the Falklands War, Northern Ireland and both Gulf Wars. Last night, Sir Bob Russell MP, a member of the Commons’ Defence Select Committee, said: ‘It’s an absurdity that some veterans should be discriminated against in this way. So I will be asking the Prime Minister for an explanation as to who drew up this dividing line and on what basis this date was chosen.’ Veterans injured in service on or before April 5, 2005, receive a War Disablement Pension and are known as War Pensioners. Those who have social care needs routinely find councils take all but £10 per week of their compensation to cover their care costs. This is despite the fact that a veteran with a similar injury who was wounded after the cut-off date is able to keep all of their compensation. This is because councils are instructed to fully exempt payments made under the Armed Forces Compensation Scheme (AFCS) from any means testing for social care. Former submariner Keith Clarke, 43, a paraplegic, is forced to give £100 per week to meet the costs of his social care, which includes daily visits by a care worker. Dedicated: The rule penalises veterans of the Second World War, the Falklands War, Northern Ireland and both Golf Wars. Above, ranks of the RBL march past during the National Remembrance Service in London . Normandy veteran Fred Cannon, 90, who suffered gunshot wounds in 1944, apparently has ‘very little money left over’ after his council has taken his pension to pay for nursing home fees. Since 2005, some 16,000 injured troops have been paid almost £341 million in compensation from the AFCS scheme. A Royal British Legion spokesman said: ‘Military compensation is awarded as a recompense for pain, suffering and loss of amenity experienced by injured service personnel and veterans. ‘It should not be treated as normal income. The system is unfair and has to change.’","Some veterans must hand over most of weekly pension if they require care .

"The victims of paedophile priests who sexually assaulted them as young boys in a Catholic seminary have spoken out against their abusers forty years after leaving the religious Order. The men, most of whom are now in their sixties, were given sums of money by Comboni Missionaries - formerly known as the Verona Fathers - in October last year following a lengthy civil court case. While two of their  abusers are dead, another alleged assailant is still alive and living out his final days in the Order's Mother House in Verona. Gerry McLaughlin (pictured front centre, with his arms folded) was just 11 when he went to Mirfrield Junior Seminary where he was abused by Fr John Pinkman (right) West Yorkshire Police have implored him to return to the UK for questioning but Italian authorities have deemed him unfit to travel. Despite compensating each of the men, Comboni Missionaries did not accept last month that all had been abused and rejected the claim that sexual assault was embedded in its culture. Now, 40 years after leaving Mirfield Junior Seminary in Yorkshire, the men have waived their right to anonymity to tell of the depraved abuse they fell victim to. Gerry McLaughlin, who now lives in Ireland, was taken to Mirfield in 1964 at the age of 11. 'I'd just turned 11 in June. A priest came round the school and gave a talk, there may have been slides,' he told MailOnline. 'It sounded great, they spoke of the missions in Africa and of all the animals there. 'They asked who wanted to go and I was the only one who went from my class.' Shortly after arriving at the house, the man, now 61, said he felt uneasy. 'I was a bit surprised on the first day when the parents were told to leave by 7pm. 'Later, I said to one of the guys ""look let's take a stroll down there"" and he said ""You can't, you're not allowed to go out."" 'In terms of the sexual abuse, I didn't know that that's what it was, I just knew I didn't like it.' Mr McLaughlin says he was routinely abused by Father John Pinkman, the cleric in charge of the youngest boys in the seminary. Mark Murray aged 13 at the house in Mirfield, Yorkshire, in March 1969 . Two years after arriving there, the then 13-year-old left for a different life. Other boys were subjected to depravity when being treated for illness  by Mirfield's Infirmian, Father Domenico Valmaggia. Brian Hennessy recalls routine abuse when being treated for pain in his kidneys. 'I ended up in hospital for a couple of weeks undergoing tests,' he said. 'Back at Mirfield, Father  Valmaggia had a remedy for this condition. 'He confined me to the infirmary and supplied me with large bottles of lemonade each day to wash out the system,' he said. 'Locking the door behind him he would tell me to take off my pyjamas and kneel on the edge of the bed.' Father John Pinkman died in South Africa in 1984 of a heart attack. Father Valmaggia, in Italy in 2011, with neither of the men ever having to face police questioning. Despite never seeing their abusers face prosecution, the men decided to launch a civil case against Comboni Missionaries in 2012 seeking damages for the abuse they claim to have endured. A settlement was arranged with each of the men, though the Order has yet to acknowledge any abuse took place to the anguish of its alumni. 'It never was the money at all, money was never our priority,' added Mr McLaughlin, who was awarded £8,000. One man, accused of carrying out a deep and disturbing relationship with another of the seminary's former pupils when he was 13, is still alive. The elderly man, who MailOnline has chosen not to name, is said to be too ill to face extradition for police questioning. His alleged victim, Mark Murray, said the abuse was so shrouded in religious context he came to believe he was living closer to God by submitting himself. 'He began kissing me and told me about the breath of life. 'The abuse was progressive and relied heavily on religion to justify what he was doing to me.' Mr Murray contacted the Order House in Italy with his claims, but was told the priest, now a frail man in his eighties, was not of sound enough mind or body to either face extradition or carry out official duties. While it has never publicly acknowledged that any abuse was carried out, the Order added that the man was being kept out of the reach of children. Mirfield Junior Seminary in Yorkshire where the men say they were subjected to routine sexual abuse as children in the 1960s and 70s . A 2008 photograph of him performing a religious ceremony while standing next to a young girl in Italy however prompted Mr Murray to contact the West Yorkshire Police. Despite their efforts, they say all avenues have been exhausted in moving the investigation along. 'This is a long running and complicated investigation which dates back to alleged offences that were committed in the 1960s,' said Detective Inspector Michael Brown. 'There is an individual who we would like to speak to in connection with these allegations. This person left the UK for Italy at the time of the alleged offences and has not returned since then. 'In Spring 2013, new evidence came to light and we reopened the case with the hope of bringing someone to justice. 'We have conducted a thorough investigation and have been in close liaison with the authorities in Italy and the Catholic Church but, unfortunately we need to interview the suspect in this case and he is unable to travel from Italy voluntarily due to ill health. 'All legal avenues have been pursued to enforce his return to UK but his ill health means we are unable to go through the formal procedures to extradite him. 'The investigation is not closed but has reached a point where we can't go any further.' When contacted by MailOnline, the Comboni Missionaries said it was 'dismayed' by allegations of abuse and had cooperated with police enquiries - but would not acknowledge that any of the men had been abused despite damages having been awarded. 'It was with great sadness and regret that the Verona Fathers learned that a number of allegations of historical abuse had been made relating to our former junior seminary, St Peter’s, located in Mirfield, West Yorkshire,' said Fr Martin Devenish, Provincial Superior of the London Province of the Verona Fathers. 'We know that anyone subjected to abusive behaviour will experience suffering and we are dismayed to think that such suffering may have been caused to youngsters who attended our junior seminary. 'If that is the case, we are deeply sorry to anyone who has been hurt in this way and our thoughts and prayers are with them.'","Men at Mirfield Junior Infirmary were sexually abused in the 1960s .

"Valerie Moore, chief executive of the trust which runs the school refused to comment but an online message said the decision was for 'safety' reasons . When snow began to fall gently around their primary school, pupils were naturally excited. But their joy quickly melted away when their teachers banned them from going near it – or even looking at it through the window. The youngsters were kept inside after they were ‘marshalled’ into the building at the start of the day. And a teacher even closed the blinds to stop a class of eight and nine-year-olds from being ‘distracted’ by watching it through the window. The school – where a vicar caused uproar before Christmas by telling pupils that Santa Claus doesn’t exist – claimed it had acted because of health and safety concerns as the ground had become icy. But outraged parents accused staff at Stalham Academy, near Great Yarmouth in Norfolk, of being killjoys after just 1cm of snow fell and said that they had missed an opportunity to teach the enthusiastic children about snow. Mother-of-six Shelly Betts, 43, whose daughter Bethany, eight, is a pupil at the school, said: ‘When they told me they’d shut the blinds I couldn’t believe it. They’re only little and they only stay children for a short time. ‘They could have turned the snow into a science lesson instead of banning them from seeing it. ‘By the time they came out of school it was all gone. I don’t want it to end up with my children only knowing about snow from Christmas cards.’ Julie Hollins, 30, who has an eight-year-old son at the academy, said: ‘Stopping them from seeing it fall is like a slap in the face for little children.’ Another mother, who asked not to be named but whose nine-year-old daughter was in the classroom when the blinds were shut, said: ‘It only snowed for about 40 minutes but the teacher put the blinds down so they couldn’t see it. ‘It was so dark they had to put the lights on. They were stuck in all day as they weren’t allowed to play in the snow – and there was only about 1cm. Hitting the headlines: Stalham School, in Norfolk, has previously been in the news after a visiting reverend told children that Santa Claus isn't real . ‘These are eight-year-olds. It’s not like they’re doing A-levels. I just thought it’s a bit pathetic. Other local schools were doing snowman-building competitions.’ She added: ‘They said there were health and safety reasons because it was icy but it wasn’t. ‘Then they said there were education reasons because the kids were doing a test but none of them remember taking a test.’ She said there had been another light smattering of snow a few days earlier, during which one child was told off for ‘flicking a bit of snow’, while ‘another was put in isolation for touching it’. The mother added: ‘The school has been in freefall since it became an academy last year. ‘Homework is sporadic, teachers are leaving and no one will talk to parents. ‘When my daughter came home and said what had happened it was the last straw.’ The school was put into special measures following an Ofsted inspection in 2013 and was converted into an academy last May. It is now run by Right For Success Academy Trust, which runs two other schools in Norwich. Valerie Moore, the trust’s chief executive, was not available to comment yesterday. A message posted on the school’s Facebook page after the snowfall last Monday said: ‘We acknowledge that snow is an unusual and exciting occurrence for everyone, especially children. ‘The academy’s playgrounds were extremely icy so it was felt that in the interests of safety and in line with our risk assessment under health and safety, that children were brought inside at the start of the day.’ The notice added that the teacher who closed the blinds ‘noted the heavy snowfall was having an impact upon the learning of the children’ and acted to ensure that ‘children focused on the tasks in hand’.","Teachers ordered eight and nine-year-olds inside when it began snowing .

"Business minister Matthew Hancock (pictured) said he was 'shocked' to be having to argue that 'business is a force for good' Businesses will today be promised a £10 billion boost in the Conservative manifesto as the party seeks to exploit Labour's damaging row with captains of industry. Business minister Matthew Hancock said he is 'shocked and dismayed' to be having to argue that 'business is a force for good', a question he said he thought had been 'settled in the last century'. In an interview with the Daily Mail, the Cabinet minister set out plans to cut regulation and red tape, saving firms an average of £2,000 a year. Mr Hancock also signalled the party is preparing to offer tax breaks to start-up companies taking on their first employees and further steps to rein in vexatious industrial tribunal claims. 'Business is a force for good in our society,' he said. 'It's the first time in my adult life that a major political party thinks that being against business is good for Britain. 'We have to support and build our nation's employers. This is where jobs and prosperity come from. Coming from a small business background, it's why I came into politics in the first place, and we've spent five years working hard to make Britain a beacon for enterprise. 'We are increasingly regarded as a good place to start and grow a business and we want to be the best in the world. Labour's idea that you can attack business and businesspeople without damaging people's standard of living and jobs in Britain should have been consigned to the history books in the last century.' Labour has been embroiled in a damaging row with business leaders since turning on the boss of Boots when he expressed alarm at the prospect of the party regaining power. Ed Miliband has launched a series of policies supposed to target what he calls 'predator' capitalists. The party has suggested it will not go ahead with a planned cut in corporation tax for large firms to 21 per cent. Over the last week, more business leaders, including several who previously supported Labour, have come out to raise concern about the party's anti-business rhetoric. Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls, meanwhile, faced embarrassment when he could only name someone called 'Bill' when asked to cite Labour's business backers. The row has left Mr Balls facing a tricky appearance next week at the British Chambers of Commerce, which he is due to address. Mr Hancock said the Conservatives would go into the election as 'unashamedly pro-business and pro-enterprise'. He said the coalition had gradually cut regulation -- consignined 110,000 pages to the dustbin, saving business £2.2 billion this year. But a Conservative-only government would go further, committing to more deregulation -- with the initial focus on agriculture, railways, energy, construction, retail, travel operators and the chemical industry. A review of each sector will take place this year if the Tories remain in power, and Government departments made to implement a 'one in, two out' rule whenever they introduce any new regulation. Mr Hancock said he accepted there was scepticism about red tape 'bonfires', but the coalition had made 'solid' progress. Most striking was a 75 per cent fall in the number of tribunal claims against firms following reforms introduced by the Government to weed out vexatious claims. Employees now have to have been working for their employer for two years before they can take them to a tribunal alleging unfair dismissal, and go through a conciliation process before lodging a claim. Boots chief Stefano Pessina (left) has warned it would be a 'catastrophe' if Labour and Ed Miliband (right) win power. Pessina claimed Miliband’s policies were ‘not helpful for business and not helpful for the country’ Boots, which has 70,000 UK workers, came under fire from senior Labour figures after the attack on its business policies . But the minister said: 'There are areas where we haven't been able to go, because of the Liberal Democrats -- particularly in terms of making it easier to employ people.' Business Secretary Vince Cable has accused the Tories of wanting to make it possible for firms to 'fire at will'. Mr Hancock said: 'It's about making it easier to take on your first employees. We need greater clarity that you can take somebody on and if it goes wrong you won't pay an unduly heavy price. 'There is a lot of bureaucracy around taking people on and we want to make it easier.' Baroness Brady, the Apprentice star who now a Conservative peer and an adviser on small business to the Government, said: 'Red tape hits small businesses harder than anything else. For an entrepreneur working all hours to build their business and provide for themselves and their family it really can mean the difference between success and failure. Former Apprentice star Karen Brady said government rep tape hits small businesses 'harder than anything else' 'Government should do everything it can to celebrate enterprise and back risk takers, but sometimes that means getting out of the way of their success. 'Cutting red tape has been a key part of this Government’s economic plan and has already saved businesses £10 billion, but there’s still much more we can do. Every penny we can save small businesses by scrapping unnecessary regulations means more jobs, more growth and more hardworking people able to make a success of their business.' John Longworth, Director General of the British Chambers of Commerce, said: 'Government regulation all too often places excessive financial and administrative burdens on British businesses. After years of campaigning to cut red tape, it is welcome to see proposals for stretching deregulation targets for the next Parliament — which would help companies concentrate on jobs and exports, rather than on endless compliance measures. 'A stretch target for deregulation would also send a clear message to Whitehall that new rules must be a last resort, rather than a first reflex for mandarins and ministers alike.' Simon Walker, Director General of the Institute of Directors, said: 'The coalition Government has made encouraging progress in reducing the burden of regulation on business, and in particular on small and medium sized businesses. We welcome the ambition shown in the commitment to finding a further £10billion worth of regulatory savings, and urge all political parties to consider how they can make it easier, smoother and more efficient to do business in the UK. The target announced by the Conservatives is admirable, and we’ll work with all parties to make sure deregulation stays at the top of political agenda. 'The next parliament will see continuing pressure of the public finances whoever wins, so we need to unleash business to drive economic growth and generate tax revenues.' Toby Perkins, Labour’s shadow small business minister, said: 'The truth is that ministers have blocked Labour’s plans to back small business by tackling late payment and to deal with unfair and uncompetitive treatment of suppliers. They’ve opposed our plans to cut – then freeze – business rates, and at a time when net lending to small and medium sized businesses has fallen by £1 billion in the last quarter, they’ve opposed our plans for a proper British Investment Bank supported by a regional network. 'Where the Tory-led government has failed to act to support small firms, the next Labour government will.' It is now mandatory for a claimant to contact the Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service (Acas) before they can lodge a claim with an employment tribunal. So far Acas has conciliated in over 37,000 cases, and only 24 per cent progressed to a Tribunal Claim. Increased flexiblity on firms' audit requirements has saved £300 million a year. Plays, live music acts and indoor sports displays no longer need to obtain a licence to perform in schools, nurseries, hospitals, circuses and arts centres, which has saved businesses £1.4 million each year . Paper tax discs have been scrapped, saving firms with company vehicles time and money. A requirement for retailers to notify TV Licensing of the name and address of TV purchasers has been axed, saving them £2.5 million per year. EU rules defining jam as being 'two-thirds sugar' have been ditched, stopping firms such as Clippy's, which have a lower sugar content, having to relabel their products 'fruit spread'.","Businesses will today be promised a £10billion boost by the Conservatives .

"Bill Maher poked fun at the allegations against NBC News anchor Brian Williams last night and joked Williams told such big lies that he's been offered a position to work at Fox News. Maher's show which aired last night on HBO at 10pm shed a little humor on Brian William's heroic tales. 'When we get older… we misplace our keys, we have trouble with people’s names, we can’t remember if the helicopter we were in crashed,' quipped the late night host saying he can sympathize with the mistakes of old age. Williams made such a 'blatant departure from the truth, he got an offer from Fox News,' concluded Maher. Scroll down for video . New employment opportunities: . Former NBC late Night Host Conan O'Brien also made fun of Williams two nights ago saying he's tried to 'get in on someone's glory' more than once. Conan showed manipulated video of Brian Williams saying he was responsible for the Miracle on the Hudson plane landing and climbed a giant rock - like Tom Cruise in 'Mission Impossible 2.' NBC News anchor Brian Williams' 2006 claims that he saw a dead body float past his hotel window during Hurricane Katrina is drawing fresh skepticism in the wake of his own admission on Wednesday that he lied about being aboard a helicopter that was hit by enemy fire during the Iraq war. Despite a swift apology on his Nightly News program, Williams is at the center of a media firestorm after it emerged that his old war story that he has retold numerous times over the past 12 years has become increasingly exaggerated. Williams was forced to apologize this week after claiming in a report on Friday that the chinook he was aboard in Iraq had been hit by enemy fire. On Wednesday Williams blamed his mistake on the 'fog of memory over 12 years', but evidence has emerged since that Williams has repeatedly mis-told the story including to late night host David Letterman in 2013. Amazing feats!: Conan O'Brien also poked fun at Brian Williams in this parody video where Williams takes credit for just about everything . NBC News anchor Brian Williams' 2006 claim that he saw a dead body float past his hotel window during Hurricane Katrina is drawing fresh skepticism after he admitted to lying over an old Iraq war story . New Orleans' famous French Quarter escaped flooding during Hurricane Katrina as it is located on the highest part of the city . The anchor's previous credibility as a highly regarded journalist is based partly on his reporting from inside the New Orleans Superdome in the immediate aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in September 2005. The major story broke just months after Williams replaced Tom Brokaw as NBC News' anchor and his reporting from the devastation of New Orleans received countless plaudits and helped earn NBC a Peabody Award. In the wake of the scandal over William's war story apology, attention is now turning to comments he made about what exactly he witnessed in New Orleans in the aftermath of Katrina. 'When you look out of your hotel room window in the French Quarter and watch a man float by face down, when you see bodies that you last saw in Banda Aceh, Indonesia and swore to yourself that you would never see in your country...I beat that storm. I was there before it arrived. 'I rode it out with people who later died in the Superdome,' he said in an interview in 2006, just a year after the hurricane. The story was first broken by the GotNews.com news blog. Williams' reporting from New Orleans received countless plaudits and helped earn NBC a Peabody Award but is now being reevaluated with some skepticism following his Iraq war story climb down . According to the New Orleans Advocate, Williams claim isn't accurate as the French Quarter of the city – one of the highest parts of the city – was never flooded. The Advocate has also taken Williams to task over another Katrina-related claim that he made in an interview last year with her predecessor Brokaw. In the interview Williams claims that he had caught dysentery from drinking floodwaters during his stay in New Orleans. 'My week, two weeks there was not helped by the fact that I accidentally ingested some of the floodwater,' he said. 'I became very sick with dysentery, our hotel was overrun with gangs, I was rescued in the stairwell of a five-star hotel in New Orleans by a young police officer. We are friends to this day. And uh, it just was uh, I look back at total agony.' Those claims have also had cold water poured on them. The anchor is also in trouble over claims that he caught dysentery from drinking floodwaters while reporting on the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans in 2005 . 'I saw a lot of people with cuts and bruises and such, but I don't recall a single, solitary case of gastroenteritis during Katrina or in the whole month afterward,' Dr. Brobson Lutz, a former city health director told the Advocate. A spokeswoman from the Louisiana Department of Health and Hospitals said contaminated water sources are a possible 'transmission points' for dysentery, but that the agency doesn't track it. Elsewhere, conservative blog, SooperMexican, posted video clips on Thursday that apparently showed Williams telling two completely different stories about a New Orleans man who committed suicide during the Katrina. One clip from the Brokaw interview has Williams claim that he personally witnessed the death, while in a second clip, Williams said he 'heard the story of a man killing himself falling from the upper deck' of the New Orleans Superdome. In the same interview with Brokaw, he praised Williams, saying that with his reporting during Katrina, Williams 'took ownership, if you will, of the anchor chair' following a longtime stint as Brokaw's understudy. In a 2014 interview with Tom Brokaw, right, Williams claimed that he caught dysentery from drinking floodwaters in New Orleans - a claim that experts have said is highly unlikely .

"Peter Eveson, 39, was jailed for two years and four months after he admitted to breaking into his father's neighbour's home . A serial crook has been jailed for breaking into a house after he was accidentally shopped to police by his own father - who called the police after becoming concerned about his neighbour's burglar alarm. Peter Eveson, 39, smashed into the property on his father's street and stole jewellery and a phone on November 27 last year. Stoke-on-Trent Crown Court heard after committing the crime he then casually went to his father's house nearby for a cup of tea and a chat. But while he was there, Mr Eveson Snr became concerned as the alarm on the house his son had just raided was sounding in the street. He contacted police when he saw from his Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, home that his neighbour's patio doors had been smashed in . Eveson then became agitated prompting his dad to confront him about about the burglary and ask if he was responsible. But the thief pleaded his innocence and denied any involvement telling his father he 'would never commit such a crime on his doorstep.' He later came clean and admitted the break-in and on Thursday was jailed for two years and four months. During sentencing, Judge David Fletcher said: 'You will be 40 next year, by the time of your release probably 41. 'That may be an opportunity for you to take stock of your life. At the time it is in complete chaos.' The court heard Eveson has 39 convictions for 79 offences, including 20 previous convictions for burglary, and had committed his latest crime just days before this raid. Neil Ahuja, prosecuting, said the victim left his house secure on the afternoon of November 27 when Eveson broke in and went to his father's home at 5pm. He said: 'His father went to check as the alarm was sounding and discovered the rear patio doors had been smashed. He reported the matter to the police. 'The defendant became agitated. His father challenged him and asked if he was responsible for the burglary. 'He denied it and said he would not do it at his doorstep.' Hamish Noble, defending, said drink had been the 'chief mischief' and Eveson committed the offences to fund his alcohol addiction. Eveson, of no fixed address, pleaded guilty to two charges of burglary and asked for four other house burglaries to be taken into consideration. He also admitted two charges of criminal damage. Eveson admitted to the burglary at Stoke-on-Trent Crown Court (pictured), where it was heard he had 39 convictions for 79 offences .","Peter Eveson, 39, smashed into his father's neighbour's home last year .

"Oregon's governor is struggling to deal with allegations that his fiancee used his position to land clients for her environmental consulting business, claims that have drawn an ethics investigation and the scrutiny of the state's attorney general. Although his role in arranging the deals isn't clear, the scandal has posed a threat to the decades-long political career of four-term Democrat John Kitzhaber, Oregon's longest-serving governor. The editorial board at the state's largest newspaper, The Oregonian, called for him to resign this week, saying the controversy has become such a distraction that he can't effectively lead. Scroll down for video . Going strong: John Kitzhaber kisses fiancee, Cylvia Hayes, after he is sworn in for an unprecedented fourth term as Governor in Salem, Oregon in January 2015 . Asked to resign: The editorial board at the state's largest newspaper, The Oregonian, called for four-term Democrat John Kitzhaber to resign this week, saying the controversy has become  a distraction . Scandals: Cylvia Hayes is accused of using her fiance's position to land clients for her business and she has confessed to marrying an immigrant in exchange for $5,000, and buying land for a pot farm . Two advisers to the Republican he defeated last year took early steps Friday to begin a recall effort. A series of newspaper reports since October have chronicled Cylvia Hayes' work for organizations with an interest in Oregon public policy. During the same period, she worked as an unpaid adviser in the governor's office. The spotlight on Hayes led to her revelation that she accepted about $5,000 to illegally marry an immigrant seeking immigration benefits in the 1990s. Later, she admitted she bought a remote property with the intent to grow marijuana. 'Recent allegations relating to Gov. Kitzhaber and Ms. Hayes are very serious — and troubling,' Attorney General Ellen Rosenblum said in a statement. 'My office is considering all of our legal options to ensure that we are best serving the state.' Blinded by love?: Asked whether he's been blinded by love, the Oregon governor said he does not believe he is and he said he still plans to marry Cyvlia Hayes . Dancing with disaster: Cylvia Hayes, pictured dancing with the Oregon governor John Kitzhaber, apologized last October as she admitted to a sham marriage in the 1990s and buying land on a pot farm . Rosenblum's spokeswoman, Kristina Edmunson, would not elaborate on which allegations troubled the attorney general, who is a Democrat. Under Oregon law, the attorney general's authority to investigate and bring criminal charges is limited, but her office sometimes assists district attorneys with complex cases. Kitzhaber has repeatedly declined to appoint a special prosecutor, saying it's unnecessary. He has refused to step aside, no doubt emboldened by his re-election victory three months ago. Marriage (October 2014): Cylvia Hayes tearfully confesses to marrying an Ethopian man in exchange for $5,000 so he could become a US citizen . Marijuana Farm (October 2014): Clyvia Hayes confesses to purchasing land in Washington state in 1997 with the intent of growing marijuana . Contract Versions Change (October 2014): Hayes has maintained she did not represent clients before Oregon government agencies. One contract, however, shows she is memant to represent her client in Oregon before 'key public officials' and at 'official meetings.' Governer Speaks up(October 2014): Kitzhaber asks the Oregon Government Ethics Commission to review Hayes' contract and work in the governor's office to see that they obeyed the law. Criminal Investigation (October  2014): With an election just days away, Dennis Richardson, the Republican nominee for governor presses for a criminal investigation of Kitzhaber and Hayes . Call for resignation (February 2015):   The editorial board at the state's largest newspaper, The Oregonian, called for him to resign this week, saying the controversy has become such a distraction that he can't effectively lead . Source: Oregon Live . Even after the first strands of scandal became the centerpiece of his rival's campaign, Kitzhaber won by a larger margin than he managed four years earlier. 'I was elected by the people of this state to do a job, and I'm going to do it,' Kitzhaber said in a January 30 news conference that failed to quell the growing storm. A fiercely private person, Kitzhaber has been forced to answer embarrassing and personal questions about his relationship. In response to questions at the news conference last week, Kitzhaber told reporters that he's in love with Hayes, but he's not blinded by it. Some state leaders from his party have openly criticized him. Others have notably avoided defending him. 'The governor is facing serious challenges and he's hurting,' said Democratic Senate President Peter Courtney of Salem, a longtime legislator who has worked with Kitzhaber for decades. 'I want to be fair. I want to be compassionate. I want to do my job the best I can. I will not speculate on his future.' Kitzhaber met Hayes before the 2002 election, when he was governor and she was a candidate for the state Legislature. She lost her race, but they later reconnected after Kitzhaber's term ended. After eight years out of office, Kitzhaber was elected governor again in 2011. Hayes used the title 'first lady,' though the couple has never married, and she took an active role in his administration. They were engaged last summer. Media reports have accused Hayes of using her position to get private consulting work; earning money from companies that wanted to influence the state; and directing taxpayer funded staff to make travel arrangements on behalf of her private business. Last month, EO Media Group and Pamplin Media Group reported that Hayes earned $118,000 over two years for a fellowship with a green energy group. The Oregonian reported that the money didn't match her earnings reported on her tax returns, which she'd previously given to the newspaper. Recent engagement: Cylvia Hayes, 46,  became engaged to Governor John Kitzhaber, 67, earlier this year . Kitzhaber said the couple files taxes separately and refused to answer questions. As Kitzhaber dodged rapid-fire questions from a large contingent of media last month, Hayes was in Sweden visiting friends at her own expense, he said. She has been unavailable to comment on the tax issue. She'll travel later to Berlin for meetings with an organization that promotes using happiness to evaluate the success of economies and public policies. Deflecting questions: Kitzhaber repeatedly deflected questions about whether her work constituted a conflict of interest, saying the Oregon Government Ethics Commission will decide . The organization, funded by the German government, paid for her trip. It also paid for Hayes' 2013 travel with Kitzhaber to study happiness indicators in Bhutan. Kitzhaber repeatedly deflected questions about whether her work constituted a conflict of interest, saying the Oregon Government Ethics Commission will decide. The Oregon Government Ethics Commission has opened an inquiry and will decide in March whether a formal investigation is warranted. The commission enforces conflict of interest laws for government officials and can impose civil penalties, but can't levy criminal charges. Kitzhaber has said he and Hayes recognized the potential for conflicts between her public and private work and tried to avoid them. He said last week it's up to the ethics commission to decide whether they were successful. The recall effort, filed by the former campaign manager and policy director for Republican Dennis Richardson, would require 220,000 signatures within 90 days — a difficult and expensive task. Oregon's chief elections official, Secretary of State Kate Brown, said Friday that the recall must wait until Kitzhaber is six months into his term.","Oregon's governor is struggling to deal with allegations that his fiancee used his position to land clients for her environmental consulting business .

"The woman at the centre of the Prince Andrew 'sex slave' scandal has told a US court that she believes the FBI has videos of her having sex with Jeffrey Epstein and his 'powerful friends' while she was underage. Virginia Roberts, who alleges that she was loaned out to the Duke of York and other high-profile Epstein associates, also stated that she feared for her life while working as Epstein's 'sex slave'. It comes a week after Epstein, an American billionaire who has been convicted of soliciting underage prostitution, hit out at 'outlandish attacks' by the 'gossip media' over the case. Scroll down for video . Accusations: Virginia Roberts (right) has claimed that she was forced by  financier Jeffrey Epstein, a convicted sex offender, to have sex with Prince Andrew when she was 17, pictured together in early 2001 . Miss Roberts, 31, accuses Epstein, the Prince, and – among others – the leading American defence lawyer Alan Dershowitz of abusing her while she was underage. Prince Andrew, Ghislaine Maxwell - also named in court documents - Mr Dershowitz and Jeffrey Epstein have vigorously denied the accusations. A Buckingham Palace statement said: 'It is emphatically denied that the Duke of York had any form of sexual contact or relationship [with the woman]. 'The allegations made are false and without any foundation.' In court papers, Miss Roberts claims she was forced to have sex with the royal on three separate occasions - including an orgy - at three locations; London, New York and the US Virgin Islands. She is said to have been 17 at the time of the alleged meetings, meaning she was underage according to the law in Florida. Scandal: Prince Andrew, left, has been dragged into the controversy surrounding convicted paedophile, and former friend, Jeffrey Epstein (right). The two are pictured together in Central Park, in New York . Miss Roberts, now 31, claims that she was groomed on behalf of Epstein by Maxwell – daughter of disgraced newspaper owner Robert - when she was 15 and forced into a world of sexual abuse. In her latest court filing, submitted to a Florida court on Friday, Miss Roberts stated US authorities were holding back damning evidence of activities that she was made to engage in while working as Epstein's 'sex slave'. Swearing under oath, Miss Roberts said she knew that 'Epstein maintained videos in some rooms' where she had 'sex with other powerful people'. Evidence: In the latest filing, Miss Roberts, pictured in 2011, stated US authorities were holding back damning evidence of activities that she was made to engage in while working as Epstein's 'sex slave' She added that she believed that those videos could be used as blackmail. She said: 'Based on my knowledge of Epstein and his organization, as well as discussions with the FBI, it is my belief that federal prosecutors likely possess videotapes and photographic images of me as an underage girl having sex with Epstein and some of his powerful friends.' Miss Roberts also detailed interactions she had with investigators from the FBI that led her to believe she was the victim of a 'major cover up' - proof of Epstein's power and influence. She also claimed she was physically abused by Epstein's friends to such an extent that she feared for her life. She said: 'Without going into the details of the sexual activities I was forced to endure, there were times when I was physically abused to the point that I remember fearfully thinking that I didn’t know whether I was going to survive.' When she told Epstein about this abuse, the billionaire responded 'you get that sometimes', she stated. Roberts is seeking to join a long-running lawsuit against the US government filed by other alleged victims of Epstein to a federal court in Florida. The women claim that Epstein’s plea deal violated their constitutional rights, and that his powerful allies – including presidents and other high-profile personalities – may have helped win him special treatment. As well as the affidavit, Roberts filed previously undisclosed receipts for a flight from New York to Thailand in September 2002. There is also a receipt of a stay costing several thousand dollars at the Royal Princess hotel in Chiang Mai. All the bills appeared to have been paid for by 'J Epstein'. Roberts has previously alleged that she was sent on the Thailand trip by Epstein to learn Thai massage and interview a Thai girl 'to bring back to the United States' for him. Instead, she stated in the most recent affidavit, she saw it as a 'chance to escape' after meeting a man - now her husband - and confiding in him about her situation. Last week, Prince Andrew was pictured as he returned to his royal duties after a second attempt to have him testify about underage 'sex slave' Virginia Roberts failed.

"Never mind those little blue pills – men who have problems between the sheets could reinvigorate themselves simply by eating a Mediterranean diet. Eating fish, salads and olive oil, and enjoying the odd glass of wine, could transform the lives of men suffering from impotence, according to Greek cardiologist Athanasios Angelis. He said his research had shown that consuming such healthy foods helped clean out blood vessels, especially the narrow ones in the penis that are essential for a man to perform. Eating fish, salads and olive oil and enjoying the odd glass of wine could transform the lives of men suffering from impotence, according to Greek cardiologist Athanasios Angelis . Dr Angelis, an expert on erectile dysfunction at Hippokration Hospital in Athens, said: ‘The Mediterranean diet is well known to be a healthy diet, one that is associated with longevity, wellbeing, lower incidence of cancer and cardiovascular disease. ‘And this is very important, because people can choose this type of diet to prevent or restore their vascular health.’ He explained that when a man had problems achieving an erection, ‘it can be a sign of worse health problems to come’, because the blood vessels in the penis were ‘very, very sensitive’ to what was happening in the rest of the body. ‘Adopting a healthy diet and lifestyle can help reverse moderate erectile dysfunction,’ Dr Angelis said. Changing to a Mediterranean diet, and taking more exercise, could be so effective in some men that they would not have to rely on Viagra any longer, he added. Changing to a Mediterranean diet, and taking more exercise, could be so effective in some men that they would not have to rely on Viagra any longer . ‘What those pills do is substitute substances that can’t be produced in the body due to poor vascular health. They help restore a proper vascular response. But if we can restore vascular function by adopting a healthy lifestyle, we can reverse at least the first stages of the disease without drugs.’ He recommended plenty of cereals, fruit and vegetables, salads, nuts, olive oil, fish and poultry – but no kebabs. Red meat, once per week, is enough, he said. He also recommended two or three small glasses of wine a day.

"Tony Blair is to join the fight to get Ed Miliband elected, despite growing unease among New Labour grandees after the direction of the party. The former prime minister has promised to do 'whatever the party wants' to secure a Labour victory in May. Some senior Labour MPs argue that the three-times election winner remains a 'rock star' who can still win over voters, but there is unease among some of Mr Miliband's allies about turning the clock back to the Blair era. Tony Blair is to join the fight to get Ed Miliband elected, despite growing unease among New Labour grandees after the direction of the party . Labour still has a narrow lead in the opinion polls but a survey today showed the party has been damaged by public rows with senior business leaders. Mr Miliband is now widely seen as anti-business, with captains of industry who once backed Mr Blair now warning of the disastrous impact of a Labour victory in May's election. Last month Mr Blair warned that  fighting on a 'traditional left-wing' platform was a recipe for defeat for Labour, and was widely seen to have been a criticism of Mr Miliband's shift from the political centreground. On Friday it emerged two of Mr Blair's close New Labour allies - Lord Mandelson and Alastair Campbell - spoke to Alan Johnson about rumours he was willing to replace Mr Miliband as Labour leader. Both men denied urging Mr Johnson to launch a leadership challenger, but it was seen as the latest sign of New Labour veterans' unhappiness with Mr Miliband. However, Mr Blair has now signalled that he is ready to campaign for Labour in the run up to the general election in three months' time. The former PM's office told The Observer that regarding 'his involvement in the party's election campaign, he will do whatever the party wants'. However, MailOnline understands that there is unease among some of Mr Miliband's team, and MPs elected in 2010, about being seen to rely on Mr Blair for support. Rows about delays to the Iraq War inquiry have reignited the division in the Labour party about Mr Blair's decision to back the 2003 invasion. 'I'm not sure we would want him,' said one Labour frontbencher. 'It would look a bit odd after Ed has done so much to distance himself from New Labour and Iraq and all of that.' Mr Blair campaigned in some seats in 2010, including Redditch for former home secretary Jacqui Smith, who went on to lose her seat . Mr Blair also campaigned in Oldham and Saddleworth, which Labour later won in an election re-run, and his appearance at Trimdon Labour club during the 2010 campaign was targeted by anti-Iraq war protesters . Half of voters think the Labour party has been damaged by recent attacks from senior business. Industry leaders credited with the success of well-known chains including Boots, M&S, Pizza Express and Lastminute.com have turned their fire on Labour in recent days, warning victory for Mr Miliband would plunge Britain into an economic catastrophe. A YouGov poll for The Sunday Times shows 52 per cent of people think the criticism damages Labour, while only 7 per cent think it helps them. Overall, some 43 per cent of voters think a Labour victory would be bad for British business while just 19 per cent think it would be good. Only 19 per cent think Labour has the best policies towards British business, compared to 33 per cent who said the same of the Conservatives. In a fresh blow, Chris Wright, founder of the music publishing giant Chrysalis who backed Labour in the run-up to the 2005 election, warned Labour risked stoking a 'politics of envy' that would damage Britain's economic prospects. 'In the current Labour leadership there's a vein of thought that is to some extent anti-wealth creator and antibusiness and that is a great shame,' he said. However, others want to see Mr Blair back on the campaign trail, as he did in some seats in the run-up to the 2010 election when his great rival Gordon Brown was seeking election. A shadow cabinet minister said: 'Tony is a rock star. In the right seats people still love seeing him, it is a bit of celebrity stardust on the campaign trail.' A poll for the Observer showed the Opposition up one point from a fortnight ago on 34%, two ahead of the Conservatives, unchanged on 32 per cent. Ukip dropped three points to 15 per cent in the Opinium research while the Greens and the Liberal Democrats both moved up two points to 8 per cent and 7 per cent respectively. Mr Miliband remained significantly less well regarded than Tory Prime Minister David Cameron - with a satisfaction score of minus 26 to the PM's minus five. Lord Mandelson, one of the architects of New Labour, said Mr Miliband  'will make a very good prime minister' and suggested  corporate leaders 'will become much more reassured' about the Opposition's stance by the time of May's general election. The peer accepted that more needed to be done to counter the impression being created but said the criticism was a deliberate attempt to misrepresent the party's position. 'We've got two months to show that he can make the case,' he said. 'I believe he has, but I believe there is a determination also to portray him in a very negative way.' He and ex-Downing Street media chief Mr Campbell contacted Mr Johnson over speculation that he was being lined up by MPs seeking to oust Mr Miliband. But both countered a claim in the Financial Times they  'took soundings to see whether he was prepared to take over' insisting they did nothing more than ascertain from a friend that the rumours he was being lined up were untrue. Mr Johnson served in the Cabinet for six years and was seen as a safe pair of hands, popular with the media and the public. After Mr Miliband won the Labour leadership he appointed Mr Johnson as shadow chancellor, but he remained in post for just three months, resigning after revelations about his wife having an affair. However, many still view the former postman and trade union leader as a possible caretaker leader if Mr Miliband's woeful personal ratings risked prevent Labour winning the election. Peter Mandelson and Alastair Campbell held talks with Alan Johnson amid growing speculation that he would take the helm of the party to prevent a second election defeat . Mr Johnson has ruled out ever standing for the Labour leadership, to the dismay of his many supporters in the party . New Labour supporters were seen as being closer to Mr Miliband's brother David, but he stepped down as an MP after losing the leadership against to his brother. At least 40 Labour MPs are believed to have backed the abortive coup, which occurred weeks after the Labour leader's conference speech last autumn. Tensions between Mr Miliband and New Labour grandees have been renewed in recent days, after losing the support of business leaders seen as crucial to Mr Blair's three election triumphs. The leadership speculation came at the end of a week when captains of industry and entrepreneurs have lined up to warn against a Labour victory. Business leaders credited with the success of well-known chains including Boots, M&S, Pizza Express and Lastminute.com have turned their fire on Labour in recent days, warning victory for Mr Miliband would plunge Britain into an economic catastrophe. Sir Charles Dunstone, who was one of 63 signatories to a letter of support for Labour in 2005, told the Financial Times the business community felt 'isolated' by Labour's shift to the left. 'As a business person I'm frightened of an environment where there isn't sufficient emphasis put on growing the economy to grow tax receipts to spend more money,' he said. However, Lord Levy, formerly Tony Blair's chief fundraiser who helped New Labour form close ties with business, said he was 'saddened' by the attacks on Mr Miliband.","Ex-prime minister promises to do 'whatever the party wants' in election .

"Six out of every 10 women illegally immigrating into the U.S. are estimated to be victims of sexual violence, and many are reportedly taking birth control to avoid unwanted pregnancies. Sexual assaults such as the March incident where a border patrol agent raped and tried to kill a woman and her teen daughter along the Texas - Mexico border before fleeing with the girl’s twin sister have led to illegals seeking out birth control for protection. That incident is only one of many, most going unreported and failing to ever see prosecution because victims are afraid of reprisals against their families and deportation. The silent sufferers: The majority of women crossing the border are sexually assaulted, according to at least one estimate . The female immigrants often take injections costing about $4 that prevent pregnancy for up to one month, a pharmacist told Fronteras Desk. The assaults come at the hands of guides, officers and even fellow immigrants – they often go unpunished. Others take pills – a prescription is not required to buy birth control in Mexico, Anna Ochoa O'Leary, a professor in the Department of Mexican American Studies and a member of the Binational Migration Institute at the University of Arizona, told Fox News. ‘The women passing through here know that they’re going to be raped,’ Father Pedraza, director of a shelter for migrants in a Mexican border town told Fox News. ‘Migrants are a vulnerable group, and the most vulnerable among them are women,’ he added. Among those vulnerable immigrants were the three Honduran women unlucky enough to come into contact last month with U.S. Customs and Border Patrol agent Esteban Manzanares. Fear of consequences: The fear of deportation or actions against their families keep the women from reporting abuse . The deranged man dragged the mother and her 14-year-old twin daughters to a remote field where he raped the mother and slashed her wrists and raped one of the twin girls and tried to break her neck, police said. He then fled the remote field with the other teen girl and restrained her in his apartment before returning home later in the day to rape her before committing suicide as SWAT officers moved in on his home, reports said. All three women survived the ordeal, but they will never see justice for the horrific assaults – they are not alone. ‘What can I do in case I’m raped, and I don’t want to get pregnant?’ The pharmacist told Fronteras she is asked by women preparing to make the dangerous trip across the border. ‘What can I use?’ The women are often told by their guides – aptly named coyotes – to take the medicine ‘because the coyotes know what they are going to do in the middle of the desert,’ the pharmacist lamented. Even police assault the women: Esteban Manzanares reportedly raped three women and tried to kill two of them before committing suicide . What happens in the desert usually stays in the desert. The rapes are almost never prosecuted. ‘An estimated six out of 10 migrant women and girls experience sexual violence, allegedly prompting some people smugglers to demand that women receive contraceptive injections ahead of the journey, to avoid them falling pregnant as a result of rape,’ Amnesty International reported. ‘Migrants in Mexico are facing a major human rights crisis leaving them with virtually no access to justice, fearing reprisals and deportation if they complain of abuses,’ according to a researcher for the human rights organization. Even instances where illegal immigrants reported the rapes often lead to a lack of prosecution, authorities lamented to Fronteras. Remote: The women are often isolated as they trek through remote mountain and desert regions . Investigators submit DNA samples to a national database in the hopes a match will pop up, but even matches pose challenges to prosecution because it is ‘nearly impossible’ to find deported victims. ‘They could live in a small little town where there are just shacks and they don’t have running water or phones, they have to go to another town that may be an hour’s drive away just to get information that someone is looking for them or messages relayed to them,’ an official griped. But there is a glimmer of hope for one abused young girl. The 14-year-old and her group were captured trying to cross the border. Her attacker, himself a coyote, faces decades behind bars after being accused of raping her at least twice during their trip. ‘Finally, finally we were able to be successful and hopefully catch someone we could hold accountable,’ an official told Fronteras. He sadly is only one of many suspected rapists, most of whom continue to sexually assault women with impunity.","About 60 per cent of all illegal female immigrants are estimated to face some kind of sexual violence .

Detective Superintendent Pat Twiggs, head of crime for Leeds District, said: ‘A 51-year-old man, from Baildon, was arrested as part of an investigation into potential drugs offences following an article in a national Sunday newspaper about a member of staff at Leeds General Infirmary. ‘He was subsequently released on police bail pending further inquiries.’ Dr Ferrie, 51, is being investigated by the same police team that looked into the drug-taking of former Co-Op Bank chairman Rev Paul Flowers, following our exposure of his secret life in November 2013. Inquiries into Ferrie began last month after the Mail on Sunday printed photos taken from a video appearing to show the paediatric neurologist snorting cocaine and taking 'date rape' drug GHB . Flowers was convicted and fined £525 after he admitted possession of cocaine, crystal meth and ketamine. Leeds Infirmary has suspended Dr Ferrie and the General Medical Council has withdrawn his registration, meaning he cannot practice as a doctor. Last night Mr Ferrie’s lawyer said: ‘Dr Colin Ferrie is co-operating with the West Yorkshire Police investigation. He has no further comment to make.’ Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Dr Colin Ferrie arrested on suspicion of involvement in supply of Class As .

"A  33-year-old father-of-six suspected of killing his wife and their neighbor before going to a church and shooting their pastor dead has been caught and is in custody. Andres 'Andy' Avalos is said to have started his killing spree in the city of Bradenton, around 45 miles south of Tampa Bay, on Thursday afternoon. Detectives were called to the Bayshore Baptist Church where they found father-of-two James 'Tripp' Battle, 31, dead in the courtyard. Authorities were then led to a home nearby where they discovered the bodies of Amber Avalos, 33, the suspect's wife of 15 years, and neighbor Denise Potter, 45. Victims: Amber Avalos, 33, the suspect's wife, and pastor of Bayshore Baptist Church in Bradenton, Florida, James 'Tripp' Battle, 31, were killed during a shooting spree on Thursday . Wanted: Police are now searching for Andres 'Andy' Avalos who was last seen at the church where Mr Battle was found dead. He was married to Amber for 20 years and the pair had six children together . Investigators with the Manatee County Sheriff's Office say Avalos, whose father is a minister, was last seen near the church driving a gold Chevrolet Suburban. The car was found at a Walmart 11 miles away from the church on Friday. They believe he was under the influence of drugs during the attacks. 'We don't know exactly what transpired,' said sheriff's spokesman Dave Bristow. However he added that the incident had stemmed from a 'domestic situation' and wasn't random. When asked if it was a crime of passion, Bristow told reporters it was a 'possibility'. His wife Amber was the children's director at the church while two of Potter's sons, aged 14 and seven, also worked there. According to the Bayshore Baptist website Mr Battle and his wife, Joy, who is the church's secretary, have a five-year-old daughter and a two-year-old son. The pastor is also believed to have counselled the suspect while he was having problems with his marriage. Mr Battle's father Jimmy told the Tampa Bay Times that he believed Avalos was paranoid and began suspecting every man that walked pass his wife. Sheriff Brad Steube said Battle and Avalos met face-to-face in the church courtyard shortly before the shooting. Killed: Police also found the body of 45-year-old Denise Potter, who lived next to the suspect and his wife . 'The pastor saw this coming, they were facing each other' he told the newspaper. Leslie Howell, who had been renting the home out to the family for the last three years, said she had vague suspicions the couple were having problems because of the poor condition of the home. One of Amber Avalos' sisters, who lived in the same home with her three children, arrived at the scene shortly after police. She said the couple had been together for more than 20 years but suggested Avalos had substance abuse problems. She said: 'He's crazy, he's psychotic. He takes drugs and he drinks a lot.' Patrick Duff, her partner, said that Mrs Avalos had left her husband a couple of months before but he had returned home. Judy Smith, a friend of the family, told the Sarasota Herald Tribune that Alavos loved his children but was 'sick' and had a lot of problems. As news of the deaths broke, the devastated church community tried to unite and support the families of the victims. 'We have to be strong for Joy,' church member Linda Stewart told the Bradenton Herald. 'I don't know how she will get through this.' E.W 'Karp' Carpenter, a member of the church since the 1950s, told the newspaper that Battle 'was a great pastor,' and that the church's congregation grew from 30 to more than 100 under his stewardship. 'He was 31 years old and would give you shirt off his back,' Carpenter said. Family: Mr Battle and his wife, Joy, (pictured) who is the church's secretary, have a five-year-old daughter and a two-year-old son . Cause: Authorities believe that Avalos (pictured with wife Amber) was not acting randomly and the deadly incident stemmed from a domestic situation . Marking: Police have released a close-up of a tattoo on the murder suspect's neck which says 'RIP Carnallo' Tragic: Mrs Avalos was the children's director at the church and had lived in the city all her life. Her sister claimed that her husband, who is now on the run, had problems with substance abuse and was 'psychotic' Jane Riley, a neighbor of the Avalos family, told The Associated Press that the neighborhood near the Manatee River is 'like the sweetest little community,' although she did point out that in 2008, a previous tenant of the Avaloses' home was slain during a home invasion. 'Now I'm scared,' said Riley. 'I have an alarm system, but is that enough? I hope the cops hang around for a while.' Investigators say Avalos should be considered dangerous. Anyone who sees him should call police. Four schools were put on lockdown following the shootings, fearing Avalos would try and pick up one of his six children. Avalos has several previous arrests; among are five in Hillsborough County. The most recent was on a DUI charge in 2012. According to the Herald, he was also shot in the arm during an altercation with another man in 2003. He held a gun to his head and during a following argument, the weapon went off. Scene: Detectives were called to Bayshore Baptist Church on Thursday where they found the body of Mr Battle.

"Police have identified the gunman and victims in an apparent murder-suicide in a quiet neighborhood near Atlanta. Cedric Prather, 33, shot dead his ex-wife Latoya Andrews, also 33, and two of her four children aged seven and nine - before turning the gun on himself. A man named Joseph Terry Brown, 33, was also killed at the house in Douglasville, west of Atlanta, Georgia. Ms Andrews' two other children, an eight-year-old and a 15-year-old, are in a critical but stable condition in hospital. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO .

"More potential victims of the cop who allegedly brutally beat a great grandmother on the side of the road have come forward, MailOnline can reveal. A number of people have contacted pressure group Los Angeles Urban Policy Roundtable since sickening footage of Marlene Pinnock being repeatedly punched in the head by a Highway Patrol officer went viral. The new witnesses say they recognize the cop from the video as someone they have had aggressive run-ins with in the past. Scroll down for video . Victim: Footage shows Marlene Pinnock, 51 (pictured) being brutally beaten by a California Highway Patrol officer on the side of a Los Angeles highway . At this stage the claims are unsubstantiated, but sources at LAUPR are determined to thoroughly investigate them in an attempt to determine whether the policeman in question has a history of violence. There has been no suggestion that this is the case up to this point. According to the LA Times, the officer in question has been placed on an 'administrative assignment' out of the field following the attack on Mrs Pinnock, 51, which took place on the side of an LA highway a week ago. But news he is on full pay, and the California Highway Patrol's refusal to publicly name him has infuriated Mrs Pinnock's family and civil rights campaigners. And if the claims that he has a history of aggressive behavior prove correct, the anger is likely to grow even stronger. A LAUPR source told MailOnline: 'We have received emails from people who say they recognize the policeman from the video. 'They have said they have been stopped by him in the past and he was very aggressive towards them. Obviously these claims are unsubstantiated at the moment, but we would be foolish not to check them out. 'At . this stage it is impossible to say whether they are valid or not. For . all we know this officer could have an exemplary service record up to . this point. 'But if they are legitimate it will raise some incredibly tough questions for the California Highway Patrol. This is why we need to know the identity of the officer in question. We . need to be able to check his record to see if he has a history of this . kind of behavior. His identity should be a matter of public record.' Attack: Motorist David Diaz filmed a California Highway Patrol officer straddle a woman while punching her in the head on the Interstate 10 in Los Angeles . Attack: On July 1, motorist David Diaz filmed a California Highway Patrol officer punching a woman in the head and shoulder after she'd walked barefoot along the Interstate 10 west of downtown Los Angeles . Attack: Several people have claimed they recognize the California Highway Patrol officer in the footage of the July 1 assault because they'd also had run-ins with him . Mrs Pinnock had been walking barefoot on eastbound Interstate 10 west of downtown Los Angeles  before she was tackled to the ground by the officer. A passing driver videotaped the incident showing the CHP trooper pinning her down and repeatedly punching her in the face. The victim's family have hired Los Angeles attorney Caree Harper to represent them in the case against the California Highway Patrol. Harper said her clients want the authorities held accountable for 'beating a great-grandmother in broad daylight.' Mrs Pinnock has been named locally, but the lawyer declined to identify her or answer questions about what she was doing along the edge of one of the city's busiest freeways. 'We want the focus to be what he was doing to her, not what she was doing' prior to the confrontation, said Harper. 'She was getting beat like an animal. No one should ever be beat like that.' Speaking on Saturday Mrs Pinnock’s daughter Mayisha Allums told KTLA: 'He punched and pound and pound on her, the only thing she could do was block her face.’ Devastated: Marlene Pinnock's daughter Maisha Allums (pictured) said her 'loving' mother was beaten 'like an animal' As of Monday Mrs Pinnock was in an undisclosed hospital where she was undergoing a mental health evaluation. The California Highway Patrol has vowed to carry out a thorough investigation - but authorities claimed the trooper in question simply stopped her for her own protection. CHP Assistant Chief Chris O'Quinn said at a news conference that the woman was endangering herself and people in traffic, and the officer was forced to restrain her. O'Quinn added that the woman had begun walking off the freeway but returned when the confrontation occurred. Passing motorist David Diaz recorded the uniformed officer as he jabbed Mrs Pinnock at least 11 times in the head Tuesday. 'The most animalistic, most brutal way to subdue someone is to pound someone's head into the concrete with really big blows to the head,' Diaz told ABC7. 'There was no weapons - it's obviously excess force,' he continued. 'He starts really letting loose... He starts pounding down on her face really hard. He doesn't try to grab her hands first.' Outraged: Motorist David Diaz (pictured) who filmed the altercation on his cell phone, said the cop used excessive force on an unarmed woman . On Monday Los Angeles civil rights activists met with California Highway Patrol Asst. Commissioner Ramona Prieto to discuss the incident. The Rev. William D. Smart Jr., head of the Los Angeles chapter of the Southern Christian Leadership Alliance, attended the meeting and he told The LA Times he is 'enraged' by the video. He added: ‘We’re very angry. Our community is highly upset over this - that a black woman was being hit that way, treated that way. There’s a rage in our community right now.' A second meeting is scheduled for Tuesday. Lawyers and campaigners will make a string of demands of the CHP. Most importantly, they will insist that the officer in question is names immediately, so checks can be made into his background. They will also call for a quick and thorough investigation and a review and revamp of officer training with the aim of avoiding any similar, brutal incidents in future.","Footage shows a California Highway Patrol officer repeatedly punch Marlene Pinnock, 51, in Los Angeles last week .

"Brain cancer patient Ashya King has recovered to such a degree that his family hope he will soon be walking unaided. The five-year-old, whose parents sparked an international manhunt and fears for his life when they took him out of hospital to seek treatment abroad, is making ‘steady progress’ four months after undergoing pioneering proton beam therapy in the Czech Republic. Writing on the family’s Facebook page, Ashya’s older brother, Naveed, said: ‘Ashya’s progress is steady and hopefully soon he can make his first step alone.’ Improving: Ashya, pictured centre, has been in good spirits more recently. His father is in the background . Ashya’s parents, Brett and Naghmeh, whisked him from Southampton General Hospital last August, boarded a ferry and drove 1,300 miles to their Spanish holiday home. Their plan was to sell the property to fund the proton beam therapy, which costs at least £50,000. Ashya underwent 30 therapy sessions in Prague in September and October. His parents feared the NHS treatment he was due to receive, combining ‘conventional’ radiotherapy and chemotherapy, would have damaging side effects. Proton beam therapy typically causes less damage to surrounding healthy tissue. His UK doctors argued it would bring no extra benefits – but the NHS did eventually pay for his treatment in Prague. Ashya also underwent an operation to remove his tumour last summer, appearing very weak afterwards. But now he has recovered to such an extent that he is behaving like a normal, boisterous five-year-old, according to worshippers at the church the family attends in San Pedro de Alcantara, near Marbella. One described him as ‘full of life – and even arguing with his parents’. Weak: Ashya when he arrived at a hospital in the Czech Republic, to begin pre-cancer treatment in September . Supportive: Five-year-old Ashya with his parents, Brett and Naghmeh, in hospital in September . Meanwhile, leading doctors are warning that Ministers are about to squander £250 million because the equipment chosen for two proton beam treatment centres in the UK is based on ‘old technology’. Cancer expert Professor Karol Sikora said the enormous facilities, in London and Manchester, could soon be ‘concrete mausoleums’, while leading obstetrician Sir Marcus Setchell, who delivered Prince George, said the NHS should ‘seriously consider’ newer designs. The NHS has all but chosen Hitachi to supply machines for two centres, but the experts argue that newer, smaller units are available. Prof Sikora said: ‘It’s illogical to go for the big machines today. It’s old technology, basically, and it’s been superseded.’ He claimed the NHS was being over-cautious and was a victim of its own ‘unbelievably slow’ buying process. The Department of Health said it was satisfied the best equipment was being bought.","Cancer patient Ashya was whisked from Southampton Hospital last August .

"For nearly a century, the vast hull of the German ship that sank during the First World War has been mostly hidden from view. But the violent storms that lashed Britain have laid bare the wreck of the SV Carl. Giant waves have stripped away almost 3ft of sand, revealing the steel ribs of the 60ft vessel at its final resting place at Booby’s Bay near Padstow in north Cornwall. Scroll down for video . Emerged from the storms: The well preserved wreck of a German ship that sank nearly 100 years ago during the First World War has been exposed after a beach was stripped of sand . At war: Germany's SV Carl has been mainly hidden for almost a century at remote the remote Booby's Bay, near Padstow, in Cornwall . Remnants: Experts say that the bad weather since December has stripped away tons of sand, which has revealed the hull and masts of the German ship . History: The SV Carl was captured by British forces during the First World War and was being towed to London when it sank on October 7 1917 . Filmmaker Crispin Sadler made the . discovery while holidaying  near the remote location. ‘We’ve always . known there was a wreck there, but had no idea there was this much of it . still there until  now,’ he said. It . was in a fierce storm on October 7, 1917 that the Carl met  its fate. It is believed that the ship, which was registered in Hamburg, was in . Cardiff docks at the outbreak of the war in 1914 and so was impounded. Three years later it was being towed to London to be broken up for scrap . when it broke free in the storm. In . a letter to the Padstow Echo in 1966, Lieutenant Commander Langford of . the Royal Navy, recalled his mother’s eyewitness account of the Carl’s . demise. ‘The Carl went aground on the outer reef,’ he wrote. ‘Two Admiralty tugs came from Devonport to try to refloat her. Operation: The stricken vessel was eventually washed ashore and was stripped of anything useful - but the 60ft wooden shell was left behind . Once submerged: The SV Carl was captured by British forces during the First World War and was being towed to London when it sank on October 7 1917 . Mesmerising: The relic of the First World War is remarkably well after being caked in tons of sand for almost a century . Magical: Parts of the ship can be seen at certain parts of the year but experts say that the recent bad weather has revealed much more of the German ship than usual . Discovery: Filmmaker Crispin Sadler was enjoying a half-term trip to the idyllic Cornish beauty spot when he took pictures of the remarkable structure. Iconic: Booby's Bay in Cornwall is a remote spot on the north edge of the county's coastline and adjoins Constantine Bay, which both feature spectacular rock formations . ‘They . got her off the reef, but as soon as they had done so, the towing . hawser [cable] on each tug parted, Carl went ahead out of control and . grounded on the inner reef (only a few yards from the shore as we know). ‘She . was there examined by salvage experts … who found no damage whatever to . the hull. The Admiralty tugs therefore had another try to tow her off, . but once more both ship’s towing harnesses parted. Carl broke her back . and became a total loss. But for the unusual misfortune of both towing . hawsers parting on two successive attempts Carl would in all probability . have been salvaged (as a prize of war, of course).’ The . ship was stripped of anything useful and left to rot. Mr Sadler made . his way to the site after realising that the recent violent storms would . have altered the landscape. ‘I . reckon about a metre of sand has been stripped off this beach and . although I have seen some of this wreckage in the past, I have never . seen so much as this time,’ he said. ‘The majority of the ship was . salvaged and this is all that is left, which is in remarkably good . condition from being under the sand all these years.’ But it’s already disappearing again. Mr Sadler said the sand was beginning to return. These 5,000-year-old trees have emerged on a beach in Mid Wales after peat was washed away during the recent storms . Scientists knew the forest was there as stumps could sometimes be seen at low tide, but these new remains have appeared further north than the previous sightings . Discovered: The tank traps were uncovered on rest Bay in Porthcrawl, South Wales in the aftermath of the storms that have swept the country . Barricades: They formed part of an enormous line of coastal defences to prevent tanks from advancing inland . Destroyed: The empty spaces where beach huts used to stand in Southbourne Beach, Dorset . Hit the huts: The most exposed shelters were flattened in the storm which hit the beach in Bournemouth .","Much of the remains of the SV Carl have .

"Everton legend Kevin Sheedy has launched a scathing attack on David Moyes, condemning the Manchester United manager’s attitude and tactics. Sheedy, who won two league titles during a 10-year playing career at Goodison Park, is Everton’s Under 18 coach and has worked at the club’s academy since 2006. He took to Twitter after United’s 3-0 defeat by Liverpool on Sunday and pulled no punches as he claimed Moyes ‘never took any interest in our youth team or players’.

Game over: Liverpool striker Luis Suarez celebrates scoring his side's third goal as United prepare to kick-off . Sheedy played for Everton for a decade between 1982 and 1992, making 314 appearances and scoring 77 goals. The left winger lifted the First Division title at Goodison in 1985 and 1987, the 1984 FA Cup and the 1985 European Cup-Winners' Cup. Sheedy now manages the club's Under-18 side after joining as a youth coach in 2006. During his 11 years at Goodison Park, Moyes gave debuts to teenage talents such as England internationals Wayne Rooney, Jack Rodwell and Ross Barkley but Sheedy countered: ‘In my seven years Moyes showed no interest in our youth team.’ The tweets were subsequently deleted but there is no doubt the comments will upset the Scot. But Sheedy did not remove the tweets in which he said ‘Punt the ball up to Fellaini. Great viewing’ and ‘We now have a manager who wants to win games’, a reference to how some Evertonians viewed Moyes as a negative-thinking boss. He also did not disagree with one Twitter user who suggested Moyes was ‘arrogant’.

But Martinez, who sat next to Roy Hodgson at Old Trafford on Sunday, has assured England’s head coach that the 20-year-old has made a full recovery from a broken toe. ‘Is he ready to give something back to the England squad?’ asked Martinez. ‘The answer is “yes”.

"He has been nicknamed 'the poorest president in the world', but the President of Uruguay proved that he has a generous nature, at least, when he recently gave a lift to an unsuspecting hitchhiker. Gerhald Acosta had been forced to leave his job at the Montes del Plata paper mill early and was walking home from work  when a good Samaritan offered to give him a lift. The shocked hitchhiker told a local newspaper that it was only as he got into the car  - the president's iconic 1987 blue Volkswagen Beetle - that he recognised that the elderly couple was actually President Jose Mujica and his wife Sen. Lucia Topolansky. Gerhald Acosta had been forced to leave his job at the Montes del Plata paper mill early and was walking home from work when a President Jose Mujica (pictured) offered to give him a lift . Gerhald told El Observador newspaper in Uruguay that 25-30 cars had already passed him by without stopping when the big-hearted head of state came to his rescue: 'I couldn’t believe it. The president was giving me a ride. 'When I got out, I thanked them profusely, because not everyone helps someone out on the road, and much less a president.' The accommodating president and his wife even allowed Gerhald to take a couple of photographs as a memento during the short journey, which he later uploaded onto his Facebook page. President Mujica and his wife are well-known for their humble lifestyle. Mujica, a former leftist Tupamaro guerrilla leader, famously eschewed the presidential palace after he took office in 2010, and continues to live in a ramshackle farm which is in his wife's name. He once declared that his blue Beetle - a symbol of his famously austere lifestyle - was his only asset, and he is thought to donate much of his £7,200-a-month ($11,000) salary to homeless charities. President Mujica and his wife are well-known for their humble lifestyle. Mujica once declared that his 1987 Volkswagen Beetle - a symbol of his famously austere lifestyle - was his only asset . Since he assumed the presidency in 2010, Mujica has been dubbed the 'most humble' president in the world . Earlier this year, the president estimated his total assets were worth £213,000 ($322,883), which is still far more modest that most world leaders. Since he assumed the presidency, liberal Mujica has led a radical overhaul of drug policies in Uruguay, setting a blueprint for other Latin American countries, and is also known for championing women's and gay rights.

Commenting on his position, Mujica once told Al Jazeera: 'A president is a high-level official who is elected to carry out a function. He is not a king, not a god. He is not the witch doctor of a tribe who knows everything. 'He is a civil servant. I think the ideal way of living is to live like the vast majority of people whom we attempt to serve and represent.'

"When a California care home shut down  last year, at least 16 elderly residents were left behind, some of whom were sick and bedridden. But while most staff at the now-infamous Valley Springs Manor abandoned the facility when they stopped getting paid, two stayed on. Now,  janitor Miguel Alvarez and cook Maurice Rowland have explained their reasons for remaining at the assisted living home in Castro Valley. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . 'Hero': Janitor Miguel Alvarez (pictured) and cook Maurice Rowland stayed behind at Valley Springs Manor in Castor Valley in Alameda County, California, after it was shut down and abandoned by its owners and staff . Care home: At least 16 elderly residents were left behind at the facility (pictured), some of whom were sick . Speaking to National Public Radio's 'Morning Edition', Mr Rowland, 35, said: 'There was about 16 residents left behind, and we had a conversation in the kitchen, ""What are we going to do?""' 'If we left, they wouldn't have nobody,' 34-year-old Mr Alvarez concluded. Valley Springs Manor, which homed senior citizens with dementia and other ailments, was shut down on October 24, 2013, after its operator's license was suspended. The suspension was reportedly the result of a long list of violations, including  failing to properly train employees or run criminal background checks and making false claims to regulators.

Stepping up: Following the 'mass evacuation' of staff, Mr Rowland and Mr Alvarez (pictured in a Facebook photo with an unknown woman) were forced to work together to provide round-the-clock care for residents . Owners abandoned the Alameda County facility after placing a sign reading 'closed for business' on its front door, ABC 7 reported at the time. Although some residents were removed by their loved ones, at least 16 - as many as 19, according to a number of reports - were left behind with nowhere to go. Following the subsequent 'mass evacuation' of staff, Mr Rowland and Mr Alvarez were forced to work together to provide round-the-clock care for residents. This included frantically changing patients' diapers, as well as bathing and trying to feed them. 'I would only go home for one hour, take a shower, get dressed, then be there for 24-hour days,' said Mr Alvarez, a stay-at-home father of a son and a stepson. Closed: Valley Springs Manor was shut down on October 24, 2013, after its operator's license was suspended. Owners abandoned the facility after placing a sign reading 'closed for business' (pictured) on its front door . Mr Rowland added that many of the pensioners - who quickly became his 'family' - could not take care of themselves and may have been seriously injured if left alone. 'I just couldn't see myself going home - next thing you know, they're in the kitchen trying to cook their own food and burn the place down,' he said. The pair - who each earned around $8-an-hour at the care home, but were paid nothing after the facility's suspension -  spent several days caring for residents. However, they decided to call 911 on October 26 out of concern for the pensioners' health and welfare, according to the San Francisco Chronicle. Sheriff's deputies and firefighters shortly arrived at the scene, before rescuing residents from the home. Most of the patients were later taken to hospitals in the area. As the incident hit the headlines, police said officers and county social services officials had been assured that patients would be cared for over the weekend after the suspension was issued. They said they believed new places were being found for the residents, but this was not the case. Over the past year, Mr Alvarez and Mr Rowland have received a number of awards and commendations for their actions, which many have deemed 'heroic'. The shocking incident also prompted California authorities to create new legislation, known as the Residential Care for the Elderly Reform Act of 2014. The Act aims to ensure care home residents are not abandoned by owners and staff in the future.

"British inventor Sir James Dyson has revealed he is working on an affordable robot to carry out chores around the house. The entrepreneur said this week he will announce a £5 million investment in a new robotics laboratory at Imperial College London to develop the technology. Sir James said soon a 'new generation of robot that understands the world around them will be able to clean the house, put out the bins and even keep an eye out for intruders'. Inventor James Dyson has said he will invest £5million in a new robotics laboratory . Sir James claims his firm currently competing with Japanese rivals to become the first to create an advanced generation of household robots. Twendy-One, a humanoid robot that can . help with housework and nursing care, has already been unveiled by . Waseda University in Tokyo and will be on sale within a few years. It has also been speculated that Google . is building an android army after recently acquiring a number of robotic . and artificial intelligence companies. Sir James told MailOnline: 'Domestic use will be the initial focus of the research. What robots need to function in the home is vision and the ability to interact intelligently.' Last year, Dyson launched a £150million facility full of robots - but Sir James admits they are inefficient: 'They perform precise, highly controlled movements in an environment that doesn’t change. 'In a complex environment – the home or garden – a machine must understand and perceive its environment. Such technology would have wide ranging application. This is a starting point, and we will have to see where it leads - and that is what's exciting.' Sir James Dyson unveils his invention, the Airblade Tap hand drier, in Hamburg, Germany .

The £5million investment is crucial . for the UK to catch up with markets in the US and Japan, where robots . are already a growing commodity, Sir James claims. He . told MailOnline: 'The US and Japan are leading the charge. Always the . early adopters, they aren't afraid of taking risks when it comes to new . technology. 'They have seen the unprecedented potential in robotics and are actively investing in research and development. 'That . doesn't mean to say we don't have the capability here in the UK.

"It is called Happy Valley, but the landscape of the BBC’s new crime drama is unrelentingly bleak. The programme has drawn criticism for showing ‘gratuitous’ violence in a string of graphic scenes. In Tuesday’s episode, the lead character - police sergeant Catherine Cawood, played by Sarah Lancashire - was savagely beaten in a basement. WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT . Beaten: In Tuesday's episode of Happy Valley, the lead character - police sergeant Catherine Cawood, played by Sarah Lancashire - was savagely beaten in a basement. Above, Cawood is pictured following the beating . As the show ended, she collapsed in the road, her face covered in blood, leaving viewers guessing whether she had died. It followed a harrowing incident last week in which another policewoman was murdered on a lonely country road. The camera panned into her terrified face as she was repeatedly run over by a car, before her body was shown lying in a pool of blood. An average of 5.8million viewers tuned in to Happy Valley’s first four instalments, and most praise its gripping plot and realistic police procedure.

Above, Cawood is beaten against the windows of the basement . But some have expressed concern at its increasingly gruesome twists and graphic depictions of violence against women. Reacting to the latest show on Twitter, viewer Richard Foster said: ‘Not so much happy valley as brutal, violent, drug-ridden, death valley!’ Francois Garcia added: ‘Happy Valley on BBC is far from happy, more incredibly violent. Is this a real reflection of Yorkshire life? God help us if it is.’ Zoe Smith said: ‘Still shaking from the stress of it all. Gruesome, gripping, great TV.’ A fourth, using the name Loopy Lobes on . the BBC’s Points of View online message board, said: ‘A cracking . programme, but I have to confess that I wouldn’t have started watching . if I’d known there’d be so much violence, not my thing at all, but it . had me jumping out of my seat urging the women on.’ Rescued: Cawood is pulled out on to the street following the beating in Tuesday's episode of Happy Valley . Collapse: As the show ended, Cawood collapsed in the road (pictured), her face and hands covered in blood . The BBC said it had received 15 complaints about the episode, which aired between 9pm and 10pm after the watershed, while 45 viewers contacted the corporation to say how much they enjoyed the show. Broadcasting regulator Ofcom received one complaint. However, Vivienne Pattison of Mediawatch-UK, which campaigns for stronger regulation, said: ‘This is part of a worrying trend in TV drama. Over the last couple of years, we have seen more and more shows depicting gratuitous  violence, often against women. 'The hit series Game of Thrones has really upped the ante, and we saw it in BBC shows like Peaky Blinders and Line of Duty. Uncertain fate: The end of the episode left viewers guessing whether Cawood had died . ‘This kind of graphic violence dehumanises us all, and studies have shown that watching it can stunt your emotional growth.’ Happy Valley is written by Sally Wainwright, creator of last year’s hit Last Tango in Halifax. The drama also starred Miss Lancashire and earned her a Bafta on Sunday for best supporting actress. In Happy Valley, the 49-year-old plays a police sergeant in a small, drug-riddled town in Yorkshire, who investigates a kidnapping plot. The show’s title was inspired by a nickname police gave Hebden Bridge, Yorkshire, after it became known for cannabis cultivation. Miss Wainwright has said: ‘Like a lot of people, I guess I thought those kind of things just didn’t happen in a place like Hebden Bridge, but of course they do. ‘I’m not saying it’s worse than anywhere else, but everywhere – even market towns with lovely cafes and restaurants – has a dark side.’ A BBC spokesman said: ‘It was broadcast in a post-watershed slot and was clearly signposted with an on-air announcement before the episode started.’","In Tuesday's episode, character Catherine Cawood was savagely beaten .

"HMRC was accused yesterday of taking ‘a smash and grab’ approach with its demand for new powers to seize money directly from people’s bank accounts. Britain’s leading tax experts warned the taxman risks being ‘unconstitutional’ with the controversial plans, which could come into force within months. The proposed new powers - which were published in the Budget and subject to a public consultation which closed yesterday - have triggered an outcry among tax experts. HM Revenue and Customs has been accused of taking a 'smash and grab' approach with its demand for new powers to seize money directly from people’s bank accounts . If HMRC believes anyone owes money to them, they will be able to take the cash directly from current accounts, joint accounts or tax-free Isas to settle an unpaid tax bill. Around 17,000 people a year will have money seized under the proposed new powers, known as the ‘direct recovery of debts’. Each will typically owe £5,800. To be targeted, somone must owe at least £1,000 to the tax man – and must have at least £5,000 left across their accounts after the money for their tax debt has been removed. In its response, the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales said it has ‘no sympathy’ for those who do not pay the tax they owe despite having the means to do so. But it added: ‘Under UK law, if someone owes you money, you cannot just help yourself to it. Permission of the court is required. ‘For these reasons, the proposed new powers are unconstitutional and wrong in principle. Independent, judicial oversight is essential for any such recovery power.’ If it is granted the new powers, HMRC will not need to apply to a court in order to grab money directly from people’s accounts. Chas Roy-Chowdhury, head of taxation at the Association of Chartered Certified Accountants, said: ‘These new powers are knocking at the door of being unconstitutional. Chas Roy-Chowdhury (pictured), head of taxation at the Association of Chartered Certified Accountants, has said the new powers are 'knocking at the door of being unconstitutional' ‘It will mean HMRC can take a ‘smash and grab’ approach by delving into someone’ s back account at will and taking their money.’ The ICAEW’s response also raised concerns that HMRC will ‘inevitably make errors’ which could have ‘very damaging consequences’. Official documents reveal it expects to get £375million between 2015 and 2019, but the ICAEW said this amount is small when it is compared to the potential loss of trust among the public. It warned: ‘The publicity given to any case where DRD is used inappropriately would have a damaging effect on public confidence in the tax system. ‘In the UK, voluntary compliance and trust in the tax system in the tax system are crucial to the way the system operates. The cost of trust being eroded will far outweigh the sums DRD is expected to yield.’ Patrick Stevens, of the Chartered Institute of Taxation, said he is fearful of the vulnerable people who will be targeted by the new powers, such as the elderly and the sick. While HMRC says it will have contacted a person at least nine times before removing their money, Mr Stevens said: ‘That is not going to be make a difference if you never got the letters [because you are abroad] or do not understand why you are receiving it.’ The Forum of Private Business, the business lobby group, also yesterday urged the government to scrap the plans. Alexander Jackman, the forum’s head of policy, said it ‘unequivocally condemns tax avoidance and tax evasion’, but fears the proposed new powers will ‘unfairly target’ small firms. During a recent grilling by MPs on the Treasury Select Committee, Lin Homer, chief executive of HMRC, said the people who will be targeted by the new money-grabbing powers can afford to pay their tax, but simply refuse to pay it. She said they are ‘gaming the system’. Mrs Homer said: ‘They don’t dispute that the tax is due. They just won’t pay. They just fold their arms and wait for us to take some other action.’","Experts say taxman risks being 'unconstitutional' with planned new powers .

"Four million pounds in bonuses have been paid to the directors of water firms – despite their failure to repair leaks which allow 300million gallons to be lost every day. All but one of the companies, which today brought in hosepipe bans for 20million customers, handed rewards to their board members in the last financial year. These include £2million for three executives at Britain's largest water supplier Thames Water, whose highest paid director, understood to be chief executive Martin Baggs, took home £1.67million in 2010/11. Parched: Cracked and dried mud below a bridge crossing the dry River Kennet in the village of Lockeridge, near Marlborough this week . Britain's water companies have to failed repair leaks which allow 300million gallons to be lost every day . More than £1million was paid out by Anglian Water and more than £400,000 by Southern Water, even though both failed to meet their leakage targets last year. The daily loss of 300million gallons –  enough to service the needs of 11million consumers – has made a big contribution to the water shortage. The Mail can also reveal that an astonishing £500million was paid to the water companies' mainly foreign shareholders for the six months to September 2011 – when drought was already blighting the East of England. Critics say this money could have been better spent fixing Britain's fragile pipe network. Almost £300million was paid to investors in Anglian Water, owned by a Canadian and Australian-led consortium, £179.5million by Thames Water, which is majority owned by Australian bank Macquarie, and £16million by South East Water owned by a Canadian company. Sutton and East Surrey Water, owned by Deutsche Bank, paid out £2.65million to shareholders. Veolia and Southern Water did not pay dividends in that period. Poster being issued by Britain's biggest water company Thames Water on drought conditions . The payouts will infuriate customers who are banned from using hosepipes for gardening, cleaning or paddling pools from today by seven firms – the most extensive ban since the drought of 1976. Companies have blamed the restrictions on chronically low rainfall for the past two years. Anyone caught breaching the ban faces a £1,000 fine. Labour's water spokesman Gavin Shuker said: 'On the day millions are made the subject of a hosepipe ban, in the week of inflation-busting price rises, customers will find these bonus payments hard to swallow.' Both David Cameron and Business Secretary Vince Cable have recently spoken out about bonuses. Mr Cameron said 'everybody' had to do a better job at 'explaining how pay is linked to performance.' Bonuses and shareholder dividends for the financial year 2011/12 which ends this week, will be announced by water companies in June. Their profits have soared since privatisation in 1989 as a string of financial  conglomerates have bought and sold the utilities in quick succession. Anglian Water – which serves 5million customers in one of the worst-hit drought areas – announced profits of £709million last year. This was around double the 2008 figure. Thames was bought by the Australian firm Kemble Water after a disastrous few years under German firm RWE which bought the company for £4.8billion in 2000, and sold it for around £8billion six years later. Water companies have stressed that an hour using a hosepipe wastes the same amount of water a family of four uses in a week, and that savings now will prevent further restrictions later in the year. A Thames Water spokesman said half of £1.98million bonuses were incentive plans from previous years only paid if the directors meet tough financial targets. He added the company invests £1billion a year in improving pipes, sewers and other facilities. Anglian has not banned hosepipes for 20 years. South East Water said it had to pay a reasonable return to investors who had helped fund improvements to its water supply infrastructure. Restrictions are likely to last all summer, even if there is rain in the affected areas. Winter rainfall, as low as 40 per cent of the average in some areas, has left reservoirs and rivers low. Nick Ellins, of industry body Water UK, said: 'Water companies are required to meet their customers' needs and statutory obligations efficiently, within price limits set by a regulator. 'They also have to ensure that they win their investors' confidence, by delivering a fair return on the investments made.'","Three executives at Thames Water, Britain's biggest water supplier, were handed £2m in bonuses .

"Shopping for clothes used to be so simple. You would stroll into a shop, pick up a few items, try them on in a changing room and then take them to the till if they looked alright on. Now some chains are doing things a little differently. Abercrombie & Fitch and its offshoot, Hollister, sell their clothes targeted at 14-18 year olds in the dark. Well almost. The low lighting aims to give the shops a . casino or VIP club-like feel, bathing their teenage customers in . luxury. But parents are less impressed, complaining of bumping into . tables, not being able to see colours or prices and - in at least one . case - losing a child in the dark. What do teenagers see in the brand? Abercrombie & Fitch workers - including the topless models who stand by the door - in the poorly-lit flagship store . It is not just the lighting that disappoints. The ear-splittingly loud music helps add to the exclusive atmosphere, and the clothes are even sprayed with an intoxicating scent that lingers long after you have left the store. And there's also the unusual experience of walking past a couple of models in swimsuits on your way into the shop - whatever the weather. Teenagers queue up to get their photos taken with the six-packed sales assistants while everyone else cringes. Fortunately, the darkness spares some of everyone's blushes. Linda Watson, 51, from Sutton Coldfield lost her daughter in the shop. She said: 'I went to look somewhere else and I just couldn't find her when I turned around because it's so dark. I had to come out and phone her.' Another mother, Linda Peach, added: 'When we go in I cling to my daughters and say, ""don't lose me"".' Welder Nick Bull, 30, from Birmingham, . said of Hollister in the Bullring shopping centre: 'I can't see the sizes, I can't see . the prices, I can't see the till - I can't see the point.' Dark and mysterious: The Hollister store in Birmingham's Bullring shopping centre . Hollister customer Linda Peach said: 'When we go in I cling to my daughters and say, ""don't lose me""' Are YOU intimidated by clothes shops your teens love? Are YOU intimidated by clothes shops your teens love? Now share your opinion . The sales strategy has sparked Facebook groups including 'Turn up the lights and turn down the music Abercrombie!,' and 'Welcome to Hollister, would you like a torch?' Teenager Lauren Playfoot wrote on one of the group's message boards: 'My mate bought a pink checked top, turns out to be orange.' George Warrington added: 'The thing is if Hollister can't afford lights, where does the hundred quid I spend every time i go in go?' A spokesperson for Hollister refused to comment on the issue.  But one worker said: 'It creates an atmosphere that allows you to come in and hang out while finding some cool clothes. 'It gives a type of casino-feel,where people can get lost in a club-like environment, people relax, and hopefully spend more.' It's clearly working: Hollister opened its first British store in 2008. It now has 22 UK outlets, with more to come, much to the delight off its teenage fans . Darkness is part of the brand: Wallis Stewart wrote on Facebook, 'I don't think I'd want them to fix the lights 'cause with different lights it just wouldn't be Hollister!' Matt Helbig, who worked for the company for three years commented: 'Stores such as Abercrombie & Fitch . and Hollister, both owned by the Abercrombie & Fitch Company, focus a . lot on providing a certain atmosphere to the customer. 'By having low . lights, a signature fragrance spritzed on the clothes, and maybe louder . music than most stores, A&F sets itself apart from other clothing . stores.' Loud music and strong smells just add to that exclusive-feeling experience. The perfume, in particular reminds customers of the shop long after they have gone elsewhere. The tactic was pushed to new limits in Ginza, Tokyo. When a new Abercrombie & Fitch flagship store opened there, even the streets were sprayed with the scent. And it all seems to be working. Hollister opened its first British store in 2008. It now has 22 UK outlets, with more to come. There is often a queue outside its stores helping to make the clothes even more desirable. And darkness has already become part of the brand. As Wallis Stewart comments on Facebook: 'I don't think I'd want them to . fix the lights 'cause with different lights it just wouldn't be Hollister!",Lighting in Abercrombie & Fitch and Hollister stores so dim shoppers have been bumping into things .

"Los Angeles Clippers guard Chris Paul has been fined $25,000 for criticizing a female official after a loss at Cleveland. The NBA announced the fine on Saturday. Paul was given a technical by rookie referee Lauren Holtkamp on Thursday night in the third quarter of a 105-94 loss to the Cavaliers, a game that featured five technicals against the Clippers. After the game, Paul called the technical on an inbounds play 'ridiculous' and said 'this might not be for her.' Holtkamp is one of only two female officials in the NBA. Paying: LA Clippers guard Chris Paul (left) has been fined $25,000 by the league for criticizing female referee Lauren Holtkamp (right) during the team's loss against Cleveland last week . Ouch: After the game, Paul (left) commented about the call and said that referring 'might not be for her' - referring to Holtkamp (right) Paul appeared to say something to her as he waited for an inbound pass after a Cavaliers' free throw. Paul said Friday that he was only upset with the call. The penalty is in line with others the NBA has levied for criticism of officials. Paul got his technical with 10 minutes 17 seconds left in the third. Following a free throw by Cleveland, the Clippers were attempting to inbound the ball quickly when Holtkamp stepped in. After the game Paul said: 'The tech I got was ridiculous. That's terrible. There's no way that can be a technical. We try to get the ball out fast every time down the court. Fight: The foul in question happened in the third quarter, when the Clippers were trying to rebound a free throw.

'When we did that, she said, 'Uh-uh'' I said, 'Why uh-uh?' and she gave me a technical. That's ridiculous. If that's the case, this might not be for her.' Clippers coach Doc Rivers also received a technical and forward Matt Barnes was ejected in the third by Lewis after getting his second 'T.'

"A baby born prematurely in New York leaving his parents fearing a £130,000 medical bill has flown home in style after the couple's insurance company and private donations covered the costs of his early arrival. Dax Lee Johnston spent seven weeks in the city after his unexpected arrival weighing just 3lbs while his parents were enjoying a four-day getaway after Christmas. Katie Amos and fiancé Lee Johnston, both 30, welcomed Dax on December 28 after she went into labour 11 weeks early while sightseeing in the Big Apple. Scroll down for video . Baby Dax, born prematurely in New York leaving his parents fearing a £130,000 medical bill, has flown home . Parents Katie Amos and Lee Johnston, both 30, flew Dax home from New York in his own private medical jet . The little boy needed his own passport and to be well enough to make the journey before he could be given the all-clear to fly home in his very own private medical jet. His mother described his journey home to the UK yesterday as like a 'military operation'. Miss Amos, from Burgh-le-Marsh in Lincolnshire, said: 'When we were finally given the all-clear to come home I broke down in tears, we were so happy, no words could describe it. 'What had been a very slow process, all of a sudden changed and everything happened really quickly. 'It was like all of our New Years wishes had come true all at once. 'We were originally told that Dax wouldn't be well enough to make the journey home until earliest March 10, which was his original due date.' Miss Amos and son Dax (above), who was born weighing 3lbs, and told he wouldn't be able to fly until March . Katie Amos, 30, and fiancé Lee Johnston, 29, from Burgh-le-Marsh, Lincolnshire, welcomed son Dax (together above) unexpectedly . She added: 'As Dax was premature he wasn't allowed to fly on a commercial airline, the only reason we are home now is because we had a specially equipped aircraft and Dax had his own incubator.' Dax was given the all-clear to travel from Lenox Hill Hospital in New York on Thursday. His parents were told Pilgrim Hospital, in Lincolnshire, had space for Dax - but Miss Amos added they had a 24-hour window to get him home in case other patients were booked in. She said: 'On Friday evening we were transferred to the airport with Dax in the incubator. 'We had our own private plane with just us, the pilots, a team of doctors and nurses - it was like a military operation. 'We had to stop off to re-fuel twice in America before flying over the Atlantic and making a final stop in Iceland. 'We have been on such an emotional journey and it's so amazing to be back in the UK with all our friends and family.' Dax, who was born 11 weeks early while his parents were on a four-day break in the Big Apple, was kept in an incubator during the flight . A team of doctors, nurses and pilots helped the Johnstons fly to Lincolnshire in a 'military-style operation' Miss Amos and Mr Johnston were stunned when their son arrived almost three months early while they enjoyed a last-minute holiday. She said: 'We had been trying to cram as much in as we could in our four day trip. 'We were on the Central Park movie tour when I started getting sharp pains, I knew something was wrong, but I kept dismissing it. 'I don't know how but we managed to finish the tour, I just knew I needed to rest, but when we made it back to the hotel we phoned a doctor who told us to get to a hospital straight away. 'I was examined and nearly passed out when the nurses told me I was four centimeters dilated and Dax was on his way.' Miss Amos added: 'We have cried, laughed and felt everything in between, it's been a really tough journey and we are over the moon that it's finally over. It had been feared the baby wouldn't be given the all-clear to fly until March 10 - his original due date . Dax, pictured in Pilgrim Hospital, weighed just 3lbs when he unexpectedly arrived in December last year . 'When we finally received Dax's American passport it was a huge milestone, we could finally see the light at the end of the tunnel. 'To get a UK passport it could've taken up to three months and we wanted to get him home as soon as we could, so Dax has a US passport and birth certificate. 'Just to get the photo we had to remove all of his vital tubes that helped him breathe and feed - it was really scary. 'Being born so prematurely Dax has had a few health scares but he's doing really well now.' She added: 'He has reflux which is common for premature babies as his little body had so much to contend with. 'He's still being closely monitored as he suffers from Patent Ductus Arteriosus (PDA) which means one of the main arteries from his heart isn't closed properly. 'It's looking positive though as doctors say this should close on it's own. 'Dax has been incredible throughout, he's our little fighter and we are so proud of him already.' And after giving birth, the couple were shocked to discover they could be left with a £130,000 medical bill - but now their insurers, Allianz, have confirmed they will cover all costs. 'When we arrived at the hospital, one of the nurses asked Lee to sort out our medical insurance,' Miss Amos added. Little Dax is now staying at Pilgrim Hospital in Boston, Lincolnshire, after flying home with a US passport . Daz is still being closely monitored as he suffers from Patent Ductus Arteriosus (PDA) which means one of the main arteries from his heart is not closed properly . 'When he came back he was grey in the face - the woman he had spoken to said she wouldn't accept our insurance, it was so scary. 'The prices were sky high. We were horrified when we started adding up the cost of everything which would've amounted to around £130,000. 'What made it worse was it was the holidays so everywhere was closed, we thought for nearly a week that we would be left to pay this on our own.' The couple, who are both fitness instructors, travelled to New York on Boxing Day for a last-minute holiday before the birth of their baby. But two days into the trip, Miss Amos went into labour and Dax was born. Mr Johnston said: 'The timing wasn't the best, but I guess Dax couldn't wait any longer. 'We couldn't be more thankful to our family and friends who have kept us strong even when we have been miles apart.' And now the couple's financial worries are now over - thanks to their insurance company and donations. Mr Johnston added: 'We want to express our gratitude to Allianz for their tremendous help, as well as all the kind strangers who have donated nearly £12,000 to help my family. 'Without this money I don't know what we would've done. It went towards living costs as we had only taken four days worth of clothes, plus food and all of the vital things Dax needed.' He added all donations on Dax's fundraising page are now going to Ronald McDonald House. Mr Johnston said: 'The organisation provides vital help and cheaper accommodation for families, just like myself and Katie whose children are in hospital.' He added: 'The final step of the journey for Dax will be to get big enough and well enough to return to his own home.' Miss Amos said: 'So many people have pulled together to help us get our little boy home - we will never forget it. 'The next step of our new life with Dax can finally begin, we couldn't be more happy.' Dax flew home from Lennox Hill hospital in New York after doctors gave him the all-clear to fly on Thursday .

"It is the bane of many an enthusiastic foodie's life - the lingering smell and teary process of chopping onions. But supermarket giant Asda might have found the solution. The chain has unveiled what it describes as the UK's first sweet red onion, promising to rid shoppers of tears and bad breath after eating. Asda has unveiled what it describes as the UK's first sweet red onion, promising to rid shoppers of tears and bad breath after eating . The Asda Sweet Red has 'lower pungency levels', meaning the flavour is less overpowering, fewer tears are shed when chopping and the odour will not linger on the breath as long as a regular onion. The new bulb is said to boast a milder, juicier and crunchier flavour and texture than regular red onions. In an initiative spanning more than 20 years, farmer Alastair Findlay of Bedfordshire Growers personally tasted and evaluated some 400 to 500 bulbs per season to cultivate the new product. More than 40 tonnes of Sweet Reds are hitting selected Asda stores this weekend priced at £1. The new bulb is said to boast a milder, juicier and crunchier flavour and texture than regular red onions . Andy Wareham, vegetable buyer at Asda, said: 'We're incredibly proud to have worked and supported Alastair on his journey. 'Introducing the UK's very first sweet red onion is a fantastic achievement and like the USA, the UK has a sweeter palate than most so will appreciate the same tangy flavour, without the strong acidity of some onions. 'It's funny to think that prior to the 1990s, there were no red onions grown within the UK, however, due to the popularity and versatility of the variety, they now account for 20% of the total onions sold within the UK.'","Asda has unveiled what it describes as the UK's first sweet red onion .

"A terminally ill woman whose desire to have her same-sex marriage recognized by Indiana before she died helped galvanize efforts to overturn the state's gay marriage ban has lost her battle with cancer. Niki Quasney died on Thursday, gay rights advocacy group Lambda Legal said on Sunday. She was 38. Quasney and Amy Sandler challenged Indiana's ban on same-sex marriage as Quasney neared the end of a years-long battle with ovarian cancer. Scroll down for video . Niki Quasney, left, who together with her wife Amy Sandler, right, helped galvanize efforts to overturn Indiana's gay marriage ban lost her years-long battle with cancer on Thursday . The couple from Munster, which is in northwest Indiana and just south of Chicago, obtained a civil union in Illinois in 2011 and married in Massachusetts in 2013, and they wanted Sandler listed as Quasney's spouse on her Indiana death certificate to ensure that Sandler and the couple's two young children received the death benefits to which married couples are entitled. At the time, Indiana didn't allow same-sex marriage and refused to recognize such marriages obtained elsewhere. A federal judge in April granted the couple's emergency request to have their marriage recognized. Judge Richard Young ruled in June that the state's gay marriage ban was unconstitutional, sending hundreds of same-sex couples across the state to county clerks' offices for impromptu weddings. The state appealed Young's ruling, and the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals granted a stay that put each of those marriages in limbo. But Quasney and Sandler's union was still recognized, and for a time they remained the only legally married same-sex couple in the state. Video courtesy of Front Row Foundation . Quasney had fought to have her marriage recognized to ensure that Sandler and the couple's two young children would receive the death benefits to which married couples are entitled . The 7th Circuit in September issued a scathing, unanimous ruling overturning the gay marriage bans in Indiana and Wisconsin. Paul Castillo, an attorney for Lambda Legal, which represented the couple, said Quasney and Sandler made history as they fought for equality, noting that the urgency of their case accelerated a 7th Circuit hearing on a challenge to Wisconsin's gay marriage challenge as well. 'Niki and Amy and their daughters became Indiana's first family when they bravely joined Lambda Legal's marriage case, which meant openly sharing very personal and painful parts of their journey together as Niki battled cancer,' he said. 'They brought this case and fought so hard because they loved each other and wanted their daughters to be treated with respect, just like any other family in Indiana.' He said the couple 'never wanted to be alone in recognition of their family.'","Niki Quasney, 38, lost her years-long battle with ovarian cancer on Thursday .

"A teenager has died and another is on life support after they collapsed following drug overdoses at a dance festival in Sydney at the weekend. The 19-year-old man collapsed on the dance floor after taking ecstasy on Saturday night at the A State Of Trance dance festival at Sydney Olympic Park. Medical staff tried to treat the teenager at the event, but he was rushed to hospital in a critical condition and later died.

"These days, the backdrop is usually a star-studded red carpet. But during his teenage years, Eddie Redmayne tended to be pictured in an even more exclusive setting. The 33-year-old actor, man-of-the-moment at last night’s Bafta awards, posed in a number of fascinating photographs during his time at Eton, including several with his contemporary, Prince William. One shows Redmayne starring in a house play, Pravda; another sees him standing on the steps of the College chapel as fellow choristers lark about behind him; a third depicts him posing with William and fellow members of an under-16 rugby side. Scroll down for video . A strong back row: Eddie Redmayne and Prince William (both circled) were stalwarts of the same rugby team at Eton in 1997 . Praiseworthy: A young Eddie Redmayne keeps a straight face as fellow choristers cavort behind him . ‘We were on the same Colts B team in 1997,’ Redmayne has recalled. ‘I always felt slightly sorry for Will because everyone wanted to tackle the future King of England. He took all the hits. ‘I’m pretty sure Will was more intimidating than I was. I don’t think I intimidated anyone in my life. I haven’t seen him since school, but he was a lovely man.’ Perhaps the image Redmayne is proudest of dates back to 2000, when he and the Prince achieved a signal honour: they were elected to The Eton Society, a body known as ‘Pop’, which contains roughly 20 of the most popular final year students. The elite group, the equivalent of prefects, are selected by their peers, and have a string of duties, including organising tours of the £35,000-a-year boarding school for prospective parents. In return, they are allowed to wear brightly coloured waistcoats, which you can see being proudly displayed in the photograph below — with its swaggering echoes of those famous shots of Oxford University’s Bullingdon Club. Sartorial elite: The 17-year-old William lounges against the wall in a tiger-striped waistcoat while fellow prefect Eddie, next to him, appears to be taking it all very seriously . We know all about Redmayne’s successes, but what became of the other members of this ultra-exclusive club? 1. George Broke . He is noted in West London’s posher party circles for his devotion to fancy dress, but he comes from the most blue-chip of backgrounds: his father, also George, was Equerry to the Queen. After gaining a 2:1 degree in anthropology from Durham, he took a job with accountancy firm Grant Thornton, but now works as business development manager to the Priory Group, which runs the £2,500-a-week celebrity rehab clinics. 2.

He later won a Rhodes scholarship to Oxford, before going into the law, working first for Linklaters in London and Singapore, and more recently for the U.S. firm Logan Circle Partners. 8. Alexander True . Went to Bristol University, before going into the City to seek his fortune. After a few years as an investment consultant with Credit Suisse, he moved to Newton Investment Management, and is currently an investment manager at Sarasin & Partners, a London asset management firm. 9. Harry Aubrey Fletcher . The son of Sir Henry Aubrey Fletcher, Lord Lieutenant of Buckinghamshire, Harry was one of Prince William’s closest school friends, and they remain close. His 2011 marriage to Louise Stourton (a cousin of No 13 Ivo Stourton) was attended by Prince William and Kate (Wills was an usher). Later, Harry was photographed tweaking the Prince’s ear, in a private box at Cheltenham races. Last March, William and Kate went to Louise’s raucous birthday party at Bunga Bunga, a karaoke bar and restaurant in London where diners are entertained by Elvis impersonators and drag queens. Prince William is still friends with Harry Aubrey Fletcher, who is pictured tweaking the future monarch's ear as the Duchess of Cambridge giggles in the background . 10. Jamie Wrightson .

Now lives in Putney, works at JP Morgan bank and has two small children. 17. Hamish Barne . A former soldier, Hamish spent nine years in the Scots Guards, serving in Iraq and Afghanistan. He was also an adjutant at Trooping the Colour in 2011, and for a time worked as Equerry to the Duke of Kent. He left the Army in 2013, and spent two months of last year driving from London to Cape Town in a truck, to raise money for charity. 18. Matt Lowe . The President of ‘Pop’, who won a music scholarship to the school, he is now a professional cellist, who played for the BBC Symphony Orchestra at the opening night of the Proms last year (they performed Elgar’s The Kingdom).

"Police believe they have identified a man's body dumped in pieces in a Melbourne river after a family member recognised a distinctive tattoo. DNA tests will be used to confirm the identity of the victim, who police say may be a man in his late 30s who lived on the fringe of the Melbourne CBD. It comes after severed arm with a red devil tattoo was spotted in the Maribyrnong River near the Boathouse restaurant on Thursday, while other remains were found further upstream. Divers are still scouring the river after more body parts were discovered by a member of the public, who found two severed limbs and a plastic bag of flesh at about 11am on Saturday. Homicide Squad Detective Inspector Mick Hughes said a close relative of the suspected victim came forward after police released images of a red devil tattoo found on the forearm. Scroll down for video . Police released the image after a forearm - severed at the elbow and wrist - was spotted floating in the Maribyrnong River in Melbourne by diners at a nearby restaurant on Thursday afternoon . 'It's a tragic way for the family to find out but it has progressed our investigation,' Det Insp Hughes said. Police won't release the name of the victim until he is formally identified through DNA testing, which is expected to take several days. 'We will release it as soon as we are able because clearly again we want to know his associates and how they may be able to help us,' Det Insp Hughes said. It's believed the man was not known to police. He had not been in contact with his family since Christmas but police say that was not unusual and he was not listed as a missing person. It comes as severed arm with a devil tattoo was spotted in the Maribyrnong River in Melbourne on Thursday . Det Insp Hughes said the tidal nature of the river made the search for body parts difficult. He said police were still expecting to find more body parts and any member of the public who come across them should contact officers. 'We've done the best we can on the ground and we'll continue to do that,' he said. 'Certainly if someone sees something we'll have a team respond.' The first body parts were discovered by a runner, while a rower discovered more on Sunday. Det Insp Hughes confirmed some of the body parts had been found in plastic but said appeared they had not been weighed down. Investigations into the man's associates will begin once he has been formally identified. Detectives continued searching the river by boat on Friday morning and will focus on a bridge about two kilometres from the restaurant where the forearm was spotted .

"Paedophile rock star Ian Watkins has been moved to a lower security 'soft prison' - where he is surrounded by other sex offenders . Paedophile rock star Ian Watkins has been moved to a lower security 'soft prison' - where he is surrounded by other sex offenders. The Lostprophets front man, who was jailed for 29 years after admitting the attempted rape of a baby and the sexual assault of a child under 13, was moved from Category A prison HMP Long Lartin to the lower security Category B prison HMP Rye Hill to carry on his sentence. The prison move has caused outrage among child safety campaigners who say Watkins has been placed in a 'haven for paedophiles'. A petition calling on Justice Secretary Chris Grayling to reverse the prison move has been launched by Watkins' former lover Joanne Mjadzelics - who repeatedly reported the singer to police and social services for four years before his arrest. Ms Mjadzelics said: 'Ian Watkins is meant to be serving a 29 year sentence in a real prison - not a haven for paedophiles. 'I know how evil this man is and people like him will never change and need to be punished severely. 'He and they need to be out of their comfort zone of swapping sick stories with other paedophiles and in a real prison to serve their time. 'If not then where is the punishment for them and justice for the many children and families these evil predators have destroyed? 'You may as well have put them up in an Ibis hotel having a constant paedophile convention.' She was arrested last year for possession of indecent images of children that Watkins had sent her over the internet but cleared by a jury after a week-long trial. The court heard she had repeatedly tried to show the images to police and report his paedophile activities for four years before Watkins was arrested. Watkins was jailed in December 2013 for 29 years after admitting the attempted rape of a baby and the sexual assault of a child under 13. He also admitted conspiring to rape a child, three counts of sexual assault involving children, seven involving taking, making or possessing indecent images of children and one of possessing an extreme pornographic image involving a sex act on an animal. The Lostprophets front man, who was jailed for 29 years after admitting the attempted rape of a baby and the sexual assault of a child under 13, was moved from Category A prison HMP Long Lartin . He has been moved to the lower security Category B prison HMP Rye Hill to carry on his sentence.The prison move has caused outrage among child safety campaigners who say Watkins has been placed in a 'haven for paedophiles' Watkins was sentenced alongside the two women who were the mothers of the children he abused, known only as Woman A and Woman B. They were jailed for 14 and 17 years respectively. He was originally sent to the Category A prison HMP Wakefield in Yorkshire - dubbed 'Monster Mansion' because it houses some of the most heinous murderers in the UK including April Jones' paedophile killer Mark Bridger. Watkins was then moved to fellow Category A prison HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire which houses Soham child killer Ian Huntley, before his latest move to the less secure Category B prison HMP Rye Hill - run by private security firm G4S. The Ministry of Justice has refused to confirm or deny the prison move but said they were determined to have 'one of the toughest regimes in the world for managing sex offenders'. An MoJ spokeswoman said: 'On the basis of the available evidence the current strategy is to concentrate sex offenders together. 'By doing this, we aim to place sex offenders in prisons that offer specialist assessment and interventions and take account of research findings that indicate that on balance, sex offenders are more able to concentrate on rehabilitation if co-located away from a non sex offender population. 'The available research that has directly examined the ethos of sex offenders units has consistently shown that prisoners are discouraged from discussing their offences with each other. A petition calling on Justice Secretary Chris Grayling to reverse the prison move has been launched by Watkins' former lover Joanne Mjadzelics - who repeatedly reported the singer to police and social services for four years before his arrest . 'This does not mean that the risk of networking is ignored, and systems are in place to monitor and address this as necessary. 'Apart from the provision of specialist interventions and services, and the expertise and experience of the staff group, there is no particular difference in the regime and facilities available to prisoners with a predominantly sex offender population from other prisons.' Eight jails in England and Wales now house only sex offenders as the number of abusers has rocketed to more than 11,000. Jon Bird, operations manager at The National Association for People Abused in Childhood, said: 'It is disturbing that there are serious sex offenders who are able to mix with their own kind. 'We have to recognise there are people in society who have these urges and they have to be treated and one day they are going to be released. 'But by letting them mix solely with people like themselves that does not seem like it will help. 'From the point of view of the survivors who were affected by these horrific crimes it sends out the wrong message. 'We should be punishing these criminals and not letting them swap sick stories, if not other materials. 'We know that on sex offender wings in Category B prisons in the past there have been child abuse videos found along with other contraband such as drugs.' Mr Bird said there was a 'real concern' about whether Ian Watkins is co-operating fully with his sex offenders treatment and admits to the seriousness of his crimes. He said: 'We haven't seen anything to say he is and he has been appealing against his sentencing. He needs to recognise what he did was wrong.'","Lostprophets singer was moved from Category A prison HMP Long Lartin to the lower security Category B prison HMP Rye Hill, in Warwickshire .

"A 74-room mansion used by Napoleon Bonaparte as his headquarters during a famous battle has been put up for sale. Villa La Voglina in Piedmont, Italy, was built in the 18th century by the world-renowned Baroque architect Filippo Juvarra. The historic property is set in 60 acres and boasts 13 bedrooms, nine bathrooms and a private chapel with seating for 30 people. It is on the market at £3.8million with Beauchamp Estates, which also has a two-bedroom flat for sale at a similar price in London’s Belgravia. Scroll down for video . Beautiful property: Villa La Voglina in Piedmont, Italy, was built in the 18th Century by the world renowned Baroque architect Filippo Juvarra . Stunning interior: The property is set in 60 acres and boasts 13 bedrooms, nine bathrooms and a private chapel with seating for 30 people . Fine dining: Some 215 years ago, the French emperor Napoloeon used Villa La Voglina as his headquarters for the Battle of Marengo . One of more than a dozen bedrooms: The property also has two dining rooms, two kitchens, ten reception rooms and a guest house . Some 215 years ago, the French emperor used Villa La Voglina as his headquarters for the Battle of Marengo. The fighting between the French and Austrians took place near the city of Alessandria in Piemonte on June 14, 1800. Napoleon’s French forces overcame General Michael von Melas’s surprise attack near the end of the day, driving the Austrians out of Italy. As a 'thank you' to the French ancestors of the current owner, Napoleon ordered the captured Austrian troops to build the current terrace. In the shade: The property in in Piedmont, Italy, has beautiful formal gardens and terraces along with a vineyard . Hallway and private chapel: The owners have now put the villa and its grounds on the market with Mayfair estate agents Beauchamp Estates . Praise: Villa La Voglina is said by estate agents to be 'a wonderful classic Italian Baroque villa, architecturally and historically significant' The Battle of Marengo was one of Napoleon’s greatest military victories. The Frenchman was at the height of his military powers, and drove Austrian forces out of Italy. It was fought on the Marengo Plain - about three miles from Alessandria - between 28,000 French troops and 31,000 Austrians led by General Michael Friedrich von Melas. It brought about the French occupation of the Lombardy region up to the Mincio River. At first, the Austrians attacked at Alessandria while the French were separated - leading General Melas to believe he had won. But after the French were pushed back, Napoleon gathered his extra troops from Turin - and forced the Austrians into a retreat. They also laid traditional Habsburg black and white diagonal tiles in all three entrance halls and created three black and white marble staircases. The property also has two dining rooms, two kitchens, ten reception rooms and a guest house. There are beautiful formal gardens and terraces along with a vineyard which, if restored, could produce around 100,000 bottles of wine per year. The owners have now put the villa and its grounds on the market with Beauchamp Estates. Gary Hersham, of Beauchamp Estates, said: ‘Villa La Voglina is a wonderful classic Italian Baroque villa, architecturally and historically significant as an example of Juvarra’s work and of a stature that does not often come to the market. ‘With a sizeable parcel of land, it would make a truly stunning and tranquil private retreat. ‘Located as it is in one of Italy’s most celebrated culinary and wine producing regions, reinstatement of the vineyards would be in-keeping with the region and the property’s history, in addition to assisting with the running of the estate. ‘The region attracts a great many visitors, both domestic and international, many of who are drawn to the area for its culinary and viticulture reputation. ‘This ever increasing appeal means that the property will also be of interest to those wishing to develop commercial activity, both small independent operators and those of scale.’ Luxury dwelling: The estate agents say the property and its grounds 'would make a truly stunning and tranquil private retreat' Out and in: Captured Austrian troops created three black and white marble staircases (right), which grace the central property today .

Lynne Davie, of Beauchamp Estates Florence, added: ‘We are excited to be marketing such a wonderful estate and magnificent villa. ‘Villa La Voglina is so ideally located, benefitting from the beautiful Piemonte region while at the same time affording excellent communication links, across Europe and internationally.’ The flat marketed by Beauchamp at a similar price in Belgravia – that of £3.6million - is billed as a being ‘luxurious and stylish apartment’, with one bedroom and one master bedroom. The estate agent's description says the home on exclusive Eaton Square is ‘newly refurbished with interiors finished to a very high standard’.","Villa La Voglina in Piedmont, Italy, was built in 18th century by world-renowned Baroque architect Filippo Juvarra .

"Round my way a cadger was someone who liked to beg or borrow something from you. But French giant Renault is hoping its 'Kadjar', a new crossover vehicle, pictured, will steal customers away from mighty Nissan's top-selling Qashqai. With its rugged, chunky styling and aerodynamic lines, it's the bigger sibling of the existing Captur. It'll go on sale in the summer on the continent, but British buyers will have to wait til autumn for a right-hand drive model to land. Expect prices from around £18,000. Renault's new crossover vehicle the 'Kadjar' (pictured) will go on sale in the summer on the continent, but Brits will have to wait until autumn to buy one here . Models for the European market will be built in Spain, but the Kadjar will also be the first Renault to be built in China. It'll be available in either four or two-wheel drive and Renault bosses say it's aimed at those with an adventurous spirit who still need manoeuvrability in town. It features an ultra-modern, soft touch dashboard with a seven-inch colour touchscreen display. The road ahead is illuminated by full-LED twin headlights with an intense and precise beam. There will be two different boot configurations make it possible to choose between a 'high' position with a completely flat floor to allow large items to be loaded, or a 'low' position to boost maximum carrying capacity. Handles inside the boot automatically unlock and fold the 60/40-split rear seats without having to bother the driver. Motorists are to have a motorway service station 'tsar' to drive up poor greasy spoon standards on Britain's motorways. Roads minister John Hayes said he is to launch an inquiry into service standards and prices. He will soon be appointing a chairman or 'tsar' to head it. He wants to see fewer mass market chains and more independently run shops, bistros and outlets, as well as more green spaces in which to relax. It follows moves by the Chancellor to force motorway filling stations to advertise their pump prices by the side of the road so drivers can decide whether to fill up or drive on. Mr Hayes said: 'Service stations were once rather glamorous. Crowds flocked to the opening of the first service station at Watford Gap in November 1959, and to Newport Pagnell which opened the following year. 'But like the motorway system they served, the glamour faded quickly. They became more notable for bad food, congestion and fighting football fans than for providing a pleasant, friendly environment for motorists and passengers to take a break. My vision for service stations is not just to offer a place where electric cars can be recharged, but also where drivers can be recharged, too.' Suzuki has suspended UK sales of its just launched Celerio hatchback following a problem with the brakes. The 1-litre supermini's 100-odd new owners have been advised not to drive their cars. The brake glitch emerged during test runs on two cars carried out by What Car? and Autocar motoring magazines at the Millbrook Proving Ground in Bedford. All stopping power was immediately lost when the brakes were applied at high speed. Suzuki said the recall 'relates to retraction of the brake pedal and affects right-hand-drive vehicles for UK, Ireland, Australia and New Zealand'. In a statement, it said: 'Suzuki is carrying out an immediate investigation into the cause of this condition.'

It'll accelerate to 60mph in less than three seconds and hit 120mph in a mere eight. The two-seater supercar will be at next month's Geneva show and production starts in September. First deliveries from the Maranello factory in Italy will be well in time for Christmas, though British customers seeking a right-hand-drive model will have to wait until 2016. Ferrari's new 488 GTB (pictured) will reach 60mph in less than three seconds and hit 120mp in eight seconds . It is powered by a 3902cc V8 engine — show cased behind glass at the rear — developing a massive 670 bhp. Top speed is 206mph. Such awesome power and performance takes its toll at the pumps, with average fuel consumption of just 24.8mpg and hefty CO2 emissions at 260g/km. Its launch comes 40 years on from the unveiling of Ferrari's first mid/rear-engined V8 berlinetta, the 308 GTB. It replaces the outgoing 458 Italia, which cost £178,551 on the road.

"Prince Charles (pictured wearing traditional uniform in Saudi Arabia last year) said he is alarmed at the number of young Britons radicalised online . Prince Charles says it is a 'great worry' that so many young Britons who are yearning for adventure and excitement are being radicalised by 'crazy stuff' online. The heir to the throne partly blamed the growing number of Islamic fanatics in the UK on a desire to 'want to take risks' but added that the most 'frightening part' was the role of the internet. His comments, in which he also urged young jihadists to show more respect to 'the values we hold dear', were broadcast in an interview with BBC Radio 2's The Sunday Hour, at the start of his six-day tour of the Middle East. He said: 'The radicalisation of people in Britain is a great worry, and the extent to which this is happening is alarming, particularly in a country like ours where we hold values dear. 'You would think the people who have come here, or are born here, and go to school here, would abide by those values and outlooks.' He added: 'But the frightening part is that people can be so radicalised, either through direct contact with somebody, or through the internet. 'There is an extraordinary amount of crazy stuff on the internet and clearly some people get particularly affected by it and join with others. 'I can see some of this radicalisation is a search for adventure and excitement at a particular age.' The prince added that he had been working with the Prince's Trust and other groups to try and find alternatives for those who are prone to radicalisation. He said he had been working in deprived, Muslim areas of the UK and had found 'interesting examples' of people who have been deradicalised after being 'horrified' by what they have learned. The prince also touched on the difficulty of preventing radicalisation, saying you cannot 'just sweep it under the carpet', but instead have to remind people of 'the distortions that are made of great religions'. He said: 'How you prevent radicalisation in the first place is the great challenge. You cannot just sweep it under the carpet. But the most important thing is to remind people of the distortions that are made of great religions, and the original ideas of the founders of these religions. 'Often you find their message is so distorted by their putative followers. That's the tragedy and, of course, traditional Islam does not permit this sort of thing.' During the interview, he also launched a staunch defence of the 'Christian standpoint', killing off speculation that he will take up the multicultural 'defender of the faith title' when he becomes king. Experts believe there are now thousands of young Britons fighting for the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, the majority of whom are said to have been radicalised online. The prince's comments on Islam and Christianity were broadcast in an interview with BBC Radio 2's The Sunday Hour with Diane Louise Jordan this morning . Among those who have made it to Iraq and Syria - usually through the porous Turkish border - are a Cardiff trio, who appeared on a jihad recruitment video last year. The three school friends – gap-year student Nasser Muthana, 20, his brother Aseel, 17, and their friend Reyaad Khan, 20 – were said to have jetted-in on a tourist fight to Antalya, in southern Turkey, after paying for a one-week stay at a five-star spa resort. They then crossed over from Turkey, via the so-called 'Gateway to Jihad' or 'Jihad Express'. In July last year, Zahra and Salma Halane, both 16, of Chorlton, Manchester, also ran away from home to travel to Syria, where they married fighters. The pair - who have since earned the sobriquet the 'terror twins' - had 28 GCSEs between them and were planning to become doctors, having just finished their first year of sixth-form college. They were said to have been radicalised over the internet. The comments came at the start of his six-day Middle East tour, which began in Jordan  (pictured) The prince, pictured during his tour with a group of Iraqi Christians who sought refuge in Jordan after having fled Iraq . The 'terror twins' Zahra (left) and Salma Halane (right), both 16, from Chorlton, Manchester, travelled to Syria where they married fighters after being radicalised online . Their father Ibrahim and mother Khadra had travelled to the region to try to bring them home, but without success. In December, it was also reported that 20-year-old Muslim convert Abu Abdullah al-Habashi, also known by a second nom de guerre of Abu Abdullah al-Britani, had been killed in action. Should Muslims living in the UK follow British values? Should Muslims living in the UK follow British values? Now share your opinion . Al-Habashi, from north London, was of Eritrean origin and converted from Christianity to Islam during his teenage years. He is understood to have travelled from the UK to join the Islamic State in Syria in December 2013. Al-Habashi was a well known and popular figure in Islamic State due to his media appearances. In August, he was interviewed on BBC Newsnight, where he admitted that his family had been trying to persuade him to return home but he had insisted there was 'no going back.' Days later, there were also claims that Abu Dharda, 20, also known as Abu Dhar Somali, was killed fighting alongside militants in the border town of Kobane. Abu Dharda, from west London, came from a British-Somali background and travelled to Syria via Turkey in the same month as al-Habashi. Another radicalised Briton said to have been killed in action is Ali Kalantar, 19, from Coventry, who was allegedly 'brainwashed' to fight overseas by a local imam in less than one month. The teenager - who had previously wanted to be a model - left the UK in March last year while studying for his A-levels. He left alongside two friends, including 18-year-old Mohammed Hadi, who has since been dubbed Osama Bin Bieber due to his youthful looks. Last year, Kalantar's father, who is of Afghan origin, described how he believed his son had been radicalised by an imam at a small mosque who sent him 'down this road'. Rahim Kalantar told the BBC that he worried about his son 'every minute' and that his grief is 'limitless'. Ali Kalantar (left), who was allegedly killed in action in December, had previously wanted to be a model and was due to study computer science at Coventry University, but left for Syria after being 'brainwashed', his family said. He is pictured with Mohammed Hadi, who was also radicalised . Abu Abdullah, 20 (left) and the man believed to be Abu Dharda, 20 (right) were two young radicalised Britons who are said to have been killed fighting for ISIS . On his Facebook page, Kalantar had also described how he had no intention of returning to the UK, despite members of his family travelling to Turkey to try and find him. Meanwhile, Mohammed Hadi's mother believes her son had no means of paying for transport to the Syrian border with his £14 per week pocket money and that religious leaders may have funded his journey. Other radicialised Britons include Glaswegian public schoolgirl Aqsa Mahmood, 20 - who was reported missing by her parents  before surfacing in Syria in February last year -  and Khadijah Dare, 22, who arranged to marry an Islamic State fighter via Facebook and moved to Syria in 2012. She has previously posted photographs online of her son holding an AK-47.","Prince said the growing number of British Islamic fanatics is a 'great worry'

"Two of the youngest Sydney sige hostages have revealed they considered stabbing gunman Man Haron Monis during the horrific 17-hour ordeal. Lindt Café workers Jarrod Hoffman and Joel Herat told how they were secretly armed with kitchen knives and switch-blades and grappled with how and when to make their move against Monis. Hoffman, 19, and Herat, 21, tried to seize an opportunity to stab Monis 'in the jugular' but were also concerned their actions would further place other hostages' lives in danger. Cafe workers Jarrod Hoffman and Joel Herat revealed to 60 Minutes they considered attacking gunman Man Haron Monis in a bid to end the ordeal. 'I've got this knife in my pocket and I know Joel has a knife in his pocket,' said Hoffman . 'What if I miss?' Joel Herat grappled with the idea of stabbing the crazed gunman. He was brought to tears when he recalled the moment he decided to run out of the cafe . 'I've got this knife in my pocket and I know Joel has a knife in his pocket,' said Hoffman. Herat recounted the thoughts that went through his head during the siege. 'He was, you know, right below me sitting on the lounge and like, do I stab him? You know, what if I miss? What are the consequences of that, you know?' he told 60 Minutes. Hoffman then decided his actions would lead to fatal consequences - potentially the life of pregnant lawyer Julie Taylor. 'We are so close we could do this but you know someone would need to jump, hold his arms down and then I would stab him in the jugular,' he said. 'But he had his gun, he had it on his knee and I could see that it was pointed directly at Julie Taylor's back.' For the first time, the rantings of Sydney siege gunman Man Monis can be heard from inside the Lindt cafe, as hostages were forced to make phone calls to media outlets making demands. Monis can be clearly heard during the 60 Minutes siege special, in the background of their conversations, making almost incomprehensible statements: 'You, you call her she's ringing some of the politicians now.' 'Very good that everyone know, because everyone today realise that politic they all lie and they all cheat but before today they didn't know about it,' he continues. 'Most of you they thought different.' Scroll down for videos . Gunman Man Monis can be clearly heard in the background ranting as hostages are forced to make calls to the media by their captor . The gunman forced hostages to make the calls as the siege dragged into the late hours of December 15.  In his comments, the gunman focuses on politicians claiming 'they all lie and cheat' During the Channel Nine program presented by Liz Hayes, pregnant cafe worker Harriette Denny spoke about the gunman's bizarre behaviour. 'It was very strange, he would have a big smile on his face when he would threaten us,' she said. 'I don't know why he kept smiling. But I will remember those teeth.' Ms Denny spoke about what she thought would be last desperate conversation, about her unborn child, with partner Jorge, who was waiting outside in Martin Place, powerless to help. Ms Denny, 30, revealed she had secretly kept her phone despite Monis' demands all wallets and mobiles be handed to him - and how used it during a trip to the bathroom to call her partner, Jorge. 'He asked me if I was in the building. And I said yes. And I said I loved him, as you would, because I didn't think I was coming out,' she admitted. 'You always think that you're not going to come out.' She said her partner made sure to say that 'he loves me and he is waiting for me outside'. Jorge had raced to the scene from a work site and watched on, helpless. Lindt cafe worker Harriette Denny told Liz Hayes on 60 Minutes that she thought a mass execution was about to take place when they were all up against the windows. 'I thought I was gone' and recalls her secret phone conversation with partner Jorge . Harriette Denny and her partner Jorge with the ultrasound in the weeks before the Lindt cafe siege . She also made the startling revelation that she prepared herself to be shot in the back in a mass execution inside the Lindt cafe. Denny, thought the moment gunman Man Monis forced all hostages up against the shop windows, was the beginning of the end. 'I heard him - I heard a velcro opening. I literally thought that he was going to shoot us. So everybody can see through the window, I thought I was gone,' she said. 'And I knew my family would be watching.' Pregnant 30-year-old Harriette Denny, has spoken of how she made a secret phone call to her partner Jorge who rushed to Martin Place when he found out she was trapped inside the Lindt cafe. She had made peace with the fact she was going to be shot, when she believed she would die inside the building . Two months on from the siege inside the Lindt Chocolate Cafe, the Nine Network has brought together eight of the surivors; Paolo Vassallo, Harriette Denny, Joel Herat, Jarrod Morton-Hoffman, Fiona Ma, Selina Win Pe, Louisa Hope and Robin Hope. Harriet Denny, the Lindt cafe barista who was pregnant at the time of the siege, revealed how she made peace with herself when she thought she was going to be shot by Monis in the early hours of the morning. 'Knowing that you’re about to die is kind of hard, the desperation you feel, the fear, you lose hope, thinking about your family outside, thinking there’s nothing you can do to get yourself out and it’s very hard..' she said. 'I remember sitting down and I thought I had a sense of calm. I started to be grateful for my family, for my partner and my friends and the fact that I know that maybe I won’t be able to have this baby. 'I was very grateful that I was able to experience the pure love and happiness of being pregnant so at that time I remember thinking if he shoots me, as long as I don’t feel it or see it coming I’d be okay with it.' Ms Denny continued. Joel and Harriette were among those who were able to escape the clutches of Man Monis from inside the Lindt Chocolate Cafe at the height of the Sydney siege . The anguish of the moment Joel Herat decided to make a run for it, takes its toll . Harriette Denny runs from the Lindt cafe as the siege reached its early morning climax on December 16 . As more and more people escaped, the remaining hostages recalled their fear, convinced that the gunman would turn on them in revenge as promised. 'If someone else leaves, someone dies,' café worker Jarrod Morton-Hoffman recalled Monis saying. 'They had left us. 'A glass or something just smashed and made this big bang and the gunman, he yells...""what was that?!"" And then everything just slows down,' Joel recalled. 'I didn't think I was coming out. Knowing that you're about to die is kind of hard, the desperation you feel, the fear. And without even thinking I just ran,' Ms Denny (far left) said . Selina Win Pe revealed that she faced the brunt of the gunman's rage when he realised hostages had escaped earlier in the siege. 'He pressed me against the storage room side door. And I said ""please, brother. Please don't shoot me please, please don't shoot"",' the 43-year-old said . He recalled when his manager Tori first told him to go get the keys to shut the front door. 'Well, generally when someone says, ""Everything is OK,"" ""tell the staff that we're not in danger,"" pretty much usually means that you're in a lot of danger.' Yet, despite being aware of endless opportunities to escape, the 19-year-old refused to budge until the very end. Louisa Hope, 52, who was at the café with her elderly mother Robin, prepared to pay for the escaped hostages with her life. Neither woman had the option to escape due to restricted mobility - Louisa suffers from multiple sclerosis and her 72-year-old mother doubted she could run at great speed. 'I looked up and opened my eyes and they were all gone. [I thought] ""Well this is it"" but at the same time ""I'm ready"",' Ms Hope told 60 Minutes. Louisa Hope is taken from the scene of the siege early on the morning of December 16 with shrapnel wounds to both feet . Louisa Hope, 52, who was at the café with her elderly mother Robin, said she had prepared to pay for the escaped hostages with her life . Selina Win Pe revealed that she faced the brunt of the gunman's rage when he realised more of the hostages had escaped. 'Now he's realised another two, and he's heard it, we all heard it. He pressed me against the storage room side door. And I said ""please, brother. Please don't shoot me please, please don't shoot"",' the 43-year-old said. Louisa Hope recalled thinking: ""Well, this is it,"" but also at the same time, ""Well, I'm ready."" And then he says to Tori (Johnson), ""Kneel down."" 'He shot him.'","Two Lindt workers who had knives considered whether they could kill the gunman who seized the cafe with 18 people inside .

"Her legendary character from Absolutely Fabulous once proclaimed that she hadn’t eaten a thing since 1973. And now Joanna Lumley seems to have taken a leaf out of Patsy Stone’s book – by giving up meals. Joanna no longer takes breakfast, lunch or dinner and, to maintain her slim figure, survives on nothing more than the odd savoury snack. Scroll down for video . Joanna Lumley seems to have taken a leaf out of her charachter Patsy Stone’s book – by giving up meals . Speaking exclusively to The Mail on Sunday, Joanna, 68, revealed: ‘I don’t eat any meals. I eat a bit throughout the day if I’m hungry, but not a big meal. ‘I’ll have some nuts or maybe some crisps and that’s enough.’ Joanna freely admits to being immensely similar to her alter ego Patsy, whom she has described as a ‘cartoon version’ of herself. Like Patsy, she became a dedicated smoker during her modelling heyday in the 1960s and still battles the habit, which is a well-known appetite suppressant. And at parties she prefers champagne to canapes – she passed on the nibbles as she enjoyed a glass of bubbly at a reception in honour of Grange Park Opera at Fortnum & Mason last month, which she attended with her conductor husband Stephen Barlow. She doesn’t exercise, and has said that being a vegetarian – and just keeping busy – helps her stay trim. The Great Comic Relief Bake Off: Jennifer Saunders, Dame Edna Everage, Lulu, Joanna Lumley . ‘I don’t go to gyms, but I do rush about. I do stuff with vigour, such as housework, gardening and going up the stairs two at a time. ‘I’m full of energy and never ill, and I haven’t eaten meat for 40 years. It’s no coincidence.’ Despite her aversion to food, Joanna spent a day surrounded by it when she reunited with her Ab Fab co-star Jennifer Saunders, who played Patsy’s fad-dieting friend Edwina, to film a Comic Relief version of The Great British Bake Off. It will be broadcast on Wednesday, but Joanna admitted her lack of interest in food makes her a terrible cook and a worse baker. ‘I have no idea how to cook because I don’t eat,’ she confessed. ‘I hate cake. I don’t remember the last time I ate a cake. I don’t like desserts and I don’t like anything sweet.’ Joanna and Jennifer will ‘Bake Off’ against singer Lulu – another Ab Fab regular – and Barry Humphries who will cook in full costume as Dame Edna Everage. Three more episodes of Celebrity Bake Off, featuring Jonathan Ross, Abbey Clancy, Alexa Chung, Victoria Wood, Chris Moyles, and YouTube blogger Zoella, will be broadcast in the following weeks. Then the contestants with the highest score from each episode will compete against each other for the Comic Relief Star Baker crown on Red Nose Day itself – March 13. Joanna admits that her baking efforts didn’t overly impress long-serving judges Paul Hollywood and Mary Berry. She says: ‘I’m dreading the Bake Off for Red Nose Day being broadcast – I’ll be exposed. The public will see that I am a disaster. We’ve filmed it already. ‘I’m terrible, absolutely terrible.’","Joanna Lumley, 68, never eats meals and instead has the occasional snack .

Ms McCall - who is currently presenting the second series of Channel 4 show The Jump -  said: 'I do still go to meetings because I just think that NA is brilliant - a very, very clever system,' she said. 'I've always been really nervous talking about it though, because obviously it's an anonymous thing. 'But it really does work and I've had an awful lot of support from NA over the years.

"'I left him to die'. Five words which continue to haunt one so young, Joel Herat, 21, who says he still cannot come to terms with leaving the Lindt cafe without his mate Tori Johnson. He broke down during the Nine Network's airing of 60 Minutes, telling Liz Hayes: 'Thinking about, you know, that could I have got him out? Could I have done something?' 'He was a dear friend. Yeah. I left him to die.' Cafe manager Tori Johnson was shot at point black range by crazed gunman Man Haron Monis. Told he too could have been a statistic if he hadn't fled, Joel Herat remains unconvinced: 'It's what people tell me but I just I just wanted everyone just to get out.' But he is not the only survivor racked with guilt. Scroll down for videos . 'I left him to die' Joel Herat is still struggling to come to terms with the death of his mate Tori Johnson inside the Lindt cafe . 'I almost wished I got killed in there' says Paolo Vassallo, the third hostage to make good his escape on December 15 from the clutches of Man Haron Monis . Jarrod Hoffman led the last group of hostages to escape the Lindt cafe siege in Martin Place but still regrets not getting more out with him . Paolo Vassallo, 36, is also consumed by the moments he decided to get out. 'Just wished I stayed there,' he recounted. 'Still kills me. Yes, as bad as it sounds and as ungrateful as it sounds and as ungrateful as it sounds, I almost wish I got killed in there. Yeah.'

Louisa Hope tells her fellow survivors of those last moments before Tori Johnson's life was taken by crazed gunman Man Monis . Jarrod Hoffman regrets not getting more out with him near the end. 'I thought that Tori was right behind me. I saw Joel but I thought I saw Tori. I thought that it was Tori as well. And I just thought we were all going to be okay. And I thought, I thought wrong,' he said. 'I got most out. But just not enough.' While some believed they risked dying if they stayed at the Lindt Café in Martin Place, others admitted to 60 Minutes that they felt a responsibility to remain, convinced by the gunman's threats that he would shoot one hostage for each one that fled. Mr Vassallo, a father-of-two who was one of the first to escape the scene at Martin Place on December 15, recalled the moment he offered 19-year-old café co-worker Fiona Ma the opportunity to run out with him. 'I said ""look, we're going now. You're coming with me"". She's like: ""I can't, I can't"" and I was like ""why, Fiona?"". I ran, I didn't turn around,' Mr Vassallo, who was the third hostage to escape, told 60 Minutes.

He also spoke of his deep regret at leaving behind co-worker Tori Johnson, who was shot dead by Man Haron Monis just before the siege's end. 'I said sorry to him. I said ""sorry that you're dead and I wish I could have helped you"",' Mr Vassallo said. Ms Ma, who was the first hostage to find out about fellow captive Harriette Denny's secret pregnancy – which she called 'a good moment in a bad day' - confirmed that she was simply unable to leave the others behind.

"A man sparked fears of a domestic terrorism incident after he deliberately crashed his truck through the gates of a Coast Guard Station in Michigan, assaulted a guard and made a bomb threat, police say. The incident unfolded at 6am on Sunday in Grand Haven where reports emerged that a man had assaulted Coast Guard personnel and made a threat that he had an explosive device in his truck. But after state police bomb technicians checked the 34-year-old suspect's vehicle, they reported that they had not found any explosive devices in his Dodge Ram pickup truck.

Coast Guard: Police officers stand guard outside the Coast Guard Station in Michigan after the incident . Truck: State police bomb technicians checked the 34-year-old suspect's vehicle, pictured, but did not find any explosive devices in his Dodge Ram pickup truck . According to Grand Haven police, the Michigan man broke into the station building where he assaulted Coast Guard personnel before they subdued him until police arrived and arrested him. The victim suffered minor injuries and is expected to recover. Grand Haven Public Safety Director Jeff Hawke said prior to the crash, the suspect had called the Ottawa County Sheriff's Office and said he was 'going to blow up the Grand Haven station.' This led them to investigate the incident as an 'act of domestic terrorism' because it was an attack on a federal building, Fox 17 reported. Local residents were asked to avoid the area of Harbor Drive and the boardwalk which were both closed until about 12:30 Sunday afternoon. A shelter was also put in place for residents at a nearby condo building while police examined the bomb threat.

But all local buildings have since been given the all clear and the police confirm that the incident is not linked to terrorism or any 'terrorist acts.'

"The family of an 82-year-old woman who had her purse stolen as she lay dying in the road after being hit by a lorry said today that they were ‘absolutely disgusted’ by the thief’s actions. Flowers and tributes from families, schools and businesses have been left at the scene where Irene Ditcher died following the incident in Leigh, Greater Manchester, at 11.45am on Wednesday. The late woman’s nephew and niece said in a statement issued through police: ‘We cannot believe that someone has done this to our auntie. We are absolutely disgusted by this person’s actions. Scene of the crime: Irene Ditcher had her purse stolen as she lay dying in the road after being hit by a lorry . Candle: Police  have launched a manhunt following the incident in Leigh, Greater Manchester, on Wednesday . Memories: Flowers and tributes at the scene where the elderly woman had her purse stolen as she lay dying . ‘Had Auntie Irene been alive she would have given them the money if they’d asked. We just hope their conscience gets the better of them and they hand themselves in to the police.’ The relatives of Mrs Ditcher - who was just over 5ft tall - added that they wanted to thank the public for the kindness shown in their loss. They said: ‘To our dearly loved auntie, who was taken from us - you now sit with the angels and your beloved family. You will be sadly missed by your dear friends. ‘And you will always be in our hearts but never forgotten. Rest in peace until we meet again. Good night, God bless.’ Police called it ‘one of the most disgusting crimes’ they had investigated, and notes of condolence have been left - with one saying 'Night, God bless', and a candle stating 'our thoughts are with you'. Shadow Health Secretary Andy Burnham, who is the Labour MP for Leigh, told anyone with any information to urgently contact the police, adding: ‘My heart goes out to the family of this lady.’ 'So sorry': Notes of condolence have been left at the scene by friends, schoolchildren and local businesses . Tribute: This candle left at the scene had a message from a family stating 'our thoughts are with you' Police said the thief had 'taken what he sees as an easy opportunity by stealing a purse from a dying woman' He said: ‘This is a proud town full of decent people and I have no doubt that the whole of Leigh will be united in finding this despicable act utterly sickening.’ Neighbour George Talbot, 61, told how he would see Mrs Ditcher most mornings. He said: ‘We’ve had the police in the area and they seem as horrified as we are at what this bloke did. Whoever did this is without doubt the most cowardly and despicable excuse for a human being I’ve ever heard of.’ Detective Sergeant Neil Lawless, of Greater Manchester Police, said the thief and had ‘taken what he sees as an easy opportunity by stealing a purse from a dying woman’. He added: ‘This is one of the most disgusting crimes I have ever investigated and I find it hard to believe someone could stop so low to commit such a horrific offence. ‘I am sure the community will be equally disgusted and I appeal to anyone who may have seen this man take the purse and walk off on Leigh Road. Sympathy note: Greater Manchester Police called it 'one of the most disgusting crimes' they had investigated . Roadside: Police said officers were told by witnesses that a man stole the woman's purse before leaving . Flowers by the road: A red glove at the scene in Great Manchester where Mrs Ditcher died . Probe: The force - whose head office in north-east Manchester is pictured above - have launched a manhunt . ‘There are a number of rumours circulating on social media at the moment but I would like to reassure residents we are doing all we can to find out who is responsible.’ Mrs Ditcher had spent the last ten years caring for her older brother Syd, who suffered from dementia, and sister Amy. All three lived together in a local terraced house until Syd passed away in 2006 aged 86 and Amy died in 2011 aged 90. Since then, friends say Mrs Ditcher made a daily trip to the local shops where she would chat warmly to staff. A force spokesman said that after the collision, officers were told by witnesses that a man stole her purse before leaving. The man is described as white, 6ft, aged between 30 and 40, medium build, with a dark brown beard, wearing a light grey hooded top with the hood up, light blue jeans and black boot-style training shoes. Anyone with information is asked to phone police on 101 or the independent charity CrimeStoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555111. Similar case: Ben Heney, 23, stole a mobile phone from a woman as she lay dying in a street in 2011 . The incident bears an alarming similarity to a crime in Manchester four years ago. In May 2011, 23-year-old Ben Heney was jailed for 12 weeks after stealing a mobile phone from a woman as she lay dying in a street in Manchester. Former public schoolgirl Rachel Jardine, 22, suffered fatal injuries after plunging 80ft, from a car park roof but as a passer-by tried to comfort her, callous drug addict Heney took her phone, later selling it for £20. Just an hour-and-a-half before her death, the philosophy student posted a poignant line from Jean-Paul Sartre to friends through her page on the social networking website. It read: ‘Every existing thing is born without reason, prolongs itself out of weakness, and dies by chance.’ Heney, of Hulme, Greater Manchester, admitted one count of theft - just days after the tragedy - before a court. Following a police appeal, the phone was later handed anonymously to a local newspaper reporter and returned to her family.","Irene Ditcher killed in collision with lorry in Leigh, Greater Manchester .

"Comic Relief has withdrawn a £100,000 grant to an anti-stalking service headed by leading campaigner Laura Richards – who The Mail on Sunday revealed last week had accused a fellow activist of stalking her. The dramatic development came as this newspaper learned that five frontline caseworkers at Ms Richards's not-for-profit company Paladin – National Stalking Advocacy Service, have resigned in recent weeks. Meanwhile, leading women's safety charity the Suzy Lamplugh Trust has stopped sending stalking victims to Paladin for advice following its own 'concerns' about the organisation and its capacity. Laura Richards, 39, (pictured) the civilian former head of Scotland Yard's controversial Homicide Prevention Unit, accused former campaign partner Harry Fletcher of stalking her . Last week, The Mail on Sunday reported how Ms Richards, 39, had alleged to police that Harry Fletcher – a 68-year-old fellow architect of anti-stalking legislation and a co-founder of Paladin – had stalked her. He strongly denies the allegation. Mr Fletcher, former assistant general secretary of Napo, the probation officers' union, successfully campaigned alongside Ms Richards for a change in the law on stalking in 2012, and the following year they launched Paladin. The new service was awarded large grants from charities, including Comic Relief, which last year pledged £148,000 over three years. But on Friday, Comic Relief said the remainder of its funding, totalling £99,334, was being 'suspended' – an unusual step for the Red Nose Day charity, which raises millions through its annual BBC telethon and other activities. Police have already interviewed Mr Fletcher, a former official of probation officers' union Napo, who is married with children. He strongly denies the allegations . It said: 'As a result of some issues raised by changes within the organisation that have been brought to our attention we have suspended the grant while we investigate further.' Comic Relief said the money destined for Paladin was channelled through domestic violence charity Safer Places, of which Paladin is a subsidiary. Ms Richards, whose salary as Paladin's chief executive is believed to be about £30,000 for a two-day week, set up the London-based organisation to deal with 'high-risk victims of stalking' in England and Wales. She charges up to £1,000 a day for private training work and speaking engagements with police forces and other organisations. Paul Infield, chairman of the Suzy Lamplugh Trust, said yesterday: 'We have stopped referring clients to Paladin because they didn't appear to us to have capacity. We were referring people and they weren't being picked up. 'I know they lost almost all of their staff. We are concerned about what's been happening recently – the loss of their staff, some of whom were very good, does concern us. 'And the situation – to use a neutral word – between Laura and Harry – concerns everyone within the anti-stalking movement.' Mr Fletcher resigned from Paladin in late 2013. In May 2014, Ms Richards went to police and alleged that he had stalked her – an accusation he categorically denies. Ms Richards told The Mail on Sunday that Mr Fletcher, who is married with children, was 'obsessed' with her and stalked her when she spurned his advances. She said she felt violated as a result. Mr Fletcher, who voluntarily made a statement to police last November, said: 'I completely and utterly deny these allegations and have fully co-operated with the police. I look forward to their inquiry reaching its conclusion.' In a statement, Paladin said: 'The safety of our clients and the high quality of our specialist stalking service has always been of paramount importance and we are continuing to build a strong team of experienced staff and management. Our service is being independently evaluated by a leading academic institution. 'We are taking legal advice regarding allegations made against our CEO and in respect of our service. There is also an ongoing police investigation and it would not be appropriate to comment further.' Ms Richards successfully campaigned alongside Mr Fletcher  for a change in the law on stalking in 2012, and the following year they launched Paladin .","Laura Richards, 39, accused former campaign partner of stalking her .

"A skull that was thought to have belonged to a Civil War soldier killed at Gettysburg is actually more than 700 years old and from the Southwest, say experts. The National Park Service has revealed that forensic anthropologists determined that the skull is from the late 1200s and belonged to a Native American man in his early-to-mid 20s. That's nearly 300 years before Christopher Columbus sailed to the New World and 400 years before the first settlement of English in the United States. Skull: The National Parks Service said that forensic anthropologists determined the skull is from the late 1200s and belonged to a Native American man in his early-to-mid 20s . The company that nearly auctioned the skull last year said notarized documents had showed it was discovered on a Gettysburg farm, not the Southwestern US, according to NBC 4. The firm - Estate Auction Company - was set to auction off the skull in Hagerstown, Maryland in June but canceled after members of the public complained. They then donated the skull to the Parks Service. An investigation is currently underway to find out how the skull's origins were confused, according to a spokesperson for Gettysburg National Military Park. Meanwhile, the Parks Service said it is still deciding what to do with the Native American's remains.","Forensic anthropologists determined the skull is from the late 1200s .

"The Sydney Siege survivors have revealed they remain angry about how police and negotiators handled the hostage crisis, as 18 victims were held against their will in the Lindt Café at Martin Place. The former hostages have opened up about their frustration that police allegedly did not attempt to enter the café or negotiate with their captor, Man Monis, at any point throughout the 17 hour ordeal. Innocent victims Tori Johnson and Katrina Dawson were both killed at the end of the siege on December 16. Mr Johnson was shot dead by Monis, which prompted police to storm the cafe. Ms Dawson was killed by shrapnel from police bullets during the stand-off. Hostage Marcia Mikhael has criticised the police for playing 'a waiting game', accusing the task-force of waiting too long to act and leaving the victims in a life-threatening situation for hours. 'There was nothing proactive about that operation, nothing,' Mikhael told Seven News during a special program which aired on Sunday night. Scroll down for video . Marcia Mikhael is pictured in the window of the Lindt Cafe during the siege with Katrina Dawson, who was killed when police stormed the cafe after 17 hours . Marcia Mikhael has criticised the police operation for only being 'reactive, not proactive', as she believes the SWAT team chose to only act if Monis fired his gun . Marcia Mikhael, pictured on December 16 was she is carried from the Lindt Cafe by police rescue officers. She was allegedly next to Katrina Dawson when Ms Dawson was killed . Mikhael has spoken openly about the dark thoughts she had as she remained trapped inside the café, as Monis frequently threatened the hostages with a gun. 'I was dreading the end because I knew the only way they could end it, it was for them kill him,' Mikhael said. 'And I was like, 'How are they going do that without hurting anyone else in here?' 'And it was a waiting game. They were waiting for him to kill someone or shoot something so they can come in. 'They were being reactive.' Ms Mikhael also suggested that it would have been more suitable for the army to have been called in in response to the siege. Marcia Mikhael (pictured left and right, holding a flag up to the window at the Lindt Cafe) says a phone call with a police officer caused her to lose all hope and feel abandoned inside the cafe . Man Monis was shot dead after holding 18 innocent victims hostage for 17 hours. He killed Lindt cafe manager Tori Johnson by shooting him in the back of the head . 'I know there were a lot of officers there who risked their lives and I thank them from the bottom of my heart. 'I'm not being ungrateful to them. I just feel like the army would have been better, more appropriate, to handle the situation.' She also claims that a phone call with a police contact made her lose all hope of survival and feel completely abandoned inside the cafe. Mikhael felt extreme frustration by the response from police when she called them as Monis' spokesperson, pleading that they meet the self-made sheik's requests. Monis demanded to speak with the Australian Prime Minister, Tony Abbott, in exchange for the freedom of five hostages. Ms Mikhael said that a police negotiator told her that Prime Minister Tony Abbott was 'a very busy man', making her feel as if nobody cared about their predicament. 'I actually lost it when someone, told me that the Prime Minister is a very busy man and he can't come to the phone,' Mikhael told Seven News. Ms Mikhael said that a police negotiator told her that Prime Minister Tony Abbott was 'a very busy man', making her feel as if nobody cared about their predicament . 'I yelled at him. I just yelled at him and I just...I couldn't believe it.' Mikhael says felt the hostage crisis was not being prioritised and could not believe there could be a situation more urgent than the siege at Martin Place. 'I was in disbelief. I think I actually said that I don't care what he's doing right now, whether he's walking his dog or playing golf with his mates. 'There is nothing more important right now than this and the lives of the people in this cafe. 'And then I hung up.' Ms Mikhael claimed that the comment from police led her to believe she and the other victims had been 'left there' and that 'nobody was going to come'. 'It was then that I knew that there was not going to be any negotiation and we were just left there.' 'No-one was coming for us. I knew that.They weren't going to come. So, that's when I lost hope.' Many Social Media users expressed their disappointment and anger after Ms Mikhael criticised the police force so heavily. 'Mikhael is a Westpac manager, not a member of the special forces. Leave them to do their job,' said Marcus Higgins, who said he was 'angered' by Ms Mikhael's comments. 'Marcia Mikhael just demonstrated she clearly still doesn't understand how authorities manage hostage situations #lindtcafe,' tweeted Shaan Sewak. 'I don't know exactly how qualified Marcia Mikhael is to be saying the army would've done a better job,' added Nohemy Vivas. Ms Mikhael also claims that she told Police Rescue officers to remove Katrina Dawson first, as she lay beside her unmoving. However, Ms Mikhael alleges that she was removed from the cafe before Ms Dawson, despite her protestations. The 43-year-old Westpac executive and mother-of-three also accuses police of 'treating her like a criminal' after she gave a police statement following the traumatic experience. She claims police will not allow her to access a copy of the statement she gave to police. 'I'm very angry. Why is it that I have two legs that kind of don't work right now? Why is it that there are two dead people besides the bad guy? 'I feel like I'm being treated as a criminal myself. Can't get my police statement. Why am I the criminal here?' The first hostage to escape, John O'Brien, 82, also says he is angry that the attack was not prevented, despite warning signs. 'Oh, I am very angry. Two or three months ago (before the siege), I said, 'Look, it won't be long before we have an attack here',' Mr O'Brien claimed in the Seven News Special Report.

"When Liberal supporters took to social media with the hashtag #ImstickingwithTony this weekend, their aim was to express their support for Prime Minister Tony Abbott ahead of a possible leadership spill. However the tag was quickly hijacked by others, who used it to highlight the mistakes and broken promises of Mr Abbott and the government. The top trend in Australia on both Saturday and Sunday, the hashtag has maintained momentum as more and more people voice their opinions. The 'I'm sticking with Tony' sentiment was sparked by a Facebook post written by Liberal backbencher Craig Kelly, who listed all the reasons he would be standing by the prime minister. 'Therefore, even if he'd given a knighthood to Camilla – I'm sticking with Tony!!' the post ends. Scroll down for video . Social media is alight with people tweeting under the hashtag #ImStickingWithTony, giving reasons for why they want Mr Abbott to remain as prime minister . From his stance on asylum seekers and the number of women in cabinet to the similarities between the current political dynamic and Labor's spill, thousands have been using the tweet to ridicule the prime minister. '#ImStickingWithTony because he gives my wife no excuse not to do the ironing', Herbert Vere Evatt wrote. '#ImStickingwithTony until we find the suppository of all wisdom', another user Ali joked. Mr Abbott's position as Minister For Women was also raised by many social media users, as was his Indigenous Australians and even his speech delivery technique. But the hashtag was quickly hijacked by those making fun of the Prime Minister . Social media users took the Twitter with jokes, angering Liberal supporters who came up with the tag . Some criticised his speech giving abilities . Others pointed out some of his opinions they didn't agree with . Herbert Vere Evatt made this joke about Mr Abbott being the Minister for Women . '#ImStickingWithTony because he's made saying the same thing twice, saying the same thing twice, cool again. He's made it cool again', Noel Hodda wrote. Despite the jokes Liberal supporters did jump to the defence of Mr Abbott, commending him on his achievements as leader, the Labor voices seemed louder. This is just the latest in a series of gaffes which have left the prime minister red-faced and having to defend his position. Most recent was Mr Abbott's decision to award a knighthood to Prince Phillip, dubbed a 'Knightmare' and widely ridiculed even within his own party. Branded a 'stuff-up' by even the most conservative media commentators, the prime minister's decision to knight the Duke of Edinburgh was very poorly received. Mr Abbott's declaration that he would shirtfront President Vladimir Putin at an upcoming G20 meeting was another of his widely criticised moves. When Mr Abbott, live on ABC radio, winked after hearing the caller on had to work on a phone-sex line to make ends meet is another example of what some called poor judgement. In a wink of an eye, Abbott became an internet sensation for his response to the phone-sex worker who called ABC talkback radio to complain about rising costs. Caught on camera winking to host Jon Faine before addressing the caller's concerns, Abbott earned the title 'creep' on social media. In Abbott's defence it was radio, although he appeared to have forgotten an important rule of politics - someone is always watching. The unfortunate gaffe which saw him declare he was not the 'suppository of all wisdom' was delivered to a room of Liberal faithfuls during the 2013 election campaign. In a wink of an eye, Abbott became an internet sensation for his response to the phone-sex worker who called ABC talkback radio to complain about rising costs . 'No one, however smart, however well-educated, however well experienced, is the suppository of all wisdom,' Mr Abbott declared. What he probably meant was repository. The linguistic fumble resulted in honorary website thesuppositroyofallwisdom.com, created purely to spit out Abbott quotes. Just one day after the suppository mix-up, Abbott relied on an interesting quality to link Fiona Scott, then Liberal candidate for the western Sydney seat Lindsay, and her predecessor Jackie Kelly. He told media they both had 'a bit of sex appeal'. Abbott played it down as exuberance and later dubbed it a daggy dad moment. Then, in the final days of the 2013 election campaign, Abbott made a last-ditch plea to voters via the cast of reality show Big Brother. In a message to housemates, Abbott told them to vote for the 'guy with the not-bad-looking daughters'. It might have helped him get elected, but when you're prime minister relying on the looks of your daughters probably won't cut it. Years before Abbott took the title of prime minister, a somewhat insensitive comment in Afghanistan landed the then opposition leader in hot water. While talking to soldiers about the loss of their comrade, Abbott said sometimes s*** happens. The gaffe was compounded in a subsequent interview when Abbott was asked to explain the comments. His reaction of 24 awkward seconds of silence made for compelling viewing.","The hashtag #ImStickingWithTony gained momentum across the weekend .

"Probe: HSBC is alleged to have helped wealthy customes hide their cash and assets from the government to avoid paying their full tax bills . HSBC helped 7,000 wealthy Britons avoid millions of pounds in tax using secret 'black' accounts based in Switzerland, it was alleged today. Britain's biggest bank used its Swiss private banking arm to help their super-rich clients evade tax and also advised them how to stay one step ahead of UK tax law. It was revealed after a whistleblower leaked details of 30,000 accounts holding £78billion between 2005 and 2007, with a quarter said to be held by Britons. Hollywood stars, royalty, Europe's richest families as well as relatives of dictators and people implicated in cases of African corruption are also said to held an account to help them evade tax. In one example, HSBC's Swiss bankers were prepared to help Emmanuel Shallop - a man later convicted of dealing in blood diamonds. Offshore accounts are not illegal but they are often used as a way of hiding earnings from HM Revenue and Customs. However, deliberately hiding money to evade tax is illegal. But even though 1,100 people who had not paid what they should have done were identified,  five years later only one person has been prosecuted. HSBC has today admitted wrongdoing in Switzerland but said that it has now 'fundamentally changed' since then. Claims the bank routinely used its Swiss operations to help clients shield their true value from the taxman were revealed by a BBC Panorama investigation, which found: . Panorama will air on BBC1 tonight and has seen thousands of leaked accounts showing how bankers helped clients – nearly 7,000 of them British – to avoid taxes. Some account details were stolen by a computer hacker in 2007 and were presented to HMRC in 2010. Scandal: HSBC's Swiss bank, pictured in Geneva, allowed its clients to withdraw bricks of cash, allowed clients to conceal undeclared 'black accounts' and gave accounts to criminals and corrupt businessmen . The Tories and Lib Dems seized on the revelation to question the role of Ed Balls, who was City Minister from May 2006 to June 2007. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said Mr Balls and Ed Miliband, a former Treasury adviser, should 'admit that they let the banks run riot on their watch'. Conservative Treasury minister David Gauke said Panorama 'throws a spotlight on the opportunities for tax evasion on the eve of the financial crash in 2007'. He added: 'It is for HSBC to explain what they did to ensure their clients complied with the tax law. But it is for the City Minister in years up to 2007, Ed Balls, to make an urgent statement about what he knew about all this and why the then government allowed tax avoidance and evasion to take place on such a scale. 'Since 2010 we have closed many of the loopholes exposed in this report and specifically taken action to get back money lost in Swiss Bank Accounts.' However, Labour frontbencher Rachel Reeves insisted revelations about HSBC did not emerge until 2010, so it was not something that Mr Balls could have taken action on. Shadow financial secretary to the treasury Cathy Jamieson said: 'HMRC were made fully aware of these practices back in 2010. There are serious questions for the Chancellor to answer about why just one person out of over a thousand have been prosecuted in five years. 'And why the Government's Swiss tax deal has been such an embarrassing flop, raising a fraction of the amounts initially boasted of by ministers.' 'Tax avoidance and evasion harms every taxpayer in Britain, and undermines public services like the NHS.' The banking documents which form the expose have now become the biggest banking leak in history, The Guardian reported. Among them are the revelations HSBC's Swiss bank allowed its clients to withdraw bricks of cash, allowed clients to conceal undeclared 'black accounts' and gave accounts to criminals and corrupt businessmen. The Tories and Lib Dems said the revelations raised questions about the role of Labour's Ed Balls, who was City Minister from May 2006 to June 2007 . The man in charge of HSBC at the time, Stephen Green, was made a Conservative Peer and appointed to the government . HMRC says that £135million in tax, interest and penalties has now been paid by those who hid their assets in Switzerland. HSBC claims that since the documents were leaked, it has radically overhauled its private banking business and reduced the number of Swiss accounts by almost 70 per cent since 2007. The man in charge of HSBC at the time, Stephen Green, was made a Conservative Peer and appointed to the government. Conservative Treasury minister David Gauke said Panorama 'throws a spotlight on the opportunities for tax evasion on the eve of the financial crash in 2007' Lord Green was made a Minister eight months after HMRC had been given the leaked documents from his bank. He served as a Minister of Trade and Investment until 2013. Lord Green told Panorama: 'As a matter of principle I will not comment on the business of HSBC past or present.' But Panorama spoke to a whistleblower who said HSBC had still failed to implement changes when she worked there in 2013. Sue Shelley, who was the private bank's head of compliance in Luxembourg, said: 'The verbal messages were great but they weren't put into practice.' She was sacked after raising concerns and an unfair dismissal tribunal ruled in her favour. Labour MP Margaret Hodge, chairman of the Commons public accounts committee, says they still need to be much tougher with those who seek to avoid tax. She said: 'I just don't think the tax authorities have been strong enough, assertive enough, tough enough in securing for the taxpayer the monies that are due.' Mrs Hodge accepted that many of the activities took place while Labour was in power. 'I think that times have changed and we have to move on. You have to remember in times past public finances were not under such tension, there weren't so many demands on them, you didn't have the deficit.' She said former trade minister Lord Green, who previously ran HSBC, faced 'serious questions'. 'Either he didn't know and he was asleep at the wheel, or he did know and he was therefore involved in dodgy tax practices,' Mrs Hodge said. 'Either way he was the man in charge and I think he has got really important questions to answer.'","Offshore accounts are not illegal but using them to hide earnings is .

"Britain’s families are set to face a hike in the cost of popular fish and chip meals, according to a new report. Food industry experts are warning that the price of fish and chips are about to go up as cod prices are on the rise as a result of tightening supplies and soaring demand. Commodity analysts Mintec reported yesterday that the price per tonne for wholesale Norwegian cod has leapt by 25.7% year on year to £1,060. Food industry experts are warning the price of fish and chips is set to go up as cod prices take a battering . Mintec analyst Mark Kozlowski said that increased demand, particularly from China, and a drop in supply - fuelled in part by a 10per cent reduction in the Barents Sea quota - has led to a sharp price rise for cod. With Norwegian cod accounting for around 20% of cod consumed in the UK, he warned that the current stock situation could lead to ‘tighter supplies’ with potential price increases being felt by Britain’s consumers. Mr Kozlowski told trade magazine The Grocer: 'Prices in Norway will indirectly influence cod prices from other producers.' But the report says that cod is not the only fish and seafood species to experience price rises with the price of Norwegian coldwater prawns soaring by 57% to £2,387 a tonne over the past 12 months with lower Canadian quotas leading to a tightening of supplies across the market. However, The Grocer says that British consumers are unlikely to have to start paying more for prawns any time soon as most of the prawns sold in the UK are warmwater prawns and prices for those are falling.

"A mother-of-two has helped hundreds of women beat infertility through foot rubs and reiki massage. Victoria Miles, 38, from Cardiff, says 300 babies have been born in the past five years after they've had treatment at her Baby Farm Wales natural fertility clinic thanks to an ancient Chinese massage technique. She says the key is finding the 'pregnant foot', the patch below the ankle bone that relates to pregnancy. Former car saleswoman Victoria Miles learned the ancient  technigue reflexology after having her first child . Rebecca Jones struggled to conceive for eight years until she had reflexology and conceived Georgie, six . A former car saleswoman, Victoria learned reflexology when she was bored at home after having her first child. After becoming a qualified reflexology practitioner, she helped friends but now her hobby has become a business. As well as the £60 foot massage technique she concentrates on 'changing the mindset' of couples, many of whom have spent years trying to conceive without success. Reflexology works on the basis that every area on the sole of the foot corresponds to an organ in the body so touching those places on the feet can help improve specific health problems. Victoria, based in Efail Isaf near Llantwit Fardre, said: 'We're a nation of brilliant, hard-working, often very organised people but so many of us leave having children to the last minute which can lead to problems.. 'We also have very full-on lives, partying hard and working hard the next day. Super-mum Victoria, centre, with her boyfriend Grant and her daughter Darcey has helped hundreds . 'It can lead to a lot of stress and when couples try for a baby without success, say for a year or two years, they convince themselves they are not going to conceive. It can be a vicious circle. 'What I do when people first come to me is give them a basic assessment, see if they are suitable for reflexology and work with them, helping them to relax, making them think they can conceive. She says the services at Baby Farm Wales can make couples sleep better, feel more positive and even increase their sex drives. 'What I do is half life coaching and half reflexology and I also have a network of people like psychologists, if clients have difficult emotional problems, and reiki and other practitioners,' Victoria said: . 'I find that by relaxing and de-stressing women and their partners it can lead to re-balancing of the hormones. She offers couples struggling to conceive foot massages and reiki to help them feel more positive . Clients feel, '100 per cent more positive,  relaxed, sleep better, have improved sex drive and more regular cycles'. Victoria said: 'I've become friends with many of my clients. You form a bond and when a baby is born, that bond becomes much, much stronger. 'I work with men and women and even have some male-only clients. 'One needed help after a breakdown and got to a state in which he could not have intimacy, which is pretty basic for having babies, and I was able to help him reach a state where he could. 'The success stories make you feel good. It's a job I love doing.' But there is a limit to the women she can help. She said: 'The only people I can't work with are those with ""transport"" problems such as fallopian tube issues but I have had successes with people who have had endometriosis and a whole host of other problems. One her clients is Rebecca Jones, from Cardiff, who had fertility problems caused by endometriosis, a condition in which uterine cells grow outside the womb. Victoria, who founded Baby Farm Wales, with her client Rebecca Jones who thought she'd never be a mum . Victoria's complementary therapies have even helped infertile couples improve their sleep and sex drives . Doctors told her she'd never conceive but within a few months of seeing Victoria she was pregnant with her miracle daughter Georgie, now six. Meanwhile an obese couple who'd been declined NHS treatment unless they lost 10 stone between them, were referred to Victoria in 2011. Victoria said: 'I started a treatment plan and we had a positive pregnancy test within a month, after three treatments.' Around one in six couples can have difficulty conceiving. That is approximately 3.5 million people in the UK. About 85 per cent of couples will conceive naturally within a year if they have regular unprotected sex but the chance of becoming pregnant is much lower for women over 36. Rebecca Jones, from Cardiff, conceived her miracle child after going to Baby Farm Wales customer. Rebecca was diagnosed with endometriosis at the age of 25. ''I was told if I wanted to be a mum I needed to come off the pill and start trying as soon as possible as the disease would significantly hamper my fertility and chances of conception,' she said. Victoria, left, with daughter Darcey, and right, Rebecca Jones with her miracle girl Georgie . She tried to conceive unsuccessfully for several years and endured the pain and side-effects of the hormones needed. She also lost her job after taking time off work for keyhole surgery to tackle her endometriosis so she started looking for holistic alternatives. 'It was at this point I discovered the benefits of reflexology for fertility and well-being and was recommended the services of Baby Farm Wales,' said Rebecca. 'During my treatment, I underwent the second laparoscopy to release my ovary which was stuck down fast in my abdomen. 'The surgeon managed to unstick this successfully but told me my right tube was damaged and blocked and needed to be removed. I was devastated as I had been trying to conceive for nearly eight years at that point without any luck. 'Now I would surely have 50 per cent less chance with only one tube.' But she says the operation went ahead and she continued with the  reflexology with Baby Farm Wales. 'To my delight I got pregnant naturally and finally had the baby I always dreamed of. 'I spent nearly eight years of healthy eating, cutting out certain things, eating foods to enrich fertility, supplements, operations, fertility treatment with no success. 'And I'm now blessed with the gift of being a mum after a long struggle during which time doctors told me to have a hysterectomy and to take a number of aggressive drugs.'","Victoria Miles, 38, left her job in car sales to learn spiritual side of sole .

"A 59-year-old man died after being left bleeding from the head on a subway platform while more than 40 bystanders ignored him. Radil Hebrich stumbled into the path of an oncoming metro carriage, and was knocked onto the yellow safety line, inches from the tracks. His breathing stopped and blood poured from his head. But fellow passengers, as well as employees on Montreal's underground transit system, walked on by. Bleeding out: Radil Hebrich,  59, was ignored by dozens of passengers as he lay dying on a platform in Montreal's subway system . Could have killed him: A coroner noted that the 19 minutes it took Hebrich to get help could have contributed to his death . Hebrich, who was drunk, was hit early in the morning. Security footage shows most passers-by either staring at or ignoring him. One is seen going through his pockets, though he did not check his physical condition, the Montreal Gazette reported. It took sixteen minutes in total for paramedic to arrive on the scene at Langelier station, and three minutes more for them to start helping him. In that time, three more metro trains passed Hebrich's slumped corpse. Two kept going, while a third may have called 911. He was declared dead the same night at a nearby hospital after the accident in January 2014. 'Apathy': The official criticized those around Hebrich for lacking the decency to help him, or call 911 . Footage of the agonizing wait was used to investigate his death but not widely released. The coroner investigating Hebrich's death indicated that the 'apathy' of the dozens of people around him may have sealed his fate. He told CBC News: 'If you're 19 minutes without CPR … it does not help your chances.' 'As for the indifference of the passengers... it says a lot about citizen apathy in our society.

The Chelsea defender said: ‘I got the . call from Roy and agree the England team should be about the young . players. I think it best I retire from the England team now. ‘We have a great manager and team and I wish them only success. I will be supporting them like a true fan. Thanks to everyone for everything. ‘Baines and Shaw are great players, proved this season, and are the future  of this country. It was a pleasure to get 107 caps. ‘Like me or not, trust me it’s hurt me to stop playing for my country.’ It is understood that Cole refused to go on Hodgson’s World Cup squad standby list, believing that at the age of 33 and with a long England career behind him, he has nothing more to prove. Liverpool’s Jon Flanagan will be named on the reserve list to provide cover for Leighton Baines and Shaw. Hodgson said: ‘This has been one of the hardest decisions of my career. The most important factor was speaking to Ashley prior to the announcement. He deserved to hear it directly from me and he took the news with huge grace.

Facing the axe: Manchester United pair Michael Carrick (left) and Ashley Young are expected to miss out . ‘I must respect his decision to retire.

(19), Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain (20) and Danny Welbeck (23) will be named . in the travelling party. Shaw . has enjoyed an impressive season at St Mary’s and was on Sunday night . reported to be the subject of a £27million bid from Manchester United. His . chances of being named in the squad were given a massive lift when . Hodgson decided not to attend Cole’s comeback match for Chelsea in the . Champions League semi-final first leg last month. Barkley, . who has come to prominence again after his special strike against . Manchester City on May 3, has made three appearances for his country. He . was rested from Everton’s 2-0 victory at Hull’s KC Stadium on Sunday but his emergence is likely to signal the end of Michael Carrick’s . international career after a difficult season with Manchester United. Risky: Arsenal duo Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain (above) and Jack Wilshere (below) will both be included despite their injury concerns . Although . Carrick was named United’s player of the year in their last . title-winning season under Sir Alex Ferguson, he has never established . himself as a regular international under Hodgson. His . United team-mate Ashley Young, who hasn’t played for England since a . qualifier against Ukraine in September, is also facing the axe. Although . Hodgson insisted this month he is under no pressure from FA chairman . Greg Dyke to pick young players, he will take at least eight with fewer . than 10 caps each. England’s . Under 21 coach Gareth Southgate hinted last week that the full squad, . who report for a World Cup training camp on May 19, will have a younger . feel to it. Southgate, who names his squad for the Under 20 tournament in Toulon on Tuesday, met Hodgson last week to discuss his selections. Hodgson . claims he made his choices several weeks ago and has been unmoved by . the form of a number of players.  He will include Arsenal duo . Oxlade-Chamberlain and Wilshere despite their injury problems. Oxlade-Chamberlain . returns to training this week and is in contention for a place in the . FA Cup final against Hull at Wembley on Saturday. Keeping his place: Phil Jones has overcome his shoulder problem to make the 23 . Fire power: Hodgson will stand by Rickie Lambert, who was a vital part of the qualifying campaign . Arsenal . manager Arsene Wenger said: ‘The news is good — he should re-integrate . into our squad for normal training. He is available to Roy and I . wouldn’t be surprised if he is picked.’ Wilshere . played 27 minutes at Norwich yesterday in his first appearance since . hobbling off with a fractured foot during England’s friendly against . Denmark on March 5. Wenger added: ‘The World Cup is one month away, . that’s plenty of time. It just shows you he has no problem to be . available.’ Hodgson’s . striking options were restricted last month when Southampton’s Jay . Rodriguez ruptured his anterior cruciate ligament in a Premier League . game at Manchester City. His absence means clubmate Rickie Lambert, who scored against United yesterday, is likely to keep his place in the 23. Jermain Defoe, who moved to MLS side Toronto in January, may have to make do with a place on stand-by. Norwich keeper John Ruddy, who hasn’t played for England since the friendly against Italy in August 2012, will miss out. Overlooked: Toronto FC striker Jermain Defoe will be placed on stand-by .

"Veteran actor Sir Michael Gambon has taken the 'heartbreaking decision' to quit his stage career because he can't remember his lines. The 74-year-old, who is best known for playing Albus Dumbledore in the Harry Potter films, has struggled with memory problems for years and has previously revealed that he has been checked by two doctors for Alzheimer’s disease. Happily, the tests were negative for the illness. But the Irish-born actor was so concerned by his memory loss that he took to using an earpiece linking him with a stage prompt while acting in case he forgot his lines. Scroll down for video . Veteran actor Sir Michael Gambon has taken the 'heartbreaking decision' to quit his stage career because he can't remember his lines . The 74-year-old, who is best known for playing Albus Dumbledore in the Harry Potter films, has struggled with memory problems for years and has previously revealed that he has been checked by two doctors for Alzheimer’s disease . In an interview with the Sunday Times magazine, Sir Michael - who trained at the National Theatre under Laurence Olivier and was knighted in 1999 - said he was now admitting defeat. He said: 'It's a horrible thing to admit but I can't do it. It breaks my heart.' He revealed that it was an audition for a new West End play which made him realise he had no future in theatre, when a girl in the wings was reading him his lines over an earpiece. He said: 'And after about an hour I thought, ""This can't work. You can't be in theatre, free on stage shouting and screaming and running around, with someone reading you your lines.""' The star - who began his stage career with minor Shakespearean roles alongside Lord Olivier – confessed that it was his ‘overwhelming fear’ of forgetting his words on stage that forced him to pull out of a 2009 National Theatre production of The Habit of Art by Alan Bennett.

At the time, it was simply announced he had pulled out because of ‘ill health’. Richard Griffiths, who had starred in Bennett’s 2004 play The History Boys, replaced him. Last year Sir Michael - who has played Shakespeare's Falstaff, King Lear, Othello, and Mark Anthony - said he believed the only roles he can play on stage are those with few lines, such as butlers. He added: ‘You know, the sort of part where he comes on and says a few words. ‘A role that’s played for laughs – like when the phone goes, he doesn’t know where it is.’ The Irish-born actor (pictured with Dame Judi Dench) was so concerned by his memory loss that he took to using an earpiece linking him with a stage prompt while acting in case he forgot his lines . Sir Michael became well known in 1986 when he starred in BBC crime drama The Singing Detective. He took over the part of Hogwarts headmaster Dumbledore in the third Harry Potter film after Richard Harris died in 2002, aged 72. He said: ‘Richard Harris had just died and they approached me and I decided to play it with a posh Irish accent, rather like Harris. ‘I’d never seen any of the previous films but working on the series was huge fun - and for lots of dosh.’ He also told how he trained as an engineer before becoming an actor, and once dreamed of being an airline pilot.

"One of the judges who convicted drug smuggler Myuran Sukumaran has revealed her guilt and devastation over the Bali Nine ringleader's scheduled to face execution this month. Judge Roro Suryowati has claimed she breaks down each time she sees the news that drug smugglers Andrew Chan and Sukumaran are one step closer to facing the firing squad. Speaking to News Corporation, Judge Suryowati, who no longer works in Bali, said she had disagreed with the decision in 2006 to sentence Sukumaran to death. 'My feeling has not changed. I feel pity for them. I feel sorry for them … Now if there is news about them, I often change the channel. It makes me cry,' she said. Scroll down for video .

Bali Nine duo Myuran Sukumaran (left) and Andrew Chan (right) could be executed by the end of the month . It comes as the families of the Australians on death row are due to make a trip to Jakarta's presidential palace on Monday to plead for the two Sydney men to be spared. Sukumaran's mother Raji and his brother Chinthu along with Chan's mother Helen and his brother Michael will meet with Indonesia's national human rights organisation Komnas HAM to set forth the legal battle in a bid to save the condemned pair's lives. Chinthu told News Corporation that his family have been struggling to come to terms with the 'awful punishment' as they seek mercy for the two men. 'Our days are very difficult, we can't stop thinking of what will happen and the violent way he will be killed. My mum keeps thinking about his and Andrew's dead body being handed to her, she is having nightmares,' Chinthu Sukumaran said. Helen  accompanied by her son Michael as they leave the prison after visiting Andrew on Sunday . Raji was spotted arriving at Kerobokan Prison to visit her son Myuran Sukumaran in Denpasar on Sunday . It follows after the lawyer who represented the Bali Nine ringleaders when they were first sentenced to death row is putting his job on the line by claiming he has new evidence that could save the duo. In an extraordinary twist, Muhammad Rifan says he has 'never revealed evidence' that could discredit him but he was prepared to ' take the heat' for the Australian drug smugglers, Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran, who are expected to face the firing squad by the end of the month. Their former lawyer told reporters on Saturday after meeting with the two prisoners in Bali's Kerobokan jail that there was still time before the execution to lodge another appeal to spare the pair, The Sydney Morning Herald reported. 'It's something that implicates us, it could discredit me. But for them I will take it. I told Myuran it's okay,' he said. 'It's one last thing I can do for them.' The pair's former lawyer, Muhammad Rifan (pictured), hinted at revelations that could aid a new appeal . He said that he felt very sad about their predicament, claiming the initial trial had been infected by 'legal interests and political interests' in 2006 . The lawyer said he didn't yet know what form a new legal push would take, but he was willing to try for the pair . Mr Rifan said he went over the case history with Sukumaran for more than an hour in an effort to work out how he could team with the pair's current lawyers on a last-minute legal strategy. He said that he felt very sad about their predicament, claiming the initial trial in 2006 had been infected by 'legal interests and political interests'. 'At that time they were going to be sentenced to life, but there were factors which saw them sentenced to death,' he said. 'We saw intervention that time.' 'Those judges, I believe they were very sorry because after sentencing them to death, they told me that was not want they wanted. 'This highlights the problems that time, between the Indonesian government and the Australian government. 'I see at that time, the judges were not independent in sentencing the case.'

'They were foolish boys who didn't think far ahead. 'This is different to the masterminds who were controlling it.' The lawyer said he didn't yet know what form a new legal push would take, but he was willing to try.

"An unsatisfied customer in California is suing the author of Fifty Shades of Grey and a British sex toy company for unspecified damages, claiming a lubricant they released under the S&M book's brand failed to deliver the pleasure it promised. The lubricant - Fifty Shades of Grey: Come Alive Pleasure Gel for Her - was one of many erotic products released by Lovehoney in conjunction with the novel's author, E.L. James, who approved each item. The arousal gel's packaging said users would 'experience enhanced orgasms and stimulation as every tingle, touch and vibration intensifies'. It also featured a quote from the tome's main character and narrator, Anastasia Steele, reading: 'I surrender, exploding around him — a draining, soul-grabbing orgasm that leaves me spent and exhausted.' Failed to make me come alive: California woman Tania Warchol claims the $14.99 'Come Alive Pleasure Gel' - which promises to deliver 'stimulation as every tingle, touch and vibration and intensifies' - did not work . However, the unhappy consumer, Tania Warchol, said the lubricant - which costs $14.99 - failed to perform, and also claims the slippery substance is incompatible with latex, according to The Hollywood Reporter. Warchol said she bought two tubes of the gel from an Adam & Eve store in California. She is seeking a refund and punitive damages. Warchol has also filed her lawsuit as a class action, inviting other California residents who were also displeased with the product to join her effort. 'Based on (the) Defendants' representations, (the) Plaintiff believed the Product has powerful aphrodisiac qualities and would increase her sexual pleasure as advertised,' reads the complaint, which was obtained by THR. 'The Product did not deliver the purported benefits.' Warchol also claims the lubricant has been mislabeled, because anything purporting to be an 'aphrodisiac' needs approval from the Federal Drug Administration. Steamy: While the Fifty Shades of Grey movie will be released next week, it is not involved with the lawsuit . Sued: Author E.L. James attends the ""Fifty Shades Of Grey"" New York Fan First screening at Ziegfeld Theatre on February 6, 2015 in New York City . The product has been on shelves for the last four years, following the runaway success of the book in 2011. However their popularity has increased ahead of the release of the much-hyped film adaptation, starring Jamie Dornan and Dakota Johnson, which hits cinemas on February 13. The range also includes nipple clamps, two different dildos and a Fifty Shades Of Grey Soothe Me After Spanking Cream, which 'boasts the luxurious aroma of sandalwood, bergamot and musk, Christian’s signature scent'. Universal Pictures, producers of the Fifty Shades of Grey movie, has not been named in the lawsuit, because they are not affiliated with the products. E.L. James - who sold the film rights to her book series, a trilogy, to Universal Pictures and Focus Features in March 2012 - has not commented on the suit. She attended the film's world premiere in New York on Friday night. Runaway success: The products were released following the popularity of Fifty Shades of Grey in 2011 . According to Entertainment Weekly, the lawsuit will have numerous obstacles to overcome in order to be successful. Above all, the action will have to prove the fact the lubricant did not work, which may be tricky to say the least.

"They may be political rivals, but Nicola Sturgeon and the leader of the Scottish Labour party looked like two amigos as they donned sombreros for the 50th anniversary of an aid charity. Scotland's First Minister and opposition leader Jim Murphy giggled as they posed with Mexican hats and guitars at a mass to celebrate the work done by the Scottish Catholic International Aid Fund. Music from Latin America, African drummers and an Indian choir marked the occasion at St Columbkille's Roman Catholic Church in Rutherglen, South Lanarkshire. The charity, which supports nearly 100 projects in 15 countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America, has given more than £63million to help improve the lives of vulnerable people. Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon giggled as she posed alongside Luis Garcia wearing a sombrero and carrying a guitar . Scottish Labour party leader Jim Murphy also donned a Mexican hat to celebrate the work done by the Scottish Catholic International Aid Fund . Ms Sturgeon, the leader of the SNP, said: 'Scotland can be proud that we have a fantastic international aid charity in SCIAF which helps millions of people to recover from natural disasters and war - and work their way out of poverty in the long term. 'From a small classroom in Rutherglen in 1965, it has become a significant force for good in the world, giving practical help like seeds and farm tools so people can grow food and support themselves. 'It also provides a clear beacon of hope for many in their darkest hour when disasters strike such as the current Ebola epidemic and Syrian refugee crisis. 'I'm delighted to have been able to attend this 50th anniversary Mass and join with parishioners and SCIAF volunteers and staff and wish the charity the very best for the next 50 years.' The political rivals joined parishioners, supporters and SCIAF staff for a national mass at St Columbkilles RC Church in Rutherglen . A procession of flags from countries the charity has worked in opened the Mass which was led by Bishops Joseph Toal, Peter Moran and Archbishop Leo Cushley. Mr Murphy said: 'SCIAF is a remarkable Scottish success story. For generations of Scots Catholics and many others, SCIAF has always been a big part of our lives. 'It's a good example of putting the Catholic Church's social teaching into often life-saving practice. 'SCIAF has changed and saved so many thousands of lives but the world remains an unfair place and the need for their work is as necessary now as it was five decades ago. 'I want to congratulate SCIAF on 50 years of dedication and hope that we can build a society free of inequality.' SCIAF's Director Alistair Dutton said: 'Thanks to the passion, commitment and support of the Scottish public to SCIAF over the last 50 years, millions of people have a much better chance in life and greater hope for the future.

The items  - featuring Chief Executive Leung Chun-ying - were to be sold at a market in Hong Kong during Lunar New Year celebrations later this month. They were bought by the Hong Kong Democratic Party, which is said to have made HK$100,000 (£8,500) selling 4,000 rolls of the same toilet paper last year. The party's Vice Chairman Lo Kin-hei said it planned to earn more cash this year by selling the products during the island's Lunar New Year fair. Scroll down for video . Hong Kong Democratic Party Vice Chairman Lo Kin-hei shows off rolls of toilet paper and packages of tissue paper printed with images of pro-Beijing Hong Kong Chief Executive Leung Chun-ying . Chinese authorities have seized almost 8,000 rolls of the toilet paper and another 20,000 packages of tissues embossed with unflattering images of Hong Kong's pro-Beijing chief executive . The seizure came after Hong Kong was shaken by a massive pro-democracy movement in which demonstrators demanded greater electoral freedom than Beijing is willing to grant. During the demonstrations, protesters expressed anger at chief executive Leung Chun-ying, calling him a puppet of Beijing, and asked him to step down. No reason was given for the seizure of the 12,900 dollars worth (£8,500) of goods in the Chinese city of Shenzhen, Mr Lo said. 'I guess (the Chinese authorities) don't like people mocking government officials, especially high-ranking government officials, after the movement. They have become more cautious about criticisms about them,' he said. The party's 4,000 rolls of toilet paper with Mr Leung's image sold out at last year's seasonal market, and it decided to get more this year from a factory in Shenzhen, Mr Lo said. The images of Mr Leung see him bearing two fangs, and another has the word 'lying' on his forehead. The sickle-and-hammer symbol of the Communist Party of China also appears on some products. The images of Mr Leung are cartoonish and unflattering. One has him bearing two fangs, and another has the word 'lying' on his forehead. The sickle-and-hammer symbol of the Communist Party of China also appears on some products . The order was placed under the name of a friend to obscure the party as the true buyer, and all communications were done through the friend instead of the party, Mr Lo said. He declined to reveal the factory's name and said he had no information on the whereabouts of the factory owner. 'We are worried about what has happened to him,' Mr Lo said. Mr Lo said the seizure indicates further tightening by Chinese authorities on freedom of speech, which is guaranteed in Hong Kong's constitution. 'Many productions in Hong Kong rely on the mainland. This kind of tightening means in the future it will be more difficult to make products in the mainland. 'It's alarmful for Hong Kong people that they keep suppressing freedom in Hong Kong. We will become the mainland if this kind of mocking will be not allowed in Hong Kong.'

"A Pennsylvania teenager has been charged with murder after he allegedly shot a classmate then posed for a selfie with the victim's body and sent the image to a friend. Maxwell Morton, 16, has been charged with first-degree murder in the case of 16-year-old Ryan Mangan, who died of a single gunshot wound to the face, and was discovered by his mother in her home last Wednesday. A picture was sent to one of Morton's friends on Snapchat showing him posing in front of Mangan's body which was slumped over in a chair, said police. Morton has also been charged one count of possession of a firearm by a minor, according to WPXI. Maxwell Morton (right), 16, has been charged in the murder case of Ryan Mangan (left), 16, after Mangan was found with a single gunshot wound to the face. Morton has been charged with first-degree murder, criminal homicide and one count of possession of a firearm by a minor . Morton was identified by police after he sent a selfie on Snapchat of himself posing with Mangan's (above) body . Mangan, a junior at Jeannette High School where Morton was also a student, was found dead around 6pm on February 4 by his mother, Rebecca Murtland. Investigators at the scene found a 9mm shell casing but a handgun was not discovered. The day after Mangan was found, a mother of one of Morton's friends told police her son received a selfie on SnapChat of the victim who was sitting in a chair with a wound to his face, according to the Post-Gazette. Morton's friend saved the image before it deleted itself, as SnapChat lets users send images that are removed from the recipient's phone after a few seconds. The friend's mother also said her son received messages from Morton that said: 'I told you I cleaned up the shells' and 'Ryan was not the last one'. The teen was discovered by his mother in her home (above) last Wednesday evening . Mangan was a junior in high school at Jeannette High School and has been described as a fun-loving guy by friends . Following a search at Morton's home, he confessed to shooting Mangan after police found a 9mm handgun hidden under the basement steps that matched the shell casing found at the scene of the murder, according to Triblive. Morton's phone will be examined for any other evidence and police are continuing to look for a motive in the shooting. Mangan's friends have gathered to comfort each other as they mourn his loss, and described him as a fun-loving guy who was goofy and funny. His friend Taylor Wiltrout said she just wants justice served in the case. She said: 'That would be the most important thing. That's what he would want. He would want all of us to continue on and go on like he's still here and do what we planned on doing.' A funeral mass is scheduled for Mangan on Monday at 10am in Sacred Heart Church, and he will be laid to rest during a private burial in Sacred Heart Cemetery. Morton is being held in a juvenile detention center without bail and is set to face a preliminary hearing on February 19. Mangan's close friend Taylor Wiltrout (above) said that he would want friends to continue on like he is still here .","Maxwell Morton from Pennsylvania has been accused of shooting Ryan Mangan .

"Comedian Bill Cosby, who has been dogged by accusations that he sexually assaulted more than a dozen women years ago, has canceled a Sunday evening performance in Boston, saying the heavy snow forecast for the area could make travel dangerous. Activists had planned to picket the evening performance at the Wilbur Theater, angry that Cosby continues to make appearances despite the allegations against him. Protest: Activists had planned to picket the evening performance at the Wilbur Theater, angry that Cosby continues to make appearances despite the sexual assault allegations against him . Cosby, best known for the lovable father figure he played on 'The Cosby Show,' denies the allegations of sexual assault, many of which are decades old and fall outside the statute of limitations for criminal or civil cases. His lawyer has called the claims 'discredited' and 'defamatory.' Cosby has never been charged over any of the allegations. He settled a 2005 civil suit alleging sexual misconduct. About a foot (30 cm) of fresh snow could accumulate in Boston on Sunday, according to the National Weather Service, blanketing a region that is still grappling with the aftermath of two major snowstorms since the end of January. 'Mr. Cosby just wanted all people coming to his shows to be safe,' said spokesman Andrew Miles. 'It had nothing to do with any protests.' Despite the Boston cancellation, protesters said they still planned to demonstrate. 'We are holding a solidarity action instead of a protest, same time and place,' Brandie Skorker, 28, one of the protest organizers, said in an email. Before the cancellation, organizers had expected more than 100 people to gather outside the theater, where the 77-year-old comedian was set to give back-to-back shows. Planned turnout: Before Cosby's cancellation, organizers had expected more than 100 people to gather outside the theater, where the 77-year-old comedian was set to give back-to-back shows . 'There is strong community here in Boston who is passionate, concerned for survivors and dedicated to fighting against rape culture - even if that means protesting in the snow,' Skorker said in an email last week. The allegations against Cosby have led some venues to cancel some of his performances, including one that had been planned on Feb. 6 in Worcester, Massachusetts, about 40 miles (65 km) west of Boston. Both Netflix and NBC have axed planned projects with the actor. Cosby owns a home in Shelburne Falls, about 100 miles (160 km) west of Boston, and he received his graduate degree from the University of Massachusetts Amherst. In November, the university asked him to resign as the face of a fundraising campaign. Cosby's statement indicated that he was considering rescheduling the Boston show but gave no specifics. 'We are looking at some dates,' Miles told Reuters.","Bill Cosby canceled a Sunday evening performance in Boston, saying the heavy snow forecast for the area could make travel dangerous .

"This is the dramatic moment a devoutly Christian couple who went on the run with their children after losing custody of them were finally tracked down - and the mother was arrested for 'attacking police'. Erica Carey, 29, and Cleve Goheen-Rengo, 23, were spotted in California on Thursday, more than a week after they fled with their twin babies and toddler son from their Washington state home. When police arrived at a Santa Cruz gas station that the couple had been sighted at, they discovered the youngsters - twins Moran Kai and Daniel and one-year-old Levi - unharmed. However, when Child Protective Services (CPS) workers arrived to take the children into protective custody, Carey allegedly lashed out, kicking and headbutting officers while begging Jesus for help. A devout Christian: This is the dramatic moment Erica Carey, 29, was arrested after she and her partner, Cleve Goheen-Rengo, 23, went on the run with their three children because they had lost custody of them to the CPS . Upset: The couple, who have twin babies, Moran Kai and Daniel, and a one-year-old son called Levi, were spotted at a California gas station on Thursday, more than a week after they fled from their Washington home . Taken into custody: When CPS workers arrived at the scene, Carey allegedly started kicking and headbutting officers. Above, a California Highway Patrol officer holds one of the twins at the gas station on Thursday . She was quickly arrested, but not before she had screamed at a local cameraman: 'Send a message to America for me. Children don't belong to the government. The government belongs to the people.' Her partner was not arrested, while her children - who had reportedly been underfed and deprived of proper medical care by the couple, who live a 'holistic Christian lifestyle' - were handed to the CPS. Officials arrived at Carey and Goheen-Rengo's Bellingham home on January 28 to take Moran Kai, Daniel and Levi into protective custody amid serious health concerns, according to KSBW. But on arrival, they discovered the couple - who hit headlines last year after saying they lost custody of their twins for delivering them via homebirth with no assistance - had fled with their children. Their escape was not deemed a criminal kidnapping nor an Amber Alert investigation. Instead, it was considered a civil violation involving the defiance of CPS court orders, it is reported. A 'Be On The Lookout' warning was issued to police across the West Coast, while local news outlets also ran the notice. This led to a member of the public recognizing family at the gas station. Emotional: Carey - pictured holding Levi at the scene - was quickly arrested, but not before she had screamed at a local cameraman: 'Children don't belong to the government. The government belongs to the people' Tracked down: Goheen-Rengo was not arrested on Thursday, while the couple's children - who had reportedly been underfed and deprived of proper medical care  - were handed over to the CPS. Above, the family . 'Holistic Christian lifestyle': Officials arrived at Carey and Goheen-Rengo's Bellingham home on January 28 to take Moran Kai, Daniel and Levi into protective custody, but discovered the family had fled. Above, Carey . On Thursday, highway patrol and Santa Cruz County Sheriff's deputies stormed the gas station, where they found the fugitive couple and their children. They then called the CPS to the scene. When social workers arrived, Carey allegedly became enraged, headbutting a California Highway Patrol (CHS) sergeant and kicking a deputy, while screaming obscenities and praying to Jesus. 'She head-butted one of our sergeants and kicked a sheriff's deputy,' CHP Officer Brad Sadek said. Carey was then arrested. She has since been charged with refusing to cooperate with law enforcement, resisting arrest, and battery on an officer, according to rawstory.com. Speaking to the site, a CHP spokesman said he could understand why Carey was so upset. 'We feel for their plight,' said Brad Sadek. 'As often as we seem like machines following orders, it still can be emotionally jarring for us too.' The officer added: 'We’re human beings. Everyone out there has kids of their own. We wanted to make it as comfortable for those kids as we would want for our own kids.' Mr Sadek said social workers and police had attempted to comfort the children during the incident. The couple's children had previously been removed from their home last November following the twins' birth one month earlier, amid reports they were underweight with improper medical care. Carey and Goheen-Rengo claimed their refusal to travel to hospital with paramedics - called to the house after a neighbor called 911 over Carey's birthing cries - contributed to the CPS decision. Dad and son: Goheen Rengo and  Levi, who was also taken into custody by social services in Washington State . However, the state denied this, saying the children were removed for health and domestic reasons, including the couple's apparent refusal to treat Levi's eczema with proper medication. '[Social workers] wanted the authority in my household,' Goheen-Rengo said. 'I told them, ""I’m a Christian and God gave me the authority in my household"".' Carey and Goheen-Rengo live a self-proclaimed 'holistic lifestyle based on their Christian beliefs',The Billingham Herald reported. Unconventional: Carey and Goheen-Rengo (seen together) are common-law married in Washington because they have never got a marriage license . The couple - who conceived Levi just hours after first meeting each another -  only realized they were having twins after the birth of the first baby in October, having not had one ultrasound. They were handed back their children in December, but they were still under state protection, so would be checked upon regularly. Carey and Goheen-Rengo were also made to undergo counseling. At the time, Commissioner Thomas Verge told the couple that their religious beliefs had caused a chaotic home life for their children. He added that if the state believed the children's lives were in danger again they would be removed. 'This is about second chances because you blew the first one,' said Verge to the couple according to The Herald. But Mr Verge also pointed out he could see the 'love you both have for your children.' When the CPS heard the children had been returned, they said, 'We accept this ruling and will work with the family to provide them with services aimed at helping keep the children safe in their home.' During the case which was heard in court in December, the state 'attempted to show an unstable household marked by numerous contacts with law enforcement … within the past two years and refusal to provide medical treatment to the children,' according to the Herald. It was only after the couple, who are common-law married in Washington because they have never got a marriage license, decided to have their home birth that the CPS became involved. 'I’ve done a lot of research about other women who have done it and they said the spiritual experience was so much more wholesome. It was just us. We wanted to preserve that sanctity and sacredness in our birth,' said Carey as she justified her decision to give birth at home. The CPS began showing up at their home after the 911 call in November and said that after they took custody of the children after  Levi developed pneumonia and ear infections. Assistant Attorney General Rob Olson told the Washington court that officials have been in contact with the couple 21 times since 2013 over their apparent refusal to provide proper medical care. Alternative: Carey, pictured, with Levi dmitted she did not know she was carrying twins until she gave birth.She has been charged with refusing to cooperate with law enforcement, resisting arrest, and battery on an officer . He said law enforcement had concerns that the children were underweight. They were also worried about domestic issues between the couple, such as Rengo's mental health and bipolar disorder. However, Christina Nelson-King, the attorney for the couple argued that 'Most of the safety risk was primarily speculative,' according to the Herald. 'Parents have a Constitutional right to parent as they see fit,' Nelson-King added. But he criticized them for their attitude towards the CPS which he said was doing its job properly. 'They did exactly what they should do,' he said, adding they tried everything to help the family and were met by resistance. 'Their lives are dedicated to children. They are not the enemy. They are the heroes.' Washingon Governor, Jay Inslee waded into the controversial case  to recognize the support the Rengo family received last year. 'I want to thank you for your concern and willingness to be vocal,' said Governor Jay Inslee on his official Facebook page. The Governor also sought to clarify any rumors surrounding the removal of the children by social services. 'I’d like to be clear: every child’s safety is our top priority in situations like these,' he said. 'Rumors have circulated that the removal of the Rengo children was due to breastfeeding or their home births. Those rumors are false. 'Breastfeeding and home birthing are not factors that would cause CPS to take children from a home. Their removal from the home was based on factors unrelated to a home birth or breastfeeding.'","Erica May Carey, 29 and Cleave Rengo, 23, have been in a custody dispute with Child Protective Services since the birth of their twins last November .

"This futuristic 'eco' treehouse is being booked up fast by romantic couples looking to get back to nature and discover their inner Tarzan and Jane. The cutting edge retreat, which offers a romantic bolthole amongst the treetops, is proving a run away success for farmers George and Julie Nicolson. The treehouse was designed as a cosy hideaway for two, nestling in its very own bluebell wood and surrounded by native broadleaved trees and the odd red squirrel. Scroll down for video . Perched atop 11 legs made of larch wood, the treehouse sits in woodland at a cattle farm in Brochloch in Dumfries and Galloway, Scotland . The built-in double bed also has a skylight so guests can gaze at the stars as they drift off to sleep surrounded by the rolling countryside . There are suitable touches around the treehouse that it's the perfect spot for couple, not least the intimacy of the dining table . More than fifty tiny windows replicate dappled sunlight to enhance the treetop environment, and despite being completely 'off grid' it still provides a gas hob, small fridge, composting toilet and walls insulated with wool to keep it warm. The built-in double bed also has a skylight so guests can gaze at the stars as they drift off to sleep surrounded by the rolling countryside and abundant wildlife. And despite the emphasis being on getting back to nature the treehouse has the luxuries of a full-size bath and a log burner. Perched atop eleven legs made of larch wood, the treehouse sits in woodland at Julie and George's 190-acre sheep and cattle farm in Brochloch in Dumfries and Galloway, Scotland. Although it was only made available to rent at the start of January, bookings are pouring in from couples looking to escape to the country for adventure and romance. A two-night stay costs £300 and can be booked through Bristol-based get-away specialists Canopy and Stars. While the bathroom might be a tight squeeze, the close feel of the whole place means you can enjoy peace and quiet with your partner . The morning views are something to be treasured - whether it's a crisp winter's morning or a beautiful and sunny summer's day . Julie said: 'We wanted to diversify at the farm to boost our lowly income from the sheep and cattle so about three years ago we asked Sam Booth, an architect, to design us a little off-grid bothy that we could rent out. 'As soon as we launched it it just took off so last year we challenged Sam to design another to sit in our bluebell wood, and he came up with the idea of a treehouse. 'It's far enough away from the bothy that it feels totally secluded. It's an ideal place for a romantic getaway, not to mention a digital detox. 'The treehouse is completely off grid but that doesn't mean you can't live comfortably - it's got luxuries like a wood burner, a double bed and even a bath. 'We only started taking bookings at the start of the year and already the treehouse is proving very popular.' The new 'Eco' treehouse is being booked up fast by romantic couples looking to get back to nature and discover their inner Tarzan and Jane . More than fifty tiny windows replicate dappled sunlight to enhance the treetop environment . The Treehouse was designed as a cosy romantic hideaway for 2 people nestling in its very own Bluebell wood and surrounded by native broadleaved trees and the odd red squirrel . Architect Sam added: 'We had previously designed another eco home for Julie and George so when they came to us asking for something a bit different we took up the challenge. 'The land they wanted it built on was in woodland so we thought why not build a treehouse. 'We drew a few scribbles of how we thought it should look - and the finished treehouse is remarkably close to those rough drawings. 'It's a celebration of nature. It's so much more than just a place to stay - it's an experience.'","Perched a top 11 legs made of larch wood, the treehouse sits in woodland  in Dumfries and Galloway, Scotland .

"A retired SWAT sniper who shot a gun out of a suicidal man's hand in an incredible move that saw him deemed a 'hero' has defended the film American Sniper's protagonist, Navy SEAL Chris Kyle. Kyle, who made 160 confirmed kills before he was shot dead by a mentally unstable soldier in 2013, was widely condemned following the movie's release because of the acts of war he had committed. But speaking in support of the late sniper, whose autobiography inspired the $264million global box-office sensation, Mike Plumb, who retired from SWAT in 2000, said Kyle was only doing his job. '[The film] was good, I liked it,' said the 64-year-old. 'The point of that film is not about the number of people he killed, but it's about the lives he saved. That's why we do what we do.' Plumb was working for special forces in Columbus, Ohio, in 1993 when he was called to a residential intersection, where suicidal Doug Conley was sitting in a plastic chair with a gun held up to his chin. Suicidal: Doug Conley is pictured sitting in a chair with a gun  in his hand a residential intersection in Columbus, Ohio. The 37-year-old had previously held the weapon up to his chin and waved it at police and passing drivers . Perfect shot: In unbelievable scenes, the gun was knocked out of Conley's hands - causing a small cloud of smoke (above) - by SWAT sniper Mike Plumb, who was lying hidden on his stomach on a nearby grassy knoll . Unarmed: Conley lifts his arm in the air in shock just split-seconds after Plumb fired at his .38-caliber revolver, which was knocked out of shot. Seconds later, he reaches for the gun, but is tackled to the ground by police . Defense: Speaking of the recent $264million box office hit, American Sniper, Plumb (left) defended the film's protagonist, Chris Kyle (right), who died in 2013, saying: 'The point of that film is... about the lives he saved' While Conley threatened to kill himself and waved the .38-caliber revolver at gathered police officers and passing drivers, Plumb made his way to a spot on a nearby grassy knoll, hidden by pine trees. Once there, he laid flat on his stomach and watched as the 37-year-old depressed man screamed at officers - whom he had engaged in a stand-off for two hours - that he wanted to see his ex-girlfriend. All the while, Plumb, now 64, had the scope of his Austrian-made Steyr SSG PII black sniper rifle focused on Conley, who was around 82 yards away, according to The Columbus Dispatch. Several minutes later, as Conley looked around impatiently for his former girlfriend with one hand on his left knee and the other wielding the revolver, Plumb was given the order: 'Go ahead and do it.' So, he lined up the shot, squeezed the trigger and fired. In unbelievable scenes, the bullet struck the tip of the loaded gun, knocking it out of Conley's hands while completely missing his body. Surveillance footage shows the suicidal man staring shocked at his weapon as it lies on the floor, several feet away. Seconds later, he reaches for the gun, but is tackled to the ground by police. Stand-off: During the incident in August 1993,  37-year-old Conley (seen holding the gun to his chin) screamed at officers - whom he had engaged in a stand-off for two hours - that he wanted to see his former girlfriend . SWAT: It is believed this photo shows one of the snipers called to the scene. It is unknown whether it is Conley . Scene: As Conley (pictured in the chair from behind) looked around impatiently for his former girlfriend with one hand on his left knee and the other wielding the revolver, Plumb was given the order: 'Go ahead and do it' 'Hero': 'My idea was hit it right where that cylinder snaps in, break the gun into pieces, take the cylinder out and, you know, disable the weapon. Game over,' Plumb (pictured at the SWAT headquarters last week) said . As officers secured a pair of handcuffs to his wrists, Conley simply said: 'That was a great shot.' Speaking of his perfect shot, which almost certainly saved Conley's life, last week, Plumb, who was in his early forties at the time of the incident, said he knew exactly what he wanted to achieve. 'My idea was hit it right where that cylinder snaps in, break the gun into pieces, take the cylinder out and, you know, disable the weapon. Game over,' Plumb, who had previously fired only at distant range targets, such as pieces of fruit, during SWAT practice sessions, told the newspaper. 'I heard over the radio, I had an earpiece in, the lieutenant said 'go ahead and do it'.' So that's when I pulled the earpiece out, let it lie there, zeroed in on where I thought he was going to put the gun. 'I adjusted myself probably a couple of inches or so, if that, and lined it up and just made my trigger squeeze. And it happened. It was a nice ending to what could have been a very, very bad situation.' Framed: Following the incident, Plumb was quickly dubbed a 'hero' and 'the best dude' by his colleagues - but he has not let the notoriety get to his head. Above, the gun he fired at remains framed at SWAT's offices . Weapon: 'I couldn't have done what I did unless all the men did their jobs and did what they were supposed to do. They afforded me the time to train with that rifle,' Plumb said. Above, his rifle is also framed at the offices . New job: Plum, who retired from special forces in 2000, currently works as Columbus's facility security manager (pictured) in 2007, protecting neighborhoods and city employees. He is set to retire in March . Following the incident in August 1993, Plumb was quickly dubbed a 'hero' and 'the best dude' by his colleagues, especially because no Columbus police sniper had ever fired a shot in the line of duty. He also made headlines around the world. Indeed, the footage of the incident has been viewed more than 8million times on YouTube, despite the incident having happened before the Internet took off. But Plumb has not let his 'notoriety' get to his head - he maintains he was just doing his job. 'I couldn't have done what I did unless all the men did their jobs and did what they were supposed to do. They afforded me the time to train with that rifle. I just did what I was supposed to do,' he said. Plum, who retired from special forces in 2000, currently works as Columbus's facility security manager in 2007, protecting neighborhoods and city employees. He is set to retire in March. Shot dead: Kyle (pictured), who made 160 confirmed kills before he was shot dead by a mentally unstable soldier in 2013, was widely condemned following American Sniper release because of his acts of war . Film: Actor Bradley Cooper (pictured alongside Sienna Miller) plays Kyle in the Clint Eastwood-directed movie . Paying tribute to the former sniper - whose rifle remains framed at the city's SWAT offices alongside the gun he fired at - Mayor Michael Coleman described him as 'one of the best of the best'. Conley, who pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge of inducing panic, was sentenced to two years' probation. He has since lived in Tennessee, Florida and Ohio. His current location is unknown. Since its cinematic release on January 16, American Sniper  has gained millions of fans, including Michelle Obama, who said it 'touches on the emotions and experiences' of many military families. However, it has also weathered a growing storm of criticism, including from the likes of director Michael Moore, because of the acts of war committed by Kyle and its portrayal of Islamic people.

"A British man wanted for questioning in Thailand in connection with the discovery of dancer's dismembered body in a suitcase has admitted leaving a bar with her but says he did not kill her. Shane Looker, 45, from Stoke-on-Trent, is the last known person to have been in contact with Laxami 'Pook' Manochat. The dancer's body was sliced into pieces before it was stuffed inside a suitcase and thrown into the Mae Klong Rover in Kanchanaburi, 70 miles south of the Thai capital Bangkok. Scroll down for video . Laxami 'Pook' Manochat, left, whose dismembered body was found in a suitcase in a river south of Bangkok. Shane Looker, right, from Stoke-on-Trent, has admitted leaving a bar with her but says he did not kill her . National police in Bangkok said Looker and Miss Manochat were captured on CCTV leaving the Nana Plaza in the city, an area that nightly attracts hundreds of foreign men in search of alcohol and sex. Now Looker, who is still on the run, has admitting paying a bar in Bangkok's red-light district, to spend time with Miss Manochat. But speaking through a lawyer to the Sunday Mirror, the 45-year-old says he did not kill her and is preparing to hand himself into police. He told the newspaper: 'Yes, I did know her. I'm ­happy to accept that I spent time with her. 'She is a bar girl that I knew previously and I ­accept that I paid the bar fine (cash given to the bar to take a girl away).

Looker had entered Thailand on October 31 and was last seen with Miss Manochat on November 2, police said. The suitcase - weighed down with rocks - containing her body was found in the Mae Klong River on November 9. Investigators' first task was to identify the victim's remains. Once that was done they were able to identify Miss Manochat leaving Nana Plaza with a well-built white man. CCTV images of the pair were distributed across Thailand in an effort to identify the tourist, but his identity remained a mystery until a tip-off to Thai blog Stickboy. The blog was provided with Looker’s full name, nationality, and an address in Hua Hin, 90 miles south of Bangkok, along with a photo of his passport. The information was passed to police. Looker had entered Thailand on October 31 and was last seen with Miss Manochat on November 2, police said . Officers went to the address with a search warrant and although Looker had already left, they found the shorts and T-shirt he had allegedly been wearing on the night of November 1, when he was captured on CCTV. DNA taken from a number of items, including nail clippers and a toothbrush, is claimed to match DNA found under Miss Manochat’s finger nails. The investigation also led officers to a shop where Looker allegedly bought rocks similar to those found weighing down the suitcase containing Miss Manochat's dismembered body. A new line of inquiry began - searching for the driver who took Looker out of Bangkok with Miss Manochat. It had been thought the pair had travelled straight from Bangkok to Kanchanaburi in the early hours of November 2. But police discovered he had checked out of Gulliver’s Hotel in Bangkok later that morning, taking a minibus bound for Hua Hin at 9.30am on November 2. The Nana Plaza in Bangkok, is an area that nightly attracts hundreds of foreign men in search of alcohol and sex . What police have not disclosed is whether Miss Manochat was with him in the minibus. Further inquiries, said police, have ascertained that Looker fled Thailand into Malaysia, travelling by train over a border crossing, on November 24. The Thai blog said it is understood that from Malaysia Looker headed to Ibiza where he reportedly spends the European summer months and has a share in a hotel in Ibiza town. It is not thought that he has returned to the UK. Thai police said they were seeking the assistance of Interpol to find the suspect.","Shane Looker at the centre of a murder probe into death of Thai dancer .

"The lawyer helping Harper Lee publish a sequel of To Kill a Mockingbird has detailed for the first time how she discovered the long-lost novel. In an interview with the New York Times, Tonja Brooks Carter said she was doing some legal work for Lee one morning last summer when she started looking through an old manuscript titled 'Go Set a Watchman'. At first she thought it was an unfinished version of Lee's only novel, but then she realized that the main character Scout was older and the setting about twenty years later. 'I was so stunned. At the time I didn’t know if it was finished,' Brooks told the Times. So she called Lee and asked if the book was finished. 'She said, ""Complete? I guess so. It was the parent of “Mockingbird.”' Scroll down for video . Reclusive author Harper Lee (pictured in 2007, left) is set to release her second novel ever - a follow-up to the classic To Kill a Mockingbird. Her lawyer Tonja Carter (right) found the long lost manuscript last summer, while doing some legal work for her famous client . While the upcoming publishing of Watchman has been heralded as one of the biggest discoveries in literary history, many have expressed skepticism that 88-year-old Lee is lucid enough to have supported the decision. When Mockingbird became an instant success in 1960, Lee vowed to never publish again saying: 'I wrote one good book and that was enough'. As the woman who both discovered the novel, and is helping to publish it, Carter has become the target of some of these conspiracy theories. For year's, Harper's sister Alice protected her authorial rights as a lawyer with the firm Barnett, Bugg, Lee and Carter in Monroeville, Alabama - the same law firm their father helped found. To Kill a Mockingbird follows a young girl named Scout as she grows up in a small southern town during the depression. Lee's follow up, Go Set a Watchman, also focuses on Scout, but twenty years later. On the right, the design currently being used to sell pre-orders of the book on Amazon. It's unclear if this is the finished design . But when Alice Lee passed away last November, it was Carter that took over as the author's champion. Sources close to both Carter and Lee have mostly defended the release of Watchman, though it breaks with the author's previous vow not to publish again. Connie Baggett, a former newspaper reporter and a longtime friend of Carter, said Friday that the attorney was trusted implicitly by Alice Lee and in turn by Harper, whom locals call by her first name, Nelle. 'She's not some interloper,' said Baggett, who came to know Carter and the Lees during two decades of covering southwest Alabama for the Mobile Press-Register. 'She's been part of the inner circle for years.' Harper Lee used to split time between New York and Alabama but has lived full-time in Monroeville, halfway between Montgomery and Mobile, since suffering a stroke in 2007. She was last seen publicly at her sister's funeral, where she talked loudly to herself about seemingly unrelated things in a manner that alarmed those present, according to several who were there but insisted on anonymity for fear of upsetting those close to the family. But historian Wayne Flynt, another longtime friend of the sisters, said he visited Harper Lee the day before the deal was announced, and found her completely lucid, cracking jokes and discussing the works of C.S. Lewis, though she didn't mention her own new book. 'This narrative of senility, exploitation of this helpless little old lady, is just hogwash. It's just complete bunk,' Flynt said, adding that he has 'no reason to question Tonja Carter's integrity.' It's important to note, Flynt said, that 'Alice brought her in, kept her as a partner. She let her work increasingly with Nelle.' The 88-year-old Lee is nearly blind and deaf and lives in an assisted living center in town. Relatives and others close her typically don't comment about publicly about her in deference to the publicity-shy author's wishes. Carter fits the mold: She hasn't responded to interview requests. Harper Lee's sister Alice Lee helped protect her sister's authorial rights for years, but passed away in November. Carter took over representing Lee's To Kill a Mockingbird interests after that. Alice (left) and Harper (right) Lee pictured above on September 11, 2006 - Alice's 95th birthday . With a title taken from the Old Testament book of Isaiah, 'Watchman' will be released in July and already is No. 1 on Amazon based on pre-orders. The new book is set about 20 years after 'Mockingbird,' in which attorney Atticus Finch defends a black man wrongly accused of raping a white woman in the 1930s. In the sequel, Finch's daughter, Scout, returns to her Alabama from New York to confront attitudes and feelings about her childhood home. 'I'm alive and kicking and happy as hell with the reactions of 'Watchman,'' the author said in a statement relayed through Carter and attributed to her Thursday by the publisher. Carter handled Alice Lee's will following her death. Then, as Harper Lee's attorney, one of their first salvos was a lawsuit in May 2013 against the son-in-law of a former literary agent, which restored control of the copyright for 'Mockingbird.' Some have remained skeptical about the sequel's upcoming release, since Harper Lee previously vowed never to publish again. The author pictured center at the assisted living home where she's a resident in Monroeville, Alabama . Carter had signed a document in which Lee had reaffirmed her desire to give away the rights, but Carter also fought to restore those same rights to Lee, according to the complaint filed on Lee's behalf by a New York law firm. Lee then sought a trademark for 'To Kill A Mockingbird' items, like the knick-knacks sold in a town museum that includes displays about the book. The museum opposed the trademark request, and then it too was sued by Lee, accused of wrongly selling 'Mockingbird' memorabilia without authorization and without paying royalties. Baggett, whose parents were eulogized by Carter and her husband Patrick following their deaths, said the proliferation of 'Mockingbird' related products was part of the reason Carter advised Lee to more aggressively protect her interests and income after her sister's retirement. 'Nelle was fiercely protective of the characters in her book while Alice was handling things,' Baggett said. 'As things have unfolded, Tonja took action. I can't imagine anyone looking out for the interests of the book and for Nelle who wouldn't do the same.' The lawsuits were settled, but more controversy erupted last year when author Marja Mills published her book 'The Mockingbird Next Door: Life with Harper Lee.' The former Chicago Tribune writer had moved next door to the sisters in 2004 and documented their quiet lives in the city that inspired Maycomb, the setting in the novel. Harper Lee released a statement through Carter saying the book wasn't authorized, prompting Alice Lee to send her own hand-written apology to Mills. In it, Alice Lee said Carter had created the statement, and had Harper Lee sign it. 'Poor Nelle Lee can't see and can't hear and will sign anything put before her by anyone in whom she has confidence,' her sister wrote. 'Now she has no memory of the incident.' To Kill a Mockingbird was turned into a film in 1962, starring Gregory Peck as Scout's lawyer-father Atticus Finch . Alice Lee describes confronting Carter in the letter, provided to the AP by Mills, and said the whole episode left her 'humiliated, embarrassed and upset about the suggestion of the lack of integrity at my office.' Alice Lee died at 103 on Nov. 17. It was also in the fall, according to the publisher, that Carter found an unpublished manuscript of 'Go Set a Watchman' attached to an original typescript of 'To Kill A Mockingbird.' Baggett, who now works for the south Alabama town of Brewton, rejected suggestions by some that Carter was trying to personally profit from legal disputes involving Harper Lee, or the new book. 'I think if there were a motive of greed, family members would have stormed in to put a stop to things,' said Baggett. 'I have not seen that happening.'jree . It was Carter who filed Alice Lee's will in Monroe County Probate Court. Lee left her estate to relatives and made donations to organizations affiliated with the United Methodist Church, in which she was heavily involved. Harper Lee was among the relatives who signed documents waiving their right to receive notice of probate proceedings about the will, witnessed by Carter and signed by Alice Lee in 2009 while she was still practicing law on a limited basis. Such waivers are common and typically signal that relatives won't contest the will. Harper Lee has received honors including the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2007 and the Alabama Academy of Honor in 2001, but even then, she wasn't much for speaking. Asked to make remarks at the state ceremony, she said simply: 'Well, it's better to be silent than be a fool.'","Tonja Brooks Carter found the manuscript last summer while doing legal work for her famous client .

"The controversial £100 fine for late income-tax returns could be axed after the taxman admitted it was punishing honest taxpayers who miss the deadline by a day. HM Revenue and Customs said it may hit workers unfairly for making a ‘simple mistake’ or an ‘uncharacteristic failure’. At the moment, those who return their tax form even just 24 hours late are billed £100 – the same as someone who misses the deadline by almost three months. HM Revenue & Customs said it wants to 'change the way that penalties are applied' after admitting the current system doesn't differentiate between deliberate non-compliers and those who make an accidental error . It is now considering replacing the automatic fine – which has been in place for 20 years – with motoring-style penalty points designed to punish repeat offenders. The proposal could mean hundreds of thousands of Britons who fail to complete the complex self-assessment forms on time every year could escape a penalty. Under plans put out for public consultation, HMRC said the system ‘makes no distinction between a customer who misses a deadline by a day or two and someone who has made no attempt to comply at all’. It added: ‘We want to consider whether we could better differentiate between deliberate and persistent non-compliers and those who might make an occasional error. ‘One option could be a progressive system similar to penalty points for motoring offences so that initial financial penalties are avoided, but more substantial penalties then apply for more serious failures or for persistent non-compliance.’ Hundreds of thousands of middle-class families were dragged into filling out self-assessment forms for the first time last year following cuts to child benefit for higher-rate taxpayers. Thousands were then hit with fines when they failed to fill out their assessments on time. Under the new proposals, which are up for public consultation, high interest rates could be applied to taxpayers' debts - which may encourage them to pay up sooner - instead of fines being issues by HMRC . HMRC said it would also look at extending the list of reasonable excuses it will accept for late tax returns. The Government will currently waive a penalty only for the death of a spouse, an unexpected hospital stay or a fire. Under current regulations, those who didn't complete their self-assessment tax return forms by midnight on the January 31 deadline will immediately receive a £100 penalty, even if they had no tax to pay. If the forms still have not been completed after three months, £10 a day will be added to the fine, up to a maximum of £900. After six months, an additional penalty of either five per cent of the tax due or £300 - whichever is greater - will be added. This amount will be added again if the tax return has still not been completed 12 months after the deadline. On last year's deadline day, 557,000 people scrambled to get their returns in online and some 700,000 missed the deadline. Having difficulty filling out the complicated form, forgetting the deadline or struggling with your first self-assessment are not accepted. Officials said the list of excuses ‘may need updating to better support those genuinely wanting to comply’. This year, more than 10.2million tax forms were returned before the deadline of midnight on January 31, but 890,000 people were late. Chas Roy-Chowdhury, of the Association of Chartered Certified Accountants said the current penalties were used as an unjust source of income for the Government. He added: ‘We seem to have lost sight of the fact that the taxpayer is the unpaid administrator of tax compliance and we should be looking to smarter ways of dealing with late filers.’ HMRC acknowledged that taxpayers are fined for late returns even when they do not owe any money. Before 2012, a penalty was cancelled if no tax was due. The taxman said fines also could be counter-productive if they ‘undermine people’s natural motivation to comply’. If penalties are deemed to be unfair or disproportionate, it said, ‘research suggests this can lead to increased non-compliance’. But Stuart Phillips, of wealth management firm The Private Office, said: ‘It makes a lot of sense to create more targeted fines for those who are intentionally choosing not to comply with self-assessment. ‘But the removal of the automatic fine could reduce the motivation for people to ensure their returns are submitted on time.’","HM Revenue & Customs has issued new proposals for tax return penalties .

"Wild orcas gently rub their bellies on smooth stones in shallow waters off Vancouver Island, Canada, in remarkable amateur footage taken by a builder who was working nearby. From a mere few feet away Chris Wilton filmed a pod of orcas, otherwise known as killer whales, at Bates Beach in Courtenay, British Columbia. 'I was at work putting a new roof on a home when we heard what sounded like orca's coming around the corner,' Chris said. 'We ran out front to see and were quite amazed to see what was happening. An adult and juvenile orca rub their bellies on smooth stones in shallow water of Vancouver Island . Chris Wilton took the footage of the pod of orcas at Bates Beach in Courtenay in British Columbia . 'There were four or five orca's coming in and out of the beach and swimming right up ashore within six feet of us.' Chris says while the intimate footage posted on the internet goes for four minutes and 20 seconds, the display in fact lasted about an hour. 'It was one of the most amazing things I have ever seen,' he added. The Orca Network posted his video on its Facebook page with a quote from 'The Marine Detective' blogger Jackie Hildering: 'Absolutely remarkable footage of northern resident orcas with their culturally unique behaviour of rubbing themselves on beaches like this. Wilton said the display lasted about an hour and that 'It was one of the most amazing things I have ever seen' 'The Marine Detective' blogger Jackie Hildering said the display was unique to the northern resident orcas . 'I happen to be with whale researchers Janie Wray and Christie McMillan, and we believe these whales are the A42 matriline. The big male is very distinct. He is A66 born in 1996.' Less scientific but just as  bewildered, the group of men witnessing the display were heard saying 'This is crazy', 'Powerful' and 'Holy moly'. Another added: 'I think they're trying to splash us.' The orcas swam away from the shore before coming back to rub their underside on the stones . The northern resident orcas are renowned for their belly rubbing behaviour but scientists aren't certain as to why they do it. The answer may have come from one of the men on the shore at Bates Beach: 'It probably feels like a nice massage.'","Orcas gave an incredible display near Courtenay on Vancouver Island .

"The lawyer who represented the Bali Nine ringleaders when they were first sentenced to death row is putting his job on the line by claiming he has new evidence that could save the condemned pair's lives. In an extraordinary twist, Muhammad Rifan says he has 'never revealed evidence' that could discredit him but he was prepared to ' take the heat' for the Australian drug smugglers, Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran, who are expected to face the firing squad by the end of the month. Their former lawyer told reporters on Saturday after meeting with the two prisoners in Bali's Kerobokan jail that there was still time before the execution to lodge another appeal to spare the pair, The Sydney Morning Herald reported. 'It's something that implicates us, it could discredit me. But for them I will take it. I told Myuran it's okay,' he said. 'It's one last thing I can do for them.' Scroll down for video . Bali Nine ringleaders Myuran Sukumaran (left) and Andrew Chan (right) could be executed by the end of the month . The pair's former lawyer, Muhammad Rifan (pictured), hinted at revelations that could aid a new appeal after meeting his former clients . Mr Rifan said he went over the case history with Sukumaran for more than an hour in an effort to work out how he could team with the pair's current lawyers on a last-minute legal strategy. He said that he felt very sad about their predicament, claiming the initial trial in 2006 had been infected by 'legal interests and political interests'. 'At that time they were going to be sentenced to life, but there were factors which saw them sentenced to death,' he said. 'We saw intervention that time.' 'Those judges, I believe they were very sorry because after sentencing them to death, they told me that was not want they wanted. 'This highlights the problems that time, between the Indonesian government and the Australian government. 'I see at that time, the judges were not independent in sentencing the case.' Mr Rifan said he was witness to the efforts Chan and Sukumaran had made to change themselves and other prisoners for the better. 'They don't deserve to be punished with death,' he said. 'They were foolish boys who didn't think far ahead. 'This is different to the masterminds who were controlling it.' The lawyer said he didn't yet know what form a new legal push would take, but he was willing to try. Likewise, he urged Australia to continue diplomatic efforts for the Sydney men 'until the last minute'. He said that he felt very sad about their predicament, claiming the initial trial had been infected by 'legal interests and political interests' in 2006 . The lawyer said he didn't yet know what form a new legal push would take, but he was willing to try for the pair . This comes just two days before Sukumaran's mother and sister tearfully pleaded for him to be spared after they received official word he and Andrew Chan will be executed this month. It comes after the Australian drug smugglers had their second bid for clemency officially rejected on Wednesday, dashing their final hope of avoiding the firing squad. For two weeks, the families of Sukumaran and his co-ringleader in the 2005 Bali Nine plot, Chan, have walked silently in and out of Kerobokan jail for twice-daily visiting hours. Australia's consul-general Majel Hind brought confirmation from Indonesian authorities on Friday that the execution will be carried out within three weeks. Death-row prisoner Myuran Sukumaran's sister Brintha and mother Raji  talk to media after their visit . Australians on death row Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran are scheduled for execution this month . Sukumaran's mother Raji, brother Chintu and sister Brintha left the prison feeling distraught as they spoke with reporters waiting outside. Mrs Sukumaran pleaded for President Joko Widodo to spare her son and Chan. 'Please don't kill them, they are good children,' she said. Brintha cried as she begged for her older brother's life. 'Please don't kill my brother, please,' she said. 'He's rehabilitated and we love him so much. 'Please don't kill him, please. Please.'

'No one is listening to us, it's not fair,' she said. 'We don't have much time and he's scared. I can see it in his eyes, he's so scared.' Earlier, expatriate Lizzie Love, who assists in Sukumaran's art classes, left the prison with one of his self-portraits and a portrait of a prisoner named Maria to be donated to charity. The Filipina is ill and Sukumaran's paintings are funding her long-needed surgery. Ms Love said it was one in a long line of kind acts for his fellow inmates. 'I just implore the president to please consider his position,' she said. Mr Joko is refusing clemency to death row drug offenders regardless of their rehabilitation efforts. Halen Chan, the mother of death-row prisoner Andrew Chan, leaves after visiting her son in Prison on Friday . Family members of Sukumaran leave the Kerobokan jail in Denpasar on Bali island on Friday . An application for a judicial review that would have canvassed Chan's chaplaincy efforts and Sukumaran's successful art school - as well as past errors of law - was rejected this week. But some of the inmates touched by the Sydney men have written their own appeals to Mr Joko. One of them, Richo Richardo, said Chan was a selfless man who had insisted on paying for his medical care when he had no money. 'If your honour Bapak President still insists on executing Andrew Chan, I, Richo Richardo, as an Indonesian citizen, am ready to replace Andrew Chan to be executed.'

There are already eight drug offenders in line for execution and he says he is waiting for 'more than three' others. Prime Minister Tony Abbott has promised to leave 'no stone unturned' in efforts to seek a stay of execution.

"Rick Santorum and his wife Karen have revealed the agony they faced when their daughter was born disabled and had a very low chance of survival. Bella was diagnosed with Trisomy 18 - a condition potentially more life-threatening than Down Syndrome - which doctors said is 'incompatible with life' and has a very low rate of survival. The former US Senator, was initially 'at peace' with whether his daughter lived or died right after his daughter was born, believing he saw her as 'less of a person'. He questioned whether he would love her the same as his six other children, while receiving pamphlets for coffins and grave sites as they left the hospital. But as the family prepares for her seventh birthday, they say every day is a blessing and have come to terms with the reality that they do not know how long they will have their beloved daughter for. Scroll down for video . Reaction: Rick Santorum pictured with his daughter Bella - who has the debilitating condition Trisomy 18 - was 'at peace' with whether his daughter lived or died when she was born . They have chronicled their story in a book titled Bella's Gift which is set to be released on Tuesday . The pair hope it may act as guidance for other families in similar situations. The Republican politician, who revealed the heartbreak surrounding his daughter's debilitating illness during his 2012 presidential campaign, told The Washington Post when Bella was born he initially thought: 'The best thing I could do was to treat her differently and not love her'. The youngster was released from the neo-natal unit and transferred to a hospice just 10 days after she was born - a paradox Karen described as 'painful'. Then, when she was strapped to gurney in an emergency room aged just five months, he had an epiphany. He added: 'I remember holding that finger, looking at her and realizing what I had done.' He admitted to The Post he had seen Bella as 'less of a person'. Support: The politician and his wife Karen are documenting the heartbreaking story of their daughter in a book Bella's Gift, set to be released on Tuesday . Preconceptions: When Bella was born the former US Senator initially thought: 'The best thing I could do was to treat her differently and not love her' Rick described how, because of the dire outlook, they were given pamphlets about coffins and grave sites soon after Bella was born while friends sent them letters of sympathy rather than congratulations. When he was putting together the crib, he told his teenage daughter Elizabeth to save the box, in case they needed it to send the bed back to the store - because they weren't sure . A doctor is also believed to have told the family: 'You have to let her go. Statistically, there's no hope here.' He also referred to her as a 'baby' rather than by name, . Only half of those born with the disorder survive a week and less than 10 per cent reach their first birthday. However Bella is nearly seven and her father has adapted fatherhood to life with her. Mr Santorum, pictured with Bella in 2011, described how one doctor told the family: 'You have to let her go' Karen describes how the youngster 'squeals' when she sees her father arrive home and now has him 'wrapped around her little finger'. She added that if Rick has another shot at the presidency, the family may fair better as the children are older and Bella's condition is more stable. However it is a mystery as to why she is still alive. He told The Post: 'Bella gave me the ability to talk about the dignity of every human life without talking about abortion, because there is a bigger issue. Rick added: 'Even if we don’t know how long we’re going to have Bella, we’re blessed. We’re just blessed every day. We don’t live on the edge. But we realize what we’re dealing with, and there’s all sorts of things that can happen.' Trisomy 18 is caused by an error in cell division, known as meiotic disjunction. All babies are born with 46 chromosomes - 23 from the father and 23 from the mother.  A trisomy occurs when the baby has three number 18 chromosomes instead of the normal two. Mr Santorum has previously said he often has to catch himself to stop from tears when talking or thinking about Bella. Mr Santorum has largely kept his daughter off the campaign schedules, preferring her to stay home with her mother.","Bella was born in 2008 with Trisomy 18 - a condition potentially more life-threatening than Down Syndrome .

"A middle-class couple who took to sleeping at Heathrow airport after losing their home have said they are ‘horrified’ by accusations they made up their story for money. The couple were delighted to learn an online donations page had been set up in their name by a stranger, the total of which now stands at £9,300. Hundreds of people contributed to the Go Fund Me page after reading of how Alan Lane, 71, and Katrina Smith had been forced to move out of their home in Poole, Dorset, after a string of poor financial decisions and bad luck left their savings and income chewed up by debt. Alan Lane and Katrina Smith have been inundated with offers of accommodation from kind-hearted strangers since sharing their story. The couple have been sleeping at Heathrow Airport after losing their home 18 months ago . With Mr Lane's adult children living 3,000 miles away in Canada, they have remained in the UK in the hope their luck would change. But for the past four months they have spent five nights a week in the airport. Miss Smith said she and Mr Lane were ‘horrified’ by one accusation in particular which alleged they were running a bed and breakfast in Staines, Surrey. The 62-year-old said: ‘It’s absolutely not true, of course it’s not. ‘We’re not running a B&B, we stay in one sometimes and it costs £50 a night.’ Miss Smith added: ‘We haven’t asked for anything but people have been so kind. Of course we wouldn’t have lied about this. If only they could be in my shoes to know.’ Since sharing their story in Saturday’s Daily Mail, hundreds of people from across the UK and abroad have come forward to offer assistance. Within hours of their story being shared online, the couple received more than £9,000 in donations from kind strangers across the world via a Go Fund Me page set up in their name . Miss Smith was moved to tears by the kindness of people offering their homes, while Mr Lane described their generosity as 'amazing'. Among the well-wishers to have offered to take them in is Christopher and Julie Nairn (right) who live in the New Forest . The fundraising page was set up by mother-of-one Natalie Longford. Miss Longford, who does not know the couple, wrote: ‘Let’s help them raise some money to get a deposit on a flat and turn their life around for the better.’ Less than 24 hours later, £9,270 had been raised by other generous readers touched by the couple’s story. The fund was closed to new donations at that amount last night, with Miss Longford posting: 'I do feel that far more money was raised than anticipated and that should be more than enough to help anyone get on their feet.' The couple have also been inundated with offers of places to live and are due to stay for free in a self-contained flat in the New Forest for a month. The flat is owned by Julie Nairn, 63, a volunteer who works with the elderly and lonely, who said she felt obliged to help the pair, as their situation ‘could happen to anyone’. A single foster carer who lives near Heathrow in Southall, also said they could stay in her spare bedroom ‘for as long as they need’. The couple were living in Poole, Dorset, before becoming overwhelmed by debt. Neither has signed on to benefits, but their monthly income is not enough to allow for rent and loan repayment . The couple were forced to move out of their home in Dorset (above).

They have been living hand-to-mouth since, at first staying with friends and family, but when the offers dried up, they began spending nights in Heathrow’s different terminals. They do have a limited income, but say it is not enough to cover their debts, rent and the cost of keeping their belongings in storage. During the day they spend hours searching the internet for work in free Wifi zones. While Heathrow has a group of dedicated social workers offering support to people found sleeping rough in its terminals, no one from the team has approached the couple.","Katrina Smith, 62, and Alan Lane, 71, lost their Dorset home 18 months ago .

"A man has died and seven people were injured after a bus crashed in a deluge of near-boiling water which had flooded the streets of a Swedish city. A cloak of thick stream shrouded the centre of Lund on Friday evening, after gallons of 88C water burst out from a broken heating pipe and swamped the city centre. The reduced visibility is believed to have caused a bus driver to lose control of his vehicle and plough into a group of pedestrians, including the man who died. A burst heating pipe caused a deluge of near-boiling water to flood the streets of Lund, Sweden on Friday . The water, which was said to be about 88C, caused the city to become shrouded in a cloak of thick steam . Witnesses reported seeing the vehicle careering down the street with sparks flying from underneath, believed to have been caused by a crushed bicycle. It was later confirmed that one man died while a further seven people were treated for minor injuries at Skåne University Hospital. Police are still investigating whether the bus crash and the flooding were linked. The emergency services believe the source of the leak was a fractured district heating pipe. Nils Norling at Skåne police told Swedish website The Local: 'When you see a bus approaching careering in that manner and hear people screaming and see somebody lying in one place and someone lying in another, then it all becomes rather overwhelming.' He added: 'Units have reported almost zero visibility.' The crash was reported to police at around 7.15pm, an hour after the flooding began. Officers cordoned off the area while investigations took place. The reduced visibility is believed to have caused a bus driver to lose control and drive his vehicle into a group of pedestrians. Pictured: Workers try to fix the heating pipe which had burst . Police are still investigating whether the bus crash and the flooding were linked, but said the incident had been 'rather overwhelming' Meanwhile, local residents were seen using wooden pallets to walk precariously down the flooded streets to avoid  burning themselves. Witness Lina Aspegren told the TT news agency said: 'I don't know what I can say. It is totally crazy. There is water everywhere. It's unreal.' Energy firm Kraftringen also posted on its website: 'We ask you to be very attentive to the water from the district heating leakage and avoid coming into contact with this as it has a temperature of 88 degrees'.

"North Carolina officer Josh Lefevers shot and killed James Allen, 74, just before midnight on Sunday morning . A North Carolina officer shot dead a 74-year-old man whose concerned family had called the police and asked to check on him. Officer Josh Lefevers arrived at the home of James Allen just before midnight on Sunday morning and announced he was entering the residence when Allen approached him with a handgun and refused to put it down, police said. Lefevers then shot and killed him. The officer first went to Allen's home around 10pm after relatives called the Gastonia police for a welfare check but there was no answer at the door, according to the Gaston Gazette. Officials called nearby hospitals but could not locate Allen. Neighbors said they hadn't seen him since Friday, and his car was parked at home. Allen had just recently undergone a medical procedure and his family was concerned for his well-being. Police then called the local emergency services and fire department to assist with what they believed was a possible death inside the house. After another knock went unanswered the fire department helped Lefevers enter through the back door of Allen's home. Gastonia Police Chief Robert Helton said officers were concerned Allen was inside and 'in need of emergency assistance.' Lefevers announced he was entering the house and then saw Allen pointing the gun at him, Helton said. Lefevers was hired by the department in 2012 and serves on the patrol division. Lefevers first knocked on Allen's door (pictured) at 10pm but there was no answer. Police then contacted the fire department to help them enter the house because they feared Allen might need 'emergency assistance'","Officer Josh Lefevers killed James Allen .

"Members of Pope Francis' sex abuse commission have sharply criticised his remarks that it is fine for parents to smack their children as punishment for misbehaving. The Pope has said parents should punish their children, 'do the right thing, and then move on,' as he acted out the movement of smacking a child on the bottom. However, the commission said there is no place for physical discipline and that it would be making recommendations to the pope about protecting children from corporal punishment. Naughty or nice: Pope Francis kisses a baby as he leaves at the end of his weekly general audience, where he told the crowd that it is fine for parents to smack their children as punishment for misbehaving . The pontiff made the remarks in front of a large crowd during his weekly general audience in St Peter's Square on Wednesday. Addressing the crowd, Pope Francis recalled a conversation he had had with a father who had admitted to him that he would sometimes hit his children as punishment. 'One time, I heard a father say, ""At times I have to hit my children a bit, but never in the face so as not to humiliate them"",' the Pope said according to the Telegraph. 'That's great. He had a sense of dignity. He should punish, do the right thing, and then move on.' Commission member Peter Saunders, who was sexually abused by a priest as a teen, said the committee would recommend that the pope revise his remarks, given that 'millions of children around the world are physically beaten every day'. Papa Francesco: Pope Francis is presented with a football jersey reading his name from FC Barcelona soccer club president Josep Maria Bartomeu on Thursday . Nice gift: Pope Francis shakes hands with FC Barcelona soccer club president as he leads a meeting for the 4th World Congress of Educational Scholas Occurrentes in the Synod hall at the Vatican . 'It might start off as a light tap, but actually the whole idea about hitting children is about inflicting pain,' Mr Saunders told a press conference. 'That's what it's about and there is no place in this day and age for having physical punishment, for inflicting pain, in terms of how you discipline your children.' Another commission member, Dr Krysten Winter-Green, a New Zealand native now working in the US with abused young people, said there was no type of corporal punishment for children that was acceptable. 'There has to be positive parenting, in a different way,' she said. The commission met with its full 17 members for the first time this week and announced progress today on drafting policies for holding bishops accountable when they cover up for paedophile priests. It will also be organising educational seminars for Vatican officials and bishops on protecting children from predators. This week, Pope Francis sent a letter to all leaders of the Catholic clergy, reminding them to cooperate with the new sex abuse  inquiry – even if it means uncovering more scandals. Pope Francis delivers his speech  in the Pope Paul VI hall, at the Vatican, where he addressed whether parents should hit their children as punishment . Popular guy: Hundreds gather in St Peter's Square every week for Pope Francis' general audience . In a strongly-worded letter to the heads of national bishops' conferences and religious orders, the pope demanded 'close and complete' cooperation with a new child protection watchdog he has established at the Vatican. 'Families need to know that the Church is making every effort to protect their children,' he said. 'Consequently, priority must not be given to any other kind of concern, whatever its nature, such as the desire to avoid scandal, since there is absolutely no place in ministry for those who abuse minors.' The Pontifical Commission for the Protection of Minors has been given a brief to drive reform on an issue that has severely damaged the Church's authority and reputation around the world. On Tuesday, the Pope apologised for offending large Catholic families by saying that there was no need to breed 'like rabbits'. The Pope caused dismay among larger families last month when he appeared to advocate 'responsible parenthood' advising that three children was 'about right'. Speaking during a press conference on a flight back from the Philippines, he said that 'Some think that in order to be good Catholics we have to be like rabbits. No. Responsible parenthood.' Vatican Archbishop Giovanni Becciu apologised on Pope Francis' behalf by saying 'the Pope is truly sorry' that his remarks about large families 'caused such disorientation'. Archbishop Becciu told the Italian bishop's newspaper Avvenire that the pope 'absolutely did not want to disregard the beauty and the value of large families.'","Pope Francis told crowd it's fine to smack a naughty child .

"The first hostage to escape from Sydney's Lindt cafe John O'Brien has told of his daring plan which saw him be the first to successfully flee the cafe. Mr O'Brien said he spotted a green button on the door at one of the entrances to the cafe, and asked one of the staff members if it worked. She said she was unsure. To make his escape the hostage had to squeeze between the door and an advertising sign, and had alerted lawyer Stefan Baloufitis to his plan. Without speaking he indicated to his fellow hostage how they would get out. The men knew if it failed, they would most likely be shot. When gunman Man Haron Monis was distracted, Mr O'Brien crawled along the floor behind the sign so he could reach the button. Scroll down for video . John O'Brien told Channel Seven how he plotted his daring escape from the Sydney Lindt cafe on December 15, 2014 . To reach it he had to squeeze between an advertising sign and the wall . 'They were the worst 10 seconds of my life, because I thought, if the green button doesn't open, then he'll probably come up and shoot us in the back,' Mr O'Brien told Channel Seven. 'And they were the worst 10 seconds, waiting for that green button to open. '(I) Pushed the button and, hallelujah, it opened! And that was a great moment,' Mr O'Brien told journalist Melissa Doyle. Mr O'Brien and Mr Baloufitis fled the cafe unharmed, into the arms of SWAT police. 'That was the most wonderful moment when I turned that corner and the SWAT team were just around there, 20 feet around the corner,' he continued.

Elly Chen and Jieun Bae were among the second lot of hostages to escape the cafe, and told of how Marcia Mikhael moved closer to the gunman to protect them. The pair met for the first time that day, as it was Elly's first day at work and Jieun had just returned from holidays. Jieun had to convince Elly to make a run for it with her, and they managed to unlock the door without being detected. From there they still had to open the door without a sound, which they managed and fled the cafe without Monis even being aware they were gone.

He told Channel Seven he had thought about launching at attack on Monis during the day but the reports he had a bomb and the thought of his 4-year-old daughter stopped him making a move. Mr Ankireddy was the last hostage to escape the cafe before the siege came to its dramatic climax just after two on Tuesday morning. He told the program he felt a rush of air pass his head as he fled, which he believed to be a gunshot. 'I felt that rush of air just passing so fast next to my head. I ran and then I fumbled over on the foyer, which is between the Lindt Cafe and another building, and then we just ran away there,' Mr Ankireddy said.

The couple met through friends after the breakdown of the actress' 23-year relationship with ex-fiancé Geoff Knights in 2009 and have been together since 2012. The actress, best known for her role as Kathy Beale in EastEnders, started dating the former stockbroker just a few years after he served time for importing one of the biggest ecstasy hauls ever seized in the UK. He was sentenced to 15 years in prison in 2003, after being found guilty of plotting to import and supply Class A drugs at Bristol Crown Court, but served just seven years of his sentence. At the time of the court case, it was the biggest drugs raid in history after police found 839,500 ecstasy tablets worth an estimated £7.5million. Last week she went public about Fairbairn's prostate cancer treatment. The revelation comes just 15 months after her ex-partner Knights died from the disease.

"Found dead: Kalbir Dhillon, 44, was discovered in the water near San Francisco airport in January . A woman found dead, floating face-up in the San Francisco Bay after vanishing from her home is yet to be given a cause of death, distressing her grieving family and prompting a hunt for the truth. Kalbir Kaur Dhillon, 44, had reportedly been arguing with her husband on the night of January 17, when she took off in her silver Mercedes. Her car was found in the parking lot of the parking lot of the Marriott hotel just outside San Francisco airport. Joggers found her body floating in the bay not far away. The spot is not far from the runways of the busy, waterside airport. She reportedly left her home in Fremont, California, after arguing with her husband. It is unclear whether that had anything to do with the death. Investigators recovered the body, and officials later confirmed her identity. But, according to community newspaper India West, her cause of death is yet to be determined. Officers also have yet to say whether the death is being treated as a suicide or a homicide, the paper reported. Local news station KRON-4 reported that police said there were no immediate signs of foul play. Dhillon, who was a project manager at Macy's, was born in Leicester, England, and grew up in California. She had two children from her first marriage. After her husband died in a 1996 car accident, she married again, to Bobby Dhillon, who had two children of his own. Mystery: Dhillon, pictured above left and right, had two children and two stepchildren. She was a project manager at Macy's . Found floating: Dhillon was discovered by joggers face-up in the San Francisco bay. Pictured is the parking lot where her Mercedes was found . Before the remarriage, in 2012, she had been a single mother for 16 years. Family members spoke of how she made sacrifices for her two daughters, who are now both college students. Writing on a Facebook tribute page, her sister wrote: 'Her work history shows her hard work ethic as well as her ambition to continue to grow and surpass personal goals. 'She faced numerous obstacles in life: the death of her first husband, raising two daughters as a single mother, and she pushed through it, and not once did she complain . 'She stayed strong with her upbeat personality and remained positive, always focusing on her goals ahead. My sister would never give up. She was the one to fight.' Fremont Police Department officers reportedly first told the family that Dhillon had only died very shortly before being found, based on forensic evidence. They later decided she could in fact have been dead much longer, raising suspicions. Found: Dhillon's silver Mercedes, above, was found in the parking lot of a Marriott hotel. Her body was discovered not far away . Distraught family members are now calling on police to investigate more thoroughly. Dhillon's cousin, Kalbir Pahal, told India West: 'Not knowing the manner of death or the cause of death is very frustrating for us... Things aren’t adding up; there are holes in the stories.' A GoFundMe page has been started to raise money for attorney fees to research her death privately. It has raised more than $10,000. According to family members, there were no signs of injury on Dhillon's body. Her husband told police he had argued with her before her disappearance, according to family sources. However, Pahal said she did not believe the accident contributed to her death. The GoFundMe page described her death as 'a complete shock to her family and friends'. It added: 'she showed absolutely no indication of being upset or having any issues in her day to day life.'","Kalbir Dhillon, 44, left her home in Fremont, California, on January 17 .

"A Utah mother-of-five has been isolated in her community and is receiving threats for not vaccinating her child. During the national debate over measles and vaccines, Ursula Porter, of Salt Lake City, and her husband, Mark, made it public that one of her kids has not been vaccinated. She said that four of her five children, aged two to nine years old, had been vaccinated and three of them suffered severe reactions. It's not clear which vaccine Porter's children reacted to - though the Center of Disease Control recommends a slew of childhood vaccinations. Most anti-vaccination advocates point a finger at the MMR triple shot - which vaccinates for measles, mumps and rubella. During the national debate over measles and vaccines, Ursula Porter, of Salt Lake City, and her husband, Mark, made it public that one of her kids has not been vaccinated . Porter said that four of her five children, aged two to nine years old, had been vaccinated and three of them suffered severe reactions . Her family started as a vaccinated family and it was something Porter and her husband were 'very confident in', according to KSL. But Porter said she saw dramatic changes in the health of her children and claims one child has suffered lifelong damages. Since telling people that one of her children is not vaccinated, other families have stopped inviting them to gatherings and play dates. Porter and her husband - along with other families in the community that have not vaccinated their children - have also seen an onslaught of online bullying. 'I’ve had people tell me that I should be reported to Child Protective Services for not vaccinating my children and for not taking care of them,' Porter told KSL. Daily Mail Online reached out to Porter for comment, but she did not return a message seeking comment. Porter and her husband - along with other families in the community that have not vaccinated their children - have seen an onslaught of online bullying. People even threatened to call Child Protective Services . Utah Department of Child and Family Services told KSL, however, that vaccinating is not required by law and that 'this alone would not meet the criteria for a child abuse or neglect investigation'. Porter added that if her kids are sick, she won't even take them to church. And now, because other families won't set up outings with her children, Porter's kids' only play with each other. She urged that her family has done the research and that the vaccinations simply don't work with her kids' genetic makeup. She wants her kids - and everyone else's - to be 'healthy, strong and not live with these diseases'. The movement of some parents refusing to vaccinate their children comes as the re-emergence of the measles sweeps the United States. Several state legislatures are debating vaccine-related measures as dozens of people have fallen ill from a measles outbreak that started at Disneyland in December and spread beyond the theme park. Many people who don't vaccinate their children say they fear a triple vaccine for measles, mumps and rubella is responsible for increasing cases of autism - a theory repeatedly disproven by various studies. Students at all ten campuses of the University of California will be required to be screened for tuberculosis and vaccinated for measles, mumps, rubella and other diseases under a new health plan set to take effect in 2017, the university said on Friday. Announcement of the policy change, which goes beyond the hepatitis B shots already required of all 233,000 UC students, comes amid measles outbreaks that have infected more than 100 people in California and over a dozen more in 19 other U.S. states and Mexico since December. Politicians and education and health officials at the national, state and local levels have found themselves suddenly reacting to the re-emergence of a highly contagious disease that had been declared eliminated as a U.S.-borne virus in 2000, after decades of immunization efforts. One of New Mexico's largest public school districts, Santa Fe, will start barring unvaccinated students from class unless they have a valid state exemption, the head of the school board said on Friday. The recent flare-up has spurred legislators in California, Oregon and Washington state to consider laws to make it harder for parents legally to opt out of vaccinating school-aged children. Bills in several other states, including New York, Mississippi and West Virginia, would loosen restrictions. U.S. congressional leaders and several possible 2016 presidential hopefuls addressed the issue this week, joining a renewed debate over parents' right to forgo inoculation of their children and fears about potential side effects. Several state legislatures are debating vaccine-related measures as dozens of people have fallen ill from a measles outbreak that started at Disneyland in December and spread beyond the theme park (file photo) The Santa Fe district notified parents this week that any students who lack up-to-date vaccinations or bona fide state waivers for medical or religious grounds will be excluded from class starting on Feb. 17, board President Steven Carrillo said. The district has not determined how many of its 14,000 students are unvaccinated or already exempted, he said. The district action comes as New Mexico documented a steady rise in vaccine exemptions during the past two years, up 17 percent from 2012 to 2014 to 3,335 children. State Health Department spokesman Kenny Vigil said waivers represent less than one percent of school-aged children statewide, though the department has voiced concern over the trend. Just one measles case has been confirmed in New Mexico this winter, an unvaccinated baby who was hospitalized in December and has since recovered, Vigil said. It was the state's first case since 2012. The origin of the child's infection is unknown, he said, but the case was unrelated to the California outbreak because its onset in late November predates the first Disneyland infection. California public health officials report 103 people have been diagnosed with measles in the state, many linked to exposure to an infected person from outside the country who visited Disneyland in late December. Under the UC vaccination plan, which the university said has been in the works for a year, all incoming students are expected to be immunized against measles, mumps, rubella, chicken pox, meningococcus, tetanus and whooping cough starting in 2016. But the plan will be strictly enforced starting in the fall of 2017.","Ursula Porter and her husband vaccinated four of five of their kids .

"A teaching assistant who slipped on a jigsaw piece has cost a local council almost £40,000 in taxpayers' cash. The case was one of 281 payouts made to teachers and assistants last year for injuries sustained at work. After slipping on the jigsaw, the Blackpool teaching assistant sustaining a fractured coccyx and suffered back pain. Blackpool council had to pay out almost £40,000 in taxpayers' cash after a teacher slipped on a jigsaw piece . Blackpool council (pictured) eventually paid the teacher £4,800 in compensation but it also had to settle legal bills for the case that had reached £32,000 . Blackpool council eventually paid the teacher £4,800 in compensation but also had to settle legal bills for the case that had reached £32,000. The study of town halls across England found that for every £1 in compensation paid to teachers, another £1 goes into the pockets of lawyers who often take the cases on a controversial no-win no-fee basis. This meant the total amount paid by local authorities amounted to £7million in taxpayers' money. The largest payout was £114,000, given to a teacher in Birmingham who developed a stress disorder after being injured when breaking up a fight. Another teacher in the city was handed £32,000 after slipping on ice, £25,000 was paid to a teacher injured when items fell on them from a store cupboard and two payments of £4,500 and £16,000 were given to teachers after projectors fell on their heads. Elsewhere, a young pupil crashed in to a teacher on a scooter, which led to Harrow Council paying out £24,000 in compensation. In West Sussex, a teacher received £2,500 after complaining chemical fumes had damaged their vocal chords, while another was handed £1,500 after saying they kept getting headaches when banging in to a faulty cupboard door. In Croydon a teacher was paid £1,500 after dropping a heavy table on their foot, £7,500 was paid to another who slipped on a manhole cover in the school grounds and £9,000 to an employee whose hand was crushed as they moved a cupboard. A fight between two pupils at a Plymouth school cost the local authority £53,000 after a teacher injured their arm trying to break it up . A teacher in Rotherham received £4,750 in compensation from being injured in a fall after a faulty handrail came away from the wall. The same council paid £2,000 to a teacher who slipped on some food that had been left on the ground. In Bromley, London, a teacher was paid £10,000 when they walked into a dark classroom and tripped over an extension cable. A fight between two pupils at a Plymouth school cost the local authority £53,000 after a teacher injured their arm trying to break up the brawl. In that case, the employee was paid £19,000 compensation, another £26,000 was paid to the teacher's solicitors and the council's own legal costs were another £8,000. Today, there were calls for an end to what's been described as a growing compensation culture. Andy Silvester, a spokesman for the TaxPayers' Alliance, said: 'Either schools aren't providing a safe environment or are paying out too quickly in spurious claims. 'This compensation culture is out of control and it is taxpayers who end up with the bill. We simply have to bring this figure down, because every penny spent on compensation is a penny that can't be spent on education.' Christopher McGowan, chairman of the Campaign for Real Education, said: 'The ""compensation culture"" is having a debilitating and disastrous impact on schools. 'Far from protecting youngsters or school staff, health and safety laws are robbing pupils of their childhood and encouraging adult school employees to join the dash for compensation cash. 'Many schools these days are so terrified of permitting any element of ""risk"" that contact play, outdoor activities, schools trips and foreign language exchanges are being restricted or banned. 'The latest evidence shows that the compensation culture has spread with a vengeance from claims by pupils to claims by school employees. It has become a compensation ""free for all"". Money that should be spent on the education of children is being lost to the law and to the lawyers.'","Teaching assistant in Blackpool fell on jigsaw and fractured coccyx .

"Esther Rantzen has fully embraced her new title as a dame by commissioning her own coat of arms . As the TV presenter known for introducing knobbly vegetables and talking dogs to the nation, Esther Rantzen admitted she was as shocked as anybody when she was made a Dame in the New Year’s Honours List. But now the 74-year-old has fully embraced her new title – and decided to commission her own coat of arms. The former That’s Life! host, who received her damehood for charity work, has been in contact with the Royal College of Arms about producing a design based on her long career. ‘I have asked them about how long it takes and the cost,’ she said. ‘The bad news is it could be a year and about £4,000.’ So while she waits, The Mail on Sunday has stepped in to create an idea of what it could look like, complete with a motto that reads ‘that’s life’ in Latin . When we presented her with the design, Dame Esther was delighted. ‘It is terrific and wonderful’ she said last night. ‘I’m completely thrilled, it sums me up. Sic Vita Est – I like that motto.’ Our version might seem cheeky, but it incorporates elements Dame Esther wanted for her insignia – even the big teeth for which she is famed. ‘I would like a blue stocking because of my Somerville College connection, a big pair of teeth, a phone for ChildLine, a knobbly vegetable and a talking dog from That’s Life,’ she said. The Royal College of Arms say there are no fixed criteria of eligibility for an official coat of arms, ‘but such things as awards or honours from the Crown... are taken into account.’ Dame Esther said: ‘I will put my crest of arms on the mantelpiece and maybe have it engraved on the windows of my house in London and the New Forest. ‘I don’t want to be flash but maybe I could have it on the bonnet of my small Lexus, like they do with a Rolls-Royce.’ A coat of arms is also a throwback to her first on-screen job in television. ‘The first thing I did when I worked on Braden’s Week in 1968 was research about coat of arms,’ she said. ‘So this has been a suppressed ambition of mine for nearly 46 years. It is wonderful. I would never have dreamed of it. And it is all because of ChildLine and The Silver Line [a similar helpline for the elderly].’ The Mail on Sunday’s highly trained heraldic experts (well, our in-house artist) created this crest with the motto ‘that’s life’ in Latin . Our crest for Dame Esther includes elements of her career such as her distinctive teeth; oddly-shaped carrots and the dog who said ‘sausages’ from That’s Life!; and a phone to represent ChildLine. Stockings represent her once all-female Oxford college Somerville; ‘bluestocking’ is an old term for an educated woman. She explained that the cost of getting a coat of arms was high ‘because it requires a lot of attention; it involves artists and craftsmen and it’s on vellum’. Vellum is traditionally made from calf’s skin, but Dame Esther said she wouldn’t want a coat of arms if it compromised her stance against animal cruelty. Speaking about adjusting to life as a Dame she added: ‘My children call me Dame Mum, and the shoe store LK Bennett call me Miss Esther Dame. Being called Dame is disconcerting. It takes some getting used to.’ She will visit Buckingham Palace to officially receive her honour sometime in the next six months but is concerned about how she will pull off a hat in front of royalty. She said: ‘I don’t know if it will be the Queen or Prince William. I’m more worried about what hat to wear. I look worse in hats than Cilla Black.’ Coincidentally, William’s in-laws, the Middleton family, got their own coat of arms just before the 2011 Royal Wedding.","Dame Esther Rantzen, 74, has commissioned her own coat of arms .

"Young men suspected of falling for the warped ideology of ISIS are being arrested at a rate of almost one a day, it has emerged. Scotland Yard assistant commissioner Mark Rowley said ISIS is unlike any other threat Britain has faced before in its bid to recruit and corrupt people. The national policing lead for counter-terrorism said  arrests were up 35 per cent as extremists try to radicalise 'misfits, criminals and the vulnerable'. Scotland Yard assistant commissioner Mark Rowley said officers were now making arrests almost every day to pick up extremists trying to radicalise 'misfits, criminals and the vulnerable' Armed police patrols have been stepped up in the wake of the Paris terror attacks, while Scotland Yard has issued a public plea for more money to deal with the mountains of electronic evidence involved in terror cases. Ministers urged the public to be ‘vigilant’ and warned Britain is at 'very significant risk' from a terror attack by extremists. Mr Rowley said the threat posed by ISIS extremists, including those returning to the UK after fighting in Iraq  and Syria, had led to a sharp rise in police activity. He told BBC One's Andrew Marr show: 'It's very different. We're making 35 per cent more arrests now than we used to in counter-terrorism. It's nearly one arrest a day. 'That comes out of the fact that we're not just dealing with a classic terrorist organisation organising plots across the world. 'We're dealing with a group that's trying to create what you might call a corrupt cult of people, of followers who will act in their name. 'They're trying to attract misfits, criminals and the vulnerable; and it's those people, not part of a bigger organisation, who may act of their own volition. That's the challenge for us – is to have good sight of them and be able to intervene with them.' In the wake of the terror attacks in Paris last month, armed police were deployed to sites across London including St Pancras station . He confirmed that emergency plans to cope with a terror attack in the UK have been changed in the wake of the Paris shootings because it was 'not everything we anticipated'. Around 600 people are believed to have travelled to Syria and Iraq from the UK since the conflict began and around half have returned home. Asked about the anti-terror unit's reaction to the Paris attacks, Mr Rowley said: 'In terms of our national firearms capability, we've asked is it strong enough? How's it placed? How's it organised? 'We've arranged to be able to deal with those sorts of events and we have some well-tested exercises and command and control regimes for working across the country on counter-terrorism. 'But you look at an event like Paris and you think not everything in that we anticipated, so we're going to have to make some refinements to our plans to improve.' He also shared Prince Charles's fears of how young people in the UK are being radicalised in their own communities. The prince's comments on Islam and Christianity were broadcast in an interview with BBC Radio 2's The Sunday Hour with Diane Louise Jordan this morning . The Prince said it is a 'great worry' that so many young Britons who are yearning for adventure and excitement are being radicalised by 'crazy stuff' online voiced fears about the 'alarming' extent to which young people are being radicalised. Mr Rowley said: 'That's the dynamic that worries us most of us all, is the ability of IS to reach in to communities. 'We've been making lots of appeals to communities over the past year asking them for increasing amounts of help and we've seen that, we've seen more information coming forward.' The police have recently strengthened their cyber resources, leading to 1,000 'unsavoury' posts a week being taken down. However, Mr Rowley said more money is needed to grow the anti-terror unit over the next year and discussions with the Government for funding are ongoing. 'We certainly need more money and that’s what we’re discussing with government at the moment,' he said. Last month chief constables across the country began reviewing how to strengthen the protection of their officers and the Jewish community in the light of the Paris terrorist attacks. The police have also been giving the public tips on how to spot a potential terrorist in a drive to encourage people to report suspicious behaviour. Leaflets given to commuters by officers this morning include six things which should set alarm bells ringing, including someone with a lot of mobile phones, vague travel plans or taking a keen interest in CCTV cameras. Commuters have been given flyers promoting the confidential anti-terrorist hotline, which advise the public: ‘Don’t rely on others. If you suspect it, report it.’ Leaflets given to commuters by police today include six things which should set alarm bells ringing and urge them to report anything suspicious to specialist counter-terror officers . It makes clear that specialist counter-terror officers should decide whether something suspicious is important and could help to prevent an attack. The leaflet adds: ‘Everyone has a role to play in helping to prevent terrorism. You can do this by remaining vigilant and reporting any suspicious activity to the police.’ It sets out six types of suspicious activity to report to police, including: . Someone noticeable behaving differently for no obvious reason . Someone with a large number of mobile phones for no obvious reason . Someone with passports or other documents in different names for no obvious reason . Someone who travels for long periods of time but is vague about where they’re going . Someone buying or storing large amounts of chemicals for no obvious reason . Someone taking an interest in security, like CCTV cameras, for no obvious reason . The direct appeal to the public follows an increased police presence in central London. The Metropolitan Police said the leaflets being handed out today were part of ongoing measures to educate the public and not a change in approach.

"A group of cannibal seals have been blamed for a mystery wildlife slaying which saw the bodies of 80 others wash ashore. Police launched an investigation when the carcasses of dozens of harbour seals first appeared on the North Sea coast five years ago with 'corkscrew' wounds on their skin. They were the victims of a batch of larger rogue grey seals, scientists have revealed, after previously blaming the deaths on sharks in Greenland. Predators? A batch of rogue grey seals have been fingered as the culprits of more than 80 seal pup deaths across the North Sea coast (file image above) The animals washed up in a sea colony near Blakeney Point, Norfolk, and in the waters of the Firth of Forth and St Andrews Bay, their bodies partially eaten. Investigators considered other factors such as boat propellers and other sea life before discovering the animals had been killed by the larger species . Keepers even watched one of the creatures killing five smaller seals at the Sea Mammal Research Unit in St Andrews. The animal left wide, slashed cuts known as spiral or corkscrew wounds on each of the victims. There are only two species of seal permanently residing in Britain. They are the Grey Seal and the Common or Harbour seal. Both spend much of their time in the sea but come ashore to breed and moult. The animals, which often co-exist in patches of water along the coastline, can be difficult to tell apart - especially when their coats are wet. Grey seals have a more distinctive face with hooked noses. They are also larger than the Common seal, with an adult male the largest land- breeding animal in Britain. 'Scottish Environment Secretary Richard Lochhead said: . 'The clusters of ”corkscrew seal” deaths were unusual and worrying,' said Scottish Environment Secretary Richard Lochhead. 'In common with many of the creatures that live in our seas, seals are animals that are loved by the public. 'It is very important that we understand what caused these unusual deaths and we now have important evidence that natural predatory behaviour is likely to be the main cause, rather than ship propeller injuries as we first thought. 'This provides some reassurance for the shipping industry . 'This information will help to inform regulators, developers and others enabling them to take it into account in their activities. 'Marine Scotland will continue to monitor our seal population for further injuries and any evidence about the causes.' More than 80 harbour seals and pups were killed in the slaying. The species (pictured above) is slightly smaller than the grey Seal .","Carcasses of  86 harbour pups and seals washed ashore five years ago .

"Every woman dreams their partner will take them to the dizzy heights and for Shannon Sabourin, that came true - literally. Her now husband Rossel Sabourin planned the ultimate proposal, high on a mountaintop overlooking a stunning lake in the remote Canadian Rockies - but all while enjoying a gourmet feast complete with white linen cloth and a bottle of Champagne on ice. Rossel then popped the question - and thankfully she said, 'yes', later describing the magical moment as 'an unreal surprise'. Rossel planned a mountaintop proposal to Shannon 9,000ft above Bow Lake in the Canadian Rockies . In June 2012 the pair were innkeepers at a lodge  and staff helped carry a table, food and chairs to the peak . Shannon described Ross's proposal on a peak of Little Crowfood Mountain as 'an incredible unreal surprise' The couple, from Winnepeg, Canada, who are now married, have unveiled the pictures of their breathtaking proposal in July 2012 to inspire other couples to make their engagements as special as possible. They took their first trip to Bow Lake in the Rocky Mountains in 2008 and in 2010 they became fulltime innkeepers at the Num-Ti-Jah Lodge in Banff National Park. Both outdoorsy and keen on hiking, climbing and caoeing, Rossel schemed to create the perfect engagement moment - with stunning photos to match. Shannon, who had no idea what awaited her at the end of their climb, wrote on Facebook: 'Never expected this reward after climbing to the peak!! What an unreal surprise!! I'm an incredibly lucky lady.' Rossel posted on his Facebook page: 'It was amazing and the view wasn't bad either!' He added, 'A special girl needs a special spot'. Despite the summer day, the pair were wrapped up in windbreakers and Shannon, a respiratory therapist, was clad in a woolly bobble hat. The newly engaged couple toast the surprise meal far above Bow Lake in Banff National Park . The pair feasted on cheese, crackers and Champagne during a magic mountaintop engagement . Marketing executive Rossel had a table, chairs, linens and a gourmet spread of cheese, crackers and chocolate - including glasses, an ice-bucket and stand brought to the top of Little Crowfoot Mountain. The couple then dined overlooking the stunning green-tinged water, with their table seeming to teeter on the edge of an almost sheer drop with nothing but snow-covered rock face between them and the the lake, 9,000ft below. Rossel also involved his friend, photographer Paul Ziska, who captured the breathtaking shots from different points on the mountain to get a sense of the sheer scale of the couple's tiny table perched on the mountain. Rossel and Shannon married in October, 2012, and the pair, who have a labrador called Pearl, are expecting their first baby.

"A 17-year-old boy who is an openly gay teenager has said he was forced to change schools after being given an ultimatum by the his principal to delete his YouTube videos in which he is seen with his boyfriend. Austin Wallis was told to find another school by his principal at Lutheran High North school in Houston. He was summoned into the office and given an ultimatum: delete the videos or leave the school. Scroll down for video... Devastated: A gay teenager claims he was forced to leave his high school after they gave him an ultimatum — either go back in the closet or find a new school . In tears: In his latest video Austin Wallis apologizes for the tears, stating 'this was an emotional video,' and adds, '…things like this should not be allowed in our country . 'He said that in the Bible, it declares that being a homosexual is a sin and we cannot have you promoting a sinful lifestyle,' said Austin to LGBTQ Nation. 'I realized that I don't want to be somewhere where I can be kicked out for being gay and being open about it.' Although the private school has the legal ability to decide who should be allowed to attend, Austin is querying whether the school's actions are indeed moral or ethical. Austin first came out in a YouTube post last August, and since then regularly vlogs about topics affecting gay youth, and activities and adventures with his boyfriend. Happy and gay: Austin Wallis, 17, runs a popular YouTube channel that focuses on his LGBT lifestyle. Six months ago, he came out publicly in a video posted to the channel . Cute couple: Since his coming out, he has posted numerous LGBT videos, with many featuring his boyfriend . Rules are rules: Disputing his account, the school's head, Dallas Lusk (pictured), said the school had a 'right' to expel gay students . Wallis said in a video on the situation: 'The gist of it was: I had to go back into the closet. Which means I had to delete all my social media, including YouTube. I had to erase my digital impact on the world. And he said I'll have to do that to stay at the school.' 'I think it's ridiculous that in this day and age you can be excluded from your own school for being gay,' he said to Pink News. 'When I came out I knew I was going to have bullies, and I knew people were not going to be OK with it. But I never expected it to be from the people who were supposed to protect you from the bullies.' He has since decided to leave Lutheran High North. In an emotional video posted last week, Wallis tearfully explained that he chose to leave rather than hide who he was. 'I had to leave all my friends, and all my teachers, and I don't want people to think I left just because of the social media,' he said. 'It was because I can't stay somewhere where I feel like I'm being forced into something that I'm not and where I feel like I'm not wanted by my own principal and head of the board. School policy: Lutheran High North reserves the right to discontinue a  student participating in, promoting, supporting or condoning: sexual immorality, homosexual activity or bisexual activity; or displaying resistance to support the qualities and characteristics required of a Biblically based and Christ-like lifestyle . Candy crush: The principal allegedly told Wallis that he had to go back in the closet, and remove all of his social media accounts, including the YouTube channel . School officials are not commenting on Austin's allegations, butpointed to a 'morals clause' in its student handbook. In a statement issued by the Lutheran Education Association of Houston, executive director Wayne Kramer said, 'We respectfully require students to adhere to these accepted values and moral beliefs.' 'Students have to make choices and decide whether their beliefs align with our community,' Mr Kramer said. Austin's family says they do not plan on taking any legal action against the school.","Houston teenager says he was forced to change schools because he posted video blogs on his YouTube channel about being gay .

"The N.Y. Sea, Vancouver Archipelago and London Bay don't exist - but they could be place names in future atlases as glaciers continue to melt. A Seattle-based urban planner has created maps of cities around the world showing the alarming results of what the world would look like submerged in water. Though the doomsday scenario in which all of the world's glaciers melt could be thousands of years in the future, it would make many loved cities - including Portland, New York and Los Angeles - unrecognizable. Coastal cities around the world have been affected by global climate change, melting polar ice and warming ocean waters that have had concerning results on rising sea levels. More worrying, the U.S. Geological Survey estimated that if all of the world's glaciers melted, sea level would rise by more than 260 feet. Scroll down for video . Seattle-based Jeffrey Linn, who has a background in geography and urban planning, created a series of maps of major U.S. and Canadian cities based on what the places would look like if all of the glaciers in the world were to melt . Linn uses open-source data to create his maps and puts his information together using a mapping program called QGIS. He then puts everything into Adobe Illustrator. The base cartography for the projects only takes him a few hours . Linn said the most fun - and most time-consuming - part of the project is the minute detail he puts into labeling the maps with humorous and relevant place names, including Ex-LAX and Hollywood Landing in Los Angeles (pictured) Depending on the city, Linn decides how much to rise the sea level. When creating his first underwater map, he put Seattle under 240 feet of water . Linn has created maps for eight U.S. cities thus far and is working on several places in the UK, including London and Leeds. No names have been added to his UK maps, yet, but his London map shows what the city would look like under 130 feet of water - or if half the world's glaciers melted . Jeffrey Linn, who has a background in geography and urban planning, has created a series of maps of major U.S. and Canadian cities submerged in water in hopes of giving people a new look into global warming. Though the extreme sea-level rise isn't expected in the near future, Linn has given names to landforms and bodies of water that could emerge if the flooding were to happen, according to Business Insider. Linn uses open-source data to create his maps and puts his information together using a mapping program called QGIS. He then puts everything into Adobe Illustrator. The base cartography for the projects only takes him a few hours. Depending on the city, Linn decides how much to rise the sea level. Some cities are completely submerged with a 260-foot sea-level rise, but to make maps more interesting he lowers the amount of water. In his first sea-level rise map, he put Seattle under 240 feet of water. But when doing New York, he only did a 100ft sea-level rise. Most cities become unique sets of small islands, inlets and landforms. Landmarks including Seattle's Space Needle and the Statue of Liberty in New York are washed away as the water level gets higher. Linn details the maps down to specific roads in some cities. The names he gives bays, islands and bodies of water often give humorous insight into cities and the places Linn has created, though he said this is what takes the most time. English Bay turns into Vancouver Bay as water spills over the streets and landmarks of the city. All that is left is a series of islands Linn has named Vancouver Archipelago . Linn hopes that after seeing cities, including Vancouver (pictured) with an extreme amount of sea-level rise, his maps capture people's attention about global warming in a new way . Most cities become unique sets of small islands, inlets and landforms. Landmarks like Seattle's Space Needle and the Statue of Liberty in New York are washed away as the water level gets higher . Like Los Angeles, much of San Diego (pictured) is expected to be almost fully taken over by water if the world's glaciers melt. The University of San Diego and Sea World both are submerged in Linn's map . In his map of New York, for example, the Upper West and East Sides, which have been completely submerged in water, have been renamed the Upper West and East Tides. He has created maps for more inland areas, as well, including Palm Springs, California, which he puts under 260 feet of water. The map shows Coachella Valley - where an annual two-weekend-long music festival is held in the spring - entirely underwater. Linn hopes that after seeing cities with an extreme amount of sea-level rise, his maps capture people's attention about global warming in a new way. His interest in the maps came after reading Always Coming Home, by Ursula Le Guin, he told Business Insider. 'The novel is sort of a future anthropology of California's Napa Valley, and in it she looks into the future and sees California Central Valley flooded by sea-level rise. Since then, I would often think about what the world around us would look like once all the ice caps melted,' he said. Linn has created maps for eight U.S. cities thus far and is working on several places in the UK, including London and Leeds. No names have been added to his UK maps, yet, but his London map shows what the city would look like under 130 feet of water - or if half the world's glaciers melted. Linn eventually hopes to put together a world atlas. The result of Earth's icecaps melting would be 'catastrophic to human civilisation and Earth's biosphere', according to Martin Vargic, an amateur graphic designer from Slovakia. More than 75 per cent of the world’s population lives below 300ft above the sea level, including the vast majority of all large urban areas. Linn has created maps for more inland areas, as well, including Palm Springs, California, which he puts under 260 feet of water . The map of Palm Springs shows Indio and Coachella Valley - where an annual two-weekend-long music festival is held in the spring - entirely underwater . Portland morphs into a series of islands, with the area's mountainous and high-elevation areas towering above the places flooded with water . As the warming gradually progresses, scientists predict that we will experience more and more extreme weather events. Hurricanes, typhoons and massive floods will occur more frequently and on a much more devastating scale. The world’s deserts will expand, engulfing areas as large as the entire continent of Australia, including Southern Europe, the Caribbean and entire southeast of Africa. ‘Although this scenario is extremely unlikely to happen within our lifetimes, the truth is, that climate is going to change sharply,’ claims Mr Vargic. ‘Unless we limit our CO2 emissions to bare minimum, Earth will be more than 4°C warmer in the year 2100 as it is now. ‘Such a rise in temperature would be destructive to environment and human civilisation as well.’ Scientists believe it could take around 5,000 years for temperatures to rise significantly enough to melt all the ice on the planet, but claim the planet is already seeing the beginnings of this. Over the past century, reports suggest the Earth's temperature has increased by around half a degree Celsius and, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), this has already caused sea levels to rise by around 7 inches (18cm). The largest concentrations of ice on Earth are found in Greenland and Antarctica but it is also found on exposed areas, on mountain tops and in other regions. The East Antarctica ice sheet, for example, is so large it contains around 80 per cent of all the ice on the planet and its size has protected it previously during warmer periods in Earth’s history. When Linn first submerged Montreal, he used 260 feet of water, but soon realized the map would be more interesting if there was less water. When he only rose the sea level by 130 feet, he formed Montreal Archipelago .","Seattle-based Jeffrey Linn created maps showing what cities look like submerged in hundreds of feet of water .

"A 17-year-old boy who was shot to death in a 'targeted attack' has been named by police as detectives desperately try to piece together his last moments. Kevin Wilson was found lying on a street in Wavertree, Liverpool, last night after being shot in the back at about 8.30pm. Emergency crews desperately tried to save the teenager, who is originally from Scotland but was living in Liverpool, and he was taken to Royal Liverpool University Hospital. However, he passed away a short time later. His next of kin have been informed. Police have launched a murder investigation after Kevin Wilson, 17, was shot in the back in the Wavertree area of Liverpool at about 8.30pm last night. Police said he died from his injuries after being taken to hospital . Police have now launched a murder investigation into his death and are combing the scene for evidence. While officers are still trying to establish the possible motive for the attack, Superintendent Jenny Sims, of Merseyside Police, said they believe Mr Wilson was deliberately targeted. She said: 'We would like to reassure the local community that we believe this was a targeted attack and that incidents of this nature are still rare. 'We are not prepared to allow the close work we have developed with the community to be disrupted. 'The community and partner agencies have worked hard with Merseyside Police to endeavour to eradicate firearm incidents and we have seen a significant reduction over the last few years. 'I want to make it very clear that we are not prepared to tolerate these incidents and we will be taking a strong and robust approach against those suspected of being involved. 'High visibility patrols have been increased in the area and officers will be speaking local residents to help reassure the local community.' Police were scrambled to the scene at about 8.30pm following reports of a man being shot. Officers performed CPR on the teenager until paramedics arrived but he could not be saved. A police cordon remains in place at the scene today and officers said the road would remain closed for now. It is not yet known what the motive was for the shooting, but police said they believe it was a 'targeted attack' People quickly took to Twitter to offer their condolences to the victim, who was shot in the back, police said . Residents have taken to social media overnight to express their shock at the incident. Paige Cubbon wrote on Twitter: 'Thoughts go out to the family and friends of the lad shot dead on Smithdown tonight. 'Scary how real and close it is to my house. So awful.' Another Twitter user, Annie, said: 'Awful news - lad has just been shot on Smithdown Road. These guns need to be off the streets. Terrible.' And Johnpaul MacDonald said: 'Someone's been shot dead on Smithdown Road - only heard plod sirens out there the last couple of hours, mental night in Toxteth.' The road remains closed as officers continue to their investigations at the scene. It is expected to remain shut for the next couple of days, with a police cordon in place. Others took to Twitter to share news of the incident (above), which occurred at about 8.30pm on Saturday . Detective chief superintendent Karen Cummings, of Merseyside Police, said: 'The investigation is in its early stages and extensive inquiries are being carried out to establish any potential motive and to identify those responsible. 'I would urge anyone who saw anything, or who has any information which could help us with our inquiries to contact us urgently. 'You may not think that the information you have is significant but it could help us with our inquiries in relation to either of these incidents.' A post mortem examination is due to be carried out in due course to determine the official cause of death. Anyone with information should contact the Matrix Serious Organised Crime team on 0800 230 0600.","Teenager shot in the back in Liverpool named by police as Kevin Wilson .

"Karin  Ward, 56, is facing a High Court trial for accusing Freddie Starr of 'groping her', according to court documents . A Savile abuse victim has slammed the BBC and ITV for 'leaving her on her own' as she faces a £300,000 defamation claim brought by Freddie Starr. Karin Ward, 56, is facing a High Court libel trial over accusations that comedian Starr 'groped her and called her a '***less wonder' when she was just 15', according to court documents. The mother-of-seven, who is recovering from cancer, claims she felt pressured into giving a taped interview with Newsnight in 2011 when she was 'vulnerable' and believed she was dying from the disease. 'The BBC turned up uninvited in my life when I was very vulnerable, suffering from cancer and asked for my help to make their programme,' the mother from Oswestry, Shropshire told MailOnline. 'This involved raking up extremely painful memories of sexual abuse by Jimmy Saville when I was a schoolgirl. 'I felt pressurised to do so, thought I was dying from cancer and so eventually agreed to take part. I would never have done so if I had known that I could be sued, that they would not support me and I was on my own in all this.' But the Newsnight report was shelved and her claims were aired on Panorama 11 months later, despite producers not asked her permission. Ms Ward also claimed that Newsnight told her they would not identify Freddie Starr in the Newsnight programme, but 'Panorama ignored this'. Starr, 72, is now suing Ms Ward for damages over her allegations that he ‘groped the defendant’s breasts and backside and called her a ***less wonder while in Jimmy Savile’s dressing room after a show called Clunk Click in 1974’, according to the defamation claim form. The action centres on words spoken by Ms Ward and broadcast by BBC, ITV and ITN News in 2011. Starr - who has not been charged over allegations of historic sexual abuse - is seeking £300,000 to cover lost theatre bookings as well as an injunction to stop Ms Ward repeating the allegations. Both the BBC and ITV have refused to cover Ms Ward's legal costs – despite the fact that she was an interviewee for their programmes. Scroll down for video . Ms Ward is seen wearing yellowing sitting behind Starr during an appearance on BBC TV show Clunk Click in 1974, hosted by Jimmy Savile . According to the court papers, in November 2011 Ms Ward told BBC journalist Liz MacKean: 'That's when the other guests on the show would come in, generally after the show had finished, they would come in and they clearly saw girls and, well, kids, male and female, as there to be used. 'I had a famous person who would try, he smelled awful, he smelled of sweat and alcohol and it made me heave just to be near him, so I certainly didn't want him to do anything to me.' Ms Ward said: 'If you are a contributor on a TV documentary made by the BBC or ITV/ITN you should be in no doubt that if you get sued, you will be on your own and they will not help you. 'You have no control over what they choose to include and you then find yourself in the position of having to defend their journalism on your own.' The mother, whose testimony helped expose Jimmy Savile, added: 'It's absolutely disgraceful. Nobody in their right mind should take part in a TV documentary, even one where you think you are doing the right thing like exposing Jimmy Savile.' Starr - who has not been charged over allegations of historic sexual abuse - is seeking £300,000 to cover lost theatre bookings . Her lawyer Mr Price said: 'Ms Ward has been sued for the Panorama programme, but she did not give permission for the interview to be broadcast. Starr - who has not been charged over allegations of historic sexual abuse - is seeking £300,000 to cover lost theatre bookings . 'The footage was initially taken for the Newsnight programme, but she did not say it could be used for another programme a year later.' The mother also spoke on camera in the ITV documentary that brought Savile's abuse to public attention - Exposure: The Other Side of Sir Jimmy Savile. The defamation claim also cites in the on-camera interview with ITN that Ms Ward said: 'I was horribly, horribly humiliated by Freddie Starr who had a bad attack of wandering hands and had groped me and I didn't like him because he smelled like my step-father and it frightened me and freaked me out and I rebuffed him and he humiliated me in front of everyone in the dressing room.' Starr, 70, initially denied appearing on the show or meeting her. But when footage emerged showing her standing behind him on Clunk Click, he was forced to admit he was 'mistaken' but still denied the 'awful allegation' of abuse. ITV/ ITN are also not planning to cover Ms Ward's court costs. Karin Ward was just one of the hundreds of Jimmy Savile victims who came forward to tell police about his crimes . Ms Ward has even claimed that ITV/ ITN was not even willing to provide the information and documents she asked for to help defend the libel case. Starr – who has not been charged over allegations of historic sexual abuse following a thorough police investigation – is proceeding with a legal claim accusing Ms Ward of defaming him. A 10-day libel trial is expected to take place in June or July. The case against the comedian was dropped in May last year after prosecutors said there was insufficient evidence to support the claims of 13 women that he molested them up to 40 years ago. A BBC spokesperson: 'We wouldn't comment on individual legal cases but we note that following ITN's programme these allegations were repeated across the media, including extensively in the Daily Mail.'

"As the leadership challenge in recent days has caused speculation on whether Malcolm Turnbull will soon hold the top job, Foreign Minister Julie Bishop and partner David Panton showed what appeared to be a united front when they met up with the potentially new Prime Minister. The couple were seen leaving Sydney Airport on Sunday morning and later arrived with the Communications Minister at a Liberal Party fundraiser in Woollahra, eastern Sydney. The trio appeared relaxed until Mr Panton became caught up in the media scrum at the event which prompted Mr Turnbull to shout 'where's David' before reaching out to save him. This came just hours after Prime Minister Tony Abbott moved the spill motion forward 24 hours to Monday shortly after Mr Turnbull refused to rule himself out of the leadership challenge. Scroll down for video . Foreign Minister Julie Bishop and partner David Panton pictured at Sydney Airport on Sunday morning . The couple were heading to a Liberal Party fundraiser in the midst of a leadership challenge . The couple arrived at the event with Malcolm Turnbull, who could be the new Prime Minister of Australia by Monday . Ms Bishop was first seen with Mr Panton at the Melbourne Cup in November but after admitting they were an item, she later turned around and denied it. The Foreign Minister said she and Mr Panton were 'just friends', trying to end suggestions that she and the businessman were in a relationship. But since then, the couple - who've been dating for about 10 months - have attended events together including the Portsea Polo near Melbourne last month. Intensely private when it comes to her personal life, Ms Bishop, who was married to Perth property developer Neil Gillon from 1983 to 1988 revealed Mr Panton is 'supportive'. But she said she doesn't include him in any of her day-to-day work, saying, 'I don’t expect other people to get involved in my job but it’s nice to have support.' After divorcing her husband in 1988 she dated former Lord Mayor of Perth Dr Peter Nattrass for at least 12 years before stepping out with Mr Panton. The smiley trio appeared relaxed while the media were sent into a frenzy as they arrived together at the fundraiser . At one point, a media scrum engulfed Mr Panton and prompted Mr Turnbull to shout 'Where's David?' before reaching out to save him . Ms Bishop was first seen with Mr Panton at the Melbourne Cup in November (left) and also together at the Portsea Polo near Melbourne last month . The couple's attendance at this morning's fundraiser with Mr Turnbull comes as Mr Abbott has moved the spill motion forward 24 hours to Monday. This was shortly after Mr Turnbull refused to rule himself out a leadership challenge. Businessman David Panton was previously married to his wife Karen. Together they set up Panton Vineyard in the resort town of Shoreham just outside Melbourne, the Sydney Morning Herald reports. They had three children: Sally, Laura and Matthew. Mr Panton's two daughters accompanied him to Flemington for day two of the Cup Carnival last year, where he made his first appearance with Julie Bishop. A property investor from Melbourne, Mr Panton recently relocated to the beachside Sydney suburb of Manly from the Melbourne suburb of Shoreham. Mr Panton's son Matthew lives in New York. 'The last thing that Australia needs right now is instability and uncertainty,' Mr Abbott said in a brief press conference held on Sunday morning. Mr Abbott said he wanted to deal with the spill line 'as quickly as possible' so the Liberal party can put the matter behind them. 'The only question for our party is do we want to reduce ourselves to the level of the Labor party in dragging down a first term prime minister,' he said. 'Now obviously I've been talking to many colleagues over the last few days and my very strong sense is that we are determined to do what we are elected to do - to clean up Labor's mess and to give our people the economic security and the national security that they need and deserve.' Mr Abbott asked the Chief Government Whip, Philip Ruddock, to call a special Party Room meeting for 9am on Monday February 9 to consider the spill motion. 'It is important to end the uncertainty at the very beginning of the parliamentary sitting week,' he said. 'The normal Party Room meeting scheduled for Tuesday morning will also go ahead in the usual way.'

"The elderly and disabled are being ‘put up for auction’ by local councils on ‘eBay-style’ websites, with care firms then bidding to offer them a bed. At least a dozen local authorities are listing vulnerable people’s details – including their age and what care and medication they need – before inviting bids from care homes in the area. The bidding is sometimes open for only a few hours, at other times it can last for two or three days. The cheapest offer often wins. Cattle market: At least a dozen councils are listing vulnerable people’s details – including their age and what care and medication they need – on eBay-like software and inviting bids from local care homes (file photo) Critics last night said the system was akin to ‘auctioning your granny’ and a ‘cattle market’, saying sensitive decisions about an elderly resident’s final years are being made by a computer programme that is only interested in costs. It also means the patient or their family often does not see the care home, and that those running the home do not see the patient before they arrive. One council has boasted of reducing care costs by almost a fifth using the system. The auction-style process allows councils to circulate anonymised details of individuals to a large number of suppliers who then bid in an online auction for the contract. As many as 100 providers can bid before the software produces a shortlist of the most favourable bids. Shortlisted bidders are then told where they are ranked in the process. Online: The system uses a software called SProc.Net, which has been devised by Matrix SCM, a company based in Milton Keynes which last year said it was in talks with 30 other councils . If they are in second position, they can adjust their bid – either by lowering the price or offering extra care services – so that they can move up to first. Councils say quality is the first consideration, but figures obtained under a Freedom of Information request show 92 per cent of care packages commissioned on the system over a six-month period were awarded to the bidder with the lowest price, BBC 5 Live revealed. Government adviser Ros Altmann: 'These eBay-style sites highlight the funding crisis for care' Ros Altmann, a Government adviser and independent expert on care for the elderly, said: ‘These eBay-style sites highlight the funding crisis for elderly care. It is awful. The idea of bidding for a person is just uncivilised. These are not parcels, they are people.’ Janet Morrison, chief executive of the charity Independent Age, said: ‘Do we really want to treat older people as a “product” to be bought and sold this way? We are concerned that older people’s needs will lose out to price as the main reason for selecting a home.’ At least 12 councils use the auction-style systems. They include Kent County Council, Devon County Council, Southend Borough Council and Birmingham City Council. Dozens more are expected to follow suit. Care companies bidding to offer a place have to state what services they can provide and at what cost before a computer system decides which company is the winner of the ‘contract’. Councils say the winning home is not forced upon patients, and that it is not always the cheapest bid that wins, with quality of care being the main consideration. Birmingham has been using an online auction system since 2012 and says it has reduced its spending on care by almost a fifth. It uses a software called SProc.Net, which has been devised by Matrix SCM, a company based in Milton Keynes which last year said it was in talks with 30 other councils. Radio 5 Live also found that in some cases in Birmingham elderly people were being sent to homes which won the online auction despite being ‘zero-rated’ by the council on its own 0-100 scale of care quality – where scores under 60 are ‘poor’. Les Latchman, chairman of the Birmingham Care Consortium, which represents care homes in Birmingham and commissioned the FOI request, said the system was forcing providers to offer lower and lower prices to secure the contract. Speaking out: Emma Knight said her brother James, who had learning difficulties, was one persona affected . ‘This reverse tendering is something that compromises quality and undermines ethical practice,’ he said. ‘If you are going to keep lowering the price, something has got to give.’ Mike Gimson, chairman of Moundsley Healthcare Group, said: ‘It’s an absolute disgrace what is going on in Birmingham. It is more like Hereford cattle market than it is a caring service for the elderly.’ A Birmingham council spokesman said: ‘The well-being of all our service users is paramount and we only award care packages to providers who are able to demonstrate that they can meet the needs of individuals.’ Another critic of the system is Emma Knight, whose brother James, 46, has learning difficulties and had lived in the same care home in Exeter for 28 years. When it closed, Devon County Council circulated his details by emails to care homes which were then invited to bid to offer him a place. The details on the email included information about his ‘mood and well-being’ and medication. His family say other information which could easily identify him was also included. Miss Knight, 44, of Ottery St Mary, said: ‘We had no idea his details were being shared. This sort of tendering should be stopped.’","At least a dozen local authorities are listing vulnerable people's details .

Hassinger told the New York Daily News: 'For more than two years now, my family and the other families of Sandy Hook have been dealing with conspiracy theorists. 'They harass us, saying it was all a hoax. They accuse us of being in on the hoax a lot of the time. So it’s really so disappointing to see someone who is supposed to be an American role model come out and promote the Sandy Hook hoax theory.' She added the post prompted other Twitter users to abuse the families of victims. Jones' remark was likely based on a since-debunked report on InfoWars.com that claimed FBI crime statistics show no murders occurred in Newtown in 2012. Twenty-six people, 20 children and six adults, were killed during the shooting. Shooter Adam Lanza also killed his mother and then himself in the violence. Jones' tweets have gotten him in trouble in the past. He also apologized for making an insensitive comment and suggesting the use of alligators to attack illegal immigrants in June of 2013. The career .304 hitter said he was just trying to be funny but did call the remark 'offensive' and 'distasteful' in his apology. Hassinger said conspiracy theorists claiming the massacre was a hoax have been harassing them for two years now . She then asked the apologetic athlete to visit a website dedicated to supporting families who lost loved ones in the 2012 tragedy .

"BBC bosses racked up a bill of £1million of fee-payers' money on 13,000 first class rail tickets in just three years, it has been claimed. New figures obtained under a Freedom of Information request revealed annual spending by the Corporation soared by £76,000 between 2011 and 2014. It came in the same period that BBC shows, including Breakfast and Match of the Day, were moved to new studios in Salford with many staff members commuting between Manchester and London. BBC staff have spent £1million on 13,000 first class rail tickets in the last three years, figures have revealed. It came in the same period that many BBC shows were moved to the new HQ in Salford, Manchester (pictured) The average cost of a ticket was £73, although the BBC refused to disclose details of another 205,000 rail tickets claimed back by staff, according to The Sun. Andy Silvester, a spokesman for the Taxpayers' Alliance, told the paper: 'It's time to hit the brakes on this licence fee funded gravy train. 'The £145 TV tax is a big hit for hard-working families and the corporation shouldn't waste it.' But a BBC spokesman said: 'Staff are permitted to book first-class train tickets if they cost the same or less than a standard rail fare.' The revelations came to light after the BBC struck a deal with ticket agents to allow staff to book first-class fares more cheaply, it is claimed. It comes after BBC bosses were also accused of racking up hotel bills of more than £3.5million in the first two years after the move to Manchester. The BBC said that staff are allowed to book first-class train tickets if they cost the same as a standard fare . The £224m Salford project was billed as a way to save costs and boost the BBC’s audiences in the North. But it has been mired in controversy amid claims some staff did not want to move, despite relocation packages of up to £150,000. In 2012 Gary Linekar was caught up in BBC travel controversy after it was uncovered that the Corporation had been spending more than £15,000 a year to cover his travel to work. After finishing each Match of the Day show, the presenter - who earns £2million - has a chauffeur waiting to drive him from the Salford studios to his home in London. The BBC also paid for the former England captain’s first-class train ticket from London to Manchester to begin filming each week. The Corporation and Linekar's agents refused to comment at the time.","Figures reveal annual BBC spending soared by £76,000 in last three years .

"Caught: Tarod Thornhill, 17 (pictured), has been identified as the gunman behind a shooting at a Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania mall Saturday night. He was arrested early Sunday morning at his home . The gunman accused of injuring three in a shooting at a Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania mall Saturday night has been captured and arrested by police. Authorities were able to identify alleged shooter Tarod Thornhill, 17, comparing surveillance footage with a picture of the suspect posted to Instagram just hours before the incident at the Monroeville Mall. It's believed that Thornhill went to the mall to target 20-year-old Davon Jones, who was critically injured, in addition to bystanders Thomas and Mary Singleton, 48 and 47. Though he is a minor, Thornhill has been charged as an adult with three counts of aggravated assault, four counts of reckless endangerment, two weapons charges and one count each of attempted homicide and causing catastrophe. He was taken into custody early Sunday morning around 3:15am at his home in Brackenridge. The shooting occurred on the ground floor of the Macy's store inside the Monroeville Mall. According to the police affidavit, Thornhill confronted Jones in the Polo clothing line area of the Macy's around 7:30pm and the two got in a verbal confrontation. Thomas and Mary Singleton were shopping in the same area with their son, age unknown, when they stepped between to the two arguing men to prevent a physical fight. That's when Thornhill pulled out a handgun and started firing 'indiscriminately'. Scroll down for video . Victims: Three people were injured in the shooting at a Macy's at the Monroeville Mall in Pittsburgh. Above, a picture of the scene . An adult crime: Thornhill has been charged as an adult for the shooting, and was arrested last night at his home in Brackenridge. Pictured above in two photos posted to his Facebook . A chaotic scene ensued as security tried to evacuate the mall and shoppers ran for safety. A huge police contingent swarmed the center and searched each store. The three victims were rushed to nearby Forbes Hospital where Mr Jones and Mr Singleton were last reported in critical condition. Ms Singleton was reported in serious condition. Thornhill initially fled the scene, but investigators were able to track him down several hours later using a picture posted to Instagram. In the image, posted four hours before the shooting, Thornhill was seen wearing the same outfit as the suspect according to surveillance footage. That outfit included a black hooded sweatshirt with white lettering inside a white box on the front, black pants, white belt, and black and gray Nike shoes with white laces. He is currently being held at Allegheny County Jail and is due back in court on February 18. 'Active': Police vehicles line up outside Monroeville Mall on Saturday night before Thornhill was capture . Investigation: Heavily armed police are seen leaving the mall after deeming it secure following a major search . Pennsylvania native and ex-NFL quarterback Terrelle Pryor tweeted that he was at the Monroeville Mall, a short drive east of Pittsburgh. 'Damn was just in monroeville mall and just saw 2 ppl get shot,' he tweeted about 7.30pm. 'They are letting guns go in there.' In late December, hundreds of teenagers gathered at the mall and several fights broke out. The fights caused local officials and mall administration to agree on a plan to increase security there. Weapons are banned at the mall, whose code of conduct specifically prohibits 'Carrying or displaying weapons of any kind except those carried by certified law enforcement officers in the performance of their duties.'","Police have identified the shooter as 17-year-old Tarod Thornhill .

"Wiltshire Police's Chief Constable Pat Geenty will not be allowed to retire until an investigation into alleged gross misconduct is completed . A police force has performed a major U-turn after its Chief Constable announced his early retirement while under investigation for gross misconduct. Pat Geenty said on Wednesday that he was stepping down in May from his role as Chief Constable of Wiltshire, three years before his contract was due to end. It appeared his decision had been accepted after the force released a statement with a glowing tribute. But after The Mail on Sunday raised questions, it was later announced Mr Geenty will stay in post until the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) finishes its investigation. Last night the IPCC said: ‘It is our view that Mr Geenty should not be allowed to retire while our investigation is ongoing and before the conclusion of any proceedings that may follow.’ Mr Geenty, 57, was appointed in January 2013 on a five-year contract. He is paid £144,799. Last summer he was reported to the police watchdog over serious allegations dating back to 2009 – when he was Assistant Chief Constable – about complaints made in respect of a sexual abuse case. In September, the IPCC said that Mr Geenty was accused of having ‘withheld information and misled the complainants’. At the time the chief said he was ‘shocked’ but would co-operate with the inquiry. However, early last week, Wiltshire Police said Mr Geenty had informed the force of ‘his decision to retire in May’ on Monday and thanked him for his ‘hard work’. Then, on Friday, after being questioned by this newspaper, the force issued a statement saying: ‘[Geenty] has committed to remaining in post until the ongoing IPCC investigation in which he is involved is concluded.’ Had the retirement gone ahead it would have angered Home Secretary Theresa May, who has just passed a law to stop officers escaping justice by quitting while facing disciplinary action.","Wiltshire Police perform major U-turn on Chief Constable's retirement .

"Grinning from ear to ear on the pages of her high school yearbook Kayla Mueller looks every bit the all-American teenager. The lively girl from the small town of Prescott, Arizona is smart, gregarious and enjoys a wide circle of friends. But on viewing these photos from her school years - obtained exclusively by Daily Mail Online - few would have guessed that years later this young woman would wind up in the hands of terror group ISIS. Aid worker Mueller was taken captive by the Islamic State in Allepo, Syria, on August 4, 2013, when she was leaving a hospital. Tragically, she is now the subject of grim world-wide headlines over fears the 26-year-old was killed during a Jordanian airstrike on the ISIS compound where she was held. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEOS . Tragic: Kayla Jean Mueller, 26, (pictured in her year book photo) is understood to be the last U.S. hostage held by the terror group, which had been demanding $6.6m for her release. They claim she was killed last Friday . Popular: Kayla, pictured in her year book photo with the school robotics team, was voted Best Personality . Ambitions: School friends told Daily Mail Online that Kayla wanted to travel the world helping people . The US Government hasn’t been able to verify the claim and her parents refuse to accept it until they have official confirmation. Some believe the claim is a cynical PR stunt concocted by ISIS commanders to cause friction between Jordan and the United States. But others fear Mueller will never return home to Prescott, a picturesque community tucked away in the Bradshaw mountains, two hours north of Phoenix. Daily Mail Online has been able to build a vivid picture of a young woman eager to help and serve. At school Mueller is remembered as the girl who wanted to ‘change the world’ and it comes as no surprise to former classmates that she joined an international aid agency, travelling overseas to a far-flung places. Friends at Tri-City College Prep high school in Prescott recall a ‘kind’, ‘big-hearted’ kid, who always did nice things for others. High-flyer: At school in Prescott, Arizona, Kayla was part of numerous environmental and volunteering groups . Memories: Kayla's school friend Liz Peters, 25, (left) said Kayla (right) was enthusiastic about volunteering . As a high school student in Prescott, Mueller received awards for her volunteer efforts with groups such as AmeriCorps, America's Promise and Big Brothers Big Sisters. She told the hometown newspaper, the Daily Courier, in 2007 that she was interested in world affairs and wanted to work with people in the strife-torn Darfur region of Sudan. The young humanitarian even conducted two silent protest marches in her hometown to raise awareness surrounding the issues in Darfur in 2007. She also wrote letters and placed calls to members of Congress to push for a change in U.S. policy. School friend Liz Peters, 25, said: ‘I am not surprised about the path she chose, she always wanted to help people. ‘I remember that she wanted to change the world, community to community. She was hugely in to the environment. ‘We worked on the envirothon together, a state wide competition which our high school competed in. ‘We put together a project on the black-footed ferret being re-released in to the wild. ‘Kayla loved science, her and the teacher, Dr David Somerville would go to Willow Lake and do water tests for pollution to make sure it was safe for the frog population.’ Peters also recalls Mueller being on the school robotics team, another venture run by her favorite teacher Dr Mueller. ‘We had a lots of disasters with a tennis ball cannon we were trying to build, but it was great fun,’ she recalled. According to the high school yearbook the robotics team came ‘second only to Canada’ with the machine they sent to competition. Mueller, who graduated in 2007, was also a member of the rowing team and the Science National Honor Society team. At school she joined the ‘Leo Club’, a club which empowers volunteers to serve their communities and meets humanitarian needs. In her graduating year Mueller was voted ‘Best Personality’, ‘Best Dressed’, and ‘Best Smile’ and several yearbook photos show her smiling with classmates. Plea from parents: Marsha Mueller (right ) - whose daughter Kayla (left) is an ISIS prisoner - and her husband wanted to negotiate with their daughter's captors rather than risk her safety with a rescue mission . Shocking: American officials said they were looking into the reports if Kayla Jean Mueller's death. The White House said it was looking into the claim but that so far there was no evidence that corroborated it . In the same yearbook Mueller quotes William Blake as saying: ‘No bird soars too high if he soars with his own wings.’ The teen lived with her parents in a home accessible by only one road in a rural area north of Prescott called Williamson Valley. Yesterday the road was closed off with Yavapai County sheriff's deputies standing by barricades and blocking the entrance to their street. After high school Mueller attended Northern Arizona University, where she became big in to activism. She travelled abroad, living and volunteering with aid groups in northern India, Israel and the Palestinian territories. She returned to Arizona in 2011, where she worked at an HIV/AIDS clinic and volunteered at a women's shelter. At the clinic, she took patients vitals, and helped with fundraisers and community outreach. Late that year, she moved to southeastern France and worked as an au pair while learning French in preparation for a planned move to Africa. But the plight of families fleeing the violence in war-torn Syria drew Mueller to Turkey in December 2012. She worked with the aid groups Support to Life and the Danish Refugee Council, assisting women and children who crossed into Turkey as refugees. She also made some trips into Syria to help reconnect family members separated by the fighting. ‘The reason she is over there is, she wanted to help people,’ said Kennie Crotts, a close friend of Mueller's mother for 26 years. ‘I just can't even imagine the heartache,’ Crotts, who knew of Mueller's kidnapping. ""I just knew she was going to be released.""' Speaking to the Prescott Daily Courier she said of Mueller's captors, ‘They just don't have compassion for anybody.’ Blast: ISIS released images of this badly damaged building in which they claimed Kayla Jean Mueller had been killed during an Jordanian airstrike . This graphic, shared on Twitter, claims to show the location of the building where ISIS allege Miss Mueller was killed during a raid by Jordanian forces . ‘She was always there with a helping hand,' said Nancy Birck, a volunteer coordinator at Northland Cares HIV specialty care clinic, where Mueller volunteered, who described Mueller as ‘very compassionate and loving.’ ‘She always had a smile on her face,’ she said. When a Northland Cares worker was killed in a car accident, Mueller helped plan the memorial. ‘The common thread of Kayla's life has been her quiet leadership and strong desire to serve others,’ according to the family's statement. She was recognized in her high school years as a National Young Leader and received the President's Award for Academic Excellence in 2007 and the Yavapai County Community Foundation Youth Philanthropist of the Year award in 2005. Family and friends said they were shocked when her alleged death became headline news on Friday. ‘When I saw Kayla's face on the news ... Oh my gosh, she's a beautiful person inside and out,’ Birck told the Daily Courier. She learned of Kayla's kidnapping about a year ago. ‘I just can't grasp it,’ she said. ‘For years, her parents have been wondering what happened to her. ‘I can't imagine as a mom what she (Marsha) is going through.’ Her school friend Peters, now a teacher at Yavapai College, added: ‘What has happened to Kayla is awful news. 'I'm sure everyone will be hoping it’s not true and she can come home.’ One thing is for sure, the town of Prescott is praying for Muellers safe return.","Kayla Mueller was an award-winning volunteer at school in Prescott, AZ .

"It was the highest jackpot for almost a year at $380 million. But once again, the Powerball has slipped through the fingers of the millions who played and prayed. Not one ticket bore the winning numbers 5, 10, 21, 34, 58 and the Powerball: 33. It means there will be a 19th consecutive rollover for the next drawing on Wednesday - driving the figure up to approximately $450 million. Unlucky: Nobody landed the winning ticket to take home $350 million in last night's Powerball jackpot . The overall odds of winning a prize in the game are approximately 1 in 32. The chance of winning a Powerball jackpot is one in 175,223,510. That has not happened since December 3, 2014. Regardless, people braced blisteringly cold weather across the country to lay their claim. Vendors credited 'brisk' ticket sales this week for the significantly increased jackpot, which jumped up $32 million since last Saturday's draw. Sue Dooley, the senior drawing manager for the Multi-State Lottery Association, estimated value of Wednesday's drawing will be $450 million. Hopeful: Vendors attributed 'brisk' ticket sales to the surge in value of the jackpot, which will now hit $450m . The huge jackpot is a return to form for Powerball, which has been known for its record-breaking jackpots in recent years. But the Powerball lottery has experienced a slump, with nearly a year passing since its jackpot total climbed above $300 million. Powerball's last major jackpot was in February 2014, when it climbed to $425 million. The jackpot - won by matching all five white balls in any order and the red Powerball - is either an annuitized prize paid out over 29 years or a lump sum payment. On Saturday, the one-time lump sum payment would have been $220.6 million. The second prize - won by matching five white balls in any order - is $1,000,000 paid in cash and any time a player matches the red Powerball, they win. Powerball tickets cost $2 each.","No ticket bore the numbers 5, 10, 21, 34, 58 and the Powerball 33 .

"The widow of astronaut Neil Armstrong has given a bag full of equipment used by her husband during the moon landing to the Smithsonian after finding it in a closet.

The first man to walk on the moon made no mention of his bag, stored in a closet in his Ohio house, for the more than 40 years between the Apollo 11 mission and his death, according to Gizmodo. Alan Needdell, curator of the Air and Space Museum, gathered a team of experts from the Apollo Lunar Surface Journal to go through records and confirm that that the items were genuinely from the historic mission.. The bag, known as a purse, includes the 16mm movie camera and 10mm lens that first shot Apollo 11's descent to the moon's surface through a window on the lunar module.

The items donated by the astronaut's second wife were supposed to be left behind on the lunar surface, according to the Smithsonian. There are records of Apollo 11's astronauts mentioning the so-called McDivitt purse, named in honor of Apollo 9 Commander Jim McDivitt, during their journey. 'That [is] just a bunch of trash that we want to take back — LM parts, odds and ends,' Mr Armstrong said after he and Mr Aldrin returned to the command module orbiting the moon. The astronauts estimated that it held ten pounds.were careful to account for the extra weight and its distribution within their craft. In one exchange Mr Aldrin tells Mr Armstrong that lunar dust on his suit may be rubbing off on the purse. Photos of Neil Armstrong show the late astronaut training next to many types of equipment he later kept in his closet, such as the power cables seen above . Neil Armstrong estimated that the bag of 'odds and ends' that he and his crew took back, which was found with power cables (left) and a mirror (right), weighed ten pounds . The 16mm camera, known as the Data Acquisition Camera, captured historic moments of the Apollo 11 mission, including Neil Armstrong descending onto the moon's surface . Mr Aldrin and Mr Armstrong were recorded by the 16mm camera planting the American flag on the moon in the shadow of their spacecraft . The most valuable object in the hidden trove of artifacts is the camera, which was called the 'Data Acquisition Camera' and mounted on the lunar module. It captured the astronauts climbing down a ladder to the moon's surface and planting the US flag. A mirror device found also helped the astronauts orientate the lunar module for the last 150 feet before docking with the command module orbiting the moon. Netting used to protect equipment from free-floating objects was also among Mr Armstrong's personal souvenirs. A relic of the small and strange intricacies of life in space, a cover for the lunar module's pressurized waste management system was also found. The items' use in the historic lunar landing, as well as their personal significance to the mission's commander, are thought to make them priceless. The 'odds and ends' that Mr Armstrong told mission control about included eye guards for a telescope (left),  a spare light bulb for Crewman Optical Alignment Sight (center) and a lens shade for the 16mm camera . Mr Armstrong was thought to have used the waist tether (left) he kept in his bag to support his feet during a short rest period before departing the moon. A cover of the lunar module's pressurized waste management system (right) was also found . Netting used aboard the lunar module was used to protect equipment from objects that may have been free floating around the cabin . Researchers from the Apollo Lunar Surface Journal were recruited by the Smithsonian to determine whether items, such as Mr Armstrong's helmet straps (pictured) were aboard Apollo 11 . Two different utility clamps were found in Mr Armstrong's bag. Clamp 738 (right) was used by Buzz Aldrin to secure the camera onto the crash bar so it could film the lunar module's landing . A collection of vintage photos from Apollo 11 are expected to fetch more than $750,000 when they are sold at auction later this month. The Smithsonian currently shows the camera and waist tethers, which were designed to keep astronauts secure if there were problems reconnecting with pilot Michael Collins in the command module and had to spacewalk back into their return spacecraft. The straps are thought to have supported Mr Armstrong's feet during a rest period on the lunar module. It eventually plans on displaying the all the recently-rediscovered  artifacts for the public. The museum currently displays many items associated with the moon landing at its Washington location, including the Apollo 11 command module and suits worn during the mission. Mr Armstrong died in August 2012 less than a month after undergoing heart surgery.

"Ryan-Morgan Freeman, 10, played football with a cannonball dating back to the English Civil War before the bomb squad was called . A 10-year-old boy played football with a cannonball dating back to the English Civil War before the bomb squad was called to blow it up. Ryan-Morgan Freeman found the 17th century explosive in a bramble bush near his home in Sinfin, Derby, then used it in a kickabout with his friends on a basketball court. But when the 10-year-old went home to show-off his rust-coloured find, his father Calvin, 31, feared it could be life-threatening and called the police. 'The thing was round so it just seemed natural to kick it. I thought dad was having a laugh when he told me it might be dangerous,' said Ryan. 'But when the bomb squad came and blew it up I knew I could have been badly hurt.' A bomb squad carried out a controlled explosion on the sphere in a safe area near Ryan's family home. Officers looked up the cannonball on the internet and decided it might have originated in the English Civil War era which started in 1642. 'Ryan and a couple of his mates played football with it for a few minutes on the basketball courts at the end of our street,' said Mr Freeman. 'Luckily the court has a sponge-type floor which absorbed any impact. Ryan bought it home to show me. It was rust-coloured and about the size of a mini-football. 'It had two holes in the top and 4kh on it. I'm not an expert but I know that might have been military markings so I called the police.' Mr Freeman, 31, his partner Kerry, 30, and their five children aged six to 13 were ordered to evacuate their semi-detached home. 'I asked one of the bomb squad if it was dangerous and he replied it definitely was,' said Mr Freeman. 'I think Ryan had a close escape. If he had been kicking it around on a concrete floor the thing could have gone off. 'The council keep the bushes where it was found in good trim so I'm surprised it hadn't been found before.' Officers looked up the explosive on the internet and decided it might have originated in the English Civil War era, pictured are cannonballs found at Goodrich Castle which are thought to have been used in 1645 .
