Ian McKellen has warned the death of repertory theatre means Britain will not longer be able to produce acting greats such as Michael Gambon, Judi Dench or Derek Jacobi. The award-winning actor - considered one of the finest of his generation - said we will not see their like again because the theatre system has become a 'desert'. He said his years in regional rep were vital in developing his talent and without that experience the current crop are unlikely to become great actors later in their career. Treading the boards: Ian McKellen, pictured, said his apprentice in regional rep was crucial to the development of his acting powers . Theatre: Ian McKellen is not 'snooty' about his film roles and is happy to be as famous for Lord of the Rings as for the famous production of Waiting for Godot, pictured with Patrick Stewart above . When asked if the current system could ‘produce another Sir Ian’ he said: ‘No. Nor Derek Jacobi, Mike Gambon or Judi Dench. I got better as an actor, and still I’m getting better. That’s only been possible because there’s always been work.’ The Lord of the Rings star began his career at the Belgrade Theatre in Coventry in the early 1960s where he trod the boards in Shakespeare, Chekhov and Agatha Christie. Now, he believes actors move too quickly into film and television. He told Reader’s Digest: ‘The situation is desperate. There are no [resident] companies in this country, not even the National Theatre has one. There’s a desert. ‘The danger is going to be that the current generation of actors won't develop into good middle–aged performers because they won't have been able to live from their work. ‘The strength of British theatre should be that these actors in their middle years know what they're doing and are good at it. Not rich, not famous, but making a living.’ Apprentice: Ian McKellen said without regional rep Britain will no longer produce actors of the calibre of Judi Dench, pictured with McKellen in production of Macbeth . Fame: Ian McKellen said he does not mind being as famous for his role as Gandalf, pictured left, as his critically acclaimed theatre roles, and even appeared as Mel Hutchwright in Coronation Street, right . He is not alone in his appreciation of regional rep - where a resident company perform a variety of plays, including classics and modern work. Judi Dench has also previously spoken about the benefits of learning and making mistakes on the stage in the early part of her career. Michael Gambon is also reported to have been advised by Laurence Olivier to take up regional rep. McKellen added: ‘Why do you act? You act for an audience. In the theatre, you're in their presence. ‘Film stars don't know what it is to have an audience. ‘You see some at awards ceremonies who can hardly make it to the middle of the stage, they're so nervous. There's a microphone so they don't have to project. And they read their words. ‘You see a theatre actor come on and it's, “Oh, hold on, there's a show happening”. ‘Hugh Jackman at the Oscars – that's a theatre man who happens to be a film star.’ Calibre: Ian McKellen said that without repertory theatre Britain will no longer be able to produce acting greats such as Derek Jacobi, pictured left, or Michael Gambon, right . McKellen found international stardom in the latter half his career, particularly with his roles in the blockbuster Lord of the Rings trilogy and X-Men trilogy. McKellen said he is not ‘snooty’ about the parts he takes. He said: ‘I've always had very catholic tastes. Tolkien and X–Men are both good storytelling. ‘They're not franchises about cannibals or mindless outer space visitors. These are epic tales that do more than entertain. ‘Millions and millions of people have seen Lord of the Rings. Of course I'm more famous for that than Waiting for Godot. Just because a piece of work has been seen by so many more people doesn't mean it's less in value. ‘I'd as soon see a pantomime as a revival of Shakespeare; it all depends if it's any good.’","Without regional rep, the current crop can never reach the heights of Judi Dench or Derek Jacobi .

A woman lost a staggering 6.5 stone after being hypnotised into thinking she had been fitted with a gastric band. Janice Rodgers, 46, tipped the scales at 17st 7lbs and became desperate to find a solution. When she researched weight loss surgery online she stumbled upon a website about a ‘virtual band’- a treatment that hypnotises you into believing your stomach has shrunk in size. Super slimmer Janice dropped a staggering 6.5 stone after being hypnotised into thinking she had been fitted with a gastric band . Although doubtful she decided to give it a go - paying £270 for a year’s worth of sessions with a therapist called Andrew Nelson. When she came to after the first treatment she was in disbelief the hypnosis had worked but gradually began to lose weight, slimming down to a trim 11st in just seven months after the treatment made her physically unable to eat unhealthy foods. She stopped eating junk food like . crisps and fried chicken and embarked on a two week plan of just liquids . and gradually introduced solid food over time. Janice . lost a staggering 12lbs in her first week and dropped from size 22 to size 12 in seven months thanks to the virtual gastric band. Janice spent £270 on the hypnotising course, which made eating 'normal' food impossible . She has since stuck to a diet of salads, fruit, healthy wholegrains and and lean, grilled meat and . still listens to mp3 recordings of her sessions to keep her motivated. Janice, a care worker from Manchester, . said: 'I had been overweight for 23 years, since the birth of my son, . and tried everything to lose weight. 'I signed up for weekly weight loss classes but any weight I lost I would just put straight back on. 'I started going to Zumba classes with two slim friends but by the end of each session I was gasping for air. 'I knew I needed to do something about it so I logged onto the computer and looked up gastric bands without telling anyone. 'I was shocked with the amount of websites I found, but among them was Andrew’s which mentioned a hypnotic band. 'After researching that I decided to book an appointment, the price was reasonable and I though I would just give it a go. 'I decided not to tell anyone because I felt like a fool but I was just so desperate to lose weight. 'When . I first went I thought it would be a load of rubbish and I felt no . different until I went home and tried to eat something but it felt like . chewing carpet. 'I thought I had better look at the eating plan, which was just liquid for two weeks and then gradually worked up to solid food.

I still . can’t believe I have reached a size 12 and I sometimes do pick up my old . size in the shops. The care worker physically can't eat unhealthy food anymore, she says it tastes like carpet . 'My partner, Steve Kirkham, is really proud of me.' Andrew Nelson said: 'The virtual gastric mind band is made up of cognitive behavioural therapy, neuro-linguistic programming, and mental preparation. 'The treatment begins with an initial discussion where I ask people to visualise themselves as they want to be and we talk about healthy eating. 'People eat for a variety of different reasons and once we have realised the cause I then put them under hypnosis and reaffirm what we have talked about.'","Janice Rodgers was 17st 7lbs and slimmed to 11st in seven months .

A pensioner suffering early-stage dementia probably spent two weeks trapped on farmland in his broken-down car before dying of pneumonia, an inquest heard. John William Davies, 78, suffered hallucinations the night before he disappeared and had probably become disorientated when he became stuck in a remote country lane. There was evidence that he was still alive a day or two before his body was found in the Nant-y-Moch area of mid-Wales.

"By . Inderdeep Bains . PUBLISHED: . 18:33 EST, 14 November 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 02:46 EST, 15 November 2012 . Homes across Britain are forcibly having water meters installed to meet government targets to cut water usage. Water companies are now launching a massive programme of installing compulsory water meters across areas prone to water shortage -including much of southern England. The step, which amounts to rationing by price, could also be enforced across the rest of the country and could mean soaring bills for millions of families. The Government hopes introducing water meters into British homes will ease 'serious water stress' in key regions . Last year the Government classed the South East as a region of 'serious water stress', where water companies were granted the power to make metered households compulsory. Now Southern Water has announced plans to put a total of 500,000 meters in homes across Hampshire, Sussex and Kent by 2015 as drought conditions continue. This week, the company announced some 75,000 meters will be placed in homes in Brighton and Hove over the next year. The move by water companies is an attempt to meet government targets to cut average water use from 148 to 130 litres per person per day by 2030. Those who use the highest levels of water will be worst affected. This includes large families, the disabled and those who regularly water large gardens or wash their cars. However, those who tend to use less, such as the elderly and those who live alone, could see their bills reduced. The cost of installing a meter runs to £200 per house, a sum likely to be passed on to consumers. Around 40 per cent of homes in England and Wales are already metered, which means more than half the population has no connection between the amount of water they use and the size of their bills. The current system sees each household without a meter pay a fixed annual sum for their water based on their home's rateable value. Those with a meter pay just for the water they use. It is expected that 80 per cent of households in England will pay for water using a meter by 2020. Darren Bentham, Southern Water's director of metering, said: 'As well as helping to secure water resources for the future, metering is the fairest way to charge as people pay for what they use. 'It puts people in control of their bills.' More than 70,000 meters have already been installed in West Sussex since 2010 as part of the company's five-year plan. The Kent countryside is one of the areas targeted by the recent plans by Southern Water to introduce 500,000 new meters by 2015 . Since the equipment was rolled out, 59 per cent of customers reported a reduction in their water bills, while 41 per cent saw an increase. 'Which?' warns that households with large families could be hit by soaring bills. A spokesman said: 'While some can and do save money from meters, others - particularly large families - may see their bills rise if meters become compulsory. 'We want to see water companies and regulators considering the impact on all customers before making sweeping changes to the charging system.' An 2009 independent report by regulator Anna Walker called on the industry regulator Ofwat to drive through the introduction of meters through England, starting in those areas in the South East which are considered a future drought risk. The report says: 'A combination of significant population growth, the effects of climate change and the need to renew what is often Victorian infrastructure will put increasing pressure on both the availability and the cost of water. 'We need to tackle these challenges now, before they become major problems. The charging system can play an important role in this.'","Southern Water to put a total of 500,000 meters in homes in Hampshire, Sussex and Kent by 2015 .

An oil executive  who was found dead inside his burning SUV had smoked marijuana with the two men who allegedly murdered him, according to authorities. Robert Dodson, 44, was found robbed, hogtied with metal cable and strangled with an electrical cord last month. Dean Walden and Joseph Dodson (no relation) face murder charges over his death. The victim had become  increasingly paranoid ever since a 17-year-old girl was killed at his Texas home in June, during a botched attempt to stage her own kidnapping. Charged with murder: Joseph Dodson, left, and Dean Walden, right, face murder charges over the death of Robert Dodson . Walden, 47, told police that he and 31-year-old Joseph Dodson loaded the body of Robert Dodson into his own car and set it alight near a natural gas site in Fort Worth, Texas, according to the Star-Telegram. Firefighters discovered Mr Dodson's body when they went to put out the fire on October 28. It is unclear how the murder suspects first came in contact with their victim. According to affidavits seen by the Star-Telegram this week, Joseph Dodson is an Aryan Brotherhood member. Walden and Joseph Dodson allegedly went to Robert Dodson's home on October 28 with the plan to rob someone who they have not identified. The three men smoked a joint and as Walden and Dodson were about to leave the oil executive's home, they attacked him. The 44-year-old was restrained and strangled to death before his wallet, credit cards and phone were stolen. After wrapping the body in a blanket, the alleged killers put the victim in his own car before driving off to collect gas from Walden's girlfriend. They then drove separately to the gas site where they set the car and body on fire before fleeing. Joseph Dodson, who was on parole, is being held without bail in Tarrant County Jail. Walden, who has also served prison time, was in Johnson County Jail with bail set at $250,000. Paranoid: Robert Dodson, left, had become fearful since 17-year-old Claudia Hidic, right, was killed at his home . There is not believed to be any link . between Dodson's killing and the death of Claudia Hidic, 17, who was . found dead in his backyard after trying to stage her own kidnapping in . an apparent attempt to extort money from Dodson. According to friends and relatives of . the oil industry executive, the father-of-three was fearful that . someone was after him not long before he was murdered. Dodson first started acting 'paranoid' after he was arrested on October 4 on suspicion of drug possession. He was later indicted on the charge and spent a short time in jail. Following his release, Dodson left the Fort Worth area for a couple of weeks but then returned. The 44-year-old, who served as vice . president of management for the Dallas-based Buckley Oil Company, was . the one who found the body of Miss Hidic at behind his house on June 28. Investigation: Police search for answers in Fort Worth, Texas where Hidic and Dodson lived . According . to authorities, the teenage girl had hired two friends to rob the home . of the oil executive who was friends with her sister, and she was killed . when a gun battle erupted. Shortly after the tragic incident, Dodson moved away from the area. His death came on the day that Hidic would have turned 18. According to the indictment of Hidic’s two alleged accomplices, Terrance Crumley and Curtis Fortenberry, the plan was to pretend that the 17-year-old was a hostage and they were looking for a man named 'Ghost' who owed them $900. The three knocked on the door of the home and were invited inside, police claim. Dodson . was not home at the time, but six other people were. One of the men . inside the home got a pistol from the bathroom and shots were fired. Fortenberry allegedly told police that he may have accidentally killed Miss Hidic, but his attorney refuted those claims. Fatal shooting: Miss Hidic had been given $100 loan by Mr Dodson but later returned to demand more money, which he refused to give her . Claudia Hidic (pictured), a German national from Bosnia, lived with her sister and was at high school . Crumley's attorney, Warren St. John, also said his client was not involved in the shooting. Hidic, a German national from Bosnia, lived in the Fort Worth area with her sister. She studied at Trinity High School in Euless and worked at the Los Jimadores Tex-Mex Tequila Factory in Bedford. She dropped out of Euless after leaving a foster family and moved in with one of her sisters. She had reportedly told people, including Dodson, that she needed money. Just a few days before her death, Dodson had given Hidic a $100 loan. A few days later, she returned to his home and asked for $600 more, but he refused. That's when investigators believe she devised her plan to rob him.","Robert Dodson, 44, found murdered in Fort Worth, Texas on October 28 .

George Roberts with his son Chris who took him to the parade and the parking fine he received while at a Remembrance Day service . A 90-year-old war hero, who risked life and limb for his country during World War Two, was slapped with a £70 parking fine as he attended a Remembrance Day service - because his blue badge was upside down. Disabled George Roberts, who served as a gunner and a driver transporting artillery across Africa, has hit out at jobsworth traffic wardens who gave him the ticket while he paid his respects to fallen comrades in Shrewsbury, Shropshire. The wheelchair-bound veteran was driven to the service at St Chad's Church by his son Michael, 43, who parked in a nearby disabled bay. But when Mr Roberts, who has also survived a stroke and four heart bypass operations, and Michael returned to the car after the emotional service, they were shocked to find a parking ticket on the windscreen. Attempts to reason with a traffic warden fell on deaf ears as the pair were told they would have to contact the local council. The warden even echoed the chilling excuse of some of Hitler's men when he claimed he had issued the ticket because he was 'following orders'. Mr Roberts served in the Royal Artillery Regiment in World War Two and attends the Remembrance Day procession and service every year. Earlier this year he was forced to stop driving but still qualifies for a blue disabled badge because son Michael is his dedicated carer and driver. George, who has four grown-up children, 13 grandchildren and 18 great-grandchildren, said: 'I was struggling to get out of my car and I must have disturbed my blue badge. 'Many millions of men never came back from the war, and I went through it all without a bullet - only to get shot by this.

After the war George married his wartime sweetheart Edith who worked in canteens during the war in Shrewsbury. She died in 2001 aged 81. His grand-daughter Kerrieanne McMullen, 29, hit out at the traffic wardens - branding them 'disgraceful.' She fumed: 'The blue badge was displayed but the wrong way around so you couldn’t see the expiry date. 'To get a ticket on Armistice Day was disgraceful.'

In the small lock-up garage where he helped his father run a fabrics business, Bob Galbraith never dreamed of where hard work and ambition might take him. But there is hardly a bigger showcase for a curtains-maker than the Oval Office, where a fine example of the company's products hang behind the president's desk. Scottish weaver Mr Galbraith, 46, began life helping his dad run the small business Calzeat & Co in Biggar, South Lanarkshire. Grand: President Barack Obama in the Oval Office with the curtains made by Bob Galbraith at his Scottish factory in Biggar, South Lanarkshire . From modest beginnings in a garage, the company grew and hit the summit of its achievements when a call came through from Barack Obama’s interior designer. The required wool fabric was made in just three weeks and has been hung in a number of rooms in the White House, including the famous Oval Office. And in a further stroke of luck, Mr Obama's election means his curtains will hang on the walls of power for another four years. The father-of-three said: 'My dad started with nothing, making ties in a lock-up garage and now we have curtains hanging in the White House. 'They were designed and developed specifically for them at the request of Michelle Obama which is really flattering, we are so proud. Expert snipper: Bob Galbraith, 46, from Biggar who designed the curtain patterns for the Oval Office . 'We have always prided ourselves on quality and design and hopefully that is reflected in our products. I’m very pleased the Obamas seemed to like our work. 'I have a little piece left, and you never know, I may make some cushions for myself from it one day.' Calzeat & Co was founded in 1973 by Mr Galbraith's father Robin, 74, in a lock-up garage in Biggar, South Lanarkshire. He built the business up and now runs shops in Biggar, Peebles, in the Borders, Stockbridge, in Edinburgh, and is planning to open a fourth in December in the capital’s Morningside area. The company also counts celebrities Sean . Connery, Harrison Ford, Steven Spielberg, Dustin Hoffman, George . Clooney, Mike Myers and Gerard Butler among its customers. These accounts came via US interior design Michael Smith, who orders Mr Galbraith's fabrics for homes belonging to his famous clients. The company, run with the help of Mr Galbraith's brothers David, 50, Kevin, 48, and Graeme, 35, employs 52 full- and part-time staff and has an annual turnover of £4million. It also produces clothing, and created a series of contributions for last year’s Dressed to Kilt fashion show in New York. Mr Galbraith said:  'I have met Sean Connery five or six times and I know Mike Myers really well. 'Mike used me to test his Scottish accent when making the Shrek films and when he got married he asked to make him a kilt. 'I feel really lucky that I get to travel around the world and meet all these brilliant people.' The family’s crowning moment came in September 2010 when they received a call from Mr Smith, who became a fan nearly 10 years ago when he unwittingly began to use their fabric for various projects. Impressive: Mr Galbraith's curtains provide a colourful backdrop to the Oval Office . Mr Smith had been commissioned by First Lady Michelle Obama to furnish the inside of the White House, which included replacing the brown curtains hung by former President George W Bush, and wanted to use the family’s fabric. Mr Galbraith and company designer Fiona Knight set to work and three weeks later a sample was sent to the White House for personal approval. After being given the green light, 120 yards of the fabric was dispatched to a curtain-maker in New York for cutting in January last year . The finished design has hung in the White House ever since. Mr Galbraith said: 'I suggested we make them out of pure wool and give it a two tone effect which, from a distance, would look like one block colour. 'I think the design works really well. They hang beautifully and really look the part. 'We made 135 yards but only shipped 120, I have kept the remaining 15 for myself. 'This is a family business, it always has been, and I really hope I can pass that legacy onto my children.'

Secret sex tapes have been handed over to a judge that allegedly contain recordings of a restaurant tycoon demanding sex from his housekeeper. CEO of Waffle House restaurant chain Joe Rogers Jr has admitted to having an affair with his housekeeper but denies any wrongdoing against the woman. A judge took custody of several DVDS on Wednesday in the Georgia courtroom at the request . of Rogers' lawyers, who say the woman has been trying to blackmail . him. Scroll down for video . Mistakes: Waffle House CEO Joe Rogers Jr (left) told reporter at the Georgia courthouse on Wednesday that he had been a dumb*** - to which his wife (right) agreed . The lawsuit stems from accusations made by Rogers' former employee, who cannot be identified, who says she was forced into sex. Attorneys were sorting out whether any copies of the recordings had been made on computer servers. The former employee filed a police report saying Rogers demanded she perform sexual acts to keep her job. Rogers said they had a consensual sexual relationship and that the woman is attempting extortion. He told WSBTV outside court on Wednesday that he had done 'stupid things' as his wife stood by him. Rogers said: 'I was a dumb***' to which his wife added: 'I second . that...'' The 43-year-old woman told Atlanta . police last month that Rogers demanded she perform sexual acts in . exchange for keeping her job and that he also tried to force her to have . sex with him despite her repeated protests. Accusations: Rogers' housekeeper, who cannot be identified, worked for the businessman for almost a decade before handing in her notice in June . She said that he touched . her breasts, tried to remove her clothes, made lewd comments, appeared . naked before her and insisted she perform sex acts on him at least once . or twice a month. She said this occurred for nearly a decade, from 2003 through June of this year until she handed in her resignation. Rogers identified the woman as his former housekeeper, and said she is not telling the truth. In . a statement released on Tuesday, the restaurant tycoon said: 'I am a . victim of my own stupidity, but I am not going to be a victim of a crime . - extortion. 'Over an . almost eight-year period when I was separated, single and re-married, I . had a series of infrequent, consensual sexual encounters with my . housekeeper. He said the woman worked for 15 hours . a week from 2003 until she was let go in 2008. He said she later was . rehired as his house manager and quit her job in June. 'Shortly . thereafter, on July 16, 2012, I received a letter from her attorney . containing false allegations and strong threats,' Rogers said. 'According to her attorneys, she now wants millions of dollars from me.' Rogers said he shared the letter from . the woman's attorney with his wife and they hired lawyers to look into . the situation. Rogers and the woman sued each other, but documents in . those cases were sealed. Rogers' attorney, Robert Ingram, said a Cobb County judge lifted a gag order in . Rogers' lawsuit Tuesday 'so Joe could get his version of the story . out'. Ingram said the woman made intimate videotapes involving Rogers. Claims: The 43-year-old housekeeper told Atlanta police last month that the Waffle House CEO demanded she perform sexual acts in exchange for keeping her job . 'They were tapes that [she] recorded, which is a crime in the state of Georgia to record somebody when that person had an expectation of privacy and doesn't consent to the recording,' Ingram said. David Cohen, the woman's attorney, said: 'We understand he's obviously trying to spin his wrongful actions in some positive light. 'We believe attempting to attack the victim will only make matters worse and that the parties just need to let a jury decide the issues. Our position and facts as they have evolved thus far are stated in our verified counterclaim filed in the courthouse, which is part of the record unsealed by the court today.' In the police report, the woman identified herself as a single mother. She said she stayed in the job and submitted to Rogers because she couldn't find other employment with comparable pay. She said she gave Rogers a letter of resignation in June after her son secured a full college scholarship.

The son of a Connecticut police chief has been indicted by a federal grand jury after he was seen on video throwing a handcuffed inmate into a jail cell and cracking his head on a metal bench, which knocked him unconscious. The May 2010 battery is just one of three police brutality complaints against Meriden police Officer Evan Cossett, who allegedly avoided discipline because his father Jeffrey Cossett leads the department. Surveillance video inside the cell shows Evan Cossett shoving Pedro Temich backwards as his hands are cuffed behind his back. When he falls, Temich hits his head and is clearly out cold. Scroll down for video . 'Brutality': Officer Evan Cossette is seen with Pedro Temich after the handcuffed prisoner was knocked unconscious when he hit his head . Injured: Temich bashed his head against a bench in the cell and required several stitches after he was found unconscious by an emergency dispatcher. Cossett is accused of lying in his police report . Cossett doesn't go for medical help, and instead re-enters the cell several times to move the unconscious prisoner around, first propping him up and then removing his handcuffs. A pool of blood is visible on the floor of the cell. Authorities say Cossett then lied about the incident in his police report, claiming that Temich had resisted him and tried to fight, according to the Meriden Record Journal. An internal affairs supervisor initially recommended that Cossetted be disciplined with a temporary suspension. However, Deputy Chief Timothy Topulos intervened in the case and instead issued a letter of reprimand and ordered him to go to training -- a much less severe punishment. Record of complaints: In January Cossett and another officer were recorded beating a man outside a hospital . The alleged assault in 2010 wasn't Cossett's last. In January, he and another Meriden police officer beat a 30-year-old man who was drunk and walking away from a hospital where he had just been committed. Surveillance video captured Cossett punching Joey Bryans several times as he was held on the ground. The video also shows Cossett shocking Mr Bryans several times with a taser while he is restrained, as well. Mr Bryans, Mr Temich and a third man, Robert Methvin, are all suing the Meriden Police Department, alleging that they were abused at Cossett's hands. The brutality case came to the attention of city authorities when two of Cossett's fellow officers complained to city officials that he had received special treatment because his father is the chief. An independent investigation launched by the city found insufficient evidence that the police department conspired to keep Cossett out of trouble. However, the Connecticut State Police and the FBI continued to investigate the brutality allegations. Cossett faces up to 30 years in federal prison and a $500,000 fine, if convicted.","Officer Evan Cossett is accused of shoving the handcuffed prisoner, knocking him unconscious, and then lying about the incident .

Ahead of tonight's premiere of the second season of the Real Housewives of Beverly Hills, questions have finally been answered about whether Russell Armstrong will feature in the show, following his suicide three weeks ago. The show's executive producer Douglas Ross confirmed on this morning's edition of The Today Show that the late, estranged husband of star Taylor Armstrong would not be appearing in the first few episodes. His comments came as three cast members Adrienne Maloof, Kyle Richards and Lisa Vanderpump, spoke out for the first time since Russell's death. Re-edit: Real Housewives of Beverly Hills Executive Producer Douglas Ross discussed Russell Armstrong's suicide with sstars Lisa Vanderpump, Kyle Richards and Adrienne Maloof on The Today Show this morning . 'In . the first few episodes that we've finished editing, Russell is not . included in these episodes,' Ross said during the appearance. 'But it is important to know . that Taylor's story is told throughout the season.' Media reports had suggested that the . initial cut of the series premiere featured some elements of the . couple's deteriorating relationship. Ross confirmed Bravo had made 'some adjustments' in order to be 'respectful and responsible.' Meanwhile, Adrienne, Lisa and Kyle revealed they had recently spoken to Taylor. Reaction: The reality show stars will also appear in an interview ahead of tonight's premiere episode of the show's second season . Sad reality: The demise of Taylor and Russell Armstrong's marriage is likely to be detailed in the second season of the hit show . 'She was very beside herself,' said Adrienne.  'I think her concern is her little girl now. It's heart breaking.' 'We spent a couple of evenings with her this week,' said Lisa. 'She's trying to . digest everything. 'We've tried to be as supportive as possible but her . priority is her little girl. It's been very very sad. Very difficult,' she added, referring to Taylor and Russell's five-year-old daughter Kennedy. And Kyle said news of Russell's death was a 'complete shock.' She said: 'I always saw him as being reserved and . quiet. I knew that they had their issues. But no-one could have . anticipated something like that.' But all three housewives were adamant when asked by Today show host Savannah Guthrie if appearing on the reality show had 'racked up the pressure' on Russell. 'We lead and they follow,' said Lisa. 'We create and they document. I've never felt any responsibility to bring drama. 'If you follow the lives of six people over a year, and we've all had some major issues in the last year and a half, they just tell the accurate story.' 'It's basically documenting our lives. It's reality TV and it's very real,' added Adrienne, . They also admitted there was some thought about whether the season would go ahead. 'I think we all had to reflect at some point,' admitted Adrienne. Their responses came just days after Russell's mother John Ann . Hotchkiss released a statement expressing her dissatisfaction that the season would not be delayed following her son's death by hanging at a friend's house in L.A. on August 15. Difficult: Lisa Vanderpump revealed she had spent a few evenings with cast mate Taylor Armstrong, who had been 'trying to digest' the events of the past few weeks . Speaking out: Kyle came to the defence of the reality show, saying that Russell Armstrong had signed up for season two, while Adrienne said they had to 'reflect' following the tragedy . 'When I was informed of this, I thought, ""I hope Bravo will take the . high road and keep it tasteful. Let's not murder my son twice."" She . said: ""I began to notice things starting to fray when the television . thing came into being, and I was very concerned. The programme itself . really brought him down.' However Kyle reiterated that Russell had 'signed up for season one and came back for season two.' She . added: 'When we started the show, they cast six women and they didn't . really know anything about our story. Not appearing: Russell Armstrong, seen here in a first season episode of Real Housewives of Beverly Hills, will not be seen in the first few episodes of the new season . 'They didn't know in season one . that Kelsey was going to leave Camille or the issues between my sister . (Kim) and me. They certainly didn't know the troubles that he had.' 'This show is about . six strong, aggressive, successful beautiful women and their stories,' added Ross. 'And although Taylor and Russell's story is a part of it, it's not the . whole show. 'But we did want to address it appropriately and that's why . tonight's episode gets the entire cast together to sit down and . reflect and talk about their feelings of sadness and grief and try to . put the season we shot six months ago in perspective.'

TV regulator Ofcom has received 415 complaints about last week's incident and has launched an investigation into it. Scroll down for video .

He said: 'I think the way This Morning interviewed the Prime Minister last Thursday or that portion of the interview was wrong, was misguided. 'I'm not happy that this happened. We have editorial processes and checks in place and, to be honest with you, they weren't followed so I'm not happy about that but I think the way we have tackled this and responded to this has been quick and decisive.' Mr Fincham said the channel would 'co-operate fully' with the Ofcom investigation. He said he was unable to discuss the . disciplinary action taken against those involved in the production but . the matter had been taken 'extremely seriously'. He . added: 'I've spoken to Phillip Schofield myself. He realises his . mistake. He apologised for it extremely fully and extremely quickly and I . discussed that with him and I think he's under no illusions that this . was a lapse in ITV journalism; this is something we shouldn't have . done.' The Prime Minister takes the card and responds . with firm words warning of a 'witch hunt' that meant prominent people . were being wrongly accused of child abuse simply because they were gay . The Prime Minister was visibly taken aback by the stunt and some viewers said names were clearly visible on the piece of paper handed to the Prime Minister . Warning: Andrew Reid, Lord McAlpine's solicitor, has said they know the identity of everyone who has defamed him online . Former BBC One controller Mr Fincham, who resigned from the corporation in 2007 after misleading footage appearing to show the Queen storming out of a photoshoot was used in a trailer, added that Schofield 'stays on air'. His interview follows a demand by Mr Whittingdale, who is chairman of the Commons Culture, Media and Sport Committee, that ITV reveals who was involved in the decision to show Mr Cameron the list during the programme. Appearance: Phillip Schofield was on the show today but looked subdued throughout . In a letter to Mr Fincham, he said: 'As you are aware, during the interview Mr Schofield presented the Prime Minister with a list of names of individuals alleged to have been involved in paedophilia which it had taken him 'about three minutes' to obtain from the internet. 'I understand that Mr Schofield has apologised for the fact that some of the names might have been visible and that Ofcom is also considering a complaint about this matter. 'However, there has been widespread concern expressed about the decision itself to confront the Prime Minister with such a list. 'I would therefore be grateful if you could say whether or not it is the view of ITV that this represented responsible journalism in the public interest. 'I would also like to know at what level the decision was taken, what legal advice was sought, and what subsequent consideration has been given to the appropriateness of this broadcast.' Schofield has apologised personally after the list of names - understood to be Conservative Party figures - was briefly exposed on screen. An ITV spokesman said: 'Last Thursday we began an investigation into the circumstances surrounding the mistake on that day's This Morning programme, for which both Phillip Schofield and ITV apologised. 'This investigation has now concluded and the appropriate disciplinary action has been taken. 'We sincerely apologise because the way in which the issue was raised was clearly wrong and should have been handled differently. We have taken steps to make sure our editorial processes are always properly followed, which was not the case in this instance, and to ensure such an error will not be made again.' What's your reaction to Ofcom saying they'll investigate ITV? It's very embarrassing isn't it? PF: 'Well let me say straight away that I think the way This Morning interviewed Prime Minister last Thursday or that portion of the interview was wrong, was misguided. On that day Phillip Schofield issued a statement apologising. We did the same. We launched an investigation straight away. That concluded today, less than a week from the interview. We've issued a fuller statement and we've taken disciplinary action.' But you say disciplinary action but Phillip Schofield was still on air today. What sort of disciplinary action? PF: 'I can't discuss in detail what disciplinary action we've taken against those involved in the production. I've spoken to Phillip Schofield myself. He realises his mistake. He apologised for it extremely fully and extremely quickly and I discussed that with him and I think he's under no illusions that this was a lapse in ITV journalism; this is something we shouldn't have done.' This is terribly embarrassing for ITV. How could this have happened? MPs want to know… . PF: 'In live television all sorts of things could happen, that doesn't mean they should happen and when something goes wrong along these lines we take it very seriously. We move very fast. I'm confident this sort of thing won't happen again. In the meantime that's what we've been looking into in more detail.' No tougher punishments, no suspensions things like that? PF: 'I can't discuss the details of the disciplinary action but I can assure you that we think it's appropriate and we have taken this extremely seriously.' And you've had a legal letter from Lord McAlpine? PF: 'We have had a letter from Lord McAlpine today and we will respond to that very quickly and I've also had a letter from John Whittingdale and I will respond to that quickly as well. As you say, OFCOM have launched an investigation and of course  we will co-operate fully in that investigation.' And you're happy that all the steps that should have been taken for that programme were taken? Where was the editor? Where were the production staff?

Tragic: Ray Dibbs 36, died after a single punch sent him reeling to the floor and he hit his head on the pavement . A father of two was fatally injured when a single punch knocked him to the floor and he smashed his head on a kerb after he tried to defend a pensioner in his local pub. Raymond Dibbs, 36, had popped . in for a Saturday afternoon pint in his local public house when he went . to the aid of an elderly drinker who he heard being mocked as 'a bloody . retard' by a younger man. An inquest heard it led to a fight outside, during . which Mr Dibbs was punched once in the face, fell and hit his . head on the kerb. The businessman, whose father Tory Cllr Roland Dibbs is deputy leader the deputy leader of Rushmoor Borough Council, was airlifted to hospital but died 24 hours later. The tragic death shocked regulars at the Old Courthouse public house in Farnborough, Hampshire. Police arrested 37-year-old Luke Boswell but he was later released without charge. Mr Dibbs was operations manager at global education firm WRS International and the only son of Cllr Roland Dibbs, the deputy leader of Rushmoor Borough Council. Alton Coroner's Court heard he was angered when he heard Mr Boswell call pensioner John Hayter a 'retard' while he was drinking with him in the bar. Mr Dibbs confronted 6ft 1ins tall Mr Boswell but the pair were separated by the barman and Mr Boswell went outside for a cigarette. Mr Dibbs was then heard to say “I’m not being spoken to like that” before he rushed past punters, out of a side door and began wildly swinging at Mr Boswell outside of the pub, the inquest heard. The animated reaction was said to be out of character for Mr Dibbs who was described as intellectual and placid. Barman Fred Lamont told the inquest jury: 'You could tell Ray wasn’t the fighting type. He was swinging both arms in an uncontrollable manner. He was ""wind milling"". Local pub: Mr Dibbs had popped into The Old Court House pub in Farnborough, Hampshire, when he got into an argument with another patron Luke Boswell . Emergency: The father-of-two, pictured with family members, was airlifted to hospital after hitting his head but died 24 hours later . 'As Ray got closer, Luke put up his left foot and right hand to block him and Ray has obviously connected with his foot as it’s raised and taken a huge stumble backwards - he was right on the edge of the kerb. 'As he was stumbling backwards, Luke swung at him. The first punch came across his shoulder but from where I was standing I couldn’t see if that connected. 'Ray tripped off the kerb and where he was trying to correct himself, he span around and landed on the side of his head.' A post-mortem established the businessman died from a head injury. He had a fractured skull and signs of haemorrhaging on the brain. Toxicology tests found he had around twice the legal alcohol limit for driving in his system, but not enough to be 'rolling drunk' at the time of the fight. Mr Boswell, who had been banned from pubs in the area in the past, was seen by several witnesses to punch Mr Dibbs in the side of the head during the altercation. Accidental death: A jury at Alton Coroner's Court ruled that Mr Dibbs died of accidental death . One drinker, Sean Hunter, said: 'Ray was a lovely fellow but he was not a fighter. He swung a few punches and Luke blocked them. Luke threw one. It was not a decent punch, but Ray went down. It connected to his face, probably the cheekbone area.' It emerged at the inquest that frail Mr Hayter would often pick fights with drinkers at the Old Courthouse after he’d had a few drinks - especially Luke Boswell - and is known to shadow box at the bar. But Mr Dibbs was not a regular and wouldn’t have realised this when he went to the older man’s defence on April 14. Giving evidence, Mr Boswell said: 'John Hayter is always causing trouble. He is who he is. He does it all the time, and if it’s not to me it’s to someone else. He does it every time you go in the pub, it does get to you, it’s annoying. 'I was sitting there in the corner with my friends. He (Hayter) kept going on - he’d clearly already had more than his two pints that day. It’s always the same with him. I just told him to shut up to be honest. 'Ray had literally been in the pub three or four minutes when I said to John - and I feel sorry for saying it now - ""shut up you bloody retard"". 'Ray turned around and said ""who are you calling a retard?"" and I said ""I ain’t talking to you, I’m talking to him"". 'Then Ray said ""you’re the bloody retard"" and I said ""I’m sick and tired of this. I’ve had him [Hayter] starting now I don’t need you starting"" and then I walked out of the pub.' Mr Boswell told how he smoked a cigarette and then he saw Mr Dibbs coming towards him outside of the pub. He said he reacted to defend himself, adding: 'One blow and that was it. I stood there just in shock. I looked at him covered in blood and I panicked a bit. Someone came out of the pub and said ""Luke, the best thing for you to do is go"" and that’s what I did. 'It should never have happened, never in my eyes. I thought if I go outside and have a cigarette and it would all have calmed down. He’s come towards me swinging his arms, I stuck my foot out to stop him, missed him and after that it was literally seconds before he was on the floor.' Mr Boswell added: 'I would like to know whether it’s my fault that he came off the kerb or if he just slipped. I don’t know and I’m never going to know...I think about it all the time.' After questioning Mr Boswell, police released him as there was no evidence to suggest that it was a murder case or that the suspect intended to cause serious harm. Mr Dibbs lived in affluent West Heath Road, Farnborough, Hampshire, with his partner Rachel, their two children Harley, aged three years, and Lily, aged 10 years; and Rachel’s eldest son from a previous relationship, Zack, aged 17 years. Rachel and Mr Dibbs’s father were in court for the inquest. A jury of four men and four women returned a verdict of accidental death. Paying tribute to his son, a tearful Cllr Dibbs said: 'He was a good son and a very good father. He’s hugely missed by his whole family. 'I don’t think there can ever be closure. Rachel has got two children and I’ve got two grandchildren who will grow up without a father who, of course, they miss terribly. 'We cannot understand how this has happened. Ray was not a violent person or likely to get into any fights. 'He was a very successful businessman who worked hard all his life and has never been out of work. He was very popular and well liked.'","Father-of-two Raymond Dibbs, 36, got into an argument with another patron who called a pensioner 'a retard' at his local pub .

Researchers today revealed the most in depth study of the millipede lllacme plenipes, which was thought to be extinct, but  was re-discovered several years ago in California. The females have up to an astounding 750 legs, outclassing the males who only have a maximum leg count of 562, the researchers found. Scroll down for video . Females of the millipede lllacme plenipes can have up to 750 legs, researchers have found. It is found in California near to Silicon Valley . Millipedes have the most legs of any animal group. From their ancestors . with just one pair of legs per body segment, millipedes evolved two . pairs (four total) through a process known as segmental fusion more . than 400 million years ago. Four legs provide more thrust on a per . segment basis, which benefits millipedes to help them burrow . underground to escape predators or get to food. Those . individuals with a coalescence of segments and hence a better burrowing . ability, were able to persist in this early primordial ecosystem. The animal is still believed to be incredibly rare, extreme rarity, limited to a handful of spots just south of San Francisco on the edge of Silicon Valley. 'This relict species is the only representative of its family in the . Western Hemisphere. 'Its closest presumed relative, Nematozonium filum, . lives in South Africa and this early relationship was established more . than 200 million years ago when the continents coalesced in the landmass . Pangaea', said the lead author Dr Paul Marek, from the University of . Arizona. Not only is this species the leggiest animal known on the planet, the team say, it . also has surprising anatomical features: body hairs that produce silk, a . jagged and scaly translucent exoskeleton, and comparatively massive . (given its diminutive size) antennae that are used to feel its way . through the dark because it lacks eyes. Its mouth, unlike other . millipedes that chew with developed grinding mouthparts, is rudimentary . and fused into structures that are probably used for piercing and . sucking plant or fungal tissues. In Illacme plenipes (literally meaning 'in highest fulfillment of . feet'), the females have up to an astounding 750 legs, outclassing the . males who only have a maximum leg count of 562. The proliferation of . legs may be an adaptation for its lifestyle spent burrowing underground . or (based on the presence of features like legs with bifurcate claws and . other traits known to be associated with rock-climbing in millipedes) enable it to cling tightly to the sandstone boulders found exclusively . associated with the species in its habitat . Using scanning electron microscopes the researchers were able to look at the creatures in unprecedented detail . The most noticeable thing about millipedes are their number of legs, . which lined up along their bodysides step in synchronous 'metachronal . waves'. This rare and ancient-looking creature's home is California, on the . outskirts of Silicon Valley. The species is exceedingly scarce and . limited to just a single tiny area near San Juan Bautista, just east of . the San Andreas Fault. Based on the known environmental conditions where . it lives, the species' probable distribution elsewhere in California . was inferred. The researchers found dozens of the insects in the wild . Yet still restricted to a small geographical range, the . analysis indicated other areas of suitability limited to the terrestrial . areas on the edge of Monterey Bay eastward to San Juan Bautista and . throughout the Salinas Valley. What's unique about this area, and seems . to be correlated with the model's area of highest suitability, is the . thick layer of fog that accumulates in the area--like soup in a deep . bowl. The fog and the species' unique set of features in its habitat . (oak forests, sandstone boulders, and fine sandy soil) make this area a . special place and certainly deserving of attention as the home of this . rare and superlative beast, the researchers believe. The millipedes have been found in the areas marked in blue, and researchers believe they may exist in other coloured areas .","Once thought to be extinct, astonishing animal has been found at a handful of sites near Silicon Valley .

"By . Mail Today Bureau . PUBLISHED: . 15:31 EST, 14 November 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 15:31 EST, 14 November 2012 . Unimpressed: Telecom Minister Kapil Sibal . This was a bridge too far for a cash-strapped Indian government. In an apparent bid to bridge the fiscal deficit, it was banking on raising over Rs 40,000 crore from the 2G spectrum auction. But the plan failed abysmally as telecom companies - bristling with anger over an exorbitantly high reserve price of Rs 13,850 crore for all 22 circles set at the auction - decided to stay away. What the government got was a mere Rs 9,407 crore. Worse, the lucrative Delhi and Mumbai circles went begging and found no takers. Karnataka and Rajasthan had no bidders either. In fact, none bid for an all-India licence. The end result was that the ambitious plans to curtail the ballooning budget deficit had come a cropper and the government had only itself to blame. The telecom industry drew a clear link between the reserve price and the poor response. ""First and foremost among the many causes, is the recognition that an artificially-high reserve price that bore no congruence to market realities was the key reason for the failure,"" said Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI)'s director general Rajan Mathews. Telecom minister Kapil Sibal appeared to have read the reason for the 2G auction fizzle. He said the government may put the circles on auction again and possibly rework the auction reserve prices. ""We would like to auction unsold spectrum by March next year. The government will take a call on lowering auction the price of Delhi and Mumbai,"" Sibal said on Wednesday. A top official said the department of telecommunications (DoT) would ask Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) to look into the reserve price for the pan-India 2G licence. For the record, this is almost seven times more than what telcos paid in the 2008 when then telecom minister A. Raja gave them start-up spectrum of 4.4 MHz at Rs 1,651 crore. The government was looking crestfallen and defeated and industry was determined to blame it for the poor show. ""The results of the auction clearly indicate that the reserve price was completely off the mark, with none of the interested operators not pitching in for the circles that they had committed to participate in,"" said Prashant Singhal, a partner in Ernst & Young Global. The auction was held after the Supreme Court in February this year cancelled 122 licences held by eight telecom operators. It ended after 15 rounds on the second day of bidding. Bharti Airtel, Vodafone, Idea Cellular, Norway's Telenor and Videocon bid for GSM airwaves, but there were no bidders for the CDMA spectrum after Tata Teleservices and Videocon pulled out of the race. New players and telecom companies affected by the Supreme Court verdict had to win at least four blocks to start or continue their operations. While telcos in India had an eye on their balance sheet as they bid at the auction, the government made little effort in doing roadshows abroad to lure foreign players. Telcos highlighted several deterrents that led to the poor bids. COAI's Rajan Mathews said the majority of bidders were operators who had lost their licences and were compelled to participate in the auctions despite the high prices and the limited availability in order to sustain their customers, businesses and to protect their investments. This apart, the limiting of spectrum available for auction, which contrary to the Supreme Court ruling to auction the entire spectrum related to the quashing of the 2G licences, added to the sense of uncertainty among potential bidders. The artificial scarcity created by holding back spectrum combined with the high reserve price dampened any enthusiasm for aggressive bidding by the operators. ""The auctions have concluded on the exact note as predicted,"" said Mathews. The only circle that did well in the bids was Bihar, where the provisional winning price increased by Rs 1.7 crore over the reserve price. Apart from Bihar, demand was largely concentrated in Uttar Pradesh (East), Uttar Pradesh (West) and Gujarat. Meanwhile, Vodafone India, which won airwaves in six zones, said it had always maintained that auctions were the best and the only transparent method for allocation of spectrum. ""Our decision to participate in the 2G auction was to secure additional spectrum in many circles where we have not received any new 2G spectrum since 2008,"" the company said in a statement. However, it said that the entire spectrum that is currently unused should be put on auction at the same time with a much lower reserve price. ""The government should follow TRAI's advice to abandon staggered spectrum usage fees which are higher for operators who require more spectrum. This does not make sense if spectrum is bought in an auction and is paid for already. Spectrum usage fees should be flat and only represent the charge for administering the spectrum. TRAI has advised to put this at 1% of revenues,"" the Videocon statement said. By Sandeep Bamzai . On January 10, 2008, A. Raja with great alacrity and aplomb subverted the . system to allocate out of turn spectrum to a handful of beneficiaries . at 2001 prices without indexing for inflation. He did this despite . repeated advice given by different sections in the government to use a . market determined auction process. On February 2, 2012, the Supreme . Court struck down the award of these licences in a landmark decision . clearly establishing malafide. The average revenue per user in 2008 for . telcos was hovering around Rs 300. Cut to November, 2012 when ARPUS have . dropped to sub Rs 100 (Rs 97). By setting an unimaginably high reserve price . of Rs 14,000 crore for all India spectrum (22 circles), a greedy . government grossly miscalculated and ended up with egg on its face. This . was the biggest deterrent for local telcos already staring at a . mountain of debt on their balance sheets. Share prices of top telcos . have been beaten down mercilessly due to this very factor. Just to give . you a flavour of what we are talking about - Reliance Communications' total debt on March 31, 2012 was Rs 27,871 crore, Bharti Airtel as on end . March was Rs 14,129 crore while Idea Cellular was Rs 10,138 crore. Once the . Supreme Court said transparent market forces should determine the . auction reserve price, the cash-strapped government should have paid . heed to market realities. Industry repeatedly told the DoT brass that . the reserve price could not be linked to 3G auction prices. A . beleaguered government was keen on bridging the ballooning fiscal . deficit and the 2G spectrum auction was manna from the heavens. But the best . laid plans of mice and men often go awry. On the eve of the auction . both the biggies from the CDMA space - Tatas and Reliance - pulled out. In . fact, Reliance did not even bid. Which left the foreign telecoms to . plug and play. The government of India made no ostensible move to engage . with foreign telecoms, there were no road shows, no hiking of 74 per . cent cap in the sector as bait resulting in a desultory and . disappointing auction. Finally, the government has realised a paltry Rs 9,407 crore against an estimated Rs 40,000 crore. If I remember right, in . 2008 the government managed to bring in a tad over Rs 9,000 crore. A . scandal-tainted auction in 2008 has been reprised in 2012 viz the amount . raised. What the government required was fresh foreign capital. It . could have been more aggressive with its pitch with foreign telecoms not . present in India - but all to no avail. It is Telenor which came forward . to bid and win six most populous circles, deciding to stay the course in . India where they had successfully managed to build a sliver of a . business. Once again validating that those who bid, bid selectively and . strategically looking to optimise with circles that according to the . players had the highest potential for continued growth and . profitability. That nobody bid for all the circles was most telling. What was crucial for this SC-mandated exercise was a little foresight, . some planning and vital insight into how telecoms function globally. What it ended up doing was getting its maths all wrong and antagonising . an already fractured industry. A two-day auction is what it managed . ultimately, against a 35-day gruelling 3G auction process. Rs 9,000 crore . ball park vs Rs 67,000 crore in 2010 is probably the rub of the green, but . an abject slap on the face of a government which got ahead of the . curve.","Government had hoped to raise Rs 40,000 but netted just Rs 9,407 crore .

Hope Solo married her footballer fiancé on Tuesday, hours after he appeared in court accused of striking her in a domestic dispute during a late-night party at their home, it has been claimed. The soccer star's wedding to Jerramy Stevens was believed to have taken place after Solo's soccer teammate Jillian Loyden, who arrived in the couple's hometown of Seattle on November 11, made an announcement on Twitter. Loyden, who won gold alongside Solo at this summer's Olympic Games, tweeted: 'Happy to witness such an amazing celebration of real love.' Scroll down for video . Moving fast: Hope Solo has reportedly married her fiancé Jerramy Stevens after dating for two months . Former Seattle Seahawks player Jerramy Stevens, (rear), listens during a bail hearing Municipal Court in Kirkland, Washington on Tuesday, Nov. 13, 2012. He was released without conditions by the judge who didn't find probable cause to hold him . The pair had applied for a marriage license last Thursday and have been together for two months. Former Seahawks tight end Jerramy . Stevens, 33, was arrested at 3.45am on Monday for the fourth-degree . assault of Hope, 31, after an altercation involving a number of people . which left the controversial soccer star nursing a cut elbow. According . to the police report, Stevens was taken into custody after officers . were called by Solo's older brother Marcus, who had used a 'stun gun' to . fight off a group of men who were not invited to a party at the house. After appearing in front of the Kirkland Municipal Court judge today, Stevens, who has a long list of run-ins with the police, was released after no evidence was produced connecting Stevens to any assault during the fracas. Also in court to witness her fiancé . was U.S. women's soccer team goalkeeper Hope Solo, who had allegedly . already been uncooperative with King County Police regarding the . incident and declined to give comment after the legal proceedings. Soccer star Hope Solo leaves a court room with her lawyer Peter Offenbecher, (left), before a bail hearing for former Seattle Seahawks player Jerramy Stevens today . Official announcement: Solo's teammate Jillian Loyden posted this tweet hours after her fiancé appeared in court . A . call to a number listed for Stevens in court documents rang unanswered. A message left at a listed number for Solo was not immediately . returned. The two, who have been in a relationship for two months, were set to get . married on Tuesday and argued over whether to live in Washington or . Florida, according to court documents. Police in the Seattle suburb of Kirkland responded to a disturbance at a . home around 3.45 a.m. Monday involving a physical altercation between . eight people during a party, said Kirkland police Lt. Mike Murray. He . said officers contacted several people in the home who appeared . intoxicated and didn't cooperate with police, but determined based on . information and observations that there was probable cause to arrest . Stevens for investigation of fourth-degree assault. Murray didn't . identify the alleged victim, but court records show it was Solo, who . received a cut to her elbow. Court documents show that Solo's . 36-year-old brother, Marcus, called 911, and that he and Solo told . officers there was a party and blamed the disturbance on two to three . unknown men who were at the party. Marcus Solo told police he used a . stun gun on one of the men, who left the party before police arrived, . according to court records. According to court documents, a police officer found Stevens, 'who . appeared to be hiding,' lying between the bed and the wall in an . upstairs bedroom. Stevens told officers he was sleeping on the floor and . didn't hear the fight. The officer saw signs of a fight, and dried . blood on Stevens' shirt. The officer noted in his affidavit for . probable cause for arrest that he arrested Stevens based on his . admission that he argued with Hope Solo, the injury to her elbow, signs . of a fight in the bedroom where Stevens was found and blood on Stevens' shirt. One 32-year-old woman was taken to the hospital for . treatment of a hip injury, and another man suffered multiple bumps, . scrapes and contusions, Murray said. 'If officers find that an . assault may have taken place, then we have to make an arrest on who we . determine is the primary aggressor,' Murray said. He was mostly a first-round bust with the Seahawks, except for the 2005 season when he started a career-high 12 games and had 45 receptions as the Seahawks won the NFC championship. Hope Solo (centre left) and Jerramy Stevens (centre right) pose for an Instagram picture last month . His run-ins with the law weren't done when he left college. Stevens was arrested on reckless driving charges in 2003 in a Seattle suburb and in 2007 when he was charged with driving under the influence in Scottsdale, Arizona. Stevens' most recent arrest came in 2010, while he was playing for Tampa Bay, when he was arrested the night before a game for possession of marijuana. He was almost immediately released by the team. Controversial soccer star Hope Solo has a history of high profile run-ins with authority and even with her own team-mates. In August, extracts from her latest autobiography book revealed the frustration she felt after the clique of older players within the U.S. women's soccer team suspended her for comments she made after being benched in favor of veteran goalkeeper Briana Scurry in 2007. Hope Solo celebrates after defeating Japan by a score of 2-1 to win the Women's Football gold medal match at Wembley Stadium in August . The outspoken two-time Olympic champion's book, 'Solo: A Memoir of Hope', gives the 31-year-old's version of events after she described the decision to replace her for the United States' 4-0 defeat at the hands of Brazil 'the wrong decision'. Detailing a dramatic and aggressive confrontation with the heroes of the 1999 World Cup winning U.S. team following her comments, Solo, who was 26 at the time reveals she was made to publicly apologize twice before her teammates took the decision to kick her off the team during the tournament in China. Originally in the starting 11 for the 2007 World Cup, Solo was relegated to the bench after a series of poor performances during the United States' run to the semi-final match against the Brazilians. Replaced by Briana Scurry, then 36-years-old, who had acted as Solo's mentor during her time in the soccer set-up, the flamboyant goalkeeper spoke to the media after the defeat to explain why coach Greg Ryan had made 'the wrong decision.' Former Seattle Seahawks tight end Jerramy Stevens speaks with the media in Detroit, Michigan in this file photo . In the hours following her comments, Solo claims that she did not for-see any problems with what she had said. However, upon arrival to their hotel in Shanghai, Solo was summoned to the hotel room of team captain Kristine Lilly, who was waiting for her with other so-called veterans of the 1999 World Cup victory. 'It was our team captain Kristine Lilly. She said the veterans wanted to talk to me and asked if I would come to their room,' explained Solo in her memoir. 'I walked down the hall. By now it was after midnight. I pushed open the door of Lil's room and saw the veterans grimly waiting for me. Kate Markgraf stood by the door. Lil, Shannon Boxx, Christie Pearce Rampone, Abby, and Bri sat on the beds. 'I walked across to the other side of the room and leaned against the wall. 'They had seen the interview. I was told that I had, in their opinion, basically committed treason.'Describing the expletive filled lecture she received from the older players, Solo revealed that experienced defender Kate Markgraf walked out on the meeting saying 'I can't even f***ing look at you.' Solo reveals in her book that she found this to be 'overly dramatic.' 'They told me that you don't throw a teammate under the bus, that I had broken the code, that I had betrayed the team,' said Solo. Fun!

Level playing field: John Lewis managing director Andy Street has called on the Government to look at the way foreign multinational companies pay tax in the UK . High street institution John Lewis said it could be put out of business if foreign multinationals are not forced to pay more tax in the UK. Andy Street, managing director of the retailer, issued a stark warning about the effect on domestic businesses if the Government does not create a level playing field. He said companies in overseas tax havens will 'out-invest and ultimately out-trade' businesses paying full taxes in the UK. Mr Street has now called on the Treasury to look into the 'principle' that underpins where earnings are taxed - suggesting that UK companies are not competing on a level playing field. His comments come two days after bosses from Starbucks, Google and Amazon were subjected to a three-hour grilling by MPs over how they manage to pay little or no corporation tax on their UK operations. All three denied accusations they were engaged in aggressive tax avoidance and were met with derision from members of the Public Accounts Select Committee. Last year, John Lewis Partnership, which is owned by its 76,500 staff, who receive a share of any profits at the end of the company's financial year, reported half year profits fell 18% due to increased investment and it's commitment to be 'never knowingly undersold'. Profits were also affected by 'extremely challenging' conditions, including competition from other high street and online retailers. Mr Street told the Sky News Jeff Randall Live show that the tax issue was wider than any rivalry between John Lewis and companies such as Amazon. He said: 'Our customers expect around a fair and level playing field and I suspect our customers do think both companies should be treated in the same way.' Mr Street said overseas companies will effectively be able to invest more in the long run thanks to low tax bills. He said: 'You have got less money to invest if you're giving 27% of your profits to the Exchequer than, clearly, if you're domiciled in a tax haven and you've got much more. 'So they will out-invest and ultimately out-trade us and that means there will not be the tax base in the UK. So I do think it's an issue that needs to be examined.' Mr Street also argued that the Treasury should look into the 'whole question' of whether earnings from a particular country were taxed in that same country. Earlier this week Amazon public policy director Andrew Cecil received criticism from MPs when he appeared before the MPs' committee. Taxing: Andrew Cecil, Director Public Policy at Amazon, was grilled by MPs this week over basing their EU operation in Luxembourg . Threatened: John Lewis Partnership, which runs more than 40 department stores in the UK, including this store in Oxford Street, said it will be 'out-traded' by foreign multinationals unless a fair tax playing field is created (file picture) Committee chair Margaret Hodge said that he was not a 'serious person' after failing to give key information and vowed to call in another Amazon executive to fill holes in his evidence. She said: 'The idea that you come here and simply don't answer the question and pretend ignorance - it's just not on, it's awful.' She also told the executives before . her: 'We're not accusing you of being illegal, we're accusing you of being . immoral.' Jonathan Isaby, political director of the TaxPayers' Alliance, echoed the call for the Government to investigate the current tax system. He said he 'understood the public anger' over the issue. He added: 'But what we have to remember is that they are operating within rules and legislation, set by a succession of governments of all colours, that have provided loopholes in a tax code which is thousands of pages long, incredibly complex and burdensome. 'What the call from Andy Street for an investigation should mean, is that the Government should not only be looking at multinationals and how they pay tax but how all businesses pay tax in this country.' Amazon told MPs at the beginning of the week that it used Luxembourg as a base for its . European operations because of the favourable tax rate there. Andrew Cecil, the online retailer's public policy . director, said the Luxembourg business's turnover in 2011 was £7.3billion yet it . paid taxes of just £6.4million. It paid no UK tax in 2010 on revenues of . £3.3billion. Google paid only £6million to the Treasury . last year on UK sales of £2.6billion.

"By . Nina Golgowski . PUBLISHED: . 23:55 EST, 14 November 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 02:09 EST, 15 November 2012 . Losers: New York Jets quarterback Tim Tebow is seen on the sidelines of Sunday's game against the Seattle Seahawks where the Jets lost 28-7 and teammates called him 'terrible' The players on the New York Jets have come to a consensus on Tim Tebow: He's no good at football. Tebow became the most famous player in the league last season for improbably leading a mediocre Denver Broncos team into the playoffs. This season, more than a dozen of his teammates in New York spoke out to say he's a dud. 'He's terrible,' an unnamed Jets defensive starter told the New York Daily News. Tebow claims he has worked hard in practice and improved significantly over the season. Other New York Jets players disagree. The 25-year-old quarterback was brought to New York as a possible replacement for struggling starter Mark Sanchez. But, even though Sanchez is having one of the worst seasons of his career, with the lowest passing rate in the league, teammates don't see him as a viable second option. 'We don't really have a choice,' left guard Matt Slauson told the paper of their continual use of Mark Sanchez as their quarterback. After Jets' 28-7 loss in Seattle on Sunday which featured Tebow in limited use, cornerback Antonio Cromartie said that anyone calling for Tebow to take over 'can kiss my ass.' Reacting to his teammates' scathing criticisms on Wednesday, Tebow admitted feeling 'some frustration and I guess some sadness' to the Daily News. 'You’re human. It’s not always fun having people saying negative things about you, but you try to be stronger from it. It always has made me stronger in the past and it will continue to make me stronger,' he said. But Sanchez’ arm is hardly anything to boast of, according to NFL statistics, where the quarterback shows the lowest NFL ranking among completion percentages – 52 per cent – and first for four red-zone interceptions. Cannibalism: Tebow, pictured behind quarterback Mark Sanchez, right, has been criticized by his teammates and others within the Jets organization as 'terrible' and having shown no improvement . Outspoken critics: Matt Slauson, left, and Antonio Cromartie, right, have both spoken critically of Tebow when expressing their thoughts on swapping Mark Sanchez out for him more . Tebow, the most popular non-starting quarterback in the league's history, reports Pro-Football Talk, has yet to score for the team in nine games played since his trade from the Broncos in March. ‘We don’t look at him as a quarterback,’ another starter told the paper. ‘He’s the Wildcat guy.’ Perhaps further backing Slauson’s opinion on plays, when Jets Head Coach Rex Ryan was asked his thoughts on swapping in Tebow for Sanchez - following Sanchez' completion of just nine of 22 passes against the Seattle Seahawks - Ryan was animated when telling NFL reporters he'd hear nothing of it. Cowards: Head Coach Rex Ryan said he's addressed the team's criticisms, especially on those said anonymously which he described as cowardly . 'I believe we can win with Mark. And I believe we can win with Tebow, but I'm not going to let you or anybody else convince me out of it, OK? ... He gives us the best opportunity to win games, and that's the only reason I make any move,' he said. Ryan told the paper he 'absolutely' addressed the Daily News’ report with his team on Wednesday morning, calling the attacks 'cowardly.' 'I think it’s a cowardly thing. If you’re not going to put your name to it, I think that’s about as cowardly of a thing as there is,' he said. On his little use of Tebow - sidelined for an average of seven out of eight plays - he said: 'I absolutely wanted Tim here ... I was very honest from Day 1, and . I've never gotten off that.' He added having mixed agreement with Slauson's words but respect for him not hiding behind them. With a dreary 3-6 game season, contributed by their Seahawks loss, the Jets currently face missing the postseason for what would be the second consecutive year. To some their absence could name them all 'terrible,' or at least those playing.","Tebow admitted feeling 'some frustration and I guess some sadness' to reports .

A grieving mother was involved in a dramatic courtroom row with a drug dealer because she was desperate to know who gave him the ecstasy that killed her 16-year old daughter. Drugs counsellor Diana Harding, 47, called Thomas Donelan, 20, a 'coward' as he stayed tight lipped at a Stockport inquest into the death of college student Serena Harding. Serena collapsed shortly after taking MDMA  - pure ecstasy - 'bombs' bought from Donelan - but although he was jailed for two years this year, he still refused to say where he got the drugs from. In an emotional exchange Mrs Harding, from Warrington, Cheshire, confronted Donelan as she stood in the witness box. Confrontation: Heartbroken mother Diana Harding called Thomas Donelan a 'coward' during her daughter's inquest because he failed to say who supplied the drugs that killed her child Serena . Tragic: Serena Harding, 16, was found dead after taking ecstasy last year - the first time she had taken it . She said: 'Does it not trouble you that the people who sold you this drug are going out spreading this all over the place? 'More people will die like my daughter. She would have had a future she would have had a life. Does this not prick your conscience? 'It’s these low life you are working for. They don’t tell you what goes into it what you are buying. Do you not want to stop this? You be a coward.' But Donelan replied: 'I won’t tell you where I got it from. I can’t tell you. It is not an issue of having a conscience. It is not in any disrespect of this girl’s memory. Distraught: Diana and Kenny Harding, parents of Serena Harding, arriving at Stockport Coroners court for the inquest . 'I’m sorry. If I knew they were going to come into your daughter’s hands I wouldn’t have sold it.' The hearing was told Serena who studied fashion and design at Warrington Collegiate took the £20 drug for the very first time on August 21 last year to impress a boy she had a crush on during an afternoon out with friends at Reddish Vale Country Park. Criminal:Thomas Donelan, pictured outside court in February this year, was jailed for two years for drugs offences . The youngster who suffered from Chron's disease which affected her immune system wallowed around one quarter of a gram of the class A party drug-known for being pure ecstasy and began having seizures. She died later in hospital. Her mother Diana told the Stockport inquest: #It was such a horrendous shock. I still don’t believe it now that she would have taken it. 'She swore to me that she would never take drugs as she knew what I did. I had mentioned most drugs to her, I never thought she would because of how ill she was. 'I had spoken to her and she knew the dangers. I also told her that alcohol was even more dangerous statistically and I wondered whether she understood that properly or misinterpreted it.' Mrs Harding said she felt her daughter had succumbed to peer pressure . 'If someone talks about something with a lot of enthusiasm and how wonderful it was and she was not feeling wonderful. 'She just wanted to be a normal girl like her friends. They may not have realised it was peer pressure but it was.' Tragedy struck when Serena arranged over Facebook to buy crystal MDMA with 19-year old Michael Millington whom she was besotted with. He described the drug to her as a 'very positive and safe experience'. They and friends bought the drugs from Donelan at a house but after taking them at the 397 acre park she complained of being thirsty then collapsed struggling from breath on a bench underneath a railway viaduct. Millington told the hearing: 'I think I was naively bigging up the drug. I don’t know but that may have had an influence on her. I had not known Serena to use MDMA previously. Serena bought the same amount as us, and paid £20. 'Up to that point, her health, she seemed fine. She said she was a bit thirsty so I went and got her some water. She was behaving normally. I felt okay I had used MDMA previously and didn’t feel any different. Next thing she was collapsed on a bench.' Scene: Miss Harding collapsed at Reddish Vale country park in Stockport and was found under a bench by a passer by who called an ambulance . Last July Donelan from Levenshulme, Manchester was later locked away for supplying drugs. Millington, from Lymm, Cheshire was given a 12 months suspended sentence and Dean Williams, 18, of Stockport was given a six month suspended term. At the time a judge said he and his friends were 'misguided individuals who believed and were part of a culture who believed that taking drugs such as ecstasy and MDMA is harmless.' Recording a verdict of misadventure Coroner John Pollard said: 'Serena by no means was a habitual drug user. This was one of the first times she had tried drugs. She was a young girl who had an awful lot to put up with because of the Chron’s Disease and the effects it had on her. 'It is the embarrassment of having it as a young girl, it is a very difficult condition and the drugs prescribed made her put weight on. 'She may well have had a crush on this guy, what is certain is that she was led by others who were older and more experiences in ways of the world. On this particular occasion she did what she did to be seen to be part of the gang. 'It is quite clear that she had not done it before, she was not a regular user and this was her first time trying it. 'Enormous lessons must be learnt which may help another family. I would make the plea to anybody who may be thinking of trying it- you simply don’t know the purity or strength and you do not know the affects it will have on you. 'Bring into the mix someone who not in the most robust of health there are serious questions to be considered. There is no evidence that anyone made her take this drug. I think she was a willing participant and they all went to the address and all took some. 'Serena took this drug for the affect of the drug , she took it willingly with the intent of getting the buzz.' In an interview after her daughter’s death Mrs Harding said: 'If my daughter could do it then somebody else’s daughter could. Television makes out like it is fashionable to take drugs, a right of passage, but no drug is safe.' 'When I got to A and E they showed me into a side room and I knew it was very serious. sat there hugging my knees and asked if my daughter was alive. They said no. It was the worst day of my life.' 'People have a stereotypical idea of what people who take drugs are like, but anybody can have a slip up. 'No mother should have to see their daughter lying dead on a medical table. Serena was out of her depth. For a mad moment she said ‘go on then’ and paid with her life.'","Diana Harding confronted Thomas Donelan during her daughter Serena's inquest .

Acknowledgement: German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble has officially signed off on revisions to the original 1952 compensation treaty for holocaust survivors . Germany has announced plans to increase pension payments to Holocaust survivors as they enter their final years. It comes sixty years after a landmark accord started German government compensation for victims of Nazi crimes. Most Holocaust survivors experienced extreme trauma as children, suffered serious malnutrition, and lost almost all of their relatives - leaving them today with severe psychological and medical problems, and little or no family support network to help them cope. In acknowledgement of that, German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble  has officially signed off  on revisions to the original 1952 compensation treaty. It will increase pensions for those living in eastern Europe and broaden who is eligible for payments. Contributions to home care for survivors have already been increased. Julius Berman, chairman of the Conference on Jewish  Material Claims Against Germany, said: 'Survivors are passing away on a daily basis but the other side is that individual survivors are needing more help than ever. 'While a person came out of the camps very young and eventually developed a life of their own over the years, the impact of what happened at the beginning is now coming to the fore. 'Whether it's mentally or physically, they're sicker than their peers of the same age' Germany has paid - primarily to Jewish survivors - some 70 billion euros in compensation overall for Nazi crimes since the agreement was signed in 1952. In one change to the treaty that Germany agreed to earlier this year, the country will provide compensation payments to a new category of Nazi victims - some 80,000 Jews who fled ahead of the advancing German army and mobile killing squads and eventually resettled in the former Soviet Union. On November 1, they became eligible for one-time payments of  2,556 euros. The amendment also formalizes an increase in pensions for Holocaust survivors living in formerly communist eastern Europe to the same as those living elsewhere -  an icrease to 300 euro per month - from the 200 to 260 euro they had been receiving. Lasting legacy: Most Holocaust survivors experienced extreme trauma as children, suffered serious malnutrition, and lost almost all of their relatives (Pictured prisoners of the Dachau Concentration Camp) Germany is set to increase the pensions for holocaust survivors. Picture taken in 1942 shows Jewish deportees in the Drancy transit camp, their last stop before the German concentration camps . Schaeuble said on Inforadio before the signing ceremony at Berlin's Jewish Museum that once Germany and the Claims Conference had identified the additional victims living in the east, it was only natural to include them in the compensation agreement. 'We still do not know the names of all of the victims,' Schaeuble said. 'The crimes of the Holocaust were so inconceivably enormous that you can't know all of the victims or those with claims, so you have to adjust it again and again.' Germany already increased payments this year for home care for Holocaust survivors by 15 percent over 2011, and has pledged to raise that further in 2013 and 2014. Compensation has been ever evolving since the 1952 agreement, with annual negotiations between the Claims Conference and the German government on who should receive funds and how much will be paid. Yet, even 67 years after the end of World War II, there is much to set right, said Stuart Eizenstat, the former U.S. ambassador to the European Union who serves as the Claims Conference's special negotiator. 'One of the things that drives me is that with all of that, the best surveys out there are there are probably 500,000 survivors alive today worldwide and half of them are in poverty or very close to the poverty line,' he said. 'This is an ongoing responsibility - this is not the end of the road.' Eizenstat said it is a tribute to Germany and officials there that the country continues to acknowledge responsibility for Nazi-era crimes - both with the compensation payments and also in its actions. 'I was very much taken by the degree to which they had come to terms with World War II and were dealing with its consequences, through mandatory Holocaust education; through seemingly small, but important, things like putting plaques in front of homes of Jews who had been expelled; by building a monumental above-ground Holocaust memorial right in the center of reunified Berlin,' he said. 'It's a very sharp contrast to what Japan has done in recognizing their responsibilities... it's quite striking.' Conference chairman Berman said the fact that the German government decided to host an event to announce the latest results of negotiations with the Claims Conference at a Berlin event shows it remains committed. 'To me the most significant part of this event ... is that the German government wanted it ... telling again not only the whole world but more importantly telling the German people that it's not over,' he said.","Announced 60 years after first payout for Holocaust survivors .

Now Kit Williams, creator of the Masquerade mystery, has challenged the public to another riddle – and this time even he doesn’t know the answer. The artist is appealing for the return of a bracelet made by him which was stolen by burglars 18 months ago, the only other piece of jewellery he ever made aside from his iconic golden hare amulet. Missing: Artist Kit Williams is desperate to see the return of his precious 22 carat gold bracelet which was stolen and a £5,000 reward is on offer for its return . The hare gained cult status after he . buried it in the ground 33 years ago and published a children’s book . containing clues as to its whereabouts. It is currently on display at the . Victoria and Albert Museum as part of an exhibition of the best British . designs of the 20th and 21st centuries. A reward of £5,000 has been offered to anyone who can find the bracelet, which was created soon after the hare amulet. Mystery: Those who searched for the elusive golden hare from the 1970s Masquerade mystery will finally be able to see it up close - when it goes on public display for the very first time . Popular: Williams's children's story Masquerade was a publishing sensation, selling almost a million copies when it appeared in 1979 . Williams, now 65, crafted the gold . bangle, featuring a frog and a linnet, for a friend to give to his wife . as an anniversary present. But it was taken when thieves raided the couple's home in Gloucestershire– and now it is feared it may be lost forever. Although it may have been melted down for scrap metal, the artist hopes it may still exist somewhere in Britain. He said: 'The burglars may well have . been kids or drug addicts. 'They probably just picked it up because it . was small and easy to carry away. I'm certain they had no idea what it . was. 'The most likely scenario is that it . has been melted down for scrap metal. 'My only hope is that someone at . the gold processors twigged that it was more interesting than just a bit . of gold and decided to preserve it. 'It's the only piece of jewellery I've . ever made aside from the golden hare, but I'd be surprised if it still . exists. 'They had no way of knowing it was made by me so won't know the . significance.' The bracelet, which is made of 100grms . of 22 carat gold, is engraved with the phrase, 'I am Love Eternal, no . manacle made of me.' On display: The amulet, created by artist Kit Williams, is to be shown at the Victoria and Albert museum as part of a new design exhibition. In a rare interview, he said he was glad his fans would finally have the chance to see it . Reunited: Kit Williams and Bamber Gasgoine, riight, with the Golden Hare that they buried together in 1979 . Williams made it for his Dutch friend . in 1984, along with an oval casket made from mahogany and a garnet set . on top which would open the container if moved in a certain way. The two animals make up the clasp, with the linnet carrying a ruby on its head which would open the bracelet when pressed. Williams said the couple, who want to remain anonymous, are offering the reward because it is of deep sentimental value to them. Finders keepers: Poster promoting the finding the hare in the 1970s - the hare was the prize for winning the puzzle from the book Masquerade by Kit Williams . He added: 'There is a special story . that I created to accompany the bracelet. 'There's a saying that the frog . is the Dutchman's nightingale, I suppose because it's quite marshy in . Holland. 'So the story is that a frog and a . linnet decide to have a singing contest – and against all odds, the frog . wins. Why? Because the judge was a Dutchman.' Williams's children's story Masquerade was a publishing sensation, selling almost a million copies when it appeared in 1979. Among the illustrations and story, he inserted clues to locate a golden hare amulet – which he buried in a field himself. But though two physics teachers . cracked the puzzle in 1982, they were beaten to the treasure by a . fraudster, who appeared to have found the hiding place through his . connection with Williams' girlfriend. The hare was eventually auctioned in December 1988, and sold for £31,900 to an unknown buyer in the Far East. It was only recently that the current owner came forward, and agreed to loan it to the Victoria and Albert museum. In a rare interview when the Masquerade Hare went on public display, its creator said he was glad his fans would finally have the chance to see it. Williams said: ‘The idea was to bury something in the cold wet earth. It was the romance of it, that whatever people were doing, that jewel was waiting for them. ‘It hasn’t been seen by the British public before, as it was taken out of the ground by a rather dubious man who didn’t want to show it. ‘The amulet looks the same as when I made it, although some of the green stones have turned black after being preserved in wax while underground. ‘The current owner is very nice, I have met her and I’m glad she’s got it. She didn’t realise it had this other life. ‘She’s delighted that it’s going on display in Britain.’ Williams lives in Gloucestershire with his wife, Eleyne, and paints for a living.

They were inseparable for almost 30 years, travelling the world together climbing its toughest peaks. But now Julie-Ann Clyma is having to adjust to life without her beloved husband Roger Payne, 55, who two weeks ago was leading a group up a peak when he and eight others were swept away by the 'deadliest Alps avalanche in years'. Close friends John Taylor, 48, and Steve . Barber, 47, who lived on the same street in the village of Poppleton, . near York, died alongside Mr Payne on the 4,649ft Mont Maudit, when a block of snow 60ft high and 500ft wide hit them in the early hours of Thursday, July 12. Inseparable: Roger Payne and his beloved wife Julie-Ann Clyma on the summit of 6376m Mount Grosvenor in China . Mr Payne has been described as a climber born 'with boot-shaped feet', intent on treading lightly and respectfully, always carrying down any rubbish he found left on mountains and careful not to take risks with himself or the climbers he helped guide for a living. On one occasion in 1993, on K2, he even found and carried down bones and clothing belonging to American Art Gilkey, who was also swept to his death by an . avalanche in 1953. Mr Payne was also the first person to ascent Mount Grosvenor in China, Khan Tengri . and Pobeda in Kazakhstan, and throughout most of his 30-year career he had one . constant beside him, his beloved wife Julie-Ann. 'I loved being with him, we did so much together, I feel so lucky to have had those years with him,' she told MailOnline today. 'Honestly, I am not sure how I will feel, but I am fairly sure I will go back to work in the mountains. 'I . live in the mountains, they are all around me, and they hold so many . good memories for me, of Roger. It was too much a part of both our . lives. It would be difficult to walk away from that.' Adventurers: The husband and wife team travelled the world climbing mountains, pictured here in China doing what they loved . Tragedy: Roger Payne, pictured with his wife Julie-Ann Clyma, died in the avalanche along with 8 others . Together the couple of 27 years set up a successful mountaineering company that ran tours across the Alps while also exploring mountains around the world on their own. 'We had big plans to reach unclimbed summits and find new routes but it . was always with the understanding that the conditions could change at . any minute. 'It was always more important to be safe and turn . around and come back rather than keep going and take a risk with our . lives. We always had a very practical approach. For us, being together . was the most important thing. 'In our personal climbing we . wanted to say that we had pushed ourselves to the limit and achieved . things that we knew we were capable of. 'But in our work lives . the safety and security of people we took up mountains was so important. Whatever they wanted to climb, we would always do everything we could . to make sure that we would bring them back, and be safe ourselves.' But there was nothing he could do when the deadly avalanche struck the group of 28 climbers. Born adventurer: Roger Payne loved nothing more than climbing, especially with his wife by his side . Another summit: Roger Payne on the slopes beneath the summit of Chomolhari 7328m, Tibet . 'That . is what is so sad about what happened when Roger, Steve and John died,' Ms Clyma said. 'It was a place that had brought them so much joy, where they had been so . safe for so long. It is difficult to come to terms with the fact that . it happened this way. 'It was a freak accident. I know that, and that is why it is very hard to cope with.' Mr Payne, who had developed an avalanche . training programme, met his future wife, then a climbing . instructor from New Zealand, on a mountain in South America. They married in 1987 and lived in a chalet in Leysin, Switzerland, in the Alps. 'We . met on an expedition at a base camp party that Roger’s team mates had . organised. That was in 1985. I guess it was our love of mountaineering that . brought us together and two years later we married,' she said. Natural born climber: Roger Payne exploratory mountaineering in Sikkim, India . Success: Mr Payne during the descent of Mount Grosvenor in China . Speaking for the first time after his death, she has paid tribute to her 'generous and loving' husband. 'He was not like anyone else. We were together for 27 years and I feel like I learnt a huge amount from him,' she told MailOnline. 'He . was a very good man, an extremely generous and loving man. Even after . 27 years I still admired him and he inspired me. He was always thinking . of what he would do next.' In 1999 on the infamous Pumari Chhish peak in Pakistan the pair were trapped on the mountain's edge by avalanches and snow storms, which they were lucky to escape. 'We . were trying to find a new route and had put up tents on a ridge and . then it just began to snow for days. We couldn't get up or down. Killed: Steve Barber, left, and John Taylor, who both died in the avalanche, were lifelong best friends who lived on the same street in Upper Poppleton, Yorkshire . Tragedy: Experienced climber Roger Payne was . killed by the avalanche in the Alps. On the right, he is pictured during . a climb in the Himalayas . 'We . waited for a break in the weather and we tried to get back down. Then . incredibly really the sun burnt through and up there it can go from very . cold to extremely warm very quickly. 'This caused a small . avalanche, that led to a big one which hit us. Luckily we had fixed a . rope to the ridge above and luckily they held us when the avalanche hit . us. 'That was probably the closest call we ever had. It did make us think.' His tearful 91-year-old mother Nellie Payne, of Hammersmith, West London, said it best when she spoke about her son and his wife just after he died. ‘They were made for each other,’ she said. ‘They had a lovely life. Now Julie is all by herself and I don’t know what she will do.’ It appears that she now has an answer, Julie-Ann will continue to do what the inseparable  couple both loved to do together - climb mountains.

A mine shaft has collapsed leaving a 75ft-wide crater in back gardens forcing families to flee their homes. Eight houses had to be evacuated after the hole opened up while a drilling rig was being used to cap the former iron ore mine with concrete. A worker had to be rescued as he was harnessed to the machine and became trapped in the shaft. Scroll down for video . Devastation: The scene in Cumbria where a mine collapsed creating an 80ft-deep hole in the gardens of terraced houses . The incident happened while a drilling rig, pictured, was being used to cap the disused mining shaft with concrete . Police were called out to Egremont in West Cumbria at 1.30pm yesterday after reports of the collapse. It is believed the drilling rig fell around 50ft into the shaft which caused a huge hole to open up about 75ft wide. The site was being monitored after reports of some land slippage over the past few months. Inspector Phil Davidson, of Cumbria police, said the houses had been evacuated by Copeland council for health and safety reasons. The area has been been cordoned off and security provided by a private contractor. Drivers have been urged by police to avoid the area. There are no reports of anyone being hurt. Ryan Rickerby saved the worker who was trapped in the 80ft-deep hole after the machinery he was in plunged into the ground. He witnessed the incident from his . kitchen window, as the area being worked on lies at the bottom of his . garden on Howbank Road in the town. Mr Rickerby , 25, said: 'I was washing up in the kitchen and my window looks right on to my garden, and the garden is happening behind. All of a sudden, the garden literally just fell into the ground. 'There was a huge cloud of dust and a loud rumble and when I could see what happened, I realised the floor had literally just fallen through. 'There were lots of workmen around at the time, and I heard one of them shouting, so I went outside to see what was going on. Parts of the gardens, including fences, collapsed into the hole and eight homes had to be evacuated .

It’s a miracle no-one was hurt.' Mr Rickerby, a pipe fitter at Sellafield Nuclear Plant in Cumbria, is not able to get back into his house after he and his father were evacuated yesterday afternoon when the ground collapsed. Linda Clarke, 58, who also lives on Howbank Road, said: 'There’s a lot of speculation as to why the ground collapsed - people are saying it’s due to the amount of rain we have had, leaving the ground really soft, but we’re not sure.

Alun Cairns has written to its chief executive, David Abraham, asking how a programme fronted by the actor ‘will ever comply with Ofcom’s rules about impartiality’. Mr Grant, who has become the public face of the Hacked Off pressure group demanding Press reform, is making the documentary. Scroll down for video .

The production company, Films of Record, was founded by Roger Graef, who is its chief executive. He was, until yesterday, also chairman of the Media Standards Trust, which founded Hacked Off. In his letter, which has been copied to Ofcom chief Ed Richards, Tory MP Mr Cairns says he is ‘extremely concerned’ about the programme. He details the links between Mr Grant, the production company and the MST which, the politician points out, has ‘produced a series of recommendations for a system of statutory regulation of the Press which Hacked Off and Hugh Grant support’. Mr Cairns continues: ‘The celebrity spokesman of Hacked Off making the case for the implementation of the MST’s proposals is none other than Hugh Grant – the chosen celebrity presenter of the programme. It is little wonder why he accepted the very kind invitation from Films of Record to front the programme.’ On the campaign trail: Actor Hugh Grant, pictured with Lib Dem Dr Evan Harris, right, and journalist John Kampher, left, at a Hacked Off meeting .

Mr Cairns quotes Ofcom’s Broadcasting Code which states broadcasters ‘should not give undue prominence to the views of particular persons or bodies on matters of political or industrial controversy and matters relating to current public policy’.

Drowned: Rabbi Berish Englander died while performing his daily cleansing ritual in the sea near Aberystwyth . A Rabbi drowned in rough seas while performing a Jewish bathing ritual on the first day of his holiday. Company director Dov Berish Englander, 47, who was married with 11 children, was on a two-week break with his family and other members of the Orthodox Jewish community when the accident happened. He had gone waist-deep into the sea off Aberystwyth, West Wales, with one of his sons and other Jewish men to perform the ‘mikveh’ ritual, which involves immersing themselves in water for purification. But while his friends returned to shore, Mr Englander, who was the director of a property business in Stamford Hill, North London, as well as running a rabbinical college, was dragged under by a large wave. Aberystwyth Coroner’s Court was told that witnesses saw Mr Englander begin shouting and frantically waving his arms for help as he struggled against the waves. Holidaymaker David Keating said that he and his girlfriend were walking along the seafront at 7.55am on August 2 when they noticed the men in the sea. ‘We watched them undress a little and . dip in and out of the water,’ Mr Keating said. ‘I saw one of them go in . further. He was in for a bit before realising he was in trouble. He . tried waving and shouting out to the others for help.’ Accident: The rabbi was staying at the scenic seaside town of Aberystwyth in West Wales when tragedy struck . Accident: Paramedics tried to resuscitate him but he was declared dead at Bronglais General Hospital, Aberystwyth . The couple struggled to pull a life-ring from its box on the seafront, while a friend of Mr Englander went back into the water to help. Another witness, Christopher Tapp, said: ‘I went down with the ring to try to save the gentleman. I think the rope got tangled in the panic to get it out of the box, but the man was too far out and I couldn’t throw it far enough to reach him. ‘He was in the water with his hands in the air, calling for help, but the waves kept pushing the ring back. 'Then he was lying face down in the water and drifting.’ When asked by coroner Peter Brunton whether he would have gone swimming that morning, Mr Tapp replied: ‘No, it was too rough.’ Mr Englander, who had two granddaughters, was educated in Antwerp, Belgium, and Israel. He met his wife, Baila Rochel, in New York in the mid-1980s. Mrs Englander, whose children are aged between 22 years and 19 months, said: ‘He was a true pillar of the community, loved and respected by so many. He would give so much to charity and would do anything to help anyone, but would never boast.’ Thousands attended Mr Englander’s  funeral, with some travelling from as far as the US and Israel.A post-mortem examination found that Mr Englander drowned. Mr Brunton recorded a verdict of accidental death. MOST religious Jews in Britain who perform the mikveh ritual do so in small tiled pools built at community centres or Jewish colleges, which are filled with warm rainwater. If by the coast, however, the ritual can be performed in the sea. Mikveh water has to be natural - either rain, spring or sea water. Immersion symbolises a change of status, the idea being that those who enter as impure, emerge purified. The actual dipping involves standing in the water and immersing the whole body underneath the surface. Those undergoing the ritual have to be completely clean. In the hours before, people bathe, brush their teeth, use tooth picks, cut their nails, remove all make-up, nail polish and contact lenses so there are no barriers between them and the water.Some ultra-Orthodox men perform the mikveh every day. Jewish people have been performing the ritual in the UK since at least the 13th century. The Hebrew word mikveh literally translates as a ‘collection’, referring to the collection of water.","Friends and passers-by were unable to save him .

In a particularly bold move, it has now paid out more than £400,000 on a Barack Obama win - before votes were counted. Paddy Power decided the election was 'a done deal' and said 'the punters had called it' after noticing that more than 75 per cent of money coming in was going Obama's way. The firm took out an advert in the Irish Times that read: 'Sorry Romney, you're not black or cool. We're paying out early on an Obama victory.' Cheeky: The bookmaker announced it was paying out for an Obama win before votes had even been counted. Pictured, the controversial advert in the Irish Times . President Obama last night swept to a comfortable win over Republican candidate Mitt Romney, easily surpassing the 270 electoral votes he needed. He told a rally of cheering supporters in Washington that 'the best is yet to come' for the U.S. His convincing win comes after he led the country through its biggest economic challenges since the Great Depression of the 1930s, as well as dealing with the fall-out of Superstorm Sandy over the past ten days. Paddy Power announced that the Democrat's win was a 'nailed-on certainty' after odds fell to a low 2/9. Red, white and blue: President Barack Obama is obscured by a hail of confetti at his election rally in Chicago after securing a second term in office . A Paddy Power spokesperson said: 'Romney gave it a good shot and is doing well in the popular vote, but we suspect he’s had his moment in the sun and is likely to be remembered more for his legendary gaffes than Presidential potential. 'The overall betting trend has shown one-way traffic for Obama and punters seemed to have called it 100 per cent correct. Despite Romney appealing to the large evangelical and senior vote, America’s sticking with black and cool.' The ad has attracted the attention of the Advertising Standards Authority of Ireland, after a complaint that it is prejudiced, and the ASAI is following it up with Paddy Power. 'Best to come': President Obama celebrated a comfortable win over Republican candidate Mitt Romney . Paddy Power has made its fascination with the 44th president of the United States clear before. When Obama visited Ireland in May 2011, it renamed 13 of its shops 'Obama Power' and took bets on which pub the president would visit to drink a pint of Guinness. In 2008, the bookies again went for shock-tactics by offering 12-1 odds the President would not finish his first term in office. It later confirmed it would pay out if Obama were killed by a sniper, according to the Irish Independent. Two years ago, Paddy Power fell foul of the law after erecting gigantic Hollywood-style letters spelling out its name beside Celtic Manor Golf Course during the Ryder Cup. In the same year, the company paid £10,000 to sponsor a confession box in a Catholic church, branding it with the Paddy Power logo and renaming it the 'sin bin.'","The president last night secured a second term in office .

The BBC will use this year's Children in Need to address the Jimmy Savile scandal - but will not mention the disgraced presenter by name. BBC executives will be keeping a close eye on the public response to its flagship annual charity fundraising programme which airs on Friday. The appeal is likely to be seen as a test of support for the corporation in light of the successive scandals that have rocked it over the past six weeks. Scroll down for video . This year's Children In Need will again be hosted by Terry Wogan, pictured here with an armful of Pudsey bears, and is expected to include a reference to the Savile Scandal . Sir Terry Wogan will once again present the show, which last year raised a record £46million. The Savile revelations and the fallout from the shelved Newsnight report about the late Jim'll Fix It star will inevitably cast a shadow over this year's six-hour fundraiser on BBC1 and BBC2. The BBC said the programme would be 'even bigger and better than ever' with guests including Girls Aloud, One Direction, Olympics and Paralympics stars and Sir Alan Sugar, who will appear in a special edition of EastEnders. BBC sources told The Guardian the programme would make reference to 'recent events that have been covered in the press' but it is not expected to specifically mention Savile. The appeal will also carry a film reflecting the work of charities that help the victims of abuse. 'There will be some kind of reference to recent events that have been covered in the Press quite extensively,' said a BBC insider. 'It will also say that Children in Need does and always has supported children who were the victims of abuse and will continue to support the amazing work that these charities do. Scandal: Savile appeared on the telethon in 1984, 1987 and 1989 . Last year the charity fundraising event chalked up a record £46million . Wogan (left) will be joined by BBC presenters Fearne Cotton, Tess Daly (right) and new Radio 1 breakfast DJ Nick Grimshaw . 'There will be a film to reflect that, and there was one on the same subject last year.' Sir Roger Jones, the former chairman of Children in Need, revealed last month that Savile was secretly banned from the Children in Need appeal for being ‘creepy’. Though . still revered elsewhere at the corporation, the presenter was kept away . from the annual fundraiser because of 'rumours' of his interest in . young girls. Savile appeared on the telethon in 1984, . 1987 and 1989, before Sir Roger became chairman. A member of the board . of governors between 1996 and 2002, Sir Roger said he would have stepped . down from his charity role if Savile had become involved. The BBC has also suffered a slump in trust among licence-fee payers as a result of the Savile scandal and the ensuing crisis over an inaccurate Newsnight report about an alleged child abuser, which led to the resignation of director general George Entwistle on Saturday. The former judge who is leading a BBC inquiry into the Jimmy Savile sexual abuse scandal has launched an appeal for witnesses. Dame Janet Smith, who is reviewing the corporation's practices during the Savile years, has called on potential victims, witnesses, people who worked with the TV presenter and senior staff at the time to assist with the investigation. According to the inquiry's website, the review also wants to hear from people 'who were familiar with the culture or practices of the BBC' in terms of 'preventing or enabling the sexual abuse of children, young people or teenagers'. Savile became hugely famous during the 1960s and 1970s as a BBC Radio 1 DJ and presenter of Jim'll Fix It on BBC1. He worked for the BBC between 1964 and approximately 2007, according to the review's website. But Savile, who died last year at the age of 84, is now believed to have been one of the UK's most prolific abusers, with hundreds of possible victims. A YouGov poll published on Tuesday . found that for the first time since it began tracking support for . British institutions in 2003, more respondents distrust BBC journalists . (47 per cent) than trust them (44 per cent). YouGov . reported a slump of 13 percentage points in trust in BBC journalism the . past fortnight – suggesting the corporation's reputation has been . harmed more by the inaccurate Newsnight report and Entwistle's . resignation than by earlier revelations about Savile. BBC insiders said Savile would be the 'elephant in the room' during this year's appeal, but people working on the show stressed that it would be 'business as usual to make the very best programme we can make so the viewers really enjoy it'. A former chairman of Children In Need, Sir Roger Jones, said last month that the charity had made a decision to keep Savile away from the event because he had suspicions about the Top of the Pops presenter. Jones, a former BBC governor for Wales, said he always felt Savile was a 'pretty creepy sort of character … we took the decision that we didn't want him anywhere near the charity and we just stepped up our child protection policies ,which again would have put him at risk if he tried anything'. Wogan will be joined by BBC presenters Fearne Cotton, Tess Daly and new Radio 1 breakfast DJ Nick Grimshaw. This year's appeal will be executive produced by Clare Pizey. A BBC spokesman said: 'Our aim this year, like every year, is to raise as much money as possible and we are on track to raise millions to help change lives of disadvantaged children across the UK. 'BBC Children in Need has a strong track record of funding projects with a specific focus on supporting children and young people who are at risk of, or have experienced, some form of sexual abuse. 'On Friday night, the show will feature a number of films based on the work we fund to help disadvantaged children and young people in the UK, this will include some of our work helping the victims of sexual abuse, as was the case last year.' Last year's Children in Need, featuring bandaged mascot Pudsey Bear, raised £46million, taking to more than £650million the amount of money it has generated since its first broadcast in 1980. Girls Aloud have recorded this year's Children In Need single, Something New. Friday night's programme will also feature special editions of Strictly Come Dancing, Top Gear and Doctor Who, and Pudsey the dog, winner of ITV1's Britain's Got Talent, meeting his Children In Need namesake.","Insiders say Savile will be the 'elephant in the room' on this year's show .

Andrew Marr yesterday admitted his wife was ‘very cross’ with him after pictures emerged of him in an intimate clinch with another woman. Suitcase in hand, the BBC broadcaster left the family home he shares with his wife of 25 years Jackie Ashley and their three children yesterday lunchtime. But the 53-year-old – who last year admitted having an affair with a fellow journalist – insisted he had not been ordered to pack his bags, saying: ‘No, no, not at all. But I would say my wife is very cross with me and quite rightly so. ‘I am a grown-up and I should know better. It was very poor behaviour on my part and she is entirely right to be annoyed.’ Mr Marr, who was picked up from home by a taxi, said he was travelling to America to make a programme on President Obama. Asked if there would be making up to do on his return, after images emerged in a Sunday tabloid showing him kissing and fondling another woman, Mr Marr said: ‘Well we will have to see.’ The clinch occurred in the early hours of Saturday after the former BBC political editor and fellow journalists had been drinking at a central London bar to mark the completion of his latest BBC series – History of The World. A fellow reveller spotted Mr Marr and the woman, a colleague, kissing against a fence at 2.30am outside The Bar, in Fitzrovia. ‘I spotted them hugging and kissing up against the fence,’ said the witness. ‘They were there for a few minutes. Eventually they went back into the bar and stayed until closing time.’ Speaking yesterday, Mr Marr said it was just a drunken clinch, and denied any suggestions he was having an affair. He said: ‘I am really embarrassed and so annoyed with myself. It was just a goodbye clinch. Hug: The pair embrace on the street near the London bar. Mr Marr described it as a drunken clinch . Drunken farewell: Mr Marr slips his hand inside the woman's jeans, before drawing her closer for a kiss, right . Long marriage: Marr with his wife Jackie, to whom he has been married for 25 years . ‘It had been a long drunken evening and it was just a silly thing. It was just two drunken journalists having a farewell clinch after working fantastically hard together for two years. There is no romantic connection between us. There never has been and never will be.’ In an exclusive interview with the Daily Mail in April last year, the broadcaster revealed he had obtained a gagging order to hush up an extra-marital affair with another journalist. At the time, he said he felt embarrassed about his attempts to conceal his infidelity, admitting: ‘I did not come into journalism to go around gagging journalists.’ He won a High Court injunction in January 2008 to suppress reports of the relationship. At the time, he believed he had fathered a child with the woman. He also made maintenance payments – until he discovered through a DNA test that he was not the girl’s father. Mr Marr met Guardian columnist Miss Ashley, 57, the daughter of Lord Ashley of Stoke, in 1986. She declined to comment yesterday.

Insurers could be hit for billions of dollars more than expected after superstorm Sandy was labelled a post-tropical cyclone rather than a hurricane. Lowering the classification means the insurance providers have to pay more of the costs towards rebuilding the parts of New York and New Jersey which were damaged. Had Sandy been given hurricane status homeowners would have needed to contribute more towards their costs. Total rebuild: Insurers will have to pay for houses like these, in area near the coast which burned down during a fire in the midst of the storm, to be rebuilt without claiming hurricane deductions . The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's National Weather Service (NWS) made the call which has been contested by insurers, who are estimated to lose between $10-20billion. 'In New York, New Jersey, by all sorts of normal measures, it was a hurricane,' Neil Alldredge, senior vice-president of state and policy affairs at the National Association of Mutual Insurance Companies, told the Financial Times. 'If you ask any one who lives [in New York or New Jersey] they will tell you it was a hurricane.' He continued: 'It’s ironic that the industry gets beaten up all the time about the way it hides behind policy language. Torn to pieces: A girl tries to recover some items from her parents house which was destroyed in the storm . 'It seems to me that this is what the states are doing: they’re hiding behind this technicality.' However they may succeed in their bid to challenge the determination of Sandy. Paul Berger, an attorney at the Hurricane Law Group, told the Financial Times: 'Most courts would have to take judicial notice of the determinations of NOAA and the post tropical declaration would be upheld. 'However, because so much money is involved, I would not be surprised to see the determination challenged.' A hurricane deductible is usually between 1 per cent and 5 per cent of the value of the property - which means homeowners would have to pay thousands of dollars before the insurers covered the rest. Shattered: Homeowner Chris Brady stands at a wall of windows damaged by Hurricane Sandy to watch snow fall . But a storm deductible is usually a fixed figure between $500 and $1000 - considerably less. For instance, if a house was valued at $400,000 a hurricane deductible could cost up to $20,000. The New York, Rhode Island, New Jersey, Connecticut Pennsylvania, Maryland and the District of Colombia jurisdictions have all already declared hurricane deductibles invalid. Individual insurance companies use different ways to decide whether storms are classified as hurricanes or not. Some use the NWS decision while others decide on an observed wind speed. The NWS's Hurricane Center says a hurricane is a tropical cyclone or rotating wind system with a minimum sustained surface wind speed of 74mph. Still standing: This house fared better than many during the storm which hit land at 8pm on October 29 . Even though maximum sustained wind speeds with Sandy were at 85mph when the classification changed the storm was downgraded because it had 'lost its tropical characteristics', according to the Hurricane Center. They labelled it a post-tropical cyclone at 7pm on October 29 - an hour before it hit land. Last week governors across the US states hit by Sandy said insurance companies should not charge hurricane deductibles. New York governor Andrew Cuomo said: 'Homeowners should not have to pay hurricane deductibles for damage caused by the storm and insurers should understand the Department of Financial Services will be monitoring how claims are handled.'","Insurance companies are contesting the decision to change Sandy's status .

Council bosses have taken down a Rochdale town hall plaque honouring Sir Cyril Smith - as six more people came forward to allege they were abused by the former MP. They say the tribute - which was put up last year - has had to come down after it was threatened with vandalism. Council leader Colin Lambert said he and chief executive Jim Taylor came to the decision to remove the plaque. A 'neutral act': The local council has removed the plaque to prevent vandalism . The tribute which was erected last year before the allegations came out . Rochdale Town Hall: Sir Cyril Smith was a renowned figure in local politics for over 40 years . Councillor Lambert said: 'We make no judgement on the situation with Cyril Smith, but the strength of public feeling is such that we have been alerted to a potential threat to the town hall.' Councillor Lambert said there had been internal discussions about the plaque since last week, when child abuse allegations against the former MP resurfaced. Appeal: Police have urged anyone who believes they were the victim of sexual abuse by former Liberal Democrat MP Sir Cyril Smith, pictured, to come forward . All six of the new allegations . against Sir Cyril Smith, who died in 2010, have been made to the office . of the town's current MP, Simon Danczuk.

He added: 'The nurse had come round to check us for nits... that sort of thing. Cyril was there.' The man went on to describe how Sir Cyril abused him. He added: 'I was scared. I didn't know what was going on. It makes me sick. I think it hasn't come out because of who he was. It's like Jimmy Savile - he was similar. In Rochdale, he was like that. 'He was Cyril Smith. He was almost godlike. He used to go around schools all the time. 'It was 'guess who's coming today, Cyril Smith is coming to see us all today so you'd better behave'. It was like he ran the place.'

Former House speaker Nancy Pelosi said today that she will run to keep her job, and appeared combative as a reporter asked a question in regard to the 72-year-old's age. While the mood in the room was predominantly light, tensions rose when the question was posed by NBC News reporter Luke Russert. Russert asked Pelosi about . the impact of her decision on a younger .

'What's your response?' At first, Pelosi shrugged off the question as her supporters blasted the question as 'age discrimination.' Provocative: Pelosi said a question from NBC News reporter Luke Russert about her age was 'offensive' But . then Russert asked again: 'No, excuse me. You, Mr Hoyer, Mr Clyburn, . you're all over 70.

You don't realize that, I . guess.' Eventually, however, Pelosi got the final word with an answer to the question: 'No.' Russert is the son of longtime Meet the Press host Tim Russert, who died suddenly of a heart attack in 2008. Pelosi said she would remain as Democratic leader in the House after a pair of elections that kept the party in the minority there even as Democrats gained seats in the Senate and a second term for President Obama. 'My colleagues made it very clear: ""Don't even think of leaving,""' she recalled at a news conference, surrounded by female lawmakers. 'I have made a decision to submit my name to my colleagues to once again serve as the House Democratic leader.' Republicans reacted to news of her decision to remain with scorn. 'There is no better person to preside over the most liberal House Democratic caucus in history than the woman who is solely responsible for relegating it to a prolonged minority status,' said Paul Lindsay, spokesman for the National Republican Campaign Committee. 'This decision signals that House Democrats have absolutely no interest in regaining the trust and confidence of the American people who took the speaker's gavel away from Nancy Pelosi in the first place,' he said. Pelosi has represented a San Francisco area district in the House, and was first woman in history to serve as speaker. The tea party-fueled political wave of 2010 forced the gavel from her hand to Rep John Boehner, an Ohio Republican. A little help from my friends: Female House Democrats applaud as Pelosi announces she will remain in the House . Speaker: Pelosi was succeeded as House speaker by Republican John Boehner of Ohio . Holding a news conference Wednesday morning, Pelosi said 'we're very, very proud' of how large a role women played in the November 6 election. 'We don't have the gavel' of majority . status in the House, she said, 'but we have unity. I think our caucus . this morning demonstrated that very clearly.' 'We must have the further empowerment . of women,' said Pelosi, who noted that when she came to Congress there . were 23 women in the House compared to over 60 of the seats in the . House. 'Not enough. We want more,' she said. Influence: Pelosi was a major force behind the passage of Obama's health care overhaul and the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act . Pelosi was a major force behind the passage of Obama's health care overhaul and the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act. Even after the 2010 elections, when her party lost 63 seats, Pelosi was reelected Democratic leader by her caucus. Pelosi's colleagues had said for days that the top leadership post was hers if she wanted it in the next Congress that begins in January. She refused to reveal her plans for a week after the November 6 elections failed to give Democrats gain they wanted. It was a disappointing, but not unexpected result of a bitter year of elections that focused on the tight contests for president and control of the Senate. Throughout, Pelosi raised millions of dollars for Democratic House candidates and insisted that the 25 seat gain was within reach. But in the end, Democrats will gain at most eight seats and Republicans will keep their majority. Waiting in the wings of Democratic ranks was Pelosi's deputy, Democratic Rep Steny Hoyer of Maryland, the party whip, whom she has known since they were congressional interns, and South Carolina Democrat James Clyburn, assistant to the Democratic leader. Pelosi is the daughter and sister of former Baltimore mayors. Her father, Thomas D'Alesandro, Jr., served as mayor of Baltimore for 12 years after representing the city for five terms in Congress. Her brother, Thomas D'Alesandro III, also served as mayor. If Pelosi, 72, hadn't sought the Democratic leadership post again, it probably would have gone to either Rep. Steny Hoyer of Maryland or Rep. James Clyburn of South Carolina. She said she didn't want to lose her place at the negotiating table with Obama, Vice President Joe Biden and Boehner. She said 'he thought of four men at that table' wouldn't exactly square with her longtime goal to 'empower women in the workplace.'

Britain will call for a new United Nations Security Council resolution to remove Syria's president Bashar al-Assad using the rules that led to wars in Libya and Iraq. Foreign Secretary William Hague announced yesterday that the UK wants to introduce a motion under Chapter VII of the UN Charter, which can approve the use of force. British diplomats say they will only threaten sanctions, rather than military action. But the move will be seen as a ratcheting up of pressure on both the Syrian regime and Russia, which has given Assad diplomatic protection. Calling for action: Foreign Secretary William . Hague, left, has announced that the UK wants to introduce a motion under . the UN Charter that could sanction the use of force to remove Syria's . President Assad, right . Putting the pressure on: The motion announced by British Foreign Minister William Hague, pictured left speaking with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, would put more pressure on Russia . The resolution likely to be introduced next week by Britain and France will be aimed at introducing international sanctions, an arms embargo and worldwide travel bans unless the regime in Syria implements a peace plan drawn up by former UN secretary general Kofi Annan. Up to 100 people are still being slaughtered each day in Syria as the Assad regime hits back against opposition forces, who have ended the dictator's dominance in key parts of the country. Mr Hague said yesterday: 'Countries like the United Kingdom will be seeking a Chapter VII resolution at the UN Security Council to mandate the implementation of the Annan plan, and threaten consequences for those who do not implement it.' At a meeting in Geneva at the weekend, Russia and China finally signed up to a plan for a transition of power that would lead to a government of national unity, containing elements of the current regime and its opposition. Russia insists that the deal did not sanction a wholesale regime change – but Britain is adamant that under the agreed terms, Assad would have to go. Ongoing conflict: 100 people are being killed in Syria each day as the Assad regime attempts to crack down on opposition forces . Constant danger: An unexploded mortar shell, from clashes between Syrian rebel fighters and government forces, is seen near Wadi Al-Sayeh district in Homs . Violent clashes: A man inspects a burning shop on a road covered in debris in the al-Khalidya district in Homs yesterday . Mr Hague said: 'What was in the communique was that a transitional government in Syria should include members of the present government and the opposition and other groups, and be formed on the basis of mutual consent, mutual assent, which means that each side can veto, if they wish, the people from the other side, who would be in a government. 'Of course, that would mean that President Assad could not be part of such a government.' He added that while sanctions are all that is being sought currently by the UK, military action could follow. 'I don't think we should rule anything out for the future,' he said. 'This is a rapidly deteriorating situation in which many thousands of people have now died, terrible torture is being committed.' Mass graves: Residents bury the bodies of people killed by shelling in Douma near Damascus . Devastation: Damaged buildings in Juret al-Shayah in Homs . Escaping the fighting: Wounded people had to make do with beds on the floor at a makeshift hospital in the Syrian city of Homs . A senior British diplomat said: 'We'll be looking pretty soon to make an assessment of when to move in the council, which I suspect will be pretty quickly. I expect it will be pretty ambitious. 'We want it to be a strong text with clear measures in there to increase the pressure on the regime to respect their obligations. Something which puts the Annan plan and the Geneva plan under Chapter VII and international law would be a very good thing. 'There is much that you can do under Chapter VII Article 41, which specifically rules out the use of force, but which allows coercive non-military measures such as economic sanctions, travel bans and that sort of thing.' Mr Annan is expected to travel to Damascus to demand cooperation from the regime to a transition of power.","Foreign secretary William Hague calls for motion under UN Charter that can sanction the use of force to remove Syria's President Assad .

And so it came to pass that Martha Levinson and Dowager Countess Violet finally came face to face at Downton Abbey. As Lady Mary and Matthew Crawley’s wedding loomed, the long-awaited encounters of the two grande dames did not disappoint. Across the dinner table or in a church pew, they were like a pair of grizzled gunslingers, trading acid quips instead of bullets. Not so painful perhaps, but almost as deadly. ‘Oh dear,’ cried Martha, pouncing on Maggie Smith’s Violet in the hallway and gleefully eyeing up her wrinkles. ‘The war has made old women of us both.’ Making an entrance: Shirley Maclaine as Martha Levinson in the third series of Downton Abbey, set in 1920 . ‘Oh no,’ Violet begged to differ. ‘I stay out of the sun.’ In the delirious new series of Downton Abbey, which began last night, Martha (Shirley MacLaine) came crunching down the drive at last. She was wearing jazz shoes, what appeared to be a fur papoose and a frozen expression on her face. We’d better get to like it — it’s the only one she’s got. As Lady Grantham’s American mother, Martha’s job is to patronise the English and their stuffy ways at every opportooonity. Hey, someone has to show these squares that the egalitarian delights of the New World, with its lack of pretence and stifling tradition, are the way forward. ‘Tradition!’ she sneers regularly, in the finest showbiz tradition. She insists upon boiled water and goat’s milk at all times, but I must say Shirley’s little dolly face seems slightly out of place amid the lush velvets and sprinkling of aristocratic Downton dust. Did they even have Botox and crafty pearly highlighter in them days? Shirl also seems to be acting to a different beat, but maybe she gets her stage directions on a time loop straight from Cecil B. DeMille himself? Who can say, but she is certainly a delicious target for Violet to be horrid about. Aid: Alfred, played by Matt Milne, is seen helping Martha out of a vehicle in the sumptuous setting . ‘When I am with her, I am reminded of the virtues of the English,’ she said. But Martha isn’t English, someone protested. ‘Quite,’ replied Violet, who later added that Martha is ‘like a homing pigeon, she finds our underbelly every time’. Is that what homing pigeons do? She was wearing jazz shoes, what appeared . to be a fur papoose and a frozen expression on her face. We’d better . get to like it — it’s the only one she’s got . Meanwhile, hang onto your inheritance, kids, for there is trouble looming. We know the Wall Street Crash is just a few years away, but Lord Grantham’s in the soup already. He had to go up to London on the 2.30 train to see Somebody In An Office Wearing A Fobwatch. This can only mean one thing. You see, the dopey Earl invested all of his wife’s money in something called the Canadian Grand Trunk Line — and it has only gorn off the rails! ‘Are you really telling me all the money has gone? The lion’s share of Cora’s fortune?’ he shouted, as Fobwatch nodded sadly. Inspecting her surroundings: Martha looks around as the the much-loved Downton characters return . ‘I refuse to be the failure, the Earl who dropped the torch and let the flame go out. I have a duty beyond saving my own skin,’ he said, munching through the freshly steamed script like a hungry termite. You know, I’m beginning to think that . Cora might be a little mad. It’s not just that simpering smile. Maybe . that slip on a bar of soap in series one damaged more than we ever knew? Back at Downton, when he told Cora the bad news, she admonished the silly sausage as if he had merely lost one of his socks, not her hard-inherited millions. You know, I’m beginning to think that Cora might be a little mad. It’s not just that simpering smile. Maybe that slip on a bar of soap in series one damaged more than we ever knew? Still, the money might have gone but, amazingly, by some kind of well-I-never dramatic osmosis, the earl-in-waiting was thinking of downsizing anyway. It's a pleasure: Martha (l) with Jessica Brown Findlay as Lady Sybil (c) and Michelle Dockery as Lady Mary (r) ‘To be honest,’ Matthew told his valet, ‘I want to live more simply after the wedding.’ That’s lucky! You know, sometimes the Doctor Who plots are more realistic than the Downton ones, but no one really cares. It is all part of the joy. And speaking of lost luggage, here comes . poor Edith; the plain one, the sister without a mister. Is she forever . doomed to wander from drawing room to dining room being bright and . brittle and single? And that’s not the only change with Matthew. Why has the pale-eyed Downton dish started wearing too many clothes? He is always trundling around in layers and layers of hats, coats, jackets, waistcoats ties, macs, and what have you. He is beginning to look like a packed suitcase. And speaking of lost luggage, here comes poor Edith; the plain one, the sister without a mister. Is she forever doomed to wander from drawing room to dining room being bright and brittle and single? She has set her jaunty cap at family friend Sir Anthony Strallan, who appears to dance at the other end of the ballroom, if that knowing look at Thomas the evil footman was anything to go by. Still, it’s not as if anyone was rubbing her face in it. Fellow stars: Martha with actress Maggie Smith, who plays Violet, Dowager Countess of Grantham . ‘Weddings can be reminders of one’s loneliness,’ Sir Anthony told her, while Grandma Martha asked her tartly: ‘Still no one special?’ Yes, hurrah. Branson the furiously Fenian . chauffeur is back and already in a pickle. Inside his appropriately . downtrodden Oirish tweeds, he bristles like a very angry hedgehog . It could have been worse!

One in three businesses is losing money and the road to Britain's economic recovery will be 'long and winding', the Bank of England warned yesterday. Experts dubbed these firms 'zombie businesses' which have survived only because interest rates are at an historic low and the banks are reluctant to pull the plug on them. It raises fears of large-scale job losses if the base rate of 0.5 per cent is raised, a move which would tip many firms over the edge. The big squeeze: How the Consumer Prices Index rate of inflation compares to year-on-year rises in pay, according to the Office for National Statistics . The Bank's Inflation Report published yesterday said the latest estimate is that 30.6 per cent of firms are losing money, a number which has increased sharply in recent years. The report warned the current situation 'may have allowed  businesses that will face lower demand in the longer term to continue trading'. Sir Mervyn King, the Bank's governor, painted a bleak picture of the future, offering little hope for an improvement in Britain's anaemic economic recovery. Nearly . 30million people aged 16 and over are in work – but almost half of the . new jobs created in recent months were part-time, official figures . revealed yesterday. The part-time boom has seen many . workers forced to accept such work despite desperately needing the . higher salary that comes with a full-time job. Between July and September, the . number in work jumped by 100,000 to 29.58million, equal to more than . 1,000 new jobs every day, the Office for National Statistics said. But of the 100,000 increase in employment, only 51,000 were full-time jobs and 49,000 were part-time. The ONS said 8.1million people, close to an all-time record, are working part-time. Of these, 1.4million say it is only because they ‘could not find a full-time job.’ Overall, the ONS said unemployment has dropped again, down 49,000 between July and September to 2.51million. Long-term unemployment is a . ballooning problem. Nearly half of those aged 50 and over have been . unemployed for more than 12 months. He said people should not be optimistic after the latest official figures from the Office for National Statistics revealed economic growth of 1 per cent between July and September. The figure is 'not a reliable guide to . the future', warned Sir Mervyn. He said: 'Continuing the recent zig-zag . pattern, output growth is likely to fall back sharply in the fourth . quarter as the boost from the Olympics in the summer is reversed – . indeed, output may shrink a little this quarter.' The report said Britain should brace itself for 'a period of persistently low growth'. Sir . Mervyn, who retires next year, added: 'We have decided the chances of a . rapid recovery are a good deal less than we thought.' He said economic growth is 'more . likely to be below than above its historical average rate over the . entire forecast period' – which is the next three years. The Bank's report reveals the number of firms which are collapsing is much lower than in the last recession in the early 1990s. Around . 55 companies every day are being plunged into insolvency, according to . the financial information firm Experian. But the Bank said the number of . loss-making firms is high, amid warnings from experts that a third of . 'zombie businesses' are at risk if they do not urgently get help to . solve  their problems. A . 'zombie' company can pay the interest on its debts but not repay the . debt itself, leaving it particularly vulnerable to a rise in borrowing . costs or a loss of business. Warning: Mervyn King, Governor of the Bank of England, has predicted the economy could be shrinking again due to a 'zig-zag' recovery . Christine . Elliott, chief executive of the Institute for Turnaround, which . represents experts who specialise in rescuing businesses, said: 'If they . are not given the tough, loving care that they need, they are . definitely at risk. 'The worrying thing about the situation is that there are jobs at risk. These businesses employ people whose livelihood depends on their job.' Employment minister Mark Hoban said the fall in youth unemployment was particularly welcome . Jon Moulton, chairman of investment . firm Better Capital, said the fact that businesses are being kept . artificially alive is a problem. He . told the BBC that in previous recessions they would have been 'tossed . into the bonfire and something better emerges', but 'the Darwin system' is not happening. 'About 10 . per cent of the private sector workforce are working in companies which . should have been sorted out,' Mr Moulton said. 'That is one of the reasons the economy is not recovering quickly. We need failure as part of the solution.' According to R3, the industry group . that represents insolvency practitioners, there are as many  as 146,000 . zombie businesses in  the UK. Despite the weak state of the economy, the Bank's report said that employment in the private sector remains 'puzzlingly robust'. At present, 23.9million people work in . the private sector, the largest number since records began, although . many are having to work part-time unwillingly. David . Kern, chief economist at the British Chambers of Commerce, said the . report paints 'a grim but realistic outlook for the UK economy'. Unemployment fell by 49,000 in the three months to September, but is still much higher than three years ago . Supermarket giant Tesco received a staggering 8,000 applicants for 400 jobs at a brand new store opening later this month. It means 20 people were chasing every single job at the new branch. The new store is opening in Woolwich, . South East London, which is an area renowned for its high levels of . unemployment. Greenwich Council says that 65 per cent of jobs have gone . to people from the Woolwich area. Council leader Chris Roberts said: . 'The amount of applications does show that we do need more jobs in the . area, which is why we are keen to promote regeneration schemes.' The shopworkers' trade union, USDAW, . says the huge flood of job requests is a sign of high unemployment . rates. But it said competition is often fierce among candidates for . Tesco jobs as pay rates are better than at other supermarkets. The USDAW spokesman said : 'The sort . of response a store gets to its job adverts depends on the level of . unemployment in the area. 'This is probably a sign of the . times, but also probably a sign of the remuneration package and other . benefits they offer. They are one of the best payers in the supermarket . sector.' Among the new recruits at the . Woolwich store is a former bus driver who struggled to find work after . he left his job of 20 years on the death of his wife. A single mother struggling to support her young daughter has also been recruited. The company set up a special training scheme for men and women who applied and had been out of work for more than six months. The scheme, run in cooperation with Greenwich Council, saw the last 92 trainees complete their course this week. Tesco's corporate affairs manager Matthew Magee said : 'This is the kind of response we get when we open a new store. 'There are great opportunities for people. In the last few store openings, we have had huge numbers of applications. 'All our pay rates are over the minimum wage and we are the leading payer in the industry.'","Olympic boost fades as households continue to see their incomes squeezed .

Led by Associate Professor Deli Chen (PhD 1996) from the Melbourne School of Land and Environment, the team is the first in Australia to accurately measure livestock emissions using laser and infrared spectroscopy systems. Results show the average methane emission is much lower than estimates currently used in Australia, but the average ammonia emission is substantially higher.Chen says ‘you can only find ways to reduce greenhouse gases if you can reliably measure them’. By sending a beam of light through the air, scientists can measure concentrations of methane, nitrous oxide and ammonia in the atmosphere. The beams are bounced back from a reflector and the particles in that area detected. Emissions are then calculated using a computer model to work out the origin of particles in the air.The work has spurred new research into the use of inhibitors that can be applied to manure and soil to reduce emissions. Preliminary results indicate emissions can be reduced by up to 80 per cent and the efficiency of nitrogen fertilisers significantly improved.

'De Hortus Sanitatis': A rare book detailing some of the earliest European medical texts has gone on display at the University of Aberdeen . A rare medieval book gives an insight into the bizarre medical practices used 500 years ago. It has gone on display for the first time at the University of Aberdeen. The De Hortus Sanitatis, which translates as the Garden of Health, shows some of the medical methods practiced in Scotland five centuries ago and is one of the earliest European medical texts. The book, first printed in Mainz, Germany, in 1491, is a fusion of late medieval science and folklore. It contains detailed writings and annotated illustrations on plants, herbs, animals, and minerals. Meanwhile, detailed illustrations reveal how physicians used to study the colour of urine to make diagnoses. It was once owned by George Peacock, an Aberdeen apothecary who in the early 1600s taught at the then newly-established Marischal College - one of the two founding colleges which merged to become the University of Aberdeen in 1860. Siobhan Convery, head of Special Collections at the University of Aberdeen, said: 'Hortus was the most popular and influential herbals of its time, and served as an encyclopedia of all knowledge and folklore on plants, animals, and minerals. 'It combines elements of natural history with subjects traditionally found in herbals, accompanied by mythical fantasies and fables. 'There are striking depictions of contemporary medical practice, the making of drug compounds, treatment for the removal of head lice etcetera, as well as the settings for much of this, a surgery and an apothecary’s shop. 'One image shows a woman removing head lice from a young boy. 'Another shows a boy removing honey from a comb. In the medieval period honey was used in a wide variety of ways, to cure coughs, as a diuretic, as a cure for some poisons and even as an application to rid hair of lice. A woman removes lice from a boys hair with a brush (left) while physicians analyse the colour of urine samples to diagnose ailments in an apothecary's shop (right) A hand coloured illustration of the Iris flower with an annotation by owner George Peacock . 'A lively scene from an apothecary’s shop shows physicians analysing the colour of urine samples to diagnose ailments. Urine charts and astrological charts were used side-by-side by physicians to diagnose diseases and to determine treatment.' The book is part of a new exhibition, Pharmacopoeia, meaning 'preparation of drugs', which includes some of the earliest recorded interpretations of the natural sciences. Items on display demonstrate the history of pharmacy and medical chemistry from its roots in a monastic setting through to modern chemical isolation and synthesis. Another 'very rare' compendium written in Middle English in the early 15th century includes  herb and plant based remedies for a range of minor and major ailments, from bad breath, nose bleeds and snake bites to broken limbs, childbirth and tumours. It reads: 'Here men may see the uses . of diverse herbs, which may be hot and may be cold, and how many things . they can be used for.' Ms Convery said: 'It was an easy-to-use reference book. A boy removes honey from the comb and makes a mess of his face in the process . Physicians consulting a series of patients in a sick room . A woodcut illustration of a group of intellects deep in discussion on a medical or botanical matter . 'It lists fennel leaf which is said to be good for headaches and also that ""to do away with aching and swelling in the womb"" the patient should ""drink dried fennel leaf"". 'More soberly, and reflecting the high infant and maternal death in childbirth there are numerous references to concoctions and recipes to ease labour pains, to accelerate deliveries and to assist with childbirth situations. 'For example on this page, ""if the child be dead in the mother’s womb take mugwort and stamp it small and plaster it to the mother’s womb until all cold and she will have delivery"". 'Following on from that is the use of hemlock as a cure for insomnia: ""hemlock will make a man sleep. Soak the herb in water and apply it to the temples and forehead and after bathe his feet in it, as hot as he may suffer it. Then make a plaster of henbane seed and apply it to his temples""'. Many of the detailed drawings provide an insight into the relationship between humans and animals at the time . The exhibition also highlights the work of the early plant collectors such as Professor James Trail, who made a substantial contribution to the Aberdeen University Herbarium and the Cruickshank Botanic Gardens. As well as tracing the history of the use of plants in medicine, the exhibition explores how plants are still being used to find new drugs, even if there is no historical use of the plant to treat disease. Ms Convery added: 'Scientists at the University of Aberdeen are engaged in the search for new treatments for infection, inflammation, parasitic diseases and cancer using nature’s bounty. 'More recently they have turned to investigating microorganisms from extreme environments such as the Mariana trench, the deepest place on earth, the Atacama desert, the driest place on earth and the Dead Sea. 'Cultivating bacteria and fungi from these environments has led to the discovery of unique compounds by Aberdeen scientists which may form the basis of future treatments.' The exhibition runs until December 1.","Encyclopedia of knowledge and folklore on plants, animals and minerals .

The future's orange: 'Wild' Bill Hickok shows off his Colt 1911 and announces his plans for the defenceless vegetable . Good aim: First Hickok fires several bullets into the centre of the pumpkin to create a nose . Scarily accurate: Next the father shoots two eyes into the pumpkin's vulnerable flesh . Speak no evil: The last stage is creating a wonky mouth-shape to complete the traditional Halloween decoration in a very non-traditional manner . First he blasts out two eyeholes, then a nose and then a crooked mouth, which looks as though it has one rotting tooth. The popular video has now been viewed by almost 200,000 people on his YouTube channel. It shows Hickok balancing a pumpkin on a tree stump, saying: 'Hey, Hickok 45 here, at the Hickok . compound. 'It's pumpkin carving time again and like last year we're . going to use another common household tool, the Colt 1911. Let's get at it.' Looking a fright: The brightly coloured squash looks battered but certainly has more character . Don't try this at home: Hickok shows the viewer the face that his 'carving' method has left in the back of the vegetable . He then aims his gun at the gourd, exclaiming 'All right!' and 'Nice. The right tool for the job.' The Colt 1911, also known as the M1911, was designed by John Browning in 1911 and is still widely used today. It was a standard-issue firearm for U.S. armed forces from its origination until 1985, and is still used by the military in as many as 28 countries. The single-action, semi-automatic pistol is popular for its stopping power, reliability, durability, accuracy and feel. It is considered very collectible. His final verdict? 'Handsome, looks a bit like me.' Then he turns it around, adding: 'There's a face on the back! Look at that. How'd that happen? 'Oh well. happy Halloween.' Hickok has something of a history when it comes to attacking the simple squash, having made several other videos that he claims provide 'an education that should be taught in school'. In 'Pumpkin Killing Methods III', he is seen stamping, sawing, slicing, crushing and shredding them. He uses hammers, breeze blocks, machine guns and even runs one over with a motorbike. His techniques are unlikely to appear at a children's carving session any time soon.

All 32 doors have been cast in gold and . an Islamic scholar was brought in to ensure that the Koran passages that . decorate the 16th century Taj Mahal are reproduced exactly. Three different types of stones were used to decorate the Taj Mahal: semi-precious stones such as onyx, jade and bloody stone; rare and scarce stones such as goldstone and magnet stone, and common stones such as sandstone and black slate. As soon as one enters one can see the central . chamber of the building beneath the main dome held the cenotaph of the . queen. Four octagonal rooms on each story flank the four rooms. Altogether 16 rooms (eight on each level) surround the central . chamber. These rooms were to be used to bury other members of the royal . family. Like the exterior the interior too is a building faced with white marble . but with much elaborated carvings and decoration.

'I also sent every workman to see the Taj Mahal personally so they could understand it.' Mr Hanif said he hopes to sell the Taj 2012 at auction when it is completed by the end of this year. The replica measures 3.5ft tall and 5.5ft across. Its specially made wooden stand alone is worth a million rupees - or £11,000.

Zuckerberg was blunt in responding: ‘Well it doesn’t help.’ The . hardest-hit by the dropping share price -which . initially launched at $38-per-share in May and now stands at a paltry . $19.48 - are employees who are . paid partially in stock, but the 28-year-old multi-billionaire said that . the company takes the lackluster stock price into consideration when . doling it out for salary. ‘We haven’t really done anything on equity to incentivise people,’ he said. ‘The . way that we do compensation is we translate the amount of cash we give . you into shares so if the shares are undervalued’ they give employees . more stock to equate to the amount they feel is fair. ‘We're going to do the things we think will build value over the long run,’ Zuckerberg explained while justifying the decision to go public. ‘We are a mission-driven company’ which he said tends to look to their larger goal of making the world more open and transparent, but like any business, ‘you can’t just focus on that.’ The sit down: Tech Crunch founder Michael Arrington, who has been critical of Facebook in the past, interviewed Zuckerberg for about 30 minutes on Tuesday afternoon . ‘The best people want to work on a mission they believe in but they also want to make a lot of money. ‘In order to do that we need to have a business model that makes a lot of money.’ ‘Building a mission and building a business goes hand in hand… the primary thing that makes me excited is about the mission.’ The decision to appear for the interview . was a clear effort by Zuckerberg to open up and re-energize the company . in hopes of stemming the exodus of key employees. Over the course of the summer, five . department heads all left the company, but today Zuckerberg said that he . feels now is the time to 'double down'. Focus on phones: While he said that he 'does everything' on his phone, he repeated past denials that the company is developing a phone of their own . 'I actually think that its a great time for people to stay,' he said, which was met with moderate applause. The appearance may have worked as well, with some analysts predicting that the talk helped increase Facebook's market capital by $1.7billion during the half-hour talk. The Facebook stock went up two per cent during after-hours trading, showing a positive response from the business world about the CEO's talk. Zuckerberg explained that he takes a inherently cautious approach when it comes to his evaluation of the company's public image. 'When people are writing nice stuff about us, it's important to get in front of the company and say, ""Don't believe all this."" When they write negative stuff, it's important to get in front of the company and say, ""Don't believe all this."" 'We are very self-critical too.' One of the mistakes that Zuckerberg pointed out was that they spent too long focusing on their HTML platform for the web as opposed to adapting and improving the product for mobile devices which he now firmly believes is the future of the network. He said that they underestimated 'how fundamentally good mobile is' for their growth. From a numbers perspective, he said a focus on mobile phones makes sense simply because they will have so many more prospective users as more people have phones than computers. That shift also makes financial sense for advertisers as engagement levels are higher on phones as well. 'I basically live on my mobile device,' Zuckerberg said. 'You know the founders letter in the S-1? I wrote that on my phone. I do everything on my phone.' Having fun: Zuckerberg admitted that his job is now more about achieving the mission of creating a more open web and while he did say he still had fun, his focus is more on building 'good stuff' Mr Arrington admitted that he has floated the theory that Facebook is developing their own physical phone for years- imagining a world where a group of engineers have been hidden away to create the new device- but Zuckerberg echoed his past denials repeatedly during the talk. He explained that it is better for Facebook to be available on all different mobile networks so that they can reach the most users no matter what type of phone they have, rather than spending time, money and energy developing their own product that would only get '10 million, 20 million people to use it. That doesn't move the needle for us!' 'Do you believe me yet? It's always been such a juicy story, but it's so clearly the wrong strategy for us,' he affirmed. In that same vein, Zuckerberg said that the company is actively developing their new Facebook app for Android but was non-committal when discussing a launch date, saying only that 'it will be ready when it's ready'. Another area that he confirmed is under improvement is the network's search function because he feels there is a depth of untapped potential for the tool since it typically just used to find people. 'We do on the order of a billion queries a day, and we're basically not even trying,' he said. Moving forward: He listed the Android app and improved search capabilities as two areas that the company is currently working on . What he said the company is interested in looking at are the way that Facebook can use the information about the user's friends and experiences to tailor the search. He gave the example of how can Facebook help a user find what sushi places their friends have been to in New York? Or what friends work at a particular company where the user wants to apply for a job? 'Facebook is uniquely positioned to give you answers,' he said. He gave nods to tech start ups like vacation home rental Airbnb, Spotify, and Instagram. Considering Zuckerberg was the one behind Facebook's $1billion acquisition of the photo-sharing service, it comes as little surprise that he said they were 'killing it'. While he remained upbeat and focused on the company's positive future in light of the discouraging stock market launch, he pointedly deflected to his dedication to the company's mission when asked if he was still having fun. 'For me it's not really about fun. It's about mission. It goes through waves. There are times when everyone thinks what we're doing is awesome. There are times when everyone is pessimistic. I would rather be in the cycle where people underestimate us. I would rather be underestimated. It gives us freedom to go out and do interesting stuff,' he said. 'When you look back 10 or 20 years from now, the legacy of this company should be that we've connected everyone in the world and they can share what they want.'","Mark Zuckerberg gave first interview since company went public .

Wendy Bowley, 44, wrapped six-month-old pooch Rory in a blood-stained sheet and told vets she had just rescued him. The border terrier, named Rory, was so ill with mange - a skin condition caused by a parasitic mite - he lost virtually all his fur and was bleeding from numerous open sores. Cruel: Wendy Bowley, of Redhill, Hereford, subjected her puppy to appalling abuse, then tried to pretend he was a stray so she would not have to pay the vet's bill, the court heard .

Laurels Veterinary Surgery in Hereford 11 days later, where she again . claimed he was a stray she had found in the garden. Chris Reed, defending, said Bowley was 'in an incredibly difficult position' because she simply could not afford the bill. He said: 'It’s not the case that Mrs Bowley ignored the situation. 'Clearly the dog was suffering, but . Wendy Bowley wasn’t simply being cruel. She tried her best to deal with a . situation to the best of her ability.'

A baby boy has become Britain's youngest ever burglary victim - after his own uncle stole £110 from the newborn to buy drugs. Sam Harlow, 20, climbed through a window at his sister's house to swipe the cash belonging to her then 10-day-old baby son, which was kept in an envelope marked 'Alfie's Money'. Alfie's mother Gemma Harlow - who had been planning to set up a savings account for her little boy - branded her brother 'despicable' as he was given an eight-month suspended jail sentence for the pre-planned burglary. Victim: Gemma Harlow kept cash given as gifts to her baby son following his birth in an envelope marked 'Alfie's Money', which was stolen by the little boy's uncle, Sam Harlow . Harlow, of Exmouth, Devon, had spotted the envelope of cash while visiting his sister's house earlier on the same day, and unlocked a window so he could sneak back in and snatch it in the middle of the night. He admitted burglary, theft and possession of cannabis at Exeter Crown Court where he was given an eight month suspended jail sentence and ordered to undertake drug rehabilitation and 150 hours of unpaid work. The court heard Harlow - who has been disowned by his family - had used baby Alfie's money to buy drugs. Speaking after the verdict, his . sister Gemma, Alfie's mother, said: 'I don't know how anyone can steal . from a baby. It is despicable and about as low as you can get.' The 24-year-old told how her brother had come to her house on the day of the theft to drop off a prescription for her mother. 'During that time he unlocked the window by the front door,' she said. 'That is how he got back in later. He broke back in while we were still upstairs and I was in the process of feeding Alfie.' Miss Harlow said the money had been given to Alfie in congratulations cards she was sent after giving birth. 'Most of it was given by my partner's grandparents and was to be used to start a savings account. 'My brother knew it was for Alfie and was not ours as it was in a special envelope,' she said.

'You had been at the house earlier at the same time you saw this money which had been given to the new born baby Alfie. You went away and came back in the middle of the night.

And, for one jilted wife, if a few bugs and grubs are thrown in, all the better. For Rachael Butler – whose  husband had an affair with Nadine Dorries – has revealed how she has voted ‘hundreds of times’ for the Tory MP to take part in I’m A Celebrity’s gruesome bushtucker trials. Hard to stomach: Nadine Dorries, 55, who was suspended from the Conservative Party when she went on ITV show I’m A Celebrity Get Me Out Of Here, has been repeatedly voted to undergo sickening Bushtucker Trials . Yuck: Coronation Street actress Helen Flanagan (left) takes on Nadine Dorries (right) in a Bushtucker trial as Ant and Dec (back right) watch on during an episode of ITV's I'm A Celebrity Get Me Out Of Here . The 56-year-old mother of two has even put Miss Dorries’s hotline number into her speed dial to save crucial seconds when she is voting against her on the ITV reality. The 55-year-old politician has already had to face two gruelling ordeals, in which she was forced to eat a camel’s toe and a lamb’s testicle, and locked inside a wooden coffin filled with maggots, crickets and cockroaches. And there could be bigger trials to come – she has been suspended from the Conservative Party and faces questions upon her return about her reasons for abandoning her post for up to four weeks on full pay. Mrs Butler, who was married to husband John for 30 years before their split last year, said: ‘I voted for her to do the trial thing. Dislike: Rachael Butler (right) revealed she is helping Nadine Dorries MP (left) munch on the likes of baked spider, camel toe and other animal parts - by having the phone number to nominate her for trials on speed dial .

I must have voted  for her hundreds of times. It’s worth the money. ‘The public seem to be picking on her and I’m like, “Carry on, keep on picking on Dorries, she deserves everything she gets”.’ Mrs Butler first met Miss Dorries, then married to her ex-husband Paul, from whom she split in 2006, in the late 1990s when they became neighbours in Chipping Campden, Gloucestershire. Their daughters attended the same school, and the couples used to meet regularly for dinner, even going on holiday together to St Lucia in 2000. Together: Rachael Butler (left), 56, of Chipping Campden, Gloucestershire, hit the headlines in January 2011 when Nadine Dorries (right) - her friend of 13 years - admitted having a fling with her husband John . Scary: Nadine Dorris (in a 'bug burial' Bushtucker Trial) has drawn criticism for swapping her parliamentary duties for the Australian jungle, but pledged to donate her MP's salary during her time on the show to charity . But last year the friendship ended after it emerged the MP had started a relationship with Mr Butler. Mrs Butler said at the time she became suspicious of her husband ‘when he started to go to the pub a lot’. She added: ‘Before Christmas he was going out every night and he said he had to meet friends. ‘Some nights he just never came home. I kept saying to him, “Is there another woman?”. He would say, “No, no, no, there isn’t”. Foolishly I believed him. ‘My marriage hasn’t been in good shape for some years. It died a death some time ago. But this doesn’t excuse Nadine for what she did. ‘I just want everyone to know  that Nadine Dorries is not the saintly person she appears to be. Because she’s an MP, people think of her as a pillar of society but in fact she’s a marriage-wrecker.’ Miss Dorries and Mr Butler split in October last year after around nine months together. But Mrs Butler has refused to forget the hurt their relationship has caused. She said yesterday: ‘It did all die down and now she is in the public eye again. It’s a bit annoying. ‘She’s never been into that sort of thing, camping and roughing it. She likes creature comforts and luxury hotels. She is definitely doing it for the publicity and for the money. ‘She will probably need the money when she gets out because she might not have a job. I want her to stay in there, I don’t want her being voted off. Let’s keep her in the jungle.’","Nadine Dorries MP admitted fling with Rachael Butler's husband in 2011 .

Goalkeeper Owen Thompson, 14, who has Tourette's Syndrome, was sent off a football pitch for swearing at a referee . A 14-year-old footballer with Tourette's Syndrome was banned for two games after swearing at the referee. Goalkeeper Owen Thompson became frustrated after the official allowed a contentious goal which led to his football team losing to another. He disagreed with the referee’s decision and told him to 'f*** off'. Owen, who once had trials for Watford FC, was reported to his local FA and slapped with a two-game suspension and a £25 fine for foul and abusive language on the pitch. Football chiefs imposed the punishment despite the young footballer holding a medical card for Tourette’s, which makes him prone to sudden outbursts of obscene language. Owen’s condition is so severe he sometimes shouts 'chavs' at gangs of older men. Owen, from Stanstead Abbotts, Hertfordshire today said after the FA’s decision he is now considering quitting football. His mother Melanie Burgess, 37, said it was 'ridiculous' a teenager with Tourette’s had been banned for swearing. She said : 'After the game the referee went over to Owen’s manager. He showed the referee the medical card that shows Owen has Tourette’s syndrome. 'But last week we learnt he has been given a two-match ban and a £25 fine. It’s ridiculous. 'Football is a really important part of his life.' Ware Youth under-15s manager Alistair West said: 'You can’t ban a Tourette’s sufferer for swearing. 'I always show the other manager his card and tell the other parents. And every single parent and manager has been fantastic - we’ve not had one complaint. 'It’s frustrating because he’s a really good kid.' Owen, who was diagnosed with Tourette’s last year, refused to shake the referee's hand and the stress of the situation caused him to have an outburst during the match on October 7. He was playing for Ware Youth under-15s team, which ended up losing 2-1 to the Bengeo Tigers. Ware Youth secretary Sue Thomas said Owen, who has played for the club for six years, has an exemplary discipline record. The team appealed Owen’s ban and paid £10 to make a written representation, but Hertfordshire FA upheld the decision. Owen could make a second appeal, with a charge of £50, to have his case heard by the FA at Wembley. Hertfordshire FA chief executive Nick Perchard said: 'The player swore at the referee twice and then walked away and refused to talk to the referee when asked to explain his actions. 'After the match, the referee reported the incident to us and the player was charged with improper conduct. 'The committee took the player’s condition in to account and the one-match suspension imposed was in regards to the playing refusing to return to the field of play to discuss why he had sworn at the referee. 'The committee decided that the lack of respect shown to the match official was not connected to his medical condition. Owen pictured with his mother Melanie Burgess, who said it was 'ridiculous' her son had been banned after swearing . 'This has been a highly unusual case, but Hertfordshire FA remains committed to helping as many players as possible enjoy the game regardless of ability or ongoing medical issues.' Hertfordshire FA has now reduced Owen’s punishment to a one-match ban and a £15 fine. Owen spent half a term off school last year with severe depression as he came to terms with his Tourette’s developing into swearing. Melanie, a special needs teaching assistant, said Owen’s condition is a 'real battle every day' and football was the only thing keeping him going. The mother-of-three said: 'I think a lot of TV programmes are ready to pick fun of Tourette’s sufferers. 'There’s another side to it - it’s not just about saying funny things out loud. 'I took him to a specialist because I thought he had a nervous twitch. It started out just blinking and screwing up his face but the tics have become verbal. 'Stress and feeling uncomfortable brings them on. He comes home from school exhausted from trying to suppress them. It’s a real battle every day. 'We’ve tried reducing additives and magnesium in his food, pro-biotics and medication. Just as we think he’s getting better all of a sudden this sets him back.' Owen said he was inspired to keep playing by Everton goalkeeper Tim Howard, who also has Tourette’s. He said: 'He is my inspiration. I look up to him.'

A 20-year-old soldier who was struggling to come to terms with the deaths of five comrades in an explosion in Afghanistan took his own life when he was on home leave, an inquest heard yesterday. Rifleman Allan Arnold was found hanged outside in his home town of Cirencester, Gloucestershire, with a note discovered on his body apologising to his mother and saying he could not cope anymore. But his mother and sister refused to believe it was his handwriting after the May 2011 death - saying he was dyslexic and his writing was very distinctive, Gloucester Coroner’s Court heard. Tragic: Rifleman Allan Arnold was found hanged outside in his home town of Cirencester, Gloucestershire, with a note was found on his body apologising to his mother and saying he could not cope anymore . He was serving with 2 Rifles based at Ballykinler barracks in Northern Ireland. It was the last day of his leave and he had spent the previous night drinking heavily with friends, the inquest was told. Gloucestershire Assistant Deputy Coroner Katy Skerrett ruled that despite the family’s doubts, Rifleman Arnold wrote the note - but she was not sure whether he intended to take his own life. His close friend Andy Higgins said that at the time of his death he had been ‘unable to cope’ with the loss of so many of his friends in Afghanistan after an improvised explosive device detonated. Shortly before his death, Rifleman Arnold had told a physiotherapist who was treating him for a shoulder injury that he was having trouble coming to terms with the deaths of the five friends. Corporal Jonathan Horne and Riflemen William Aldridge, James Backhouse, Joseph Murphy and Daniel Simpson were all killed in the roadside blast in Sangin, Afghanistan, in July 2009. The evening before he died, Rifleman Arnold had been out drinking with serving soldier and friend Michael Greenacre. They met by chance and then stayed together drinking into the early hours. Struggling: Shortly before his death, Rifleman Arnold (left and right) had told a physiotherapist who was treating him for a shoulder injury that he was having trouble coming to terms with the deaths of the five friends . ‘He was his normal self,’ Mr Greenacre said. ‘He was happy and chirpy. He seemed happy to be going back to his regiment. We were both semi-drunk by the early hours. After we got some food we went to Allan’s sister’s. Drugs were being taken there and I saw him take some.’ 'We hadn’t always got on, but he said he wanted to forget all that had happened. He went to all the people I was with and spoke to them. It was like he wanted to make peace with everyone' Jordan Baker, friend . They walked back to where he was staying at about 3am and Allan left about 15 minutes later to go back to his mother’s house, he said. ‘He said he would probably see me the next day before he left,’ Mr Greenacre added. Friend Jordan Baker spoke of how he had seen Allan the weekend before his death. He said: ‘We hadn’t always got on, but he said he wanted to forget all that had happened. He went to all the people I was with and spoke to them. It was like he wanted to make peace with everyone.’ Many of the young soldier’s comrades and officers gave evidence and most said he had not appeared any different in the weeks before his death. Conflict abroad: File picture of soldiers in Sangin, Afghanistan, where Rifleman Arnold lost five comrades . Killed: Corporal Rifleman William Aldridge (left) and Rifleman James Backhouse (right) both died in the blast . But his platoon commander Lieutenant James Amoore said the Rifleman had undergone treatment with the army mental health team following a previous tour in Afghanistan, which had been a particularly difficult time. ‘He was struggling to come to terms with it but this was not in any way unusual,’ he said. 'He was struggling to come to terms with it but this was not in any way unusual. He was coping as well as anyone in his position could be expected to cope' Lt James Amoore, platoon commander . ‘He was coping as well as anyone in his position could be expected to cope. He seemed happy when he stopped seeing the team and it was his choice to stop receiving help.’ He said Rifleman Arnold had suffered a shoulder injury not long before his death and if this had not healed he knew he would not be able to serve with his platoon when he went back to Afghanistan and would be given a job on one of the main bases. ‘This really knocked him because he would not be going out with the rest of his platoon,’ he said, adding that he had also recently failed a course for an intelligence role because of his dyslexia. Summing up, Coroner Skerrett said there were no suspicious circumstances surrounding the death and there were two possible verdicts she could record - suicide or an open verdict. Fallen comrade: Corporal Jonathan Horne was also one of five killed in the blast in Afghanistan in July 2009 . Dead: Riflemen Joseph Murphy (left) and Daniel Simpson (right) were also killed in the tragic roadside blast . ‘I have to be sure he intended to take his own life if I decide to record a verdict of suicide and to be able to rule out all other possible explanations,’ she said. He had been through a handwriting course while in the army and his handwriting had improved, she said, so she was satisfied the note had been written by him. 'He would have bent over backwards to give you the shirt off his back' Abigail Smith, sister . He was under the influence of alcohol and drugs and had experienced a very traumatic tour of duty in Afghanistan and this was still playing on his mind, Coroner Skerrett said. She added: ‘Failing the intelligence course would also have been a huge disappointment to him but against all this is the evidence that he was his usual happy self.’ Coroner Skerrett said the decision to hang himself could have been taken on the spur of the moment and she could not be sure he had a fixed intention to kill himself. She recorded an open verdict. After the inquest, his sister Abigail Smith said he was a man loved by all his friends and family. ‘He would have bent over backwards to give you the shirt off his back,’ she added.","Rifleman Allan Arnold found dead in 2011 in Cirencester, Gloucestershire .

He’s knocked his opponents senseless in the ring but Mike Tyson admitted defeat in a bear-knuckle confrontation with a koala in Brisbane, Australia. The former world heavyweight champion, 46, threw in the towel when he was given the chance of cuddling a koala called Tracy, declaring that she might just put the bite on him. That, he was anxious to make clear, was in no way meant as a reminder of his famous ear-bite of Evander Holyfield.

A supermarket manager committed suicide after the two families he had been hiding just ten miles apart for more than two decades discovered his secret double life. Andrew Ingham, 50, divided his time between 12 children by two ‘wives’ who lived within a 20-minutes drive of each other in Hertfordshire. But he committed suicide when Jacqueline, his legal spouse of 30 years, and his mistress Anita Barrett found out about each other, an inquest heard. He sank into depression when they both left him in December last year after and he was found dead in a tiny flat after being forced to move there three months later. Depressed: Andrew Ingham , pictured left with one of his daughters,  committed suicide when Jacqueline, his legal spouse of 30 years, and his mistress Anita Barrett (right) found out about each other . The wife's home (left) and the mistress's home: Mr Ingham's eldest children put together the two halves of his life using Facebook . His older children discovered his double life by piecing together clues they found on Facebook, and both women met in December. Remarkably, he fathered four children . with his mistress and eight children with his wife. Mr Ingham’s oldest . child with his wife is 27, while his youngest child is eight. During the hearing into his death at . Chelmsford Coroner’s Court, Mrs Ingham, 48, and Miss Barrett, 42, sat at . opposite ends of the courtroom. Mr Ingham married Jacqui, 48, in 1983. Together they bought a house in Welwyn Garden City, Herts, where she still lives. Eight years into his marriage he started a relationship with Ms Barrett in Hoddesdon, 10 miles, or 20 minutes' drive, away. The inquest heard that Mr Ingham committed suicide after feeling depressed about ‘events which had been going on in his personal life’. Before killing himself he left a number of suicide notes addressed ‘to whom it may concern’. Mr Ingham had been living alone in a flat above a restaurant in Waltham Abbey when his body was discovered by his friend Stuart Pryde. Mr Pryde, who owned and renovated the flat, became suspicious when he found a parking ticket on Mr Ingham’s car, saying that his friend always took care not to receive fines. After using his own key to let himself into the property, Mr Pryde discovered his friend. Mr Pryde told the court in a statement: ‘I took one step in the room. I saw several notes on the bed. I peered round the corner of the room and saw Andrew’s body hanging from the loft hatch. I just took a glimpse.’ He said that, shocked by the scene, he called the police immediately. Alone: Sun Street in Waltham Abbey, where Mr Ingham was living at the time of his death . Mr Pryde also told the court that he was aware of circumstances in his friend’s personal life. The inquest heard that Mr Ingham had not been seen for three days before his body was discovered. Coroner Caroline Beasley-Murray, who recorded a verdict that Mr Ingham killed himself, told the court that there were no suspicious circumstances surrounding the death but said there remained ‘unanswered questions’. The coroner said she bore in mind the note and believed Mr Ingham was suffering from depression. She said: ‘The court senses a great deal of grief, anger, anxiety, lots of questions, all sorts of emotions swirling around in this court room. This court cannot answer why. Very often there are lots of unanswered questions.’ Inspector Sarah Harding told the coroner she was ‘satisfied that he decided to take his life over the weekend’. After the inquest Ms Barrett said: 'He spent half and half of his time between us. He was just a very good liar.' She told The Sun: 'Both families know each other now. We all found out at the same time - the eldest kids used Facebook to put it all together.'

Indian authorities investigating a rape case say a sprinter who won a women's relay gold medal at the 2006 Asian Games is actually a man. Police charged Pinki Pramanik on Monday with raping and assaulting a woman she was living with in the eastern state of West Bengal. The woman alleged Pramanik was a man who had reneged on a promise to marry her. Gender row: Female Asian Games gold medallist Pinki Pramanik (pictured) has been charged with raping a woman after medical tests showed she was actually a man . Indian authorities said an eight-member medical board submitted a gender test along with the charge sheet that concluded Pramanik was genetically male. Pramanik has denied the charges, calling them a 'huge conspiracy'. She said that, contrary to the police claims, the medical report concluded that she was incapable of committing rape, New Delhi Television reported. Pramanik said that the medical board told her that she had 'symptoms of excess male hormones as after-effect of some of the drugs I had taken during my sports career.' 'Huge conspiracy': Police escort former Pramanik to the Barasat District court after her arrest on suspicion of rape in June . Caster Semenya, above, was dragged through a . humiliating gender row in 2009 when the women's 800m world champion was . accused of being a man. The governing body of world . athletics, the IAAF, asked South Africa to test their star's gender . after her muscular physique and extraordinary performances sparked . speculation over whether she was really female. Initial tests had showed she had high levels of testosterone. Semenya, then 18, was forced out of . competition for nearly a year and even went into hiding as rumours . surfaced that she was a hermaphrodite. She was finally cleared to compete and went on to win silver in the 800m at the 2011 world championships and London 2012. New guidelines were introduced for this year's Olympics after the handling of the affair by the IAAF was strongly criticised. The row bears some resemblance to the one . that surrounded woman's 800m world champion Caster Semenya, who was . forced out of competition for nearly a year after she was accused of . being man. Pramanik also said that she hadn't been given a copy of the medical report. The former middle-distance runner, who won the 4x400 m relay gold in 2006 Doha Asian Games, was arrested on June 14 after her partner's complaint. She was freed on bail in July after spending more than 20 days in jail. Pinki's earlier gender tests were inconclusive both at a private nursing home at Barasat and at the Barasat General Hospital. 'The case was referred to the . state-run SSKM hospital, but facility for chromosome pattern test was . unavailable there too. 'Later, the test was concluded in Hyderabad,' police said. The athlete's arrest and imprisonment . earlier sparked an outcry across the state over gender discrimination . and the manner in which the tests were conducted. The Calcutta High Court ordered a . probe into the alleged violation of Pinki's rights, while asking the . state government to file an affidavit against the allegations of rights . violation within two weeks. Besides her 4x400m relay gold at the . 2006 Doha Asian Games, Pinki also won a gold each at the 2005 Asian . Indoor Games in Pattaya and the 2006 South Asian Games in Colombo.

Birthday girl: With the Duchess of Cambridge set to turn 30 on 9 January, William is rumoured to be commissioning an oil portrait of his new wife to mark the occasion . With a party-planning socialite for a . sister and a brother-in-law as well-connected as Prince Harry, the . Duchess of Cambridge's 30th birthday was never going to be allowed to . pass without fanfare. Sure enough, when Kate enters her fourth decade on 9 January next week, Pippa and Harry will be on hand to ensure proceedings go off with a bang. According to Grazia magazine who names a 'royal source' as their mole, the fun-loving two have planned an Eighties-themed birthday party for Kate complete with cocktails and karaoke. The magazine revealed that Pippa and Harry have been organising a 'secretly arranged party' to be thrown in her honour this weekend. On the eve of her 30th, Kate is said to be making her movie premiere debut with William at Odeon Leicester Square for Stephen Spielberg's film War Horse. She and William are to attend a £10,000 a ticket charity dinner afterwards. After that, Kate and William will be free to party. Grazia's royal source said: 'In many ways, this is going to be Kate's last chance to let go like she did back in the old days when she and William first met. 'The party has been months in the planning. Pippa and Harry have been in the thick of it, and have recruited a bunch of friends to help. 'The guests have been sent ""save the date"" cards, and told that it will probably be in London. 'Given the people organising it, you can be sure it will be brilliant.' Grazia goes on to say that the party, which will have an 80s theme to mark the decade in which Kate was born - will be an intimate affair for 'close friends and family.' With David and Victoria now considered close pals of the two young royals, the guest list is likely to be stellar. Where the party is to be held is yet to be confirmed, though it is said to be a  secret 'pop-up' venue. The report suggests that cocktails will be organised by Charlie Gilkes and Duncan Sterling, friends of Kate and William who own Maggie's Bar and Bunga Bunga in Chelsea. Friends will no doubt be wondering what they could possibly buy the future Queen. Grazia's sources close to Kate have said she has asked guests to donate to charity in place of buying her gifts. For his part though, William is understood to be keen to mark the occasion with a thoughtful present, and has been looking to buy his new wife a watch. The young prince is also said to be commissioning an oil portrait of the Kate to celebrate her 30th birthday and her first year as a member of the royal family. Big bash: Kate's fun-loving sister Pippa and well-connected brother-in-law Prince Harry are said to have organised a secret Eighties-themed karaoke party for close friends and family . The Queen is said to be giving Kate a tiara from the royal collection. Grazia's royal source says the party will be a good way for Kate to let off steam ahead of what will be a tough year. Next month, William is to be posted to the Falklands for six weeks as part of his role as Royal Navy helicopter pilot. Privately, Kate is said to be 'dreading' his absence. 'It's going to be a party of clashes in every way, says the source. 'On the one hand there are all these exquisite royal trappings, and on the other, Pippa is planning to top off the party with a karaoke session. Kate needs to enjoy herself while she can, though, so she can be forgiven for belting out a few Duran Duran and Madonna numbers on her birthday. 'It's all going to get pretty serious soon afterwards. Kate's understandably nervous and is giong to miss William desperately.'","Party to be thrown at secret London location for 'close friends and family'

"By . Harriet Cooke and Martin Robinson . PUBLISHED: . 11:03 EST, 15 November 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 17:10 EST, 15 November 2012 . A woman who was desperate to find love has today warned of the dangers of internet dating after her lover slashed her beloved horse before plotting an attack on her. Nathalie Kelderman, 37, met Sebastiano Mauro, 43, on a dating site, but their passionate but ‘tempestuous’ affair ended when he flew into a rage after she said hello to another man. Mauro took revenge by creeping into the stables where Miss Kelderman kept her horse and cutting the animal’s hind leg to the bone. The Sicilian was arrested, but released on the condition he did not approach his ex. Early happiness: Nathalie Kelderman and Sebastiano Mauro met on . Match.com and enjoyed a passionate romance during the early months . of their relationship . Days later, police found him parked outside her home with a carving knife, two screwdrivers, scalpel blades, a tourniquet, latex gloves and two syringes containing his own blood. Mauro, a surgical nurse at a private hospital, was jailed for five years in April after a jury found him guilty of injuring a horse and going equipped for burglary intending to inflict grievous bodily harm. Miss Kelderman is now warning others about being sucked into dangerous relationships in the same way. 'Dating sites are great at telling you how they can help you find a lasting relationship or even marriage – but they don’t highlight the dangers,' she told the Mirror, adding: 'I was sucked into an abusive relationship because of internet dating.' Miss Kelderman signed up to Match.com after she broke up with her partner of eight years because she was struggling to meet new people in and around her home in St Albans, Hertfordshire. Victims: Nathalie Kelderman with her horse Jessie, who was cut to the bone by her lover Sebastiano Mauro . Macho: Sebastiano Mauro posted this moody picture on his Match.com dating profile . Mauro first contacted Miss Kelderman in December 2010, and days later, the pair met for lunch, sparking an 'instant connection'. Soon the couple were seeing each other every week, and Mauro spoiled his new girlfriend with gifts paid for by his earnings as the second medical officer of a cruise liner. But Miss Kelderman said Mauro became increasingly possessive, forcing her to restrict her time spent horse-riding or with friends. The turning point came in July last year when he lashed out at her for saying hello to a jogger. During a hearing at St Albans Court, the office worker said: ‘Sebastiano got upset. He said, “How dare you greet another man like that? How dare you humiliate me like that in public?” ‘He grabbed me by my arm, threw me on the floor and pinned me down, shaking me and shouting at me. Then he got up, kicked me and said, “You would make an excellent f****** w****”.’ On July 11, Mauro drove to the stables in Bricket Wood, Hertfordshire, where Miss Kelderman kept her horse, a ten-year-old bay called Jessie. A groom later found the horse bleeding heavily and a vet was called to stitch the wound. Medical officer: Sebastiano Mauro poses in uniform on his Match.com profile, which has now been removed . Mauro was arrested, but days after a crown court judge freed him, police spotted him parked near Miss Kelderman’s home, covered in blood with a bag containing a knife. He claimed he got blood on his clothes while taking samples for his job. He also said he was picking up personal items from Miss Kelderman. After realising he had reactivated his profile in September last year, Miss Kelderman twice warned Match.com about Mauro. But his profile had not been removed from the website a month after his trial in March this year. It was finally taken off the site in May after a reporter contacted the organisation. Miss Kelderman said: 'Men like Seb can use these sites to pick and choose from a list of potential future victims – it’s high time dating agencies met their responsibilities head on.' A spokesman for Match said: 'The safety of our members is important to us, and in light of his conviction, we can confirm Mr Mauro’s profile has been removed.” Sebastiano Mauro, 43, left, was found guilty of injuring a horse and going equipped for burglary intending to inflict grievous bodily harm.

"By . Toby Harnden . PUBLISHED: . 13:21 EST, 15 November 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 14:01 EST, 15 November 2012 . Governor Bobby Jindal of Louisiana, a former vice-presidential prospect in 2012 and potential 2016 Republican candidate has branded Mitt Romney as 'absolutely wrong' for saying he lost the election because of Barack Obama's 'gifts' to voters. 'I absolutely reject that notion,' Jindal said on a conference call with donors today. 'I don’t think that represents where we are as a party and where we’re going as a party. And that has got to be one of the most fundamental takeaways from this election.' The remarks will be seen as early jockeying for position among the 2016 Republican hopefuls. Outraged: Louisiana Republican governor Bobby Jindal said Mitt Romney was 'absolutely wrong' to say he lost the election because of Obama's 'gifts' to voters . Along with Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, Governor Chris Christie of New Jersey and Representative Paul Ryan, Romney's running mate, Jindal, 41, is seen as one of the new generation of Republicans who will vie for the White House in four years. Romney, speaking to his own campaign donors earlier in the day, said that Obama's 'very generous' healthcare reform and directive to allow some illegal immigrants to remain in the United States as 'highly motivational' to some voter groups. 'The president’s campaign focused on giving targeted groups a big gift - so he made a big effort on small things. Those small things, by the way, add up to trillions of dollars.' At a meeting of the Republican Governors Association (RGA), however, Jindal, who is Indian-American, criticised the Romney campaign for failing to present a 'vision' to Americans and argued that the Republican nominee's campaign allowed the election to become a 'contest between personalities'. 'We have got to stop dividing the American voters,' Jindal said, according to the Los Angeles Times. 'If we’re going to continue to be a . competitive party and win elections on the national stage, and continue . to fight for our conservative principles, we need two messages to get . out loudly and clearly. Sore loser? Romney said low-income voters, minorities and young people gave Obama a second term in the White House . 'One, we are fighting for 100 percent of the votes. And second, our policies benefit every American who wants to pursue the American Dream, period.' But in a conference call with his national finance committee, Romney said Obama's win was based on bribing loyal Democratic constituencies. The poor had been promised 'free health care', illegal immigrants that he had protected from deportation and college-aged women had been offered free contraceptives. 'You can imagine for somebody making $25,000 or $30,000 or $35,000 a year, being told you’re now going to get free health care, particularly if you don’t have it, getting free health care worth, what, $10,000 per family, in perpetuity? I mean, this is huge.' 'Likewise, with Hispanic voters, free health care was a big plus,' he added. 'But in addition with regards to Hispanic voters, the amnesty for children of illegals, the so-called DREAM Act kids, was a huge plus for that voting group.' Obama announced in June that he would grant temporary amnesty to some children of illegal immigrants who met certain requirements and had clean criminal records. The programme resembled the DREAM Act, which had long been stalled in Congress. This summer, Romney criticised Obama for waiting so long to deal with immigration reform, a 2008 election promise, lambasting that his 'amnesty' programme as politically motivated. 'He saves these sort of things until four-and-a-half months before the general election,' he told CBS. 'I think the timing is pretty clear. If he really wanted a solution that dealt with these kids or illegal immigration in America, then this is something he would have taken up in his first three-and-a-half years, not in his last few months.' Winner: Obama with his wife Michelle and daughters Malia and Sasha on Election Night in Chicago . According to exit polls, Romney secured 59 per cent of the white vote while Obama was backed by 93 per cent of black voters, 71 percent of Hispanics and 60 per cent of voters younger than 30, according to exit polls. On the conference call, Romney said that Obama directed his campaign according to the 'old playbook' of targeting specific groups with promises of legislation that would persuade them to vote a certain way. 'In each case they were very generous in what they gave to those groups. With regards to the young people, for instance, a forgiveness of college loan interest, was a big gift. 'Free contraceptives were very big with young college-aged women. And then, finally, Obamacare also made a difference for them, because as you know, anybody now 26 years of age and younger was now going to be part of their parents’ plan, and that was a big gift to young people. 'They turned out in large numbers, a larger share in this election even than in 2008,' he said. Paul Ryan, Romney's vice-presidential running mate, has blamed the Republican defeat on high turnout among urban voters. 'I think the surprise was some of the turnout, some of the turnout especially in urban areas, which gave President Obama the big margin to win this race,' he told a television station in Wisconsin. 'When we watched Virginia and Ohio coming in, and those ones coming in as tight as they were, and looking like we were going to lose them, that’s when it became clear we weren’t going to win.' Romney told his finance team that the sting of his loss was still too strong to begin mapping out his plans and the future of the party. 'I am very sorry that we didn’t win. I know that you expected to win. We expected to win… It was very close, but close doesn’t count in this business. 'And so now we're looking and saying, ""O.K., what can we do going forward?"" But frankly we’re still so troubled by the past, it’s hard to put together our plans from the future.' Representative Chris Van Hollen, a leading Democrat, told CNN that he agreed with Jindal 'that Governor Romney's remarks were way off base'. and served as a reminder of the controversial '47 per cent' video that was secretly taped at a private Florida fundraiser for Romney earlier this year. 'There are 47 per cent of the people who will vote for the president no matter what,' Romney said in the video. 'All right, there are 47 per cent who are with him, who are dependent upon government, who believe that they are victims, who believe the government has a responsibility to care for them, who believe that they are entitled to healthcare, to food, to housing, to you name it. 'My job is not to worry about those people. I'll never convince them they should take personal responsibility and care for their lives.'","Jindal said Romney's words 'don't represent where we are as a party and where we’re going as a party'

A baby elephant was rescued with just minutes to spare after spending over 12 hours stuck in a mudpool. The young bull was spotted with mud up to its neck by a group of tourists on safari along the Zambezi River in Africa. When the rescue team arrived it became apparent that they needed to act quickly as the baby pachyderm struggled to free its trunk and was close to drowning. Mud-dled up: The young elephant was spotted sinking into the marshland by tourists on safari along the Zambezi River in Africa . Bradley White and his wife Annelize, . owners of the nearby Imbabala Zambezi Safari Lodge in Victoria Falls, . Zimbabwe heard the call for help over the radio and immediately came to . the aid of the young elephant. After gathering a rescue team, they made several attempts to pull it from the mud before eventually setting it free. Mr White said it was likely the . elephant had become trapped the evening before and after surviving for . more than 12 hours wouldn't have lasted much longer. He said: 'Elephants are particularly . drawn to these areas and when moving towards the luscious vegetation . they become stuck and sink deep into the mud, causing them to dehydrate . and loose blood circulation to their legs.' Sticky situation: The baby elephant was found after 12 hours, stuck with mud up to his neck . Mission begins: Bradley White helps tie the ropes around the elephant's neck after wetting the mud . Lifesavers: When the rope is secured, the team begins to pull the five-year-old bull elephant out of the mud . 'If . they're not found these animals will eventually die or be eaten alive . by vultures, hyenas or any other predator that may be drawn to the . petrified screams and bellows for help. 'When we arrived on the scene it was apparent that the young elephant had been trapped in the early hours of the evening before. 'Amazingly he survived at least twelve and a half hours of this tragedy before being seen. Battle: The elephant is fighting to get out of the mudpool as the rescue team pulls him by the neck . One-two-three-pull: It took an entire team to turn the elephant around in the mud before they could attach the ropes to a car . Desperate: The poor creature fought for his life but struggled to summon the energy after 12 hours in the mud . The Whites and their recovery team . used 200 litres of water to cool the baby elephant and to soften the mud . which had begun to harden under the hot sun. 'We . also had to soften the mud that surrounded him in order to pull him . gently without damaging his legs as they were well trapped by fast . drying clay. 'Initially . we couldn't use the car as the elephant was facing the wrong direction . and by pulling him backwards we risked a chance of injury to the young . bull. 'We had to pull him by . hand for the first part of the ordeal so we could shift his weight and . have him facing the vehicle for an easier recovery.' Reward: Annelize and Bradley try to motivate the elephant to make one last push by offering it treats . Nearly there: Motivated by the nuts in Annelize's hand, the baby elephant managed to get its leg unstuck . A shower in my mud bath: Mud is washed from the elephant's face and eyes by throwing water over it . Finally out: Stretching its legs the elephant is a big shaky - but safe . 'The . only safe place to put the rope is around his neck. Elephants have a . very strong neck that can take a lot of strain. If we had tried to pull . him out by any part of his legs which eventually become exposed, we . risked breaking them. 'When . he was finally free and lay on the solid ground we had to act fast and . get him to his feet, to allow the blood to circulate. 'Towing straps were placed under his belly and with our team off staff we heaved him to his feet manually. 'So far the baby is doing well and although he is very young he is able to look after himself.

A Territorial Army soldier who battered his fiancee with a dumb-bell before slashing her across the throat because he wanted to make her look 'ugly' after she dumped him has been jailed. Jason Hughes, 40, launched a terrifying seven hour attack on Natalie Allman, 26, as she lay in bed after she ended their relationship. Despite agreeing to separate, Hughes tried to smother her with a pillow before repeatedly bludgeoning her with a dumb bell. Battered by her ex boyfriend: Natalie Allman, 26, a week after she was attacked by partner Jason Hughes . He then used the blade from a mini-tool to slash a 20cm-long cut across her throat - narrowly missing her major artery by a few millimetres. After the brutal attack at the couple's home in Ross-on-Wye, Herefordshire, on February 3 this year, Hughes refused to call an ambulance for seven hours. The couple's terrified two-year-old twin sons who witnessed the attack got into bed with their mother and were covered in her blood when they were discovered by officers. When Hughes - who was in the Territorial Army and had received training with bayonets and knives - finally let Natalie call an ambulance she had suffered eight wounds to her head and five fractures to her face bones. Hughes was jailed for nine years after he was convicted of malicious wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm at Worcester Crown Court on August 2. Defending Hughes, Abigail Nixon said if Hughes had intended to kill Natalie then he could have done so because of his military training.

She told the court: 'His intention was to cause a hideous scar she could not hide if she had dressed up to look pretty. 'He was trying to make her look ugly to other men.' Natalie, a care worker, had agreed to split with Hughes last December but continued to share a home while he found a new place to live. Natalie told the court how she had woken up to find Hughes sitting astride her hitting her with a dumb-bell. When she was allowed to dial 999 she was rushed to Hereford Hospital and Hughes was arrested by officers at the scene.

Natalie, who needed cosmetic surgery to rebuild her throat, said today: 'He was shouting at me the whole night long ""I'm going to kill you"". 'I was trying to stop him every way I could. At one point I just lay still and I think he thought I was dead so that's why he stopped. 'It started at midnight and he let me go downstairs at about 7am. He said when it gets light I could call paramedics. He hid my mobile phone all night, I kept trying to find it. 'There were three attacks, at midnight, 3am and 6am. He tried to suffocate me with the pillow all three times. 'At midnight I woke up and he was over me with one leg either side punching me. I thought it was with his fists but I later found out it was with a weight. It was pitch black in the room. 'I don't know if I fell asleep or was going unconscious but at 3am I woke up and needed the toilet. He told me to go in the bed and then frog-marched me to the toilet. 'I remember him sitting me down on the bed and that's when he slashed my throat. I don't know what happened then, I might've just passed out. 'One of our sons Ethan woke up and came into our bed with me. He was covered in my blood.' Natalie told how she was forced to call their wedding off after he began drinking heavily. She added: 'We were due to get married on February 11 but we had split up in December because I was fed up of his drinking. 'At times he could drink one litre of vodka or three litres of cider in one day. 'I was moving out the following week which he knew. He tried to make up that I had said I wouldn't let him see the children but I never said that.

A Mormon blogger has said he is facing discipline and possible excommunication by church officials over posts about Mitt Romney. David Twede's posts offer his account of the history of the church's political involvement, along with criticism of fellow Mormon and Republican presidential candidate Romney. Twede, a 47-year-old fifth-generation Mormon and the managing editor of MormonThink.com, claimed he was confronted over his posts and advised of the possible discipline at a meeting with local church leaders this week. Outspoken: David Twede has posted his opinions about the Mormon Church along with his views on Mitt Romney on his blog, landing him in hot water . In a blog post on September 17, Twede, who lives in Florida, described his meeting with church officials the day before.

Utah-based Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints declined to . comment specifically on Twede or his blog, saying that disciplinary . matters were confidential.

Prince Harry is due to deploy to the frontline in Afghanistan at the controls of an Apache helicopter after passing a rigorous training course with flying colours. He even claimed one of two best young airman awards as he qualified to crew the fearsome gunship. The 27-year-old Prince is likely to be sent to the warzone to fight the Taliban – and will join the Apache unit which has the highest 'kill rate' in Afghanistan. He could be re-deployed as early as this autumn. Top gun: Prince Harry prepares his Apache to go out on a mission in El Centro, California during his training . Qualified: Harry stands in front of his Apache Helicopter in the remote California desert in October . Harry – Captain Wales of the Army Air . Corps – gained two passes at A-Level: a B in art and a D in geography. He is said to be ‘delighted’ to have qualified as a Top Gun pilot . and has exceeded even his own expectations. In an interview a few years . ago he admitted he felt he wasn’t bright enough for the role. But sources said he amazed his instructors with his ‘natural and instinctive’ flying talent. ‘Trust me, he wouldn’t be put in charge of one of those helicopters if he wasn’t up to it,’ said a senior military source. Officers were so impressed with his aptitude for flying the £46million helicopter that he was handed the prize of top Co-pilot Gunner on his 18-month course. Commander: Harry, sat in the front seat of the Apache helicopter, gets ready for take-off. The two pilots sit one behind the other and both can fly the aircraft. However, as a Co-pilot gunner, Harry will usually be in the back seat . Deployment: The Prince could be sent back to Afghanistan to fly the helicopter as soon as the autumn . One of two crew in an Apache, the Co-pilot Gunner commands the mission, fires the weapons, navigates and sometimes takes over the controls. He received his trophy – a polished 30mm round from an Apache cannon mounted on a stand – at a dinner at Wattisham Air Station near Ipswich, where he completed his training. Colonel Neale Moss, the Apache Force Commander, said: ‘The course is extremely challenging, teaching and testing students in their flying skills, decision-making and mental agility.’ Harry has been assigned to 662 Squadron, 3 Regiment Army Air Corps. His ‘Limited Combat Ready’ status means he has proven himself in advanced mountain flying and desert training to prepare him for Afghanistan’s terrain. Part of his course included two months of advanced weapons training in California and Arizona, where the desert conditions replicate those found in Afghanistan. He will now spend at least eight months flying Apaches on exercises in the UK. The gunship - nicknamed the ‘flying tank’ - has been used by UK forces in Afghanistan to smash the Taliban, gather intelligence and provide support for soldiers on the ground and Chinook troop-carrying helicopters. Boasting a top speed of 161mph, the . helicopter is so sophisticated it can detect, classify and prioritise up . to 256 potential targets in seconds. It is so quick, fearsome and manoeuvrable that Afghan insurgents have dubbed it the ‘mosquito’ - because its bite is lethal. Military commanders singled out the . Apaches for special praise for helping defeat Colonel Gaddafi’s troops . when they were deployed to the decks of HMS Ocean during the Libya . conflict. Forces loyal to the dictator were terrified of being targeted by the fast-moving choppers - preventing them targeting pro-democracy rebels. Harry is keen to return to Afghanistan after his first tour of duty was cut short in 2008. He was secretly deployed to Helmand Province with the Household Cavalry and worked as a forward air controller directing bombing strikes against the Taliban for ten weeks. But his time there was cut short when news of his presence leaked out and he was brought back to Britain. As a result, he decided to retrain as an Army Air Corp helicopter pilot in the hope that it would increase his chances of being redeployed. Combat ready: Prince Harry sits at the controls of his Apache helicopter studying a manual. He has passed a rigorous training course with flying colours . Last April, while training for an Arctic expedition, he suggested it would be pointless to undertake costly helicopter training if he never went into combat. He said: ‘You become a very expensive asset, the training’s very expensive and they wouldn’t have me doing what I’m doing. ‘I’d just be taking up a spare place for somebody else if they didn’t have me going out on the job.’He said he would love to return to Afghanistan with ‘his brothers in arms’. The £46million helicopter gunship is very difficult to fly - and only the very best pilots ever complete the training course. With a top speed of 161mph the Apache is relatively slow - but the onboard systems are so sophisticated it can classify and prioritise up to 256 potential targets in seconds. Yet the helicopter is so difficult to master that some of the very best pilots are never able to fly it. The training is spread over 16 months - and Harry must still spend a further eight months flying the helicopters in the UK before he can be deployed despite completing the course. The two pilots sit one behind the other and it is usually the front person who is the mission commander. Harry, as the second pilot, will be in the back seat which gives better visibility. The army own 67 Apaches and have 55 crews of two pilots. They have become the aircraft of choice for fighting the Taliban. Most of the information from the sensors and radars appears in front of the pilot's right eye on the 'Helmet Display Unit'. The main weapons on the gunship are a 30mm cannon firing 625 rounds a minute, CRV-7 'point-and-fire' rockets and four air-to-air missiles. Night-flying is particularly challenging as rather than using night-vision goggles, pilots rely on forward looking infra-red which creates a video-screen picture of what lies ahead. £46million craft: One of two crew in an Apache, Harry's role as the Co-pilot Gunner sees him command the mission, fire the weapons, navigate and sometimes takes over the controls . Hi-tech: The Apache can detect, classify and prioritise up to 256 potential targets in a matter of seconds.

Mitt Romney’s VP pick revealed to The New York Times that the quartet is a top choice on his playlist, despite the band’s blatant support of leftist causes. Now the group’s guitarist, Tom Morello, is saying the conservative Midwesterner is ‘the embodiment of the Machine our music rages against.' Rage: The group's guitarist Tom Morello (left) called Rep.

Rage's sound, but not the lyrics. Well, I don't care for Paul Ryan's . sound or his lyrics' The outrage from Morello, on behalf of . RATM, comes after multiple artists have barred candidates, particularly . those of the conservative persuasion, from using their tunes at . campaign events.

The wedding dress of singer Amy Winehouse, which was about to be auctioned for charity, has been 'stolen to order' in a raid on the London home where she was found dead. She wore it to marry Blake Fielder-Civil in a ceremony in Miami, Florida, while an iconic newsprint cocktail dress from the peak of her fame was also taken. The wedding dress alone was expected to raise in excess of £100,000 for her foundation, which helps youngsters beat drugs and develop their music. Taken: This newsprint dress worn by Amy on Later With Jools Hollands was stolen along with her wedding dress - worth at least £130,000 in total . Experts believed the newsprint dress, worn on the BBC live music show Later With Jools Holland, would also have secured at least £30,000. The dresses were stolen from the performer’s Camden home in north London but it is not believed the property was broken into. They were to be sold in New York later this year. Couple: Amy married Blake in 2007 but two years later he sought a divorce . Her father Mitch told The Sun: 'It's a blow', adding 'It's sickening to know that someone would steal something in the knowledge of its sentimental value. 'Her wedding dress was only a little cotton thing thing, a hundred quid at best in the shops. Whoever nicked it realised its significance and knew it had an extra value.' He added that the house, worth around £3million, is being sold and all her possessions logged and put into storage, which is how they realised it had gone. Theft: The two dresses were taken from Winehouse's home in London, which became a shrine after her death last year . Thousands came to Camden to pay their respects, in some cases even leaving alcohol as a tribute . Inspiration: Despite problems in her private life Amy Winehouse was considered one of the great singers of recent times . Tributes: Mourners gather outside Amy's flat in Camden to pay their respects after her death in July 2011 . Because of the items’ significance, it is thought they might have been stolen to order by someone entering the property during events after her death in July last year. A spokesman for her Foundation said: 'A lot of clothes and items were left and they were being catalogued when it was realised these two were missing. 'They were going to go to the foundation but somebody might be trying to sell them for their own profit. 'People need to know they are not supposed to be out there on the market and they should not try to buy them. Saddened: Amy Winehouse's father Mitch (pictured at her funeral) says he has been left sickened by the thefts . 'The dress Amy wore on the cover of Back To Black sold for £40,000 last year and the money went to the foundation, and another dress sold for £30,000 so the wedding dress could have raised as much as £100,000. 'Both the stolen dresses are part of Amy’s story.' Scotland Yard has not received a formal complaint but it is thought the star’s father Mitch Winehouse has been speaking with a family liaison officer the Metropolitan Police gave them after his daughter’s death, which stunned the music world. Amy Winehouse drank herself to death . only hours after saying she was desperate to live because she still had . so much to achieve, her inquest was told. The . singer drank enough to stop her breathing and send her into a coma. Three empty vodka bottles were found near her body in her bedroom. A . pathologist who examined her said she had 416mg of alcohol per . decilitre of blood – five times the legal drink-drive limit of 80mg. The . inquest heard that 350mg was usually considered a fatal amount. Miss Winehouse won five Grammy awards . for her 2006 hit album Back To Black.

"By . Nick Pisa . UPDATED: . 03:39 EST, 5 March 2012 . The captain of the Costa Concordia was not wearing his glasses when the cruise ship crashed into rocks off the Italian coast, leaving more than 30 people dead, it was revealed yesterday. According to leaked prosecution evidence, Ciro  Ambrosio, the first officer of the 114,000-ton liner, described how before the crash Captain Francesco Schettino had dined with Domnica Cemortan, a Moldovan cruise rep and dancer. Ambrosio said in a statement: ‘Schettino wears glasses when he is tired. When he took command on the bridge he didn’t have them because he had left them in his cabin. He asked me to set the radar as he couldn’t see it properly. Investigation: Captain Francesco Schettino was not wearing his glasses when the ship ran aground . ‘Cemortan, the Moldovan, was on the bridge as well. She was speaking in English and arrived on the bridge the same time as Schettino. They exchanged a few words when they got on the bridge then she stayed in the background and didn’t speak.’ In further damning testimony against Schettino – dubbed Captain Coward for his alleged spineless behaviour during the tragedy – the first officer added: ‘The captain  told us not to tell the harbourmaster  anything about what had happened. He said to tell them everything was under control.’ Also in court documents is a statement from retired Costa Cruises captain Mario Palombo, who said  in a 2003 profile of Schettino that ‘professionally he is OK but he is a liar and he is too proud’. He also claimed that he had difficulty manoeuvring large ships. The disclosures came at the opening of a preliminary inquiry into the tragedy in January, which is being held in the Italian town of Grosseto. Captain Schettino, 52, is under house arrest while investigators consider charges of multiple manslaughter, causing a shipwreck, abandoning ship while passengers were still on board and failing to communicate with maritime authorities. Tragedy: The cruise ship crashed into rocks off the Italian coast, leaving more than 30 people dead . A theatre has been turned into a make-shift court for a hearing into the Costa Concordia disaster which happened two months ago . Beauty: Dominica Cemortan dined with the captain ahead of the fateful accident . It was also disclosed that prosecutor . Francesco Verusio had asked for a new charge of ‘destroying a habitat’ to be brought against Schettino, because the Concordia ran aground in . waters that are a protected maritime sanctuary and home to whales, . dolphins and other sea life. Schettino is said to have recklessly . changed the course of the Concordia, which was packed with more than . 4,000 passengers and crew,  so that he could carry out a ‘sail-by . salute’ of the Italian island of Giglio, but the vessel struck rocks, . tearing a 75-yard hole in its hull. Paolo Bastanini, one of Schettino’s . lawyers, said: ‘My client is very upset by what happened. He is upset . when he hears news that bodies have been found in the Concordia and he . was very upset to hear the news that the body of a five-year-old girl . was also recovered.’ Prosecutor Mr Verusio said that . technical experts would examine the Concordia’s black box data recorder . which registered the ship’s course and position. He said: ‘The details will give us  a . new line of investigation and also help us to ascertain if others were . also responsible for what happened that night.’ Besides Schettino, first officer . Ambrosio and two other crew  members have also been placed under formal . investigation as well as three officials from Genoa-based Costa Cruises. Thirty-five British passengers and crew were on board the Concordia at the time. Extra police have been drafted in to control onlookers at the hearing and they were warned it was a serious matter and not entertainment .

A 'devious' internet paedophile has been jailed for 14 years for raping a 12 -year-old girl after grooming her on a social networkingsite. Father of four, Gary Cooper, 47, who called himself 'Chantelle' to befriend his victim, abducted and raped her twice days after making contact with her. The girls' ordeal was described as wreaking 'incalculable psychological damage'. Cooper joined the social network . Tagged.com and began grooming the schoolgirl. He told her she was . 'gorgeous' and having got her phonenumber claimed to be the fictitious girls' father, confessing he found her attractive. Just days later, he picked up the youngster from her hometown of Basingstoke, Hants, took her back to his house and raped her. The terrified girls' phone battery had died and she could not call for help. Prosecutor . Rob Bryan said: 'Cooper said he wanted to undress her. She said she did . not want that to happen. But he took off her bra, kissed her stomach and asked if he could take her trousers off. She said no. He threatened that he would cut them off.' Cooper - who did not use a condom - raped her again five minutes later, despite her protestations that it hurt. Police stormed the house, alerted by the victim's friend, who Cooper had earlier dropped at a house in Southend, Essex. Cooper, from Hereford, told the officers: 'It's not like I have slit her throat.' The . girls had been frightened, while in his car, that Cooper would murder . them if the victim did not go home with him, the court heard. A medical examination confirmed the girl - who had been a virgin - had been raped. In a statement the girls' mother said her 'very warm-hearted, loving girl' had been transformed by her experiences last July. 'There . is not an element of our lives that has not changed and it is hard to . imagine a time when this will not be part of our lives. My . daughter finds it impossible to talk about what happened and it is this . I find hardest to cope with. To me, the day of the rape will be the day . I lost my daughter.' The Oxfam delivery driver, Cooper, had earlier pretended to be ‘Ashley Darling’, 15, to another teenage victim, the court heard. He . later told her he was 19-years-old, suffering from throat cancer and . had 'only months to live', before eventually confessing to being in his . 40s. Over a period of nine . months, he would pick her up from school in Coventry and take her to his . house at weekends, ultimately getting her pregnant.The girls' parents thought she was visiting a friend and even met Cooper, believing him to be the friends' dad. The . pair had sex at least 32 times - the first occasion was in Cooper’s van . at Watford Gap service station, which she says she went through with . because she was scared he . would make her walk home if she didn’t. He refused to use a condom or . let her take the contraceptive pill, and the child had a termination . after falling pregnant.The girl now suffers nightmares, an eating disorder and depression and has moved house in an effort to 'rebuild her life'.After . his arrest, 90 indecent photographs of children were found on his . computer and other devices, along with explicit messages. A social network site used by convicted paedophile, Cooper to groom his victims . Judge . Susan Evans sentenced him to 14 years and four months in prison . yesterday. Cooper sat slouched in his chair and showed no emotion. Evans . said: 'You are a sexual predator.

With your first victim, you . found out what her weaknesses were and sought to gain sympathy by saying . things about yourself. It . seems to me it was a determined and sophisticated piece of grooming, . inventing as you did a daughter as a cover story for yourself.' A . 12 year-old stood 'no chance' of fighting him off, Judge Evans said. She added: 'It is rare to find genital injury but it is a measure of . your brutality to that child that that was found.

Tensions between Japan and China escalated further today after thousands of Chinese protesters took to the streets and overturned Japanese cars. The demonstrations were the latest in an ongoing feud between the two countries over a group of disputed islands in the East China Sea. Chinese protesters denounced Japan's claims to the islands - which are known as the Diaoyu in China and as the Senkaku in Japan. Scroll down for video . Rising tensions: Protesters in Hangzhou, China, hold placards and banners at a demonstration against Japan's claim of the disputed islands . Tokyo responded by urging China to protect Japanese citizens. The demonstrations came after 10 Japanese nationalists swam to the islands on Sunday in a tit-for-tat move following a similar landing by Chinese activists last week. Both China’s government and Japan’s Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda are under domestic pressure to take a tough stance over the islands. But economic ties between the two countries are deeper than ever, and both are thought to be keen to prevent the feud spiralling out of control. Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Osamu Fujimura said that they were anxious to contain the situation. Feud: Demonstrators carrying Chinese national flags attend an anti-Japan protest in Shenzhen, southern China . 'We would like to continue to deepen mutually beneficial relations between Japan and China, keeping a broader perspective in mind,' he said. 'Regarding the protests in China, we are asking, above all, to ensure the safety of Japanese nationals (in China).' The anti-Japanese protests in part reflect bitter Chinese memories of Japan’s occupation of large parts of China in the 1930s and 1940s. Chinese mainstream media were critical of Japan, but some also suggested that violent protest was not the way to proceed. Protests: Pro-China activists in Hong Kong have also taken part in demonstrations, waving Chinese flags and chanting slogans such as 'Down with Japanese militarism' 'Japan has made a series of mistakes . in the Diaoyu Island issue, and has hurt the Chinese people’s feelings,' said the China Youth Daily.

Human rights activists in Pakistan are demanding the release of a Christian girl accused of burning pages of the Koran, after a bail hearing was adjourned. Religious and secular groups worldwide have protested over the arrest this month of Rimsha Masih who reportedly suffers from Downs Syndrome after she was accused of blasphemy by Muslim neighbours. A hospital said in a report Rimsha was about 14 but had the mental capacities of someone below that age and was uneducated. Other media have reported she is 11. Scroll down for video . Reporters and residents gather outside a mosque near the locked home of Rimsha Masih, a Pakistani Christian girl facing the death penalty for burning pages of the Koran . Under the blasphemy law, anyone who speaks ill of Islam and the Prophet Mohammad commits a crime and faces the death penalty, but activists say vague terminology has led to its misuse. Convictions are common, although the death sentence has never been carried out. Most convictions are thrown out on appeal, but mobs have killed many people accused of blasphemy. Rao Abdur Raheem, a lawyer representing the accuser in the case, complained a medical report was conducted without a court order . Human rights groups say the law dangerously discriminates against the Muslim country's tiny minority groups. 'This will go on and on and this little minor girl will rot in jail,' said human rights activist Tahira Abdullah outside an Islamabad court. 'We want her out of jail. We want her under protection.' Rao Abdur Raheem, a lawyer representing the accuser in the case, said the medical report was conducted without a court order, prompting the bail hearing to be postponed until September 1. 'She could get 110 per cent punishment,' he said. Masih's arrest triggered an exodus of several hundred Christians from her poor village on the edge of the capital, Islamabad, after mosques reported over their loudspeakers what the girl was alleged to have done. Christians, who make up four percent of Pakistan's population of 180 million, have been especially concerned about the blasphemy law, saying it offers them no protection. Convictions hinge on witness testimony and are often linked to vendettas, they complain. In 2009, 40 houses and a church were set ablaze by a mob of 1,000 Muslims in the town of Gojra, in Punjab province. Children sit in front of the locked family house of Rimsha Masih who reportedly suffers from Downs Syndrome and was accused by Muslim neighbours of burning Islamic religious texts . Run-down: Children play in a slum area on the outskirts of Islamabad, Pakistan, close to the town of Mehrabadi where the 11-year-old girl lives . At least seven Christians were burned to death.

Prophet Mohammad were gunned down outside a court in the eastern city of . Faisalabad in July of 2010. Sacred: A Pakistani Muslim woman holds up a copy of the Islamic holy text the Koran . 'We are just praying for her and we hope that she will be released soon,' said Christian activist Xavier William. In .

Luis Suarez pounced on a Jamie Carragher header to snatch a draw for Liverpool at Stamford Bridge. John Terry opened the scoring before being carried off having collided with Suarez in the first half, but Chelsea succumbed to pressure in the 73rd minute. Click here to read the full report . John Terry's return to Chelsea's starting line-up was cut short by a nasty-looking injury in the first half against Liverpool - just 15 minutes after he bagged a goal. Terry, back in the side for the first time having served a four-match ban for racially abusing Anton Ferdinand, was carried off while holding his face and screaming in agony after Liverpool striker Luis Suarez slipped and landed awkwardly on the 31-year-old's knee. The European champions have an anxious wait ahead of them, as Terry will undergo an MRI scan at 9am tomorrow morning on the injured right knee. Suarez took to Twitter to offer his condolences to Terry, posting on his official Twitter page: 'A shame we could't get the three points. Game over: John Terry's return was cut short . As it happened: Luis Suarez lost control, slipped and landed with all his weight on Terry's knee . 'Glad to to help the team with another goal... Hugs to Terry, I hope it's nothing serious.' Gary Cahill hastily stepped in for . Terry in the 37th minute, who seemed to know immediately that he would . be unable to continue, putting up a hand to indicate the need for a . substitution. Little more than fifteen minutes earlier, Terry was enjoying a dream return to the fray. The Chelsea captain powered home a header to put his side a goal up at Stamford Bridge. Juan Mata found the unmarked former England international in the box from a corner, who obliged by glancing his effort past a stranded Brad Jones. Terry's subsequent injury was clearly an accident, and no blame could be attributed to Suarez. The Uruguayan bore down on Terry with the ball at his feet while being pursued by Ramires. Bizarre: Luis Suarez tweeted 'hugs' to John Terry after the accidental collision . Terry stood square on as Suarez - who slipped, or was perhaps nudged from behind by Ramires - fell, landing with all his weight on the centre back's outstretched right leg. After five minutes of on-pitch treatment, Terry was carried off and straight down the tunnel past manager Roberto Di Matteo, who attempted to console him. Suarez looked concerned as he stood over his injured opponent. But the striker showed little mercy later in the game as he latched onto a Jamie Carragher header to nod home from close range. Di Matteo revealed the club did not know the extent of Terry's knee injury with the captain set for a scan tomorrow. The Italian told Sky Sports 1: 'He has a problem with his knee and will have an MRI scan tomorrow. Ecstasy to agony: Terry scored his team's only goal of the afternoon (left) before leaving Stamford Bridge on crutches (right) Hobbling: Terry (left) had his leg in a brace as he left the Chelsea ground . 'At the moment we can't say, we'll have to wait for the scan which will tell us the extent of the injury. He is certainly a player that is influential for us. We will miss him.' He added: 'When a player reacts like that, it's a concern. He's in pain now. He'll go to hospital tomorrow for a scan. 'We hope it's not a serious injury, but we'll see.' Terry was consoled by Di Matteo before disappearing down the tunnel to receive treatment before returning home. 'I was concerned about his well-being,' the Italian added. 'We just got him back into the team after the ban. It was great seeing him out there.' 'He started the game very well, showing the qualities he has, and the experience and influence. 'It's a real shame he had to come off as he was having a very good game.' To make matters worse, Ashley Cole was already out with a hamstring problem and David Luiz missed Liverpool's visit with tonsillitis. Di Matteo is hoping to dodge a defensive crisis, and said he was 'hopeful' the pair would be fit in time for Saturday's trip to West Brom. Ouch: Luis Suarez accidentally ended up landing on Terry's knee . Concern: The Uruguayan attempted to comfort Terry after the incident . 'At centre-back we have cover,' said . Di Matteo, who was slightly less optimistic about Frank Lampard's . return, who missed today's game with a calf problem. Di Matteo added: 'Lamps, it might be a bit too early, but he won't be long after that.' The skipper left the Bridge at around 6:30pm. His right leg was tightly bound as he departed on crutches. Terry was back in the Chelsea . starting line-up for the first time after serving his four-match ban for . racially abusing Anton Ferdinand last season. Di Matteo decided not to use Terry in . the Champions League last week, as he felt he was not ready to make his . return after spending a lengthy period on the sidelines.

Carried off: Medics were on hand to get Terry off the field, cutting his return short .

'I don't think anybody's guaranteed a starting place.' 'They all have to work and be fighting for their place in the team.'

The show is months from curtain up but there is already heightened drama surrounding one Broadway musical - although it has mostly taken place off stage. Rebecca, the musical adaptation of the novel by Daphne Du Maurier, is now in jeopardy after a major but secretive investor pulled out in dubious circumstances. Paul Abrams had promised a staggering $4.5million to lead producer Ben Sprecher to stage the musical at the Broadhurst Theater on Broadway. Theatrics: Rebecca is due to open on Broadway in November but the run is in doubt after a shadowy investor Paul Abrams pulled out of his $4.5 million investment . However before Mr Abrams, a shadowy character based in Britain, could produce the millions he mysteriously died of malaria, according to his associates last month. However no obituary has ever appeared and the only person connected to estate to come forward is an equally unknown individual called 'Wexler'. It was revealed last week, according to the New York Times, that Mr Sprecher had never even met Abrams. Mr Sprecher confirmed to the Times . that his cast would be paid this week but rehearsals delayed until new, . unnamed investors paid up. The final curtain? Although Broadway productions are always cloak-and-dagger operations, the financial wrangling behind Rebecca has left many in the theater community stunned . Sprecher, a seasoned off-Broadway producer, had dealt with Abrams only by phone after his leading investor canceled a trip to New York for a face-to-face meeting. Drama: Ben Sprecher's production of Rebecca has been left with a $4.5million shortfall . After Abram's death, Mr Sprecher flew to London to try and extract money from his investor's estate. However he never met any representative in person, dealing only with 'Wexler' by email. The disappearance of such a wealthy investor leaves a huge hole in funding for the $12million musical. It also leaves Sprecher's companies liable for millions of dollars to other investors. Robert E. Wankel, a major Broadway . player, invested a vast sum . in Rebecca and owns the Broadhurst Theater where it is intended to be . staged come November. He told the Times: 'Broadway does business in its own . strange way, I’ll grant you. 'But this is the . strangest bit of show business to come along in a long time.' On the show's website it states that rehearsals for Rebecca have been postponed due to the 'tragic death of one of Rebecca's key investors'. However tickets are still be purchased via the website. Calls to The Sprecher Organization by MailOnline went unanswered. The musical version of Rebecca opened . in September 2006 in Vienna, Austria where it played for more than three years. Productions have been staged across Europe and at the Imperial Theater in Tokyo to great successs. Four years ago, plans began to . move the entire production to the Broadway stage but complications in . sets and special effects saw the effort cancelled. Mr Sprecher's production is due to open on November 18, starring Jill Plaice, Ryan Silverman and Karen Mason in the lead roles.

When she arrives to set up home at his Manderley Estate, she finds the housekeeper Mrs Danvers devoted to de Winter's last wife Rebecca who died in mysterious circumstances.

When you're the Queen, the role of 'back seat driver' becomes a rather more esteemed position. It means full control of a 'traffic light system' - with the capability of ordering the driver when to stop, slow or start at the touch of the button. Her Majesty commissioned a green Land Rover Series III in 1978 with such functions and it is now up for sale to the highest bidder. The Royal vehicle, built for the Queen, is expected to fetch between £15,00 and £18,000 when it goes up for sale at an auction . The vehicle comes complete with a 'traffic light' system which the Queen used to control the driver of the time and tell them when she wanted to stop, slow down or start the journey . In 1979 the vehicle was sent to a workshop where engineers fitted the 4x4 with an unconventional ‘traffic light system’, allowing Queen Elizabeth II to control the vehicle. And despite being almost 35 years old, the car - dubbed The Queen’s Land Rover - has covered just 1,892 miles from new and appears to be in almost perfect condition. The vehicle, perfect for a Head of State, is being sold by the Ministry of Defence. The industrious off-roader is being auctioned on Saturday November 24 at the Historics at Brooklands near Weybridge, Surrey. It is being offered at the bargain estimate of between £15,000 and £18,000 but, because it is owned by the MoD, is subject to VAT if sold within the EU. A Land Rover used by Sir Winston Churchill recently sold for £129,000 - more than twice its initial estimate. And Frank King, from the Land Rover Series 3 Owners Club, believes £15,000 for the Queen’s old model would be a bargain. The front seat where a light would show up on the driver's control box which would tell him what the Queen wanted to do in the back . Despite the vehicle being almost 35-years-old, it has covered just 1,892 miles . He said: 'It is a very special model and I am sure it will attract a lot of interest. 'The fact it was used by the Queen makes it all the more interesting and a £15,000 estimate seems stupidly low. 'I think it will sell for a lot more with that provenance and hopefully it will go to a museum and someone will look after it.' The Series III was the most common Land Rover with 440,000 built at the company’s factory in Solihull between 1971 and 1985. Fit for a Queen: Side-profile of the 1978 Land Rover Series 3 . Designed to be robust and easy to repair, it has been claimed that 70 per cent of all Land Rovers are still on the road - although very few will have a mileage as low as the Queen’s. Edward Bridger-Stille, director at Historics Auction, said: 'We are excited and honoured to be entrusted with the task of finding a new home for such a unique vehicle. 'We pride ourselves on bringing distinctive vehicles to auction, and despite prolific production of the Series III Land Rover, it’s highly unlikely one like this will ever come to auction again.'","Queen controlled car's main driver using buttons to say stop, slow or start .

Prime Minister David Cameron said it was his 'intention' for his children to go to a state school . David Cameron has said for the first time that he wants to send his children to a state secondary school. Answering questions from youngsters in a new academy, the old Etonian said it was his ‘intention’ that his children would not follow in his footsteps and go to public school. The Prime Minister said that what was happening in the state school system was ‘really exciting’. ‘I think there’s a revolution taking place,’ he said. If he keeps his promise, it would make him the first Conservative PM to entrust his children to the state secondary education system while in Downing Street. His openness about his children’s education is in stark contrast to his deputy Nick Clegg, who has always refused to answer the question. It is believed that Mr Cameron wants to send his children to the new Kensington Aldridge academy, which is set to open in 2014 near their old family home in west London. The two eldest – Nancy, eight, and Elwen, six – are already state educated. They go to St Mary Abbots CofE primary school in Kensington. A decision on Nancy’s secondary education will be required before the next election, as she will soon reach the age of 11. Their third child, Florence, is only two but it is likely that she will also go to a state primary. Mr Cameron revealed his plans during a question and answer session at the John Cabot Academy in Bristol, where along with his ministers he had held a regional Cabinet meeting in the morning. He said he wanted to send his three children to state secondaries, even though he himself went to Eton. The Prime Minister was asked by pupil Reece Day, from the Bristol Brunel Academy: ‘If you agree with academies, would you send your children to an academy, rather than a public school?’ The Tory leader replied: ‘I’ve got three children, an eight-year-old, a six-year-old and a two-year-old. ‘My eight-year-old and six-year-old are at a London state school. It’s a church school but it’s a very good school and I’m very happy with it. The Prime Minister was speaking to children at John Cabot Academy in Bristol yesterday where he was grilled by a group of 11 to 16-year-olds . The Kensington Aldridge Academy, which is set to open in 2014, may be a state school but it's unlikely to ever be considered 'bog standard'. While its admissions policy has not been decided yet, the policy is expected to be non-selective and community based. However, its community is set in one of London's richest postcodes in the Royal Borough of Kensington and . Chelsea where house prices nearby average £1million. In its proposal to the council, the Aldridge Foundation, which is sponsoring the school, said it would: 'Provide a mixed 11 to 18 school with places for 900 11 to 16-year-olds and provide a sixth form for up to 240 students.' The first group of 11-year-olds are expected to start in September 2014, with a second group starting the following September. Among its aims are to 'provide a community entrepreneurial hub'. ‘I packed them off there this morning . and they’re not too happy about all these tests they’re having to sit . but they are doing well. ‘I . would like them to go to state schools, that is my intention. What’s . happening in the state school system I think is really exciting. I think . there’s a revolution taking place.’ It was reported last year that the Camerons were also considering two other London state schools — Grey Coat Hospital school, a Church of England girls' comprehensive in Westminster; and the new Chelsea academy in west London. In 2010, Cameron said he was ‘terrified living in central London... Am I going to find a good secondary school for my children? I feel it as a parent, let alone as a politician.’ The co-sponsor of the Kensington academy is Rod Aldridge, a tycoon who had to step down from the Capita business services company after it emerged he had lent Labour £1million while it was bidding for government contracts. When Tony Blair was Prime Minister, he attracted controversy by sending his children to the Roman Catholic London Oratory school. Critics said it selected by parental interview, which favoured the professional middle classes. In addition, he and his wife, Cherie, used teachers from the independent Westminster school to give his sons Euan and Nicky extra tuition.","Prime Minister reveals is is 'intention' that his three children will not follow in his footsteps to private education .

Final bid: Cleric Abu Hamza has made yet another plea to the High Court to stay in Britain but it is likely to fail . Hate preacher Abu Hamza was accused of ‘playing the system’ last night after his  lawyers launched another legal bid to block his extradition. The hook-handed cleric’s legal team got a court ruling preventing him from being sent to the US while the latest application is dealt with. It is thought they will argue his physical and mental health has deteriorated so much that he is not fit to stand trial on terror charges. Whitehall sources said Hamza’s legal team – who have already earned more than half a million pounds in legal aid from representing him – were ‘playing the system’. A source added: ‘We’re still confident he’ll be out of the country soon.’ Home Office officials have predicted it will take two to three weeks to arrange Hamza’s removal from the country and into the custody of US marshals. Hamza was told on Monday that his appeal to the European Court of Human Rights had failed. He had claimed that a potential jail term of up to 50 years without parole would breach his human right to be protected from ‘inhuman or degrading treatment’. In April the ECHR rejected that claim, but he was given a further right of appeal. He asked the court’s highest body, the Grand Chamber, to reconsider, but that was rejected on Monday night. He took his case to Strasbourg . following years of delays caused by countless legal challenges in this . country – all of which failed. Worshippers: Hamza (pictured centre, wearing blue)preached hate on the streets of Britain . The basis of cleric Abu Hamza's latest appeal to the High Court has not yet been revealed, with the Judicial Service only confirming the preacher and one other terror suspect are 'seeking injunctions preventing their removal from the UK'. Hamza's application has stopped the extradition process - but only very briefly - as his request for an injunction will be considered on Tuesday. If he loses, the Government's target of getting him on a plane to the United States within two weeks will still be on track. If he wins, then the legal process will begin again, with the Home Office sure to appeal the decision. Whatever Hamza's taxpayer-funded legal team argues next week, they have to prove to the judge that there has been a 'new and compelling' change in the cleric's argument to stay, which crucially has not been considered in the eight years of cases that have cost the taxpayer millions and clogged up the courts since his conviction for soliciting murder and racial hatred in Britain. Legal experts have suggested his latest act will be futile, and he is 'playing the system' and 'very unlikely' to prevent his extradition to America. The High Court said the case for his removal was ‘unassailable’. The US authorities want to put Hamza . on trial for plotting to set up a jihadi training camp in  Oregon. He is . also accused of taking part in a kidnapping plot in the Yemen. His notoriety in this country comes from his fanatical sermons delivered outside the Finsbury Park mosque in North London. He is credited with turning dozens of young men to his radical and hate-filled ideology. Since 2004, he has been held in the . high-security unit at Belmarsh prison – the so-called ‘prison within a . prison’ – at a cost to taxpayers of about £50,000 a year. A hearing on whether the extradition . should be blocked will be held next Tuesday, before Sir  John Thomas, . President of the Queen’s Bench Division, and Mr Justice Ouseley. A second terror suspect, Khaled . Al-Fawwaz, whose case was dealt with in Strasbourg at the same time as . Hamza’s, has also launched an appeal. Al-Fawwaz is wanted for his alleged . involvement in the bombing of US embassies in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam . in 1998. He faces more than 269 counts of murder.

Mother-of-three Sarah Burge justifies giving her daughters Botox injections . A mother-of-three, dubbed the 'Human Barbie' because of her obsession with plastic surgery, has been slammed by a U.S. chat show host. Anderson Cooper was forced to cut a TV interview with Sarah Burge short  as she justified giving her teenage daughter Botox injections. 'I would prefer to oversee my daughter's Botox than have her going underground finding a voodoo witchdoctor or getting it off the internet and administrating it herself,' she said defiantly. But appalled by her behaviour, Anderson shook his head in disbelief stating: 'I try and to be really polite to all my guests. 'I just think you're dreadful and I honestly don’t want to talk to you anymore, so I’m just going to stop.' The 51-year-old, self-confessed plastic surgery addict recently relocated to the U.S. to launch her eight-year-old Poppy as a child beauty pageant star, believing she could give the stars of the controversial show Toddlers & Tiaras a run for their money. However her insistence on teaching her young daughters to pole dance, giving them vouchers to spend on plastic surgery and throwing them Botox parties is proving unpopular on both sides of the Atlantic. Following the show Anderson added: 'I regret having here on in the first place. 'I think encouraging her little daughter to pole dance and giving her plastic surgery vouchers and then telling the media about it... 'I wish her the best, I certainly don’t want to be rude to anybody.' Miss Burge, who has spent more than £500,000 on her own surgical enhancements, first made headlines in 2010 when she confessed to teaching her then six-year-old daughter to pole dance. And she has since been in the spotlight numerous times - for all the wrong reasons. Last year Miss Burge, who then resided in a £500,000 four-bedroom home in St Neots, Cambridgeshire, boasted that she gave a £6,000 breast enlargement voucher to her daughter. She said in an interview with Closer magazine at the time: 'Poppy begged me for a boob job, so I gave her the voucher so she can have it after she's 16, when it's legal. If she develops naturally big boobs, she can have something else done with it.' The voucher was part of a £12,000 'exotic pamper party' that she organised to mark her daughter's birthday. Poppy and seven friends had manicures, pedicures and makeovers. They dressed up with fake tattoos, drank pretend champagne in the back of a pink pamper bus and ate a designer cake costing £250. 'I honestly don't want to talk to you anymore so I'm just going to stop,' Anderson told Miss Burge . Poppy wore a £300 dress for the party, adding nail varnish, eyeshadow and hair extensions. Miss Burge said: 'Poppy isn't interested in bouncy castles or pass the parcel, so I splashed out on something a little more grown-up. 'The girls got lots of attention from our neighbours. They love having all eyes on them and were posing and pouting for photos,' she said. As well as the breast enlargement voucher, Miss Burge bought her daughter thousands of pounds worth of gifts, including a £250 computer, a £450 pink Swarovski crystal ring and necklace set and the promise of a £4,000 spa break. The main event though, was the breast enlargement voucher. Poppy said: 'I wanted a new computer, a holiday and a voucher for surgery. When I got it all, it was a dream come true. All my friends were jealous. 'I can't wait to be like Mummy with big boobs. They're pretty.' Anderson also asked Burge to explain the photos of her eight-year-old daughter (who was seven at the time) on a stripper pole, and points out, 'It doesn't just happen to wind up in the paper, you contact the British tabloids, you contact the papers and let them know about this stuff.' Burge responded: 'I let people know that it's good, it's good exercise and in fact, more people should actually try it than stuffing their faces with burgers.'

Animal control officers are hunting for kittens believed to be infected with rabies that were given away in a supermarket car park. Cat-lovers in Georgia, U.S., may have unwittingly adopted a kitten infected with the deadly disease after two women were spotted handing out six of the animals outside a Walmart in Henry County. One of the kittens was found to be rabid . when it was brought to a vet after scratching its new owner then . becoming lethargic - a symptom of the virus. Rabid: Surveillance cameras outside Walmart in McDonough, Henry County, showed two women giving away six kittens . Officers from Henry County Animal . Control - who are now urgently trying to locate the other kittens - . warned it was 'highly likely' the remaining five were also carrying the . infectious disease, which can be passed to humans through an animal bite . or scratch. Rabies . Control Officer Vince Farah told Georgia's Channel 2 News it was vital . that anybody who had come into contact with the kittens be identified. 'If one kitten was positive it's highly likely the others are positive for rabies as well,' he said. Officials believe the kittens' mother may have contracted rabies while it was pregnant and passed it on to the litter. 'Life-threatening': Animal control officer Vince Farah said it was 'highly likely' the other five kittens are also infected with rabies . Rabies alert: Animal control officers are urgently trying to trace the kittens and anyone that has handled them . A man who brought one of the kittens . home took it to a 24-hour veterinary clinic after it scratched his wife . and then began acting lethargic. The . animal was put down because the vet did not believe it would survive a . 10 day quarantine. Its remains tested positive for rabies. The owner had accepted the kitten from two women outside the McDonough Walmart on August 25. It . is not known whether the women, who were captured on CCTV camera giving . away six of the animals, were aware that one or more of the kittens . were rabid. The supermarket said it had been unaware of what the women were doing. Mr Farah said: 'We do not know who handled these kittens. We don't know who the women were giving the kittens away. 'It's urgent that those who came in contact with the cats be identified because rabies is life-threatening. 'If gone untreated, death. That's the bottom line,' he said. If an animal infected with rabies bites or scratches a human, the virus can spread to the brain through the nervous system. Once the symptoms of rabies - which include fever and hallucinations - have developed, the condition is almost always fatal.

The body of Winston Fernandez, 69, lay undiscovered for almost a month after £600-a-night Russian prostitute Natalia Woolley, 38, allegedly kicked him to death. Guildford Crown Court today heard how . the widower had got into rows with other call girls in the past and had . bank cards and other items stolen from him. 'Not doing the business': Retired Winston Fernandez, 69, who was allegedly beaten to death by Russian escort Natalia Woolley, 38, had complained to his handyman about the behaviour of his prostitutes the day he died . Mr Fernandez, who allegedly kept . records of the girls and their chest sizes, complained to his handyman . that he was annoyed at the prostitutes 'not doing the business' just hours before he died. Jurors previously heard the Mr Fernandez and escort Woolley got into a fight . during an appointment at Mr Fernandez’s house in Epsom, Surrey, after . she arrived at 7.30pm on January 16 this year. The Russian-born escort claims he had locked her in and she hit and kicked him in . self-defence in her bid to escape. Jurors heard how the . 69-year-old had become a regular client of escort agencies towards the . end of his life and had been prescribed Viagra. Russian prostitute Natalia Woolley, 38, claims she hit and kicked the widower in self-defence . He suffered from numerous medical . conditions, including high blood pressure, high cholesterol, skin . ailments, a fungal infection and cramp. He also had weak limbs and . shuffled when he walked. He also suffered from depression and . possibly bipolar disorder but his main problem was an addiction to . alcohol which saw him drink large amounts of beer and wine. Even seven years before he died, the retired accountant was drinking three litres of wine a day. Mr Fernandez sought companionship with . the female escorts after his wife passed away in 2000 and he became . estranged from his sons. Mr Fernandez spoke about the . prostitutes to handyman Alan Horsman when he visited his house, in . Ewell, Surrey, on January 16 - the day prosecutors believed he died. Mr Horsman later informed police: 'He . told me he had three call girls come round. He said two of them had not . done the business and they had taken his money and went. 'One did do the business. He seemed annoyed about it.' Emma Johnson, who saw Mr Fernandez a . number of times and early on January 16 during her four months as an . escort, described him as 'a nice, lonely man'. Ms Johnson, who used the name Emily Jane while working for Diamond Escorts, said he had told her about a girl called Ruby.

Surrey Police. 'He was quite open about the fact that . he would see other escorts and he would actually write down on pieces . of paper their names and their chest size and almost compare what he had . purchased.' 'Sexy and curvaceous': The call girl - who plied her trade under the aliases Lenka and Alice - is alleged to have broken 17 of the old man's ribs and fractured the bones in his windpipe in the brutal assault before cutting his phone lines as she left . Ms Johnson went to see Mr Fernandez in the early hours of January 16, spending two hours with him. She and her driver took him to a supermarket to buy whisky and to go to a cashpoint before they returned to his house. She said: 'He was quite slow. He . needed help. It wasn’t because he was drunk. I think he would have . needed that much help even if he wasn’t. 'I always thought to myself he wasn’t that healthy.' She admitted he could be controlling . by noting down how long a girl had been with him and would insist on . being the person to contact their agency when the girl arrived. Under cross examination by David . Lederman QC, for the defence, she admitted that he was deteriorating . during the brief time she knew him. She said he had seemed stressed . because of a pending court case connected to his drunkenness but that . when she left he was asleep and 'looked quite content'. She added: 'I know he could be tricky. I just blame that on alcohol, but I never had any problems with him personally.' Suzanna Fariday, the operations . manager for Diamond Escorts, would dispatch girls to clients and spoke . to Winston Fernandez on numerous occasions. Scene: Woolley is accused of murdering 69-year-old Winston Fernandez with her cowboy boots after he invited her to his £1million mansion (above) in Epsom, Surrey, for sex . She said: 'He became a regular client. He started using us around November, then from December he started . booking a lot of girls from our agency.' She confirmed that after seeing Emily . Jane between 4.15 and 6.15am on January 16, Mr Fernandez had then called . at 7pm to book another girl, Nicole. However, he called again an hour later to cancel the booking. She remembered her conversations with . him, telling the court: 'To me he sounded like a very lonely old man who . has been drinking quite a bit. 'He was really nice. He liked to share his story about his family with us. 'He was a nice man. He was not horrible to us. We sent lots of girls. We didn’t have problems.' Jurors have heard how Mr Fernandez had . suffered multiple injuries, including bruises from his head to his . legs, with 17 broken ribs and two fractures to bones in his neck. Prosecutors allege they were caused by kicking and stamping and cannot be explained by the account Woolley gave to police.

Rumors have been circulating since Femme by Ashley customers started noticing the large 'rock' on Ms Dupre's finger and her obviously swollen stomach this summer, but details of the wedding plans and sex of the baby are being kept a secret. Asked about her pregnancy, Ms Dupre told the New York Post in August: 'So far so good!' She and Mr Earle began an illicit affair shortly after news of her dealings with Mr Spitzer hit the headlines but the asphalt heir was still married to wife Alisa with whom he has two children.

A pet owner watched in horror as his dog was mauled to death after being dragged under water by a seal. Matthew Will, 21, had taken his labrador Fly to an Aberdeenshire beach so his dog could fetch the bodies of ducks that he was shooting. As Fly ran into the water to pick up a bird a seal pulled the three-year-old dog beneath the water and ripped into it. Fly had been helping his owner when the huge seal 'threw him around in the water' and he suffered fatal injuries . Mr Will ran into the water to try and save his pet but it was too late for Fly, who had suffered fatal injuries. The dog died after he was attacked in the North Sea near Newburgh, Aberdeenshire. Upset: Matthew Will could only watch as a seal killed his dog Fly . Mr Will, of Inverugie, Peterhead, said: 'There was a sudden and terrific thrashing and howling in the water. 'I shone my torch towards where Fly had gone in to bring out the duck. 'But this huge seal, more than twice the size of the dog, was flinging Fly around and pulling him under the water. I was horrified. The seal was enormous. 'Both his hind legs were completely crushed and mangled, his rib cage smashed and his left eye torn out. He was pouring with blood and in spasms of agony. 'I’m still trying to come to terms with it all. Now I just want to warn other dog-owners of the danger so that they won’t have to face the same anguish and horror that I have.' Fly was killed by the seal on Friday evening after running into the water at the mouth of the Tarty Burn river. Local environmentalist Bob Davis said attacks by seals were very rare and unusual. He said: 'Seals are fish-eaters, and the attack on the dog may have been a defensive response.' Local fishery manager Audrey Forbes-Clarke said warning signs had now been installed. Culprit: One of the huge seals ripped into the faithful pet dog as it raced ot find a duck . Normally regarded as adorable sea creatures, the grey seal (known as the hook-nosed sea pig) is actually a formidable creature. Bulls can reach 8 to 11 ft long and weigh between 170–310 kg, while the cows are much smaller, typically sized between 5 and 6.6 ft long and reaching between 100 to 190 kg in weight. The grey seal breeds in colonies around the northern coasts of Great Britain and Ireland and are protected by a Conservation Act. The curious creatures, who can be seen basking on rocks and on sand, typically eat shellfish, fish and octopus.","'He was pouring with blood and in spasms of agony.

HE is a cold-blooded assassin who has been waiting in the shadows since vanishing more than five years ago. But now Agent 47 has returned. His motive? Revenge. A dish best served cold and he's been fine-tuning his recipe. Hounded by the police, 47 finds himself in the middle of a dark conspiracy. He must embark on a journey through a corrupt and twisted world, in his quest for the truth. Hidden warrior: Agent 47 carefully lines up his target from an apartment window . What the Hitman franchise does is deliver choice. You could walk up in the street and blast the target. Take him out from distance. Or, in true silent assassin fashion, set up certain booby traps and make the guy's death look like an accident. Hitman: Blood Money was brilliant, but Absolution will be worth the wait. It has been built from the ground up, boasting a cinematic story, distinctive art direction and highly original game design. It combines much-loved classic gameplay with completely new features for the franchise. The Glacier 2 engine is a remarkable piece of precise engineering - squeezing the last drop of power from the aging consoles and providing a visual tour-de-force on high-end PCs. Everything has a sort of ‘Hollywood sheen’. From the dank, dark suburbs teeming with intricate details, to the vast, sun-kissed vistas which stretch draw distance to its limit. The man himself is brilliantly detailed, too – his wrinkles and realistic skin are a far cry from the slightly cartoon-like 47 of the past. Wonderful animations enforce the idea that 47 is a living, breathing man, who although skilled – is not quite invincible. Hit in the making: If being quiet is not your thing, you can run in all guns blazing . Absolution has much more depth than before. One addition is ‘instinct mode’. This will let 47 predict enemy patrols – think Batman: Arkham Asylum spliced with Splinter Cell: Conviction. This is optional so it won’t dictate the way you play. However, similar to Splinter Cell, if things get too hectic, you’ll be able to mark and slow-motion execute targets. This is a refreshing move as ‘open’ combat in the previous Hitman games wasn’t quite as solid as it should have been. In Blood Money, it was almost impossible to avoid the tendency to restart the level if a hit went wrong. The player was often swarmed by (not-too-bright) AI guards who would bound gleefully into the path of a rapid-firing machine gun – resulting in a mini massacre. Absolution also has a lovely touch, where, if you get too close to an enemy, the camera slows down – and you’ll see the guy double-take you. Tense moments: Agent 47 must slip past these cops . They also have memory, so don’t expect to take a guy out when someone’s back is turned, for them to turn around and not realise ‘that engineer’ now looks nothing like the guy who was there a second ago. Surprisingly, the developer has said that only 20 per cent of Absolution's players will see the game's ending. Speaking to Official Playstation Magazine, Tore Blystad, game director for IO Interactive, said: 'We are using metrics a lot more now than we did, for good and for . bad. The general player will probably never even finish the game, which . is very sad.

A schoolgirl has to spend up to 12 hours a day under a bright blue ultra violet light to prevent her skin from turning yellow because of a rare liver condition. Brianna Minnich, nine, spends each night sleeping under UV lights that help battle a rare disease that can sometimes lead to brain damage. Her skin and eyes turn yellow whenever she has a sudden change in mood caused by illness, injury, stress, being bullied at school or even arguing with her brother. Scroll down for video . Sleeping beauty: Brianna Minnich, nine, spends each night sleeping under UV lights to help her battle a rare kidney condition . Lighting up the night: Brianna suffers from a rare condition called Crigler-Najjar syndrome that only around 200 patients in the world have . Brianna, from Whitehall, Pennsylvania, has Crigler-Najjar syndrome - a condition so rare that only around 200 patients in the world suffer from it. Her illness means she has dangerously high levels of bilirubin - a naturally occurring waste product from the blood that is usually broken down by an enzyme in the liver - that the UV rays help to lower. The UV rays from the blue light affect . the bilirubin in her system when they come into contact with her red . blood cells and skin tissue. By helping to manage bilirubin levels in . her body and keep them at an acceptable level, Brianna is saved from . any long term damage. Unusual: The condition causes her body to turn yellow if she comes under any sort of stress . Currently Brianna has to sleep under a 4ft bank of photo-therapy lights over her be but as she gets older it’s likely she’ll need a liver transplant. Her father Bob, 29, said: 'Her bilirubin levels were considerably high, right up in the high twenties for the first month or so after being born. 'We were told soon after the diagnosis that she was only the 52nd person in the country to have the disorder and just the 212th in the world. 'In the past three or four years her body has maintained a much more steady level of around 10-15 - the average person has a level of around 0.5 so it’s still very high. 'She was started on Phenobarbital immediately, and used what was called a ""bili blanket"" which is a small photo-therapy blanket until she grew out of it. 'Whenever she is unwell and whenever she has a sudden change in her mood such as getting upset at her brother or if she gets bullied then her skin tone changes drastically to a much more visible yellow until she calms herself back down. 'She also sleeps under a 4ft long bank of photo-therapy lights every single night, for at least 9 hours a night which typically keeps her skin tone fairly ‘normal’. 'The only thing you can really see is her yellow eyes - people ask us all the time ""why are your daughter’s eyes yellow?""' After being born Brianna underwent tests and was constantly in and out of the hospital for two weeks before finally being transferred to the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. She was eventually diagnosed with Crigler-Najjar syndrome at two-and-a-half weeks old and spent the best part of a month in hospital before being released. Photo-therapy has helped Brianna but it becomes less successful as she grows up so her dosage of phenobarbital must increase. The daily medication helps jump start . her liver but whenever the dosage is increased it causes her to feel . lethargic for weeks and constantly falls asleep at home and school as . well as leaving her feeling depressed. Light of life: The condition means she has dangerously high levels of bilirubin, a naturally occurring waste product from the blood usually broken down by an enzyme in the liver, that the UV rays help to lower . Temporary treatment: The treatment is known as photo-therapy but will have a lower success rate as her body becomes accustomed to it . Mr Minnich added: 'It’s difficult for her social life - having sleepovers at home is hard due to her lights and we have not allowed her stay at her friends house due to not having the lights. 'During the winter months it’s even harder since we don't have the bright sun to use to our advantage as the UV rays also act as a natural phototherapy light. 'Long term effects of the lights include having gallstones, so normally a Crigler-Najjar patient eventually has their gallbladder taken out. 'The lights are also very bright and will likely affect her eyes. The medication she takes is a barbiturate so taking it for the rest of her life is also going to cause problems. 'Her disorder will never go away, with the exception of getting a liver transplant. There have been talks of an experimental process called gene therapy, but it has been in the testing phase for years due to the lack of funds for research. 'While we were in the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia after she was born, my wife and I were both tested for compatibility, and it was determined that I would be a good donor. 'The process would take a portion of my liver and have it implanted into her body, which will than grow into her. Brave: Brianna, pictured with her brother Brenden, will eventually need a kidney transplant . Family photo: Brianna with her mother Brooke, father Bob and brother Brenden . 'The problem with the transplant is that she will still be taking anti-rejection pills the rest of her life and there are many risks in the transplant. 'We know families who have had the transplant, and in return, have had many problems and complications afterwards. We have been told that we would need to make a decision on the transplant by her pre-teens.' Brianna, who also lives with her mother Brooke, 28, and brother Brenden, six, hasn’t let her illness stop her from aiming high and one day hopes to become a famous television star. Mr Minnich said: 'Brianna loves to sing, play guitar and draw and has also been in multiple plays and dance performances for school - she is the typical ‘artsy’ type of young girl. 'On top of her creative mind she also likes playing softball and riding bikes. 'She asked us if we could put her in a six week modelling and acting class that she saw on television. Since the day she graduated she talks everyday about becoming famous and one day having her picture in a magazine or being on a hit Disney show. 'Although we haven’t yet heard anything from the agents office I tell her each day to never give up faith that maybe one day she’ll get her big break.'","Brianna Minnich, from Whitehall, Pennsylvania, has .

Alleged vigilantes have paint-bombed a car outside the home of Ian Brady’s confidante Jackie Powell, it was revealed today. Police were called to Brynhyfryd estate, south Wales, after white paint was splattered across the vehicle last Saturday morning. It is unclear whether the car belonged to Miss Powell, Brady’s mental health advocate for 13 years, and whether it was targeted by vigilantes because of her links to the serial killer. Paint-bombed: This car was vandalised while parked outside the house of Ian Brady's confidante Jackie Powell . Neighbours were shocked when they found the car covered in paint with a trail around it. Miss Powell’s next-door neighbour Julia Howells said: ‘I think it’s been a long time coming to be honest. ‘Obviously with my car being in the drive maybe it could be a target. 'Long time coming': While police would not confirm the owner of the vandalised car, one neighbour said: 'I think it's been a long time coming to be honest' ‘I really think the message is strong now, just go away please and don’t come back.’ Another neighbour said it happened during the night. Confidante: Miss Powell was serial killer Brady's mental health advocate for 13 years . She said: ‘I didn’t see anything but I woke up and the car was covered in paint. ‘It could have been anyone. We are a bit too close to it.’ Police were unable to confirm who owns the silver soft-top Renault but a spokeswoman said they were investigating. She said: ‘Dyfed-Powys Police are not able to confirm who the victim of crime is but we can confirm that a vehicle was damaged in the Brynhyfryd, Llangennech, area. ‘Inquiries to trace those responsible are now under way.’ Neighbour Wendy Williams said: ‘This was my concern originally because it was so publicised that something would happen. It’s awful.’ Miss Powell, who visited Brady frequently in jail since 1999, was arrested in September over a mystery letter handed to her by the child killer thought to contain the location of his only undiscovered victim. She was arrested on suspicion of preventing the lawful burial of a body after becoming embroiled in controversy following her participation in a Channel 4 documentary, Endgames Of A Psychopath. On camera, Miss Powell said Brady had given her a sealed envelope to be opened after his death, which would reveal the location of 12-year-old Keith Bennett’s body and ‘allow (Keith’s mother) Winnie Johnson to find peace’.

Moor, which overlooks Oldham. Keith was snatched off the street by Brady . and his girlfriend Myra Hindley as he walked to his grandmother's house . in Longsight, Manchester, on June 16, 1964. His mother Winnie Johnson dedicated her . life to finding her son's body, making several thousand trips to the .

Mrs Johnson wrote ‘hundreds’ of letters to Brady begging him to reveal where Keith’s body is buried before she died in August. Brady and Hindley lured children to their deaths in the 1960s, torturing them before burying their bodies on Saddleworth Moor, which overlooks Oldham. They were jailed for life in 1966 for the murders of Pauline Reade, 16, who disappeared on her way to a disco on July 12 1963; John Kilbride, 12, who was snatched in November the same year; Lesley Ann Downey, 10, who was lured away from a funfair on Boxing Day 1964, and Edward Evans, 17, who was axed to death in October 1965.","A car was paint-bombed outside the house of Jackie Powell .

Junior doctors dressing too casually for work - with some even wearing ripped jeans - is causing anxiety among older patients on NHS wards. At an inspection at Colchester General University Hospital Trust, some of the younger medics at Colchester General and Essex County hospitals were wearing inappropriate clothes. The British Medical Association’s guidelines on dress code are relatively relaxed, and medics are permitted to wear whatever they like, provided it will inspire confidence among the patients under their care. Smarten up: Some doctors at Colchester General hospital are wearing clothes that cause feelings of anxiety in their older patients as they are allowed to wear what they choose . Although doctors are not required to wear a uniform, they are required to cover any tattoos, wear little jewellery and tie their hair back. At the hospitals inspected, some doctors were seen outside the hospital in scrubs they had been wearing on the ward, which could increase the risk of infection to the more vulnerable. The report has been put to hospital bosses, who will decide whether to act on the findings when they meet this week, according to the Daily Telegraph. The inspection team are asking for a formal investigation, and for some, the relaxed dress code is a serious concern. Guidelines: The British Medical Association recommends doctors wear clothes that will inspire confidence in their patients at Essex County Hospital . ‘Some of the doctors are quite young and they sometimes wear jeans with holes and that type of thing,’ said Andy Patrick, chairman of the Patient and Environment Action Team. ‘When people come to hospital they expect standard to be good from the moment they arrive.’ Andrew Collier, vice-chairman of the junior doctors committee, believes the younger doctors have no need to smarten up, and said that a uniform could negatively affect the doctor-patient relationship. He said: ‘Many of my colleagues worry patients will see a doctor in uniform as just another corporate NHS body, rather than as the authoritative leader of the delivery of their care.’","Inspection at Colchester General and Essex County hospitals found junior doctors wearing unsuitable clothing .

In a critical climate indicator showing an ever warming world, the amount of ice in the Arctic Ocean has shrunk to an all time low. The shocking new figures reveal the ice has halved in size since the 1980s. 'We are now in uncharted territory,' said snow and ice data center director Mark Serreze. Scroll down for video . New images Nasa show reveal the full extent of Arctic ice shrinkage, showing a new record low compared to the average minimum extent over the past 30 years (in yellow). 'While we’ve long known that as the planet warms up, changes would be . seen first and be most pronounced in the Arctic, few of us . were prepared for how rapidly the changes would actually occur.' The ice cap at the North Pole measured 1.32 million square miles on Sunday, according to the new data released today. Scientists say this is 18 percent smaller than the previous record of 1.61 million square miles set in 2007, according to the National Snow and Ice Data Center in Boulder, Colo. Records go back to 1979 based on satellite tracking. 'On top of that, we're smashing a record that smashed a record,' said data center scientist Walt Meier. Sea ice shrank in 2007 to levels 22 percent below the previous record of 2005. Ice in the Arctic melts in summer and grows in winter, and it started growing again on Monday. In the 1980s, Meier said, summer sea ice would cover an area slightly smaller than the Lower 48 states. Now it is about half that. Man-made global warming has melted more sea ice and made it thinner over the last couple decades with it getting much more extreme this year, surprisingly so, . 'Recently the loss of summer ice has accelerated and the six lowest September ice extents have all been in the past six years,' Serreze said. 'I think that's quite remarkable.' Serreze said except for one strong storm that contributed to the ice loss, this summer melt was more from the steady effects of day-to-day global warming. Scattered ice floes are seen from the bridge of the RV Healy on August 20, 2012 northwest of Barrow, Alaska. The U.S. National Snow and Ice Data Center shows the amount of summer sea ice in the Arctic on Tuesday, Sept. 18, 2012, at center in white, and the 1979 to 2000 average extent for the day shown, with the orange line. But he and others say the polar regions are where the globe first sees the signs of climate change. 'Arctic sea ice is one of the most sensitive of nature's thermometers,' said Jason Box, an Ohio State University polar researcher. What happens in the Arctic changes climate all over the rest of the world, scientists have reported in studies. The ice in the Arctic 'essentially acts like an air conditioner by keeping things cooler,' Meier said. 'And when sea ice melts more, it's like the air conditioner isn't running efficiently,' he said. Sea ice reflects more than 90 percent of the sun's heat off the Earth, but when it is replaced by the darker open ocean, more than half of the heat is absorbed into the water, Meier said. Scientists at the snow and ice data center said their computer models show an Arctic that would be essentially free of ice in the summer by 2050, but they add that current trends show ice melting faster than the computers are predicting. 'Climate models have predicted a retreat of the Arctic sea ice; but the actual retreat has proven to be much more rapid than the predictions,' said Claire Parkinson, a climate scientist at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, Md. 'There continues to be considerable inter-annual variability in the sea ice cover, but the long-term retreat is quite apparent.' The thickness of the ice cover is also in decline. 'The core of the ice cap is the perennial ice, which normally survived the summer because it was so thick', said Joey Comiso, senior scientist with NASA Goddard. 'But because it's been thinning year after year, it has now become vulnerable to melt.' The disappearing older ice gets replaced in winter with thinner seasonal ice that usually melts completely in the summer. This year, a powerful cyclone formed off the coast of Alaska and moved on Aug. 5 to the center of the Arctic Ocean, where it churned the weakened ice cover for several days. The storm cut off a large section of sea ice north of the Chukchi Sea and pushed it south to warmer waters that made it melt entirely. It also broke vast extensions of ice into smaller pieces more likely to melt.'The storm definitely seems to have played a role in this year's unusually large retreat of the ice"", Parkinson said. 'But that exact same storm, had it occurred decades ago when the ice was thicker and more extensive, likely wouldn't have had as prominent an impact, because the ice wasn't as vulnerable then as it is now.'","Ice cap at the North Pole measured just 1.32 million square miles on Sunday .

A killer who stabbed his girlfriend's stepfather in front of his victim's family has been jailed for 11 years. Nicolas Warrender thrust a steak knife into 'unarmed and unsuspecting' Kevin Gaunt’s heart during the confrontation in June, after he mistakenly believed the 52-year-old had assaulted Hannah Gaunt, Newcastle Crown Court heard. Mr Gaunt, a grandfather, staggered into his kitchen and collapsed in a pool of blood on the floor as his distraught wife Carole begged 'don't leave me, please don’t leave me'. As her husband lay dying Mrs Gaunt was frantically trying to keep her four-year-old granddaughter, who she had been babysitting, away from the horror happening inside the house while calling for help. Warrender (left) turned up on Kevin Gaunt's (right) doorstep after he had been drinking with his girlfriend and stuck a knife into the popular man's heart . Warrender, 23, of Houghton-le-Spring, Tyne and Wear, denied murder and was tried by a jury at Newcastle Crown Court. He claimed a knife he had been using to cut an apple had accidentally caused the fatal wound on Father's Day as he fended off an attack by Mr Gaunt. But prosecutor Robert Woodcock QC told the court how Warrender had 'armed himself' with the blade after he had been out drinking with his victim's stepdaughter Hannah, 20. On the night of the killing, the . couple had been out drinking while Mr Gaunt and his wife looked after . Hannah’s little girl at their home next door. After the night out a row erupted and Hannah was ordered out of her mother and step father’s home. She went back to her own house and Mr . and Mrs Gaunt locked their door for the night but moments later . Warrender turned up to confront his girlfriend’s step father. Mr Woodcock said: 'There clearly was some kind of scuffle between them. 'The result of it was that Kevin Gaunt was fatally wounded with one stab wound to the chest. 'The wound, say the prosecution, was . caused by the defendant Nicolas Warrender, in his misguided belief that . Hannah had been assaulted by Kevin Gaunt. Newcastle Crown Court heard how the 23-year-old had confronted the unarmed, popular grandfather . 'Before he went around to have it out . with Kevin Gaunt he had armed himself with a knife, a steak knife from a . block in Hannah’s kitchen, a weapon, say the prosecution, which he had . concealed, of which, say the prosecution, Kevin Gaunt almost certainly . never had sight of at all.' After more than five hours deliberation jurors rejected Warrender’s claim that what happened had been a complete accident while protecting himself and found him guilty of manslaughter yesterday. He was found not guilty of the charge of murder. Judge James Goss QC told him: 'You armed yourself with a sharp steak knife with a blade of over four inches and in the ensuing confrontation you stabbed Kevin Gaunt through the heart. 'I am quite satisfied you took the knife with you at least prepared to use it as a weapon if the need arose. 'You were significantly under the influence of alcohol, two-and-a-half to three times the limit for driving a vehicle. 'The offence was committed virtually on the victim’s doorstep to his home, in the presence of his wife and his wife’s granddaughter, a child who was clearly deeply upset by what took place. 'You have never acknowledged your crime and there can be no credit for guilty plea or remorse.' Toby Hedworth QC, defending while Warrender does have previous convictions for violence he has been out of trouble for over four years and has no history of carrying weapons. The grieving family of Kevin Gaunt has been left devastated by the death of the devoted dad and grandad. He left behind four children of his own as well as grandchildren. Speaking on behalf of the family, cousin Jason Gaunt, 38, said: 'Warrender has destroyed this family. We will never get over this. 'Kevin was a big strong man who loved his family. 'The conviction gives us some relief, although whatever happened in court can never bring him back or come anywhere close to stopping our pain. 'At least the conviction means there is one less person on the streets using a knife to sort out a row.' Mr Gaunt’s family said the hundreds of people who turned out to pay their respects at his funeral showed how popular and well thought of he was by so many. Mr Gaunt’s cousin Kay Thompson, 44, said: 'He would do anything for anybody, if you wanted anything done you just asked Kevin. 'As soon as you said you needed something it was done, it was never too much trouble for him, nothing was. 'He was always up for a laugh and was so popular and well known in the area.'","Nicholas Warrender mistakenly thought his girlfriend had been assaulted by her stepfather Kevin Gaunt .

Creative genius: Padraic Fallon has died aged 66 after a long battle with cancer . Padraic Fallon, a creative genius who transformed financial publishing in the UK, has died. The death of Mr Fallon, 66, after a long battle with cancer will be felt by all those who knew him in the financial world and beyond. He turned the magazine Euromoney into a City ‘bible’ and a FTSE250 company with a market value of just under £1billion and a turnover of £363million a year. The empire he built spanned 100 specialist magazines in finance, aviation, pharmaceuticals and law. The titles became must-reads for bankers, lawyers and financial analysts across the globe. In recent times Mr Fallon and his team smartly embraced the digital revolution and developed what has become known as ‘data mining’, websites with unique access to business information. His passing followed a year-long fight against cancer. With typical foresight he made sure that a proper succession structure was in place so the work he had done on increasing the reach of Euromoney to every corner of the world could continue. Richard Ensor, his successor as chairman of Euromoney, said: ‘Padraic was a terrific colleague and author of what we have come to call the Euromoney style. ‘He was always concerned that proper English was used in everything that was published. He is going to be an enormous loss.’ 'Terrific colleague': Padraic Fallon (right) listens to speeches at a Euromoney conference in Beijing in 2006 . Tribute: The Euromoney website reports Mr Fallon's death. The businessman made sure that a proper succession structure was in place at the company . Patrick Sergeant, who founded Euromoney . in 1969 and was City editor of the Daily Mail, asked Mr Fallon to move . from the Mail to Euromoney to become editor in 1974. He said: ‘Apart from starting the magazine in 1969, it was the best thing I ever did for Euromoney.’ Mr Fallon skilfully managed to make the transition from financial journalism at the Mail to running a business, a rare achievement. He rose to managing director  of Euromoney Institutional Investor in 1985 and became its chairman in 1992. Foresight: Mr Fallon and his team smartly embraced the digital revolution and developed websites with unique access to business information . He was also a director of DMGT, publishers of the Daily Mail, and holder of a 68 per cent stake in the media empire he ran. Padraic Fallon was born in Ireland, one of six sons of the Irish poet of the same name famed for his radio plays including Diarmuid and Grainne. He was educated at St Peter’s College, Wexford, and Blackrock College before going on to Trinity College, Dublin, where he earned an honours degree in Business Studies and an MA. Mr Fallon began his journalism career at Thomson Newspapers, moving on to the Mirror and then the City pages of the Mail. At . heart he was always a journalist, a stickler for good writing and . author of the Euromoney style guide, which provided a model for . generations of reporters. His . own contribution to business writing was recognised when he won a . Wincott Special Award for outstanding financial journalism in 1981, an . achievement of which he was immensely proud. Mr . Fallon’s writing was not confined to journalism and he produced two . literary volumes in later life, A Hymn of the Dawn in 2003 and The . Circles of Archimedes, published in 2009. Colleagues . recall with affection his cigar-chomping company and conversations, in . which he would switch freely from business to Irish poetry. Mr Fallon . was an enthusiastic fly fisherman and shooter. He also liked to play tennis even though his skills were, as one friend put it, ‘less developed’. For many years his favourite eaterie . was the Savoy Grill, but after the legendary restaurant fell under the . control of Gordon Ramsay he preferred to give it a miss. Published: Mr Fallon’s writing was not confined to journalism and he produced two literary volumes in later life, A Hymn of the Dawn (left) in 2003 and The Circles of Archimedes (right) in 2009 . A hard-working manager, Mr Fallon never lost his love for journalism, for free markets or the financial world, although his beliefs were sorely tested after the failure of Lehman Brothers in 2008. But Mr Fallon, Euromoney and its offshoots bounced back and remain the bible of the bankers. At last week’s International Monetary Fund meetings in Tokyo, bankers seized on the latest edition of Euromoney with enthusiasm. In the best traditions of the reporting he helped pioneer, a small team produced a series of scoops for the daily journal of IMF meetings, Emerging Markets – a title fittingly owned by Euromoney.

Problems: Former police officer David Slinn, 59, drove his Jaguar to court while drunk to answer a string of drink driving charges. He has been spared jail after a judge said he would not be 'comfortable' in prison . A former police officer who drove his Jaguar to court while drunk to answer a string of drink driving charges has been spared jail after a judge said he would not be 'comfortable' in prison. David Slinn, 59, was due to appear at court after officers found him asleep in his £30,000 car on his driveway with a bottle of gin on the front passenger seat. When Slinn appeared at North Staffordshire Magistrates’ Court on September 4, officers smelt alcohol on his breath and CCTV footage revealed he had driven into the car park while drunk. A breath test showed he was almost twice the legal limit and he was arrested again on suspicion of drink driving. Slinn - an officer with Staffordshire Police until he retired in 1999 - admitted the charge when he appeared at court on Wednesday. He was given a five-year driving ban and handed an 18-week prison sentence suspended for two years after the magistrates were told his role in the force would make it 'uncomfortable' for him in jail. He was also placed under supervision for two years and ordered to attend a drink drivers’ programme. Clair Moss, prosecuting, told the court: 'He was unsteady on his feet and smelled of alcohol. CCTV footage was viewed and he had driven to court on his own.' Slinn was first arrested when police investigating a report of drink driving found him asleep with a bottle of gin in his car on the drive of his home in Cheadle, Staffordshire, on June 28. He refused to have a breathalyser test and was charged with failing to provide a specimen for analysis. Less than a month later, he was again caught at the wheel of his car after going on a pub crawl and a breathalyser test revealed he was more than twice the drink drive limit. When he was questioned by officers he told them he had an empty bottle of gin in the car which he was taking for recycling. Drunk: The former police officer was due to appear at court after officers found him asleep in his £30,000 Jaguar car on his driveway with a bottle of gin on the front passenger seat. This is a file picture of a Jaguar . He appeared again at court for all three offences and admitted failing to provide a specimen, drink-driving and being drunk in charge of a vehicle. Tony Cooke, defending, said: 'This is unfortunate. He came to court, he was aware he might lose his licence. 'The police officer thought he looked a bit unsteady on his feet. The decision was made to check if he had driven. 'He had. He was not aware he was over the limit. He was drinking the night before. 'This is not a sinister, deliberate attempt to thumb his nose at court. 'This is a gentleman who has been used to serving the public in the past. Someone with that background would not be comfortable in prison. Worrying: When Slinn appeared at North Staffordshire Magistrates' Court, pictured, last month officers smelt alcohol on his breath and CCTV footage revealed he had driven into the car park while drunk . 'He is starting to realise there is a problem and he needs help.' In a victim impact statement, Slinn’s daughter Lauren said: 'Since his arrest, his verbal abuse on a daily basis has been emotionally draining. 'After the arrest he continued to drink. My sister died in a road accident, not drink-related, and I can’t understand why he would want to do this.' Mark Judson, chairman of the Staffordshire branch of the National Association of Retired Police Officers, said: 'I wouldn’t say drink was a particular problem with the police, or retired police, it’s a problem in general society. 'Let’s hope he can get the help he needs to put him back on the straight and narrow. History would show it’s a pretty bleak future if he doesn’t.'","David Slinn, 59, was due to appear at .

At an Essex nursery, the plants spoken to in a Geordie accent grew almost 10 per cent than the others . Then, he and his staff started to speak to the plants in a variety of accents. Appropriate TV programmes and songs were also played. For . instance, the plants in the Newcastle group were spoken to in a Geordie . accent and played songs by Cheryl Cole and Ant & Dec. Episodes . of Coronation Street gave a taste of Manchester, Desperate Housewives . and Brookside were used for Liverpool voices and the TV show The Only . Way Is Chelsea provided upper-class tones. In all, eight UK accents were tried, plus American and Australian ones. Class barrier: Episodes of Made in Chelsea (cast pictured) were used for upper-class tones and the plants on the receiving end seemed to struggle . But it was the Newcastle accent that triumphed, with these plants growing almost 10 per cent more than some others. Mr Bonnett, who runs the Gardening Express website, said: 'It's long been thought that plants thrive if you talk to them so we decided to find out once and for all which dialects they respond to best. 'After just a few weeks we started to see differences emerging with the Geordie and Welsh groups shooting up while the Chelsea and Mancunian plants seemed to particularly struggle. 'We kept all other variables as constant as possible. So the plants all had the same amount of sunlight, water and nutrients. 'By the end of the summer it was clear that the accents had a huge effect. There was, more or less, average growth across the Australian, Liverpudlian, Yorkshire and American groups. 'The Geordie and Welsh groups visibly thrived and displayed enhanced growth while the Scottish, Chelsea and Mancunian plants were stunted.'","Plants spoken to in a Geordie accent grew 10 per cent more than others .

Speaking on ITV's This Morning about her . family experience, Caroline Robinson, 49, left, said she was abused by her . great-uncle aged 12 and revealed that her family knew and tried to protect Savile's fame . She said she refused to confront her brother because she knew that if the DJ were brought to book, the . comfortable lifestyle he provided for her would end. She said: 'If we blabbed on Jimmy . or told tales, the fame that surrounded him would've gone. And I loved . to say that Jimmy Savile is my Uncle - I loved to say it, it made me . proud. 'But for him to suddenly be destroyed over something like this, . the family would have had nothing.' She said Savile had 'bought her silence' and always looked after her, sending her on holidays, buying her a . cottage, and put her up in a BUPA sheltered home. After the star died last year, aged 84, an auction of his collection of mementos . and personal belongings - including his Rolls-Royce which went for . £130,000 and the original red Jim'll Fix It chair for £8,500 - raised . about £320,000 for his charities. Some of his properties are still to be sold but the proceeds will be given to charity.

Caroline Robinson, pictured when she was younger, has recalled how Savile got excited when she sat on him . Ms Robinson recounted the full horror . of how Savile abused her to Philip Schofield and Holly Willoughby, . explaining how he had called her over and asked her to sit on his knee.

'And he talked to me and he'd . lower the tone of his voice, so the more quiet he got the more I had to . lean in to hear him. And then I thought there's something wrong here... and he was stroking my back, caressing up and down my spine, and it . didn't feel right. It felt weird.' Ms Robinson, now happily married to . second husband David, said she remembers having a short skirt on and as . she didn't want to spoil her best dress, she lifted her skirt up so she . was sat on him with just her knickers. She recalled: 'The more he rubbed he hand up and down my back and went closer . towards my pants, I thought something's hard here... something's . uncomfortable, what am I sat on? Car keys?... 'So the more I wiggled, the . more excited Jimmy got. And the next minute I knew, he had his hand on my . bum, he'd gone into my knickers and his hand was on my bum.' She added: 'This was in a room full of people. Nobody saw - he got it down to perfection.' Ms Robinson said she made an excuse that she needed to go to the toilet and ran off. She said: 'I'd like, wet myself. I know it's sounds a but rude, but it was like I'd wet myself. So I had to go to the toilet and I jumped up and I went out and I just cried. I just couldn't believe it. It was strange. I told my grandma... Jimmy's elder sister, who was sat opposite.'

A study has shown attractive women are more likely to be seen as guilty of murder . Women charged with murder who plead self defence are more likely to be perceived as guilty if have 'thick lips' and 'smooth and harmonious facial features', says a study. The findings made by a team from the University of Grenada, Spain, contradict the generally held stereotype that beauty deflects criminal responsibility. They found that in the case of a woman claiming self defence in the killing of an abusive husband, police officers were more likely to regard as innocent defendants who were described as unattractive. The findings also showed that women perceived as more independent and in charge of their lives were also more likely to be seen as guilty of murder. Legal processes are ideally conducted without bias, but in reality biases influence all human judgements and looking at how these prejudices shape behaviour should help to minimise their effect. In the past, social psychology has widely accepted the contention that beautiful people are less likely to be regarded as criminally responsible. As the study's authors put it: 'Attractive people are often perceived as having positive personality features and attributes in consonance with the implicit theory that ""beauty is goodness"".' This 'halo effect' has also been previously shown to influence perception of other traits, with attractive people seen as 'more sociable, friendly, warm, competent and intelligent than unattractive individuals.' To test this effect in the scenario of domestic violence, the Grenada team created fictitious scenarios in which a woman was accused of stabbing her husband to death as he lay in bed. In each case, the woman's story was that she had been the victim of years of domestic violence and had finally killed her husband out of self defence. The only difference between narratives was the defendant's description. In one story she was described with features typically regarded as beautiful: 'María is an attractive woman with thick lips; smooth, harmonious facial features; straight blonde hair; and a slender and elegant appearance.' In the other story she was described as 'unattractive': 'María is an unattractive woman with thin lips, stern and jarring facial features, dark bundled hair, and is neither slender nor elegant in appearance.' The other variable, which the researchers evaluated separately from the defendant's physical attractiveness, was her likeness to the 'prototype of a battered woman'. In some of the stories: 'María is a 36-year old housewife with two children (six and three years old) who has been married for 10 years. María wears sunglasses that hide her face, has poor personal appearance and dress, and is timid in answering the judge or lawyers' questions.' While in the others: 'María is a financial consultant of a leading company; she has no children, and has been married for ten years. María is a well-dressed fashion-conscious woman, calm and resolute in her interactions with the judge and lawyers.' The researchers then showed 169 police officers from the Spanish national and local police forces one of the stories each and had them give their personal judgement on the defendant's guilt. The original femme fatale: Barbara Stanwyck with Fred MacMurray in the 1944 noir classic Double Indemnity, in which she plays a woman who convinces an insurance investigator to help her murder her husband . The results were surprising. Contrary . to the hypothesis that the attractive defendant would 'receive a more . benevolent appraisal of criminality' it was found that the 'unattractive women defendants were attributed less criminal responsibility.' Women are twice as likely as men to use emoticons in text messages, according to a new study from Rice University. The symbols, which began as happy and sad smiling faces but have since morphed into dozens of expressions, have become hugely popular in text messages and email. The new study used smartphone data from men and women over six months and analysed 124,000 text messages. The participants were given free iPhones to use for the test period but didn’t know what researchers were investigating. The team says the study was unique. 'We believe that our study represents the first naturalistic and longitudinal study that collects real emoticon use from text messages ""in the wild"",' said Philip Kortum, assistant professor of psychology at Rice and one of the study’s authors. The researchers were less surprised to find, however, that the defendant who did not fit the stereotype of a battered woman was more likely to be regarded as guilty. She was perceived as having 'more control over the situation, which in legal terms can translate as a higher degree of guilt', the researchers said. The study's authors say their research has important implications for the way police officers are trained to deal with domestic violence. 'These findings and interpretation have been systematically reported in the literature i.e., people who behave atypically and violate the expectations of others are perceived as having greater intentionality as their behaviour is judged be the result of their own free will,' 'These findings and interpretation have been systematically reported in the literature i.e., people who behave atypically and violate the expectations of others are perceived as having greater intentionality as their . behaviour is judged be the result of their own free will.'

Mitt Romney expressed understandable concern following the dramatic emergency landing of his wife Ann's plane due to a fire on board -  before offering a surprising solution to the problem. The Republican presidential candidate told a fundraiser in Beverly Hills at the weekend that the fundamental design of airplanes was flawed for dealing with such emergencies. Romney said: 'When you have a fire in an aircraft, . there’s no place to go, exactly, there’s no - and you can’t find any . oxygen from outside the aircraft to get in the aircraft, because the . windows don’t open. Plane stupid? Mitt Romney told a fundraiser in Beverly Hills that it was 'very dangerous' that the windows didn't open on his wife's plane during an electrical fire . 'I don’t know why they don’t do that. It’s a real . problem. So it’s very dangerous.' The bizarre grasp of aviation did not appear to be a joke, as Romney also told the Los Angeles Times that he was extremely concerned about his wife's safety. He also said: 'I appreciate the fact that she is on the ground, safe and sound. And I don’t think she knows just how worried some of us were.' According to aviation experts, opening a plane window would have flooded the cabin with oxygen, fueled the fire and caused a loss of cabin pressure that could have ripped apart the fuselage. The presidential candidate was widely mocked for his remarks. The Daily Kos wrote: 'Yeah, great question Mitt. I mean, wouldn't it be awesome to be able to crack the window when you're at 35,000 feet? You know, get a taste of that 500+ mile per hour breeze?' Emergency: Ann Romney, pictured on the campaign plane in August, had a dramatic landing on Friday after her aircraft caught fire . On the scene: The Romney campaign tweeted their thanks to fire crews who rushed to help them following the emergency landing in Denver . Meanwhile MSNBC's Rachel Maddo wsaid : 'It's a real problem that the windows don't roll down on . airplanes? Is it also a problem that guns don't shoot backwards through . the barrel this way?' Mrs Romney's plane made a dramatic emergency landing on Friday afternoon after an electrical fire broke out on board. Smoke filled the cabin of the aircraft on its way to Los Angeles forcing the pilot to ground the plane unexpectedly in Colorado. Ann Romney and other passengers on the flight were unharmed in the incident. In a recorded conversation between the plane and the airport's flight tower, a man's voice can be heard saying: 'We have an electrical issue here and we’re going to declare an emergency.' 'Safe and sound': Romney expressed relief that his wife Ann was unharmed after her plane made an emergency landing en route to a political fundraiser . 'We’ll probably need assistance here,' the man, presumably the pilot, added, before explaining 'we got smoke in the cabin'. Mrs Romney's flight was at 40,000 feet when it turned around to make the emergency landing. Passengers were instructed by crew members to put their seat belts on during the grounding. Romney spokesman Sarah Haley, who was on the aircraft with Mrs Romney, said the plane, a Canadair CL-60 regional jet, was surrounded by fire trucks when it landed at the airport. Romney's fundraiser in California raked in $6million in for the campaign coffers with 1,500 supporters paying $50,000 to hear Romney speak at the Beverly Hilton Hotel. Romney's press office did not immediately have a comment for MailOnline.","Republican candidate told LA fundraiser it was 'very dangerous' that aircraft windows didn't open .

Nicky Moore, 42, was rushed to Royal Bournemouth Hospital with stomach pains but she was told she had gastroenteritis, given painkillers and discharged at 3am. Ms Moore had no car or money on her and her husband, Roger, was at home with the couple's children so couldn't collect her. When the hospital refused to drop her because they had no vehicles, she walked the four miles home in her pyjamas and dressing gown and in severe pain. Long walk home: Nicky Moore, pictured, was forced to walk four miles home from hospital in her dressing gown after being wrongly misdiagnosed and discharged at 3am . Later that day her pain got worse and she was readmitted to the same hospital where an ultrasound scan revealed she actually had gallstones. She stayed in the Dorset hospital for six days and is now on an emergency waiting list to have her gallbladder removed.

'I was in shock as I set off and kept having to stop to take shelter from the rain and because I was in pain. 'Several police cars passed me but, even though I was in my dressing gown, no one pulled up to help. She said that by the time she reached Christchurch the street lights had been switched off and the couple's estate was in darkness. 'I could have been attacked or collapsed and died from exposure,' Ms Moore said.

When the newly-appointed chief of the CIA offers to marry you in exchange to help him cash a few pay cheques he earned from the recent campaign that toppled the Gaddafi regime, who wouldn't jump at the chance? One Taiwanese engineer grasped the opportunity with both hands and as well as wiring her 'fiancé' $30,000, she also managed to get herself arrested. Liu Hsu-jen claims she was contacted by a man claiming to be the newly sworn-in Director of the Central Intelligence Agency David Petraeus on the Internet four months ago. Marriage?: General David Patraeus, who was sworn in as CIA chief on September 6, is said to have been impersonated in a Skype scam . The married general asked for the engineer's hand, vowing to marry her, 'even if it will start World War III'. He then promised that he would fly to Taipei to fetch his new bride on a U.S. military plane and bring her back to the U.S. All she had to do was wire him the $30,000 to help for fuel expenses. He then sent her a wedding ring and 37 Citibank travellers' cheques worth 500 euros each, which he said he received from 'the recent campaign that toppled the Col Gaddafi of Libya' - even though the U.S. was not largely involved in the military campaigns in Libya. And also the small matter that General Petraeus is married. Scam: Thumbs up for marriage . When Miss Hsu-jen went to cash the cheques it emerged they were forgeries and she was promptly arrested. She explained to authorities that they had come from her fiancé David Howell Petraeus and that though she had her doubts at the beginning of their 'relationship' she was assured of his validity after an online video conference with him. According to The China Post, footage of the web conferences showed a . man with a striking resemblance to Petraeus. Miss Hsu-jen - who at this time already resigned from her post as a managing engineer at Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company - said she then googled her fiancé and was confident that he was who he said he was and so wired the money. Gawker reported that there was a Skype scam doing the rounds where people had been contacted by a man pretending to be General Petraeus and asking them to send money or help him collect a parcel. But despite the authorities and media telling the engineer that she was part of a scam, she refused to believe it and still insists that the love between her and the CIA boss is real. 'How could a scamming group have so much resources at its disposal?” she asked, adding that the man who claimed to be Petraeus was deliberately misleading the media into believing he was a scammer to keep cross-strait issues calm and 'protect their love', according to the Taipei Times. She also said that if CNN interviewed her, it would force her fiancé to 'come to Taiwan sooner'. Police in Hsinchu sent several officers to visit Miss Hsu-jen to try to persuade her that she was the victim of an international scam and that the man’s professed 'love' was in fact a way of conning her out of her savings. However she refused to believe it and is currently trying to raise money on Facebook so that her 'true love' can come to Tapei to get her as promised. She is currently out on bail.","Other Skype users report they have been contacted by someone claiming to be the newly-appointed CIA boss .

A student has almost died after being given an 'alcohol enema' at a college fraternity house. Alexander Broughton, 20, was rushed to hospital unconscious after a rubber tube was inserted into his rectum and alcohol poured in. The practice, known among students as 'butt chugging', took place during a party at  the Pi Kappa Alpha House on the grounds of the University of Tennessee. Brink of death: Alexander Broughton, 20, was given an 'alcohol enema' during a frat party at the University of Tennessee . Using the enema speeds up the process of alcohol entering the blood stream because it bypasses the liver's filters. The 20-year-old was found to have a dangerously-high blood alcohol level of 'well over' 0.4. Hospital staff treating the unconscious student at first thought he was the victim of a sexual assault when they examined his body. They later discovered from his friends that he had been given the crude alcohol enema at the frat house in Knoxville. Doctors at the UT Medical Center said the student had ingested so much alcohol he could have died from alcohol poisoning. Dangerous partying: The 'enema' causes alcohol to enter the bloodstream faster as it bypasses the liver . Investigators who later went to the frat house found three other students passed out in their rooms from drinking. They also found boxes of empty boxes of wine strewn around the Pi Kappa Alpha House. University officials have now suspended the Pi Kappa Alpha fraternity while police investigate the drinking party. Broughton, who is from Memphis, was taken to hospital by a friend in the early hours of Saturday morning, according to a police report. The student appeared to be 'extremely intoxicated and showed signs of physical and possible sexual assault'. He was transferred to the hospital's critical care unit after his blood alcohol reading was put at 'well over' 0.4. Frat boys: The PIKE chapter at the university campus in Knoxville has been in trouble in the past for hazing . Broughton was discharged from the hospital on Monday. Police discovered that the 20-year-old and others at the frat house had been taking part in 'butt chugging'. Irresponsible: Police found empty boxes of wine strewn around the frat house . Police spokesman Darrell DeBusk said: 'Upon extensive questioning it is believed that members of the fraternity were using rubber tubing inserted into their rectums as a conduit for alcohol as the abundance of capillaries and blood vessels present greatly heightens the level and speed of the alcohol entering the blood stream as it bypasses the filtering by the liver.' A spokesman for the University of Tennessee said: 'University officials are currently conducting an investigation into allegations involving the Pi Kappa Alpha fraternity chapter and incidents that occurred over the weekend. 'Due to the gravity of the allegations, interim sanctions have already been imposed upon the chapter and will remain in effect until the investigation is concluded and final reports are available.' It is not the first time the PIKE chapter has been involved in trouble at the university. In 2008, the chapter was placed on administrative suspension after a hazing incident where pledges were allegedly asked to do push-ups on broken glass. Three students were later hospitalized with staph infections. A member of the fraternity said pledges were asked perform a 'lateral ab movement' known as 'bows and toes' on the bathroom floor. The university's Office of Student Judicial Affairs charged the chapter with hazing and it pleaded guilty. After completing its suspension, the chapter served several months of probation. The international PIKE organization investigated and kicked out 25 of the chapter's active members.","Alexander Broughton, 20, was brought to hospital unconscious .

Kaylee Davidson-Olley made medical history when she had the transplant aged just four months on October 14, 1987 at the Freeman Hospital, Newcastle. Since then 112 children in the UK under the age have received new hearts. Miss Davidson-Olley said: ‘I can’t believe I am fit and healthy 25 years after my heart transplant. I feel overwhelmed, excited and very emotional. Kaylee Davidson-Olley, pictured with her mother Carol, has celebrated her 25th anniversary of becoming the UK's first ever successful baby heart transplant. She was just four months old when the had the operation at the Freeman Hospital, Newcastle. ‘This was only made possible because of the generosity of a family who made that important decision about organ donation, a decision that saved my life. Without that family discussing organ donation, I simply wouldn’t be here.’ The 25-year-old balances studying at college with a busy athletics schedule, has just been picked to represent Great Britain at the World Transplant Games in Durban, South Africa in July next year. She added: ‘I hope that my own story and that of all the children at this special event will encourage others to be involved, if only to just talk about organ donation with their family.’ This week there are six babies on the organ donor register awaiting new hearts and two children have already died this year whilst waiting for organs. At the 25th anniversary of the first successful baby heart transplant held today, Miss Davidson-Olley was joined by medical experts from around the world and more than 30 people who since have had the operation as babies. Dr Richard Kirk, a consultant paediatric cardiologist at Freeman Hospital, said: ‘The 25th anniversary of Kaylee’s operation is a celebration of both her life, the skills of the medical team who have looked after her and Kaylee and her family’s determination to make the most of the gift of life from her donor.

Miss Davidson-Olley’s mother Carol said: ‘We were in the right place at the right time 25 years ago, and will forever be grateful to the medical team who saved her life and also to the donor family. ‘Kaylee is an amazing and inspirational young woman. She has spent her life campaigning so that others can have the same opportunity as her - the gift of life itself.' Anthony Clarkson, assistant director for organ donation with NHS Blood and Transplant, said: 'It is great that due to transplants, many people are alive today. ‘However these life-saving operations are only possible thanks to the generosity of donor families. 'There are 10,000 people currently in need of a transplant, with 177 people waiting for a heart. Three people die every day waiting for an organ, so we need people to sign up to the Organ Donor Register and tell their family their wishes so more lives can be saved.'

"By . Kirsty Walker . UPDATED: . 19:51 EST, 22 January 2012 . Chris Huhne’s hopes of staying in the Cabinet if he is charged over speeding allegations appeared to be crushed by Nick Clegg yesterday. The Deputy Prime Minister warned it would be a ‘very serious issue’ if the Crown Prosecution Service charged Mr Huhne over claims he asked  ex-wife Vicky Pryce to take speeding points for him. Mr Huhne could be charged with perverting the course of justice as early as this week after police won a court battle to gain access to explosive emails sent by Miss Pryce. Allies of the Energy Secretary have indicated he may make an astonishing attempt to cling to his job if he was charged. Lib Dem colleagues: Chris Huhne and Nick Clegg . Just around the corner: A decision on the court battle between Chris Huhne, left, and his former wife Vicky Pryce, right, is expected within days . Third party: Constance Briscoe revealed that she had given information to the police in relation to the speeding offence allegation . Describing his mood as ‘bullish and . confident’, one pointed out that the ministerial code did not require . ministers to step down automatically if they were a defendant in a . criminal case – only that government lawyers must be consulted. However, Mr Clegg made it clear that . the Government would want to be seen to uphold the ‘highest standards of . probity’ among ministers. Significantly, he also appeared to open the . door to a return to government for David Laws if Mr Huhne was forced to . quit. Mr Laws was considered a rising star . until he was found guilty of breaching expenses rules. He was one of the . Lib Dem negotiators who hammered out the coalition deal with the . Conservatives then joined the cabinet as Chief Secretary to the Treasury . – Chancellor George Osborne’s right-hand man. Mr Clegg said: ‘We as a . Government want the highest standards of probity to be in place in . everything that is done by Cabinet members.’ When asked about Mr Laws, he said: ‘I . would like to see David Laws back in government – not just because I . admire him a lot and he is a close colleague and friend of mine. ‘I just so happen to think he would . be very good for the Government and good for Britain. In my view, he’s . got one of the most sophisticated minds in British politics.’ New love: Chris Huhne with Carina Trimingham - he left his wife of 25 years for her . The way was cleared for a swift . ruling on the case after the publishers of The Sunday Times dropped a . High Court challenge to a court order requiring emails relating to the . allegations to be produced to Essex Police. Sources say the messages implicate . the embattled minister, who has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing. In an . unusual step, the Director of Public Prosecutions, Keir Starmer, said . the CPS was ‘very close’ to making a decision, with the emails being the . final piece of the puzzle. It yesterday emerged that evidence . from part-time judge Constance Briscoe will play a key role in the CPS . decision. Respected economist Miss Pryce is reported to have confided in . the judge, who is a family friend, that Mr Huhne asked her to say she . was at the wheel of the car when it broke the speed limit in 2003. Miss . Briscoe last year said she remembered the conversation during which she . advised Miss Pryce to tell Mr Huhne to ‘go away and come clean’. The Huhnes’ 25-year marriage broke down in June 2010 when Mr Huhne left his wife for former aide Carina Trimingham. If the speeding allegations are . proved, Mr Huhne could be found guilty of perverting the course of . justice, and jailed for up to six months. Detectives are said to believe . Miss Pryce should also be charged with attempting to pervert the course . of justice. A friend of Mr Huhne’s said: ‘He’s characteristically . bullish and confident. Vicky barely uses emails. It’s the least . important bit of the evidence.’ Meanwhile, Mr Clegg yesterday insisted that . state-owned Royal Bank of Scotland will not be allowed to lavish bumper . bonuses – from a pool estimated at £500million – on its bankers. Hundreds of traders and investment . bankers who were bailed out by taxpayers are expected to share in a . total pot of about £2.5billion – an average of nearly £140,000 each. But Mr Clegg said: ‘We have been . very, very clear that in RBS – and for that matter, in other banks – the . bonus pool has got to be considerably lower than it was last year.’","Long-term friend of Vicky Pryce interviewed by detectives over penalty points row .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 18:07 EST, 2 October 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 20:54 EST, 2 October 2012 . President Barack Obama has ordered the CIA and the Pentagon to hunt down the terrorists who attacked the US consulate in Libya. It's unclear what the president plans to do once the perpetrators of . the September 11 assault in Benghazi are found, but he has mobilized the . military's Joint Special Operations Command to help carry out the . mission. JSOC and the CIA teamed up to send Navy SEAL commandos into Pakistan in 2011 for a raid that killed Osama bin Laden. The White House plans for retaliation come after it was revealed that security officials missed key signs that the consulate and US Ambassador Chris Stevens were in danger. Scroll down for video . Deadly attack: The consulate, located in the city of Benghazi, was reportedly bombed twice in the months leading up to the attack, which occurred on the 11th anniversary of the September 11 terror attacks . Stevens, a member of the foreign . service and two former Navy SEAL bodyguards were killed after terrorists . overran the consulate and set fire to it. Stevens was the first US . ambassador to die in the line of duty since 1979. The terrorist plot stunned America on the anniversary of the 9/11 attacks on New York and Washington. The New York Times . reports that Obama has now ordered intelligence operatives to gather . 'target packages' on the perpetrators and track them down in Benghazi or . wherever they might have fled. 'They are putting together . information on where these individuals live, who their family members . and their associates are, and their entire pattern of life,' one US . official said. Once the targets and their locations . are confirmed, Obama could order any number of actions -- from drone . strikes to commando raids to joint operations with the Libyans. The Times reports that the operations is focusing on at least a dozen targets, though the exact number is not known. As with the bin Laden raid, Obama would likely make the final call on an raids or strikes to kill or capture the perpetrators. The consulate, located in the city of . Benghazi, was reportedly bombed twice in the months leading up to the . attack, which occurred on the 11th anniversary of the September 11 . terror attacks. The Daily Beast reported that various whistleblowers have come forward since the attack to testify about prior attacks and a series of threats, which are described in a letter from Rep Darrel Issa and Rep Jason Chaffetz to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. The letter, obtained by the site, says that both the consulate and Stevens were prime terror targets because threats had been made against both on Facebook. One such post mentioned the route that Stevens took on his morning jog, prompting the diplomat to briefly stop running for his own safety. Destruction: A man walks in the rubble of the consulate after the attack that claimed four Americans . The letter also mentions two separate . bombings on the consulate - one on April 6 (when two former security . guards hurled improvised explosives at the building) and another on June . 6. Neither attack resulted in deaths or injuries. The revelations came as the White House announced it was pulling all U.S. personnel out of Benghazi, Libya's second-largest city. Bomb attacks on the facility on April 6 and June 6 . Specific threats on Facebook threatening Ambassador Chris Stevens . Officials initially claimed that attack was a protest gone wrong, despite clues that it was a planned terrorist act . White House admitted last week that it knew the attack was terrorism, despite first statements on Benghazi assault . State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland told The Washington Post: 'Everybody who was in Benghazi and posted there has been withdrawn.' Yesterday, new evidence suggested that there were obvious clues that terrorism was involved in the attack, despite initial claims by officials that it was a protest gone wrong. Stevens and three other Americans - Sean Smith, Tyron Woods and Glen Doherty - perished in the assault. Confusion over what sparked the Benghazi violence may have stemmed from the CIA, which distributed 'talking points' to top officials on September 14. The unclassified documents, obtained by The Daily Beast, said in part: 'The currently available information suggests that the demonstrations in Benghazi were spontaneously inspired by the protests at the U.S. Embassy in Cairo and evolved into a direct assault against the U.S. diplomatic post in Benghazi and subsequently its annex.' 'There are indications that extremists participated in the violent demonstrations.' Likely working off the CIA document, . government officials like UN Ambassador Susan Rice and White House Press . Secretary Jay Carney, said there was little evidence the violence was . planned. However, the document went on to say that the 'assessment may change as additional information is collected' and that the investigation is 'on-going.' Flames: The White House has admitted they knew the deadly assault, pictured, was an act of terrorism within 24 hours . Additionally, The Daily Beast reported that an intercepted phone call between a local militia group called Ansar al-Shariah and al-Qaeda's north Africa arm, al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM), indicated that the two factions worked and planned the attack together. On Saturday, the Obama . administration admitted that it knew within 24 hours that the strike . was a pre-planned terrorist attack and not by crazed protestors enraged . by an anti-Islam film. Senior U.S. officials have now . confessed the government privately labelled the attack a terrorist act . almost immediately after it happened, and even knew that the . perpetrators had links to al-Qaeda. Assault: The U.S. Consulate in Benghazi was burned during a protest by an armed group on the eleventh anniversary of the September 11 attacks . Shawn Turner, a spokesman for . Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, said that as U.S. intelligence subsequently learned more about the attack, 'we revised our . initial assessment to reflect new information indicating that it was a . deliberate and organized terrorist attack carried out by extremists.' Turner said it remained 'unclear' if . any individual or specific group commanded the attack. U.S. agencies . nonetheless believe that some of the militants involved in the attack . were 'linked to groups affiliated with, or sympathetic to al-Qaeda.' Rep Peter King, a senior Republican from New York, demanded last week that Rice resign over her statement that the Benghazi attack was not premeditated. Connection: Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton said last week that there was an explicit link between al-Qaeda and the September 11 attack on the consulate in Benghazi . The State Department rejected King's call this afternoon, defending Rice and saying she has done 'a superb job.' Last week, Secretary of State Hillary . Clinton admitted there was an explicit link between the al-Qaeda network . in North Africa and the deadly attacks that killed Ambassador Stevens as well as information management officer Sean . Smith and security personnel Tyrone Woods and Glen Doherty.. Speaking at a Security Council . meeting at the United Nations, Mrs Clinton said an Algerian-founded . branch of the al-Qaeda network was situated in the area, using their . location to plan and execute attacks, like the one in Benghazi on .

It wasn’t long before I felt the need to go home. ‘Five of us had driven in a Mini, from London. We got back into the car and set off down the M40. Almost immediately I seemed to be being assaulted by the white lines, flashing into my head. As I approached the first bridge over the road I became convinced that the car was too big to pass through it. I pulled over.’ Mr Snow said the only person who had not eaten the flan drove for the remainder of the journey.

An eminent nutrition expert is urging people to spurn half-litre cans of Red Bull and other energy drinks because they contain dangerous levels of caffeine and sugar. A 473ml can of Red Bull, costing £1.99, contains an astonishing 13 teaspoons of sugar and 150 mg of caffeine, roughly the same as four cups of instant coffee. Biological scientist and nutrition expert Dr Hans-Peter Kubis says there is no need for such a high concentration of the substances as the potential health consequences include rapid or irregular heartbeat, . elevated blood pressure, sleeping trouble, weight gain, muscle twitching, . diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting - and even sudden death. How much?: Red Bull's 473ml can (right) contains 52g of sugar, roughly the same as 13 teaspoons . Earlier this year he released the findings of a Bangor University study into what soft drinks do to our bodies. The research shocked him so much he now . doesn't touch soft drinks, branding them 'evil', especially when combined with booze. He said: 'While there is good evidence . that caffeine has positive effects on cognitive performance of people - . we all know this from experience - there are also physiological effects. Buzz: Caffeine is an effective stimulant, but high volumes may be dangerous, according to Dr Kubis . Dr Kubis says there is no need for such high volumes of caffeine and sugar. He added: 'Every person has their own sensitivity for caffeine and certain younger people or people with undetected cardiovascular problems are at higher risk experiencing negative effects from caffeine. 'In fact caffeine blocks signals which are essential for a good regulation of blood pressure, heart rhythm and blood flow to muscle, kidney function and other tissues. 'The combination of high sugar and caffeine and alcohol obviously deceives the brain into the feeling of a high energy level while the rest of the body needs to cope with the negative effects of high caffeine and alcohol - sometimes leading to serious outcomes like sudden death. 'These drinks are disastrous for health. You cannot compensate for the amount of energy you're taking on.' Dr Kubis says there is no need for a large can size of soft drinks containing caffeine and high sugar levels and people should stay away from them. He added: 'You might think you save some money on a larger can size, but you take the risk that you ingest large amounts of caffeine in a short time with unexpected outcomes. 'Consumers have no insight into how much caffeine and sugar there is in the drink.' Comparisons with tea or coffee are misleading because people don't drink tea and coffees quickly as they are hot, usually come in smaller quantities and don't have 51g of sugar, Dr Kubis said. The best defence, he added, would be to increase taxes and limit advertising where children might see it, similar to alcohol and tobacco. 'The sugary taste also makes the drink appeal to children and youths who are not attracted by teas and coffees because of their bitter taste,' he added. 'The chance that a sensitive youth drinks the same 150mg caffeine from teas or coffees is extremely low, but there is a good chance that a youth drinks a second can of Red Bull.' Dominance: Red Bull is the biggest energy drink in the world. Last year it sold 4.6bn cans of Red Bull with a turnover of £3.4bn . Red Bull cans state that the beverage has a high caffeine content and is not recommended for children, pregnant women and 'persons sensitive to caffeine'. The company disputes the claim that the 473ml can has the same caffeine as four cups of coffee. A spokesperson added: 'A 473 ml can of Red Bull Energy Drink contains roughly the same amount of caffeine as two cups of coffee. 'We provide these larger can sizes because many consumers have indicated to us that they would like this choice.' Dr Kubis also believes that . liquid sugars not only alter our bodies, but also foster addict-like . responses. Countries such as Denmark and France are introducing soft-drink taxes to cut consumption. Red Bull was founded in 1984 by Austrian Dietrich Mateschitz, who became aware of popular 'tonic drinks' while in the Far East. Now Red Bull is the world's biggest energy drink, selling around 30bn cans in 164 countries since 1987.","Half-litre cans of Red Bull contain 52g of sugar and the same caffeine as four cups of coffee .

The incident is only the latest in a series of dangerous malfunctions American Airlines' fleet has suffered in the last few days, which have included rows of seats coming loose on several planes. Hear pilot's emergency distress call below over loose seats . Faulty flight: Another American Airlines flight has been forced to make an emergency landing after a passenger smelled smoke mid-flight . The flight was carrying 246 passengers and 14 crew members. 'The flight was on its way to Heathrow and there was a report of smoke in the cabin,' spokesman Ian Bradley told MailOnline. 'No one saw any smoke, there was just a smell. You don't take chances with something like that.' The flight landed at Ireland's Shannon Airport where an inspection of the scent took place. Mechanics determined that an overhead fan had overheated and the fan was removed. The passengers were given accommodation in Ireland, Mr Bradley said, and will finish their journey on the same aircraft first thing tomorrow morning. Meanwhile, a total of ten American Airlines . planes have been grounded following concerns over the safety of . passengers after two flights had to make emergency landings when rows of . seats came loose. There were two separate incidents in . which passenger seats came loose mid-flight on American Airlines planes . in the last three days. No passengers were injured. As a result, the struggling airline announced that it has temporarily grounded an additional eight planes for evaluation. Fright: On Saturday, a Miami-bound flight took off from Boston when the row of seats became unhinged and slid around the cabin, forcing the plane to make an emergency landing at New York City's JFK Airport . The . airline, whose parent AMR Corp filed for bankruptcy protection in . November, said that they have been working with federal safety . administrations to make sure that all of their planes are up to par. 'There . are at least a dozen reasons why a row of seats could become loose. We . are in contract with the FAA, and the FAA is aware of our internal . review. Safety is our top priority. We never have, nor will we, . compromise the safety and reliability of our fleet,' Company . spokeswoman Mary Frances Fagan said in an emailed statement that an . initial internal investigation 'indicated that there could be a possible . issue with a certain model of seats and how they fit into the tracking . used to secure the seats'.

A second plane was discovered to have loose seats on Monday after taking off for Miami and was forced to return to JFK. Flight 443 left Kennedy at 7.11 am and returned to the gate around an hour later. After a delay of two hours, passengers continued on their journey. Airline and government officials discouraged speculation that the incidents could be related to labor-management tension at American, which is cutting labor costs and laying off maintenance workers as it tries to turn around under bankruptcy protection. 'No one saw any smoke, there was just a smell. You don't take chances with something like that.'American Airlines Spokesman Ian Bradley . The airline, which began implementing cost cuts for its pilots last month, has had to cancel hundreds of flights recently due to an increase in pilot-initiated maintenance requests and sick leave usage. American Airlines said on September 27 that it warned its pilots union it would take legal action if the union fails to ensure the airline operates smoothly. Last week American accused some pilots of conducting an illegal work slowdown that has led to a spike in delayed and canceled flights. The airline threatened to take the pilots' union to court. The delays and cancellations have annoyed passengers, but even the hint of mechanical issues could frighten them away and even threaten American's existence, experts said. 'These things can kill an airline,' said George Hobica, founder of travel website airfarewatchdog.com. 'With a delay or cancellation, you're sitting on the ground.

The true scale of America's financial crisis has been exposed after it was revealed that every man, woman and child in the country owes more than $13,000 in state debt. Researchers found that state governments face a combined debt of more than $4trillion. When broken down to a per capita basis, this means that every American - including babies born each day - owes $13,425. For private sector workers, who are at increased risk and shoulder much of the state tax burden, that figure increases to an eye-watering $37,486 per person. Already in debt: Every American - including newborns - owes $13,425, according to a study . The figures were published yesterday by State Budget Solutions, a nonpartisan organisation pushing for state budget reform. Bob Williams, president of State Budget Solutions, said that the aim of the study is to highlight how much state debt is costing each resident. The report calculates total state debt per capita, per private sector employee, and as a percentage of private sector gross state product. In each of the three categories, Hawaii, New Jersey, and Alaska are among states with the five largest debt figures. At the other end of the spectrum, Nebraska has the lowest total in each of the areas. The largest per capita debt figure for all 50 states is Alaska, where each person's share of state debt stands at $31,141. New Jersey, Hawaii, Connecticut, and Illinois make up the top five states with the highest per capita share of the state debt. Nebraska, on the other hand, has the lowest total debt per capita at just $4,249 for each resident. Tennessee, Indiana, Florida, and Idaho round out the lowest five debt levels per capita. Private sector workers are at increased risk as they are the ultimate tax base for reducing state debt. Using figures from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, State Budget Solutions determined that Hawaii has the largest debt per private sector worker at $83,815, followed by Alaska, New Jersey, Connecticut, and New Mexico. Nebraska again has the lowest total, with $9,829 in debt for each private sector employee. Indiana, Tennessee, North Dakota, and South Dakota follow. State Budget Solutions also calculated state debt as a percentage of private sector gross state product (GSP). Hawaii's debt stands at 79.21 per cent of its entire private sector GSP, the highest percentage of the 50 states. New Jersey is again right behind with its debt representing 59.69 per cent of private sector GSP. Ohio, New Mexico, and Alaska constitute the rest of the top five. Nebraska, Tennessee, Indiana, North Dakota, and Virginia have the lowest debts as a percentage of private GSP.","State governments face combined debt of more than $4trillion .

Peeping Tom: Declan Crosbie was caught trying to spy on female members of the Chinese Olympic swimming team at The Edge sports centre in Leeds . He had been due to be sentenced this month after pleading guilty to trespassing with intent to commit a sexual offense, but his hearing at Leeds Crown Court has been delayed until September 17. Last month, Leeds Magistrates Court heard that when staff approached the locked toilet Crosbie attempted to answer them in a woman's voice. When he exited, he was found to be 'dressed smartly, carrying a rucksack' with 'his fly undone'. Karen Williams, prosecuting, said: 'At 11.30 in the morning, the receptionist at the university sports centre was made aware of a male in the female changing room.' The receptionist, duty manager and a security guard at the sports centre, one of two in the city hosting Olympic swimming teams, went down to investigate. Practicing: The Chinese Swimming team have been using the facilities at The Edge sports centre to prepare for the Olympic games . Ms Williams continued: 'When they challenged him, he answered in a lady’s voice.' When he heard that the police were being called Crosbie, from Leeds, broke free and escaped from the sports centre. He was later apprehended by police. Crosbie, who has previous convictions for voyeurism and was placed on the Sex Offenders Register for life in 2009, pleaded guilty to one charge of trespassing with intent to commit a sexual offence and will be sentenced next month. Serial offender Crosbie has previous convictions for peering at women under leisure centre cubicles and was jailed for three years in 2009 after a court heard how he was found inside a house standing over a sleeping woman with her trousers down. Crosbie pleased guilty to trespassing with intent to commit a sexual offence at Leeds Magistrates Court, pictured above, and will be sentenced next month . He was remanded in custody until his sentencing. A spokesperson from the University of Leeds said: 'When this incident occurred, the athletes from the Olympic team were not booked in for a training session at the sports centre, so the highest level of security which is reserved for when athletes are training was not active. 'Nonetheless, the intruder was detected, identified and subsequently arrested. 'The sports centre is used by staff, students and members of the public, and fortunately this type of event is very rare. 'However, we will of course be reviewing our security to see whether there is anything else we need to do to protect our users.'","Declan Crosbie, 25, locked himself in toilet cubicle .

A bizarre feud between two families over who owned a £50,000 horse turned violent when three women were attacked with a whip in their own stables, a court heard. Dorothy Rugg-Easey, 71, and her former stablehand Gemma Beavis, 36, had been rowing over valuable pure-bred mare Stella for over a year. Yard owner Ms Rugg-Easey said she loaned breeding horse Stella to Ms Beavis but agreed the valuable horse would be kept on her property and Beavis would visit to ride her. The contested horse: Former stablehand Gemma Beavis who claims she was given a valuable pure bred mare called Stella . Attacked: Dorothy Rugg-Easey, left, her daughter Liz, centre, and her granddaughter Jess who were assaulted by a friend of Ms Beavis, John Thompson. Ms Beavis said she knew nothing about the incident . But in August last year Stella, a Morgan breed, disappeared from Ms Rugg-Easey’s farm and turned up at another local stables. Ms Beavis claimed Ms Rugg-Easey had agreed to let the horse be moved elsewhere but Ms Rugg-Easey accused her of taking the animal without permission. Ms Rugg-Easey’s family called police asking for help and begged Ms Beavis to return the horse, but to no avail. Eventually fed-up Ms Rugg-Easey and her family hatched a late-night plan to get her prized horse back by lifting the gate at the stables of its hinges and walking the horse home. But the feud came to a head when Ms Beavis’s close family friend John Thompson, 58, broke into Ms Rugg-Easey’s stables in Blean, Kent, in the early hours of August 11 this year. Prized possession: The pure bred horse called Stella was worth £50,000 . Canterbury Magistrates’ Court heard . Thompson beat Ms Rugg-Easey, her daughter Liz, 43, and granddaughter . Jess, 17, with a three-foot horse whip. The . drunken attack only came to an end when Jess’s fiance Josh Mapp, 20, . ran in shouting ‘you don’t hit women’ and tied Thompson up with a rope. Thompson avoided jail on Monday when he was handed a suspended sentence at Canterbury Magistrates’ Court after admitting three counts of assault by beating. He was jailed for 160 days, but the sentence was suspended for two years. He was also ordered to do 150 hours' unpaid work and must pay £250 compensation and £85 costs. Ms Beavis denies any involvement or knowledge of Thompson's actions. But incredibly, both families now claim they have had the steed stolen from their stables by the other family. They are due to have another showdown in the courts after Ms Beavis lodged a private claim for the animal against Ms Rugg-Easey. Ms Beavis, a mother-of-four who works . as a cleaner, said: 'I kept Stella at Dorothy’s stables for a while . before asking if I could move her to another stables half a mile down . the road. Dorothy said yes. 'Then I started getting solicitors’ letters saying I had to bring Stella back. She claimed the horse was on a . life-time loan agreement. 'I refused to give the horse back as I believed I rightfully owned her. Ongoing battle: Mother of four Gemma Beavis, pictured with Stella, has made a private civil court claim for the horse against Ms Rugg-Easey . 'We were good friends, I did some . mucking out for her. She knew I could not afford a horse and I was . extremely grateful that she gave me Stella. 'I do not know what made Dorothy change her mind. 'I do not want to fight with the . woman. It is sad that it has got like this. It has hit my family hard . too, my children are very upset and I am suffering from stress. 'She is making me out to be a horse thief and saying I do not look after horses properly.' Both Gemma Beavis, pictured with Stella and Dorothy Rugg-Easey claim to own the horse . But . great-grandmother-of-three Ms Rugg-Easey insists she is the victim and . has not slept properly since being beaten with the horse whip. Speaking . after the hearing, Ms Rugg-Easey said: 'I have CCTV on my stables and . when I was woken by the dogs barking I was up in a flash. 'I grabbed a three-foot schooling whip and went to see what was going on. 'This . big brute of a man was leaning on the stable door and when I asked him . what he was doing he snatched the whip and starting hitting me with it. 'I was lying on the ground in my nightie with my legs kicking. 'I think he should have gone to prison and for a long time. I truly believe he came to get me and take the horse.' Liz, a fitness instructor, came to her mother’s aid during the incident. After . the court hearing she said: 'It must have been just after 1am. I could . hear mum screaming and crying and thought ‘the old girl has finally lost . it.’ 'When I saw him . [Thompson] with the whip I thought I could calm the situation down but . as soon as I went outside - and I was only wearing a long T-shirt and . pair of knickers - he just punched me in the face.' The feud started last year when natural health scientist Ms Rugg-Easey, who owns the small livery yard and Morgan stud farm, was forced to give up Stella when she was diagnosed with vertigo and doctors banned her from riding. She says she entrusted Stella with former employee Ms Beavis under the agreement that she would be able to monitor her care at her stables. But on the night of August 14, 2011, Stella, who Ms Rugg-Easey had owned for seven years and schooled for five, was taken from the farm. Canterbury Magistrates¿ Court (above) heard Thompson beat Ms Rugg-Easey, her daughter Liz, 43, and granddaughter Jess, 17, with a three foot horse whip . The horse was kept away from the farm at another stables for almost a year before Ms Rugg-Easey took her back on August 7, 2012. Ms Rugg-Easey claims Stella was worth around £50,000 when she loaned her, but when she got her back she was lame and now only worth around £2,000. Then just four days after winning back her horse Ms Rugg-Easey, her daughter and granddaughter were attacked by drunk Thompson when he appeared in their stables. Ms Rugg-Easey and her daughter, who was left with a black eye and whip marks after the attack, have now installed infra-red CCTV cameras at their home. She said: 'I was told it would cost me 15 to 30 grand in legal expenses to prosecute her for stealing my horse - so I had no choice but to get her back myself. 'I put thousands of hours into schooling her and looking after her properly. Now she is lame.' She added: 'She was worth £50, 000 when I loaned her. Now she is probably worth less than 2, 000 - or just butcher meat. 'It’s unbelievable that I have to keep going to court to prove I own a horse which I clearly do and have all the paper work for.'","Dorothy Rugg-Easey, 71, and her former stablehand Gemma Beavis, 36, fell out over a disagreement on who owned a valuable pure bred mare .

Today, the streets were filled with riot police as the government showed it was determined not to allow another day of violence.

A police helicopter which could have saved a young man's life was not sent up because staff were due to go off duty, an inquest heard. Officers, family and friends were desperately searching on the ground for 21-year-old Danny Cavill who had threatened to harm himself after a night out. Mr Cavill was still alive when a request was put in to South Yorkshire Police for a helicopter to help find him but night-time air support staff declined as their shift was due to end 20 minutes later. An official investigation discovered that because 'a life was at risk' the shift should have been extended by an hour and Danny, who hanged himself, could have been saved. Acting Chief Inspector David Butler . who carried out an investigation into the police response told a . Rotherham inquest: 'We will never know if the helicopter would have . found Danny that morning, in my view it should have been given the . opportunity.' A police . sergeant has been reprimanded and air support staff given further . training following the tragedy at Sitwell Park Golf Club, near Whiston, . Rotherham where the 21-year-old was an assistant greenkeeper. Chief Insp Butler outlined a series of . mistakes by the force and said another helicopter could have been . called in from neighbouring forces but the call was never made. He . said the incident should have been classed as an 'immediate priority' and the police call centre handler did not elicit enough information . about Danny’s plight. An . expert search officer was not contacted and cell-site analysis was not . deployed which could have pinpointed Danny’s position within 200 metres . and narrowed down the search parameters. Mr Butler also said the police sergeant in charge of the search was working on a 'flawed assessment' passed to him second-hand from the family. The Rotherham hearing was told Danny, who was drunk, was ejected from the Liquid nightclub in Rotherham town centre about 2am on Saturday, May 7 last year. He phoned his best friend Josh Hill, 21, in a distressed manner and told him: 'Nobody likes me, I can’t get in contact with anyone. I’m going to do something stupid and I’m walking by the rail track now.' After Mr Hill raised the alarm police were called in and searchers initially went to a railway bridge where Danny had previously been found when drunk before the search switched to the golf club. Sgt Kevin Bradley, who was later reprimanded, said the family did not believe Danny would carry out the threat to harm himself and he only rated the incident as 'medium risk' so did not call out the consortium helicopter after the South Yorkshire chopper failed to get airborne. Mr Cavill was discovered at Sitwell Park Golf Club after he made a drunken phonecall threatening to harm himself . 'With the resources we had on the ground we did the best search possible of the golf course,' he told the hearing. 'I would have had to justify the other helicopter when we’re not sure he was going to carry out the threat.' Danny, who lived with his parents in Brinsworth, Rotherham was on a Friday night with friends in an 'upbeat' mood and looking forward to a holiday he had booked in Ibiza. He made a series of unanswered calls and texts to his girlfriend Simone Fox before attempts to contact him by phone failed. Mr Hill said: 'I never thought he would do something like this. He was the life and soul of the party. He was always the centre of attention and everyone loved him.' Miss Fox, 21, who had been drinking in the club with her girlfriends said she could not remember rowing with Danny. She managed to speak to him briefly by mobile when he went missing and found out he was at the golf course. She said: 'I thought it was a cry for attention. He knew we were looking for him and thought we would find him in time. He was drunk and I don’t really think he thought about what he was doing.' Danny’s father Stephen said: 'He liked going out on Friday nights with his mates. He used to like a drink and fell asleep in different places. That is what we thought had happened that night.' The 21-year-old had gone to the Liquid Nightclub with friends in an 'upbeat' mood and looking forward to a holiday he had booked in Ibiza . Delivering her verdict, Rotherham coroner Nicola Mundy criticised South Yorkshire Police’s response. She said: 'There were in my view shortcomings in the response. The quality of communication was disappointing in the extreme and fairly basic questions could have been asked which would have affected the prioritisation of the response. 'The question of the helicopter was not properly pursued when it should have been. It was available to be deployed had the proper questions been posed.' Ms Mundy went on: 'On balance I can say it is a possibility it would have altered the outcome. There were missed opportunities which could have affected the outcome.' She said Danny’s ejection from the nightclub affected him more profoundly than other people 'particularly when his attempts to contact friends and those close to him failed.' He was upset and had a 'disproportionate' reaction to what happened which was exacerbated by alcohol. 'After that things very quickly got out of control,' she said.

A prolific thief who was finally jailed for the first time after committing his 178th crime has continued to offend after stealing from two shops - just months after being released. Anthony Hughes, 40, had a string of convictions for robbery, theft, burglary, shoplifting and aggravated vehicle theft. Hughes was only jailed last February after he broke into his neighbour's house twice pinching things including washing up liquid and a new set of blinds. But just months after being released from jail Hughes was caught stealing £15 worth of alcohol from One Stop Shop and £47 of beer and wine from Tesco in Cambridge. Jailing him for 21 months in February 2011, Judge Anthony Bate told Cambridge Crown Court he had run out of patience with Hughes' offending. Judge Bate told Hughes: 'You have a shocking record of offences. I have no confidence that a community order will have any success. 'The only way to tackle your alcohol problem will be in prison where the opportunities of access to alcohol will be minimal.' Flynn Jennings, who prosecuted Hughes at Cambridge Magistrates' Court in 2006 for being more than twice the drink-drive limit in Cambridge, said he 'clearly has no regard for the law whatsoever'. He told the court: 'This man has more ""disqualified"" and ""drink-drivings"" on his record than I have time to count.' Hughes, from Trumpington, Cambs, pleaded guilty to the two new offences of theft at Cambridge Magistrates' Court on Wednesday. The court heard he stole £15 worth of alcohol from the One Stop Shop in Ditton Lane, Cambridge on September 7 and £47 of beer and wine from Tesco Express in East Road, Cambridge, on September 30. His latest two crimes put Hughes in breach of an 18-month conditional discharge which was imposed by magistrates in January. Hughes was released on unconditional bail and the case was adjourned for one week for further reports to be prepared. Caught again: Hughes admitted to stealing from the One Stop shop on Ditton Lane .

The NFL's involvement in Breast Cancer Awareness month has come under fire after claims the league is profiting from the cause. Players have been wearing pink caps, shirts, elbow pads, and boots and flashes of the color have adorned towels and parts of the field throughout October across the U.S. Fans can buy pink items from the National Football League shop, or bid in auctions for products seen during games. In the pink: Players display the pink kit that fans can buy in Breast Cancer Awareness month during a Chicago Bears vs Dallas Cowboys match in Texas . Piece of the action: Items worn by star players on the field are auctioned off later to football fans . Just for show? Critics claim most of the money raised from the sale of the special merchandise goes straight back to the NFL rather than to charity . The proceeds ostensibly go to help support the fight against breast cancer, but critics now allege that most of the cash ends up in the pockets of NFL owners. The website tells fans they can 'support the fight against breast cancer with pink NFL breast cancer awareness gear.' However, Business Week discovered that only 5 per cent of the sales are being donated to the American Cancer Society.  If the products have a typical . 100 per cent mark-up at retail point, that means the NFL is keeping 90 per cent of the profit . from the sale of the items.

Facebook is taking a small step toward becoming an e-commerce platform by launching a feature for users to buy and send real gifts - some of them worth as much as hundreds of dollars. As of Thursday, users can purchase and ship products from more than a hundred 'Facebook Gifts' vendors with a few clicks on the company's website. The products are only available in some U.S. cities and only to people randomly selected by Facebook to be 'beta users', but perhaps gives some indication how Facebook intends to evolve. Scroll down for video . Facebook's new service, 'Gifts', allows users to send chocolate, coffee, socks and other real-life presents to one another . The products include eyeglasses by Warby Parker, Starbucks coffee, and pastries from New York-based Magnolia Bakery. Coming four months after Facebook's troubled initial public offering, the feature marks the company's attempt to unlock a potentially significant new revenue stream. Although it has sought to diversify its income sources, Facebook still relies heavily on display advertising. During the second quarter, more than 80 percent of its revenue of $1.18 billion came from ads while roughly 15 percent came from game-maker Zynga Inc. Facebook, which can store credit card data for users, will make money by taking a cut of each gift transaction. Fancy a gift while you vhat? Teddy bears are one of the gifts available on Facebook . The amount varies based on the individual deals it has struck with vendor partners, the company said without disclosing specifics. The world's No. 1 social network, boasting nearly 1 billion user accounts, has long viewed commercial transactions as a massive opportunity for the platform. But marketing researchers have found that consumers have been slow to make purchases on the website because many treat it as a place to chat and post messages rather than go shopping. Facebook hopes to change that by getting users used to the idea of giving small gifts as part of their social routine. ""People already use Facebook to communicate with their friends and share all of their life moments,"" said Lee Linden, a Facebook product manager heading the Gifts feature. ""Gifting is just a natural extension of that behavior. It makes a lot of sense for us not to just say 'Happy Birthday' but to send a gift, not just say 'I love you' but send some flowers."" Current gifts cost $5 up to several hundred dollars for a Jambox stereo by Aliph Inc, said Linden, who joined the company in May. His previous start-up, Karma, was acquired by Facebook in a deal announced on the day of Facebook's high-profile IPO. Facebook had experimented with a ""virtual"" gift-exchange feature years ago, but shut it down in 2010. The original gifts were no more than digital trinkets, cartoon images of flower bouquets, teddy bears and even women's underwear. Linden said Facebook now aims to provide effortless shopping and shipping of real goods. Users are alerted when their packages are shipped and received, and every package comes with a customizable card stamped with a Facebook logo. Recipients who do not like their gifts can discreetly swap colors or sizes for no charge. ""We think we can make an end-to-end way to buy a product that is very seamless,"" Linden said. ""We take care in the photos, in the packaging, in everything."" The service will be initially available to a random group of U.S. users logging into Facebook through its website and an Android app. An iPhone app is still in development, Linden said.","Random sub-set of users are offered 'Gifts' service as Facebook tries out real-world transactions .

Rashid Rauf, pictured, a high-ranking Al Qaeda planner who was killed by a CIA drone strike . The family of a high-ranking Al Qaeda planner killed by a CIA drone strike are to sue the British government for helping to murder him. Rashid Rauf, a fugitive Briton who played a pivotal role in coordinating the airline bomb plot, was reportedly killed in a U.S missile attack on a Taliban safe house in Pakistan's tribal areas in 2008. His family is now to launch a legal . challenge accusing the Government of being complicit in the murder of . one of its own citizens on foreign soil. British intelligence officers who shared . information about him with their US counterparts may . be judged to have assisted in his murder, or of committing war crimes. Rauf, 27, a former baker's boy from Birmingham, was on a CIA ‘High Value Target’ list because of his alleged role as a chief planner for Al Qaeda attacks on the West. Intelligence services also believe he was the brains behind the July 7 London tube attacks, and that he masterminded the failed 2006 plot to blow up US airliners flying from Heathrow, using liquid bombs. A close friend of the family, who have always maintained that Rauf had no links with Al Qaeda, told the Sunday Mercury: 'They want justice for their son who was killed in murky circumstances that amount to cold-blooded murder. 'Rashid never had a chance to defend or explain himself. He was accused of some heinous crimes and without any trial, judge or jury he was blown to pieces by a unmanned Predator drone aircraft controlled by a soldier sitting thousands of miles away in the US. 'The Americans could not have found and killed him without help from British intelligence officers who shared information. 'The family want answers. They want to see the evidence that Rashid was a dangerous terrorist.' The British government has consistently refused to say whether or not its signals intelligence agency, the Cheltenham-based GCHQ, passes information in support of the CIA drone operations over Pakistan. But media reports have quoted sources at GCHQ claiming it has better interception networks than the CIA in south Asia, and that it has shared information about the locations of Al Qaeda and Taliban commanders in Afghanistan and Pakistan. Intelligence services believe Rauf, centre, was the brains behind the July 7 London tube attacks, and that he masterminded the failed 2006 plot to blow up US airliners flying from Heathrow . The Rauf family have been encouraged to launch their legal challenge after lawyers for a young Pakistani man, whose father was killed by a drone strike, seek to have the sharing of UK locational intelligence declared unlawful. Noor Khan, 27, is said to live in constant fear of a repeat of the attack in North Waziristan in March last year which killed more than 40 other people. In a landmark case at the High Court in London last week, Mr Khan launched an application for a judicial review examining the UK’s alleged complicity in the CIA’s drone campaign. If Khan’s case is successful, judges will be forced to examine whether GCHQ officers can legally share information on the location of individuals if they believe this may be used to target them with drone strikes. Khan’s barrister Martin Chamberlain told High Court judges that while soldiers who kill as part of an international armed conflict are protected from prosecution, it’s unclear whether the turmoil in Pakistan’s volatile tribal belt constitutes a war. A spokesman for human rights charity Reprieve said: 'This anomaly could make the killings unlawful and British officials who shared intelligence leading to those killings would be guilty of accessory to murder. 'Even if this is held to be a war, the drone strikes could break international humanitarian law by exceeding what ‘proportionate and necessary’ is leaving officers who share intelligence at risk of assisting crimes against humanity or war crimes.' A spokesman for the Rauf family last night said their legal action would not be intended to convict any individuals of a crime but to seek a declaration by the British civil courts that such intelligence sharing is unlawful.","Al Qaeda planner, from Birmingham, played role in coordinating airline bomb plot .

These incredible pictures show how a cheeky octopus foiled the efforts of marine researchers to investigate the feeding habits of sea life. The researchers dropped a bait cage into the waters of False Bay, Cape Town, as part of a survey of creatures living off the coast of South Africa. But they didn't count on this thieving invertebrate sneaking along and not only stealing the food, but taking away the entire cage itself. Scroll down for video . What's this then? The curious octopus swims straight up to the bait box dropped into the water by marine conservationists . Getting to grips with it: The invertebrate wraps its tentacles around the bait box to examine it in more detail . Yank, pull, heave! The octopus envelops the box in its entirety while yanking on the chain that connects it to the scientists' boat above . Mine now! The creature scoots off, leaving the Save Our Seas Foundation with a bill for some new equipment . Remarkable video footage of the heist shows the widely studied intelligence of octopuses, which is such that in British animal testing laws they are regarded as 'honorary vertebrates' and afforded rights not generally extended related species. It shows schools of fish swimming around the cage, attracted by the bait it is ejecting into the surrounding waters. All seems fairly mundane, until the octopus floats along and wraps its tentacles around the cylinder. The tenacious animal envelops the contraption entirely, tugging on the chain connecting the cylinder to the researchers' boat above and bracing itself against the sea floor for leverage. It wrestles with the box for some time, no doubt scoffing any food it is ejecting while thwarting the hapless fish who hope to pick up any scraps left behind. Then, as suddenly as it appeared, the octopus swims off, with the bait box securely in its grip - leaving a lonely chain anchored to the sea floor and the marine biologists facing a bill for new equipment. False Bay, off Cape Town, South Africa, where the video was recorded by marine conservationists . Octopuses are believed to be highly intelligent, more so than any other kind of invertebrates; but their learning capability is still much debated among biologists. The creatures have been known to break out of aquariums and into others in search of food, and they have even boarded fishing boats and opened holds to eat crabs stored inside. They are the only invertebrate which has been shown to use tools, with some species, as pictured above right, retrieving discarded coconut shells and reassembling them to use as shelter. Maze and problem-solving experiments have shown evidence that the animals have a memory system that can store both short and long-term memory, but it is not known precisely what contribution learning has on adult octopus behaviour. In laboratory experiments they can be readily trained to distinguish between different shapes and patterns. In several widely contested studies, they have even been shown to practise observational learning. In some countries, octopuses are on the list of experimental animals on which surgery may not be performed without anaesthesia. British animal testing laws regard them as 'honorary vertebrates', extending them protections not afforded to other invertebrates. The incredible scene was witnessed by marine biologists funded by the Save Our Seas foundation who deployed their Baited Remote Underwater Video (BRUV) system in False Bay to investigate the decline of sea life in the area. Lauren de Vos, a research assistant at the University of Cape Town’s Marine Research Institute, explained on the Save Our Seas blog how the aim of the study is to develop an understanding of the conservation status of fish in the area, which has been heavily exploited by man for nearly two centuries. 'By attracting fish into the field of view of a remotely-controlled camera, the technique records diversity, abundance and behaviour of species,' she said. 'As a non-extractive technique, it offers a low environmental impact way of understanding changes in fish numbers and diversity over time.' After two centuries of exploitation by fishermen, many species in South African waters are now in serious decline, Ms de Vos said. However monitoring of the conservation situation of much of the sea life has been inadequate as a result of the cost and practicality of getting down to the sea floor. BRUV surveys were first developed in Australia. They attract fish into the field of view of a remotely controlled camera, allowing researchers to record the diversity, abundance and behaviour of species. Ms de Vos added: 'With a long history of fishing activity, False Bay presents an important and interesting site for the development of a BRUV monitoring system that will maximise the amount of data collected on any given day, and lower the costs of doing so to become a realistic option for fishery and MPA managers’ budgets.'","Octopuses so intelligent British law treats them as 'honorary vertebrates'

Alison Jukes, 43, of Midsomer Norton, Somerset, was two years ago diagnosed with gastroparesis, a condition which prevents her stomach from properly digesting food. She suffers vomiting and nausea whenever she tries to eat or drink; to stay alive she receives nutrients through a tube directly into her abdomen. Suffering: Alison Jukes, 43, before she developed gastroparesis (left) and after. She is begging the NHS for an operation that could help her to live a 'near-normal life' Her weight has plummetted from 12st in 2010 to just seven stone today and she has been forced to give up her job as a primary school teaching assistant because of sickness and lack of energy. Mrs Jukes has been battling for an operation which she hopes would help her to live a 'near-normal life'. A consultant in London suggested she have a gastric pacemaker fitted - designed to stimulate her stomach - and referred her to the NHS for treatment. But Bath & Somerset Primary Care Trust told her the operation, which costs up to £35,000, is not a proven solution to her illness and its funding panel rejected her application and her appeal. Staying alive: Mrs Jukes with the Nutricia infinity pump that feeds her directly via her stomach. She must use it between 6pm and 9am every day . Mrs Jukes, who is married to Tim, 27, and has two sons, Charlie, 15, and George, 17, said that it was a 'heart-breaking decision', with her condition leaving her unable to look after her family. 'I wouldn’t be able to stand up long enough to make a whole meal for anyone,' she said. 'Not being able to look after them is the biggest problem for me. It’s so frustrating.' Mrs Jukes said her pump had to run between 6pm and 9am every day. On the rare occasions she's up at those times, she must carry a special backpack containing the mechanism.

A tiny fragment of finger bone has enabled scientists to map out the entire genetic code of the Denisovans, a little-known ancient cousin of modern humans. Evidence suggests that the Denisovans, who lived in Siberia around 50,000 years ago, had dark skin, brown hair and brown eyes. Previous research has suggested they co-existed with Neanderthals and interbred with our own species, Homo sapiens. The tiny fragment of finger bone has enabled scientists to map out the entire genetic code of the Denisovans, a little-known ancient cousin of modern humans . The researchers compared the Denisovan genome with genomes of several modern humans from around the world. The Denisovans share more genes with populations from the islands of southeastern Asia, including Melanesia and Australian Aborigines, than with populations elsewhere in Asia. Analysis of the Denisovan genome further illuminates the relationships of Neandertals with individuals from East Asia, South America and Europe. The existence of the Denisovans was only confirmed in 2010. Scientists made the discovery after studying DNA from a piece of finger bone and two molars found at Denisova Cave in the Altai Mountains of southern Siberia. Today the same group reported results from full scale genome sequencing which produced a Denisovan genetic blueprint on a par with those obtained for modern humans. Because they had only a tiny sample of material from the finger bone, Svante Pääbo and his research team developed a treatment that unzipped the DNA so that each of its two strands can be used to generate molecules for sequencing. This method allowed the team to generate an extremely thorough genome sequence (30X), similar in quality to what researchers can obtain for the modern human genome. The scientists found that the Denisovans were most genetically similar to Australian aborigines and island populations from south-east Asia. The top of a molar from a Denisovan, a little-known ancient cousin of modern humans . The molar that helped researchers piece together the genetic code of one of our ancient cousins, which existed in Siberia 50,000 years ago . They listed about 100,000 changes in the human genetic code that occurred after Homo sapiens and Denisovans parted company on the path of evolution. They also show that the Denisovan individual whose genome was sequenced carried genetic variants that in present-day humans are associated with dark skin, brown hair and brown eyes, and that the genetic diversity of the Denisovans themselves was extremely low. Given the Denisovans’ wide geographic range over time, the team say it’s likely that their population was initially quite small but grew quickly, without time for genetic diversity to increase . The finger bone fragment, seen here next to a U.S. cent, was the key in extracting DNA and sequencing our closest relative for the first time . 'This research will help determine how it was that modern human populations came to expand dramatically in size as well as cultural complexity while archaic humans eventually dwindled in numbers and became physically extinct,' said lead scientist Professor Svante Paabo, from the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany. The entrance to the Denisova cave in southern Siberia where the discovery was made . The cave was discovered high on a hillside in the Altai Mountains of southern Siberia . The research is published today in the journal Science. There are hints that both the Denisovans and Neanderthals emerged from a single population that migrated out of Africa. Modern humans are believed to have left Africa to colonise other parts of the world hundreds of thousands of years later. In time, Homo sapiens inherited the Earth while the Neanderthals and Denisovans became extinct. The researchers also found that people from eastern Asia and South America possessed slightly more Neanderthal genes than those from Europe. This suggests that their ancient ancestors were more likely to have interbred with Neanderthals. Researchers working inside the cave where the discovery was made.

Robert Thomas, a veterans hospital X-ray tech, was there with his wife, Marsha Colbert. Colbert stood on a bench along a campus street taking pictures as Thomas and others whooped with joy. 'It's beautiful. Oh, my god,' Thomas said as it flew over. Thursday's flyover gives NASA a chance to honour Giffords' legacy as a long-time advocate for American human spaceflight, NASA spokeswoman Lisa Malone told The Associated Press in an email. She said no additional costs would be incurred by honoring Kelly's request. Hundreds of people gathered Wednesday to watch the shuttle land in Houston for an overnight stay, an exciting but bittersweet moment for many residents who felt spurned that Space City wasn't chosen as the final home for one of the five retired shuttles. 'I think that it's the worst thing that they can do, rotten all the way,' said 84-year-old Mary Weiss, clinging to her walker just before Endeavour landed after flying low over Gulf Coast towns, New Orleans and then downtown Houston and its airports.

The incredible journey: The shuttle passed through Austin shortly after morning broke . It's the ultimate piggyback ride, and scores have asked what it's like to haul a 170,000-pound shuttle. 'That's a tough thing to answer,' said pilot Jeff Moultrie, who will be in command when Endeavour performs an aerial tour over several California landmarks Friday. 'What do you tell somebody? It's different.' The noise decibels louder inside the shuttle carrier aircraft compared with a commercial airliner because the interior is hollowed out to keep it as light as possible. There are no galleys, overhead bins or even air conditioning. Pilots have to be hyper-vigilant about the weather because moisture can damage the shuttle's delicate tiles. Built for American Airlines, NASA acquired the aircraft in 1974 and used it for test flights from Edwards Air Force Base in California's Mojave Desert and ferry flights to the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. The four current NASA pilots who can operate the modified 747 are ex-military aviators who split their time flying other planes including zero-gravity aircraft and T-38 supersonic jets. Space City, partly made famous by Tom . Hanks when he uttered the line 'Houston, we have a problem' in the movie . 'Apollo 13,' has long tied its fortune to a mix of oil and NASA. Astronauts train in the humid, . mosquito-ridden city, and many call it home years after they retire. The . Johnson Space Center and an adjacent museum hug Galveston Bay. Houston's bid for a shuttle was rejected after the White House retired the fleet last summer to spend more time and money on reaching destinations, such as Mars and asteroids. Instead, Houston got a replica that used to be displayed at the Kennedy Space Center. 'The one we're getting is a toy. An important toy, but a toy nonetheless,' said Scott Rush, 54, of Crystal Beach, Texas. Still, people came out in droves Wednesday, waving American flags and toting space shuttle toys, cameras and cell phones. Back-to-back delays in the ferry flight resulted in one day being cut from the Houston visit. After landing, the Endeavour rolled slowly in front of the cheering crowd. It circled and preened like a runway model, giving awed spectators an opportunity to take pictures from a variety of angles. 'I want to go on it,' said 3-year-old Joshua Lee as he headed to the landing area with his mother and grandmother. The shuttle took off after sunrise Thursday, riding piggyback on a jumbo jet. It stopped at Biggs Army Airfield in El Paso, Texas, before heading toward Tucson and then on to NASA's Dryden Flight Research Center, California. After spending a night there, the shuttle will head to Los Angeles International Airport on Friday. In mid-October, Endeavour will be transported down city streets to the California Science Center, its permanent home. NASA still plays a large role in Houston, and astronaut Clayton Anderson, who lived on the International Space Station from June to November 2007, encouraged people to focus on a new era of space exploration. 'The shuttles are a wonderful legacy, a huge part of Houston, but now it's time to look to the future,' said Anderson, who lives in the Houston suburb of League City. This is the last flight for a space shuttle. Atlantis will remain at Kennedy for display, and Discovery already is at the Smithsonian Institution, parked at a hangar in Virginia since April. Endeavour - the replacement for the destroyed Challenger shuttle - made its debut in 1992 and flew 25 times before it was retired.

Pet owners have been warned next time they have the flu, they may not just pass it on to friends and family - they might also infect their animals. Thankfully, the chances are relatively slim, but US researchers said greater awareness was needed of the phenomenon, known as 'reverse zoonosis.' They added that people who experienced an influenza-like virus, should distance themselves from their animals. Around 80 to 100million households have a cat or dog in the U.S, with 20million domestic felines and pooches in the UK. Is your pet poorly? The first recorded, probable case of fatal human-to-cat transmission of H1N1 flu occurred in Oregon in 2009 . It’s well known that new strains of . influenza can evolve from animal populations such as pigs and birds and . ultimately move into human populations, including the most recent . influenza pandemic strain, H1N1. It’s less appreciated, experts say, . that humans appear to have passed the H1N1 flu to cats and other . animals, some of which have died of respiratory illness. Professor Chistiane Loehr, from Oregon State University, who is looking into the phenomenon, said: 'We worry a lot about zoonoses, the . transmission of diseases from animals to people. 'But . most people don’t realize that humans can also pass diseases to animals, . and this raises questions and concerns about mutations, new viral forms . and evolving diseases that may potentially be zoonotic. 'And, of course, . there is concern about the health of the animals.' So far there are only a handful of known cases . of people spreading flu to their animals but this could be due to poor awareness of the phenomenon. Researchers at Oregon State University and Iowa State University are now working to find more cases of this type of disease transmission to better understand the risks to people and their pets. They said people with influenza-like illnesses should distance themselves from their pets. If a pet experiences respiratory disease or other illness following household exposure to someone with flu, they should take them to the vet for tests. The first recorded, probable case of fatal human-to-cat transmission of the pandemic H1N1 flu virus occurred in Oregon in 2009, Loehr said. Details were published in Veterinary Pathology, a professional journal. In that instance, a pet owner became severely ill with the flu and had to be hospitalized. While she was still in the hospital, her cat - an indoor cat with no exposure to other sick people, homes or wildlife - also died of pneumonia caused by an H1N1 infection. Since then, researchers have identified a total of 13 cats and one dog with pandemic H1N1 infection in 2011 and 2012 that appeared to have come from humans. Pet ferrets have also been shown to be infected, and some died. All of the animals’ symptoms were similar to that of humans - they rapidly develop severe respiratory disease, stop eating and some die. Serological studies suggest there is far more exposure to flu virus in cats and dogs than previously known. 'It’s reasonable to assume there are many more cases of this than we know about, and we want to learn more,' Prof Loehr said. 'Any time you have infection of a virus into a new species, it’s a concern, a black box of uncertainty. We don’t know for sure what the implications might be, but we do think this deserves more attention.' Natural and experimental transmission of the H3N2 influenza virus from dogs to cats in South Korea showed the potential for flu viruses to be transmitted among various animal species, Prof Loehr said. It’s unknown if an infected cat or other pet could pass influenza back to humans. The primary concern in 'reverse zoonosis,' is that in any new movement of a virus from one species to another, the virus might mutate into a more virulent, harmful or easily transmissible form.","A total of 13 cats and one dog in the U.S are believed to have caught the H1N1 virus in 2011 and 2012 from their owners .

"Mariafrancesca Garritano reveals details of anorexia . Revelations may cost her place in opening performance . Dancers tormented by eating disorders to get 'perfect body' By . Nick Pisa . UPDATED: . 22:04 EST, 4 February 2012 . A leading ballerina has risked the wrath of theatre chiefs by blowing the lid on the dark secrets of the ballet world including details of anorexia and women unable to have children as a result. In scenes that would not look out of place in the Natalie Portman Oscar winning blockbuster Black Swan, ballerina Mariafrancesca Garritano, 33, has broken the unwritten code of silence - which she fears could cost her a place in the opening performance of next season. Dropped: Mariafrancesca Garritano risked the wrath of theatre chiefs by blowing the lid on the dark secrets of the ballet world . Miss Garritano, a ballerina at Milan's famous La Scala opera house, described how dancers were tormented with eating disorders such as anorexia and bulimia, as they frantically tried to please teachers and opera chiefs with 'the perfect body.' She added: 'Sadly this is a phenomenon that affects the whole of the ballet world but is very rarely discussed - it's as if there is a Mafia code of omerta (silence) that rules over us and as it result it must never be broken. 'Dancers are having their bodies taken to the limit by teachers and theatre directors who are demanding that the dancers have the perfect body and as such this is a sore that needs to be treated. Black Swan: The pressures of life as a ballerina were highlighted in the film starring Natalie Portman . Ballet and the world of dance is a beautiful form of art that should not be exploited and put the lives of ballerinas and dancers at risk. One in five dancers in the ballet world are victims of anorexia - even La Scala is not immune. Miss Garritano, who spoke after rehearsals at La Scala for next month's opening performance of Excelsior, added: 'This message needs to get out there - the people in the industry know the problem exists and the thought that I may be victimised for speaking out has crossed my mind but I hope it does not come to that. I have personal experience of this problem - when I was a young teenager I suffered from anorexia and my weight dropped to 43 kilos (6.8stone). I didn't think I was fat but the teachers kept telling me I needed to lose weight or I would not get selected for performances. Eating disorder: Natalie Portman's character in the Black Swan is sick after eating a slice of cake . 'For eighteen months I did not have my period and even know I suffer from intestinal problems which I am sure are all connected to my experiences as a teenager. Lots of dancers I know cannot conceive because of the problems they had with anorexia.' She added: 'It is not unusual to hear ballerinas talk of how they had two crackers for breakfast, a yoghurt for lunch and an apple for dinner just to make sure they can fit into their tutus. I know dancers who would compete against each other to see how little they could eat which is lunacy. 'They resort to this extreme course of action because they are being told that if they don't lose weight then they will not get picked.' Earlier this year former Strictly Come Dancing judge Arlene Phillips also spoke of the pressures that dancers faced and highlighted the scene in Black Swan where Natalie Portman's Nina is sick after eating a slice of cake to celebrate winning a part in Swan Lake. Arlene said: 'Staying slender is obviously a big part of a dancer's life,' turning to the cake scene she added: 'Initially she refuses to eat it and when she finally has a tiny bite, you can see the distaste on her face. She knows in a few days time she has to fit into a tutu, which has been measured to fit her exactly. she has to abstain.' No one from La Scala opera house was available to comment on the revelations . Miss Garrittano added: 'I have never actually seen people being sick after eating but I know ballerinas who have suffered from eating disorders and then gone on to have psycological problems as well. I saw the film Black Swan and it was not very far from the truth at all but this problem is not restricted to dancing it is in fashion as well.' Miss Garrittano has written about her experiences in a book called 'The Truth, Please, About Ballet' and added: 'When you see ballerinas on stage perfectly combed and immaculately dressed no-one can imagine that behind these people are stories of corruption and threats in order to keep their places in the company.' No-one from La Scala was available to comment.","Mariafrancesca Garritano reveals details of anorexia .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 03:43 EST, 2 September 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 04:42 EST, 2 September 2012 . Norwegian mass murderer Anders Breivik has been hailed 'inspirational' and a 'role model' by a number of British rightwing extremists. A week after Breivik was convicted and jailed for the murder of 77 people in Oslo last year, a string of messages have appeared on Facebook, posted by members of the English Defence League (EDL) and the National Front, praising the 33-year-old's deadly rampage. In one disturbing post, Breivik is said to have 'sacrificed his life' to free Europe from the 'clutches of Islam... multiculturalism and political correctness'. The respected French writer has claimed mass killer . Anders Breivik (pictured) was 'without doubt what Norway deserves' English Defence League: EDL members clash with the police during a riot in Bradford . The comment was made by a NF supporter. The man, who uses the alias Daz MarxistHunter, appealed to friends on the site to sign a petition to free Breivik - who is serving a 21-year sentence. His message added: '(He) is inspirational.... 'I see him as my role model, . what every European man needs to be in order for Europe to survive.' Anders Breivik is planning to publish a tell-all book about his massacre from behind bars. The 33-year-old has already started writing the autiobiography, which will reportedly focus on his life from 2002, when he began his 'crusade', and a blow-by-blow account of his attack on the Norwegian capital Oslo in July 2011. Breivik's lawyer Tord Jordet said:'He is under no illusion that the book will ever be published in Norway but there has been a lot of interest from publishers in southern Europe.' Another man, a member of a 'Christian resistance' group called Order 777, also posted support for Breivik online - particularly the murder of eight people he killed in a bomb attack on a government building in the capital. The man insisted he deserved a medal 'for the groundbreaking performance to blow up his Marxist traitor government building'. After the bomb attack, Breivik went on a shooting spree on the island of Utoya, where a group of teenagers had gathered for a youth camp. He killed 69 of them before he was arrested. A court last month declared him sane and sentenced him to 21 years in jail, the maximum sentence allowed by Norwegian law. EDL leader Stephen Lennon insisted his organisation was against violence and that Breivik's actions 'were obviously wrong' - but he accused the court of legitimising the killer's motives, by finding him sane. He said: 'By saying that he was sane, it gives a certain credibility to what he had been saying. And that is that Islam is a threat to Europe and to the rest of the world.' Another EDL member went as far as revealing he had written to Breivik in prison, writing: 'I have wrote letters to him in prison and he seems he is in high spirits.' The wave of support for Breivik has concerned one anti-extremist group - Hope Not Hate - whose leader insists the UK isn't immune from a similar attack. Nick Lowles told the Observer: 'Sadly, there are many others at large who share his warped ideology. Seventeen people in the UK with far-right views have been imprisoned in . recent years for terrorist-related offences,' The Facebook support comes just days after a French author sparked controversy . after saying that Norwegian mass killer Anders Behring Breivik is . 'without doubt what Norway deserves'. French writer Richard Millet sparked controversy for claiming Norwegian mass killer Anders Behring Breivik, whom he described as 'without doubt what Norway deserves' Richard Millet, who says he has read . all 1,500 pages of Breivik’s online manifesto in which the Norwegian . lays out his world view, insists that he does not approve of the . gunman’s crimes. However, . the respected writer and editor praised Breivik’s writing and cry of . hatred for social democracy, immigration and multi-culturalism. 'Breivik is without doubt what Norway deserves,' wrote Millet in an 18-page pamphlet. He . is 'as much a child of a broken family as of an ideological and racial . fracture caused by immigration from outside Europe over the last 20 . years', added Millet, who has edited several award-winning books in . France. His writing about . Breivik has sparked consternation in the literary circles, with one . author Annie Ernaux calling the text 'a politically dangerous act'. Another author Tahar Ben Jelloun said: 'He has lost his head.' Others were less critical. 'He . is still my editor,' said Alexis Jenni. 'I don’t want to take any . public position on the subject. Millet believes only in literature. 'He is someone who writes marvellously well. His questionable ideas do not reduce his literary qualities,' he argued. In a manifesto he published online . before the attacks, Breivik wrote that 'patriotic resistance fighters' should use trials 'as a platform to further our cause'. Carnage: The aftermath of the Oslo car bomb planted by mass killer Breivik . Blast: The bomb at the high-rise government building left scores injured last year . He claimed to be part of a secret . organisation modelled on the medieval Christian military order the . Knights Templar, which aimed to purge Europe of Muslim influence. Police found no trace of the organisation, however, and said he acted alone. The document laid out a blueprint for . a multi-phase 'revolution', targeting left-leaning political elites he . accused of destroying their own societies by admitting large numbers of . immigrants, especially from Muslim countries. The document spelt out Breivik's . extreme nationalist philosophy as well as his methods. It described how . he bought guns, tons of fertiliser and other bomb components, hid . collections of weapons and evaded police suspicion in the run-up to the . attacks. CCTV: Surveillance footage shows Breivik, dressed in . police uniform and carrying a pistol, as he walks away from a car after . placing a bomb in Oslo last year . Force: This photo shows members of the Norwegian Special Forces land by boat on the shore of the island of Utoya during Breivik's shooting spree . Before the killings, Breivik spent much of his time absorbed in online gaming, mostly playing the World of Warcraft series. He was a high school dropout and, the . court heard, made money by forging diplomas and certificates under the . company name Diplom Service, which folded in 2006. He released a YouTube video six hours before the attacks calling for conservatives to 'embrace martyrdom'. It included pictures of him wearing a wetsuit and pointing an automatic weapon. In a text with the video he detailed . his plans for the attacks, writing that he would 'dress up as a police . officer', adding that it would 'be awesome as people will be . astonished'. Chilling: Breivik walks with a gun among the bodies strewn around Utoya island during his rampage last July . Terror: Teenagers on the Norwegian holiday island of Utoya had to 'swim for their lives' and hide in trees when Breivik fired indiscriminately at them . In the wake of the attacks, anxious to prove he was not insane, Breivik called right-wing extremists and radical Islamists to give their public support for his view of clashing civilizations. It was widely reported that he had made postings on British nationalist websites. But Norwegian authorities said there was no evidence of links to the English far-right. Breivik derided a jail term as . 'pathetic', and said acquittal or execution were the only reasonable . outcomes, although the country does not have the death penalty. Breivik's rampage began when eight people were killed after his car bomb exploded at the high-rise Norwegian government headquarters in Oslo at 3.26pm. It left a dust-clogged square covered in twisted metal and shattered glass. Police . described it as an 'Oklahoma city-type' bombing, perpetrated by a . home-grown assailant and using the same mix of fertiliser and fuel that . blew up a building in the U.S. in 1995. The . bomb was packed into a panel truck outside the building. An . agricultural supplier said Breivik bought six tonnes of fertiliser in . the weeks before the explosion. But . as police battled to deal with the effects of the bomb, a much more . deadly attack was about to begin 20 miles north-west of the capital. Breivik, . dressed as a policeman, drove to a lake outside the capital and took a . ferry to the island of Utoya, where hundreds of young people were . attending a summer camp organised by the youth wing of the Labour Party. At . around 4.50pm he opened fire, claiming another 69 lives. It is claimed . that he beckoned to his young victims before shooting them one by one. Survivors of the shooting spree described hiding and fleeing into the water to escape. Police . arrived on the island an hour and a half after the gunman first opened . fire, because they did not have quick access to a helicopter and could . not find a boat to reach the scene just several hundred yards away. When . the armed officers did locate a boat they overloaded it, causing it to . break down. Breivik surrendered when officers finally reached him on . Utoya at 6.35pm. Oslo . police director Oeystein Maeland said later: 'I regret we weren't able . to arrest the suspect earlier than we did. Could police have been . faster? The answer is yes. 'If . the boat hadn't been over capacity, police would have been on Utoya . faster. If it would have led to another and better result is nothing we . know for sure, but we can't rule it out. 'And it's tough, like I've said before, to think that lives thereby would have been saved.' Chilling . accounts soon emerged of what happened at the camp. A 15-year-old, . Elise, said she heard gunshots but then saw a police officer and thought . she was safe. Then the . man started shooting people in front of her. She said: 'I saw many dead . people. He first shot people on the island. Afterwards he started . shooting people in the water.' Dana . Berzingi, 21, said several victims 'had pretended they were dead to . survive'. But after shooting them with one gun, he blasted them in the . head with a shotgun, he added.",National Front and EDL members praise mass killer and petition for his release .

Information released under Freedom of Information laws shows that Ofcom, the communications watchdog, has spent £9.4million making workers redundant over the past five years. But over the same period it has hired 598 staff – more than twice the 223 who have been let go. London headquarters: Information shows Ofcom, the communications watchdog, has spent £9.4million making workers redundant over the past five years . There is increasing concern over the costs of making thousands of civil servants and quangocrats redundant. As much as £1million a day has been spent on generous payments to departing bureaucrats, the vast majority of whom have taken voluntary redundancy. Research suggests that nearly half of all departments are increasing their headcount, despite the Government’s pledge to freeze public sector recruitment. Freedom of Information requests to Ofcom by the TaxPayers’ Alliance campaign group will heighten suspicions that savings are being wiped out as more staff are taken on. They showed that in 2010-11, the organisation made 148 staff redundant, but it hired 153 staff the next year. And in 2011-12, Ofcom rehired two members of staff it had previously made redundant, taking one back permanently and another on a fixed-term contract. In total, the quango employs around 735 people and over the past five financial years – 2007-08 to 2011-12 – it has spent £19.2million on temporary staff. Matthew Sinclair, chief executive of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘Poor planning by Ofcom has left taxpayers needlessly footing a redundancy and recruitment bill of millions. Chief: The 2012/13 budget for Ofcom - run by Ed Richards, a former member of Tony Blair's policy unit, on a salary of almost £400,000 - is £121.4million . ‘The Government is failing to deliver on its promised recruitment freeze both at this quango and across Whitehall. ‘Redundancies and their subsequent pay-outs impose a large short-term cost on taxpayers, yet taking on new staff a year later will wipe out any savings that could have been created.’ 'Poor planning by Ofcom has left taxpayers needlessly footing a redundancy and recruitment bill of millions. The Government is failing to deliver on its promised recruitment freeze both at this quango and across Whitehall' Matthew Sinclair, TaxPayers’ Alliance chief executive . Ofcom said some short-term roles had been created ‘to help ensure the smooth running of wireless communications for the Olympic and Paralympic Games’. But Mr Sinclair said: ‘Ofcom should have used existing staff to cover any increased Olympic duties before going through this costly firing and hiring process. ‘It’s deeply worrying that the regulator in charge of communications can’t be trusted in its stewardship of taxpayers’ money.’ The 2012/13 budget for Ofcom – which is run by Ed Richards, a former member of Tony Blair’s policy unit, on a salary of almost £400,000 – is £121.4million. By 2014/15, Ofcom says it will deliver a 28.2 per cent real terms reduction in its expenditure and says increases in staff costs result from its redundancy programme, not an increase in salaries. It has also insisted many employees have left voluntarily, leading to an overall fall in its headcount. A spokesman said: ‘Ofcom is in the middle of a four-year programme that will deliver 28.2 per cent real-term savings by 2014/15. ‘Overall, staff numbers have fallen in recent years, from an average 789 in 2007 to 735 in 2012 – this is in spite of new duties recently granted to Ofcom, such as regulating postal services and helping to reduce online copyright infringement.’","Ofcom hired more than twice number of staff it let go .

A teenage ballet dancer was fighting for his life today - and feared paralysed from the neck down - after being mugged in a street attack. Talented Jack Widdowson, 19, suffered a suspected broken neck in the brutal late-night assault. His family at his hospital bedside have been told that Jack may never dance again after the attack in which his iPhone was taken. Talented: Ballet dancer Jack Widdowson, 19, is fighting for his life after being mugged in Cardiff. A member of a ballet company in Bern, Switzerland, he was visiting his student brother in Cardiff when he was attacked walking home from a night out . Jack is in a critical condition at the University Hospital of Wales with his family at his bedside . Jack, a member of a ballet company . in Bern, Switzerland, was visiting his student brother in Cardiff when . he was attacked walking home from a night out. He was in the city's docks area when it’s believed his attacker ‘befriended him’ - and showed him a short cut alongside a canal. Police say Jack was attacked moments later by the same man on the canal towpath. Other late-night revellers found him unconscious more than an hour later and dialled 999. Detective Chief Inspector Andy Davies, . of South Wales Police, said: 'This is an appalling assault while . Jack was out with his brother. 'They became separated when he was . walking home when he was joined by an unknown man. 'He was attacked and . his iPhone was stolen and is still missing' Jack was yesterday in a critical condition at the University Hospital of Wales with his family at his bedside. His father Dr Julian Widdowson is head of sports medicine at Premiership rugby club Bath. A family friend said: ‘Jack is a lovely and gentle young man - we are praying he is going to pull through.’ Jack's family, including his parents Julian and Celia, his sister and two brothers, are at his bedside. His brother Mark, 21, is a student in Cardiff and had been a semi-professional rugby player in France. Detective Inspector Shane Ahmed said: ‘This incident is appalling and a full investigation is under way to catch the person responsible. ‘Our thoughts are with the family of the victim, who are being supported by a trained family liaison officer at this difficult time. ‘Although the assault happened during the early hours of the morning, there may have been a number of people out, on their way to or from Cardiff city centre. ‘We're appealing for anyone with information to come forward.’ Police want to speak to a man described as of mixed race and wearing a white-striped polo shirt with a dark-coloured motif on the left breast, blue jeans and white trainers. Inspector Ahmed added: ‘I'm urging anyone who may have witnessed the pair walking in the early hours of Saturday morning. ‘We also want to hear from anyone who spoke to someone matching the description of this man in the nearby area, to contact us immediately.’ Jack, of Farmborough, near Bath, Somerset, started dancing in his early teens and later graduated from Tring Park School for the Performing Arts in Hertfordshire. He went on to perform with London-based contemporary ballet the AD Dance Company and later became an apprentice dancer at Bern Ballet in Switzerland. Jack had flown back to Britain from Switzerland after making a successful premier in the lead role of his ballet company the night before. His doctor father came back with him after his show success and said yesterday: 'We were so proud to see him the day before the attack. 'He left school in August and was thrilled to have been chosen as one of the youngest ever members of Bern Ballet Dance Company where he had the privilege to dance one of the lead roles in the company's winter production.' Dr Widdowson said the family had messages of support and good wishes from across the world. He said: 'This is a huge comfort to Jack and all the family as he fights for his life. 'We are all appalled by this unprovoked mindless violent attack in this great city where I was born. 'We continue to be by Jack's bedside hoping and praying for recovery.' Dr Widdowson said his son was a 'determined and strong-willed boy' who had worked hard to make the best of his natural talents. He said: 'Jack is a very entertaining person who is very well loved by all who know and work with him. He has a polite and easy manner with a great sense of humour. 'Jack has always been a good sportsman and represented his school hockey and rugby where he played prop. 'Jack has always been physically, mentally and emotionally strong which enabled him to pursue a career in dance. 'It also helped to survive a near-fatal episode of bacterial meningitis three years ago, then make a complete recovery, persevering with a punishing programme of rehab exercises.' Jack left Tring Park School in June after studying science A-levels and a vocational course in dance. He was school prizes for contemporary dance and choreography. Dr Widdowson added: ""We would like to thank the member of the public who found him and made the 999 call. We would also like to thank all the dedicated professionals involved in his care."" In 2008 his father noticed he had a chest rash at home and immediately diagnosed meningitis. In an interview earlier this year Dr Widdowson said: ‘Jack had been at a party the night before. ‘At first, when Jack said he felt ill in the morning I just thought maybe he had overindulged at the party and told him to take a couple of paracetamol. ‘His brother Mark was home so I told him to keep an eye on him. ‘Mark then rang to say Jack was talking nonsense so I decided to drive home. I went upstairs and discovered he'd been sick. ‘He just didn't look right and when I saw a rash on his chest I knew it was meningitis.' Dr Widdowson rang 999 and gave Jack penicillin. Jack suffered from cardiac failure and went into respiratory arrest and had to be resuscitated. The family was given bereavement counselling in the expectation that Jack would not make it. Three months later Jack had recovered, except for a slight tremor in his upper limbs, which he was able to control through dancing. Dr Widdowson described his son as a ‘determined young man with the ambition, strength of character and talent to succeed’.","Family told Jack Widdowson, 19, may never dance again .

Clint Eastwood says his bizarre speech to an empty chair at the Republican National Convention was precisely what the GOP deserved for being 'dumb enough' to invite him to speak at a political rally. The Hollywood legend, 82, says he was simply having fun during the head-scratching prime time performance, which became the most memorable moment from either Democratic or Republican conventions. Eastwood also revealed his inspiration came from a speech he gave at a friend's funeral in which he played out scenes of his dead pal having conversations with 'mythic characters.' Scroll down to watch the interview . Just desserts: Clint Eastwood says the Republicans should have expected such a bizarre performance . In an interview with entertainment TV show Extra, Eastwood was unapologetic about his August 30 performance at the RNC in Tampa, Florida. 'People loved it or hated it, and that’s fine. I was just having fun. I figure if somebody’s dumb enough to ask me to go to a political convention and say something, they’re gonna have to take what they get,' he said. Eastwood, who describes his politics as socially liberal and fiscally conservative, is a Mitt Romney supporter and says he has met the Republican presidential candidate and will bring 'business sense' to the White House. Eastwood has been talking about the performance as part of a publicity tour for his new film 'Trouble with the Curve.' He appeared on the Ellen DeGeneres' talk show and said he was libertarian and supports gay marriage. Memorable: About 30 million Americans watched Eastwood's discussion with a chair -- and it became an instant Internet sensation . 'The condition of society right now, with the high unemployment rates and the tremendous debt we're increasing and the government spending, we'd think there'd be more to think about than worrying about gay marriage,' he said. He also told Ellen that most people thought he was 'going senile' over the RNC speech. Eastwood says it was Romney's 'people,' not the former governor himself, who asked Eastwood to speak at the convention. For 11 and a half minutes, directly before Romney's official nomination acceptance speech at the RNC, Eastwood address and empty chair that he pretended was President Barack Obama. Thirty million Americans watched as he ad-libbed a conversation with the imaginary president. At least twice, Eastwood implied that Obama responded to his questions with profanities. The strange speech became an Internet sensation and was lampooned in a series of memes. But even most Republicans were left scratching their heads over the performance. Still, Eastwood says he would probably do the same thing if given the opportunity to make the unscripted speech it all over again. Eastwood, who rose to fame playing a tough guy in films like 'Dirty Harry' and 'The Good, the Bad and the Ugly,' says he stole the inspiration from the speech from himself. 'Actually, I did a funeral speech for a friend of mine and I started talking to mythical people imitating him,' he told Extra.","Legendary actor and director says inspiration came from a speech he made at a friend's funeral .

Thieves stole £12,000 in jewellery from a disabled man after he met them on Facebook and invited them to play video games with him at his parents' house while he was home alone. Paul Miller, 28, who has cerebral palsy and uses a wheelchair, has been left traumatised by his ordeal after the two men stole from his house in Bickerstaffe, Lancashire, after spending weeks speaking to him on the social networking site. After arriving at the house, one of the men went upstairs, taking jewellery and about £250 in cash, an iPad and an iPod, while the other kept Mr Miller in one room. Traumatised: Paul Miller, who has cerebral palsy and uses a wheelchair, invited two men he had befriended on Facebook round to play PlayStation but when they arrived they stole £12,000 in jewellery from the house . Mr Miller’s mother Lorraine and stepfather Marty Heggarty returned home to find him in a state of shock and thousands of pounds worth of items gone. She said: ‘Paul was very distressed. We had to take him to hospital after it had happened. It’s quite remote where we live and Paul uses Facebook to chat to people and make friends. ‘He’d been talking to two lads from Kirkby and while we were out shopping he asked if they wanted to come round and play on the PlayStation with him. ‘I think when they realised he was on his own they got a taxi up here straight away. ‘When they got to the house one of the men asked to use the toilet. Paul could hear him walking upstairs even though the bathroom is next door to his room. Took advantage: Mr Miller had spent weeks speaking to the two men on Facebook before the incident. His stepfather Marty Heggarty said they knew he was disabled and that they had 'taken advantage of Paul' ‘When Paul asked the other one what he was doing he kept Paul in the room and wouldn’t let him out. He was stuck in there for about 10 minutes then the man came back and they just left.’ Mr Heggarty said the men knew Mr Miller was disabled. He said: ‘He’d been talking to these lads on Facebook for a couple of weeks and they knew he was disabled. They have just taken advantage of Paul.’ Since his traumatic experience, Mr Miller has lost all his confidence. Changed personality: Since the incident, Mr Miller does not want to be home alone . Mr Heggarty said: ‘He won’t go out unless we’re with him and he doesn’t want to be in the house on his own. ‘It has changed his personality. His confidence has gone. ‘Paul does voluntary work three days a week but now we have to make sure someone’s in the house when he gets back because he doesn’t want to be here alone. ‘Paul’s stepbrother died on September 3. They were the same age and had grown up together. His stepbrother had an accident three years ago and had been living in hospital but we used to go and see him regularly. ‘Paul was devastated when he died and now this has happened and it has set him back again.’ A spokeswoman for Lancashire Police said a 19-year-old man from the Kirkby area had been arrested and bailed in connection with the incident. Mr Heggarty said some of the jewellery had sentimental value and was irreplaceable. He said: ‘A lot of the things they took had sentimental value. They stole watches that belonged to my wife’s father, who died before Christmas. ‘Now we’ve been told by our insurance company we were under-insured so we’ll probably be lucky to get a third of the value back.’ The police are appealing for anyone with information to contact police.","Paul Miller invited the two men to his home after he met them on Facebook .

The widow of a businessman gunned down outside a suburban Atlanta preschool has pleaded not guilty to helping plot her husband's death. Andrea Sneiderman was arraigned Monday in an Atlanta-area court on a variety of charges, including malice murder and criminal attempt to commit murder. Sneiderman was arrested in August and accused of conspiring with her former boss, Hemy Neuman, to kill her husband, Russell 'Rusty' Sneiderman. The case has captured a national . audience ever since the woman's lover, Hemy Neuman, told jurors at the . time of his trial that he was convinced that he should kill his lover's . husband Russell Sneiderman by an angel in a dream who supposedly looked . like actress Olivia Newton John. Scroll down for video . Not Guilty? Andrea Sneiderman appears at an arraignment hearing Monday, Oct. 8, 2012 in DeKalb County Superior Court in Decatur, Georgia . Torn apart: Russell Sneiderman was murdered after dropping his children off at daycare. His wife, Andrea, right, has plead guilty for her alleged part in the murder . Lovers turned fighters: Andrea Sneiderman (left) was apparently having an affair with her then-boss Hemy Neuman (right) when he shot and killed her husband Rusty . He was gunned down just after dropping off their son at preschool in 2010. Neuman admitted to the killing and was sentenced in March to life in prison, but Sneiderman has denied involvement in the murder. She was charged with malice murder, criminal attempt to commit murder, racketeering, perjury and insurance fraud in late August, but released on bond but placed under house arrest and has been living with her parents in Roswell. The prosecutor declined to answer . questions about the evidence against Sneiderman, but the 19-page . indictment alleged that she conspired with Neuman, who was her boss at . the time of the slaying. 'Neuman . and Andrea Sneiderman conspired together to murder Rusty Sneiderman so . that they could enjoy a life together, eliminate Neuman's debt problems . and fully benefit from the assets the Sneidermans had acquired as well . as the proceeds of Rusty Sneiderman's life insurance policies,' the . indictment said.

Sorrow: Don Sneiderman, left, reacts after the reading of the verdict of the Hemy Neuman trial in the DeKalb County Courthouse Thursday, March 15, 2012 in Decatur, Ga. At right, Sneiderman attends her bond hearing . The indictment also alleged Andrea Sneiderman gave Neuman her husband's schedule 'so that Neuman could kill Rusty Sneiderman.' Sneiderman's attorneys issued a statement reiterating her innocence and promising a vigorous defense 'to ensure that Andrea is fully exonerated of these false accusations.' Her attorneys include J. Tom Morgan, who spent 12 years as the DeKalb County district attorney. The Sneiderman family said in a statement that her arrest brought no joy but called it 'another important step in pursuit of justice for Rusty.' Unusual urgings: During his trial, Neuman said that an angel who looked like Olivia Newton John told him to do it, as did a demon who sounded like Barry White . Prosecutors said they presented a case to a grand jury, and jurors returned the indictment less than two hours later. When asked why prosecutors were pursuing the case now, the district attorney said: 'Now is because we are ready now. If we were ready three months ago, it would have been three months ago. If it was last year when we charged Mr. Neuman, it would have been then.' Sneiderman was arrested at a home in . Putnam County and was being held without bond. Details of an initial . court appearance were not immediately available. Happier times: Relatives of Rusty Sneiderman (right) said that they long-suspected Andrea (left) was involved with his murder . Earlier, WSB-TV aired footage of Sneiderman dressed in khaki shorts and a long-sleeve shirt surrounded by law enforcement officials as she left the house, was handcuffed and placed in a patrol car. During Neuman's trial, prosecutors suggested Andrea Sneiderman was a 'co-conspirator' in the slaying, goading a love-struck Neuman into killing her husband, perhaps for a $2million life insurance policy. Neuman also told mental health examiners he was visited by a demon whose voice sounded like Barry White and an angel who looked like Olivia Newton-John. The angel ordered him to fatally shoot Sneiderman, Neuman said in one interview. Andrea Sneiderman repeatedly denied an affair and denied knowing anything about the shooting. After the trial, Neuman's defense attorneys and Russell Sneiderman's family said they hoped that prosecutors would investigate Andrea Sneiderman in the killing. At the time, Russell Sneiderman's brother, Steve, said the family long suspected Andrea was involved in his death, and the trial only confirmed their suspicions.","Andrea Sneiderman is charged with helping her lover murder her husband .

An ‘unfashionable’ Edwardian painting bought at Harrods for £100 was revealed to be a missing masterpiece that has sold for an incredible £380,000. The oil painting by English artist John Godward was purchased as an ‘impulse buy’ by a canny collector in 1957 who bought it at a reduced price as it was deemed unfashionable. Art expert Richard Kay was shocked when he identified the 1909 painting by Godward that had been missing from the art world since 1937. Missing masterpiece: A woman from Somerset bought this painting by John Godward, entitled 'Summer Idleness; Day Dreams,' for £100 in 1957. Today it sold at auction for £380,000 . Godward’s works have become incredibly popular in recent times and so today at auction the work, which measures 20x30in, sold for £320,000 plus £60,000 of fees to an anonymous London dealer. The unidentified woman from Somerset loved the painting, of a wistful-looking woman sitting on a marbled seat, until her death in 1979 when it was inherited by her daughter. The daughter, who did not like the painting quite as much, decided to sell it at auction. The family who sold the painting, entitled ‘Summer Idleness; Day Dreams,’ attended the auction at Lawrences Auctioneers in Crewkerne, Somerset and were ‘very happy’ with the price. Mr Kay said: ‘The vendor’s mother bought it at Harrods in London in 1957 on impulse. ‘Now, 55 years later, her good eye has led to her family receiving this vast amount of money for it. ‘The family were very happy with the price. It is a sum of money that will make a great deal of difference to their lives. ‘Godward would have been astonished by the price. Even his very finest works were making just £150 during his lifetime, which equates with barely £10,000 in today’s money.’ Tragically, Godward committed suicide . in 1922 by putting his head in a gas oven when he feared that modern . art by artists such as Picasso were making his style of work obsolete. Mr Kay said: ‘This picture was last recorded when it sold at auction in London in 1937. ‘Up until now scholars only knew of the picture from a 1910 print. Canny collector: The woman bought the artwork at Harrods (pictured) on impulse but she died in 1979, leaving the painting to her daughter who decided to sell it . ‘I suspect that after it sold at auction the owner couldn’t sell it because nobody wanted it and gave it to Harrods to sell for him. ‘The owner’s mother was very keen on art but didn’t have a great deal of money to spend on it. ‘On a visit to see her sister who lived in west London in 1957, she went in to Harrods and was bowled over by the quality of this painting. ‘It is a Victorian picture in style which was really out of fashion in the 1950s. ‘Against the opinion of the art world she acted on impulse and paid a not inconsiderable amount of money for it. ‘£100 in 1957 was worth about £2,000 today but even in the late 1970s this picture would have been worth barely £5,000.’ The owner used to hang the painting on her wall but took it down for safekeeping after realising Godward’s works were becoming valuable. The painting was either painted in Greece or Italy where Godward spent a lot of his time as an artist. It shows a buxom woman wearing a flimsy purple dress sitting with her legs up on a marble seat.","The painting by artist John Godward sold today at Lawrences Auctioneers .

A secretive Chinese company that was accused last week of posing a threat to America's national security is being investigated over a controversial £2.5 billion deal with British Telecom. The inquiry by an influential group of MPs is understood to have been sparked by concerns raised by spymasters over the growth in cyber attacks emanating from China. At the centre of the inquiry is China's biggest telecommunication corporation, Huawei, which has a contract with BT to play a leading role in a £2.5 billion plan to roll out super-fast broadband to two-thirds of UK homes and offices by 2015. Fears: The inquiry into Huawei is understood to have been sparked by spymasters . Malcolm Rifkind, chairman of the Security and Intelligence Committee, told The Mail on Sunday that his report would be with the Prime Minister by the end of the year and would include evidence gathered about the involvement of the Government in the seven-year relationship between BT and Huawei. The findings could be deeply embarrassing for David Cameron, who only last month personally endorsed Huawei's business in the UK when he met Ren Zhengfei, the  company's president. The US House of Representatives Intelligence Committee last week accused Huawei and ZTE, another Chinese company, of leaving the US open to espionage and cyber attack. Last year, Britain's most senior trade official was at the centre of a row after landing a lucrative job with the controversial Chinese telecoms giant. Sir Andrew Cahn, former head of UK Trade & Investment, was appointed chairman of the UK advisory board of Huawei. The Security and Intelligence Committee is already looking at the cyber threat posed by Russia and China, which are suspected of carrying out the majority of electronic attacks against UK interests. Involved: David Cameron met Huawei CEO Ren Zhengfei last month . Security chiefs are understood to be most worried about how foreign telecoms companies might be able to damage or control UK infras­tructure should their home states have hostile intentions against British interests. A BT spokesman said: 'We work closely with Huawei on commercial security best practice and our relationship is managed strictly in accordance with UK laws.' A Huawei spokesman said the company had worked with the Government to create a 'rigorous and sophisticated assurance system for telecoms equipment regularly tested by government security experts'.","Huawei is being investigated over contract with BT to play a leading role in super-fast broadband roll out .

A woman who lied to police that she had been knocked down by a van on a zebra crossing in an attempt to secure a compensation payout has avoided jail. Kayleigh Taylor, 26, was almost clipped by the van as she was approaching the crossing in June 2011. But she used the opportunity to hatch a plan to make money, and instantly rang police pretending the van had knocked her over. Taylor then compounded her lies by feigning a leg injury and calling paramedics to her house after she 'managed to hobble home'. Liar: Kayleigh Taylor instantly rang police after pretending to be hit by a van on a zebra crossing . But in reality the mother-of-one, from Guidepost, Northumberland, was completely unharmed. Newcastle Crown Court heard how . Taylor, quickly got in contact with her solicitor, putting in a personal . injury claim the very next day after the incident, as police tried to . track down the mystery van driver. Taylor's deceit only became apparent after she was exposed when CCTV was recovered from two passing buses at the scene of the make-believe accident. Mark Styles, prosecuting, said: 'Taylor told police a white van continued onto the crossing, she tried to get out of the way and stepped back but it struck her on her left knee and she was knocked onto the road. Walking free: Taylor has been handed a three-month jail sentence suspended for a year with supervision . 'She claimed someone had stopped to help her, that she was in considerable pain, and had managed to hobble home.' Taylor admitted perverting justice in June last year. She was handed a three-month jail sentence suspended for a year with supervision on Monday, October 1. Recorder Slater told her: 'I have no difficulty in reaching the conclusion the custodial threshold has been passed. 'But having regard to your previous good character, that you were under considerable pressure at the time, and that custody would have disastrous consequences for you, your five-year-old son and your accommodation, it seems to me the most appropriate sentence is to suspend that term of imprisonment.' It was brought to light that Taylor was out of work at the time of the incident. Graham O’Sullivan, defending, said the lies that followed had 'got out of control'. He said: 'The van driver did drive onto the zebra crossing when she was about halfway across but that does not justify the exaggeration she subsequently perpetrated. 'It’s clear she was soon having second thoughts. She was not persistent in pressing the civil claim for compensation.' Taylor 'claimed someone had stopped to help her, that she was in considerable pain, and had managed to hobble home.'","Woman faked being hit by van on zebra crossing trying to claim compensation .

Chocolate lovers across Europe are giving up their favourite snack as the financial crisis eats into their pay packets. The addictive and relatively affordable treat was once thought recession-proof, but now families are abandoning Kit-Kats and Curly Wurlys in their droves. Western Europe's chocolate market value is set to fall by around five per cent for 2012, according to food and drink analysts Mintel. Sweet stuff: Chocaholics in Western Europe are going cold turkey, with the market apparently at saturation point (file picture) Researchers Nielsen estimate that its value will have plummeted to around $30billion, from . $31.7billion the previous year. Nielsen's Jean-Jacques Vandenheede said this was surprising because 'chocolate usually does better than . average fast moving consumer goods.' 'Chocolate is the archetype of . cheap indulgence so it's the last thing people will drop,' he added. Portugal and Italy will see some of the . sharpest falls in market value in Western Europe for 2012, Mintel . forecast, at -11 per cent and -7 per cent respectively. It is the first drop in the market since the firm began recording volume for the consumer goods sector in 2007. 'For the first part of the recession we . thought chocolate would be recession proof, and then we said recession . resistant, and now I think people are just getting ground down,' said . Marcia Mogelonsky from Mintel. Just nuts: The market value has fallen by five per cent this year, analysts predict, although rises in Asia and the Americas have kept chocolate sales steady on a global level . 'I have not seen this much of a slowing in the market in the time I've been watching it. 'If the economic outlook continues to be . as sombre as it is now people are not going to rally, they are going to . hunker down even more, and spend even less on food, even on chocolate.' European cocoa traders said slowing . chocolate demand and poor cocoa processing margins triggered the resale . of cocoa beans by major processors last month. Cocoa futures on Liffe this week fell to their lowest level since July 25. Double-digit sales in the Americas, Asia . and eastern Europe have helped offset sluggish demand in southern . Europe, however, according to the world's largest chocolate products maker Barry Callebaut. Mintel data showed the bright spots for . growth were in emerging markets in Asia including China, Indonesia and . Vietnam - but these countries were starting from a low base. It has meant that the value of the chocolate market globally will be little changed on last year, at $84.5billion for 2012. China's market value is expected to . increase by 16 per cent in 2012 to $4.6bn, while Vietnam will be up 11 . per cent at $170m and Indonesia was up nine per cent to $1.2bn, . according to Mintel figures.

A family with seven children who are facing eviction from . their foreclosed home say they have found the . money to buy it back - but the bank is refusing to sell it until it has heard other potential offers. Jeanette and Bill Gearing, from Helen, Georgia, claim the bank wants them to leave the house as it would grant them five days in which to accept . outside offers, potentially profiting from the . family's loss should someone offer more. 'My family wants to buy our family farm of many years - but because we are in foreclosure, JP Morgan Chase (the servicer) and US Bank (the trustee), two of the largest banks in the US, are refusing to even hear an offer until we have been evicted,' Mrs Gearing wrote in a Change.org petition. Losing their home: The Gearing family of Georgia, whose seven children are pictured, are in a battle with the banks after offering to buy back their foreclosed home from the bank but refused until other offers are received . Mrs Gearing added that her seven children, ages seven to 17, and their aunt, who suffers from Alzheimer's disease, all live in the her five-bedroom, custom-built home. 'My husband did very well,' Mrs Gearing, 42, told ABC of their 5,500-square-foot home they took a $1.4 million mortgage out on in 2006. 'We worked very hard, obviously. We're just victims of the economy just like everyone else. It affected everybody on all levels,' she said. With the recession cutting her husband's earnings to a quarter of what he previously made, and finding themselves unable to make their near $7,000 monthly mortgage payments - despite the mother now working as a house keeper as well as a substitute teacher - the couple filed Chapter 7 bankruptcy in February of 2011. Five months later in July, their house was foreclosed. 'My husband started packing when we were notified of the foreclosure,' she said. 'I didn't give up.' Make an offer: A family friend has since offered to buy their house for them for $300,000 after comparing the retail price of surrounding homes, but their bank says they'd rather wait on another offer (file photo) A family friend came to their rescue earlier this year, offering to purchase the home at its current market value so they'd be able to remain living in it. Over time, they promised to pay this friend back. Mrs Gearing said the gesture was an overwhelmingly hopeful one with the family unable to imagine finding another home or apartment large enough to house them all. The family friend, who wished not to be named, made a cash offer to U.S. Bank for the house for $300,000 - a figure which was found by comparing the surrounding homes' current selling price. Yet U.S. Bank, despite being listed on their foreclosure, said they didn't own the property and were just one of several financial firms that possessed it. It prompted what the family has now called a 'run-around,' connecting JPMorgan Chase to the foreclosure as well. 'We have tried tirelessly to work with the bank to keep our home, but have been given the run-around by the bank each time - often calling and being forwarded to scores of representatives, none of which say they can do anything to negotiate!' Mrs Gearing writes with her petition that has received nearly 200,000 signatures of support. 'Now, we have managed to find outside financing and are trying to submit an offer to JPMorgan Chase to buy back our home (in cash) ... But JPMorgan Chase, claiming bureaucratic process, is refusing to even hear or consider offers on the property until we have been evicted.' 'In servicing a property, we follow the investors' guidelines to avoid foreclosure when possible and to minimize the loss in the case of foreclosure,' Chase said in a statement to ABC. 'After foreclosure, we seek to sell the home for fair market value.' While possibly unable to offer much more for the home if asked by the bank, the family say there has been some good news as Chase sent a real estate agent to assess the home's value on Thursday. On Tuesday of next week, an appraiser is set to visit as well. The news couldn't home faster for the family as the November 5 eviction date looms. If it does go through, the family said they will still try and buy the home back but do not want to have to move out and then move back in again. 'Just to do that and move back in? For what reason? Red tape?' she said. Mrs Gearing says she has since started looking at apartments in the area so her children can continue to attend their schools. Asked if the family's friend would be willing to pay more for the property, Mrs Gearing said they'd pay only what she called a 'fair' price.","Jeanette and Bill Gearing 'tried offering their bank cash for their five-bedroom home but it has been refused'

After an argument, Michael Parr, 46, warned the self-employed plumber: 'You don’t know what I’m capable of', before he returned, produced an axe from his jacket and swung it at the victim’s head.

Joseph Resetarits, 18, and Anthony Resetarits, 20, were arrested separately last Thursday in Homer and Anchorage, Alaska. The brothers face charges of felony sexual assault for sexual penetration of an incapacitated person. The younger brother attends Homer High School and was a member of the Mariners football team until his dismissal on Thursday. Charged: Joseph Resetarits, 18, (pictured) and his 20-year-old brother Anthony have been charged with the sexual assault of a boy who was passed out drunk at a party in Homer, Alaska . Anthony Resetarits lists his profession as a commercial fisherman. Police were alerted to the assault by a . nurse at a Homer hospital on September 10, according to a complaint filed in Homer Superior . Court. The party started late on Saturday, September 8 and continued into the next morning. The boy arrived at the party about 10 . pm, and witnesses said he was drinking heavily. He passed out on a couch about an hour later. The party quickly grew from a few invited guests to as many as 80 people, including many members of the Homer Mariners football team. Some of the people at the party began . taking turns writing on the boy's body with markers before Anthony .

'Conspiracy' victim: Teacher Patricia Isabella Davies has fought to clear her name since she was sacked for allegedly miming a lewd act . A science teacher who was sacked for allegedly miming a lewd act with a broomstick during class may have been set up by pupils in a conspiracy which turned into schoolyard ‘folk history’, a judge has said. Patricia Isabella Davies was dismissed in 2006 after several pupils claimed that she simulated male masturbation, using a broom as a prop, while teaching them about the production of static electricity by friction at Willingsworth High School in Tipton, West Midlands in 2004. The former assistant head of science at the school has battled to clear her name ever since and yesterday, Appeal Court Judge Lord Justice Elias ruled that there was ‘a considerable amount of evidence’ that she had been an innocent victim of a ‘conspiracy’ among her pupils. He granted her permission to argue her case at the Court of Appeal. Outside court after the hearing Miss Davies said: ‘I know what's gone on. ‘I'm fed up with what's happened to me.’ The teacher from Wolverhampton, in her 50s, was given a final warning over the incident in 2005 after ‘a number of statements either in double figures or approaching double figures’ were received by the school from pupils who said they had witnessed her demonstration. She was dismissed by local education authority, Sandwell Metropolitan Borough Council, in 2006 for alleged misconduct with the broomstick allegation counting crucially against her. Although Miss Davies' unfair dismissal claim was rejected last year by an Employment Tribunal, which said the warning had been issued in good faith, her representative, Ivan Yates, told the judge there is powerful material contradicting the children's story. That included records showing that she had in fact been teaching Hooke's Law of Elasticity on the critical day and attendance registers indicated that two of the pupils who made statements condemning her were actually absent from school at the time. Mr Yates said: ‘On that date, she provides something appropriate - which was a broom - to demonstrate Hooke's Law. ‘She had taught the class static electricity on another day and the two lessons have been conflated together to make something salacious.’ The school had viewed the children's evidence as overwhelming but attacking that conclusion was ‘obviously wrong’. He said: ‘You have got statements from children not in the lesson and you've got the lesson on the wrong day.’ Justice Elias said that there was ‘some possibility that there may have been some sort of conspiracy by the pupils to fabricate the incident’. Permission to plead: Judge Lord Justice Elias said there was considerable evidence that pupils had conspired against her and he gave her ermission to argue her case at the Court of Appeal (pictured) He said: ‘The school proceeded on the basis that the evidence from the children was so overwhelming that the new evidence could not be considered relevant. ‘The tribunal was satisfied that the final warning was given in good faith and had not been unfairly or improperly issued. It may well be that is a wholly sustainable conclusion. ‘However, I see some force in the submission that, where an employer has deliberately chosen to ignore evidence that, if it had been accepted, would wholly undermine what, on the face of it, would be powerful evidence of misconduct, in those circumstances perhaps the final warning ought to be construed as a nullity. ‘I am granting permission in this case.’ Her case will now go ahead to a full Appeal Court hearing.","Patricia Isabella Davies was dismissed in 2006 after pupils claimed she simulated male masturbation in class in 2004 .

Opportunity had spent 19 weeks stuck in one place to 'weather out' the dark months of the Martian winter on an outcrop called Greeley Haven. This week, the solar power rose enough for it to drive again. A view captured by Opportunity before starting its first drive of 2012. The Rover has been 'stuck' in the same place for 19 weeks, waiting for the sun to provide enough power. This week, it drove 12 feet . Forward view from Opportunity this week: Opportunity has worked through four Martian southern hemisphere winters since it landed in in January 2004 about 14 miles northwest of its current location . Opportunity has worked through four Martian southern hemisphere winters since it landed in in January 2004 about 14 miles northwest of its current location.Closer to the equator than its twin rover, Spirit, Opportunity has not needed to stay on a sun-facing slope during the previous winters.Now, however, Opportunity's solar panels carry a thicker coating of dust, and the team is using a strategy employed for three winters with Spirit: staying on a sun-facing slope. Since landing in the Meridiani region of Mars on Jan. 25, 2004,  Opportunity has driven 21.4 miles.Opportunity and its rover twin, Spirit, completed their three-month prime missions on Mars in April 2004. Both rovers continued for years of bonus, extended missions. Both have made important discoveries about wet environments on ancient Mars that may have been favorable for supporting microbial life. Spirit stopped communicating in 2010. Opportunity knocks: The rover has been on Mars for nearly eight years . Water discovery: Opportunity helped confirm that Mars used to be much warmer and wetter . On average it lies 141.6 million miles from the Sun. With a diameter of 4,222 miles, it’s around half the size of the Earth. It’s absolutely freezing there, with an average temperature of -85F (-65C). Gravity is much less powerful - slightly less than 40 per cent of ours. The . atmosphere is desperately thin – one per cent of Earth’s pressure – and . not very nice for us humans because 95 per cent of it is carbon . dioxide. It boasts the solar . system’s biggest mountain – Olympus Mons, a dead volcano with . staggering proportions. It measures 335 miles across and rises to a . height of 88,000ft, which is almost three times higher than Everest. Mars has two cosmic sidekicks – the moons Deimos and Phobos. Mars’s red colouring comes from the iron oxide that coats its surface. Mars . has huge amounts of ice at its polar caps. If they melted, it would . cover the whole planet in water 11-metres deep, according to Nasa. Among its chores is studying bedrock . and soil at its chosen winter site. While Opportunity can drive short . distances from one outcrop to another, it cannot venture far in the . cold. It is a . bittersweet juncture for Opportunity, which along with its twin, . Spirit, landed on opposite sides of the red planet in January 2004. Spirit . suddenly stopped communicating with Earth last year, shortly after it . became stuck in fluffy sand. Nasa diligently listened for any sign from . Spirit and finally gave up this past spring. Despite . Spirit's demise, Opportunity continued to trek across the Martian . plains and arrived at the western rim of Endeavour Crater in August. The . rover has wowed scientists with discoveries at the site, which includes . rocks and soil unlike any it has encountered during its years roaming . the planet. Opportunity recently uncovered a mineral deposit that formed from water flowing out of volcanic rocks. Chief . scientist Steve Squyres of Cornell University called it the ‘single . most powerful piece of evidence’ that Opportunity has found so far of . liquid water existing on Mars long ago. The finding was presented at a meeting of the American Geophysical Union in San Francisco. With . a little over 21 miles on the clock, Opportunity is showing some wear, . including an arthritic shoulder, but is otherwise in good health. ‘It's . going on eight years, but we're not done yet,’ said Ray Arvidson, the . mission deputy scientist from Washington University in St Louis.

'During his time in hospital he had countless blood tests, MRI scans and X-rays. His paediatrician luckily had seen Angelman Syndrome once before and had his blood tested for it. 'It was only when we were told that he needed to have these genetic tests that I became wary. 'It was a total shock when the tests came back positive and we were told that he had Angelman - I’d never heard of it before. Elliot's condition means he will never talk, and may struggle to walk . Medics encouraged Gale and Craig to research the condition online. Mrs Eland said: 'We were driving home in the car and my husband was looking up Angelman syndrome on his phone. 'He started reading all these things off the computer and in the end I was sobbing so much I had to pull over the car. 'It was so hard to begin with because we knew so little about it. It was only thanks to charities and support groups that we were able to cope.' Elliot's parents say they see him smiling as a happy side effect of an otherwise difficult condition. Mrs Eland said: 'We always just thought he was a really happy baby, we never even considered it would be a symptom of something more serious. 'I don’t understand why Elliot always laughs and smiles, but he always has a lovely big smile on his face. 'Sometimes I don’t even think it’s a result of the Angelman syndrome - he doesn’t have a care in the world, so why wouldn’t he be happy?' The toddler also seems to only need a few hours of sleep a night . Elliot’s Angelman Syndrome - a condition he also shares with actor Colin Farrell’s son - also affects his development. Gale said: 'Elliot will never be able to . speak, but we’ve done a signing course in the hope that we’ll still be . able to communicate with him. 'It must be frustrating for him because he can understand what we say, but he can’t respond. 'A lot of children with Angelman syndrome communicate using iPads so we’re saving up for one. 'He may never be able to walk either - if he does, he’ll probably be quite unbalanced.' A further symptom of the condition is that two-year-old Elliot appears to need only a few hours of sleep a night. His mother added: 'He goes to sleep very easily but he wakes up in the night and just lies there.'We would guess at the moment he has about four hours sleep a night. 'He’s perfectly happy in bed at the moment because he doesn’t need much to keep him entertained, but as he gets older he’ll need some more stimulation. 'We’ll also need to make sure that his bedroom is safe when he’s unsupervised, so a soft floor and a low bed will be really important.' Elliot’s family have found comfort in the charity ASSERT, a support group to help families of those with the condition. They also have a fundraising society for Elliot called One Big Tickle: www.onebigtickle.co.uk . Angelman Syndrome is a rare genetic condition first identified in 1965 by a British doctor, Harry Angelman. Dr Angelman had noticed similarities between a small number of previously undiagnosed children that seemed to indicate they had a common problem. After seeing a painting in the Castelvecchio museum in Verona, Italy entitled A Boy with a Puppet he was inspired to write a medical paper titled Puppet Children. The syndrome - originally called 'Happy Puppet Syndrome' because of the characteristic happy demeanour and stiff jerky movements of the children - was renamed Angelman Syndrome in 1982. Although at first little was known and indeed few other cases identified, in recent years much more has been learned. During the 1980's advances in genetic medicine made it possible to diagnose increasing numbers of cases and also to start identifying the cause. In simple terms, it is a chromosome disorder that causes severe learning difficulties. Angelman Syndrome is not a disease, it is a neurological disorder that causes severe learning difficulties, and although those affected have a normal life expectancy, they will require looking after throughout their lives. Most AS children are diagnosed between the ages of three and seven when the characteristic physical and behavioural features become evident.For more information visit: www.angelmanuk.org/angelman_syndrome.html .","Two-year-old Elliot Eland has Angelman syndrome - a rare chromosome disorder that causes a permanent smile on his face .

Scientists performing CT scans on the head of an Egyptian mummy say they have found one of the worst cases of dental problems ever seen - an a unique treatment to try and treat it. Researchers CT scanning a 2,100 year old mummy were stunned to find evidence of a sinus infection caused by a mouthful of cavities and other tooth problems. The also came across a unique find - a cavity filled with linen. Researchers used a CT scanner to see inside the man's mouth, and created a 3D reconstruction showing the worn incisors . Using a piece of linen, which may have . first been dipped in a medicine such as fig juice or cedar oil, a form . of 'packing' in the biggest and most painful cavity, located on the left . side of his jaw between the first and second molars, was inserted. This acted as a barrier to prevent food particles from getting . into the cavity, with any medicine on the linen helping to ease the . pain, the study researchers said. The man, whose name is unknown, was in . his 20s or early 30s, and lived at a time when Egypt was ruled by a . dynasty of Greek kings. Andrew Wade, at the University of . Western Ontario, used new high-resolution CT scans of his teeth and . body, according to the . International Journal of Paleopathology. Researchers said this is the first . known case of such packing treatment done on an ancient Egyptian. 'The . dental treatment, filling a large inter-proximal cavity [a cavity . between two teeth] with a protective, likely medicine-laden, barrier is a . unique example of dental intervention in ancient Egypt,' the team . writes in their journal article. 'The dental packing described here is unique among ancient Egyptian . mummies studied to date, and represents one of only a few recorded . dental interventions in ancient Egypt. CT scans of the entire mouth were carried out to allow the researchers to recreate a 3D version. The linen filling can be be seen on the right of the mouth . Dentistry was relatively commonplace in Egypt, . and records indicate that it was being practiced at least as far . back as when the Great Pyramids were built. However, this finding has led researchers to believe experts may have practiced advanced techniques. Dental problems were not unusual, as the coarsely ground grain ancient Egyptians consumed was not good for the teeth. The team say the find add weight to the theory that dentists were commonplace in Egypt. 'Such a finding lends further support for the existence of a group of . dental specialists practicing interventional medicine in ancient Egypt. 'While the physical evidence, to date for other interventions, may be . scarce, the findings presented here should underline the need to . continue to look for evidence of dental packing as well as other . therapeutic dental interventions in the ancient world.' The . small linen mass was initially found during a scan in the mid-1990s, . but the scanning resolution of the time was too low to allow a full . analysis. The high-resolution scanner his team used for their latest study was six times as powerful. The young wealthy man from Thebes was nearing the end of his life when his dental problem hit, researchers believe. The man, whose name is unknown, was in his 20s or early 30s, and had 'numerous' abscesses and cavities, conditions that appear to have resulted, at some point, in a sinus infection, something potentially deadly, the study researchers said, although they could not pinpoint his cause of death. The 3D reconstruction was made from data collected during high resolution CT scans of the mummy. When he died he was mummified, his brain and many of his organs taken out, resin put in and his body wrapped. Embalmers left his heart inside the body, a sign perhaps of his elite status, researchers say. After being mummified he was likely put in a coffin and given funerary rites befitting someone of his wealth and stature. Where he was laid to rest in Thebes . isn't known, as his body was not seen again until 1859 when James . Ferrier, a businessman and politician, brought the mummified body (the . whereabouts of the coffin is unknown) to Montreal, where today it lies . in the Redpath Museum at McGill University. Experts say the pain the young man . suffered would have been excruciating, and say his problems would have . been a 'serious health risk' for modern dentists. Despite the help, he succumbed shortly after, perhaps in just a matter of weeks. Dentistry was nothing new in Egypt, . ancient records indicate that it was being practiced at least as far . back as when the Great Pyramids were built. Dental problems were also not unusual, the coarsely ground grain ancient Egyptians consumed was not good for the teeth.

Curvy Pamela Nascimento, 27, appeared as the glamorous assistant host on several prime-time game shows. She is believed to have died on the operating table after suffering a perforated kidney during the cosmetic surgery at the private clinic in Sao Paulo, where she lived. The cause of her death was registered as hypovolemic shock, where severe blood loss makes the heart unable to pump enough blood to the body. It was reportedly the third time the model had undergone the stomach-flattening procedure. Ms Nascimento's death on October 19 was only made public this week. The body was taken to Sao Francisco do Sul, Santa Catarina, where she was buried. Only after the burial were police was informed about the case by the victim's aunt, Enedida Nascimento, 61. Police today said they will be exhuming her body and could charge the surgeon who performed the operation, Dr Julio Yoshimura, with manslaughter. The doctor could also be charged with procedural fraud as the police were not notified about the death, and her death certificate written by the same doctor who had performed the operation, a spokesman added. Ms Nascimento was originally from the southern state of Santa Catarina, where she was brought up by her aunt after her mother died when she was six.

A spokesman for Green Hill Hospital, one of Sao Paulo's most exclusive plastic surgery clinics, said they had opened an investigation into the tragedy. He said: 'All the information will be documented and submitted to the relevant authorities.

Ailing holiday giant Thomas Cook has reassured its customers that their holidays are ‘in safe hands’ after it received an extra £100 million lifeline from its banks last week. But the firm may still have to close 200 of its 1,100 UK travel shops and axe 1,000 jobs in a bid to reduce its huge debt mountain. Facing the axe: Thomas Cook may have to close up to 200 of its UK travel agencies in a bid to slash costs . The group launched a publicity drive this week amid fears that negative headlines may have deterred holidaymakers from booking with the company.The debt-laden firm saw UK bookings plunge by 30 per cent last week amid uncertainty over the group’s future.Thomas Cook’s interim chief executive Sam Weihagen will publish a letter in national newspapers from tomorrow saying it is safe to book breaks with the group. Mr Weihagen's letter will begin: ‘What a week it has been for Thomas Cook,’ adding that it is now ‘an even stronger and more confident company’ and members of the public 'can be sure that your holiday really is in safe hands’.His words will play on the 170-year-old company's history and will claim it is the ‘most recognised and established name in the industry’.The letter will add: ‘I have no doubt that we will still be in another 170 years and beyond.’ Dip in profits: The debt-laden firm saw UK bookings plunge by 30% last week . The company’s share price slumped by a massive 75 per cent in one day last week amid fears of an imminent collapse.But the shares rose 30 per cent today after the company announced an extra £100 million lifeline from its banks on Friday night.The £200 million funding headroom was approved by the company's syndicate of banks, which include Barclays, HSBC, RBS and UniCredit, and will last until April 30 2013.It will replace the £100 million short-term facility announced on October 21 2011. James Hollins, an analyst at Evolution Securities, said the new lending facility had secured the company's short-term survival.He added: ‘The increased facility pushes current gross debt to £1.5 billion but fortunately all the bad press has come at a low point in the booking cycle and the group has the funds and time to restore partner and consumer confidence in its brand and survival.’Mr Weihagen suggested that the multi-million pound loan might have been repaid in full by this time next year.He admitted, however, that it ‘may take two to three years to come to an acceptable profitability’.However, he refused to be drawn on possible shop closures and speculation about thousands of job losses within the UK.He said only that the firm was evaluating its shop estate and making sure ‘the shops we do have operating are profitable’. Sign of the times: Thomas Cook, which sells more than 22 million holidays a year in the UK, has suffered from the impact of the Arab spring . In the meantime, he added, new management had been put in place in the UK, where trade has been suffering.‘The UK business this year has not really performed as good as we had hoped and not as good as competitors have performed and that was a management issue so we have replaced the management in the UK and started a turnaround plan,' he said.‘I'm very confident that plan will make sure our UK business will return to a much better profitability over time.’The travel agency, which was founded in 1841 and sells more than 22 million holidays a year in the UK, was hit by a slowdown in trade due to weak consumer confidence and unrest in North Africa.The group has suffered from the impact of the Arab spring, which has hit bookings to Tunisia and Egypt, destinations popular with France and Russia respectively, as well as UK holidaymakers.","200 UK travel shops and 1,000 jobs could be axed .

The price is the same as the cheapest third generation iPad, and will put the two firms into a head to head battle. The Surface will go on sale the same day Microsoft releases Windows 8, the new version of its desktop computer software - and three days after Apple is expected to introduce a cheaper, mini version of its iPad. Scroll down for video . Microsoft's Surface will cost between £399 and £559 when it goes on sale in the UK later this month . The Surface is Microsoft's first foray into computer hardware. Based on a Nvidia Corp chip designed by ARM . Holdings, the Surface will run a simplified version of Windows 8 that is . not compatible with old Microsoft applications. However, . the tablet will feature new app-style versions of Office mainstays such . as Word, PowerPoint and Excel, and will include Xbox games, video and . music apps. The Surface, with two cameras and a USB port, will be Wi-Fi only. Microsoft has made no mention of a wireless-enabled version. It will also launch just a day after Amazon launches it popular range of Fire tablets in the UK for the first time. Experts say the price could lead to major problems for Microsoft. The firm waited until today to reveal it, despite having unveiled the tablet last month. 'It is priced the same as the iPad 3, even though the Surface has a higher spec with 32gb rather than the iPad's 16gb,' said Stuart Miles of gadget website Pocket Lint. 'However, the consumer is unlikely to understand that - they will simple see that it's a straight choice between an iPad and Surface, and I think the majority of people will choose an iPad - they just won't be aware of a spec fight.' 'If you've used Windows Phone the Surface is easier to use, but not many people have - and people love or hate it.' The software giant also showed the first TV ad for its tablet, heralding the start of what some believe could be a $400m ad push for Surface and Windows 8. The dancing based ad was shown in a prime TV slot during the US version of Dancing With The Stars. The advert begins with a single user snapping on the keyboard to a Surface tablet. It . then sees dozens of dancers creating a complex dance routine using the . gadgets, with everyone from families to dancing schoolgirls using them. The adverts show choreographed dance routines using the tablet and its snap on keyboard cover . The first advert focuses on the surface tablet's keyboard, which Microsoft believes will give it an advantage over the iPad . The latest adverts are expected to be the first of many as the firm makes final preparations for the launches of Windows 8 and the Surface tablet. Some US experts believe the firm could have an advertising budget of up to $400m for the launch. Yesterday the firm announced details of the music service the tablet will have, Xbox Music. Although access to Microsoft's Surface tablet has been tightly controlled, we were able to try the software it will run on a Samsung tablet. The biggest problem Microsoft faces is, without doubt, first impressions. While everyone from toddlers to grannies can instantly use an iPad without being taught, the Windows software we used was a different story. It was confusing and unintuitive at first - with even the simplest task not easy to do without being shown how. It is, like Microsoft's mobile phone software, extremely slick and well though out once you get used to it - but the problem Microsoft faces is how to get consumers to give it a go, when the alternative is an iPad the entire family can instantly pick up and use. It boasts 30 million songs, with a free ad version and a paid £8.99 ($9.99) version being available when Windows 8 launches. The paid subscription is also . required if you want to use Xbox Music on the Xbox 360 game console or . on smartphones that use Windows Phone. On the game console, an Xbox Live Gold membership is also required.

A Missouri couple has filed for bankruptcy just eight years after winning a $20 million lawsuit against the makers of a butter popcorn flavoring that gave one of them lung disease. Eric Peoples of Carthage and his wife, Cassandra, sued International Flavors and Fragrances Inc. and Bush Boake Allen Inc. in 2004 after Mr Peoples developed bronchiolitis obliterans while working at a popcorn plant in Jasper. But just eight years later, the two are being forced to sell the home they built for $3.9 million to pay off creditors, after their financial situation went spectacularly downhill. Popcorn couple: Eric Peoples, pictured right with wife Cassandra, have filed for bankruptcy after winning a $20 million verdict against the makers of a butter popcorn flavouring in 2004 . According to the Joplin Globe, the Peoples listed the current value of their residence and 10.5 acres of land at just $700,000 and personal property assets of nearly $33,000. But their liabilities are listed at more than $611,000, including a $482,876 mortgage with U.S. Bank. The couple's case against the butter flavouring companies was the first of several brought by workers and their spouses. The suit claimed Mr Peoples, who has two children with his wife, developed . the lung disease after being exposed to diacetyl, a . chemical present in the flavouring to give a buttery taste and aroma. Researchers . have found that, when heated, the chemical produces a toxic, . potentially lethal gas, and can leave those exposed with a shortness of . breath, a dry cough and wheezing. At the trial, doctors testified that Eric Peoples would eventually need a double-lung transplant. Losing their home: The couple are being forced to sell the Carthage home, pictured, they spent $3.9 million on . Drop: The Peoples listed the current value of their residence, pictured, and 10.5 acres of land at just $700,000 . Opulent: Pictures show the grand entryway to the home, which took five years to build . A Jasper County jury awarded Eric Peoples $18 million and his wife $2 million. It has never been revealed exactly how much of that verdict money the couple received. Mr Peoples said at the time that his . attorney's firm would take 35 per cent of the pay out, and their . attorney, Ken McClain, suggested a portion would be spread among other . workers involved in the lawsuits. Though it is not clear how they spent . the remaining millions, purchases include two Honda automobiles, a . Chrysler PT Cruiser and a Kawasaki Mule. Other personal property listed in . court documents include a bedroom set, dryer, end tables, china, lamps, a . VCR, a microwave oven and $50 worth of camera equipment, ABC reported. Since winning the lawsuit, Cassandra . Peoples has also been employed by Smith Midwest . Realty as a realtor. Social networking sites also indicate she helps run PJ's Country Bakery in Joplin, Missouri. Struggle: Eric Peoples, pictured left in 2007 in front of the Jasper popcorn plant and right with his wife at the wedding of their daughter, has suffered ill health since working for the company . But among the unsecured claims the couple list in their bankruptcy petition is a November 1, 2011, judgment in Jasper County Circuit Court to Jeff Neely, the contractor who built their home over a five-year period. He sued them in August 2011, claiming they still owed him $107,147. The couple failed to respond to the lawsuit in a timely manner, and a judge granted Mr Neely a default judgment at an annual interest rate of 9 per cent. The couple filed a motion last December asking the judge to set aside the default judgment because of difficulties, including a downturn in Mr Peoples' health. Their motion also asserted a basis for a counterclaim against Mr Neely because they said the house initially was estimated to cost $400,000, but skyrocketed to more than $3.9 million. Neither the Peoples' motion nor the bankruptcy petition explains the $3.2 million difference between what they claimed to have paid to build the home and what they say the property is worth now. Popcorn lung, also known as bronchiolitis obliterans, may be caused by inhalation of airborne diacetyl, a chemical used to produce the butter-like flavoring in microwaveable popcorn. When the chemical is heated, it produces a toxic, potentially fatal gas, researchers believe. The non-reversible disease affects the bronchioles - small airway branches in the lungs - which become narrowed by scar tissue and inflammation. It causes dry cough, shortness of breath and wheezing, and can lead to the need for lung transplants. It first came to public attention when eight former employees of the Gilster-Mary Lee popcorn plant in Jasper, Missouri, developed bronchiolitis obliterans in the late 1990s. In 2000, the Missouri Department of Health called in The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) to make a determination of the cause, and to recommend safety measures. After surveying the plant and each patient's medical history, NIOSH recommended respiratory protection for all workers in microwave popcorn production .

"By . Chris Brooke . UPDATED: . 06:17 EST, 7 March 2012 . Living on one of England’s finest aristocratic estates, the  villagers of Beeley have for generations been subservient to their wealthy landowner. But rebellion is stirring among residents on the historic acres of Chatsworth. A dispute over three cottages has triggered a feudal-style row between the Duke of Devonshire and residents of the ‘tied’ village. Opponent: Siobhan Spencer outside 1, 2 and 3 Dove Cottages in Beeley, which are at the centre of a row over plans by the Chatsworth Estate to turn the Grade II-listed homes into holiday rentals . 'All consuming': The conversions would bring the total proportion of holiday rentals in the hamlet (above) to 25 per cent in move critics say places too much emphasis on tourism . History: The Grade II-listed Dove Cottages are at the centre of the dispute . They fear the scale of tourism connected to Chatsworth House stately home is damaging the community, and the plan to turn the old stone buildings into more hotel rooms is a step too far. Beeley’s residents have formed a heritage group to protect the character of their village and a petition with 61 signatures has been presented to national park planners, who are due to decide on the application in two days’ time. Objectors are worried about the dwindling number of affordable starter homes for people in the Peak District National Park community. If the hotel extension is granted, one in four homes would be ‘holiday lets’ and have a ‘detrimental impact on village life’, they say. Although planning consent is recommended by officers, the decision is said to be in the balance due to the strength of local feeling. Feudal row: The Duke of Devonshire (above) owns the vast Chatsworth Estate, which includes the hamlet of Beeley . Until they became vacant, the Grade II listed Dove Cottages – situated opposite the Devonshire Arms Hotel in the heart of Beeley – had been homes to generations of estate workers since the mid-1800s. The hotel is one of a chain of upmarket ‘Devonshire’ hotels belonging to the Duke and Duchess and the change of use consent would give it six extra valuable en suite bedrooms. Beeley nestles on the banks of the River Derwent in Derbyshire, one-and-a-half miles from the aristocratic home. It has 86 homes and a population of 200. Siobhan Spencer has lived there for 30 years and her husband has worked for the Duke for decades. They have a ‘tied house for life’, but she is concerned that this is an unlikely prospect for people brought up there now. It is ‘virtually impossible for many young people to get on the property ladder’ as they compete with outsiders and tourism, she said. Many families are forced to move away. She added: ‘These cottages are right in the heart of the community and allowing them to be turned into hotel rooms threatens to kill that. ‘Beeley is not a very big place and it feels like the tourism aspect of Chatsworth is going to become all-consuming.’ Not so tranquil: The Chatsworth Estate, upon which Chatsworth House (above) lies, has defended itself by saying it also owns 15 other houses in the village which are occupied by estate staff and pensioners . In papers presented to the planning committee, Chatsworth stated it owns none of the 11 other holiday cottages. Of 31 houses owned by the estate, 15 are occupied by staff and pensioners and 12 let on residential tenancies. It argues this demonstrates commitment to affordable housing. Yesterday, Nick Wood, land agent for Chatsworth, said: ‘The village has more affordable housing than many ... and we do provide other affordable housing in other villages. ‘But we can’t do that without running a business. It is a balance and we don’t think we have stepped over the line.’ Beeley was bought in 1747 by the third Duke of Devonshire.","Residents fighting application to convert cottages into hotel rooms .

Alagoa Morris, coordinator at advocacy group Oil Watch Nigeria, said: 'What did these small ones know about coming to scoop fuel?' He said some women wailed at the scene of the explosion, desperately looking for their relatives. The location of some of the bodies suggested that the victims were trying to run away when fire consumed them.

It was not immediately clear what had caused the fire that left the truck burned to ashes. Tragedy: The victims had been scooping up spilled petrol after the tanker crashed when it caught on fire . Scene of destruction: Crowds of onlookers stare in disbelief at the carnage in front of them . People stand near burnt roofing sheets after the tanker overturned and exploded. At least 50 others were injured in the incident .

President Goodluck Jonathan said in a statement he is 'deeply saddened by the loss of many lives' caused by the explosion and 'particularly distraught by the fact that once again, so many Nigerian lives have been lost in an avoidable fuel fire disaster'. A photographer who was at the scene said that the accident occurred on a major East-West highway that was being expanded. Construction workers, however, hadn't yet reached the level where the accident occurred which remained a single lane, often forcing vehicles racing head-on to seek avoiding each other. Mr Alagoa said the accident 'would not have happened' if the road had two lanes there. At least two contracts have been signed over the last six years to expand the highway that runs through Niger Delta states, according to a government website. However, corruption often hinders or slows down road construction and maintenance projects. Accidents are also common on Nigeria's poorly maintained roads. Drivers often travel at high speed and overtake slower vehicles, leading to head-on collisions with high death rates. 'This tells a tragic story about the state of national infrastructure and the poverty of the people,' said Nnimmo Bassey, executive director of Environmental Rights Action.

Italian campaigners have collected over 150,000 signatures calling on the Louvre museum in Paris to hand over Leonardo Da Vinci’s Mona Lisa to its 'home city' of Florence. The world’s most famous painting should be returned to the Uffizi museum where was displayed early in the 20th Century, according to the National Committee for Historical, Cultural and Environmental Heritage, which organised the petition. Committee President Silvano Vincenti said he has made a formal request to the French minister of culture, Aurelie Filippetti, for the painting to be given back. Classic: The Mona Lisa is widely considered to be the most famous work of art in the world . He said the return of the painting would be of 'high historical value, both symbolic and moral'. But the Louvre museum itself has already snubbed the committee. And Florence’s claims on the Renaissance masterpiece, known by Italians as La Gioconda, might not be that straightforward. Leonardo is thought to have begun work on the enigmatic portrait of Lisa del Giocondo, the wife of a wealthy Tuscan silk merchant, in Florence in 1503. But art historians think he took it with him when he moved to France in 1516. The French Royal family then acquired it and following a spell at Versailles it ended up at the Louvre museum after the French Revolution. Current home: The Louvre museum, in Paris, where the Mona Lisa is hung . Rightful owners? Italian campaigners have called for the painting to be returned to the city of Florence (pictured) It was stolen from the Paris museum in 1911and was discovered two years later at the Florence home of the Italian patriot and former Louvre employee Vincenzo Peruggia.

When teenage tearaway Mark Hook was treated to a three-month ‘character building’ trip to Africa it was supposed to deter him from a life of crime. But just weeks after his £7,000 tour of Egypt, Kenya, Tanzania, Malawi, Zimbabwe, and Zambia ‘Safari Boy’ Hook was arrested for drink driving and carrying a knife. Now, almost 20 years and 113 offences later, Hook has been branded a ‘perpetual villain’ by a judge tired of constantly seeing him in the dock. Laughing: Hook in 1993, left, after going on the African safari and right, now aged 35 in his latest police mugshot. He may look back on his life and wish he had taken the opportunity to change his ways . Hook, 35, was in jail last night . after being sentenced at Gloucester Crown Court for his latest crimes – . mugging an elderly shopper and handling credit cards stolen from another . woman. He was sentenced to . 18 months in prison by Judge Jamie Tabor QC but because he has been in . custody on remand for nine months he will be free again within days. In . his 32nd court appearance, Judge Tabor told career criminal Hook: ‘We . have been looking at each other across this court for many years. ‘There . have been many protestations from you that you are going to become an . honest citizen and behave yourself. So far you haven’t.’ He added: ‘You have an appalling record.’ Hook’s . 88-day junket to Africa caused nationwide condemnation in 1993 and was . even criticised by the then prime minister John Major. Junket: Hook, back row second from left, poses with a group in Egypt at the Temple of Karnak while enjoying the £7,000 safari to try and stop his offending in 1993 . Expelled from school at 14, Hook had been sent to Bryn Melyn in North Wales, a therapy centre for unruly teenagers. The . trip was supposed to take him out of the environment where he had been a . young offender and show him places where people were worse off than . him. Hook claims he is a . direct ancestor of soldier Henry Hook who won the Victoria Cross . fighting Zulus at Rorke’s Drift in Natal, South Africa in 1879. But the only thing the teenager brought back from his tour of Africa was a determination to continue his life of crime. In . January 1994, just months after the trip, Hook appeared at Gloucester . Crown Court for 34 offences including burglary and taking a car without . consent and he was given a year’s supervision order. That year he was back in court twice for burglary offences, handling stolen goods and driving while disqualified. By the time he was an adult, Hook had blossomed into a lifelong criminal with a heroin and crack cocaine habit to feed. Over the last 18 years he has served prison sentences for aggravated burglary, theft and wounding.In . his most recent court appearance, Judge Tabor said Hook’s crimes were . exactly the same as when he was last jailed – for two years – in 2009 . for mugging a frail 80-year-old man in the street. He said: ‘Your latest offences were planned and you acted in concert with another person. You are a perpetual villain.’ Hook's innocent smile as a child, left, gave little indication of the terror he would inflict on his victims over the years. Right, he laughs in in 1994 having been to court for dozens more offences after the taxpayer-funded trip . Hook . pleaded guilty to stealing a bag from an elderly shopper in an alleyway . near an Asda store in Gloucester in September last year. He also . admitted handling credit cards stolen on the same afternoon from another . elderly woman. A second man, Jason Marshall, 23, was involved in the offences and has already been jailed for 18 months. Marshall . had been arrested soon after the offence and the court heard how Hook . had called Crimestoppers claiming he had witnessed the robbery and tried . to stop the assailant. Prosecutor . Andrew Wilkins said: ‘He was aware the robber had been arrested and he . was worried he might be implicated because his fingerprints might be . found on the stolen property.’ Judge Tabor was unimpressed by Hook’s actions saying: ‘It was a pre-emptive strike by him to try to explain his fingerprints.’ Hook denied any involvement in the offences but was arrested and charged. Safari: Giraffes walk across a plain in the kind of scene that Hook was treated to when he was a teenager. Unfortunately having the kind of holiday that most people dream of did little to temper his offending . Undeterred . by his arrest, Hook went into Debenham’s in Gloucester two weeks later . with credit cards taken from both women and tried to use them. Dermot Clarke, defending, said: ‘He knows you well, your honour, and he doesn’t want to shilly-shally with you. ‘He . is 35 and he has got a four-year-old daughter. He has not seen her . since he was remanded in custody because her mother will not take her to . prison. Illustrious ancestor: Hook claims he is a direct descendant of soldier Henry Hook who won the Victoria Cross fighting Zulus at Rorke¿s Drift in Natal, South Africa in 1879 . ‘You may have heard it before but I have no doubt of his sincerity when he says he never wants to be here again.’ Judge Tabor responded: ‘I don’t want him here again.’ Mr . Clarke said that while on remand Hook had been treated for his drug . addiction and had become the jail’s race relations representative. But the judge said the only factor in Hook’s favour was that he had pleaded guilty. He sentenced him to 18 months for theft and six months for handling stolen goods. The sentences will run concurrently. Hook’s . mother, Rita Dolan, has blamed her son’s continued life of crime on the . fact that social services lavished money on him instead of punishing . him. She has said previously: ‘They spoilt him rotten and did not prepare him for real life.’ But Hook has been adept at manipulating the system. In 2001 he admitted sending a forged doctor’s note to court so he could spend Christmas at home. Then . in 2009 he pledged to work with the Prince’s Trust on a scheme where . experienced burglars helped householders to improve their home security. Mark Hook was one of a host of young offenders pampered by the justice system in the 1990s in a misguided attempt to put them on the straight and narrow. In previous years, the delinquents would have been locked up in borstals or sent to approved schools. Burglar: Clinton Bowen, also known as Canal Boy, grew up to be a drug addict who targeted the elderly . But in the mid-1990s they had become ‘disadvantaged young persons’ who were given all the help the taxpayer could afford. Clinton Bowen was treated to a three-month £12,000 barge holiday in 1997 in an effort to deter him from crime. The 15-year-old became known as ‘Canal Boy’. He grew up to be a drug addict who specialised in raiding the homes of the elderly. In 2001 he was jailed for three years for stealing from a 91-year-old great-grandmother and in 2009 he got five years for carrying out 22 burglaries while on parole. His brother Casey earned the name ‘Pocket Money Boy’ when he was paid £60 a week after 37 arrests between 1992 and 1994. After paying out £1,560, social services stopped the money because his offending increased. Jason Cooper was branded ‘World Tour Boy’ after going on holidays costing the taxpayer £50,000 to ‘instil feelings of self-worth by broadening his horizons’. But Cooper, now 39, progressed to a life in and out of jail for crimes including conspiracy to rob a post office, burglary, fraud and car crime. He even tried to sue social services claiming he had not been taught basic life skills such as how to  claim benefits.","Taxpayer-funded jaunt to Africa in 1993 was supposed to stop offending .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 13:49 EST, 9 September 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 13:49 EST, 9 September 2012 . A retired police chief, shot dead outside his home, was allegedly killed by a former convict 'with an axe to grind', officials say. 82-year-old Herbert Proffitt died in a hail of bullets last month believed to have been fired by Charles Hammer, an 81-year-old ex-con whom he arrested 10 years ago. Known around their small Kentucky town for having a mean streak, Hammer is believed to have sought revenge on Proffitt, gunning him down as he went to fetch the mail. Tragic: Retired police chief Herbert Proffitt was shot to death as he fetched the mail . Their paths first crossed in 2002 when Proffitt arrested Hammer on charges of harassment, disorderly conduct and resisting arrest, triggering a decade-long grudge which police believe led to the killing. 'It appears that there was an axe to grind,' said Trooper Billy Gregory, a spokesman for Kentucky State Police post handling the investigation. 'It appears to me to be revenge.' The slaying has staggered people in Tompkinsville, a tight-knit town in the hills of south-central Kentucky, about 120 miles south of Louisville, where Proffitt's only child, Jeff, is mayor. And adding to the tragedy, Proffitt's wife, Bernice, died five days after the killing. Family friends say she died of a broken heart. Hundreds of grieving well-wishers turned out for the funeral of the man known affectionately as 'Sprocket', a nickname that stuck since his teenage days of fixing bicycles at a service station. 'The town for a week had no direction,' said City Attorney Reed Moore, a family friend. 'Nobody around the (town) square got anything done. They just walked around with a blank look on their face.' During his law enforcement days, . which spanned more than a half-century, Proffitt was known for using his . wits to defuse plenty of dangerous situations in the Appalachian . foothills, his friends said. 'His . best weapon was his knowledge of people and how to handle them,' said . Tompkinsville Police Chief Dale Ford, who worked under Proffitt and . considered him a mentor. But Proffitt never worried that someone he had put away might someday seek revenge, they said. 'He was never the type of person who would look over his shoulder,' said Ricky Richardson, a city commissioner. Revenge shooting? 81-year-old Charles Hammer is accused of killing the former police chief who once arrested him . Monroe County Judge-Executive Tommy Willett said Proffitt was willing to extend a hand to those he once cuffed. 'If he put somebody in jail, he'd be friends with that person -- if they let him -- when they got out,' he said. While town residents mourned Proffitt, they also shared stories about the man accused of killing him and his troubled past. Hammer's initial court appearance is scheduled for Tuesday. Court records turned up no sign that Hammer has lined up an attorney, but a brother came to his defense. 'I don't think he did it,' Jerry Hammer told The Associated Press in a phone interview. 'I think he's covering (up) for somebody.' He declined further comment before hanging up. Bev McClendon, another former local sheriff who said he was friends with Proffitt and Hammer, said Hammer harbored feelings for years of having been wronged. He said Hammer once remarked that McClendon had never barged onto his property, unlike others in law enforcement. 'Sometimes people in these hills and hollows carry a vendetta if they think they've been mistreated,' McClendon said. Ford, the police chief, said Hammer had a history of violence that led to his arrest on several occasions. Arrest records show Hammer had several times been picked up for alcohol intoxication, disorderly conduct and harassment, among other charges. Town in mourning: Flowers cover the grave of Herbert Proffitt on Wednesday . 'I feel like he probably thought everybody was against him, and everything that happened to him was not his fault,' Ford said. 'He didn't want to accept the truth of who really put him in the position he's been in in life, and he wanted to blame that on somebody else.' Wanda Cleary, who lives near Hammer's farmstead in rural Monroe County, said he had a reputation for being mean. 'I didn't know him that well, but I knew him enough that I didn't want to be around him,' she said. Now, investigators say it was Proffitt who arrested Hammer in 2002. Records show he was charged with harassment, disorderly conduct and resisting arrest. He was eventually convicted of harassment. He was acquitted of resisting arrest, and the disorderly conduct charge was dismissed. State police say they found copies of Hammer's arrest citations when they searched his home after Proffitt's death. Years earlier, Hammer was convicted of wanton endangerment and sentenced to a year in state prison. He served less than two months under a policy called shock probation. In memory: Tompkinsville Police Chief Dale Ford holds a photo of his former colleague and predecessor, Herbert Proffitt . Hammer comes from a big family that includes three brothers who live in the area. He is divorced and two of his daughters live in the area - one is a school teacher, the other works at a bank. He lived on a family farm near town, but what he did for a living was a mystery, residents said. Up until the August 28 shooting, Hammer was routinely seen around town but kept to himself. 'You could meet him on the streets and he wouldn't acknowledge you, he'd just keep on a going,' Ford said. Cleary said Hammer once asked her out on a date, a few years after her husband had died. 'I told him I didn't need no man,' she said. The outburst of violence involving two men both in their 80s added to the shock of the tragedy. 'Usually a man gets religion,' McClendon said. 'He has a fear of God and he decides to change his life if there was an old feud a going on. I've seen it happen so many times. ... But sometimes people don't let grudges go.'","82-year-old Herbert Proffitt shot dead outside his home as he went to fetch the mail .

The plane they were originally booked on ended up plummeting to the ground minutes after take off, incinerating all 19 people on board in a terrifying inferno. 'I feel so guilty that I was getting annoyed with her,' Smit told the New York Daily News. 'If she’d been quicker, we wouldn’t be here together today.' Instead of catching the fatal flight, the couple were booked on the second of three flights set to fly foreign trekkers to the Everest region that day. 'All trekkers book through agencies, not airlines, so we all know it was sure luck that our agency put us on another airline when we got there,' Smit said. The couple, and fellow passengers on the later flights, were unaware of the horrific tragedy that saw the twin-engine propeller plane crash and burn just 547 yards from the airport until they popped out to get a coffee. 'We went to a restaurant for coffee and it was breaking news,' he said. 'We just stared at the burning wreckage of the first plane on the television.'

He works under the pseudonym Dito Von Tease, in reference to the burlesque dancer Dita and because 'il dito' means 'the finger'. The 'Ditology' project aims to look at our sense of identity and how we use disguises - particularly when we leave a 'digital fingerprint' online. It all started three years ago, when Von Tease, 33, was looking for an original avatar to use as his profile picture on Facebook. Von Tease said he chose a finger as a disguise because he was not keen to reveal his identity. He said: 'In Italian someone could say I wanted to ""hide myself behind my finger [trans: nascondermi dietro un dito]"" - it's a metaphor to indicate a not-very-effective hiding place. Odd extremity: Fictional characters such as Shrek, left, and Star Trek's Spock, right, are at the tip of the artist's fingers . It's a funny fing: These pictures brilliantly capture the spirit of Disney's Mickey Mouse, left, and Avatar's Neytiri, right . 'I used this metaphor to say we all try to hide ourselves behind an image of us we create. That's my finger, the changing masks everybody wears in playing life... especially famous people.' The characters are chosen from daily news and important happenings, historical events, arts, music, television and politics. Von Tease changes the skin colour and adds hairstyles, distinctive features and even make up. Other recognisable faces that Von Tease has digitally altered include Kiss star Gene Simmons, to whom he added black and white facepaint, a wild hairstyle and even a pink tongue. Digitally altered: The Italian's versions of Hannibal Lecter, left, and Colonel Gaddafi, right, force us to confront our vivid perception of these faces . Handymen: Images of Mozart, left, and grease's Danny Zuko, right, also appear in the diverse collection of faces from fiction, current affairs and the arts . His Sherlock Holmes wears a green hat and smokes a pipe, while his version of Apple founder Steve Jobs sports glasses and bushy grey eyebrows. Von Tease has even put his finger on the perfect look for fictional characters Spock from Star Trek, Disney's Mickey Mouse and animated monster Shrek. He has tackled all the A-Team character as well as John Travolta's Danny Zuko in Grease. The Ditology project also taps into the importance of the index finger in today's digital world - where many of us use our index finger to operate touchscreens. So if you want to examine your own 'digital identity', perhaps it is time to turn back to finger painting.

A group of care home staff have been sacked after allegedly mimicking elderly residents and trying on their clothes then posting the pictures on Facebook. Five workers at Bramble Hollow care home, in Hetton-le-Hole, Tyne and Wear, have been dismissed following the ‘appalling’ incidents. It is understood they posed for photographs while dressed in the elderly residents’ clothes before posting the pictures on the social networking site. Five workers were sacked from Bramble Hollow care home, in Hetton-le-Hole, Tyne and Wear . Residents and relatives at the purpose-built home for over 55s have told how they have been left shocked by the incident. A Bramble Hollow resident said: ‘I keep myself to myself, but I’ve heard things. I heard rumours of staff wearing old people’s clothes, I think in the home.’ A visitor to the home, who did not want to be named, said: ‘We heard that people had been sacked. Staff allegedly posted pictures of themselves wearing residents' clothes onto Facebook . ‘Apparently it was for messing round, which isn’t very nice for the people here.’ Housing 21, which runs Bramble Hollow, confirmed an investigation has been carried out into the allegations, which resulted in five members of staff being dismissed. Victoria Barclay, regional operations director for Housing 21, said: ‘A recent investigation led to the dismissal of five members of our care staff at Bramble Hollow. ‘Housing 21 has a strict social media policy in place to protect customers and staff and any breach of this policy is taken very seriously.’ Age UK Sunderland boss Alan Patchett has slammed the behaviour of the staff involved. He said: ‘I am shocked that this type of behaviour should go on in care premises in Sunderland. ‘It’s absolutely appalling that care workers should display such a lack of respect towards the residents in their care.’ Bramble Hollow was opened in 2011 and consists of 48 purpose built apartments - it also has on-site care and support services.","Five workers at over 55s care home in Tyne and Wear have been sacked .

Users would be able to log-in to state agency websites and apps with their Facebook username and password. Allowing people to use existing online profiles to access government information will mean an end to remembering multiple passwords . Details have yet to be finalised but other options being considered include using banking or online shopping details to access government websites. The new Gov.uk site will allow people to use existing online profiles to stop them having to remember multiple passwords. The Cabinet Office wants to 'prevent ‘login fatigue’ [from] having too many usernames and passwords'. However, there are fears it could make it easier for hackers to exploit personal information. Additional security questions re expected to be added to limit the chances of fraud. Cabinet Office staff, who have travelled to the US for talks with the White House to secure the new system,  is working with the Post Ofﬁce, mobile phone companies and IT firms including Facebook, Google, Microsoft, PayPal and BT on the project. The first big test of the scheme will come next year when the Department of Work and Pensions launches its Universal Credit system which is due to replace a raft of benefits into a single payment.

Bungling air traffic controllers misunderstood a piece of aircraft jargon which could have prevented a 122mph mid-air collision that killed five people, an inquest heard today. Pilot Brian Normington, 70, was killed when his kit-built Rand KR-2 one-seater aircraft crashed into a twin-engine Cessna 402C plane 700ft above Coventry Airport four years ago in August 2008. Sophie Hastings, 28 - the pilot of the Cessna, codenamed G-EYES - and her three colleagues, John ‘Harvey’ Antrobus, 28, James Beagley, 34, and Sybille Gautrey, 33, also died. Died in crash: Pilot Brian Normington (left), 70, was killed when his kit-built Rand KR-2 one-seater aircraft crashed into a twin-engine Cessna 402C plane - carrying four people, including Sybille Gautrey, 33 (right) Killed: John ‘Harvey’ Antrobus (left), 28, and James Beagley (right), 34, were also on the Cessna which crashed . The Cessna, which belonged to aerial survey company Reconnaissance Ventures, was conducting a routine training flight at the time, an inquest at Leamington Justice Centre heard. The night before the crash the company told air traffic controllers they would be flying at high speed into the airport as part of an exercise to train pilots how to land in bad weather. But controllers allegedly failed to understand that the terminology for the exercise - ILS calibration work - meant the plane would be flying at low levels into the airport. The training requires pilots to fly at 122mph towards the runway before suddenly pulling up at 50ft and flying away. Geraint Herbert, a senior inspector at the Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB), said: ‘Air traffic control was unaware of the nature of G-EYES's flight. ‘The company told air traffic control the night before they were going to be doing ILS calibration work but the person who took the message didn’t know what that meant. Investigation: Aerial photograph showing the scene after five people were killed in a mid-air collision near Coombe Abbey Country Park in Warwickshire in August 2008 . ‘They ticked the box “Instrument Rating Training” which would mean it would be likely to be flying normal speeds. The full implication of G-EYES's fast speed was not considered.’ 'The company told air traffic control the night before they were going to be doing ILS calibration work but the person who took the message didn’t know what that meant' Geraint Herbert, Air Accidents Investigation Branch . The Cessna was cleared to approach to land third in sequence behind Mr Normington’s plane, code named G-BOLZ, the court heard. Mr Herbert said radar controllers at Coventry Airport instructed Mr Normington to alter his flight path when they realised the two planes were on a collision course. But tragically the two aircraft crashed seconds after air traffic control informed the Cessna about Mr Normington’s altered plans. The inspector said he believed the planes . collided at 122mph and it was possible Mr Normington’s small plane . would only have been visible from the Cessna for seven to 19 seconds . before the crash. Prior notice: The night before the crash the company told air traffic controllers they would be flying at high speed into the airport as part of an exercise to train pilots how to land in bad weather . Air traffic controllers allegedly failed to tell Mr Normington where the Cessna was in relation to his plane. 'Air traffic control must pass . sufficient information to pilots to enable them to avoid collision. If . pilots are alerted to the presence of an aircraft then they are eight . times more likely to see it' Geraint Herbert . Mr Herbert added: ‘The “see and avoid” principle was compromised by the constant relative bearing between the aircraft, the small size of G-BOLZ and the fast speed of G-EYES. ‘The majority of her attention was probably directed inside the cockpit. The pilot in the right-hand seat was the safety pilot and G-BOLZ would have been obstructed from that right-hand pilot. ‘Air traffic control must pass sufficient information to pilots to enable them to avoid collision. If pilots are alerted to the presence of an aircraft then they are eight times more likely to see it. Investigation: The first plane came down here - near Coombe Abbey, Brinklow, five miles from Coventry Airport. The second aircraft crashed in nearby Brandon Woods . ‘No information was given to the pilot of G-BOLZ (Mr Normington) regarding the presence of G-EYES. And ambiguous information was given to the pilot of G-EYES (Miss Hastings) regarding the presence of G-BOLZ.’ Coroner Sean McGovern said: ‘We are looking into the deaths of five people. Five people died when two aircraft collided in mid-air. It was August 17, 2008. It was a morning. It was a Sunday. ‘Mr Normington was in his own aircraft on his own. The other aircraft had everyone else in. The two women were sitting in the front and the two men were in the back seats. ‘The purpose of their flight was to carry out flight calibration training. Around 10.36am they both were approaching the runway at Coventry Airport. In mid-air they collided and the five people all died.’ The inquest is expected to last for a week.","Pilot Brian Normington, 70, was killed .

A schoolboy detective has helped to snare minibus drivers using their mobile phones while taking children to school in a seven-seater vehicle. Dylan Ewers, 14, used his phone to catch the two drivers on camera as they broke the law while on the school run. His videos were used as evidence to convict John Phillips, 41, and Leslie Seswick, 40, who were both employed to drive children living in rural areas to school on the minibus. Scroll down for video . John Phillips was filmed by schoolboy Dylan Ewers using his mobile phone while driving a minibus on the school run . Each landed a £500 fine and given three penalty points after Dylan became concerned that the drivers flouted the road rules, using their mobile phones while negotiating winding country roads in South Wales. The footage was enough to convict the pair after school officials passed it on to police. Dylan said that pupils were left scared on the school run to King Henry VIII Comprehensive in Abergavenny, claiming that the drivers mounted kerbs and one had even pulled out in front of a lorry, frightening the children on board. Prosecutor Jean Munton told . Abergavenny Magistrates’ Court in South Wales: ‘Dylan told his mother . that some of the drivers concerned him by using their mobile phones . while on the five-mile run to school. ‘He . filmed the drivers using his Blackberry on two successive days and the . footage was downloaded to a lap top and burned onto disc.’ Enough to convict: The footage, which also caught Leslie Seswick using his phone while driving children living in rural areas to school, pictured, was filmed on the teenager's Blackberry .

Exciting images from NASA's Curiosity rover show exactly what your eyes would see if you were standing on the surface of Mars on a late afternoon day. The excellent panoramic image is the first colour landscape photograph provided from the $2.5 billion Martian rover and was taken with the probe's MastCams which extend above the the spacecraft. The panoramic mosaic, comprising 130 separate images that Curiosity captured with its newly activated navigation cameras, shows a rust-colored, pebble-strewn expanse stretching to a wall of the crater's rim in one direction and a tall mound of layered rock in another. A handout photo provided by US Space Agency NASA on 09 August 2012 shows the first 360-degree panorama in color of the Gale Crater landing site taken by NASA's Curiosity rover . That formation, named Mount Sharp, stands at the center of the vast, ancient impact crater and several miles from where Curiosity touched down at the end of an eight-month voyage across 352 million mile (566 million km) of space. The layers of exposed rock are thought to hold a wealth of Mars' geologic history, making it the main target of exploration for scientists who will use the rover to seek evidence of whether the planet most similar to Earth might now harbor or once have hosted key ingredients for microbial life. The mission controllers also released the rover's first self-portrait which was stitched together to show an uninterrupted view of Curiosity standing on the surface of the Red Planet. Eight shots were used to create the panoramic picture using the rover's twin navigation cameras, or Navcam which are used to capture 3D images. The 360-degree panorama was created by Nasa staff by electronically stitching together eight shots from the rover . Michael Malin, principal investigator, Mars Descent Imager, watches the amazing panoramic image being built up on screen . The new also reveal more about Curiosity's arrival on the red planet. Blast marks from the rocket engine's that brought the car sized rover can clearly be seen in the image below, which forms part of the panorama. Scientists believe that the soil on mars is relatively shallow, which will help Curiosity's instruments get access to the underlying rock easily. 'These Navcam images indicate that our powered descent stage did more than give us a great ride, it gave our science team an amazing freebie,' said John Grotzinger, project scientist for the mission from the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena. 'The thrust from the rockets actually dug a one-and-a-half-foot-long [0.5 meter] trench in the surface. 'It appears we can see Martian bedrock on the bottom. Its depth below the surface is valuable data we can use going forward.' The panorama reveals dark marks on the surface caused tby the lander's rocket engines as it descended . Nasa has also released more self portraits taken by the rover, which they have been using to check for signs of damage. Visible in the photograph are pebbles . resting on the top of the craft which have been kicked up by the landing . of the multi-billion dollar exploration vehicle. However, mission controllers believe the craft is, so far, responding perfectly to their commands. A handout photo provided by US Space Agency NASA on 09 August 2012 shows full-resolution self-portrait of the deck of NASA's Curiosity rover from the rover's Navigation cameras. Pebbles are visible on the top . Part of the deck of NASA's Curiosity rover on Mars, taken from one of the rover's Navigation cameras looking toward the back left of the rover . But mission controllers at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory near Los Angeles are exercising caution immediately following Curiosity's jarring, death-defying descent to the surface on Sunday night. They plan to spend weeks putting the nuclear-powered, six-wheeled rover and its sophisticated array of instruments through a painstaking series of 'health' checks before embarking on the thrust of their science mission in earnest. The $2.5 billion Curiosity project, formally named the Mars Science Laboratory, is NASA's first astrobiology mission since the Viking probes of the 1970s and is touted as the first fully equipped mobile geochemistry lab ever sent to a distant world. Earth-like landscape: This image released by NASA and taken by cameras aboard the Curiosity rover shows the Martian horizon scientists say resembles the Mojave Desert . Comparing: The Mojave Desert stretches throughout southeastern and central California as well as southern Nevada, southwestern Utah and northwestern Arizona, in the United States . A strange blob is visible on the left . Conspiracy theorists have already worked themselves up into a lather over a mysterious blotch visible in the first black and white photographs taken from NASA's new Curiosity rover as it landed on Mars. However, two hours later when the satellite made another pass over Curiosity, the rover sent another batch of images that revealed that the blotch had disappeared. After three full days on the Red Planet, 'Curiosity continues to behave flawlessly' and has 'executed all planned activities' without a hitch, mission manager Michael Watkins said at a JPL news briefing. The latest round of equipment checks included an instrument designed to determine mineral composition of powdered rock and soil samples; one to analyze soil and atmospheric samples for organic compounds; one to detect traces of water locked in shallow mineral deposits; and another that uses particle X-rays to identify chemical elements in rocks and soils. The very delivery of Curiosity to the surface of Mars already has been hailed by NASA as the greatest feat of robotic spaceflight. The car-sized rover, which flew from Earth encased in a protective capsule, blasted into the Martian sky at hypersonic speed and landed safely seven minutes later after an elaborate, daredevil descent combining a giant parachute with a rocket-pack that lowered the rover to the Martian surface on a tether. Since then, the rover has been . sending a string of early images back to Earth, relayed by two NASA . satellites orbiting Mars, providing glimpses of a terrain that . scientists say appear reminiscent of the Mojave Desert in Southern . California. One shot . beamed back late Wednesday night, the first taken by Curiosity of . itself, shows the rover's top deck strewn with dark pebbles apparently . kicked up from the ground when the craft landed. NASA scientists said . the gravel does not appear to pose any risk to instruments on the . vehicle. Two separate high-resolution 'Navcam' images taken of the surface show that thrust from the sky-crane rockets . during descent carved out a 1.5-foot (0.5-meter) trench in the surface, . exposing what appears to be Martian bedrock underneath. When . Curiosity wakes up for its fourth day on Mars, early Friday California . time, mission controllers plan to conduct additional instrument checks . and prepare the craft for an upgrade of its main computer software for . surface operations. All other activities will be suspended during that . upgrade, which will begin on day 5 of the mission and last four days.

She worked as a waitress, living off-campus and went back to college this summer, changing her major and focusing on becoming an elementary school teacher. She shared an apartment with a fellow student Karena Rosario, originally from New Jersey. Miss Rosario had a boyfriend, 21-year-old Takoy Jones but the relationship fell apart. The two young women were forced to change the locks after Jones reportedly kicked their doors in.  Miss Rosario also took a restaining order out against her former boyfriend. At the time of Miss Hedgepeth's murder, Mr Jones, told ABC that she was the ‘sweetest person in the world' and that whoever killed her 'deserves to burn'. Victim: Faith Hedgepeth, a UNC student and a member of the Haliwa-Saponi tribe of Hollister, North Carolina, was found dead in her home on September 7 . Murdered: Police have not revealed how Hedgepeth, right, was killed or whether they have made any arrests in connection with her murder . Her father Roland Hedgepeth told the Charlotte Observer: 'From day one, I’ve been worried about Faith there. I’m looking at and questioning every scenario.' Authorities have refused to elaborate . on how the student was killed . in her home, which is three miles from the main UNC campus. Emergency crews referred to blood at the scene but carpet and walls had been stripped for forensic testing. In . an email alert to the UNC community last month, chancellor Holden Thorp said: 'I . am sorry to let you know of the sudden death of one of our students... law enforcement officials do not believe that there is danger to other . students, faculty or staff. ' Former roommate: Takoy Jones, 21, had once lived at the apartment with his ex-girlfriend Karena Rosario before Miss Hedgepeth died . Investigation: Hedgepeth was found dead in her apartment, three miles from UNC campus . The Haliwa-Saponi tribe is the third-largest Native American tribe in North Carolina. Comprised of 3,800 people, the tribe is a close-knit rural community who live within a 10-mile radius on the Halifax County/Warren County line. The tribe received state recognition in 1965 and is in the process of seeking full federal recognition. Members are the descendants of three tribes who inhabited the area prior to European settlement and conflict. Members originally called themselves Indians but began using the Haliwa name in the 1950s. In 1979, Saponi was added to the name in recognition of an ancient tribe from which many are descended.  Life largely revolves around the Protestant religion.The tribe is governed by an elected eleven-member Council, including an elected Chief and Vice-Chief. In 2000, the tribe opened a new school for its members. Source: The Charlotte Observer . More than 1,000 people from the Haliwa-Saponi tribe gathered to grieve Hedgepeth’s death during the tribe’s annual powwow in September. According to her friends, Hedgepeth planned to return to live with the Native American tribe, which has about 4,000 members, after she finished her studies. Rolanda Hedgepeth told the Charlotte Observer that her sister loved her ancestry and her church. Her church’s pastor, Willie Pastor, said: 'You send a child off to college and you think they will be safe. This throws your whole balance in life off.' Friends say that Hedgepeth wanted to be a paediatrician or a teacher and described the teenager as ‘the sweetest person ever.' Hedgepeth's murder is the second at UNC in four years. In . 2008, student president Eve Carson was kidnapped from her home and . taken to a series of ATMs to withdraw money before being murdered. One killer pleaded guilty to Carson's murder and another was found guilty earlier this year.

The UN has finally condemned Syria for shelling a Turkish border town in an attack that left five civilians dead. The UN Security Council released a joint statement two days after the assault took place on the border between the two countries. The delayed response comes as Syrian warplanes and artillery . continue to pound the cities of Homs, and Aleppo - killing and injuring civilians. WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT . Destruction: Damage from shelling by forces loyal to Syria's President Bashar al-Assad in the northern city of Aleppo. The Assad regime's military campaign has shown no let-up despite escalating tensions with Turkey . Survivor: A Syrian civilian, wounded from shelling on a refugee centre by government forces, receives treatment at the Dar al-Shifa hospital in Aleppo. The city has been a focal point of the conflict since mid-July . Victim: A badly injured Syrian civilian is treated for his wounds in Aleppo. Civilians and children have become regular casualties during the ongoing conflict . The reported tank, mortar and airstrikes come alongside a push by government forces on the embattled northern city of Aleppo. The UN response to the cross border shelling was reportedly delayed after Russia, an ally of Syria, blocked an earlier draft of the statement. The statement said the attack showed the impact the Syrian crisis was having on peace and stability in the region. An earlier draft, blocked by Russia, included the phrase 'international peace and security,' the BBC reports. Ankara's parliament on Thursday . authorised cross-border military operations following the Syrian attack. Turkey's planes pounded targets inside Syria for two days in retaliation for the killings. Although . both Damascus and Ankara moved Thursday to calm tensions, the . parliament's approval of the cross border operations made it clear that . Turkey is retaining a military option if threatened. Turkish Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan warned Syria in a speech in Istanbul on Friday not to make a ‘fatal mistake’ by testing Turkey’s patience as the Turkish army retaliated for a third day running after more mortar rounds from Syria landed on its soil. Desperate: Civilians in Aleppo have suffered months of shelling by government forces. Hospital staff have battled to deal with the number of badly wounded who arrive for treatment (pictured above) Suffering: A Syrian boy, wounded by the shelling, sits close to a dead body at the Dar al-Shifa hospital in Aleppo . Loss: A man grieves the loss of his relatives killed in the shelling of Aleppo. Forces loyal to the government had promised the 'mother of all battles' to clear the city of rebels . Speaking to a large crowd in the . Turkish capital, Prime Minister Erdogan warned that although Turkey do . not want war, they will not be intimidated by Syria. ‘We are not interested in war, but . we're not far from war either. This nation has come to where it is today . having gone through intercontinental wars,’ Mr Erdogan said in his . speech. ‘Those who attempt to test Turkey's deterrence, its decisiveness, its capacity, I say here they are making a fatal mistake.’ At least two mortar bombs fired from . Syria landed in farmland in Turkey's southern Hatay province on Friday, . one of them around 50 metres into Turkish territory, and a military unit . responded immediately, Hatay Governor Celalettin Lekesiz was quoted as . saying by the state-run Anatolian news agency. A Syrian boy and his father lay critically wounded from shelling on a refugee centre by government forces (above left and right) Turkish broadcaster NTV said Syria . had given the order for its warplanes and helicopters not to enter an . area within 10 km (six miles) of the Turkish border and had ordered its . artillery units not to fire shells in areas close to the border. There was no confirmation of this from the Syrian authorities. In the United States, representatives from the White house have expressed support for Turkey’s retaliation against Syria. ‘The United States condemns the . violence and the aggressive actions of the Syrians,’  a White House . spokesman told reporters travelling with President Barack Obama to . Cleveland. ‘The Turks have taken some actions . that are designed to ensure that their sovereignty is no longer violated . by Syrian aggression and we stand shoulder-to-shoulder with them as . they take those actions. They are certainly appropriate.’ Patrol: Turkish soldier stands guard in an armoured personnel carrier on the Turkish-Syrian border near the Akcakale border crossing . The . stepped-up pace of Syrian government attacks on rebel-held areas nevertheless suggests that . the Damascus regime's forces have not been distracted by escalating . tensions with Turkey. Activist . Mohammed Saeed, who is based in the Damascus suburb of Douma, said . rebels captured an air defense base in the Eastern Ghouta area near the . capital. A . video showed dozens of gunmen outside an area where smoke was . billowing. One of the gunmen says that a 'missile air defense battalion' was captured. Another video showed missiles inside a room. Mr Saeed . said the rebels claimed to have captured the base on Monday. If confirmed, the capture of a stock . of working anti-aircraft missiles would be a boost to a lightly-armed . force. The British-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said Friday's attack on Homs is the worst on the city for five months. The . Observatory, which relies on a network of activists on the ground, said . the bombardment had hit the city's Khaldiya neighborhood. On alert: Turkish soldiers gesture as they stand guard near the Turkish-Syria border in the southern Sanliurfa province . Armed and ready: A Turkish soldier watches for attack from Syria . 'Around dawn, the regime went crazy and started shelling hysterically,' a Homs-based activist known as Abu Rami said on Friday. 'An average of five rockets a minute are falling.' Abu Rami was speaking from the central rebel-held old quarter known as Old Homs. He said the government forces are . mainly firing rockets and heavy mortars at the rebel-held neighborhoods . of Old Homs, Khaldiya, Qusour and Jouret el-Shayah. Abu . Rami also said the Assad regime's forces have been shelling villages . around Homs and the rebel-held town of Rastan, just north of the city. The . Observatory also said the Syrian military has been shelling the . neighborhood of Sakhour in Aleppo as government forces battle rebels in . the country's largest city. No fear: A boy rides a horse past Turkish soldiers near the Syria border . State-run Syrian TV said that government forces 'cleansed Sakhour of terrorists and mercenaries.' The transformation of the conflict into an open war has attracted in foreign fighters and extremists, analysts say. The . uprising against President Assad erupted in March 2011 and gradually morphed into . a bloody civil war which has so far killed around 30,000 people. Turkey deployed troops along the border with Syria today - with soldiers seen patrolling the area on foot and in armored personnel vehicles. People . in the border town of Akcakale, where the Syrian shell landed on . Wednesday, feared more violence in the volatile border area. Halil Deniz, who lives in Oncul, says . he still fears for his life. Oncul is a village on the Turkey-Syria . border where people fled from Akcakale. On the move: Turkish soldiers walk as they keep guard on the Turkish-Syrian border following Syrian attacks . Life goes on: Goats pass in front of Turkish soldiers, not far from where artillery shells were flying overhead two days earlier . 'We do not know if we will live or die,' Deniz said. 'Children go to other villages in the evenings, and return back when the next day dawns.' 'Our store owners, our citizens and our children are all very concerned. 'We did not sleep until morning,' said Ahmet Sabritur, who lives in Akcakale. He . praised Turkey's military response to the Syrian shelling, saying that . Damascus should be made aware that deaths of Turkish civilians will not . go unpunished. 'If our government had not retaliated, maybe it could have been worse,' Sabritur said.

A disgusted NFL player ripped his team's hometown fans after they cheered loudly while his quarterback was injured on the field. The fan response came as Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Matt Cassel was knocked out of the game on Sunday by a Baltimore Ravens defender about 100 pounds heavier, causing him to suffer a head injury. Cassel sustained a concussion in the fourth quarter hit, and had to be helped off the field before the Chiefs ultimately lost 9-6. Scroll down for video . Brutality: Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Matt Cassel is surrounded by trainers and teammates after he suffered a head injury against the Baltimore Ravens on Sunday . Enraged: After the game, Eric Winston ripped Kansas City Chiefs fans for cheering while Cassel was sidelined . Instead of showing concern for the fallen QB, a section of fans - who blame Cassel for the team’s woeful 1-4 start - cheered. The response enraged Cassel’s teammates. Among them was offensive tackle Eric . Winston, who lambasted fans as reporters surrounded him in the locker . room after the game. He told reporters: 'I think it's . sickening and disgusting. We are not gladiators and this is not the . Roman Colosseum. This is a game. This is a game that's going to cost us a . lot down the road. That's OK. We picked it. Examined: Cassel is looked after by Chiefs doctors after taking the brutal hit from Baltimore Ravens defensive tackle Haloti Ngata . ‘We deserve it. I don't want your pity. But we've got a lot of problems as a society if people think that's OK.' On Monday, Winston stood by his remarks the day before, and added: 'It might have been 7,000, might have been 700, but it was still too many. I was directing those comments at a few people, and when I say a few people, I do mean a few people, because I don't think it was the majority of people or even the vast minority of people.' Even the Ravens 330-pound defensive tackle Haloti Ngata, who issued the punishing blow on Cassel, thought the fan reaction was uncalled for. Ngata told ESPN: 'For them to cheer for him being hurt, that's just not cool.' Ngata added: 'Hopefully, he bounces back and gets better.' Prior to the game some fans paid for a plane to hover over Arrowhead Stadium, towing a banner that pleaded for Cassel to be benched and for Chiefs GM Scott Pioli to be fired. Due to his injury, Cassel is likely to be sidelined for at least next weekend's game against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Chiefs coach Romeo Crennel did not rule out Cassel's return to the field this week, but said the team is putting safety first. Crennel . said: 'Some individuals recover faster than others, but with the . emphasis on concussions in the league, they're making sure we do due . diligence with the player's health, making sure he's not rushed back, so . we'll see.'

Dazed: Trainers assist Kansas City Chiefs Cassel during the fourth quarter hit in the Chiefs' 9-6 loss to the Ravens . The fans' blasé attitude to Cassel's . concussion fails to take into consideration the seriousness of head . injuries - and their fatal effects - in the NFL. Several players in recent years, including Tennessee Titan O.J. Murdock and Atlanta Falcons' Ray Easterling, have committed suicide months or years after suffering head injuries. In another indication that blows to . the head may cause serious trouble, a study in September discovered that . football players are three times more likely to die from degenerative . brain disease. The death rate from Alzheimer's, . Parkinson's and Lou Gehrig's disease combined was about three times of . that for the general U.S. population, researchers from the National . Institute for Occupational Safety and Health reported. The fans' blasé attitude to Cassel's concussion fails to take into consideration the seriousness of head injuries - and their fatal effects - in the NFL. In the past two years, the suicides of six NFL players have been linked to chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), which is caused by repeated blows to the head. Sufferers can show symptoms such as memory loss, aggression, confusion . and depression which may appear within months or many . decades later. Later in life it can eventually cause dementia. Experts believe CTE may be caused by the loss of neurons and scarring of . brain tissue among other injuries caused by repeated concussion. It changes brain cells' cytoskeletons, which is thought to be due to . damage to cerebral blood vessels. The condition is virtually . indistinguishable from Alzheimer’s. Players who have committed suicide in recent years, with possible links to the condition, include: . Dave Duerson: Two-time Super Bowl winner Dave Duerson shot himself in February 2011 after texting family members asking for his brain to be examined for CTE. Wade Belak: Former Nashville Predator Wade Belak was found dead in September 2011, having hanged himself in a Toronto hotel room. Junior Seau: In May 2012 Junior Seau, of the San Diego Chargers, died of a gunshot wound to the chest. He was found by his girlfriend at his home in California.

Gunned down: College freshman Gil Collar (left) was shot dead by a campus police officer, identified as Trevis Austin (right), after taking LSD and acting erratically, authorities have revealed . He had come outside the police headquarters when he heard Collar, a 5-foot-7, 135-pound former high school . wrestler, banging on its door, Cochran said. Surveillance footage showed Collar naked and covered in sweat as he chased the officer for more than 50 feet, Fox News reported. When the student got within five feet of the officer, Austin, who was not armed with pepper spray or a baton, as is required of campus officers, shot once and struck him in the chest. 'Had the officer had a Taser or some other less lethal instrument I . don't know if that officer would have had an opportunity to shoulder his . pistol and to use something else because the events were evolving so . rapidly and he was approaching so close,' Cochran said. He added that he had been extremely concerned when first hearing about the shooting, but understood why the officer had chosen to open fire after watching the video. The authorities will not be releasing the footage publicly, he added. Loss: Gilbert with his mother Bonnie, who said footage of the killing showed he had not touched the officer . Loss: Friends and family, including Collar's mother, right, said that the police officer should have been better equipped to deal with the intoxicated teenager. He was not carrying his baton or pepper spray . Investigators are now looking into . who gave Collar the LSD and could charged them with murder. Cochran . revealed that people at the concert with the teenager had told them . about his drug use. LSD, . is a semisynthetic psychedelic drug also known as acid. It is usually . added to absorbent paper, such as blotter paper, divided into small . squares and taken orally. The . effects of LSD are unpredictable and depend on the amount taken, the . user's personality and mood, and the surroundings in which the drug is . used. It can cause anxiety, panic, paranoia, psychotic . behavior and an inability to recognize danger. If taken in a large enough dose, the drug produces delusions and visual hallucinations. Physical . effects include dilated pupils, higher body temperature, increased . heart rate and blood pressure, sweating, loss of appetite, . sleeplessness, dry mouth, and tremors. The effects of LSD last for hours, typically clearly after 12 hours. LSD, which is also . known as acid, can cause anxiety, paranoia, psychotic . behavior and an inability to recognise danger, effects which typically last for around 12 hours. The revelations come after Collar's . mother, Bonnie Smith Collar, said the surveillance video shows that her . son never came into physical contact with the officer. Acquaintances had said that Collar appeared to be . intoxicated as he took his . clothes off, ran through the streets, screamed obscenities and claimed . he was on a 'spiritual quest' before he was killed. 'Whatever caused the incident was something that made him act not in his normal personality,' she said. Mrs Collar said she had no idea why . her son would be acting erratically as described and that the slight yet . strong boy had never posed a threat before. 'The . first thing on my mind is, freshman kids do stupid things,' she said. 'Campus police should be equipped to handle activity like that without . having to use lethal force.'

Brandon Ross, a . sophomore at Jacksonville State University, said Collar moved to the . neighborhood as an eight-year-old. 'I was the first person he met on the bus, and we've been friends ever since,' he said. 'He was the kid everybody liked.' 'It's completely opposite of the way . he was,' said South Alabama student Chandler Wescovich of Long Beach, . Miss., who became friends with Collar during his short time on campus.

The 49-year-old, who has not been named, told a Cologne district court that the prostitute - a mother-of-three - became aggressive after ingesting cocaine, and ended up keeping him tied on his bed beyond their agreed two-hour session. She allegedly held a knife to his throat - while he was tied up - and demanded his PIN details. However the prostitute denies his story - and because of the amount of cocaine in both people's systems, the court said it was possible one or both of them were hallucinating details, making it difficult to ascertain the truth. According to TheLocal.de, the undertaker said: I just wanted some erotic role-play, not to be dominated. He claimed he was forced to swallow cocaine, and that the dominatrix stole €980 from his bank account. However the dominatrix said her client asked her to stay after his first two hours, and also asked if she could find a transsexual to join in.

Sales of Big Bird costumes have skyrocketed in the run-up to Halloween ever since the Sesame Street character found itself thrust into the battle for the U.S. presidency. The 7ft bird has become the centre of frenzied debate after Mitt Romney professed his love for the children's favourite during last week's first presidential debate in Denver. Big Bird now looks set to play a leading role in this year's Halloween celebrations as a number of fancy dress stores have reported a surge of interest in the past few days. Scroll down for make-your-own-bird costume video . Yellow fever: Sales of Big Bird costumes, in particular these 'sassy' versions, have shot up as much as 500 per cent in some stores after the Sesame Street character was mentioned in last week's U.S. presidential debate . Romney's debate trick is a treat for business: The outfits, which come in a variety of designs, but most with a short, yellow dress, orange knee-highs and a bird headband, are flying off the shelves in time for Halloween . A representative from costumecraze.com said it had experienced a 500 per cent increase in sales of the 'sassy Big Bird adult costume' alone. Some versions of the outfit come with a short, yellow dress with orange knee-highs and a bird headband. Meanwhile, other Sesame Street characters - the sassy Cookie Monster and the sassy Elmo costume - had not seen a boost in sales. 'The 500 per cent increase must be due to Big Bird’s increased popularity post-debate,' the representative told ABC News. Mixed messages: Romney told of his fondness for Sesame Street during the presidential debate on PBS, but in the same breath said he would cut funding to the public broadcaster, which airs the children's programme . Debt-buster: Romney told the debate that he was going to stop borrowing money from China to 'pay for things we don't need' Costume World's CEO and founder Marilynn Wick said the avian puppet was also a hit in their stores. 'We have four store locations and all of them are selling out of the Big Bird costumes,' she added. Halloween .

Invention: The top of one of Daniel Gabriel Fahrenheit's thermometers that has been in a private collection for 40 years . One of the original thermometers made by Daniel Gabriel Fahrenheit has sold for more than £67,000. The 300-year-old brass instrument is one of only three known examples of Fahrenheit’s work in existence today. It was thought to have been lost to history until it emerged for sale at Christies in London having been in private ownership for more than 40 years. The 4.5ins tall item got bidders hot under the collar when it went under the hammer, eventually going to an anonymous telephone buyer who paid £67,250 for it. Fahrenheit invented the mercury thermometer in 1714, but it is unknown exactly how many he made. It divided the freezing and boiling points of water into 180 degrees. 32°F was the freezing point of water and 212°F was the boiling point of water, set by Fahrenheit  himself. 0°F . was based on the temperature of an equal mixture of water, ice, and . salt. Fahrenheit based his scale on the temperature of the human . body. The Fahrenheit scale was the first widely used temperature scale. His other great invention was the Fahrenheit scale that is still used today, and which the thermometer is annotated with. Fahrenheit was born in Danzig, in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, into a German Hanse merchant family. His parents died from mushroom poisoning when he was just 15, and he later moved to the Dutch Republic where he spent the rest of his life. He began training as a chemist, and his personal interest in natural science led to his studies and experimentation in the field. They culminated in his inventing the alcohol thermometer, for which he mastered glass blowing, and then the mercury version. The scale on the newly-discovered . thermometer is marked from '0' to '132' degrees F and it is so small . that the numbers had to be written on both sides of the mercury tube. The device is signed 'Fahrenheit Amst', from the time the inventor worked in Amsterdam, where he made it. Signed by the inventor: He has marked the thermometer with 'Amst', short for Amsterdam, where he made it . Great inventor: Fahrenheit had a strong interest in natural science and was fascinated by new inventions . This example has been in a private collection for over 40 years and it was unknown to scientific historians until now. James Hyslop, from auctioneers . Christie’s, said in August when the auction was announced: 'Until now, only two originals were thought to exist. 'And these are both in the Boerhaave Museum in the Netherlands. 'So to have this one emerge is very exciting. 'It . is impossible to pinpoint exactly when it was made, but one in the . museum is dated 1718, and this was probably made between 1715 and 1730. 'He made barometers with thermometers on the side, but this was one was a special scientific thermometer. 'It is only 4.5 inches long and is made of brass and has the Fahrenheit scale down the sides. 'The mercury tube is not the original and has been replaced, but it was clearly designed so the tubes could be taken out. 'It was a thermometer for scientific purposes perhaps for measuring the temperature of liquids. 'Originally it was probably owned by a great scientist of the day.' Roemer (pictured) whom Fahrenheit visited in 1708 and then improved on his scale, the result being the Fahrenheit temperature scale . Fahrenheit was born in Danzig, in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, into a German merchant family in 1686. He began training as a merchant in Amsterdam after his parents died on August 14, 1701, when he was just 15, from eating poisonous mushrooms. He later . moved to the Dutch Republic where he spent the rest of his life and married Concordia Schumann, daughter of a well-known business family. However, Fahrenheit had a strong interest in natural science and was fascinated by new inventions such as the thermometer. He . began training as a chemist, and his personal interest in natural . science led to his studies and experimentation in the field. In 1717, Fahrenheit became a glassblower, making barometers, altimeters, and thermometers. From 1718 onwards, he was a lecturer in chemistry. He visited England in 1724 and was . the same year elected a Fellow of the Royal Society. His interests culminated in him inventing the alcohol thermometer, for which he mastered glass blowing, and then the mercury version. The mercury thermometer, with a standardised Fahrenheit scale, was invented in 1714. The Fahrenheit scale was the first widely used temperature scale. It divided the freezing and boiling points of water into 180 degrees. 32°F was the freezing point of water and 212°F was the boiling point of water, set by Daniel himself. 0°F was based on the temperature of an equal mixture of water, ice, and salt. Daniel Fahrenheit based his scale on the temperature of the human body. Originally, the human body temperature was 100° F on the Fahrenheit scale, but it has since been adjusted to 98.6°F. The thermometer was inspired by Olaus Roemer, a Danish astronomer, in Copenhagen. Roemer had invented a wine thermometer. Roemer's thermometer had two points, 60 degrees as the temperature of boiling water and 7.5 degrees as the temperature of melting ice. At that time, temperature scales were not standardised and everybody made up their own scale. Fahrenheit modified Roemer's design and scale, and thus, invented the new mercury thermometer with a Fahrenheit scale. Fahrenheit died in The Hague in 1736 and was buried there at the Cloister Church. After his death, in 1742, the Celsius scale was invented by Swedish Astronomer Anders Celsius. Also known as the 'centigrade' scale, centigrade means 'consisting of or divided into 100 degrees.' The Celsius scale has 100 degrees between the freezing point (0°C) and . boiling point (100°C) of pure water at sea level air pressure. The term 'Celsius' was adopted in 1948 by an international conference on weights . and measurements. The simplicity of the Celsius scale led to it superseding the Fahrenheit as the universal temperature scale.","It was thought to have been lost to .

The 'Carrier IQ' diagnostic software is used by U.S. phone networks to monitor phone usage - but some users worry that it monitors them a little TOO much. New apps such as Carrier IQ Detector let users find out if the app is installed on their phone . Security experts are divided over whether Carrier IQ - a monitoring 'tool' used by U.S. phone networks to track phone usage - is as sinister as it appears. Last week, a security expert demonstrated the application 'reading' text messages and monitoring web browsing - and then transmitting the data to Carrier IQ. Carrier IQ vigorously defended itself against the charges, saying that the software was just designed for 'diagnostics'. But a new app at least offers Android users peace of mind about the software, by telling them whether the software is installed in their phone. Carrier IQ Detector is downloadable free from Android market, and running the app instantly tells you if the 'diagnostic' software is installed in your phone. 'Security researchers have recently determined that a number of consumer mobile devices contain pre-installed software from Carrier IQ,' says the app's descripction. 'While this software appears to be designed to help mobile network operators improve coverage through metrics tracking, it does not provide a clear opt-out path for users.' 'Additionally, it can be difficult for non-technical users to determine whether or not their handset is affected. We've developed the Carrier IQ Detector to aid in this process in an effort to keep mobile users fully informed about what their phone is doing.' What Carrier IQ Detector can't do, though, is uninstall the Carrier IQ software. It's so deeply embedded in the firmware that it's near-impossible to remove.

British golfer Rachel Connor has escaped jail in the U.S. after she agreed to a plea bargain for a DUI-charge, a Florida court representative said today. The 21-year-old was arrested in March when she was pulled over by police and breathalysed at almost double the legal limit. Ms Connor was returning from a golf event and was busted for drink-driving with married former NFL star Eddie George in the passenger seat. The Manchester-born pro, who competed on the secondary LPGA Futures Tour in 2011, was pulled over near Sarasota, 60 miles south of Tampa. Her passenger, 38-year-old American footballer George, was not arrested, but was forced to release a statement denying allegations of cheating, saying Miss Connor was just a friend who had offered him a lift home, TMZ reports. Before her arrest the pair had been taking part in the Archie Griffin Celebrity Golf Classic at The Concession in east Manatee County. During the evening, Connor tweeted a picture of her posing with George at an event, captioned:  'The lovely Eddie George.' A police report said officers began following the car after they spotted it travelling at 40mph in a 20mph area. The deputy officer wrote that the car then began to weave in the lane and he pulled the vehicle over. The Herald Tribune said the deputy 'smelled a very strong odor of alcoholic beverage' when he approached the vehicle. Miss Connor reportedly failed walking and counting tests and her blood alcohol level was nearly twice the legal limit. She told police she had only consumed two vodka and cranberries during the evening but wished she had not gotten behind the wheel of her car.

The death throes of dying stars have been captured in unprecedented detail by NASA's Chandra X-ray satellite observatory. the images are the culmination of work by two dozen astronomers to image a set of dying stars in the neighborhood of the Sun. The resulting X-ray images of these dying stars—called planetary nebulae—are shedding light on the violent 'end game' of a Sun-like star's life. Four planetary nebulae are shoFour planetary nebulae are shown here from the first systematic survey of these dying, Sun-like stars in the solar neighborhood using the Chandra X-Ray Observatory. X-ray emission from Chandra is colored purple and optical emission from the Hubble Space Telescope is colored red, green and blue. The nebulae are NGC 6543, also known as the Cat's Eye, NGC 7662, NGC 7009 and NGC 6826.wn here from the first systematic survey of these dying, Sun-like stars in the solar neighborhood using the Chandra X-Ray Observatory. A planetary nebula is a dying star that has cast off its outer layers.

The . resulting dazzling objects, bearing names like Cat's Eye, Lemon Slice . and Blue Snowball, are favorite targets of optical and near-infrared . telescopes. The research team, led by Joel Kastner from Rochester Institute of Technology, won seven days of observing time with Chandra in 2011 to survey and image nearly two dozen relatively nearby planetary nebulae, resulting in the most comprehensive X-ray survey to date for such objects. The same team recently won an eight-day time award with Chandra to continue its observing program, and will begin collecting new X-ray data later this year. A planetary nebula is a dying star (recently a 'red giant') that has cast off its outer layers. The . newly exposed, hot core of the star, which will eventually become a white dwarf star, illuminates these ejected layers, while the core's . fast winds sculpt the material into a variety of shapes. The . resulting dazzling objects, bearing names like Cat's Eye, Lemon Slice . and Blue Snowball, are favorite targets of optical and near-infrared . telescopes. 'Planetary nebulae have provided astrophysicists with dying star 'laboratories' for more than a century,' Kastner says. 'They provide test beds for theories of stellar evolution and give us insight into the origin of heavy elements in the universe and on Earth. 'Yet we still don't fully understand why they take on such a dazzling variety of shapes.' The widespread debate among astrophysicists concerning the planetary nebula shaping process led Kastner and postdoctoral fellow Rodolfo Montez Jr. to organize their colleagues to request a large allocation of X-ray satellite observing time to investigate the processes of stellar death and wind collisions in X-rays. 'An X-ray survey of this kind is completely uncharted territory in the planetary nebula world,' Kastner adds. 'Astronomers working in this area agreed that we need large quantities of time to look at as many planetary nebulae as possible, specifically with Chandra.' His team is using X-ray imaging to look 'under the hood' of planetary nebulae. X-rays cut through the illuminated gas and dust, allowing astronomers to investigate the last tens of thousands of years of history of the dying star that threw off its outer sheaths. The nebulae NGC 7009 from the first systematic survey of these dying, Sun-like stars in the solar neighborhood using the Chandra X-Ray Observatory. 'With Chandra's exceptional 'X-ray vision,' we can detect the million-degree plasma inside the discarded shells and probe the energies of the stellar winds that shape them,' Kastner says. In the initial phase of the project, the team collected data for 35 planetary nebulae—21 previously unobserved and 14 pulled from Chandra archival data—all within roughly 5,000 light years of the Sun. The recent award will bump the study to a total of 59 objects from among the roughly 120 planetary nebulae identified within this distance. 'Because they all just happen to lie relatively nearby, we think this group of objects is fairly representative of planetary nebulae in general,' Kastner says. The findings will give theorists material to refine models describing mechanisms that shape planetary nebulae, especially the potential influence of a stellar or even a planetary companion to the dying star.'The ChanPlaNS study provides fresh new insights into the last, dying gasps of stars like the Sun,' Kastner says. 'We expect it will clarify what planetary nebulae can tell us about binary star astrophysics and stellar wind interactions.'Early findings from the study have already helped scientists understand the collision of the fast wind from the exposed core with the ejected atmosphere causes shock waves that produce the diffuse X-ray emission seen in the four images above. The Chandra survey data shows that most planetary nebulae with diffuse X-ray emission have sharp-rimmed shells that were ejected less than 5,000 years ago; these compact inner shells are surrounded by fainter halos of material ejected tens of thousands of years earlier.","Images were taken by NASA's Chandra X-ray satellite observatory .

It may look like the most amazing sporting event ever seen, but in fact this Russian cosmonaut is helping protect himself by throwing a metal ball into space. During a six hour spacewalk, station commander Gennady Padalka and flight engineer Yuri Malenchenko launched the 9kg ball into orbit to help researchers on earth track space debris. They also installed a series of shields to protect the International Space Station from debris. Scroll down for video . Ready to launch: The spherical satellite is seen on the right, being held by an astronaut using a special attachment, whos hand is on the left. The satellite, which is expected to . remain in orbit for about three months, is intended to serve as a target . for Russian engineers working on computer models that evaluate orbital . tracking. It should help them understand how objects move through space, and improve the tracking of the thousands of pieces of debris that litter space. The two veteran cosmonauts sailed through the six-hour spacewalk outside the International Space Station on Monday to prepare the orbital outpost for a new module and better shield its living quarters against small meteorite and debris impacts, officials said. Catch! The spherical satellite is released, as mission controllers tell the cosmonaut 'good throw' Station commander Gennady Padalka and flight engineer Yuri Malenchenko opened the hatch on the station's airlock at 11:37am EDT (1537 GMT) to begin a spacewalk to relocate a construction crane, install debris shields and release the small satellite into orbit. The sphere is sent into space using a bizarre 'space lacrosse' system developed by Russian engineers. Their departure was delayed about an . hour while engineers assessed a leak between the Pirs docking module . and Russian segments of the station, a $100 billion laboratory for . microgravity experiments and technology testing that flies about 250 . miles (400km) above Earth. Success: the metal sphere is released and sent spinning into space by an astronaut (left) wearing a space suit . But the issue was resolved and the experienced spacewalkers more than made up the lost time. Padalka, who was making his ninth . spacewalk, and Malenchenko, on his fifth, moved a hand-operated, 46-foot . (14-meter) crane, called Strela-2, from the outside of Pirs to Zarya, . the cornerstone of the station. Pirs is due to be detached from the station next year to make room for a new Russian laboratory and docking module. The 'space lacrosse' attachment can be clearly seen as the astronaut prepares to move on to the next phase of the spacewalk . The United States completed construction of its part of the outpost last year and retired its three space shuttles. Europe, Japan and Canada also are partners on the project. With the crane in place, the spacewalkers then used a hand tool to launch a 20-pound (nine-kg) spherical satellite on a path behind the space station. 'Nice throw,' a flight director in the Russian mission control centre outside Moscow said through a translator monitoring radio communications with the cosmonauts. The sphere is seen spinning off into distance over earth, where it will be monitored by researchers on earth to improve the accuracy of tracking space debris. The spacewalkers' last major task was to install five debris shields to the outside of the Zvezda module, the crew's primary living quarters. They also retrieved a briefcase-sized experiment that has been exposing various materials to the harsh environment of space and installed two support struts on a ladder. Padalka and Malenchenko returned through an airlock and shut the hatch at 5:28pm EDT (2128 GMT), completing the 163rd spacewalk for station assembly and maintenance. On Aug. 30, Nasa astronaut Sunita Williams and Japanese astronaut Akihiko Hoshide, both station flight engineers, are scheduled to make another spacewalk to replace a power relay unit on the station's truss, set up power cables for the Russian laboratory module scheduled to launch next year and install a thermal cover on a docking port.","Spherical satellite to be tracked as part of project to monitor space debris .

"By . Associated Press and Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 12:52 EST, 15 November 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 14:41 EST, 15 November 2012 . The struggling U.S. Postal Service is reporting a record annual loss totaling $15.9billion, while overall mail volume sinks. The financial losses for the fiscal year 2012 ending on September 30 were nearly $11billion more than the previous year. The numbers cap a tumultuous financial year in which the post office was forced for the first time to default on more than $11billion in payments to avert bankruptcy. Scroll down for video . Massive losses: The financial dive for the U.S. Postal Service in fiscal year 2012 was nearly $11billion more than the previous year . Bloomberg Businessweek reported that the Postal Service burns $250million to operate for a day. Postmaster General Patrick Donahoe says the large losses cannot be sustained. Businessweek quoted Donahoe as saying: 'We are walking a financial tightrope.' The mail agency for months has been urging Congress to pass an overhaul bill to let it trim letter delivery to five days a week and reduce annual payments for future retiree health care. It remains unclear whether House leadership would take up the postal bill in its lame-duck session, due in part to resistance from rural lawmakers about the impact of closures in their communities. While urging quick congressional action, the Postal Service in its legal filings on Thursday assumed a 2013 financial outlook in which Congress fails to act on any legislation, acknowledging the political uncertainty of the situation. Boss: Postmaster General Patrick Donahoe says the large losses cannot be sustained . Such legislation has the backing of Rep Darrell Issa of California, . chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, according to The Wall Street Journal. 'As the nation creeps toward the fiscal cliff, the U.S. Postal Service is clearly marching toward a financial collapse of its own,' said Democrat Sen Tom Carper of Delaware, a sponsor of the Senate bill. 'I am hopeful that now that the . elections are over, my colleagues and I can come together and pass . postal reform legislation so that a final bill can be signed into law by . the end of the year.' Overall, the post office had . operating revenue of $65.2billion in fiscal 2012, down $500million from . the previous year. But expenses climbed to $81billion, up from . $70.6billion, largely due to the health prepayments. Will the mail stop? Without Congressional intervention, the Post Office will run out of money by September 2013 . The annual payment of roughly $5.6billion was deferred for a year in 2011, resulting in a double payment totaling $11.1billion that became due this year. The Postal Service is the only government agency required to make such payments. The post office also has been rocked by declining mail volume as people and businesses continue switching to the Internet in place of letters and paper bills. The number of items mailed in the last year was 159.9 billion pieces, a 5 per cent decrease, much of it in first-class mail. On the plus side, the mail agency reported that its fast-growing shipping services, which include express and priority mail, grew by 9 per cent, helping to offset much of the declining revenue from first-class mail. Last month, the post office said it will increase postage rates on January 27, including a 1-cent increase in the cost of first-class mail, to 46 cents. But the rate increase, which is tied to the rate of overall inflation, will make only a small dent in financial losses. The Postal Service also originally sought to close low-revenue post offices in rural areas to save money, but after public opposition, it is now moving forward with a new plan to keep 13,000 of them open with shorter operating hours. Without legislative changes, it said, annual losses will exceed $21billion by 2016. 'The Postal Service is facing a fiscal cliff of its own, and any unanticipated drop in mail volumes could send the agency over the edge,' said Art Sackler, co-coordinator of the Coalition for a 21st Century Postal Service, a group representing the private sector mailing industry. 'If Congress fails to act, there could be postal slowdowns or shutdowns that would have catastrophic consequences for the 8 million private sector workers whose jobs depend on the mail.' In addition, Bloomberg Businessweek reported that the agency could run out of money by October of next year.","Financial losses in fiscal year were nearly $11billion more than the previous year .

'She said she gave him the nose job he wanted,' he said according to Cincinnati.com. 'She said she couldn't stand to see him deformed (after shooting him in the face.) She said he was vain.' She also said it was in self defense. Grave charge:  Firing six shots Shayna Hubers, left, is accused of murdering her boyfriend, 29-year-old attorney Ryan Poston, right, in what she says was self defense . Crime scene: Police say Hubers gunned down Poston inside his Highland Heights, Ohio, condominium . Her boyfriend of one year Ryan . Poston, 29, a local attorney, was found dead at the scene with his . family claiming the victim had an on and off relationship with Hubers . that he was most recently trying to end. On . October 12, she called police to the scene 15 minutes after shooting . him according to Detective Birkenhauer who said she told him that they had been arguing when . Poston became verbally abusive toward her. Birkenhauer said Hubers shot him from across his kitchen table not once, but six . times, with at least three guns found residing in the condominium. One of those guns, hanging on Poston's bed, was loaded. It . was in that room Birkenhauer said Poston retreated, locking him inside . before Hubers told police she used a key to open the door. 'I’m . quite concerned about the safety of the community,' Judge Karen Thomas . said of her decision to revoke Hubers' bond that had been increased to $5million. 'She has no ties to this community. Seated . in the front of the courtroom were Hubers' parents, Sharon and Robert . Hubers from Kentucky, who were described by her attorney to be ready to . do anything to get their daughter out. Troubled: Poston's family described his relationship with Hubers, left, as tumultuous and said that the 29-year-old was trying to end it . Gristly: Hubers allegedly told police she shot her boyfriend in the face and then fired again to put him out of his misery . As new details emerge many are still quite foggy, however, at least according to Birkenhauer. The whereabouts of the gun used in the crime for instance, a .38-caliber handgun, is so far uncertain. 'She . made numerous statements,' Birkenhauer said. 'She said the gun was in . his hand at one time. She said the gun was in the cabinet.' Bold claim: Hubers' attorney said that the 21-year-old was never prone to violence and shot Poston in self-defense . She also said the gun used was at one time on the kitchen table, 'although that story changed quite a few times,' he said. Hubers was found unharmed at the scene and admitted to police of having torn her boyfriend's shirt during their argument. Hubers stopped police while they were . questioning her to tell them that she shot her boyfriend in the face . and then fired again to put him out of his misery, according to the . report. 'I’m . not going to talk about the facts of the case, except to say that it is . a self-defense case. The only thing she did wrong was having bad taste . in men,' said defense attorney Wil Zevely. '...She is a very young and . kind person. She would never do anything violent: never has, never . would.' The attorney said . his client and Poston had dated for at least a year. The victim’s family . and friends described the relationship as 'tumultuous' and . 'on-and-off. 'Please keep in mind that the real victim in this tragedy is Ryan Poston, not the woman who shot him multiple times,' his family said in a statement cited by WKRC. 'Anyone who ever knew Ryan knows her claims of self-defense are absurd. We look forward to the day when the truth comes out in a court of law, not from the mouth of a criminal defense lawyer trying his case in the media.' Hubers previously appearing in court on October 16 via video from the Campbell County jail. No plea was entered, but a visiting judge reduced her bond from $2million cash to $1million cash or $2million property. Later that day, however, Hubers’ bond amount was increased to $5million by the regular judge. Poston graduated from Salmon P. Chase College of Law, Northern Kentucky University in 2008, following in the footsteps of his grandfather and uncle. In May, he started his own law practice specializing in personal injury cases in downtown Cincinnati, Ohio. High achievers: Hubers, left, took AP classes in high school and made the Dean's List in 2010, while Poston, right, opened his own law practice specializing in personal injury after getting his law degree in 2008 . 'He had a strong feeling of wanting to . help people who wouldn't otherwise have access to the legal system and . who might be steamrolled by the legal system without someone there to . help them,' said attorney Kenneth G. Hawley, who worked across the hall . from Poston. His family and friends have described . him as a bright and hard-working young lawyer who had a promising . future ahead of him. He is survived by his parents and three sisters. One . of his friends, Matthew Herren, told the Kentucky Enquirer that he . wouldn't have been surprised if Poston had run for Congress at a young . age. Hubers graduated from Lexington’s Paul Laurence Dunbar High School in 2009. In the fall of 2010, she made the Dean’s List at the University of Kentucky as a sophomore psychology major. Zevely said she is close with her parents, and her mother spent the day with her in Northern Kentucky prior to the shooting. A friend talking to the station WKYT described Hubers as a quiet and sweet girl who was smarter than most of her classmates.","Detective: Shayna Hubers 'said she gave him the nose job he wanted'

Apple's Asian suppliers have reportedly started mass production of a new tablet computer smaller than the iPad, raising expectations that the tech giant is set to unveil it's iPad mini within weeks. South Korean firm LG Display and AU Optronics of Taiwan began mass production of the smaller LCD screens for the new gadget last month, executives at the component makers said. The report by The Wall Street Journal comes as rumours intensified that Apple was preparing to launch its new tablet within weeks to fend of competition from rivals. Leaked? This image purports to show a black anodised unibody shell for Apple's forthcoming iPad Mini . Different colour schemes: This white front plate component suggests that consumers will have a choice of colours to choose from when they buy their new version of the iPad . The leak comes as two new images purporting to show case components for the new, smaller iPad were published by a Ukrainian iPhone fansite. The images show a previously seen black anodised version of the gadget's unibody shell, as well as a white front panel, suggesting the iPad mini will come in similar colour schemes as the iPhone 5. The positioning of the ports on the leaked images correlates with previous leaks and rumours about the hotly anticipated device. The Wall Street Journal cited unnamed 'executives at component makers' which claimed mass production had begun of 'a new tablet computer smaller than the current iPad'. Two sources said the new tablet will have a 7.85in liquid-crystal display with a lower resolution than the latest full-size iPad, which was released in March. Apple is expected to introduce the iPad mini on October 17th - just a week before arch rival Amazon launches its Fire range of tablets in the UK. Almost ready for prime time? Website Apple.Pro revealed these images of the alleged eight-inch iPad Mini, due to launch on October 17 . The announcement will see Apple go . head to head with Amazon, Google and Barnes & Noble, which last week . announced its own Nook tablets. The iPad Mini, a shrunken version . of Apple's market-changing tablet, is expected to be available in shops on November 2. The Mini launch comes as research suggests a quarter of us - 22 per . cent - own a tablet, with another three per cent regularly borrowing . someone else's tablet for web browsing. About 68 per cent of the 9,5123 adults surveyed said they purchased their tablet within the last year. The U.S. survey by the Pew Research Center also suggests the flood of . cheaper tablets, such as the Google Nexus or Amazon Fire, are weakening . Apple's grip on the market. A year ago, Apple had more than 80 per cent of the market, but this has now dropped to less around 52 per cent. The Kindle Fire has 21 per cent of the market, meanwhile Samsung's Galaxy tablet has eight per cent. Out of those surveyed, 44 per cent of adults who said they have a . smartphone, 46 per cent have an Android phone, 38 per cent, have an . iPhone and 10 per cent have a Blackberry. The launch date was reported by Fortune magazine, which cites Apple investors hearing the date from 'multiple sources'. The . device is believed to have similar hardware to last year's iPad 2, but . reduced to a pocket-friendly seven or eight-inch form. Fortune reports that Apple will send . out invites for the launch on October 10, gathering tech journalists and . stakeholders together to unveil the device. If Apple follows previous form, the event will be held in San Francisco, with a simultaneous launch on London. Images purporting to show the iPad . Mini suggest a device measuring 7.85inches, with an aluminium back-cover . similar to the most recent iPad. It is likely to sport a rear-facing . camera and come with Apple's newest 'lightning' connector, a . controversial re-design which made previous accessories and chargers . obsolete without an adapter. If Apple follows its usual design . styles, it is likely to come in white and black versions, with a choice . of WiFi only, or a 3G option. However this unconfirmed. The device, while still likely to garner a premium price-tag, will help Apple compete with the burgeoning smaller tablet market. The 7-inch Google Nexus tablet sells for £159 for the cheapest version, while Amazon is also producing a budget tablet range. Steve Jobs was . unconvinced that a smaller tablet would be a success, seeing it as a . poor compromise between a tablet and a phone. However Apple appears to have had a change of heart, particularly now that the tablet market has now matured. One issue Apple might face by launching a Mini is a fragmentation in its core product lines. Until the release of the iPhone 5, . Apple's two product lines had kept the same screen resolution, meaning . apps did not need redesigning for different devices, a problem that plagues the competing Android platform. But with the increased screen size of . the iPhone 5, some apps now have a black border, at least until the . developers update their apps, and this problem may now afflict Apple's . tablets, depending on the final size of the Mini. Front and back: Alleged sightings of the iPad Mini suggest it retains the simple, minimalist style of previous models . According to these images, the iPad Mini comes with dual speakers on the rim, as well as the newly-designed dock connector . However this is unlikely to cause . much of a worry to either developers or customers, as most apps will be . updated quickly and developers still only have a small number of devices . to consider, unlike Android which has hundreds of combinations of . models, screen sizes and software versions. Apple does not speak publicly on . future devices, so the launch will not be confirmed until a minimalist . white envelope arrives to the media, inviting them to meet the newest . member of the Apple family.

Few titles can break free from their console shackles and transcend their gaming origins. But where Skylanders succeeds is with its ability to smoothly integrate the virtual world with the physical - creating a relationship never before seen in video games. Buzz off: Swarm is one of the Giants, but is almost too powerful for many foes . For those new to the Skylanders games, it's a simple yet ingenious mechanism where Skylanders toys are placed on a 'Portal Of Power' connected to your console. This then brings them to life in-game. There are loads of different characters, each one attuned to a different elemental power. They . range from Earth, Life, Magic, Undead, Fire and Tech. Thankfully in . Skylanders Giants, all of your characters from the previous game can be . used, too. Gameplay involves running around levels collecting points to level-up your character in the same way as you would in an RPG. Each character has different abilities, and some areas of the level are only accessible to creatures from specific worlds. Although a clear marketing ploy to encourage buying more Skylanders toys, the models are so wonderfully detailed and packed with character, that it is money well spent. Some enemies, too, are dealt with better by certain Skylanders, adding as a further incentive to build a Skylanders army. Colourful: Skylanders may not be a graphical showcase, but it is artistically sound . Each model contains the saved data from your game, so it’s possible to use your ‘levelled-up’ Skylanders on different consoles. Given the high levels of creativity manifested in most of the Skylanders' designs, it's a shame that their dialogue is slightly mundane. There's an attempt at humour, and although likely amusing for the younger generation, it lacks the creativity to impress an older audience. Thankfully, what it lacks in fantastic scripting it makes up for with its cleverly-designed environments. Although not particularly strong aesthetically (especially on the Wii) each level has lots of areas to explore, caves to search and hidden passages. They are designed in a way to encourage playing with different Skylanders, too, which adds a tactical element to proceedings. Unfortunately, the skill goes out the window when controlling the Giants.Although Tree Rex, for example, is great fun to control, there's little depth to the Giants' gameplay. Bright: The game offers many varieties of enemy - each with their own weakness . You're often reduced to hammering buttons to unleash the same combo over and over again. They're often so powerful that hordes of enemies are vanquished in a matter of seconds, which can take away from the already modest challenge. Thankfully, the new competitive two-player mode is a welcome addition - even though it does feel a bit tacked-on. Here, you can pit your Skylanders against each other in Pokemon-esque battles. Indeed, like the aforementioned, this is a game that is phenomenally successful with younger gamers, and has amassed a growing adult following, too. And on this evidence, it’s not hard to see why.

Radical plan: Business Secretary Vince Cable aims to break the stranglehold of the four big lenders with a state-backed business bank . A state-backed small business bank will be handed £1billion of taxpayers’ money to break the stranglehold of the big four lenders, Vince Cable will say today. The Business Secretary will unveil details of Treasury plans to sponsor a new bank which is to offer credit through smaller providers such as Handelsbanken, the Co-Op and the Aldermore. Mr Cable has scored a significant victory over Chancellor George Osborne in securing new public money for the institution. The Treasury had initially intended simply to put existing Government lending initiatives under one roof and call it a business bank. Both Mr Cable’s business department and the Treasury will contribute to the £1billion public money put into the project, potentially meaning more spending cuts. The private sector is expected to contribute at least as much again, allowing the bank to underwrite around £10billion of lending to small businesses. However, despite the urgency of the squeeze on firms, the new bank is not expected to be up and running for 12 to 18 months. Mr Cable admits many firms still face serious problems in raising finance, with 33 per cent which applied for a loan in the last year being turned down. The creation of the state-backed business bank is a tacit admission that Project Merlin, the Government’s attempt to set tough new lending targets for the big four banks – Lloyds TSB, Barclays, RBS and HSBC – has done little to help. Business groups have been calling for a single institution, backed by the state, to address the gaps in the supply of finance for several years. The proposal is inspired by similar models in Germany, the U.S. and Ireland. The Business Secretary will say: ‘For decades British industry has lacked the sort of diverse, long-term finance that is normal elsewhere. We need a British business bank with a clean balance sheet and a mandate to expand lending rapidly and we are now going to get it. ‘Alongside the private sector, the bank will get the market lending to manufacturers, exporters and growth companies that so desperately need support. It will be a lasting monument to our determination to reshape finance so it can finally serve industry the way it should. ‘Its success will not be the scale of its own direct interventions but how far it shakes up the market in business finance and helps to ease constraints for high-growth firms.’ Not lending: The creation of the state-backed business bank is a tacit admission that Project Merlin, the Government¿s attempt to set tough new lending targets for the big four banks ¿ Lloyds TSB, Barclays, RBS and HSBC ¿ has done little to help . Mr Cable will tell the Liberal Democrat conference that the bank will support up to £10billion of finance to small and medium businesses – a significant portion of all the lending available. The bank, he will say, will operate at arm’s length from Government and be commercially focused. John Longworth, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce, said: ‘We are pleased that ministers are heeding our call to create a business bank that goes well beyond a re-badging of existing schemes. ‘The funding announced by Vince Cable is the first step in a journey toward a British Business Bank that enables new and growing companies to get access to capital in the same way that they do in Germany, South Korea, and the USA.’ John Walker, national chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses, said: ‘The small business bank is a good thing – we’ve been calling for this for a long time and we are delighted to see it finally get off the ground. ‘We are certain it will help boost confidence and deliver growth.’ Business lobby: John Walker, national chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses, left, and John Longworth, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce, right, both back the move . The Daily Mail has highlighted the plight of struggling small firms with its ‘Make the Banks Lend’ campaign for several years. The small business loan market currently has around £50billion of outstanding loans, and the typical amount of capital set aside by a large high street bank for supporting this area of the economy is at most a few billion pounds. Mr Cable warned Tory colleagues last night that regional public sector pay – an idea being examined by Chancellor George Osborne – was ‘completely unacceptable’ and ‘terrible economics’. He said, however, that the Lib Dems were prepared to contemplate a degree of flexibility in different parts of the country to aid recruitment.","New bank will underwrite around £10billion of lending to small businesses .

The victim of a brutal castration and his lover who allegedly murdered him were openly affectionate and in love, a close friend told the court today. Portuguese underwear model Renato Seabra, 21, is accused of murdering fashion journalist Carlos Castro, 65, while they were on vacation at the InterContinental Hotel in Manhattan last year. Wanda Pires, a close friend of Castro, said her friend described the relationship as 'the best thing that ever happened in his life'. 'So in love': A friend of Carlos Castro (right) said he had lavished his younger lover Renato Seabra (left) with gifts before the younger man allegedly castrated him in a New York hotel room . Ms Pires said Mr Castro had given the aspiring model free rein with his credit card and had planned trips to shopping malls, casinos and basketball games during their vacation, according to the New York Post. The ambitious younger man was also hoping to find modelling work through a Manhattan agency. Ms Pires added that the couple, who had been together since October 2010, were so in love they would even feed each other over meals. She added: 'Every time they went to eat they were sharing food with each other… very friendly, very happy.' However according to Pires' testimony, Seabra taunted Castro by trying to get the phone numbers of young women on the day before the murder. The relationship between the two soured when Castro later caught Seabra going out with a group of young women. On January 7, 2011, tensions came to a head when Seabra and Castro got into a . fight over the older man's plans to send his lover home, thus signalling . the end of their whirlwind romance. Ms Pires told jurors that she spoke to Castro on the morning he died and he said the couple had fought all night and Seabra had declared he was no longer gay. Aspiring model: The defense claims that Seabra, 21, had a psychotic break when he murdered his older lover while on vacation in New York . Murder trial: Defense lawyers for Seabra have claimed that he suffered a psychotic break whereas the prosecution said that he strangled and mutilated Castro out of rage . The prosecution hope to debunk the defense's claim that Seabra fell into an hour-long psychotic . fit when he bludgeoned Castro with a TV, strangled him and then cut off . his testicles with a corkscrew while he was still alive. District Attorney Maxine Rosenthal earlier . described Seabra as a hot-headed, gold-digger who realized that his free . ride was over and killed Castro out of anger, not insanity. Defense attorney Rubin Sinins told jurors last week during opening testimony that Seabra had a psychotic fit when he cut off his lover's testicles and slit his own wrists. 'He put one [testicle] on each wrist,' Sinins told the court. 'He did this for his protection. He could also . harness the power. 'He wandered the streets of Manhattan, touching . people, because he had the power to cure people from AIDS, because he . had the power to cure them.' Luxury: Castro and Seabra had a huge fight while staying at the high-end InterContinental Hotel in Manhattan which ended in Castro's brutal death . The lawyer went on, telling the jury . that Seabra explained to police the day after the murder that ‘he . believed Mr. Castro's testicles were demons, and that by pulling them . out everything would be right with the world'. The lawyer asked the jury to acquit . Seabra by reason of insanity, with the possibility of being committed to . a psychiatric facility. ‘He was in another world,’ Sinins told . jurors. ‘He was deluded into thinking that he was a special messenger . from God, on a mission to make the world a better place.’ However, . the prosecution implored the panel not to believe the psychotic episode . story, insisting that there was nothing in the 21-year-old’ medical . history to suggest even mild mental illness. Court papers presented by prosecutors . described a statement police said Seabra gave after the January 7 death . of Mr Castro while the two were on holiday in Manhattan. The account depicted an argument in a . hotel room that turned vicious and escalated into a prolonged hour-long . frenzy, with Seabra first choking his companion, then stabbing him with a . corkscrew in his face and groin. Seabra . also admitted to hitting Mr Castro on the head with a monitor . and stamping on his face while wearing shoes, the papers said. After the attack Seabra told police, he showered, put on a suit and left. The 21-year-old, Seabra, was a . contestant in 2010 on a Portuguese television show called A Procura Do . Sonho, or 'Pursuit Of A Dream', which hunts for modelling talent. Although . he did not win the show, he gained a modelling contract with an agency . founded by designer Fatima Lopes, who developed the show and was a . judge.

A trainee lawyer has racked up £350,000 in legal bills pursuing damages after being injured by a sun lounger on a luxury cruise ship. Now Shantelle Taylor, 22, is pleading with senior judges to save her from financial ruin after her eight-year battle with P&O. She was aged 14 during the £20,000 Caribbean cruise on the liner Aurora when she claimed a sun lounger was caught by a gust of wind and flew into her. Happier memories: Shantelle Taylor and her mother Nichola aboard the P&O cruise ship Aurora at Christmas 2003 - days before she was allegedly hit by a sun lounger . Miss Taylor sued the company after returning home from the trip with her grandparents and mother Nichola, 40. At first it was thought she had . escaped with only a soft tissue injury but her family claims that her . life has been blighted since by crippling chronic pain syndrome. Earlier in the court saga that has lasted since 2004, P&O admitted liability and offered her £2,000 to settle the claim. Miss Taylor, of Droylesden, Manchester, turned this down and went on to seek substantial damages. Her fortunes reversed in 2008 when a . judge allowed P&O to withdraw its admission after fresh evidence . about weather conditions on the day of the accident. The judge ruled that her damages claim had ‘no reasonable prospect of success’ after the testimony of a wind speed expert. Miss Taylor has run out of funds to . pay lawyers but fought on with the help of her grandfather Derek Wilde, . 74, and his wife Christine, 65. The cruise liner Aurora pictured in Southampton: The alleged incident occurred when the wind lifted an on-board sun lounger . Despite having no legal training, Mr Wilde appeared at the Appeal Court in London to plead her case. He asked Mr Justice Peter Smith to resurrect Miss Taylor’s claim and spare her the mammoth costs bill. The judge warned Mr Wilde: ‘If you . lose this case, they’ll probably make your granddaughter bankrupt. You . are out of your depth.’ Mr Wilde continued, telling him: ‘It . is important we win for Shantelle because she is studying to become a . solicitor and we don’t want her to have a black mark against her.’ He asked the judge to send his . granddaughter’s damages claim back for re-hearing and to look again at . the huge bill for legal costs. Mr Wilde pleaded: ‘It is so unfair when it is not her fault.’ He told how the family set off on . their dream holiday for three weeks over Christmas 2003 and New Year . 2004, taking in 18 countries. The accident with the . sun lounger happened on the 12th or 13th deck of the liner as it lay off . the coast of Tortola in the British Virgin Islands in early 2004, said . Mr Wilde. The judge ruled that Miss Taylor’s damages claim could not be . revived but he did grant an adjournment. He said this would allow Mr Wilde to seek legal advice and obtain documents relating to the costs, £7,500 of which falls on him. The judge said: ‘It is  important that Mr Wilde has a fair chance to prove his case on behalf of his granddaughter.’ Outside court, Mrs Wilde said the cruise should have been ‘the holiday of a lifetime’. She said her granddaughter had been . left in ‘excruciating pain’ but added: ‘She is studying to be a . solicitor and she’s doing very well.’ A P&O Cruises spokesman said: 'Mr Wilde, on behalf of his granddaughter, has pursued this spurious case over many years despite warnings that he would be liable for his costs when he lost. 'The Court of Appeal decided that the evidence showed that the accident could not possibly have occurred in any of the various ways alleged.  The Court therefore refused Mr Wilde permission to continue with the case to trial. 'P&O Cruises has incurred over £200,000 in lawyers costs defending this claim, which the Court found Mr Wilde and Shantelle Taylor were liable to pay.  P&O Cruises can confirm it has not threatened to make Miss Taylor bankrupt.'","Trainee lawyer Shantelle Taylor was 14 when she was injured on P&O ferry .

A father who was run over by his own car after it took off with him beneath it to the witness of his three young boys is hospitalized in critical condition this week. Paul Pattison had climbed beneath his Jeep trying to jump start it on a Summerville, South Carolina road when it took off on Sunday afternoon while carrying his children, the oldest aged 11. 'He had to get up underneath it and start it with a screwdriver by touching the solenoid's together and just that split second he didn't put it back in park from drive,' James Libby, his friend of 25 years told WCSC. Scroll down for video . Horrific accident: Paul Pattison, a father of three young boys, had climbed beneath his Jeep trying to jump start it when it took off running over his chest and head . It was a move Mr Libby said his friend had done dozens of times before, but this time, most likely rushed because of traffic, he forgot to put it in park. Taking off, the vehicle rolled directly over the father and into a roadside ditch. The wheels stopped spinning only after his oldest son, aged 11, hopped into the front seat and shifted it into park. 'Unfortunately, the vehicle ran over his chest and head area. He has some brain trauma,' said Mr Libby. Tragic mistake: A family friend said that Mr Pattison forgot to put his vehicle in park after it stalled on this road and before he climbed beneath it to get it going again . The coincidence of an off-duty EMS worker driving behind Mr Pattison along with his airlift to a nearby hospital are what Mr Libby credits for saving his friend's life. But visiting him in hospital after his surgery on Monday and seeing the extent of his injuries he said left him not only 'mortified,' but 'terrified for him and for his kids.' 'He was hooked up to a lot of machinery, he was obviously hurting,' said Mr Libby. 'I'd like to think that he knew I was there. They had him doped up pretty good on medication so he wasn't talking.' Son's quick thinking: Pictured with two of his three young boys, it was his oldest son, aged 11, who jumped in the passenger seat and put the car in park as its wheels spun in a ditch . It was a state trooper and Mr Pattison's young children that told him everything that had happened. 'It's just terrible what's happened to him and his family over this. They really need the help and prayers of all the people around here to help Paul get through this,' he said. Further helping the father and his family in their time of need, Mr Libby has set up a trust fund for Mr Pattison’s wife at their local Suntrust bank. The boys' school is also holding a fundraiser.

Britain’s fattest teenager will be kept in hospital for at least six months as she tries to shed enough weight to have a gastric band fitted - though her friends have joked she hopes to be out in time to have Christmas dinner. Georgia Davis, 19, who was 63 stone at her heaviest, is being treated for obesity related health problems at Prince Charles Hospital in Merthyr Tydfil, Wales. Friends yesterday revealed how Georgia, 19, is sticking to her strict hospital food diet and is pledging to get back to health - although she will spend the rest of the year in hospital. One friend said: “She has been told she will have three months in hospital before being taken to a special obesity hospital where she could have surgery. Diet: Miss Davis, 19, has shed three stone due to a strict calorie-controlled programme . “She is very unhappy but knows things have to change if she is going to have any sort of life. “Georgia . said she is hoping to be out for Christmas. Knowing her that is all . about Christmas lunch - it is one of her favourites.” Georgia had to be cut out of her house in Aberdare, South Wales, to be rushed to hospital for emergency treatment last week. She is due to stay for three months before going to a special obesity clinic 40 miles away at Morriston Hospital in Swansea. Meanwhile, . it has emerged that Georgia would order up to eight kebabs at a time . from a nearby takeaway where she would run up a bill of £5,000 each . year. The teenager used . to buy up to 20 kebabs a week - each one containing 2,000 calories - . from the fast food restaurant near her home in Aberdare, Wales. The teenager would also order two large 1.5 litre bottles of Coke to wash down her food feasts, a delivery driver revealed. Builders had to demolish the wall of her home so she could be rushed to hospital when she was unable to stand up. The teenager has now lost three stone in a week now after being put on a strictly-controlled diet by medics. She weighs 52 stone and not the 63 stone which doctors had originally estimated. Albert . Altia, a delivery driver who works for the local Marmaris kebab house, . said the teenager's usual order was nine large kebabs - seven for . herself and one each for her parents. The driver said: 'That is a ridiculous amount of food for one person. I would not eat seven kebabs in a month.' Mr Altian thought there was a party at the house the first time he made a delivery. 'I once delivered 10 kebabs there. I think that was one for the mother, one for the father and the rest for her,' he said. Each large kebab costs £4.90. Deliveries: She would order junk food from Tesco and Asda and sneak it past her parents . Her parents revealed she ordered junk food online and would sneak the deliveries past them at their home in Aberdare, Wales. Mother . Lesley Davis and stepfather Arthur Treloar revealed that they tried to . help the teen - who was believed to weigh up to 63 stone - eat . healthily, but they discovered her buying cakes, fizzy drinks and . takeaways online. Miss Davis's mother Lesley, 57, told The Sun: . 'Arthur and I would be watching TV in the lounge and Georgia would make . her way downstairs, casually saying, ""It's hot in my bedroom. I'm just . going outside for some fresh air."" 'We now know that she was meeting the delivery van and secretly carrying the food upstairs to her bedroom. 'She had been eating all sorts of naughty things like sausage rolls, pasties and cakes - and drinking lots of Coke.' Miss Davis and mother Lesley, who says she and Georgia's stepfather Arthur tried to keep her weight under control . Schoolfriend Leah Price, 20, said: 'I remember seeing Iceland and Tesco vans pulling up at least once or twice a week and I saw takeaway pizza's and kebabs all the time. 'My friend has been eating herself to death and no one was helping her. If they had helped her sooner it wouldn't have come to this - it's a tragedy.' Georgia is currently hooked up to an oxygen tank on a specially-designed £4,000 bed while doctors at Prince Charles Hospital in Merthyr Tydfil carry out tests. She is suffering from complications including diabetes and kidney failure, as well as problems with her spine, joints and skin. She vowed to lose weight and get her life back on track, saying: ""I'm sick of being like this - I'm getting my life back."" She has been given a special gown to wear after admitting she had outgrown all her own clothes and was forced to use a bedsheet to cover her modesty. Scaffolding: The upstairs front wall of Miss Davis's home had to be demolished to free the teenager . Major operation: It took 50 people to rescue Miss Davis from her home after she fell ill . The public response to her dramatic hospitalisation hasn't been all positive. Last week she was forced to delete her Facebook page after she was targeted by cyberbullies who were taunting her online. As . well as having her personal account abused the teenager also had to . contend with one troll creating a new Facebook page called RIP Georgia . Davis - which has since been taken down. The page said: 'You are just a . big lazy girl who loves cake - you are a fat waste of space and I hope . you die soon. 'You fat blob, you are adding . millions of pounds to the tax payers bill. If I had my way I would wipe . that fat grin off your face by making you pay us back.' Another anonymous commenter said: 'Why don’t you just stop eating so much you fat fool. 'You are just a big lazy girl who loves cake - you are a fat waste of space and I hope you die soon.' It was reported to the site by her friends and has now been removed. Friends: Jade Tarrant (left) lived with Georgia Davis (right), but Miss Davis put on weight again after moving back in with her parents . The teen's best friend Jade Tarrant also . revealed how Miss Davis lost weight after moving in with her, but . returned home to care for her sick father after he was diagnosed with . lung cancer - and the weight piled back on. Miss Tarrant said: 'I always knew it was going to get this bad if she went home again. 'She would have lost weight if she stayed with me because I like my salads and I could have got her on it. 'But she missed her mum and step-dad. She ended up going back and putting her own health at risk.' Georgia eventually stopped venturing outside altogether and, by the time a 50-man emergency team cut her free, she had not left the house for about eight months.

A company founded by Conservative Party chairman Grant Shapps is to be investigated by the advertising standards watchdog after the politician posed as a multi-millionaire under a false name to sell its services. The firm, set up by Mr Shapps before he became an MP but when he was standing as a candidate for the Tories at a general election, is alleged to have used the alias of ‘Michael Green’ as its front man. Mr Shapps attended conferences bearing the name tag Michael Green. The Advertising Standards Authority has now launched an investigation into HowToCorp.com over allegations that the public had been misled by the alleged use of an alias. Mr Shapps - who was recently promoted to the Cabinet in a reshuffle - has always maintained that he used a different name to keep his business and political interests separate. He is expected to open the Conservatives’ conference in Birmingham this weekend. The business has come under scrutiny since pictures emerged of Shapps attending a $3,000-a-head conference in a Las Vegas hotel showing him wearing a nametag with the name 'Michael Green'. Mr Shapps passed the company on to his wife Belinda in 2008 and has not had any involvement with it since. The firm also used the name of a businessman Sebastian Fox to promote its services.

A traumatised father-of-two who lost his four-month-old son as he escaped the Dark Knight Rises shooting proposed to his girlfriend, and mother of his children, on Friday, just hours after the young family were reunited. Prompted by the horror the pair had just encountered and the prospect of losing his loved ones, Jamie Rohrs asked Patricia Legarreta to marry him, as she was being treated for a minor bullet wound at the hospital. 'He just looked at me and he said, 'I know this is not the time and place, but will you marry me?' And I said, 'Yes,'' Ms Legarreta told CNN host Piers Morgan. Rare smiles: Jamie Rohrs, left, proposed to Patricia Legarreta, right, at the hospital just hours after they lost each other in the chaotic theatre . 'Going through 10 minutes of thinking he was dead and I would never see him again, you never want that feeling again,' she added. But speaking to ABC's 'Good Morning America' this morning, the young mother admitted the happy occasion was tinged with heartbreak. 'I'm ecstatic, extremely excited, but at the same time, you have this tragedy, this sadness hanging over,' she told the TV station. The couple had taken their infant son Ethan and four-year-old daughter to the midnight screening in Aurora, Colorado, thinking the children would sleep through the movie as they sat on the second floor balcony. But when suspected gunman James Holmes, 24, opened fire on the packed movie theater, Mr Rohrs and Ms Legarreta were separated. Horrified: Jamie Rohr, pictured left with fiancee Patricia Legarreta, described his trauma after losing the couple's four-month-old son during the massacre . Ms Legarreta told 'Good Morning America' that she credits Jarell Brooks, 19, with helping her and her two children get out of the theatre alive. 'I don't know where I would be,' Ms Legarreta said. 'I don't remember exactly everything that happened but I thank him because having him there next to me, knowing that there was somebody there, just, it's comforting, knowing that somebody was willing to help.' Mr Brooks said he was sitting six rows from the back when Holmes, appeared in front of the movie screen and started shooting. 'The only reason I saw him was from the flashes of the gunshots,' he said. 'My life definitely flashed before my eyes in that moment.' While trying to get out of the theatre, the teen saw Ms Legarreta, struggling to get herself and her two children out. Hero: Ms Legarreta, left, has credited Jarell Brooks, 19, right, with helping her and her two children get out of the theatre alive . He said he crawled on top of the woman in an attempt to push her and the kids out the door and was shot in the thigh while protecting them. 'It felt like a sharp pain,' he told 'Good Morning America'. 'When I tried to move my left leg, I went down. I looked at my hand and I noticed there was bleeding. That's when I knew it was real.' But Mr Brooks said he doesn't consider himself a hero for helping Ms Legarreta escape the spray of bullets. 'I saw someone in distress,' he said. 'I'm not the kind of person who would let them be in that situation and me selfishly trying to get myself out of the equation... all she's trying to do is protect her kids, so I felt like if I could get her out, then maybe, I would have gotten out maybe I wouldn't, as long as I knew she was OK I was alright.' Before the mother-of-two encountered Mr Brooks, she said her daughter had fallen over because she was disorientated after falling asleep during the movie. She said she attempted to shield the little girl from the gunfire. Holding back tears: Patricia Legarreta, left, and Jamie Rohrs hold their infant son Ethan after recovering him from the movie theatre floor . 'Just blocking her, just shoving her, . just making sure she's not getting hurt, just trying to keep her down,' she said. 'Just trying to keep calm so she didn't start freaking out . even more. It was just so scary.' Ms . Legarreta's fiance, Mr Rohrs, managed to escape the Dark Knight Rises . shooting - but was horrified to realise he had lost his four-month old . son on the floor of the theatre in the chaos. The . infant was rescued by his mother who had a shrapnel wound to her leg . but still managed to drag the child and their four-year-old daughter to . safety. When gunman James Holmes burst in and began shooting Ms Legarreta heard her fiance shout at her to get down on the floor. She was then hit in the leg and fell to the floor herself. Survivors: Jamie Rohrs and Patricia Legarreta with their son Ethan after they escaped the midnight screening . Mr Rohrs jumped over the seat with their baby son and said he considered playing dead. 'I'm trying to keep him low. And he's crying,' he told ABC News . 'People are running all over. I'm tripping and falling. I don't know if I laid him down or sat him down. 'I look up to see if I can run. I'm ducking, dodging, turning left, turning right. ... Every time you hear a gun shot, it's like 'Oh, I'm dead.' 'I'm just disoriented after I put him down,' Mr Rohrs said. 'I'm just waiting for me to hit the ground and fall down dead. You could see the gunfire and people are dropping.' He said he tried to retrieve his son but eventually jumped over the balcony and fled. But Ms Legarreta saw Ethan as she lay on the floor with the wound to her leg that stretched from her upper thigh to waist. Safe and sound: Jamie Rohrs hold his four-month-old son as he describes his ordeal . She pulled the infant to him and ran out the theatre with her daughter and baby boy - only realising she had been hit when she made it outside. Mr Rohrs said he was horrified to realise his fiancee, son and daughter when he made it outside. 'My son's still in there,' he told ABC News. 'My girlfriend is still in there. I'm out here. Who leaves their child there?' The couple then reunited outside the cinema, after Ms Legarreta phoned her fiance who had driven away from the scene. They had recently moved to Aurora from New Mexico and defended their decision to take their children to the late night screening. Mr Rohrs said: 'We have to go out. We have to do things.

Duped 007 fans: Adam Adamou duped businessmen out of £1.4m by promising luxury cars, jewellery and first edition Ian Fleming books . Wealthy James Bond fans were duped out of £1.4m by a conman who promised them limited edition luxury cars, expensive jewellery and first edition Ian Fleming books. Adam Adamou, 39, claimed he could secure luxury cars such as Ferraris, Rolls-Royce Phantoms and Aston Martins, a first edition set of James Bond novels, expensive Rolex watches and a Hawker Beechcraft plane for three businessmen. But after initially providing an Audi R8 and an Aston Martin, Adamou pocketed the rest of the money, leaving the men £850,000 out of pocket. He was caught after a three-year investigation uncovered his fraud. Today, Adamou, from Hoddesdon, Hertfordshire, was jailed for three years and four months after he pleaded guilty to 25 charges of fraud. The con began when the victims, James O’Toole, 34, his brother Martin, 36, and their colleague David Breeze, 47, were approached to join a private concierge club which claimed to assist entrepreneurs invest and make profit by buying and selling luxury goods. The men ran a York-based investment and tax advisory company called Aston Court Chambers International Ltd, named after Bond’s favourite car. They also had an off-shore branch named Universal Exports, the pseudonym used for the British Secret Service MI6 in the James Bond stories. They had meetings with Adamou, who was in charge of sourcing at the club. Watch out: The businessmen placed orders for luxury cars and expensive watches - including ones worn by Daniel Craig in Quantum of Solace (right) and Roger Moore in Moonraker (left) Over time he built up trust with the victims, who placed significant investments with him, ordering expensive cars and watches. They also paid in advance to be on a waiting list for prestige cars which they hoped to sell on for a profit when their place neared the top of the list. Adamou then told them he was setting up his own business and that their payments should be made directly to his account rather than his employer’s. The victims received some goods initially but as time went on, Adamou failed to deliver. Among . the payments was £12,100 for a first edition set of James Bond novels, . which never materialised, while £40,000 was handed over for a . Lamborghini which was only a concept car that had not even gone into . production. Taken for a ride: Adamou pocketed the money victims had given him in return for prestige cars such as Aston Martins, like the one driven by Pierce Brosnan in Die Another Day . The victims paid £12,100 for a first edition set of James Bond novels that never materialised (pictured is file photo of a first edition of Casino Royale) He also convinced the businessmen to hand over nearly £250,000 to restore three E-Type Jaguars. A . fourth businessman is said to have lost £75,000 to Adamou in an alleged . business investment in Wood Green, London, and £46,200 in a car deal. At . Southwark Crown Court Adamou, who has since gone bankrupt, was told he . had benefited to the tune of £918,015 and was ordered to repay the . amount in future earnings. A further nine counts of fraud and one of money-laundering were ordered to remain on file. Judge . Deborah Taylor said: ‘These were high value, premeditated offences of . fraud and dishonesty including a large number of victims. ‘It’s clear that these matters not only . affected the victims personally financially but also had an impact on . their health and business interests.' After the case, Det Sgt Garry Ridler of . North Yorkshire Police said: ‘This man secured the trust of his victims . before playing on their desire to lead an extremely glamorous and . affluent lifestyle. ‘He took the opportunity to exploit extremely wealthy individuals. ‘The . sentence reflects the level of deceit committed by Adamou. He gained . the trust of a number of people and then abused that trust, taking them . for as much money as he could. ‘The . case sends a clear message to all fraudsters that their lies and . duplicity will be uncovered and they will be made to face the . consequences of their actions.’ Must repay: Adamou was told at Southwark Crown Court (pictured) he had to repay £918,015 in future earnings .","Adam Adamou claimed he could source luxury cars, jewellery and James Bond first edition novels .
