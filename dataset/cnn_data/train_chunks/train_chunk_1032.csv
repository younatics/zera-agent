"Mario Balotelli is open to a move to Arsenal after his agent revealed 'anything is possible'  this summer. The Italy striker, who scored the winner against England in the World Cup on Saturday night, features highly on Arsene Wenger's shopping list as the manager looks to sign a prolific striker. Arsenal have made contact with his agent Mino Raiola with regards to arranging a deal for the Milan striker and Raiola didn't deny the interest. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Balotelli look sharp taking free kicks in Italy training . Realistic signing: Arsenal chiefs believe Balotelli is a realistic target with AC Milan lowering their wage bill . Meet and greet: Mario balotelli poses with fans prior to Italy's training session on Tuesday in Rio de Janeiro . Mr Popular: Admirers of the Milan striker pose for selfies with him as he is mobbed during training . All smiles: Balotelli was delighted to meet some of his young fans on the training pitch . 'Arsenal are a fantastic club,' Balotelli's agent Mino Raiola told Sky Sports. 'Will a transfer happen? Anything is possible.' Arsenal want to find out what the cost of the deal would be before fully pursuing a swoop for Balotelli. AC Milan are keen to offload the striker as they look to ease their wage bill this summer. Arsenal have been made aware of Balotelli's availability and are ready to strike if the deal makes financial sense. Winner: Balotelli scored the decisive goal against England in Manaus on Thursday night . Meanwhile, the Gunners will explore the option of a taking a player from Manchester United as the Old Trafford club step up their interest in Thomas Vermaelen. The Gunners are monitoring the futures of United pair Chris Smalling and Tom Cleverley, who could be surplus to requirements at United. And a player-swap deal could persuade the Gunners to part with their captain. I win: Balotelli shows the cameras the score on his fingers, 2-1, with his goal the match-winning moment . London's finest: Fiancee Fanny Neguesha could be joining Super Mario back in England at Arsenal . Arsenal want to sign a new centre-back before letting Vermaelen leave. New United boss Louis van Gaal wants to sign the Belgium international as he looks to put his stamp on the Old Trafford squad. Van Gaal is confident he can lure the central defender away from the Emirates Stadium ahead of next season. United-bound: Vermaelen could be heading for Old Trafford if Arsenal can get Cleverley or Smalling . Unshakeable: Mertesacker and Koscielny's form has seen captain Vermaelen frustrated on the sidelines . Vermaelen grew increasingly frustrated at his role at Arsenal last season as he played second fiddle to first choice central defensive pairing Per Mertesacker and Laurent Koscielny. But Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger is unwilling to let his skipper leave the club without having a replacement lined up. Having already lost right-back Bacary Sagna, who was the club's fourth choice centre-back, to Manchester City, the Gunners boss does not want to leave himself short of cover in the position. Talisman: Balotelli could be the new striker that Arsenal fans have been praying for this summer . Vermaelen has a year left on his current Arsenal contract, meaning he can leave the club for nothing next summer - a scenario the Gunners are keen to avoid. The Gunners are ready to offer Vermaelen a new contract this summer, but without the guarantee of increased first-team opportunities next season, the Belgian is likely to be reluctant to sign. Cardiff defender Steven Caulker is being considered by Wenger, while Manchester City right-back Micah Richards, who can also play centre-back, could also be an option.

"Guinness has dropped out of the New York City St Patrick's Day parade to support gay rights, just a day before the 250-year-old event is set to take place. The event's organizers sparked outrage in the LGBT community for banning gay groups from carrying signs identifying their sexuality in the parade, and last month New York Mayor Bill de Blasio announced he wouldn't be attending. The Irish beer company decided to pull sponsorship from the parade after the owners of legendary New York gay bar The Stonewall Inn threatened to stop serving the draught. Scroll down for video . No pints for you: The Irish beer company has pulled its sponsorship of the New York City parade because the event is excluding certain participation of the LGBT community. Above, a waitress pours pints of Guinness during this year's celebrations in London . Rules: The parade's organizers say gays can march in the event, but can't carry signs that advertise their sexuality . Pressured: Guinness announced its decision to drop out of the parade after New York gay bar The Stonewall Inn threatened to stop serving the stout . A Guinness spokesperson said the company was hoping the organizers would reverse their exclusionary policy in time for the Monday parade, but since the rules weren't changed the company decided to withdraw participation. 'Guinness has a strong history of supporting diversity and being an advocate for equality for all...We will continue to work with community leaders to ensure that future parades have an inclusionary policy' the statement read. Following the statement, The Stonewall Inn said it would continue to serve Guinness. Guinness is the third beer company to drop sponsorship of an American St Patrick's Day Parade this year in support of gay rights. On Friday, both Sam Adams and Heineken pulled out of parades citing the exclusionary policies. Count us out: On Friday, Sam Adams dropped out of the Boston St Patrick's Day parade, and Heineken ended its sponsorship of the New York event . Sam Adams was a sponsor of the parade in Boston, which happened on Sunday, but ended financial support when a local gay bar threatened to stop serving their beer. 'We were hopeful that both sides of this issue would be able to come to an agreement that would allow everyone, regardless of orientation, to participate in the parade,' Jessica Paar, a spokeswoman for Boston Beer Company, which brews Sam Adams, said in a statement.'But given the current status of the negotiations, we realize this may not be possible.' Dutch-brewer Heineken ended its support of the New York City parade saying they 'believe in equality for all' and therefore couldn't sponsor the event. The decision by a big-name Irish brewery to end its sponsorship of the parade has been applauded by gay-rights group GLAAD. Same old story: The anti-gay parade policy has been in place for years. Above, gay rights activists protest the NYPD's involvement with the parade in 2011 . 'Today, Guinness sent a strong message to its customers and employees: discrimination should never be celebrated,' Sarah Kate Ellis, GLAAD's CEP and President, said in a statement. 'As a gay mom who has fond memories of the New York City St. Patrick's Day Parade, it saddens me that I can't give those same memories to my own kids because my family isn't welcome. Hopefully, as parade organizers realize that anti-LGBT discrimination is not supported by sponsors, or many Irish New Yorkers, they'll see that families like mine should be part of the celebration.' Currently Ford is the last major American company to continue its sponsorship of the parade. In a statement issued to CNBC last week, the motor company said it sponsors a 'wide range of events' across teh country and that no one event 'reflects Ford's views on every issue.' 'Ford is proud of its inclusive policies. Every member of the Ford team is valued, and we provide employee benefits regardless of race, gender or sexual orientation,' the statement read. Instead of attending the main New York City parade, Mayor De Blasio marched the Queens borough St Patrick's Day parade earlier this month - an event which allows full LGBT participation. Not going to make it: Mayor Bill de Blasio announced last month he would not be attending the New York parade. Instead, he marched in the Queens St Patrick's Day parade earlier this month which has been accepting of the LGBT community . De Blasio will be the first mayor for over 20 years not to march in the famous Irish parade down Fifth Avenue on March 17. Openly gay public officials in the city have also said they will miss the event. City Councilman Jimmy Van Bramer, who was arrested at the parade with a gay-pride banner in 2000, said de Blasio had taken a 'strong stand against discrimination'. 'I find it offensive that the parade takes a formal and hard line that I can’t participate,' Van Bramer said. 'That literally shuts out huge portions of our city.' Others disagreed. President of the Catholic League Bill Donohue lambasted the mayor's announcement. 'Personally, I am delighted,' Donohue said in a statement posted on the Catholic League’s website. 'I do not want to march with a public official who does not want to be associated with Irish Catholics,' he added. It was back in 1993 that a New York mayor chose not to march in the parade. David Dinkins declined to take part because of similar reasons. Former mayor Michael Bloomberg marched every year. New York City St. Patrick's Day Parade is one of the U.S.'s oldest Irish traditions. It marched for the first time more than 250 years ago, on March 17, 1762 - 14 years before the Declaration of Independence. Attendee: Former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, an Irish American, marched in the parade every year he was in office .","The parade's organizers have banned LGBT marchers from holding up signs advertising their sexuality .

"New Zealand scrum-half Aaron Smith believes the pain of succumbing to his only defeat in an All Blacks shirt against England will fuel his performance in tomorrow's first Test at Eden Park. Smith and his fellow world champions were thrashed 38-21 at Twickenham in December 2012 - a record defeat against England. The All Blacks avenged that loss with a 30-22 victory in last year's November international but Smith still carries the scars of his solitary reversal for New Zealand from 26 caps.

I still have clear memories of that day. It's quite painful still. 'It's still there to fuel to me - the way it happened. They blew us away in the end. 'I learned from that game, that it's not about trying to win the game early. 'It's a general big-time Test match where you try and win as many moments as you can. 'It was a lot better in the second game and we showed them a lot more respect. 'Everyone thought ""oh God no"" when England went ahead but we had to trust our plan and we got the win which was really good.' Smith is relishing the opportunity to finally play England on home soil having faced them at Twickenham twice, one of which was New Zealand's only loss since winning the World Cup in 2011.

"Luis Suarez admitted his two goals that leave England on the brink of World Cup elimination were sweet revenge for all the criticism he has got playing in the Premier League. The Liverpool and Uruguay striker has been banned for racially abusing Manchester United’s Patrice Evra and for biting Chelsea’s Branislav Ivanovic during a controversial career in England.

"Cristiano Ronaldo has declared himself fit for Portugal’s Group G opener against Germany – and told sceptics who believe he needs a good World Cup to look at his CV. The Real Madrid forward has been struggling with a knee problem in the build up to Monday night's heavyweight clash in Salvador, but said on Sunday: ‘Obviously I would like to be at 110 per cent - I am 100 per cent and that is enough to help the national team. ‘I have been practising for many days and I am feeling well.

The subject of his legacy was again raised on Sunday, with Ronaldo adamant that he has nothing to prove. He said: ‘I don’t think I have to show anyone anything. Look at my statistics and CV – I have no words for that question. I have nothing to prove. My career has been great so far and I just want to continue.’ Ronaldo added: ‘I believe one player is not a team. I am here to help the team. I am an additional player and I can make a difference, but I can’t carry the team on my back.

"A thoroughly deflated Gary Cahill described England’s 2-1 defeat to Uruguay as the lowest point of his career. England are on the verge of elimination from the World Cup thanks to Luis Suarez’s deadly double in Sao Paulo. For England to qualify they need Italy to win their final two matches while the Three Lions must also beat Costa Rica in Belo Horizonte and hope they have a good enough goal difference. VIDEO - Scroll down to see fan reaction from both sides . Down and almost out: Cahill has that sinking feeling after the defeat to Uruguay . But Cahill thinks England are almost certainly out, judging by his mood after the match in Sao Paulo. 'It’s the worst feeling I have had as a player,' the England centre-back said. 'A few weeks ago this (the World Cup) was one of the highlights of my career and a couple of weeks down the line it’s one of the lowest points. 'The next four days are going to seem like forever. We just hope that Italy can perform really well in the next two games and leave the last game to try and get a win and that’s all we can do but we realise it’s going to be very tough.' Big moment: Cahill can't prevent Luis Suarez smashing home Uruguay's winner . Despite having knee surgery just four-and-a-half weeks ago, Suarez chased the England defence down all night. The controversial Liverpool striker sneaked in behind Cahill to head past Joe Hart in the first half and he wrapped up the win when he capitalised on a mistake by Steven Gerrard. Cahill believes the Uruguayan was very lucky with his second goal. 'He has a lot of energy and he is a great finisher, but sometimes as a forward you get a bit of luck,' the Chelsea defender said. 'He took his first goal very well. For the second goal he was very, very fortunate. Rooney hit the bar in the first half and the Manchester United forward went close with a curling free-kick. The centre-back is given a consoling pat on the head from Wayne Rooney . Englend's nemesis Luis Suarez consoles a dejected England captain Steven Gerrard . England had other chances to clinch the win, and Cahill believes the team were unfortunate to lose. 'I thought we gave a good account of ourselves,' said Cahill, who won his 26th cap on Thursday. 'I have played in teams a lot worse than this and come away with wins. 'Joe (Hart) came off and he said to me that he has had five or six shots on target to deal with over the two games and we have conceded four goals. It’s very tough to take. Sometimes football can be cruel.' Meanwhile, Phil Jagielka knows a remarkable turn of events are needed if they are to avoid becoming the first England side since 1958 to crash out at the World Cup group stage. England boss Roy Hodgson gathers his thoughts while coach Gary Neville (second right) watches the action . 'There’s a small chance but we are not exactly expecting something like that,' the centre-back said. 'We have to go out there and give a good performance against Costa Rica. 'We had them on the back foot. I’m not sure what went on with Daniel Sturridge’s penalty appeal, and we had a couple of chances, but obviously we just weren’t able to get that second goal. 'It it is a similar story to the Italy game. We played pretty well but not good enough.' Asked to sum up his feelings, Jagielka added: 'Gutting. We played so well again in spells. Stunned: Danny Welbeck was left reeling after Uruguay scored their first goal . 'It didn’t go our way with Steven (Gerrard) flicking the ball on, and you just hope that he mishits one, but he hit the target and they win the game.

Carlos Velasco Carballo had a good game in difficult circumstances. He is a strong referee who uses cards liberally in La Liga — but this is the World Cup. Referees have been told to be cautious with their cards and remember that a player misses a game for just two bookings. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Sportsmail's Neil Ashton and Charles Sale's verdict . Man in the middle: Spanish referee Carlos Velasco Carballo took charge of England against Uruguay . I am sure Velasco would have dismissed Diego Godin for his second yellow card in the first half but he held back and the Uruguayan captain was saved. As an England fan I was screaming at the television when Uruguayan players made heavy tackles. But there were plenty of dives by England players and Leighton Baines and Raheem Sterling were allowed to escape after strong challenges. England can have no complaints about the referee who was fair and impartial. In the book: Uruguay captain Diego Godin was shown a yellow card early on for handball .

"Tickets for beach volleyball were among the fastest to sell out at London's 2012 Olympics, despite it being little-played in the UK - and it even attracted Prince Harry. Audience members were quick to comment on - and photograph - the England team's enviably toned physiques - and now you can get the look because the likes of Zara Dampney and Shauna Mullin have launched a fitness class inspired by their sport. Dubbed Volleybody, it is a high-intensity fitness programme inspired by the training regimes of the world’s best beach volleyball players. Scroll down for video . Get the look: Members of Great Britain women's Beach Volleyball team, including Shauna Mullin and Zara Dampney (far right) have created a new fitness class based on their training regime called Volleybody . The exercise class is the brainchild of Katie Taylor, a marketing manager who saw the potential of turning the British beach volleyball team's training regime into a fitness programme. She teamed up with Olympians Zara Dampney and Shauna Mullin as well as Katie Eddy, a strength and conditioning coach, and Lucy Jones, a nutritionist and dietician. 'Volleybody is founded on the scientific training principles of a professional beach volleyball athlete’s physical programme, explains Taylor. In action: Shauna Mullin, left, and Zara Dampney, put the class, which incorporates ball skills, to the test . Jump to it: The classes cost £10 and the different exercises and drills aim to hone your body to perfection and boost fitness levels . 'The exercises take inspiration from three core moves within a volleyball game - defending, hitting and blocking a ball.' The class has broken down the team's training regime into simple moves, which focus on upper and lower body strength plus high intensity interval training. The 45-minute class is packed with skipping, squats, lunges, burpees and ball skills. The class is £10 and currently only available at Slice Studios in South West London but fitness programmes and video content can be downloaded online for £10 a month and the founders are hoping to roll it out across the UK soon.

"A young deaf woman was refused a job interview at a Darwin catering company after a staff member turned her away because she couldn't 'speak English'. Miranda Reardon has now lodged a formal complaint with the Northern Territory Anti-Discrimination Commission after she felt disappointed with the way she was treated. When she arrived at the office, she met with an interviewer named 'Angela' but was knocked back when Ms Reardon asked if she could write down what she was saying.

"As World Number One, he'd already set the tone on the green. And Rory McIlroy duly delivered a typically barnstorming performance when it came to the after party, as well. After Team Europe lifted the trophy yesterday evening at the Ryder Cup, the topless Northern Irish golfer got into 'the Scottish spirit' by donning a  red tartan kilt and an orange-coloured wig. And he wasn't the only member of Team Europe who took advantage of the chance to have a well-deserved little kickback after the impressive victory. The atmosphere was summed up when Welshman Jamie Donaldson - hailed as one of the main successes of the tournament - was asked by reporters whether the win had sunk in and he replied: 'No, because I'm still drunk.' Among the wild celebrations that ensued in Perthshire, there was exploding champagne, making friends with police officers and even the excuse to nearly drop off to sleep at a press conference. Scroll down for video . Is that you, Rory? The golfer got into the Scottish spirit during the after party in Gleneagles by donning a tartan kilt, a bright orange wig - and no top. He is pictured with Scottish team member Stephen Gallagher . They might not have been triumphant - but that didn't stop U.S golfers Rickie Fowler and Bubba Watson from joining in with the Scottish-themed attire . Meanwhile, Lee Westwood made no secret of all the fun he was having by posting several images on Twitter - including this one, of being given a lift home by police . During the press conference, Lee Westwood looked so dazed that it looked like he might fall asleep - until a champagne cork popped off and woke him with a startle . And it wasn't just the victorious who got into the party mood. U.S. golfers Rickie Fowler and Bubba Watson also joined in with fancy dress, posting a photo of themselves in traditional kilts and wigs on Instagram. McIlroy had also posted a photo of his Scottish-themed outfit to the site, saying: 'Got into the Scottish side of things'. Earlier in the day, the World Number One had started the celebrations early when a bottle of champagne popped prematurely, spraying all over him and Graeme McDowell. In hilarious footage, the pair were filmed looking on at the match between Zach Johnson and Victor Dubuisson when the bubbly suddenly exploded. McIlroy re-posted the video - which was captioned 'The only bad shot Rory McIlroy made all week!' - saying 'I swear this never usually happens!' Meanwhile, Lee Westwood made no secret of all the fun he was having, by posting a series of pictures online - one of which showed him getting a lift home with police officers. The 41-year-old had appeared a little worse for wear as he faced reporters at a conference earlier on Sunday evening. At one point, he looked so dazed  that it looked like he might fall asleep - until a champagne cork popped off and woke him with a startle. Welshman Jamie Donaldson said he was 'still drunk' when asked by reporters if the win had sunk in . In the video, Westwood is seen seen giggling and smiling - and pulling some hilarious faces - before appearing to almost drop off. He then pours himself a well-deserved drink, much to the delight of cameras at the conference. Westwood clearly continued to enjoy himself, later tweeting a photo of him getting a lift home with police officers. And this morning, he attempted to cure his hangover by having a so-called 'Breakfast of Champions' - including eggs, bacon, beans and sausages - a picture of which he posted to Twitter. He also shared one of his funny 'flashbacks' with his followers, describing how he sung Hey Jude with the band.

"In a game lacking goals it proved to be an eventful 90 minutes for Daniel Sturridge - on and off the ball - in England's 0-0 draw with Honduras. As the game was petering out in second half stoppage time, the Liverpool striker was struck by a beer can thrown from the crowd prompting the Liverpool striker to immediately turn his attention to the spectators. Incoming: Standing near the Honduras goal, a fan throws a beer can at Daniel Sturridge . Impact: The England striker reacts as he is struck by the beer can . Fury: Sturridge immediately engaged with the crowd following the incident . Caught on camera: TV cameras also caught the footage of the beer can being thrown at Sturridge . Offending object: The can which struck Sturridge lies by the side of the pitch . Sturridge engaged in dialogue with those in attendance, with the area containing England and Honduras supporters. It wasn't the first time the England hitman was targeted in the game, as he was also the victim of cynical play from Honduras' Emilio Izaguirre, who following a foul, directly kicked the ball into Sturridge's body while he lay on the ground following a trip. The incident led to Sturridge verbally confronting the Celtic star, who was lucky to only be booked for the unsportsmanlike play. By this point the game had already been stopped due to an electrical storm, but Sturridge was also guilty of missing three excellent chances to score. Taking one for the team: Emilio Izaguirre kicks the ball straight at Sturridge's body following a stoppage in play . Below the belt: Sturridge was tripped for a foul seconds before Izaguirre stuck the ball in retaliation . Angry reaction: Sturridge squared up to Izaguirre following the incident . The first resulted in him firing wide with just the keeper to beat, seconds before play was brought to a halt in the 23rd minute. The 24-year-old missed two decent opportunities in the second half too, the first an ambitious chip from inside the box drifting wide, while the second saw the former Chelsea forward header over unmarked from a Glen Johnson cross. Given the beer cans and nasty tactics thrown at Sturridge, boss Roy Hodgson will be glad the striker he is likely to start against Italy in England's World Cup opener didn't manage to get himself sent off. However he will hope that by the time the rumble in the jungle on June 14 comes round, Sturridge may have found his shooting boots.

"This is the tournament that will see Lionel Messi, at the age of 27, at his peak. Argentina have traditionally felt more comfortable when the tournament is played on their continent. They aim to win it. In their biggest rivals’ backyard. For Messi, this is his World Cup. The team revolves around Messi, although with team-mates in attack such as Sergio Aguero, Gonzalo Higuain and Angel di Maria, Argentina are the Real Madrid of national teams: they enjoy playing on the break, with pace. Now or never: This summer's World Cup is the tournament which will see Lionel Messi at his peak . Absolutely everything has been done to ensure Argentina, and Messi, arrive as serious contenders, including the appointment of a new coach. Despite a 4–1 win against Spain in September 2010, then manager Sergio Batista failed to combine the footballing growth of ‘The Flea’ with a team that worked. He failed in the Copa America held in Argentina in 2011,  losing to Uruguay in the quarter-finals. Alejandro Sabella came in and lifted spirits without making too much noise. The four forwards (Messi, Di Maria, Aguero and Higuain) had been developing an understanding and would be sure starters. And in midfield, a combination of Javier Mascherano’s tactical discipline and Fernando Gago’s touch made them leaders on and off the pitch. Serious contenders: Argentina coach Alejandro Sabella talks tactics with Messi during Friday's training session . In 571 minutes of World Cup football Lionel Messi has scored just one goal. Messi had Gago behind him and Aguero as his partner up front in both his titles with Argentina (Under 20 World Cup and the Olympic Games). They were reunited under Sabella. Messi, alongside team-mates who were on the same wavelength, began playing with  freedom. He started becoming Barcelona’s Messi. ‘The only thing I said as soon as I joined the national team was that he had to be left in peace,’ says Sabella. ‘He once missed a penalty and it was as if an asteroid had struck the Earth. Please! ‘Then they started, “What if he’s depressed...what’s happening to Messi?” It turns out that he scored five goals in the  following two matches. We have to understand that Messi is a human being.’ Sabella heeded advice from Pep Guardiola, the former Barcelona coach: ‘Protect him with players who make his job simpler.’ And make him feel loved, he added. With that in mind, the new coach gave Messi the captaincy. Former captain Mascherano says: ‘I was the one who gave it to him. I told him I would no longer be captain. I told Messi he had to be captain because of everything he represented for us. All smiles: Javier Mascherano (right) shares a joke with Fernando Gago, Maxi Rodriguez and Angel di Maria . ‘He was saying, “No! How? You are the captain!” and I was saying to him, “No, Leo, it has to be you”.’ Captaincy suited Messi. That is if you ignore his early team talks. Barcelona’s Gerard Pique recalls: ‘He told me that in Argentina they have a tradition of captains giving speeches before each match. When it was his turn, he said, “There is no speech today. Come on, let’s get on the pitch!” In his first match as captain!’ But, according to Manchester City’s Pablo Zabaleta, Messi gradually adapted to the responsibilities. ‘At the beginning he would speak to us on a more individual basis,’ says Zabaleta, ‘but now he says, “This is Argentina, let’s go for it from the start, remember the importance to the country”.’ Every king needs a coronation and Messi’s came on a very hot day in Barranquilla, Colombia. Argentina had already lost to Venezuela and drawn with Bolivia in their World Cup qualifiers. Then Colombia scored. ‘That match, when we came back with a spectacular second-half performance by Lionel, was key,’ remembers Argentine writer Eduardo Sacheri. ‘He made us win. It was epic: a Messi who can give no more, dying from the heat, on the brink of exhaustion...and he turned it around. We love those stories.’ At that moment Argentine society became reconciled with Leo. His performances under Sabella (20 goals in 22 games, when under previous coaches he had scored 17 in 61) matched those of the team. Messi,  Di Maria, Higuain and Aguero scored 90 per cent of  Argentina’s goals in qualifying. The idea of not winning in Brazil does not enter Messi’s head. It eats away at him that, although he feels he is No 1, he has not yet made history. High spirits: Messi laughs as Argentina team-mate Mascherano falls to the ground during training . ‘If we come back after the quarter-finals they will lambast him again,’ reflects Sacheri. ‘If he wins, maybe Diego (Maradona) will move aside. Or we put both on the altar, father and son. The advantage of Christianity is we can love more than one divine personality.’ Now that Messi has got used to being Messi, his goal is to win the World Cup. As if it were written in the stars.","Guillem Balague believes Argentina have fallen in love with Lionel Messi .

"Eyebrows were raised when Andy Murray announced Amelie Mauresmo as his new coach on Sunday, ahead of his Wimbledon defence later this month. And it hasn't taken the duo long to get down to business, as the British No. 1 practiced at Queen's Club on Wednesday. Mauresmo won the women's singles title at SW19 in 2006 and as a grass court specialist is seen as the ideal coach to help Murray retain the Wimbledon crown he memorably won last year after defeating Novak Djokovic.

Mauresmo already appeared to be sharing her insight and experience with the Scot, having observed himt practice his serving and general play from a few meters back before handing out a tip or two during a drinks break. Although Mauresmo's appointment came as a surprise, Sportsmail's Mike Dickson exclusively revealed last month that the two-time Grand Slam winner was set to become Murray's new coach.

She took her usual place in the stands along with Mauresmo and the rest of Murray's team as the 27-year-old began his bid to retain his Queen's title. Mauresmo replaces Ivan Lendl as Murray's coach after the Czech split from the British No. 1 in March following a successful two-year partnership. Mauresmo enjoyed a glittering 15-year playing which ended in 2009 - with here best year coming in 2006 where she won Wimbledon and the Australian Open - her only slam victories. AT SW19, Mauresmo's victory came off the back of serve and volley tennis and it's this expertise that has drawn Murray to appoint the Frenchwoman as his coach. Aside from slam victories, she became the first French player to become World No. 1 in 2004 - despite having not won a major - and went on to gain a silver medal at the Athens Olympics. It wasn't just Mauresmo's on court actions that received attention throughout the years. Get stuck in: Mauresmo shares some advice with Murray as the Scot takes a drinks break during practice .

The Frenchwoman came out as a lesbian at just 19 years old in 1999, a move which she admitted later was tough and led to jibes from fellow professionals Lindsey Davenport and Martina Hingis. However, Mauresmo also claims that coming to terms with her sexuality was a vital part of her success on the court, a success that would transfer to coaching. Mauresmo made her first entrance into coaching in 2010, guiding Michael Llodra, before then teaming up with then World No. 1 Victoria Azarenka two years later. Her most notable coaching success came last year, in helping guide Marion Bartoli to the 2013 Wimbledon crown. It was Bartoli's first grand slam victory and it came without dropping a set.

"Belgium's Romelu Lukaku is carrying the hopes of a nation on his shoulders in his first World Cup in the absence of injured Christian Benteke, but the forward is relishing the pressure that comes with the tournament.

"Ronald Koeman has been appointed as Southampton's new boss on a three-year-deal. The 51-year-old will replace Mauricio Pochettino in the St Mary's hotseat following his move to Premier League rivals Tottenham in May. Southampton executive director Les Reed said in a statement: 'From the moment we met with Ronald, it was clear he had the vision and ambition to take our club forward, that he shared our football philosophy and could see the opportunity to move our club to the next level. Main man: Southampton appointed Ronald Koeman (centre) as manager on a three-year-deal on Monday . In the hotseat: Koeman moves to Southampton after leaving Dutch outfit Feyenoord last season . Sibling love: Koeman's brother Erwin will join him as his assistant manager at Southampton . Replacement: Koeman has taken over from Mauricio Pochettino who joined Tottenham in May . Pure joy: Koeman scored the only goal in the 1992 European Cup final for Barcelona against Sampdoria . 'The club, the players and the fans will all be excited to have a man of Ronald's experience at the very highest level joining our club. 'Ronald's passion for the opportunity here at St Mary's was very clear, and we look forward to continuing our growth with him as part of our team.' Upon moving to the south coast club Koeman, who stepped down from his role as manager at Dutch outfit Feyenoord after guiding them to second place in the Eredivisie last season, will bring his brother Erwin as assistant manager. Koeman said: 'I am thrilled to be the manager of Southampton Football Club. 'From my very first meeting with Les Reed, I could see clearly that this was the right club for me. We share the same philosophy of football, and the same belief in how to develop the club. 'Southampton have a talented first-team squad, a world-class academy and the infrastructure to sustain success in the Premier League. 'The opportunity to continue the development of this famous football club was simply too good to turn down. I cannot wait to get started.' Pastures new: Koeman left Feyenoord in May after guiding them to second in the Dutch Eredivisie . Top stuff: Southampton enjoyed an impressive Premier League campaign last season, finishing eighth . On the move? Croatia defender Dejan Lovren has been linked with a summer transfer away from Southampton . The Dutchman comes with a reputation for an attacking brand of football and a commitment to promoting young talent which will sit well with Southampton who have nurtured the likes of Gareth Bale, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, Adam Lallana, Luke Shaw and Calum Chambers in recent seasons. Koeman, who won the European Championship with Holland and the European Cup with PSV in 1988 and with Barcelona four years later as a player, has also managed Ajax, Benfica, PSV Eindhoven, Valencia and AZ Alkmaar. He played 763 games for club and country, scoring 253 goals - including the winner for Barcelona against Sampdoria in the 1992 European Cup final at Wembley. The Dutchman inherits a Saints side who finished eighth in the Premier League in the previous campaign. One of his first tasks at Southampton will be to find a replacement for England international Rickie Lambert who signed for his boyhood club Liverpool in a £4million deal in May. As well as replacing Lambert, Koeman will have a fight on his hands to keep intergral trio Luke Shaw, Dejan Lovren and captain Adam Lallana at the club - who have all been linked away with a move this summer.","Southampton have appointed Ronald Koeman as their new boss .

"Maybe it is the location, something in the air. Joga bonito, and all that. Play beautifully. No country wants to come to a World Cup in Brazil, the spiritual home of football at its most compelling, and stink the place out. Again. That applies to England more than most. After a dismal experience in South Africa in 2010 and a week of predictions based around a dour, goalless draw, played at an Amazonian snail’s pace in the tropical heat, England came out of the blocks in Manaus as if set down at Anfield on a perfect autumn afternoon. Lost, obviously, but that happens in football. Sometimes you don’t get what you deserve. A fair few in the squad know all about that this season. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Sportsmail's Neil Ashton and Charles Sale reflect on Italy defeat . Forward thinking: Daniel Sturridge and England must carry on attacking if they are to get out of the group . More of this, please: Sturridge's goal came after a flowing, pacy counter-attack by England . Anyway, it is too late to change now. Roy Hodgson has arrived at this tournament with a battle-plan based around a sprightly, youthful, forward line, and must stick to it in Sao Paulo on Thursday. Defeat and England will be as good as out, but Hodgson cannot afford to think like that. To play Uruguay and Luis Suarez minus an element of risk would invite disaster; a draw that would put incredible pressure on a final win over Costa Rica or the breakaway goal that might seal England’s fate in the shortest time possible. For Uruguay coach Oscar Tabarez to play Suarez may be a gamble after rushing his return from injury, but have no doubt that he can score. He is a streetfighter and a street footballer with a desire that borders on insanity. The best way to put him, and Uruguay, out of business is to focus on a creaking, vulnerable defence that leaked three to Costa Rica. Late run: Raheem Sterling has come from virtually nowhere to be a major threat for England . Hodgson’s strategy out here as good as decides itself — embrace the spirit of Brazil, or bust. There is no alternative. Could we see more of him? Ross Barkley could be an alternative should England want to attack . England’s back line, sadly, is not set up to hold a lead. Had it been Daniel Sturridge, not Mario Balotelli, that had scored with a far post header in the 50th minute on Saturday, England would not have been able to see the game out with the certainty that Italy did. Cesare Prandelli’s players reverted to type once that goal went in, a bank of five in front of a fortress of four, as thick as tar through the middle, and England could find no way through. Wayne Rooney missed a good chance in the second half and Leighton Baines had a free-kick saved but as the game wore on genuine threats to goal grew fewer, as Italy’s vice grip got tighter and, if anything, they looked likelier to snatch a third on the break. Trading blows in front of goal the teams were evenly matched. What was clear, however, is that a plan of containment that was so effective in Ukraine for Hodgson will not fly for long out here. England must play to their strengths and if this makes contests more open than is traditionally considered healthy, so be it. Despite his protestations to the contrary, Hodgson is not a natural cavalier. Andros Townsend supplemented James Milner in the qualifying matches only when backs were to the wall and Raheem Sterling’s run into the first-team could not have been timed any later. Yet, like most coaches of experience, he is a pragmatist — and sometimes the most pragmatic means of defence is attack. Wide of the mark: Wayne Rooney missed a golden chance and did not look comfortable on the wing . Why do Liverpool play as they do, and Arsenal? It is simple. What other option do they have? Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers says he would never send a team out to suck the life from the game as Chelsea did at Anfield last season but the fact is, he couldn’t if he wished to. Not with Liverpool’s defence. If he ever gets a rearguard as reliable as his forwards — or as rugged as Chelsea’s — we shall see how loyal he is to those principles. For all the talk of a Liverpool way, their greatest teams under Bob Paisley, for instance, were not known for flying into away fixtures gung-ho. They could hold a lead as well as any collection of Italians, because they possessed some of Europe’s greatest defenders — Alan Hansen, Mark Lawrenson, Phil Neal, Steve Nicol, and plenty more. Ahead of them Graeme Souness protected the yard as fiercely as any Doberman on a chain. Arsenal under George Graham were the same. Arsene Wenger values winning beautifully and so there has been disproportionate focus on the front of the team in his tenure. The last time Arsenal defended for their lives was on the way to the Champions League final in 2006. Since then they have been gorgeously one-dimensional; but, then, they have to be. Picking up the pace: Danny Welbeck was part of England's front four against Italy . This is true of England, too. Hodgson picks the best back four available — notwithstanding the moot debate over Ashley Cole and Baines, and the closed door that is John Terry — but he will know deep down that it does not pass muster against the best attacking units here. It would be very dangerous indeed to imagine England could play a cautious game against Uruguay, nick a goal and sit on that lead. No time to change it: Hodgson must stick with the bold, attacking approach . The onslaught that started the match with Italy is undoubtedly the way to go once more. England must continue to make a virtue of the confidence of youth, the pace and technical ambition that came so close to establishing a significant lead in Manaus. Going into Sunday’s games, England topped the 14-team table for shots at goal. Greater accuracy is the key. If that is achieved, Uruguay will not withstand. If anything, they are considerably more vulnerable at the back than England. There is another reason to get on the front foot. At the last World Cup, of the 16 teams eliminated at the group stage, 14 failed to win their first game. Nine of those lost and five drew. Only Switzerland and Slovenia won and went out. The numbers after game two are even more worrying. Only three teams made it to round two without recording a victory in the opening two matches: England (two draws), United States (two draws) and Slovakia (draw, defeat). Hodgson cannot rely on his players getting so lucky again. ‘We are not the type of team to sit back and, unfortunately, that left one or two opportunities for Italy to get the ball in,’ said Hodgson. That will be true against Uruguay, too. It is scarcely believable that Suarez will not fashion at least one opportunity in front of goal, even half fit. England’s mission is to render this moment an irrelevance. There is only one way to achieve that. More of the same and let the best team win. Play your own game: England have to try to ensure any appearance by Luis Suarez is irrelevant .","England came out of the blocks fast against Italy in Manaus .

"With England looking for a late equaliser against the Italians, Wayne Rooney stepped up to take a corner won as Leighton Baines’ freekick was saved. Rooney, who often takes corners for Manchester United and England with some success, strode forward, taking three steps before striking the ball. But with his right boot he fired the dead ball opportunity into the Manaus sky and out for a goalkick without any other player getting close to touching the ball.

"Roy Hodgson risks riling Luis Suarez before Thursday’s showdown by claiming the Uruguay striker cannot yet claim to be true world class. The England manager says Suarez, who scored 31 times for Liverpool in the Barclays Premier League last season and was PFA Player of the Year, cannot be mentioned in the same class as true greats such as Diego Maradona or Pele until he performs wonders at the World Cup. Suarez is expected to start for Uruguay in the crunch clash with England in Sao Paulo. Speaking after England’s 2-1 defeat against Italy, Hodgson said: ‘He (Suarez) will only be at that level when he shows it on this particular stage. Not quite there: Roy Hodgson says Luis Suarez still has a way to go to be considered one of the world's best . Brave: The England manager is awaiting Uruguay and Suarez in the next World Cup Group D game . ‘If you are saying “do I think he has got the potential, is he a wonderful footballer?”, yes he sure is.  But if you are really going to put him up there with Maradona, Pele, Beckenbauer and Cruyff, you might argue Messi needs to have that sort of tournament to get up there with the legends. ‘Pirlo is challenging that category. He has done it time and again, shown what a wonderful footballer he is because this is the stage you have to do it on. ‘Being a great player in your league will get you lots of plaudits but for the world to recognise you are one of the all-time greats you have to do it at the World Cup.’ Suarez has been recovering from injury and watched Uruguay’s opening game, a 3-1 defeat against Costa Rica, from the substitutes’ bench. He will be desperate to face an England team which is likely to include five of his Liverpool team-mates. Hodgson turned his attention to Uruguay yesterday after the England team flew back to Rio de Janeiro from Manaus. Frustrating: Suarez, carrying an injury, was forced to watch on as Uruguay lost to Costa Rica on Saturday . Key man: Suarez was in superb form for Liverpool last season, notching 31 Premier League goals . Hodgson insists he will not panic but he admitted it is impossible to condition his young England stars to become world beaters overnight. Hodgson said: ‘We will try to cheer the players up, show them some of the things in the game that were very good and address some of the issues that need to be addressed. ‘But in my time with the national team, that is the most positive performance in many ways that I have seen. ‘It gives me great hope going forward, not just for the next two games, because we have players who can all develop into very strong players. ‘You can’t really expect Raheem Sterling, Daniel Sturridge, Danny Welbeck, Adam Lallana, Ross Barkley and Luke Shaw [to have] the experience of De Rossi and Pirlo. ‘We have to give them games. In a game which was very difficult I don’t think they let anyone down.’ Belief: Hodgson said his team can take plenty of pride from the 2-1 defeat to Italy in Manaus . Encouraging: Daniel Sturridge scored England's goal, a fine move in the first half . Hodgson admitted Italy were more ruthless in front of goal and will demand more from his forward line against Uruguay. Claudio Marchisio scored Italy’s opener and Mario Balotelli’s 50th-minute header was enough for victory. Hodgson said: ‘We were not outclassed but they were more ruthless at taking their chances. But the number of chances we created, even during the first half of the second half, should have given us an opportunity to score more than one goal.  We have to be a bit more ruthless. ‘Had we scored two or three goals I don’t think anybody would have said “you were lucky there”.’ Hodgson also admitted he will work on the team’s defensive vulnerability after Italy sliced through England’s backline for their second goal. Although the perceived weakness was at right back with Glen Johnson, Italy attacked down England’s left flank. They exposed Wayne Rooney, who had been shifted out there, and left-back Leighton Baines. Sloppy: Hodgson insisted his team will work on their defensive failures from the game . Hodgson said: ‘You can’t blame purely the left-back, we didn’t defend the area that well.  We were playing very offensive wide midfield players, Rooney, Welbeck and Sterling, we are going to get caught in those areas from time to time, I’m afraid. ‘We did much better second half defending it. The players gave their all.  I certainly wouldn’t be prepared to go and blame anybody. ‘There were some sterling efforts, if you’ll excuse the pun.  It just wasn’t good enough on the night.’ Hodgson was pleased with Sterling’s contribution and he has done more than enough to keep his place. Hodgson said: ‘The more I work with him, the more I see. At the moment, I am very happy that we can have him in two positions. ‘We thought with his pace, ability and sharpness around Pirlo and De Rossi, it might help us nullify [them]. However hard you work against them, especially in this heat and humidity, they are going to get on the ball.’ Star man: But on Saturday night, Sterling lit up the World Cup with a fine match against Italy . Hodgson has the option of using Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain on Thursday after the England midfielder started ball work following the injury to his right knee. Hodgson added: ‘I have the opportunity to make changes if I want, but I want to have a close look at the Italy game again.’ England’s head physio Gary Lewin has returned home after he fractured an ankle celebrating Daniel Sturridge’s equaliser. Lewin, a popular member of the England set-up, jumped into the air and landed on a water bottle when Sturridge tucked away Rooney’s cross. Hodgson said: ‘We will miss him. I am really sad for him but we can cover for him because we have extra physios. ‘For him to have such an unfortunate accident is really sad. We will miss him because he is very experienced, very popular, and close to the players and it was a heart-breaking moment.’","Hodgson says Suarez isn't in same league as Pele or Diego Maradona .

"Two teenagers have been arrested and one man is on the run after they allegedly recorded themselves sexually assaulting an unconscious girl before posting the video on Snapchat. Rashad Deihim, 19, is being sought by police while Kailyn Bonia, 18, and another male, 17, have been held after they allegedly filmed the attack in woods behind Waybright Elementary School in Sangus, Massachusetts. Police found the severely intoxicated 16-year-old after a man who saw the graphic footage on the photo-sharing app recognized the location and led them to the scene. Rashad Deihim, 19, (left) Kailyn Bonia, 18 (right) and another 17-year-old have been accused of recording themselves sexually assaulting of a girl in Sangus, Massachusetts, and uploading the video to Snapchat. Deihim is being sought by police after 'fleeing the state' while the other two have been held in custody . After he was shown the video by his daughter he rushed to the scene. He was then joined by a group of officers who found the alleged victim covered in cuts and bruises and wearing only a shirt. Judge Ellen Flately said the victim also had ligature marks around her neck and 'could have died'. According to the Boston Herald,  Bonia has been charged with assault with intent to rape, indecent assault and battery on a person over 14, exhibiting or posing a child in a state of nudity, and kidnapping. Deihim is believed to have fled the state and is wanted for the same charges as Bonia, according to court documents. Another male, 17, who is is said to have recorded the footage is also facing the same charges and has also been accused of distributing child pornography. A report by an officer who arrived at the scene said: 'The female appeared to be extremely intoxicated. I conducted a search of the area and located what we believe is the scene where the sexual activity took place on a floral print couch in the wooded area about 100 feet from the baseball field.' The victim was taken to Melrose-Wakefield Hospital  where doctors said she was under the influence of drugs. According to reports, when Bonia was arrested she called Deihim to alert him and said: 'Dude, I'm like being held for all these charges. Where is (juvenile defendant), this is all his fault. They should have him.' Police found the girl partially-naked and covered in cuts and bruises in woods behind Waybright Elementary School in Sangus, Massachusetts, after a man who saw the graphic footage recognized the location . The app has been accused of facilitating young people sending indecent or even illegal images to each other . The app allows users to send photos, videos and messages from their mobile phones. It launched in 2011 with messages and images would automatically deleting themselves within ten seconds of being opened by the recipient. Today, Snapchat users send 400 million photos and videos every single day, matching the daily uploads to Facebook and Instagram. The average age of users is 18. Last year Snapchat turned down a £1.8 billion ($3 billion) offer from Facebook, and while some doubted the app could grow further, the company was valued at a staggering £6 billion (£10 billion) two weeks ago. But despite the success, it has been mired in controversy. It has been accused of facilitating young people sending indecent and even illegal images to each other in a form of messaging now known as sexting. The app allows you to even send photos to people you have only met online and have not come face-to-face with. In Canada in November when ten teenage boys were arrested on child porn charges for saving and sharing Snapchat images of girls aged between 13 and 15. The girls sent the pictures believing they would disappear, not knowing there were ways of negating the time limit. Previously, Snapchat founder Evan Spiegel has dismissed concerns about sexting, arguing that because 80 per cent of the images are swapped during daylight he believes they are unlikely to have a sexual element. In May, the company agreed to settle with the Federal Trade Commission over charges that it deceived customers about the disappearing nature of messages sent through its service. The hit app came under fire after it failed to tell users that others could save their messages without their knowledge, and collected users' contacts without telling them or asking permission.","Severely intoxicated girl, 16 was found by police behind Waybright Elementary School in Sangus, Massachusetts .

Waco police spokesman Steve Anderson said they were continuing to investigate, but added that Adams, 'seeing her in so much pain and suffering, put her out of her misery', The Waco Tribune reported. Earlier yesterday he said: 'We will be considering a combination of things - what his physical condition is and what his mental condition is - and if charging him right now with murder for shooting his wife is in the best interest.' Adams had suffered a stroke last year and had difficulty communicating, according to a neighbour.

Robert Shaw, from the Cleveland suburb of Avon, was originally charged with aggravated murder for smothering his 84-year-old wife, Virginia, in November 2008. He pleaded guilty to involuntary manslaughter in June as part of a plea deal - for which he may be eligible for early release after serving six months. Shaw’s defense was that the death of his wife was a mercy killing to end the suffering she was enduring because of her many medical problems, which had caused her to be in and out of the hospital in the months leading up to her death.","Arrest warrant issued for Alvin Adams, who police say shot his wife dead .

It culminated in the arrest of 91 suspected Mafia figures as part of an alleged extortion racket operation based in western parts of Palermo, the island's capital and largest city.

'There . hasn't been a dragnet on this scale in many years,' finance police . Colonel Calogero Scibetta told Reuters. 'These arrests have wiped out . two entire mob families.' In recent years police have dealt severe blows to the Sicilian Mafia, historically Italy's most . powerful criminal group while 'Ndrangheta, which operates out of Calabria at the southern end of the Italian mainland, has grown in . strength by becoming a big importer of cocaine. Footage captured by police during their investigation shows suspected Mafia members meeting in various public locations in Palermo. In the screenshots taken from the video, captions reveal the suspects talking about the family, a shooting - and even the police investigation. One of . those arrested in the operation had boasted that his great-uncle killed a . New York City police officer dispatched to Sicily in 1909. Domenico Palazzotto, 28, said his family had celebrated the . 100th anniversary of the notorious murder of New York policeman Giuseppe 'Joe' Petrosino who was killed in 1909.

Cascio Ferro. Cascio Ferro, who died in 1943, was a 'godfather' in Sicilian Mafia, whose operations extended to the Black Hand - the Mafia's American counterpart. Police described the boast as an attempt by Palazzotto to establish his Mafia 'pedigree'. The details of the conversation were contained in the 872-page arrest warrant published today. The arrests come after Pope Francis shone a spotlight on the evils of Italian organised crime last weekend. During a trip to Calabria he said the 'Ndrangheta - a global drug trafficking syndicate and brother organisation to the Sicilian Mafia - was an example of the 'adoration of evil and contempt of the common good' and said mafia members were excommunicated from the Church. Murdered: Lieutenant Giuseppe 'Joe' Petrosino who was sent back to his native Italy on a special mission to investigate the Mafia in 1909 . Lieutenant Giuseppe 'Joe' Petrosino, an NYPD officer, was sent back to his native Italy in 1909 on a special mission to investigate criminal ties between the Sicilian Mafia and its increasingly powerful American counterpart, the Black Hand. Specifically, he was to collect evidence against Black Hand's alleged boss Don Vito Cascio Ferro, a Mafia 'godfather' who had gone into hiding in his native Sicily after being acquitted from murder charges in the US a few years earlier. Back in New York, Petrosino was in charge of an elite all-Italian squad that investigated the underworld of Italian migrants. He went on the mission despite being warned of the threat to his safety. A few days prior to his departure, American press published details of his mission - which was meant to be secret. Shortly after his arrival in Palermo, Petrosino was shot four times by unknown attackers in the city centre, where he was supposed to meet an informant. Cascio Ferro and Paolo Palazzotto were picked up by police after the shooting but were released due to lack of evidence. The identity of the killer has remained a mystery for more than 100 years.

"Phil Neville played 59 times for England and had his share of good days and bad. He was often a target for disgruntled fans who had to pin their disappointment on somebody. On Saturday he took a belly-load of flak without even putting his boots on. On BBC TV’s big World Cup catch, England’s opener against Italy, he provided co-commentary alongside Guy Mowbray. Phil Neville is a decent bloke with a lifelong grasp of the game but late on Saturday night into Sunday morning, his interpretation of the action in front of him was simply too low-key and flat. VIDEO Scroll down to watch a Man City fan give Phil Neville stick about Man United . Flat: Phil Neville was cast in an unfamiliar co-commentary role for England vs Italy and struggled, unlike his brother Gary (right) when he does the same job on Sky Sports . His brother, Gary, who won 85 caps, . was busy on the touchline on England duty but in his day job at Sky . Sports has blossomed from the sheer volume of opportunities that working . for them offers new recruits from football. Hours on the clock, so to . speak. Phil knows his stuff . and is a passionate Englishman but he was cast in a difficult and . unfamiliar role by his BBC bosses. He sounded more like he was in the . examination room for one of his coaching badges, not ‘ringside’ as two . European football heavyweights slugged it out toe-to-toe in the heat of . the Brazilian rainforest. Indeed, . his voice at times was so quiet he might as well have been auditioning . for one of BBC’s latest high-cost costume dramas. ‘It’s after midnight . here — for God’s sake speak up’, the nation was shouting at the telly. Warming up his vocal chords: Phil Neville (right) with the BBC team before the match in Manaus . In television sport, a huge amount of time and money is spent making sure the ‘showroom’, the TV studio, looks world-class and is filled with stellar names. They are the in-vision personalities and make the headlines. However, the commentary box is the real engine-room of any outside-broadcast. Just do the sums yourself. As viewers we spend more actual time in the company of the commentators than their studio-based colleagues. Sure, the opening titles, music, studio presentation, look, feel and contents give the output its distinctive style and tone, but I still think the hard yards are done in the commentary box. It is instinctive live broadcasting. Good team: Neville is part of a BBC line-up that has many impressive pundits and analysts . When the archive is raided for a memory it is the action and the voice that accompanies it that is on our screens, not how it was analysed later. A lot of attention and help is given to the studio guests, an aid not always replicated to those ‘on the road’. Viewing figures for England’s defeat were huge. The peak audience was 15.4million. 11.5m average, with over 12m still watching well after midnight. Fittingly, given the conditions in Manaus, BBC2 ran 1980s movie Body Heat, a steamy affair of an altogether  different nature, alongside it. ITV pick up the baton with England’s final two group games and will score heavily. Thursday evening’s crunch match with Uruguay has a peak-time 8pm kick-off and ITV bosses hope the match reaches 20m viewers at its peak. Laughing it off: Neville went on Twitter on Sunday to answer his critics . Elsewhere, I’ve enjoyed the Brazilian players singing their anthem with such unrestrained emotion, the Colombian goal celebrations, the free-kick ‘foam’, crowd shots of fans having a great time, Gabby Logan’s England reporting, Danny Murphy’s touchline thoughts, Fabio Cannavaro and Rio Ferdinand in their respective studios and BBC’s Tim Vickery, for his deep knowledge of South American football and their way of life.

No. 'Until we get that way of thinking, how do you win football matches? 'You start from the back, then you get organised.

"Alex Oxlade Chamberlain expects to be out for two weeks. Scans showed the knee injury he suffered against Ecuador on Wednesday night was not as bad as first feared but it still leaves Roy Hodgson with a difficult decision to make. Oxlade-Chamberlain has a slight strain in his medial ligaments and not a tear. It gives the 20-year-old Arsenal midfielder – who was seen leaving the team hotel for training with his team mates in Miami, with a brace on his right knee. He has not given up hope of featuring in the World Cup. England’s first game is on Saturday week against Italy in Manaus but Hodgson must decide whether to gamble on the fitness of a player who has been beset by injuries this season.

Awkward: Ecuador midfielder Carlos Gruezo landed awkwardly on the knee of the midfielder . Concern: Roy Hodgson said it is too early to make a decision on what happens next with Oxlade-Chamberlain .

In pain: England players look glum as they surround the hurt Arsenal midfielder . Hurt: Oxlade-Chamberlain will have a scan to check the full extent of the damage . Performed: The youngster put in a terrific performance in Miami before he was forced off . The official England Twitter feed posted: '@Alex_OxChambo sustained a medial knee ligament injury against Ecuador. The team medics are continuing to monitor and treat injury.' Oxlade-Chamberlain suffered a cruciate ligament injury at the start of the season and has been troubled by a groin injury during the final weeks of the season. The game against Ecuador in Miami was his first start for nearly two months but he has been able to complete all the intensive England fitness work since the squad assembled last month. He may lack match sharpness but looked in good touch during the 2-2 draw last night. Hodgson may opt to take Oxlade-Chamberlain to Brazil and delay his final decision. The squad lists were lodged with FIFA earlier this week but teams are allowed to make changes if there is a new injury, up 24 hours before their first game. There is nothing to stop the England boss calling in a player who is not on the stand-by list but Hodgson may well turn to Jon Flanagan or John Stones because they have been with the squad for more than two weeks and have done all the acclimatisation training.

"Take a bunch of red-hot Chile peppers, stir in a simmering measure of brooding Argentine volatility, bring quickly to the boil and pour down the throats of the European aristocrats who strolled in here as the champions of world football. Poor old Spain had no chance. They are going home choking on that fiery recipe. Chile's Argentinian manager Jorge Sampaoli refers to his players as 'my courageous rebels.' VIDEO Team Profile: Chile . Gifted: Barcelona and Chile forward Alexis Sanchez played a key role in Spain's downfall . When they play with the irreverent passion which lit up the Maracana on Wednesday night, Chile can indeed over-throw pretty well any established order. Yet off the pitch the beautifully gifted Alexis Sanchez and his team-mates come across as the most relaxed footballers at Brazil 2014. That paradox is a major part of what makes this Chile team so refreshingly unpredictable to deal with. They are without fear. As a football nation they have learned to live with defeat down the decades so now they are taking their triumphs one by one, celebrating each as if they have won the World Cup. What do they have to lose? These players or the multitude of fans, inside and outside the stadium, who made such an ecstatic racket that it might have been heard back in Santiago? Team spirit: Chile boss Jorge Sampaoli talks with the players during a training session on Thursday . Nothing. Not when they have knocked out the World Cup holders with a team including two men who will be playing not in our Premier League next season but down in the Championship? Defenders Gonzalo Jara, of Nottingham Forest, and Gary Medel, just relegated with Cardiff City, shut out the multi-million pound talents of Diego Costa, David Silva and Fernando Torrres as if they were run-of-the-mill opponents on any old Saturday afternoon in England. But then rebels with a cause don't tend to suffer from an inferiority complex. 'We knew we could beat Spain,' said Sampaoli. 'They have been a great team for six years but we have always given them trouble by daring to attack them. The way we risk going at everybody. We also knew that success is not forever.' Break time: Chile coach Jorge Sampaoli with defender Gary Medel (centre) and midfielder Arturo Vidal . This manager is a walking contradiction, too. For 90 minutes on the touchline he looks as if he is suffering an apoplectic fit. No sooner does the final whistle blow than he is gently  embracing Vicente del Bosque, sympathising with his Spanish counter-part and reminding him of how proud he should be of all those achievements. As for the players, they are from the people, of the people and united with the people. No prima-donna celebrities here. They mingle with their countrymen and women, happily posing for 'selifies', chatting about the game. And you suspect they sympathise privately with their couple of hundred of ticketless red-shirted fans who stormed the barricades at the Maracana and broke through walls at the media centre in their bid to see the match. Sanchez & Co did not have to force entry to the stadium but they did their bravura rampaging on the pitch. This group are no respecters of reputations. Carlos Bravo, their captain whose assured goalkeeping provided a solid foundation for this victory which has changed the direction of world football,l warns the rest of the  best when he says;  'We go out to tackle every match the same way, whoever our opponents are. And now we have a weight lifted from us because we've proved we are a strong team.' England learned how strong when Chile won that warm-up friendly at Wembley. Red hot: Chile coach Jorge Sampaoli celebrates the 2-0 win over Spain . Hammer blow: Eduardo Vargas (1st R) scores Chile's first goal against Spain . Defeat for Spain, when it really mattered, was more profoundly devastating and all the harder to stomach  because Sanchez helped inflict it on a number of his team-mates at Barcelona. He was not one of the two scorers but he is their principle hope for progressing even further than the last 16, for which they have already qualified so spectacularly. Whether they do so may depend on them upsetting Holland the bold way they turned over Spain. They and the Dutch are both going through in high style but the losers of that final group game are most likely to face Brazil in the first knock-out stage. And the host nation are the only ones about whom the Chileans do nurse a paronoia. Not surprisingly since a home win in a World Cup qualifying game in 2008 represents their only victory over Brazil in 21 years and 16 matches.  Not only that but their record against them is played 70, won 8, drawn 12…..and lost 50. Might Senor Sampaoli be the one to make them fly in the face of such daunting history, if necessary? Maybe. Since he had not enjoyed significant success as manager of a variety of clubs across South America, he was an unusual choice to begin with. And perhaps, when asked if beating Spain was his best victory, he was being prophetic as well as philosophical when he replied: 'The best victory is always the next victory.'","Chile beat Spain 2-0 to dump the World Cup holders out of 2014's tournament .

"John Terry has shown England just what they were missing as the former Three Lions captain throws punches and kicks in a personal training session. It was, perhaps, the style of defence that England could have done with as Uruguay and Liverpool striker Luis Suarez almost single-handedly left Roy Hodgson's World Cup in tatters. Terry has had no competitive football to prepare for, having retired from the national team in 2012, but looks to be keeping himself in shape ahead of Chelsea's next Premier League campaign.

Along with the video, Terry wrote: 'Gym session done #algarve #gettingreadyforpreseason' Terry's displays at Chelsea warranted calls from the media for him to return for the tournament in Brazil, but the defender had already decided 78 caps were enough.

Uruguay have rushed their talismanic striker back into the side but he still lacks full fitness and Cahill will hope that will make his task a little easier against the Premier League’s top scorer.

"Gazing at myself in the changing room mirror, I was lost for words. I’d just wriggled into the dress of my dreams. But looking back at me was something that resembled the Michelin man. I didn’t just have a visible panty line, but I could practically read the wash-care label. After two children, I expect a smidge of mum-tum. But, in this dress, I looked at least three months gone. I had little pouches of flab poking out from under each armpit, and my bust, which I normally consider one of my best features, seemed to have morphed into a solid bolster of flesh. I wasn’t just mortified, I was desperately disappointed. Scroll down for video . After two children, Claire expects a smidge of mum-tum. But, in this dress, she felt she looked at least three months gone . Ever since Victoria Beckham started designing clothes, I’ve longed to own one of her dresses. I would have killed for that long, simple, stone-coloured gown she wore to the Vanity Fair Oscars party in 2012. I was even quietly fond of the billowy, pale-blue tent dress she unveiled last year. And I loved her sleek collection, unveiled at New York Fashion Week. So, as you might expect, I was one of the first through the doors of her London store when it opened last week, edging past the paparazzi and the gang in high-viz jackets (who were not, as I’d assumed from the other end of the street, a group of cutting-edge fashionistas, but merely the builders who had yet to finish). Victoria Beckham has a pair of fluorescent green trainers with 'Posh' on the tongue . I’d taken the precaution of dressing in homage to VB herself: a white shirt, buttoned up the way she does it, skinny trousers, my most impenetrable sunglasses and a designer handbag. I didn’t want to be escorted off the premises for looking too scruffy. But I needn’t have worried. Victoria had declared her shop would be a welcoming place. ‘I think we’ve all been into stores where we’ve been made to feel like we shouldn’t really be there,’ she said. ‘I don’t want people to feel frightened, or scared to come in.’ And, indeed, the intimidating-looking bouncer guarding the door flashed me a friendly smile as I stepped in. The place was teeming with an eclectic mix of customers: students in ripped jeans, Instagramming everything in sight; middle-aged women, browsing with bemused husbands in tow; Essex girls, clutching armfuls of handbags and swigging heartily on the glasses of free champagne. Victoria Beckham poses in her swish Mayfair boutique, where she says all variety of customers should feel comfortable shopping . There’s nothing so vulgar as a cash till in the store — VB having decreed them ‘ugly’ — so, instead, wherever you are, you hand over your card to an assistant, who swipes it through a little machine. Tragically, I’d missed Dishy David himself, but Amy Childs, the former Towie star, was there, examining the sunglasses. Clearly, VB’s dream of a shop that could be all things to all people had come off. I was almost salivating as I strode up the polished steps (thank goodness flat shoes are in this season) to the first floor, in search of the perfect frock. On the pin-thin models in Victoria’s catwalk show, projected on to a giant screen at the top of the stairs, everything looked irresistible. Claire tried to emulate the ever-stylish Mrs Beckham with a tailored outfit for her first visit to the boutique . Upstairs, the ready-to-wear collection was a comparative oasis of calm, scented deliciously with Diptyque’s Feu de Bois candles. Accepting a glass of fizzy, I settled down on a walnut bench and surveyed the clothes. They hung on individual gold chains, rather than rails, and I flicked through them with care. The prices were sky-high — from £900 to £3,000 for evening dresses, with one gown at £5,800. The shapes were classic Victoria: slim and pared-down, in red, navy, black and white. There were perfect little knits, sequinned skirts and gorgeous, A-line frocks with graphic patterns. I was in sartorial heaven. Then, I saw it smiling at me: the party dress I had been longing for. It was a simple, clingy, black dress in a mix of silk, wool and viscose, with VB’s familiar, full-length zip down the back and silky contrast on the shoulders. It looked as though it had been made for me. It cost an eye-watering £1,625. But, I reasoned, such a classic shape would never go out of fashion and it would be supremely flattering. There was just one slight problem: there were only two of these dresses on the shop floor — one in a size eight, the other in a ten. I’m a size 14, although in some shops I can get away with a 12 on my bottom half. Would a fashion designer famed for her bird-like frame even bother dressing a woman like me? Now, surely, was the moment I would be politely asked to leave and never darken her dainty doors again. I took the plunge and turned to the assistant who, like all the staff I saw, was tiny and perfectly formed. Perhaps that’s no surprise, since VB reportedly picked them herself, but it was starting to make me feel like Gulliver in Lilliput. An assistant escorted me to one of the huge changing rooms and came back with three different size 14 frocks. ‘Would you like heels to try them on with?’ he offered. ‘Oh yes, please!’ I said. ‘I’m a size eight.’ His face fell. ‘I think we only go up to a size seven, but I’ll go and look.’ Although the store's opening saw fans queuing outside, Claire says the sky high prices are inaccessible for the average clothes shopper . The instant he’d gone, I reverently slipped the first dress from its padded hanger and stepped into it. This glorious garment, I just knew, was going to skim over my lumps and bumps, while holding me in in all the right places. Unfortunately, the dress had other ideas. In fact, I had a bit of a problem even getting the zip done up. And when I looked at myself in the mirror, I didn’t know whether to laugh or cry. I had hoped to look like Holly Golightly, but before my horrified gaze stood something that looked like an exploding bin bag. When the assistant came back with the bad news that even my feet were too big for this shop, I asked, in a whisper, whether he had the dress in a size 16. Clair still loves Victoria Beckham’s clothes but will not be back in her beautiful shop until she has dropped a couple of dress sizes . To his eternal credit, he didn’t sneer, or even raise a groomed eyebrow. He simply explained, politely: ‘We’re working on it.’ And perhaps he was even telling the truth. But, as I slunk back down the stairs, feeling fatter than ever, those runway models seemed to be gazing accusingly at my wobbly behind. Following in the teetering heels of Amy Childs, I made my way past the sliding, concrete door. A reporter rushed up to me, keen to hear my first impressions of the shop. But I was in no mood to chat. Frankly, I just wanted to be left alone — with a packet of Weight Watchers biscuits. I still love VB’s clothes. But I will not be back in her beautiful shop until I’ve dropped a couple of dress sizes.","After two children, Claire expects a smidge of mum-tum .

"Lucky: Jack Russells, Daisy and Molly, had to be resuscitated by firefighters . Firefighters have rescued a bizarre collection of animals after tackling a blaze at a home with more than 100 pets including cats, dogs, rabbits, ferrets, chickens and even an iguana. They had to resuscitate two dogs moments from death after responding to the call from worried neighbours in Southampton, Hampshire, at 9am yesterday morning. The crew fought to put out the kitchen fire and get the animals to safety, with the help of owners Derek and Jacqui Rankin, but sadly a cat, a dog, a ferret and a bird died of smoke inhalation. One person was also treated by the South Central Ambulance Service for smoke inhalation. Officer in charge, watch manager Jason Brattle, said: 'Crews worked extremely hard to control the fire whilst being faced with an unusual situation involving so many animals. 'As crews gained entry they were exposed to six dogs who would naturally protect their property and were scared. 'Firefighters dealt with the situation extremely well to knock down the fire and save so many animals.' The crews used four sets of breathing apparatus, two jets and two hose reels to tackle the blaze. A Hampshire Fire Service spokesman said: 'We believe these were all domestic pets. They may have bred some animals but as far as we are aware they are domestic pets. No animals are missing.' Firefighers also worked together with the RSPCA to formulate a plan going forward to protect the animals. It is believed that the fire was caused by an electrical fault. Owners, Mr and Mrs Rankin, confirmed their nine-year-old chihuahua, named Olly, died of smoke inhalation along with a cat that they had been looking after for around a month. The blaze comes just a week after 20 Staffordshire bull terriers were killed in a fire at a breeder's home in East Yorkshire.

"However brief this World Cup has proved for England, it is developing rather nicely for Manchester United. Undeniably so, given the bond that appears to exist between Louis Van Gaal and Robin Van Persie here in Brazil. A bond between coach and captain that has been central to the success the Dutch have so far enjoyed, first in crushing Spain and then seeing off a spirited Australia team. What is good for Holland is also, you would imagine, going to be rather significant for United. VIDEO Scroll down for Robin van Persie: Rooney not to blame for England's exit . Special relationship: Robin van Persie and Louis van Gaal high five after the former's first goal against Spain . Loyalty: The Dutch manager Louis van Gaal is set to take over at Old Trafford after the tournament . ‘I’m sure with Van Gaal and Robin great things are going to happen at Old Trafford,’ observed Dirk Kuyt after Holland’s 3-2 defeat of the Australians in Porto Alegre. ‘Unfortunately,’ the former Liverpool forward then added with a smile. It is a fascinating dynamic, and one that goes someway to exploding the myth that United’s new manager rules only with an autocratic approach. The truth is that as well as consulting Van Persie on the tactics for the Dutch team, he has even sought his opinion on when it would be appropriate to invite the players’ families to the team hotel. Such dialogue might be something that concerns Wayne Rooney when he likes to be ‘the big man’ but it is likely to be a source of encouragement for the United players who were slightly baffled by the way David Moyes indulged the England striker when Sir Alex Ferguson had lost complete patience with him the previous season. Moyes would probably agree he gave Rooney too much attention, given how disaffected his treatment of the 28-year-old is thought to have left individuals like Van Persie. As Ferguson revealed in his autobiography last year, he grew increasingly frustrated with Rooney on a number of fronts. Most notably with the way Rooney’s ability could be ‘swallowed up by a lack of fitness’, adding that he had  ‘lost some of his old thrust’. He also confirmed that he had indeed had to reprimand him for turning up at Carrington on one particular occasion in no fit state to train. The relationship between Ferguson and . Rooney began to erode as far back as 2010, when Rooney handed in a . transfer request. Ferguson covered the episode in great detail in the . same autobiography, just as he confirmed that Rooney had asked to leave . for a second time, albeit verbally, towards the end of the 2012/13 . campaign. Understandably, . the players were more inclined to side with Ferguson and it meant they . were somewhat disappointed to see Moyes’s making Rooney the focal point . of the team when that role had been occupied by Van Persie the previous, . championship-winning season. With . Van Gaal now coming in, Van Persie’s status is sure to be restored. In . fact there is every chance he will be made club captain. This . is not to say Rooney will be ignored. On the contrary, Van Gaal knows . Rooney remains a talented footballer. But he would have also noted how . Van Persie has comfortably upstaged his club colleague at this . tournament, even if Rooney was among England’s better players against . Uruguay. It sure to lead to a . culture change at United, with the  Dutch calling the shots in a . collective effort to guide United back to the summit of the English . game. Popular: Dirk Kuyt with his Holland boss in training . Rally: Van Gaal overseeing a training session . Together Van Gaal and Van Persie already appear to have made great strides for Holland, despite the fact that the relationship that exists between them took time to evolve. It actually started rather badly, Van Gaal emerging from his first encounter with the squad - a meeting designed to establish what had gone wrong for the Dutch at Euro 2012 under the guidance of Bert Van Marwikk – distinctly unimpressed with Van Persie. Van Gaal wanted the players to be candid but Van Persie stayed silent. Van Gaal asked him why. ‘Because it’s all in the past and a lot of rubbish was written about it,’ Van Persie is said to have replied in reference to suggestions he was part of a divisive clique that developed within the squad at that tournament. As a consequence Van Gaal omitted Van Persie from his first game in charge, instead selecting Klaas-Jan Huntelaar for a friendly against Belgium. That night news of Van Persie’s move to United would emerge. On the same evening Van Gaal would note how Huntelaar struggled to operate in tight spaces. Having declared he was a coach who would give a player three or four games to establish themselves, he dropped Huntelaar for Van Persie for the opening World Cup qualifier against Turkey. By then Van Gaal had observed how well Van Persie had started the new season at Old Trafford and within 17 minutes of the game against Turkey he had scored to cement his place with Holland too. ‘The real love began on a summer tour of Asia at the end of the season,’ recalled a leading Dutch sports writer this week. With then captain Wesley Sneijder . struggling for fitness, and Van Gaal noting how supportive Van Persie . was of some of the younger players in the squad – in particular the . Feyenoord players Daryl Janmaat, Stefan De Vrij, Bruno Martins Indi and . Jordy Clasie – an important decision was made. For a friendly against Indonesia on June 7 last year, Van Persie was appointed Holland captain. By . the following March Van Persie was being consulted on tactics. After a . difficult game against France, a contest in which Van Persie enjoyed . Holland’s one decent chance in a 2-0 defeat, Van Gaal and Van Persie sat . in the bar in their Paris hotel and discussed the possibility of . switching from their traditional 4-3-3 formation to a back three. The . idea was to employ a system that would create more space for Van Persie . and Arjen Robben. Something that certainly worked against Spain.\ . Pained: Van Persie's performances have outshone that of team-mate Wayne Rooney . Pivotal: The fortunes of Holland will rest largely on the shoulders of Van Persie's partnership with Arjen Robben . With Van Persie in Holland to rehabilitate from injury soon afterwards, Van Gaal took the opportunity to take him to matches to see Dutch club sides already using the system. And Van Persie liked it so much he and Sneijder convinced Van Gaal to stick with a back three when the former Barcelona coach had suggested 4-3-3 would be better suited to playing Australia this week. ‘If they say that I’m going to listen to them,’ said Van Gaal on the eve of the match, although as it turned out he should have gone with his instincts. Shortly before the end of a difficult first half he abandoned 3-5-2 and went back to 4-3-3, winning the game as a result. Prior to the Spain game Van Gaal asked Van Persie how he felt about families visiting the team hotel on the day of the match. Van Persie thought it a good idea, not least because the players were feeling anxious ahead of a meeting with the defending world champions. So five hours before kick-off around 50 family members, among them Van Persie’s wife and children, arrived in the lobby of the Sofitel in Salvador. A few hours later and Van Persie would celebrate a stunning goal against Spain by high-fiving his coach. ‘He is a good teacher; very direct,’ Van Persie has said of Van Gaal. ‘He has already studied the opponent before the training session so he has all the answers before we start. I like that about him.’ His door, say his players and coaching staff, is always open. ‘If you watch every player the relationship with the manager is very, very good,’ said Kuyt. ‘But everyone can see Robin has a great connection with him. ‘The manager has an open style. If you want something to change you can speak to him. You just have to have a very good argument!’","Van Persie and Van Gaal relationship will benefit Man Utd, believes Kuyt .

"Whoever beats Brazil wins the World Cup this summer. It’s that simple for me, for reasons I’ll explain in a moment, and Argentina and Portugal — with one massive caveat — are the two biggest challengers to the hosts. The caveat is whether Cristiano Ronaldo, the world’s best footballer, is fully fit and playing at his peak. If he is, and it’s a big if, then I think the Portuguese are capable of being the cat among the pigeons.Can you imagine a final that pits  Ronaldo on one side against the world’s second-best player, Lionel Messi, on the other? It would be a fantasy showdown. I for one would absolutely love to see that happen. Influence: Cristiano Ronaldo could lead Portugal to World Cup glory in Brazil this summer . Crucial: With Ronaldo in their team, Portugal could go all the way to the final in Rio De Janeiro . Tough: Portugal have been drawn in group G alongside Germany, Ghana and the USA . If you think Cristiano has an  enormous ego already, imagine what it would be like if he reached the World Cup final! As a big fan of his, as well as his friend, I relish the prospect of that spectacle. He’s a showman and this is the biggest show. People see his ego — and don’t get me wrong, Cristiano’s ego is gargantuan! — but that is his fuel. It’s his inspiration. He reads all the articles written comparing him with Messi. ‘How can they say Messi is better than me?’ he’ll ask. ‘I’ll prove that writer wrong.’ That’s his mindset. Driven. Self-obsessed in the most positive way. Always looking to improve. That’s why he has become what he is, through effort and determination. It didn’t all come naturally. He worked hard at technique and hitting the ball. He’s the hardest worker I’ve had the privilege to play alongside. He’s a great team-mate, a companionable man, always involved in the changing room. But when it’s time to work he’s passionate about what he does and his emotion comes out. Support: Hosts Brazil are among the favourites to be crowned world champions this summer . Heavyweights: Lionel Messi's Argentina team have been tipped to win the World Cup . Predictions: Rio Ferdinand is tipping Brazil to be victorious in the World Cup on home soil . People say he stole Gareth Bale’s thunder in the Champions League final. Eh? He took his shirt off. He’s got an unbelievable physique and his girlfriend is a supermodel, and someone’s criticising him for taking his shirt off? The exhibitionist is part of who he is. But away from the field of play he’s one of the nicest kids you could meet. He makes time for fans, he’ll sit around a table late into the night talking. He’s no lone wolf. He first came to our attention at Manchester United when we played Sporting Lisbon in 2003. By half-time he’d razzle-dazzled us and we were all in the dressing room asking: ‘Who the hell is this kid? We MUST sign him!’ And Sir Alex did. He arrived at Old Trafford with his tricks and his stepovers and his attitude. What a young showpony he was, wanting to look good, then be good, in that order. The wrong order. Fergie had a word or three over time, and so did Ronnie’s hugely influential compatriot, Carlos Queiroz, and we as team-mates let him know there needed to be an end product to his skills. Side by side: Rio Ferdinand and Ronaldo together in their Manchester United days . Upstaged? Cristiano Ronaldo took his shirt off after scoring a penalty in the Champions League final . Change:  Ronaldo left Sporting Lisbon in 2003 to join Manchester United, where he became a star . To his enormous credit, the penny dropped, and he took it all on board and started on his journey to become the world’s best. There are players who maybe have more natural talent and the penny never drops for them. You will have guessed by now that I’m a fan of CR7’s work! I hope for him that he has a standout World Cup. With him on fire, Portugal can make huge waves. Without him, they’re half a team or less. With my pragmatist’s hat on, and fearing that seven games could be a few too far for Portugal if Ronaldo isn’t 100 per cent physically well, I believe we’ll see a Brazil-Argentina final. And I think that Brazil, inspired by the maverick genius of Neymar, will be triumphant on home soil.I see Brazil overcoming Germany (if not Portugal) in one semi-final, and Argentina beating Spain in the other. I think Holland might struggle to get out of Group B, that Spain should win, because Chile are a fine team, although Robin van Persie is a match-winner. Colombia and Ivory Coast should come through Group C and England’s group are dealt with elsewhere: Italy plus one, basically. France win Group E for me, and Argentina take F, with Germany and  Portugal coming out of G and probably Belgium winning H. Pressure: Neymar is the poster boy of the World Cup and is expected to fire Brazil to glory . Tricky: 2010 finalists Spain and Netherlands have been drawn in the same group this time . Shining light: With Messi leading the line, Argentina have an number of attacking options . The Belgians should win their group, but they are a peculiar prospect in some ways. They could be the team everyone believes they are capable of being and reach the last eight or further. Or they could be the biggest burster of expectations because their youth and inexperience may tell at this level. Argentina have a strength in depth that means they could cope without Messi if they had to. It tells you something when a player of Carlos Tevez’s qualities didn’t even make the cut. Aside from Messi, they have Gonzalo Higuain, Sergio Aguero — the world’s best natural goalscorer in my book — as well as Angel Di Maria, one of the stars of the Champions League last season, and Ezequiel Lavezzi, and on and on. The one area of caution is defence, but it’s hardly shabby. As big an admirer of Spain as I have been in recent times, I do think this could be a tournament too far as age starts to tell. But they’ll still go far. But not as far as Brazil. The Confederations Cup victory last summer was a fillip that cannot be understated. They know now they can perform and win under that enormous home pressure. Sunning up: Juventus forward Carlos Tevez missed out on Argentina's World Cup squad . Dark horse: Chelsea playmaker Eden Hazard will lead Belgium's quest at the World Cup . In Neymar they have a player who bucks a common trend of great performances for club and indifferent games for country. He pulls on his Brazil shirt and shines. He is Brazil’s go-to guy for inspiration, and backing him up he has a cast awash with talent and no small amount of toughness, exemplified by Fernandinho, who is a top player. Ramires is a great athlete, so too Willian. Oscar will score and Hulk is a danger. Brazil’s Achilles heel for me is a lack of a traditional No 9 but they have enough elsewhere to compensate. As they say in Rio: Vamos! Rio Ferdinand is an interviewer, programme-maker and football expert for BT Sport .","Cristiano Ronaldo could be the only one to stop a Brazil-Argentina final .

"On Raheem Sterling’s left wrist there is a tattoo of a young boy wearing a No 10 shirt and looking longingly at Wembley Stadium. Sterling grew up on the mean streets of the notorious Stone-bridge Park estate and used to ride his bike with his mates to Wembley market on a Sunday morning. In the shadow of the new stadium they would play football in the car parks and dream of growing up to represent their country at a World Cup. Last Saturday, in Manaus, Sterling slipped on the shirt for real. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Raheem Sterling talk ahead of England's crucial Uruguay clash . Dreamer: Raheem Sterling's fantasy has now become a reality as he prepares to lead England's charge . ‘I’ve got a tattoo of the stadium, a young boy with a football in his hands looking at the stadium and saying it’s a dream. ‘The stadium was literally round the corner and I’ve always wanted to play for England and be the best I can be. ‘I grew up five minutes away from the stadium. I used to ride my bike around this little car park and I used to say to myself, “One day, when this stadium is built, I’d like to play in there”. I am really  grateful to be given that opportunity.’ Sterling impressed against Italy after he was thrust into the role just behind Daniel Sturridge during England’s opening group game. It was Sterling’s pass out to Wayne Rooney on the left that began the move which led to Sturridge’s 37th-minute equaliser in the Arena Amazonia. Sterling showed no fear. ‘Every time I had the ball there were about three players around me,’ he said. Italy recognised his qualities from the off. Youngster: Sterling has enjoyed a quick rise to the top after climbing through the ranks at Liverpool . All smiles: Sterling shares a joke with England team-mate Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain during training . Raheem Sterling made an impressive start to his World Cup against Italy. The youngster had four shots at goal, more than any other England player. As his confidence grew in the  second half, he even sprinted back nearly 40 yards to cheekily  dispossess the great Andrea Pirlo when he was idling on the ball just outside England’s penalty area. ‘I knew it was him on the ball and I will do anything for my team if it is something that I need to do,’ he added matter-of-factly. ‘To take it off such a good player is something I needed to do, but in the first half there was no point pressing him because he is so good he would just bounce around the corner.’ Sterling shows no inhibitions and this streetwise kid is ready for the next phase of his international career against Uruguay on Thursday in Sao Paulo. The England forward can make things happen and he has come a long way since his Anfield manager Brendan Rodgers barked out ‘Sterling - if you say ""steady"" one more time you’ll be on the first flight home’ in the Channel 5 documentary Being: Liverpool in the summer of 2012. Two years on, after a brilliant second half of the season alongside Sturridge and Luis Suarez, he knows the qualities required to stay at the top of his game. Pace: Raheem Sterling put in a lively performance during England's defeat against Italy . Sterling takes defeat personally and was so distraught after the game with Italy that he could not even respond to his mum’s text message. ‘Before the game she told me to relax and not to put too much  pressure on myself, or beat myself up,’ he added. ‘After the game, she dropped me a text and knew I wouldn’t reply until the next day because we lost, but she told me to get over it as quickly as possible. ‘She said I had to make everyone in the country proud, not just my  family.’ He did that with an enterprising and energetic performance in his first full England start. Now the stage is set. Sterling has no inhibitions, playing fearlessly and enjoying the experience of life at a World Cup as an England international. In the hole: Wayne Rooney (left) could play in his favoured No 10 role against Uruguay . ‘I’m young and I’m learning, but I’ve got a lot to learn and I’ve got to grow up,’ he added. ‘I do worry about stuff, but I’m learning every day and have people around me guiding me in the right way,’ he added. On Tuesday his England team-mate Frank Lampard, who has been acting as his chaperone, spoke highly of the young Liverpool forward. Lampard turns 36 on Friday and has seen it all as an international, good and bad, during his distinguished career. Reds: Sterling will come up against his Liverpool team-mate Luis Suarez on Thursday . VIDEO All Star XI: Luis Suarez . ‘Raheem is instinctive, he can think on the pitch at the last  second because of his ability and pace,’ claimed Lampard. ‘Raheem is not the sort of kid walking around now as if he runs the hotel behind the scenes just because he’s been playing well. ‘It is such a goldfish bowl, but he has to live his own life. It sounds like his mother’s very strong with him and that will always help. He won’t want to upset her too much. We all need one of those.’ Lampard was particularly close to his late mother, Pat, and his advice to Sterling on Tuesday was striking. The youngster, to his credit, listened intently. Impressed: England veteran Frank Lampard says Sterling is an instinctive footballer . As he did when captain Steven Gerrard put an arm round him after the red card Sterling received against Ecuador during the build-up game in Miami, for a reckless challenge on Antonio Valencia. That indiscretion is all in the past, Uruguay is all that counts now. England face Suarez and his pals in a game Roy Hodgson simply cannot afford to lose. England’s head coach gambled by shifting Rooney out to the left against the Italians to accommodate Sterling in a central role after his eye- catching performances on the training ground. In charge: Hodgson looks on during a training session at the Urca military base on Monday . ‘The manager thought at the time that playing me in the middle was the best thing to do,’ explained Sterling. ‘But I don’t think the team was built around me. I don’t think he changed anything for me.’ It was a modest response, but this World Cup is made for players like Raheem Sterling.","Raheem Sterling has a tattoo of a young boy staring up at Wembley on his left arm .

"After 19 matches, including winning Olympic gold at London 2012, last year’s title at the Queen’s Club and, of course, Wimbledon, Andy Murray’s glorious streak on grass finally came to an end. We knew it would eventually, but few could have predicted it would be with a whimper. The British No 1 was beaten in straight sets 7-6 6-2 by Radek Stepanek, the 35-year-old ranked No 42 in the world, and beaten well. VIDEO Scroll down for Murray: I blew the first set it's a chance to rest before Wimbledon . Frustration: Andy Murray was dumped out of Queen's in just the third round . Falling apart: After losing the first set on a tie-break, Murray was twice broken in the second by Stepanek . Rocky start: Murray's coach Amelie Mauresmo looks on courtside during Murray's defeat . For once, it was not the deadly mixture of searing summer sun and copious amounts of Pimm’s that kept the well-heeled West London crowd quiet, but the sight of  Murray contriving to beat himself. It was all too much for one ballgirl, who was overcome by fatigue during the lengthy first set tiebreak which Stepanek won 12-10. Murray seemed a little bewildered by events himself, squandering eight set points in that tiebreak and losing his first service game in the second set. Stepanek, a seasoned Davis Cup campaigner, refused to give in to the younger man as his friend,  Chelsea goalkeeper Petr Cech, looked on. Stepanek sealed the tiebreak and then cantered through the second set, breaking Murray twice, to earn a quarter-final tie against Kevin Anderson. Spring in his step: Radek Stepanek celebrates his victory over Murray . The Wimbledon champion, one of the best returners in the game, struggled to pick the Czech’s first serve, on which Stepanek lost only four points, and was pushed back on the court as the veteran seized advantage at the net. There was certainly plenty for Murray’s  new coach, Amelie Mauresmo, to ponder as she scribbled notes. Murray said: ‘​I have only got myself to blame that I lost the first set. Quite a lot of them were on my serve and, on this surface especially, you shouldn’t really be losing sets like that. For me, that’s what’s  disappointing really. I blew the first set and that was my fault. I have played well on the grass over the last few years and my best results came when I had a decent amount of preparation time. ‘It’s more about how I get myself ready for Wimbledon now and hopefully I can do a good job of that.’ Murray’s unbeaten run on grass is over, but there is no cause for despair with Wimbledon just over a week away. The 27-year-old did not play on the clay at Roland Garros last year after pulling out of the French Open with a back injury and practised for 10 days on grass before winning Queen’s and Wimbledon, becoming only the seventh man to achieve the feat. Can't put my finger on it: Murray's fell away after narrowly losing the first set . On the chase: Murray attempts to return a shot to Stepanek during his third round match . This time, he has come into the tournament straight from a French Open semi-final, with only two days to adjust. He looked a little rusty and upright when confronted with the lower bounce on grass and said his hamstrings felt slightly stiff, but Murray is not alone in struggling with the transition. Rafael Nadal was beaten on grass  in Halle, Germany, where Roger Federer needed three sets to edge past Joao Sousa. Novak Djokovic, meanwhile, was last spotted  relaxing at a beach club in Ibiza. Murray went to the gym ‘to do some weights’ immediately after yesterday’s defeat and will not pick up a racket again until he plays mixed doubles in the ‘Rally for Bally’, in memory of Elena Baltacha, at Queen’s on Sunday. Talk it through: Murray tries to regroup during a changeover . Hitting home: Murray faltered badly during the final set . Eye opener: Despite the defeat, Murray still has high hopes to defend his Wimbledon title . He plans to relax, catch up with friends and watch the World Cup in the interim, although he laughed and admitted he will leave the gardening to his girlfriend, Kim Sears. It transpires Murray prefers to play on grass, rather than mow it. ‘I have never mowed a lawn in my life,’ he said. ‘I wouldn’t want to mess it up and it wouldn’t look great if I tried.’ After that will come an exhibition match at the Hurlingham Club in Fulham and then three or four days practising in the relative ‘peace and quiet’ of the All England Club before everything ‘gets quite hectic’ in the last few days before Wimbledon begins. That, you would imagine, could be something of an understatement from the first British man for 77 years to defend the title.

"FIFA needs a 'new breath of fresh air' declared UEFA president Michel Platini as he withdrew his support for FIFA counterpart Sepp Blatter. Football's world governing body has been plagued by negative press in recent weeks, with the revelations about potential corruption in the vote for the Qatar 2022 World Cup proving the most damaging. Blatter, 78, announced at the FIFA Congress in Sao Paulo earlier this week that he would seek re-election for a fifth term despite previously running on the promise of stepping down after this stint. Fresh air: UEFA president Michel Platini (right) will no longer support his FIFA counterpart Sepp Blatter (left) Under pressure: Blatter is seeking a fifth term despite promising he would step down after his fourth . Mandate: Blatter was given the backing by the FIFA Congress in Sao Paulo to stand for another term . He also sparked and an angry reaction in Britain when he claimed that the allegations against the Qatar World Cup bid process were based on 'racism and discrimination', as well as claiming there was a plot to 'destroy FIFA'. But speaking about the Swiss, Platini said: 'I do not support him. I have known him for a long time and I like him but I am not in favour of him having a new term. 'I supported him in 1998 but I do not support him in 2014. And in the future I will not support Mr Blatter. 'I am supporting him no longer, it's finished. 'He knows it, I told him. I think FIFA needs a new breath of fresh air. 'In 2011, he asked for [UEFA's support] and told us that this was his last term.' Platini himself has yet to confirm whether he himself will run in opposition to Blatter at the elections later this year, but when asked he said: 'It is an option. 'But it is not because of Blatter that Michel Platini would stand. And it is not because of Sepp Blatter that Michel Platini would not appear. 'My only concern is what I want to do. I am almost 60 years and I need to know what I want. Under pressure: FIFA has faced criticism over allegations of corruption in the 2022 World Cup bidding process . Corrupt? Qatar won the vote to host the 2022 World Cup but allegations have been made against them . 'I just want to be sure what I want to do. In my life, I wanted to be a footballer, it went well. I was asked to coach, and to be president of the organising committee of the 1998 World Cup, I liked it. 'Then I became a member of the Executive Committee (FIFA). Now I am very happy to be at UEFA. I am loved by national associations. But FIFA is something important.' Platini said he also had to think about the impact on his family if he went for the FIFA presidency. The 58-year-old said: 'It is not just mine but also that of my family, my children. That's a lot of people. 'But choosing between UEFA and FIFA is not choosing between going to hospital or going to prison - the choice is not a negative one. But when I launch, it is to win.' Blatter on the other hand was infuriated by the reception he received from UEFA federation members, including FA chairman Greg Dyke, earlier this week. Dyke had told Blatter at a meeting of UEFA countries on Tuesday his claim that racism was behind World Cup corruption allegations in the British media was 'offensive and totally unacceptable'. Displeasure: FA chairman Greg Dyke was among the voices who withdrew their support for Blatter . Allegations: Mohamed bin Hammam has been accused of arranging payments to be made . Undecided: Platini says must choose his life direction like when he was a player before standing for election . But Blatter then told a news conference after the FIFA Congress in Sao Paulo: 'I have had to accept a number of blows, but what I saw and heard at the UEFA meeting was the most disrespectful thing I have experienced in my entire life, on the football pitch and in my home.' Blatter was given the green light to seek re-election by FIFA delegates yesterday when they decided to remove age limits or restrict the length of a presidency. The UEFA president is just the latest high-profile football man to withdraw their support for Blatter, with Dyke, FA vice-chairman David Gill and the head of the Dutch FA Michael van Praag already confirming they no longer support the Swiss. Blatter reacted angrily to claims in the British media that Mohamed bin Hammam arranged for payments to be made in order to acquire votes for the Qatari bid for the 2022 World Cup, forcing a heated response from Dyke and Gill.","UEFA president Platini says he has told Blatter he will no longer back him .

"A-League side Melbourne Heart have been renamed Melbourne City and will take Spain striker David Villa on loan from sister club New York City for a short spell later this year. The eye-catching coup of landing Villa, Spain's all-time record national team goalscorer, from October to December was announced just minutes after the name change was made public. The newly-rebranded Australian club stated on their website: 'Melbourne City FC can today announce that New York City FC's inaugural player and Spanish World Cup winner David Villa will join the club for a period of the Hyundai A-League 2014-15 season. VIDEO Scroll down to watch David Villa talk about his move to Melbourne . New colours: David Villa, who signed for MLS franchise New York City, will go out on loan to Melbourne City in the A-League at the start of next season . 'Villa, 32, who was unveiled by the Major League Soccer club as its inaugural player on Monday, will play, train and contribute to Melbourne City FC's Hyundai A-League campaign between October and December 2014 prior to the commencement of the MLS season in the United States.' Former Barcelona frontman Villa helped Atletico Madrid win the Spanish Primera Division league title last month, and also played in the Champions League final against Real Madrid, before his move to Major League Soccer was revealed. He features in Spain's World Cup squad, and could face Australia in the Group B clash between the countries on June 23. The renaming of the Melbourne club, founded in 2009, aligns the Australian outfit with sister teams Manchester City and New York City. Unveiling: Villa joined new Major League Soccer franchise New York City this week but will start out on loan at their Australian sister club Melbourne City . Billboard quality: Villa is New York City's first signing, though the team won't join the league until 2015 . That announcement came from Ferran Soriano, chief executive of the clubs' parent company City Football Group, accompanied by a new badge that prominently adds sky blue to its previous red and white colour scheme. An 80 per cent stake in the Melbourne club was acquired by Manchester City's owners, headed by Sheikh Mansour, in January. Villa's acquisition guarantees a high profile for the team, with Soriano saying: 'We are very proud to have David Villa as part of the City family and are thrilled to announce he will play for Melbourne City FC in the Hyundai A-League this season.

'The sports fans of Melbourne can look forward to seeing one of the best players in world football representing their city when David brings his rare talents to AAMI Park later this year.' Villa is looking forward to the short-term move, saying: 'It's very good for me in every sense. From a football point of view it's the opportunity to play in a new league in a different country, and of course it will be ideal for me to get some competitive football in the period before the MLS season gets under way. I'm sure that playing for Melbourne City FC will be a marvellous experience.'","Melbourne Heart have been named Melbourne City  and will take Spain striker on loan .

"The Chicago Department of Aviation said Thursday that at least 450 flights out of O'Hare and 300 flights from Midway were canceled due to weather, with more delayed. The news comes a day after the Federal Aviation Administration said O'Hare airport is still only at 85 percent capacity and Midway at 80 percent after an employee set fire to Chicago's air traffic control center, triggering a shutdown. Southwest says it is cancelled all of its flights from Midway airport after noon Thursday due to incoming storms. Scroll down for video . Delays: A line of passengers at O'Hare on September 26 tries to reschedule flights that were canceled. More delays are now likely as 750 flights out of Chicago were canceled due to weather. 'With an 80 percent coverage of rain forecast for Chicago, these proactive cancellations are aimed at minimizing surprises for our customers,' Southwest spokesperson Dan Landson told CBS. Chicago Mayor Rahm Emmanuel criticized the FAA and wondered how the agency had 'no backup capacity' considering O'Hare is one of the country's busiest airports. 'My first concern is getting O'Hare up and operating at 100 percent,' Emanuel said at a news conference Wednesday according to DNAinfo. 'O'Hare is a central part of our economy, our competitiveness,' he continued. 'Over the weekend, I was on the phone with FAA telling them they have to get this open, up and running.' The FAA contends that in spite of crippled capacity, its controllers still managed more flights on Tuesday at O'Hare International Airport than anywhere else as the airport recovers. Officials say FAA technicians are working around-the-clock to restore telecommunications services at the Chicago En Route Center in Aurora. They say workers already have installed some of the new communications equipment, but still have to lay miles of new cable. Brian Howard, 36, of the Chicago suburb Naperville is accused of setting the fire before attempting to kill himself with a knife.

GOALS: Ruiz 44 . Referee: E Ossis (CHI) 5 . MAN OF THE MATCH: Christian Bolanos . So, with England limping home and Italy and Uruguay left to scrap for Group D survival next week, Jorge Luis Pinto and his remarkable team are through to the knockout phase of a tournament they were supposed to have no hope in with a game to spare. They have been here before. Twenty four years to the day they beat Sweden in Italy to qualify for the last sixteen. That, though, does absolutely nothing to detract from this astonishing achievement. How humiliating for England to have to face them now next week. Roy Hodgson and his players are staring at a hat-trick of defeats and on this evidence it’s entirely possible. At 5.10pm on Friday afternoon London time, FA chairman Greg Dyke was declaring Hodgson’s job safe. Less than half an hour later Fulham’s Bryan Ruiz was scoring Costa Rica’s winning goal here to effectively send England home. Italy were dreadful, worse than England have been in either of their games. To think Hodgson had hoped he could rely on them for rescue. Costa Rica, though, took advantage of Italian lethargy in splendid, energetic fashion. At the end, Pinto and his staff poured on to the field, almost overwhelmed by what they had just seen. A deeply religious group representing a nation of just 5.5m people, this victory goes right to the heart of Costa Rican national identity. This was pure and brilliant sporting theatre but back home it will mean more than that. The underdogs had to survive a little piece of injustice to dig out this victory, too. Just before they scored their goal, they were denied a clear penalty as Joel Campbell – he of Arsenal - profited from Giorgio Chiellini’s slip to dash in to the area where the lumbering Italian brought him down. So close: Mario Balotelli was sprung clear and beat the goalkeeper but his lob bounced wide . Spot of bother: Arsenal's Joel Campbell was denied what looked a blatant penalty when defender Giorgio Chiellini sent him tumbling . Up in arms: Campbell was infuriated by the non-award with the game still goalless . Astonishingly the Chilean referee – a good thirty yards behind the action - waved play on. Costa Rican protests were loud and prolonged and with good reason. Many of the 40,000 crowd howled their derision, too. Pinto’s team didn’t sulk, though. A couple of minutes later Chiellini was all over the place again as he got stuck beneath a Oscar Duarte cross to the far post and Ruiz headed in via the underside of the bar. Queue something approaching hysteria on the Costa Rica bench with coach Pinto pointing to the heavens to indicate justice.  At that stage it already looked a long way back for Italy – such were their labours – and so it proved. Italy made a change at half-time as Antonio Cassano replaced Thiago Motta and the Euro 2012 finalists did go on to dominate possession in the early stages of the second period. They struggled to create clear chances, though. Balotelli was having one of those games when he looked like he had never played before and only a raking drive from Matteo Darmin and a Pirlo free-kick really caused Navas any concern at all. On both occasions the Levante goalkeeper diverted the ball to safety. In truth, Italy never really looked like scoring and their afternoon ended with Balotelli and Lorenzi Insigne arguing after the substitute had ballooned a late half chance over the bar. Grounded: Andrea Pirlo did not inspire Italy as he had done against England . Roar emotion: Daniele De Rossi was fired up during the national anthems but struggled to impact . Afterwards, Pinto said: 'We have played a historic team with wonderful players. 'Our team feels proud and our country feels proud. 'We hope we will win against England because this will be positive for our team and our country.' His team now have five days to prepare for what could be another historic game against England. They will have their hearts set on a clean sweep now. Italy and Uruguay, meanwhile, will wait anxiously. England, for their part, now know that it never does any good to rely on a rival for a favour.","Fulham flop opened scoring with header just before half-time .

"Click here to see our brilliant Match Zone service which includes this heat map from Samuel Eto'o . Mexico’s Oribe Peralta ensured justice was done just as the Brazil World Cup was about to be hit with yet another refereeing scandal. Colombian referee Wilmar Roldan had risked mutiny inside Natal’s Estadio das Dunas by wrongly ruling out two legitimate Mexican goals for offside in the first half, both netted by ex-Spurs forward Giovani dos Santos. So he – and Fifa – would have been mightily relieved when Mexican domination was eventually rewarded after an hour when Cameroon goalkeeper Charles Itandje pushed out a shot by dos Santos into the path of Peralta to grab the rebound. The result leaves Mexico favourites to qualify from Group A alongside Brazil whom they face on Tuesday in Fortaleza and the goal celebration of tracksuited Mexico coach Miguel Herrera – roaring like a lion as heavy rain lashed down around him – became an instant hit on the internet. Long wait: Oribe Peralta (left) gives Mexico the lead in the 61st minute . Ahead: Peralta wheels away in celebration after given Mexico a deserved lead in the Group A clash .

More seriously, the performances of the officials will again be under the microscope following on from the opening game when Brazil were wrongly awarded a match-changing penalty against Croatia when Fred dived following a tussle by Dejan Lovren. If anything, the decisions made by Roldan and his assistants were even worse, if not ultimately costly. And Herrera made his displeasure clear despite his side’s victory. ‘We scored two clear goals in the first half - frankly the refereeing took them away. There was only one team controlling the ball. 'We could have scored more but we go into the next match with three points and very high spirits. The boys gave their souls on the pitch.’ Twenty thousand Mexican fans watched their team dominate a dismal Cameroon side who looked drained by a pre-tournament row over bonus payments that had delayed their arrival in south America. The only thing stopping Mexico and a handsome win in extremely wet conditions were the officials. Strike: The Mexican striker shoots and scores but his goal was disallowed . He's on! Dos Santos was clearly in an onside position as the cross came into the penalty area . Harsh: Mexico's coach Miguel Herrera (right) was right to feel aggrieved with several first half decisions . Hard luck: The Mexico players claim for a handball during a controversial first half . One to forget: Samuel Eto'o missed a glorious chance to give his side the lead in the first half . They ruled out dos Santos’ volley from Hector Herrera’s cross after 11 minutes when he replays showed he was level with two Cameroon defenders. And Herrera rightly went ballistic on the touchline after half-an-hour when Cameroon’s Eric Choupo-Moting inadvertently flicked on a Mexican corner for dos Santos to score from close range – only for the linesman to wrongly identify Choupo-Moting as a Mexican and put his flag up for offside. Even so, Mexico should have been ahead anyway given their possession, and Rafa Marquez and Hector Moreno bizarrely got in each other’s way when left unmarked at a set-piece. In contrast, Cameroon looked a shadow of the team that thrilled the world at Italia 90 with Samuel Eto’o isolated up front. Winner: Herrera reacts to the final whistle as his team defeat Cameroon . Bad call: Dos Santos (right) puts the ball in the net again but the goal was disallowed due to an offside . Beaten: Mexico's second strike of the game was also controversially disallowed by the match official . Mexico were unlucky not to be ahead sooner, but they finally took the lead after a neat strike into an empty net from Oribe Peralta - Click here to find out more from our brilliant Match Zone service . This one counts: Mexico finally took the lead after this strike from Peralta (19) Still singing? Spectators sit under pouring rain as they watch the Group A match . Following the blunder that gave Brazil a winning start in Sao Paulo on Thursday, another decisive refereeing cock-up was the last thing the World Cup needed. So it was to Mexico’s credit they kept going in the second half to get the win despite the earlier poor decisions. Again, dos Santos was heavily involved in the breakthrough goal after an hour. The Villarreal player struck with his left foot and though former Liverpool goalkeeper Charles Itandje showed great reactions to save, Peralta was positioned exactly where a fox-in-the-box should be. Dangerous: Former Arsenal midfielder Alex Song (centre) fouls Dos Santos . Wet: Dos Santos (left) challenges Alex Song in the rain at the Estadio Arena das Dunas . Defeat: The Cameroon players stand dejected after going down 1-0 against Mexico . The best-paid player in Mexican League history with America kept calm to slot home the rebound from eight yards and trigger huge celebrations among the majority of supporters in the stadium. In an instant, Peralta, who scored both goals for Mexico when they beat Brazil to win gold at the 2012 London Olympics, justified Herrera’s decision to start him ahead of Manchester United’s Javier Hernandez. And the coach shouted and waved his arms like a madman to celebrate, his joy instantly going viral around the world. Enough: Match referee Wilmar Roldan has a word with Cameroon's Maxim Choup-Moting . Chance: Hector Moreno (right) reacts after missing a chance as the Cameroon keeper looks on . Cameroon had a late chance to draw level but Benjamin Moukandjo failed to convert a header in injury-time, which would have been the greatest injustice of all. The Africans included Tottenham’s Benoit Assou-Ekotto and ex-Arsenal midfielder Alex Song but rarely looked like troubling Mexico, whose charismatic coach boasted before the tournament that El Tri are genuine World Cup contenders. Time to party: Mexico's players celebrates Peralta's crucial winning goal on Friday . Peralta, who scored both goals for Mexico when they beat Brazil to win gold at the 2012 London Olympics, was picked ahead of Hernandez for exactly that type of penalty-area finishing. The United man had to be content with a late came off the bench but as bare-chested Mexican supporters celebrated in the incessant downpour, there will be a major inquest in the Cameroon ranks. They were abysmal as if money disputes had affected morale. Their only genuine sights of goal in the second half came when Spurs defender Benoit Assou-Ekotto saw his deflected shot flash narrowly wide and Benjamin Moukandjo failed to convert a header in injury-time, but that going in would have been the greatest injustice of all.

"James Milner may be able to laugh at the Twitter account set up to highlight his boringness, but is @boringmilner the most accurate parody account around? The England star joked on Monday that he wished his Foundation's account @JM7Foundation had as many followers as the parody account - around 15,000 compared with more than 250,000 - but aside from that Milner was hardly riveting. So, can you guess which of the below quotes are actually from the Manchester City man in his press conference on Monday and which belong to the parody account? VIDEO Scroll for Milner on England's group matches and his position in the squad . Speaking out: James Milner was centre of attention during Monday's press conference . 1. Against different teams we obviously are going to have to play in different ways and we've got the players to do that. 2. Football injuries happen unfortunately and if it happens it happens. 3. Just asked Lallana if he enjoyed his debut. He said that he did. I said it's good that you enjoyed it. He said yes it is. 4. The weather's been pretty similair to back home in Manchester - pretty wet. All smiles: Milner was in high spirits as he joked about his Twitter parody account . 5. I've just taken my shoes off and realised . I've been wearing one sock inside out all day. I told Gary Cahill and . he said it was really funny. 6. The manager picks the best team he thinks will win the game. 7. When we were 2-0 down I thought we might lose but we scored three times and won 3-2 instead. 8. We had a jog and things and got the legs going in the gym. 9. We have won the Premier League. I am really happy about this! 10. The manager has picked a squad where every base is covered. He's got a lot of different players in there that can do everything. Crunch: Milner tackles Alexander Callens (right) during England's 3-0 win over Peru last week . 11. I sent Yaya a birthday message but he said It's not his birthday. It was so funny, I bet he hasn't stopped laughing. 12. Everybody is giving 100 per cent in training and going into the games everybody wants to have their name on the team-sheet. 13. When I stepped off the plane in Miami I thought it was really warm and I was right because when I checked the temperature it was 27°c. Brothers in arms: Milner is good friends with Manchester and England team-mate Joe Hart . 14. I told Baines I liked his boots. He said Thanks. I said Did you buy them in a sports shop? He nodded. I said I got mine in a sports shop too . 15. All three games are equally as important and we need to concentrate on all of them the same. 16. I just went to text Joe Hart but I accidentally text David Silva instead. It was so funny. Full of running: Milner against Peru . 1 - James Milner . 2 - James Milner . 3 - Boring James Milner . 4 - James Milner . 5 - Boring James Milner . 6 - James Milner . 7- Boring James Milner . 8- James Milner . 9 - Boring James Milner . 10 - James Milner . 11 - Boring James Milner . 12 - James Milner . 13 - Boring James Milner . 14 - Boring James Milner . 15 - James Milner . 16 - Boring James Milner . Q: What was it like at training today in terms of weather conditions? Pretty similar to back home in Manchester really - pretty wet. But there was no change (to our plans). Everything we were going to do on the pitch we did in the gym anyway. Obviously after a long flight most of the session which we were told we were going to do was gym based. We had a jog and things and got the legs going in the gym and it didn't affect us in anyway to be honest. We've done the preparation up to this point the best we can using the methods, and no stone has been left unturned so we are more than ready. Obviously now we are here (in Miami) it is mimicking the conditions that we are going to have out in Brazil so it is the perfect preparations and come that first game I don't think we will be able to be anymore prepared than we are. There's a real professional feel around the squad, everybody knows exactly what is expected of them and, like I said, the preparation has been second to none. We covered every base and the lads are raring to go with two more games to go and it is the perfect lead in in these condition to go over to Brazil. Obviously you want to contribute as much as you can and be in that starting line-up, but the manager picks the team he thinks is the best to win that game and as long as England win the game that's the most important thing and hopefully I can be a part of that. But any team that does well at a World Cup takes a full squad and the players that aren't playing - even if you are injured and still in the squad - still have a massive part to play, and help as much as you can off the field and be part of that dressing room and in training. The manager has picked a squad where every base is covered and he's got all different players in there who can do everything and however the manager wants to set up and play the game he has got the players to do that. There's great versatility there however he wants to set up. Obviously against different teams you obviously need to play in different ways, and I think he has the players to do that. Q: With the latest rush of injuries, how does it affect you as a player knowing the World Cup is not far away but there are a few games left? You can't really worry about injuries at this stage. You go out there and are preparing for a major tournament. Everybody is giving 100 per cent in training and going into the games, everybody wants to have their name on the team-sheet so injuries don't really come into your mindset. The preparation is done, we do all the pre-activation stuff before training and games and the strength work in the gym. Football injuries happen unfortunately and if it happens it happens. But as a squad of players and a group of staff everything is done to reduce the risk of injury. Q: Do you think you need to focus on Uruguay and Costa Rica to go through the group? All three games are equally important and we need to concentrate on them the same. The first one we concentrate on more because we are going to take it a game at a time. Obviously we play more games against European opposition in club and international football so it was more important in the warm-up games to get used to playing against Latin American teams and get that experience. I think the way the games have been set up for us and with the full preparation, it has been a really good build up for us and hopefully we can continue the form we showed in the last game through these next few games and go into that first game (against Italy) with a bit of momentum and confidence.","James Milner is with the England squad in Miami ahead of World Cup .

"Maria Sharapova won her second French Open title on Saturday but it was Romanian Simona Halep who claimed the hearts of the Roland Garros crowd after pushing the 27 year-old Russian to the brink of defeat. Sharapova had to use every grain of her experience and fighting capabilities – plus some highly dubious stalling tactics – to complete a 6-4, 6-7, 6-4 victory that stretched to just over three hours on a steaming afternoon. While lacking much variety it was a fine contest of baseline slugging and retrieving, only marred by the weak officiating of French umpire Kader Nouni, who failed to crack down on the timewasting that continually forced the Romanian to adjust her pace of play.

"Diego Costa took another step closer to confirming his £32million move to Chelsea on Saturday night after claiming 'it looks like' he is set to join Jose Mourinho's side. As Sportsmail revealed on Thursday, everything is in place for the Spain international to move to Stamford Bridge and Costa has spoken out about the transfer for the first time. Speaking after Spain's 2-0 friendly win against El Salvador, Costa told AS: 'Am I going to Chelsea? It looks like it.' Agreed: Diego Costa has revealed his £32m move to Chelsea is likely to happen . Chelsea have already Costa's £32m buyout clause and have become frustrated with Atletico's attempts to delay rubber-stamping the deal. A Chelsea source said: 'Chelsea have made an offer to Atletico Madrid in compliance with the buyout terms in Diego Costa’s contract, and Chelsea have been advised that the player has provided notice to Atletico Madrid invoking the buyout clause and directing the club to accept Chelsea’s offer. 'Chelsea looks forward to entering into formal transfer documentation with Atletico Madrid as soon as possible so that the player can concentrate on the World Cup.' Costa, who missed Spain's friendly against Bolivia on May 30, started for Vicente del Bosque's side on Saturday night and was heavily involved in their last game before the World Cup. Key man: Costa put in an impressive performance during Spain's 2-0 win against El Salvador . The game was less than five minutes old when he got behind the defense to chase down Xabi Alonso's long ball and was taken down by Henry Hernandez near the top of the box. The penalty was given, but Cesc Fabregas failed to take advantage when his spot kick sailed over the crossbar. Costa went on to have several more of his team's scoring chances. None was better than his point-blank header that was somehow saved by the outstretched right hand of the leaping Hernandez in the second half. Comeback: Spain boss Vicente del Bosque (right) praised Costa's performance against El Salvador . The 25-year-old nearly played a part in Villa's first goal in the 60th minute. When Alonso crossed to Sergio Ramos, Hernandez committed himself to the ball and left the net open. Ramos headed the ball back to the middle, and Costa swung his right leg high for a sure-fire strike - but Villa barely got there first and headed it in. Costa was subbed for Xavi Hernandez in the 74th minute. With the leg looking fine, the final step is to get back in full game shape. 'It was good to get rid of the fear I had,' Costa said through an interpreter after the match. 'I am not 100 per cent, but about the injury, it is clear that I am very well, that I am better. So this week I must work hard.'

"AC Milan have opened the door for star striker Mario Balotelli to move to Arsenal after refusing to rule out selling the Italian forward.

The Italians would expect to recoup that fee and more for one of Europe's most sought after young strikers.

"A woman who sustained horrific injuries when she was run over by her pampered dog has been awarded a $143,590 compensation injury payout. The pet lover, who is in her sixties and does not wish to be named, was returning to her car after walking her three much loved dogs in February 2005 when the incident occurred in Colac, a small city in the Western District of Victoria. She had left her keys in the ignition to turn on the air conditioning for her pooches as it was an extremely hot day, before putting two of her dogs in the back seat and one in the front passenger seat. As she went to get into the driver’s seat one of her dogs knocked the hand brake, releasing the car and starting it rolling, while the woman had her arm caught in the door. A woman in her sixties was run over by one of her three pet dogs after it accidentally knocked the hand brake (stock photo shown) She was dragged along with the car until eventually falling to the ground. As she did so the car run over the top of her, causing extensive injuries to her back, neck, shoulders, and left hip. Her claim for lump sum compensation was this week awarded by the Transport Accident Commission. Her lawyer, Ann Cunningham from law firm Stringer Clark, told Daily Mail Australia: 'I really thought ""I've seen it all now"".' 'The hardest thing about this case was the multiple injuries and the time it took waiting for them to stabilise. ‘She had many surgeries, including a hip replacement and a bilateral shoulder replacement,' she added. The strange accident happened in February 2005  in Colac, a small city in the Western District of Victoria . The TAC has offered to pay $143,590 to the woman as a lump sum compensation amount, in addition to the payment of medical expenses and income entitlements. Mrs Cunningham said: ‘Obviously, there was no liable party in this accident, and while it has its humorous dimension, the major injuries caused were no laughing matter for the woman concerned. ‘While this is a highly unusual car accident, it underlines the point that TAC offers nofault compensation payments to help injured people in their rehab and to get on with their lives as best they can. ‘In my experience, people in regional areas are reluctant to pursue their injury entitlements, but it is important to bear in mind that we pay our car registrations and insurance premiums precisely so that we are covered should we suffer serious injury.’","A woman in her sixties was run over by her dog in February 2005 .

PR manager Melanie Hutchinson's view was obstructed by another train, but could hear the child’s mother screaming. 'I could hear screams of real pain, harrowing. I wondered if someone was in labour it was so intense. 'I was looking at the people on the stationary train. Everyone who was there was facing the scene. I don’t think anyone knew what to do or what was going on. 'The tannoy asked for any nurse or doctor to go to platform 5. The train in front never moved so I didn’t see anything. But those screams will haunt me.' Fellow commuter John Reid, 41, from Bromley, south London said : 'I saw the paramedics working like Trojans to try to save the child. I felt so helpless and feel so sorry for those poor parents.' Filmmaker Joe Richardson tweeted: 'Praying for the young child who collapsed at London Bridge and the mother. So surreal.' Passers-by tried to resuscitate the child until paramedics arrived, but he was later pronounced dead at St Thomas' hospital (file picture) A London Ambulance Service spokeswoman said: 'We were called at just before 9.15pm to reports of child in cardiac arrest at London Bridge train station. 'The first of our medics arrived within three minutes of the call coming into our control room. 'CPR was already being carried out by a passer-by on arrival. Medics made every effort to resuscitate the patient both at the scene and on the way to hospital. He was taken as a priority to St Thomas’.' A spokesman for British Transport Police said: 'We were called to London Bridge station shortly after 9pm on Wednesday, 15 October to reports of a child having collapsed. 'Colleagues from London Ambulance Service also attended. The boy, believed to be three years-old, was taken to hospital, where he was pronounced dead. 'The incident is not being treated as suspicious. A file will be prepared for the coroner.'","The boy collapsed and went into cardiac arrest at around 9.15pm yesterday .

"Harriet Harman was mocked last night for calling on David Cameron to let her know every time RAF jets took off to bomb Islamist militants in Iraq. Party sources said the Labour deputy leader made the request at an emergency Shadow Cabinet meeting last week. It had been called to finalise the party’s position before last Friday’s Commons vote authorising military action against IS fanatics. Scroll down for video . Labour deputy leader Harriet Harman was mocked last night for asking David Cameron to let her know every time RAF jets took off to bomb Islamist militants in Iraq . One source said: ‘At the meeting, Harriet surprised everyone by saying that she wanted to be kept informed before each raid by British planes.’ Last night, even her party colleagues were quick to brand the request ‘farcical’. One senior Labour MP said: ‘The idea that someone gives Harriet a ring as our RAF Tornados are given the final order to go into action in Iraq is just bonkers. ‘Once political authority is given for military action, it’s largely down to the military.’ Even Ms Harman's party colleagues have branded her request as 'farcical' Tory MP Colonel Bob Stewart, ex-commander of UN forces in Bosnia, said: ‘The idea of informing politicians not even in the Government when a military operation is about to take place is daft.’ Last night, a source close to Ms Harman said: ‘She was just concerned that everything should be done to ensure that the bombing did not unintentionally kill civilians.’ Party sources also claimed that Labour peer Lord Wood, a key adviser to Ed Miliband, had urged him to persuade the Government to put a time limit on the military action in Iraq. A source said: ‘Stewart wanted Labour to insist on a so-called  “sunset clause” on the bombing but he was overruled.’ The Prime Minister last week told MPs that the battle against the Islamist militants could take ‘not months but years’.","Harriet Harman 'surprised everyone' by making the request of the PM .

"Three Tottenham Hotspur players were dropped by Belgium manager Marc Wilmots as they beat Russia 1-0 at the World Cup to secure qualification for the last-16. Nacer Chadli, Jan Vertonghen and Mousa Dembele were all replaced in the starting line-up as Russia frustrated the Belgians. Chelsea's Eden Hazard and Romelu Lukaku failed to impose themselves on the match and will need to improve if Belgium do hold hopes of going far in this tournament. VIDEO Scroll down for Vincent Kompany: There's a lot of pressure on Lukaku . Crucial: Chelsea midfielder Eden Hazard grabbed the assist for Belgium's winner against Russia . Goal: Divock Origi grabbed the winner for Belgium in their 1-0 victory over Russia with three minutes left . Ecstasy: Belgian players celebrates in front of their fans following Origi's winner against Russia . Happy: Belgium coach Marc Wilmots celebrates after Belgium beat Russia 1-0 to progress at the World Cup . Thibaut Courtois . Every time you see this keeper you cannot help but be impressed. Following a phenomenal season on loan at Atletico Madrid - which bagged him a La Liga title and a Champions League final - Courtois has taken his form into the World Cup in Brazil. This was his 100th career clean sheet and he is only 22. Jose Mourinho and Chelsea, take notice. Courtois commands his box so well and every single cross from the Russian side he was quick to catch and hold. A couple of decent saves from Alexander Kokorin in the first half and another from Maksim Kanunnikov were all he had to do really, but he did it was ease which was impressive. Impressive: Chelsea goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois kept his 100th career clean sheet against Russia . Victory: Courtois claps the Belgium fans as he leaves the field following a composed display in goal . Vincent Kompany . Dominant display. Whenever the Manchester City centre back has the ball at his feet he looks so composed and rarely puts a foot wrong. Was caught out of position just before half-time as Kokorin ghosted in between the centre backs to nod a free header wide, but apart from that he looked extremely assured. If Belgium are to go far in this tournament then they will need him to stay fit and lead from the front. Dominant: Manchester City's Vincent Kompany (left) was composed and in control in defence for Belgium . Captain marvel: Kompany (second left) congratulates goal scorer Origi after he nets Belgium's winner . Jan Vertonghen . One of three Spurs players dropped before the match for Belgium, he soon was back on the pitch following Thomas Vermaelen's injury. He sometimes struggles for pace at full back and was caught out a few times, but overall he is a tidy footballer and is very solid. Comfortable afternoon for him in all honesty as Fabio Capello's Russia offered so little going forward. Substitute: Tottenham's Jan Vertonghen (left) was dropped but came on after 31 minutes . Solid: Vertonghen did his job well at left back once he replaced the injured Vermaelen for Belgium . Thomas Vermaelen . It just has not been his season. Dropped by Arsene Wenger at Arsenal, persistent injury problems curtailed him from being able to force his way back into his club side. He was given his chance here at left-back and had done relatively little wrong before he was forced down the tunnel with an injury after just 31 minutes. He suffered a knee injury during the warm-up and had to come off. Very disappointing for him. Frustrated: Arsenal defender Thomas Vermaelen looks disappointed as he leaves the field injured . Knock: Vermaelen suffered a knee injury in the warm-up and has been plagued by fitness problems . Eden Hazard . Again Hazard really struggled to leave up to the hype in this match - until the final three minutes. Two frustrating performances for the Chelsea man - Dries Mertens has been Belgium's shining light and Hazard has been merely an observer for large parts - but he has provided two assists in two games now. A few decent tricks and flicks but he kept giving the ball away and there was no end product until, with 87 minutes on the clock, he jinked inside two Russian players and laid the ball off for Divock Origi to bag the winner. If he can find form then Belgium could really be strong in the latter stages of this tournament, but Hazard doesn't look entirely comfortable with this formation. Nothing seems to be happening for the little magician at the moment. Tricky: Hazard was frustrated for large parts of the match but came up with an assist late-on . Control: Hqzard only showed glimpses of the quality that he possesses in the match against Russia . Improvement: If Belgium can get the best out of Hazard then they could go far in Brazil . Romelu Lukaku . It really has not been the Chelsea man's tournament has it. He was extremely poor again for Belgium following his anonymous display against Algeria. After failing to register a shot in his first match, or even making a touch in the opposition penalty area, he looked lethargic and did not work hard enough for Wilmots' men against Russia. The ball kept bouncing back from him towards Russian defenders and would not stick to hit feet. He was deservedly replaced for the second match in a row by Lille's 19-year-old forward Origi after 57 minutes, who has offered far more than Lukaku has and bagged Belgium's winner. Is Mourinho being proved right in refusing to give the big man a chance to lead the line at Chelsea? Poor: Chelsea's Romelu Lukaku (left) was again disappointing for Belgium and was replaced on 57 minutes . Off the pace: The ball kept bouncing off Lukaku and he was not able to get himself into the game . Option: Lukaku's replacement Origi (left) netted the winner with three minutes to go . Marouane Fellaini . The Manchester United midfielder was rewarded for his equaliser against Iran with a start against Russia but he did little right, or little wrong. A fairly non-descriptive performance from Fellaini who really did not dominate and use his huge physical presence as well as he should have done. There were a few aerial challenges won and a few neat interchanges with Mertens in the first half but, as Belgium were pushed deeper in the second half, Fellaini offered little threat. Needs to do more. Average: Manchester United midfielder Marouane Fellaini (centre) did little right or wrong for Belgium . Committed: Fellaini competes for the ball with Russia's Dmitry Kombarov during Belgium's 1-0 win . Kevin Mirallas . Replaced Mertens after 75 minutes. Mertens had been Belgium's best player in the first half but faded in the second. Mirallas hit the post with a free-kick with seven minutes remaining, probably Belgium's best chance, and then should have scored in injury time when he was set one-on-one by Eden Hazard but shot straight at the goalkeeper. Had a fantastic season at Everton but struggling to get into this Belgian side at the moment but, given a start, he could prove the difference for them.

"Alastair Cook’s patience with his arch-critic snapped at Headingley on Thursday ahead of the decisive second Test against Sri Lanka when he accused Shane Warne of making personal attacks on him and his England captaincy. The Australian has seemingly had it in for Cook ever since he called his 294 against India at Edgbaston three years ago ‘boring’ but he cranked up his criticism of the England captain this winter and throughout last week’s first Test. And Cook responded to persistent negative comments from Warne on Sky TV and in his newspaper column about his tactics and the timing of his declaration against Sri Lanka at Lord’s by saying ‘something needs to be done.’ Hitting back: Alastair Cook has criticised Australian pundit Shane Warne for 'personal attacks' Outspoken: Sky pundit Warne has been vocal in his criticism of Cook's captaincy in recent months . Tactics: Cook (left) discusses strategy with England coach Peter Moores during training at Headingley . Under pressure: Cook's captaincy came under criticism in the first Test against Sri Lanka at Lord's last week . Nets: England practise at Headingley ahead of the second Test with Sri Lanka which starts on Friday . Cook refused to bite when asked about Warne and other criticism in his press conference ahead of Friday's second Investec Test but was more forthcoming in a radio interview with the BBC’s Jonathan Agnew. ‘Something needs to be done because in my eyes I’ve been criticised for a hell of a lot of my three years as captain,’ said Cook when asked for his response to ‘voluble’ remarks, in particular from Warne. ‘Yes, when you lose as captain you get criticised but I’ve also won a lot for England. I’ve won more one-day games than any other England captain, I’ve won an Ashes and away in India. I’m proud of that, so to be criticised for three years I find quite hard to take to be honest. ‘Support and positivity is what this England team need. The crowd at Lord’s were brilliant, the public there were fantastic and got behind the lads. A bit more support like that would stand everyone in good stead.’ Did Cook believe the criticism was personal? ‘Yes I think it is,’ he said. But would a century in Leeds silence the noises off? ‘It probably wouldn’t which is sad but hopefully for the good of this England side it would.’ There is no question to this observer that Warne, a close friend and confidante of Australian captain Michael Clarke and an ally of Kevin Pietersen, has been harsh and relentless in his attacks on Cook but whether the England captain should have responded in this way at this time is questionable. Up and down: Cook looks frustrated during the first Test (left) but was smiling in training before the second . Friend: Sky TV pundit Warne (left) is close with Australia captain Michael Clarke (right) Strategy: Moores (second left) talks with Liam Plunkett (left) and England's other players during training . VIDEO New look line up impressing so far - Cook . Cook can only stoke up the fire and increase the pressure on himself by responding to Warne and would have been better off ignoring a man who is undoubtedly one of the greatest of all cricketers but to my mind at least is a one-eyed and repetitive commentator. Quite what Cook feels can be done to stop Warne is not clear but he cannot expect to silence or censor a pundit who is paid to give his views. Unfortunately, the deportation of voluble Australians is beyond the power even of an England captain or an ECB chairman in Giles Clarke who complained to Sky about Warne’s attacks on Cook after the disastrous Ashes winter. Other than Warne and perhaps a couple of other observers Cook and the new England have actually received a lot of support from the bulk of the media and there were far more positive assessments of the Lord’s performance by England and the tactics of their captain than negative ones. It is certainly laughable for those who have called on Cook to stand up as an England captain and do the job his way to now say he should be picking the brains of those in the commentary box who would seek to undermine him. Venue: Headingley will host the second Test between England and Sri Lanka which starts on Friday . Hitting out: Plunkett bats in the nets at Headingley ahead of the second Test against Sri Lanka . Catch: Stuart Broad dives to grab the ball as England prepare ahead of the second Test with Sri Lanka . Cool: Ian Bell looks calm as he waits to catch the ball during a nets session at Headingley with England . Cook said yesterday that the man outside of the England set-up who he turns to for advice is former England captain and Sportsmail columnist Nasser Hussain and it is absolutely his prerogative to seek opinions from where he wants to rather than pander to Shane Warne just because he has been a critic of him. ‘Everyone will have different views on how to get results and I’m doing it the way that feels right to me on the pitch,’ said Cook. ‘We keep things in house but I spoke to Nasser the other day not just about captaincy but all sorts of things. He is a good friend of mine and made some good points. 'At the end of the day I feel we did a very good job at Lord’s without quite getting over the line and if we continue to play like that I will be proud as England captain.’ What Cook needs most of all to repel Warne’s near unplayable deliveries is to score his first Test century since he last played here at Headingley against New Zealand just over a year ago. And the England captain knows it. Huddle: England players and coaching staff take time during training to talk through their strategy . Oval ball: England's Joe Root runs with an Aussie rules' ball during training ahead of the second Test . Bowling: England paceman Jimmy Anderson (left) and spinner Moeen Ali (right) during training at Headingley . 'It’s crucial I score runs as captain so I need to get back to getting as many as I can,’ said Cook. ‘I am doing the hard work. I’ve just got to score in the middle. 'I think this run is different to the poor form I had a few years ago because back then I didn’t know where the next run was coming from. The difference now is that I haven’t been converting starts to hundreds and that’s frustrating.’ Sri Lanka want to complete a tour that has seen them win the Twenty20 international and one-day series with a victory that would give them their first Test series win in England. Cook knows they will be tough opponents again but hopes the Headingley pitch will have more pace, bounce and carry than Lord’s. ‘We played really well at Lord’s but that’s gone,’ said Cook. ‘We have to earn the right to again get in the positions we got into there. Eventually we dominated Sri Lanka but it took us four and a half days of really hard work to do so. 'Yes we desperately want to win this Test and to do so we will need to play good cricket.’ And if they do maybe even Shane Warne will be impressed.

Smash: Sri Lanka's Kumar Sangakkara hits a shot during a net session at Headingley ahead of the second Test .

"Honey Boo Boo shared a hotel bed with her sister's childhood molester and Mama June, her uncle has claimed. Lee 'Uncle Poodle' Thompson told the National Enquirer that he saw his nine-year-old niece Honey Boo Boo, whose real name is Alana Thompson, cuddling her mother and Mark McDaniel during a  trip to Cherokee, North Carolina in September. McDaniel, 53, is accused of repeatedly molesting Honey Boo Boo's older sister Anna 'Chickadee' Cardwell, now 20, when she was just eight. McDaniel, then Mama June's boyfriend, served 10 years behind bars and was released in March, and he has been rumored to be seeing the 'Here Comes Honey Boo Boo' matriarch again. 'Targeted': Honey Boo Boo, pictured with her mother Mama June last week, shared a bed in a hotel room in September with the man who molested her older sister, her uncle has claimed . Anger: Lee Thompson, also known as Uncle Poodle, claimed he saw the girl sharing a bed with McDaniel and her mother. He said Mama June spoke in graphic detail about her own sexual relationship with the man . 'I'm disgusted with June for not protecting Alana from Mark,' Uncle Poodle told the Enquirer. 'This guy can't be trusted. He needs to be locked up and have the key thrown away.' He claims that McDaniel traveled with him, his partner, June and Alana to a casino in Cherokee on September 12 for a weekend trip. While there, the five stayed in the same room with two queen-sized beds for the two couples, while Alana slept on the floor, he told the magazine. But when he woke the next morning, he saw that the youngster was in bed with her mother and McDaniel and 'it looked like they were cuddling', he said. Accused: Mark McDaniel served 10 years in prison for child molestation and was released in March . There is no suggestion that anything sexual happened in the hotel room, the Enquirer pointed out, but Uncle Poodle added: 'I wouldn't be surprised if he's targeting Alana.' On the trip, June introduced McDaniel as her 'gay friend' to avoid speculation that she was cheating on her husband, Mike 'Sugar Bear' Thompson, Uncle Poodle said. Sugar Bear - who is Uncle Poodle's brother - thought they were in Atlanta at the time, he said. But June and McDaniel's relationship was obvious to anyone who looked, he added, because they were kissing and hugging the whole time. After sharing a room with the others for the night, McDaniel and June rented their own room for several hours - and when June returned, she bragged they had just had sex. 'She went into graphic detail... and she was doing it right in front of Alana,' he said. Since the scandal emerged two weeks ago - and TLC canceled the show - Uncle Poodle has said he will fight for temporary custody of the young girl if Mama June does not end the relationship with McDaniel. Sources told TMZ that he has researched the ground rules for winning temporary custody, while he said himself and his fiancé are getting a new, larger apartment with a spare bedroom. Snubbed: He added that June's husband, Sugar Bear (pictured), thought they were in Atlanta at the time and that she lied that McDaniel was her gay friend. Sugar Bear and Mama June have since separated . Hurt: Anna 'Chickadee' Cardwell has spoken out about how hurt she feels that her mother is seeing the man who assaulted her when she was a child. Anna told cops in 2003 that he had sexually abused her . The sources say that Uncle Poodle will not ask for permanent custody because he would like to see Sugar Bear eventually care for his daughter when he gets back on his feet financially. Other reports have suggested that Uncle Poodle is trying to get his own reality TV show. At age nine, Alana is a year older than her sister Anna was when she was abused by McDaniel in the trailer he shared with Mama June. Anna told police in 2003 that he abused her for months in 2002  - sometimes while sister Lauryn 'Pumpkin' Shannon, then three, was in the same bed.","Alana 'Honey Boo Boo' Thompson cuddled her mother and Mark McDaniel in bed during a trip to North Carolina in September, her uncle has claimed .

"Ozzy Osbourne has described how he felt excited after the 9/11 terrorist attacks saying it was 'my kind of craziness'. The Black Sabbath frontman was in New York the day two airliners hijacked by militants from al Qaeda crashed into the World Trade Centre's twin towers. The attacks caused the deaths of 2,753 people in what was one of the deadliest attacks on American soil. Scroll down for video . Ozzy Osbourne, who has said the 9/11 terrorist attacks in New York made him feel 'excited' In a new interview, the 65-year-old recalled how he was in the city the day of the terrorist atrocities. He explained that he was standing on the steps of his hotel in the city, describing the scene as, 'f***** weird.' And when asked by Shortlist magazine if he was frightened, he replied: 'I wasn't scared, I was excited! It was my kind of craziness, y'know.' He then went on to describe the usually bustling streets of New York City as like an old cowboy film with newspapers floating around the streets. He added: 'It was so f****** weird. Everybody just backed off Manhattan because they didn't know if it was an all-out thing or what.' However, he also spoke of his concern about the current threat of terrorism saying he hopes that ISIS 'don't get going'. He explained: 'I think sooner or later one of these crazy f****** is going to get a nuclear weapon and f*** a lot of people up.' The singer was in New York the day two airliners hijacked by militants from al Qaeda crashed into the World Trade Centre's twin towers . The singer's comments came after he described meeting former president George W Bush after he was invited to the White House Correspondent's Dinner in 2002 with wife Sharon. He said he had drank three bottles of wine before the dinner and admitted that he 'never quite got' the former US leader. The couple attended the event shortly after their reality TV series starring the couple and children Kelly and Jack began to air. Mrs Osbourne explained at the time: 'We were sitting at our table and George Bush started his speech, thanking 'members of the Press, movie stars, TV stars and Ozzy Osbourne'. 'Then he started talking about how his mother loved Ozzy's music. At this point, Ozzy stood up on his chair and the President was saying, 'Get down, Ozzy.

"FIFA will 'never change' while Sepp Blatter remains president, according to his former ally Jack Warner. Warner quit FIFA in disgrace following a corruption scandal in 2011, after three decades as an executive committee member. The Trinidadian politician has continued to be caught in allegations surrounding payments made by another ex-FIFA member, Qatar's Mohamed Bin Hammam. Hitting out: Jack Warner has slammed his former ally at FIFA Sepp Blatter . Blatter is expected to announce on Wednesday at FIFA's Congress in Sao Paulo that he will stand for a fifth term as president. But Warner, who played a key role in securing Blatter's original election, said it was time he stepped down. Warner told ITV News: 'If Blatter had one modicum of decency he wouldn't even be at FIFA still. 'I have been with FIFA for 30 years... I am still the longest serving elected officer of FIFA, and under Mr Blatter? I am saying to you under Mr Blatter, FIFA will never change.' Meanwhile, on Monday Blatter claimed allegations of corruption surrounding the Qatar 2022 World Cup bid have been steered by 'discrimination and racism'. The Sunday Times published further allegations this week regarding Bin Hammam, claiming it has received 'hundreds of millions' of documents some of which show payments he authorised to football officials during the bidding process for the tournament. However, Blatter told the Confederation of African Football (CAF) Congress in Sao Paulo on Monday that the media reports are a 'storm against FIFA'. Revelations: The Trinidadian reveals all to ITV News in a new TV interview . The Swiss added: 'Sadly there's a great deal of discrimination and racism and this hurts me. It really makes me sad.' African officials were among those alleged to have taken payments from Bin Hammam, according to the Sunday Times. CAF responded by issuing a resolution on its website Monday condemning the claims as 'deliberately hateful, defamatory and degrading'. All smiles: Blatter with disgraced former AFC president Mohamed bin Hammam . Bin Hammam was banned from football for life by FIFA in December 2012 over 'conflicts of interest' while president of the Asian Football Confederation (AFC). FIFA's chief investigator, Michael Garcia, has this week completed his assessment of the bidding process for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups, due to be finished this week - although the findings will not be made public until later this summer.","Sepp Blatter set to stand for a fifth term as FIFA president .

"Sportsmail's columnists Martin Keown and Jamie Redknapp tackle the key questions ahead of England's World Cup opener against Italy. Jamie Redknapp: I hope the players have watched the DVD of the match against Italy in the European Championship in 2012. England’s retention of the ball was appalling. It’s OK having quick players but we must keep the ball and we don’t do it well in our country. This is a game to change that. Martin Keown: It’s easy to stereotype the Italian team as one full of great defenders but I don’t think this lot are up to it. We need to ask them serious questions from the off. Wayne Rooney must get in the pocket to pester Andrea Pirlo and it is becoming increasingly hard to leave out Raheem Sterling. Answer all our prayers: Captain Steven Gerrard will be vital if England are to start with a win . Keown: Steven Gerrard. To play good football you need your best player in the middle and he’s ours. His passing range, defensive responsibility and leadership are invaluable. Redknapp: I am pretty comfortable with the strikers and the midfield options, but our defence worries me. So I am going for Gary Cahill. He needs to play the way that he plays for Chelsea. Redknapp: Mario Balotelli. Everyone says Pirlo but he won’t surprise us. We know what he can do (and he does it brilliantly). Balotelli will look at this England central defensive pairing and think: ‘there is joy in this for me’. He is their box-office player, if he turns up in the right frame of mind. If. Keown: Balotelli. If he’s focused and switched on, we’ve got a problem. He will fancy his chances against us but the centre backs have to match his aggression and make sure they are first to every ball. He is a different animal playing for Italy but he’s mentally unreliable and can be wound up. Key man: Gary Cahill (centre) will be vital if England are to keep Italy out . Keown: England’s philosophy: Play without fear. Redknapp: Possession, pace, penetration. The three Ps. Redknapp: The food. If you’re in the area, get down to Luigi’s in London’s Kings Road for a takeaway for the match. Keown: The Amalfi Coast. A sensational drive, despite my taxi driver’s suicidal driving. Keown: Watching Pirlo humiliate us in 2012 with his passing before capping it with that chipped penalty. Redknapp: England playing them in the Euros and lumping the ball from Joe Hart to Andy Carroll. Humiliation: Andrea Pirlo's Panenka penalty emphasised Italy's dominance of the ball in the Euro 2012 clash . Redknapp: At home, with my family, writing notes for my Sportsmail column. I hope I can write ‘Gerrard is England’s Pirlo’ on Monday morning. Keown: After a long day of travelling, most likely in a hotel bar in Porto Alegre with my BBC commentary team. Redknapp: ‘Keep the ball.’ Keown: ‘Don’t forget to enjoy it.’ Favourites: Martin Keown admired Franco Baresi (left), while Jamie Redknapp liked Giuseppe Giannini (right) Keown: They have had such an outstanding collection of defenders but Franco Baresi was a one-off. His ability on the ball and the way he  marshalled that defence was an inspiration. Redknapp: Giuseppe Giannini, who played 47 times for Italy and 318 times for Roma. I wanted to be him when I was a kid. The Italian press called him ‘The Prince’. Redknapp: 1-1. Cagey and tight and Ross Barkley making a difference, even if he has to wait to come on from the bench. I hope Roy Hodgson will trust him and give him the opportunity. He can be England’s game changer. Keown: 1-1. Italy will score first but we can finish the game strongly. Hopefully our youngsters coming off the bench can give Roy plenty of selection dilemmas for the Uruguay game.","England have to adhere by 3 Ps: pace, possession and penetration .

"It was early evening in Ipanema and a crowd had gathered outside a boisterous bar. Young and yellow-shirted, they stared through the window where a widescreen television was showing Brazil’s opening World Cup match with Croatia. They were drinking beer and dancing their delight at the third Brazilian goal when the police car approached. It was moving slowly, with lights flashing. Two officers sat impassively at the front and behind sat a third man, his face obscured and his arm hanging through the open window. His hand held a large gun, whose muzzle swung in an indolent arc, sweeping the street, the bar and the dancers. As the car rounded the corner, a few youngsters shouted discreet abuse. But the moment passed and soon they returned to the football. Now clearly it would be quite wrong to read too much into a single, disturbing cameo. Having spent five World Cup weeks in the fascist dictatorship of Argentina in 1978, I am aware that Brazil is no totalitarian state. But it is a land beset by savage inequality and social division, where order is frequently preserved by the fear of force, where threats are blatant and menace is meaningful. Armed and dangerous: Riot police stand at the ready during an anti-World Cup protest march on Copacabana beach . Those seething tensions have found a focus in widespread resentment of the £11 billion World Cup investment. The fantasy that such a nation would cheerfully abandon its problems in favour of a month-long samba party has not survived the opening week of this tournament. Yet, for all that, this simple game exerts a powerful hold upon the country’s imagination. From the cradle they are made aware of the part that football played in shaping the nation. And the history is cherished. On the eve of the finals, a stream of pilgrims gathered at the statue of Bellini at the entrance to the Maracana. There, holding high the Jules Rimet trophy, stands the captain of the team of ’58, Brazil’s first world champions. Fathers posed alongside sons, requesting strangers to take their picture. Elderly ladies looked on, remembering those distant days, understanding the significance. Small boys studied the bronze plaques at the base of the figure, each bearing the names of the five world-conquering teams. One or two read some of those names aloud and, fanciful though it sounds, they seemed to relish the familiar resonance. The year of ’58 gave us the likes of Djalma Santos and Garrincha, in ’62 we had Didi and Vava, in ’70 Tostao and Gerson, in ’94 Romario and Ronaldo, in ’02 Ronaldinho and Roberto Carlos. And, of course, Pele. Always Pele, the nonpareil, the spirit of Brazil. It is not so much a list, more a litany. If you wish to understand football’s place in the Brazilian psyche, then the answers will be found in the shadow of Bellini. So if their love for the game is beyond question, then how to explain the recent poll in which 60 per cent of the population asserted that this World Cup was a bad thing for Brazil. Again, the reason lay in the staggering expenditure — £2bn on stadiums, more than £9bn on attendant infrastructure. And which sporting body formulates the swollen demands, lays down the conditions of contract and generally creates the climate in which such grotesque sums change hands? It is, of course, FIFA, that self-serving group of cheats, chancers and rampant rascals, along with the president whose tolerance of the intolerable has done so much to establish the image which his organisation enjoys today. Survival instinct: Sepp Blatter is posed to lead FIFA for a fifth term as president . Say what you will about Sepp Blatter — and so reduced is his reputation that we find ourselves able to say quite a lot — but marvel at his ability to survive for so long. As my favourite columnist once remarked when describing a fictional character: ‘He could not be fishier if he came with a side helping of mushy peas.’ Bribery, corruption, the selling of favours, the fixing of bids; although not personally involved in any of these activities, Blatter reacts to the deeds of the various miscreants with bogus indignation and a brass-necked refusal to recognise squalid reality. In an organisation blessed with even a smidgeon of self-respect, the extraordinary Sunday Times vote-fixing revelations would have  produced carnage on the executive floor and instant extinction for the president. But FIFA is different. Instead, Blatter accuses the British media of ‘racism’ and in doing so he succeeds in sinking below his own shabby standards. His recent actions have reeked of a worrying eccentricity; the crass contradictions, the clumsy jests, the cringe-making dancing. Last week, he came up with a back-of-an-envelope plan to protest a  couple of decisions in every match. This, of course, is  just what football needs: more dissent, more anarchy, More anger. And this from the  most influential individual in the world game. It was genuinely pathetic, a crude attempt at diversion and distraction. Truly, Blatter is the Bad Fairy at this particular party. Now, some insist that the organisation is rotten beyond reform, that it must be swept away and replaced by a new institution with radical ideas about valuing the game more dearly than the money it may generate. Restoring order: Jacques Rogge transformed the IOC . And they may be right, although such a counsel of despair ignores the example of the International Olympic Committee, similarly infested by sharks and charlatans until a Belgian physician called Jacques Rogge restored a rich measure of order, honour and all those qualities which are currently far beyond the reach of FIFA. But that will take time, more time than football can afford. The crisis is here and now. Small wonder that FIFA’s major sponsors such as Sony, adidas, Visa and Coca-Cola have grown increasingly concerned at the danger of tainting their brands by association with this shameless crew. Small wonder, too, that the people of Brazil should be seriously concerned about their government’s collaboration with such a brazen bunch. Over the past few days, these  people have shown themselves to be the most gracefully impressive of hosts. And they take justified pride in the fact that their country has given the game many of its greatest players and most of its greatest occasions. But the price of success has risen beyond reason and, in a land where reality can be cruelly unrewarding, they are questioning the prevailing priorities. It is all a far cry from Bellini and his men of ’58, when Pele began his golden journey and Brazilian football carried the promise of glory — and the price of the World Cup was not plundered from the pockets of the poor. News reaches South America that an old friend of this column is singing a familiar song. You may recall that Ashley Giles, as the acting England cricket coach, was once favoured to land the permanent job. A wretched run of results, a disastrous World Twenty20 tournament and defeat by the Netherlands scuppered his dreams. Giles accepted his fate but, inevitably, Kevin Pietersen detected a plot. ‘Sadly, I think he was just too close to me for the England and Wales Cricket Board’s liking,’ he said. Yet again, it was all about KP. In his world, it’s always about KP. And still he wonders why we decline to take him seriously.","Brazilian government have invested £11billion to host the World Cup .

"David Beckham will go undercover in a 'James Bond-style' advert during Sky Sports' first break of the 2014 World Cup at 9.14 on June 12. The advert, during Brazil's opening match with Mexico in Sao Paulo, sees Beckham vetting various sporting inventions in a secret laboratory. Amongst the quirky technologies Beckham tests but ultimately goes on to reject are remote-controlled drone-cameras swarming over a cricket pitch. The name's Beckham: England legend David Beckham in a new Sky Sports advert . Others include a sensation suit which lets viewers experience the same physical impacts as a professional rugby player, and ‘Sofa Ref’ – X-Factor style voting for refereeing decisions – but everything proposed has a fatal flaw which ultimately results in a thumbs-down from Beckham. Beckham then unveils his final idea - Sky Sports 5. Sky Sports have announced a new channel dedicated to European football including the Champions League, La Liga and European Championship qualifiers. Smart: Beckham introduced Sky's new channel, Sky Sports 5, for European football . Sky Sports 5, which will go alongside Sky's six existing sports channels, will also offer exclusive coverage of the Dutch Eredivisie for the first time. In November, BT Sport announced an exclusive £897million three-year deal to broadcast live Champions League and Europa League matches from 2015, which was seen a huge blow to Sky. But Barney Francis, managing director of Sky Sports, insists the new channel takes their existing coverage to a new level. He said: 'Sky Sports 5 takes our unrivalled live football coverage to the next level offering more European football than ever before.  There’s never been a better time to be a Sky Sports customer and with two years’ free totally unlimited broadband, we offer the ultimate package for sports fans.'

"England physio Gary Lewin was carried off on a stretcher with a dislocated ankle in bizarre circumstances after Daniel Sturridge's equaliser. Lewin, a former member of Arsenal's physio staff, picked up the injury after standing on a water bottle while celebrating England's 37th-minute leveller - and was even carried off on the stretcher usually reserved for his players and will fly back to England. Roy Hodgson's staff jumped off the bench in celebration but Lewin, who will be replaced by Steve Kemp for the remainder of the tournament, immediately fell to the floor and repeatedly banged the ground with his fist. Sore one: Gary Lewin was taken off in the fist half after hurting his ankle in the dugout . Lewin was left in pain after standing on the water bottle in Manaus and needed urgent medical treatment . England manager Roy Hodgson and Italy coach Cesare Prandelli talk while Lewin is treated . The physio was said to be 'gutted' after being stretchered off from the side of the pitch in Manaus on Saturday night . Attention: Lewin injured himself while celebrating Sturridge's equalising goal against Italy . Concern: It was a mystery initially who had gone down after Sturridge's goal in the 2-1 loss to Italy . The 37th minute incident saw Lewin receiving medical treatment from both FIFA officials and players before he was ushered down the tunnel . Lad-up: The physio left the playing area on a stretcher after slipping while celebrating Daniel Sturridge's goal . Lewin was stretchered off after he dislocated his ankle by standing on a water bottle while celebrating . 'That was a very sad moment for us,' England boss Roy Hodgson said. 'In celebrating the goal he jumped up, landed on a water bottle and dislocated his ankle. 'It was very painful. He was taken to hospital. The doctor set it, put it back in at the side of the field, but it's the end of the World Cup for Gary.' Lewin left the field on a stretcher after a short break in play, with the team's Twitter official feed, @england, swiftly confirming the severity of the injury. 'England physio Gary Lewin was injured during celebrations for @england's goal,' the post said. 'He has dislocated his ankle. Get well soon Gary #3Lions' The Football Association later said the 50-year-old Londoner had suffered a fracture and dislocation. An FA spokesperson added: 'We do have another physio with us - Steve Kemp.' With little known about the protocol for injured medical staff, given the rarity of the situation, Lewin was quickly surrounded by a crowd of around a dozen staff from both sides and FIFA. Lewin was first team physio at Arsenal for 22 years and became an England physio in 1996 alongside his job at the North London club. But in 2008 he quit the Gunners to become Head of Physiotherapy for the national side. In 2007, Lewin was credited with possibly saving John Terry's life in the League Cup Final after the Chelsea captain swallowed his tounge and Lewin, then Arsenal physio, was first off the bench to assist him. During his time at Arsenal he was also credited with saving striker Eduardo's career after he suffered a horror leg break. Hodgson’s staff haven’t had much luck with injuries recently – assistant manager Ray Lewington is on crutches after emergency knee surgery 24 hours before the team’s final friendly against Honduras. England manager Roy Hodgson confirmed Lewin (pictured at the airport ready to fly home) had suffered a fractured and dislocated ankle. He said: 'It is the end of the World Cup for him I'm afraid' On the mend: Lewin was put in a wheelchair after having his ankle tended to .

"Opening the curtains in the bedroom last week, I let out a loud groan. Gone was my manicured grass, an acre of which had stretched down to the woods beyond our house in Somerset. In its place? A sea of churned-up turf. The ornamental vases and topiary which had highlighted the lawn’s lush green were surrounded by huge heaps of earth. While horrified by the sight that confronted me, I was far from baffled. For I knew exactly who the culprit was — our midnight gardener, Brock the badger, named after the Beatrix Potter character, digging in search of worms. Scroll down for video . With the soil now softening up after a rain-drenched first half to October, the worms have become more easily obtainable, attracting badgers to our gardens . For the past three autumns he and his family (I confess I struggle to tell their little black-and-white faces apart) have made their home in the woods near our house — and also made our lives a misery. In summer and winter they leave us alone and undisturbed, but every autumn they come scurrying across and tear up our lawn. And this year it’s not just my area of England that is being ravaged by these hungry lawn-destroyers. The unusually warm September meant that badgers were unable to dig through the dry soil to reach those juicy worms on which they feast. With the soil now softening up after a rain-drenched first half to October, the worms have become more easily obtainable. That, coupled with an abundance of autumnal insect larvae, means it’s ‘grub up’ time — and lawns such as mine are the dinner table. With a UK population of well over 800,000 badgers, this seasonal onslaught will be happening nationwide. And whereas boasting of a ‘badger problem’ used to be a badge of honour among the middle classes — a sign you had a large garden in the country — now they are digging up gardens of all shapes and sizes. As urban areas continue to expand and sprawling housing developments encroach on badger territories, which can run to several acres, more people are finding themselves reluctant members of the badger set. In summer and winter they leave us alone and undisturbed, but every autumn they come scurrying across and tear up our lawn . This is no comfort to keen gardeners who take pride in a well-tended sward, though. To them, the badger is a pest. As for me, despite his night-time mauraudings, I confess I am strangely fond of our badger — or meles meles to give him his scientific name. My wife Maxeen has never quite forgiven me for once missing our wedding anniversary evening because I was so entranced watching a badger sett in the garden. My fondness for the creatures goes back to my schooldays in Bournemouth in the late Sixties, when I discovered a badger sett only a ten-minute cycle ride from where we lived. Many an evening I’d shoot off down the lane to where the sett was — at the bottom of a bungalow’s garden, on a bank, half-hidden in a thicket of holly. It was there that I met my first badger. It suddenly filled the sett’s darkening entrance with a blur of black and white, standing motionless, listening. Then he quietly slipped out and sniffed the air, paw raised. A smaller, slimmer badger appeared behind him. A sow. His mate. They touched noses and purred. Then the sow rolled over and, with both front paws, gave her belly a hearty scratch, lips curled back in a blissful grin. It was strangely human and utterly enchanting to watch. So much like ourselves, waking, stretching and scratching as we embrace a new day — or night, in the badgers’ case. They are noctural creatures, after all. The UK has a population of well over 800,000 badgers . Many decades later, I try to remind myself of those fond memories as I set to work each morning with a trowel, on my knees, shuffling back and forth across my dewy lawn, rolling back each uprooted sod and uttering that same word out loud (with a rather different meaning) to vent my displeasure at the culprit. Many of the holes I fill are round or elliptical. These are snuffle-holes, where the badger had pushed his snout down into the ground so he could suck up a juicy worm without breaking it in two. Worms make up half of a badger’s diet. He will seek out insect larvae as well — cockchafers and leatherjackets in particular — in the roots of the grass, which is deftly pulled up and rolled back using his razor-sharp claws. He is also partial to slugs and snails, and will take on small mammals such as rats, mice, rabbits and hedgehogs if available. But worms are his staple. With each sod thumped back into place I remember a similar thud when I was 18 — the noise of my head hitting the bank after I fell out of a tree during another night-time badger-watching expedition. That thud left me with a broken neck, which healed only after I had lain immobilised on my back for six weeks, not permitted to move. I still get the occasional twinge. So it was with mingled pleasure and annoyance that I greeted Brock into my garden three years ago — and every year since. Nostalgia quickly turned to annoyance as he settled in, clearly identifying my lawn as a great snacking spot. Night after night I leapt out of bed earlier and earlier, dragging back the curtains to be confronted by yet another ravaging of the lawn. ‘Well, do something to deter him,’ growled my wife, retreating under the duvet while I stomped out to don my wellingtons as the sun rose. A Google search produced some possibilities — but with a warning. Badgers are protected under the Protection of Badgers Act 1992 and neither the animal or its sett can be interfered with except in special circumstances requiring a licence. In the case of gardens, this has to be issued by the Government’s agricultural department, which in England is Defra. I toyed with several options but in the end it was something of my own doing that proved to be most successful. It was entirely legal and Brock found it very off-putting. Knowing how badgers have a highly developed sense of smell and mark their territory with urine and badger musk, I reasoned that if I marked mine in similar fashion, such a strong human scent should put him off. There is no chemical that can legally be used as a badger deterrent. Using one means you are at risk of committing an offence under pesticide regulations or wildlife protection laws . So one evening I peed into a used disinfectant sprayer and sneaked out last thing to scurry round the lawn, pumping the sprayer furiously — pssss, pssss. Opening the curtains the next morning, I found that the lawn was untouched. I smiled when I thought of Brock tutting at my antisocial night-time activities for once. Will I be able to keep up my anti-badger campaign? I’m not sure how much longer I’ll be able to keep it secret, but I guess at least there is a continual, ready supply of the repellent. And this, my fellow gardeners, is my gift to you. Happy spraying. From chopped chillies to strobe lighting, the ways to fight back . CHEMICAL WARFARE . There is no chemical that can legally be used as a badger deterrent. Using one means you are at risk of committing an offence under pesticide regulations or wildlife protection laws. Some years back I discovered a rusty old tin of a badger deterrent called Renardine — now banned — left by the previous owners of our house. At the time we’d had a few badger incursions, so I gave it a go. It meant painting a vile-smelling liquid on string strung across the lawn. It drove the badgers away but almost drove us out, too. The smell pervaded every corner of our property and neighbours phoned to ask if we had a leaking septic tank. Soaking strips of cloth in Citronella or Olbas Oil and draping them across the lawn may make Brock take one sniff and move on, but it needs to be done at dusk and repeated daily. CHILLIES . Sprinkling finely chopped red chilli peppers around can be effective if your lawn isn’t too large. I tried it, stripping a supermarket of its stock and raising the eyebrows of the cashier at the checkout. ‘For the badgers,’ I said. I was given a sad look. My look was even sadder later when, having strewn mashed peppers across the lawn, I stood back and, without thinking, rubbed my left eye. ELECTRONIC GADGETS . A variety of ultrasonic alarms are available online and in some DIY stores which emit a high-pitched sound, not heard by humans, when they are triggered by the movement of an animal. One, called Pest Reach, from Coopers of Stortford, also incorporates built-in strobe LED lights, so for less than £30 you can have your garden lit up and unheard alarm bells ring as soon as Brock puts a pad on to your lawn. These devices do seem to deter cats and may be effective against badgers, especially to start with. However, Brock is likely to get used to them, or put up with them if he’s hungry enough. CHANGE THINGS AROUND . Badgers are very cautious, so they can be deterred by unusual objects or changes. A security light coming on can be effective. A scarecrow in a rustling mac could also work but might need repositioning daily. Reflective strips of plastic, wind chimes and toy windmills could make Brock think twice, too. There is a theory that the vibrations from windmills drive grubs deeper into the lawn, making them less accessible — but I think Brock will just dig deeper to get to them. INTRODUCE OBSTACLES . Being creatures of habit, badgers like sticking to their traditional pathways. Weld mesh — steel wire grids available from builders’ merchants — can be tried to plug holes in fences, with more of it laid flat to stop Brock digging under them. One friend used a large boulder that he and his mate heaved with great difficulty across a badger run. The next day he found it rolled aside. Badgers are strong. Electric fencing could protect a defined area, but may require a licence and can be costly.","October rain has softened the soil giving badgers better access to worms .

"Cast your mind back to June 27, 2010, the day England’s last World Cup adventure ended with that horribly familiar sense of crashing disappointment. There had been little excitement in three group games against the United States, Algeria and Slovenia before the last 16 match ended up being memorable for two things – Frank Lampard being ludicrously denied a goal and Germany inflicting England’s heaviest defeat at a World Cup finals. When England suffer a major setback, like that 4-1 dismantling in Bloemfontein, it impacts on the mood of the country. I was a member of Fabio Capello’s squad and we flew home from South Africa knowing, once again, the England team had let the nation down. Crashing disappointment: Wayne Rooney reflects after the humiliating defeat by Germany . What a letdown: Jamie Carragher (right) was part of that England squad and admits they were poor . Big tournaments are a feast for football fanatics yet they also attract viewers who don’t tend to follow the national sport from week to week but are desperate for England to do well. Top class sport brings people together – success makes you feel good and lifts the atmosphere. Think about it: we have been frequently treated during the past four years and, in the future, we may well look back at this period as being the best, most successful we have known in British sport. Just consider all the achievements. Andy Murray has won Wimbledon and the US Open. Sir Bradley Wiggins and Chris Froome have each won the Tour de France. The British & Irish Lions were magical when winning in Australia 12 months ago, England’s cricketers, among other things, won the Ashes and the World Twenty20. Carl Froch has put himself up with the finest boxers we have produced. Golfers Graeme McDowell, Rory McIlroy and Justin Rose have won the US Open – one of them could repeat the feat this Sunday – and all three played their part in Europe’s extraordinary Ryder Cup victory in 2012. All smiles: there is much more positivity around Rooney and the England camp this time around . That is without mentioning the wonderful show we put on for the world with the London Olympics, with the high point being that famous Saturday night when we all sat around our televisions screaming Mo Farah, Jessica Ennis and Greg Rutherford on to gold medals. I wouldn’t say for a moment that I tune into the above sports all the time. I don’t. I wouldn’t have a great interest in rugby union, for instance, but I was intoxicated by the Lions and I can’t wait for the World Cup next year. I love the drama of the big events and seeing British sportsmen succeeding. So now the onus falls on the footballers to get the country bouncing. England may have travelled to Brazil with expectations being talked down but come Saturday night in Manaus, when the first ball is kicked and Group D gets underway, millions will be allowing themselves to dream. After all, it has been too long since there was a buzz about England in a major tournament. You could argue there was when Wayne Rooney emerged at Euro 2004 or when Michael Owen exploded during France 1998 but I’d say Euro 96 was the last time the country came alive because of football. Inspiration: Jessica Ennis (left) and Mo Farah showed in 2012 that British sportspeople can succeed . Defying history: Andy Murray became the first Briton to win the Wimbledon men's singles title in in 77 years . Sky's the limit: Sir Bradley Wiggins (left) won the Tour de France in 2012 and Chris Froome followed in 2013 . Carrying the hopes: George North's memorable tackle on Israel Folau epitomised the detemination of the successful British & Irish Lions Down Under last year . We have underperformed for too long when you consider the amount of top class players who have been available. I’m not singling anyone out but we all – myself included – could have done better in tournaments in Japan, Portugal, Germany and South Africa. But there was negativity about the England squad before a ball had even been kicked at the last two World Cups. In 2006, there was the furore of Sven Goran Eriksson of selecting Theo Walcott, then an uncapped 17-year-old who had not made his Arsenal debut, and headlines about WAGs. Great Britons: Rooney and Co should take inspiration from the likes of Carl Froch (L) and Greg Rutherford (R) Happy days: Alastair Cook and Graeme Swann brought joy to the nation when they celebrated Ashes glory over Australia in 2009 . Silver lining: Justin Rose became the first Englishman in 43 years to win the US Open when he triumphed at Merion last year . Four years ago, things had gone the other way with Capello being criticised for getting too many thirty-somethings in at the last minute – I was one, Paul Scholes might have been another. There was also scepticism about the ‘military’ set up that had been chosen for our base in Sun City. Using that as a reason for why England failed, however, is just an excuse. Quite simply, we were not good enough. Halcyon days: Euro 96, which included this famous Paul Gascoigne goal celebration, was the last time England cam alive because of football . Will England be good enough to go all the way in Brazil? I don’t expect them to. Privately, I’m sure Roy Hodgson, his staff and players will feel the same but the World Cup can still be a success even if England do not contest the final next month. The biggest thing Roy and the team can do is excite us; to get us hugging strangers in the pub and dancing around our living rooms because England have played with style and won the contests that matter. Hodgson’s reputation is not for being bold but as a nation we are willing him to be brave. Let this be a tournament that features England moments we remember for the right reasons, like the 3-0 win over Poland in 1986 when Gary Lineker scored, David Platt’s volley against Belgium at Italia 90 and the thumping, Paul Gascoigne-inspired 2-0 win over Scotland at Euro 96. Thrill them: England need to get fans like the Rogers family from Leicester dancing around their living rooms . There is genuine hope with the squad Hodgson has selected England won’t end up dead on their feet in the knockout stages, hanging on for a draw and losing on penalties as was the case against Italy in the quarter-finals of Euro 2012. Raheem Sterling, Jordan Henderson, Ross Barkley, Adam Lallana and Luke Shaw are all young players with technique but they can also run and their legs will be vital. Hopefully one or two of them – maybe Sterling and Barkley – will make a difference and get England off to a flying start in Manaus. Should the worst happen and England fail to get out of their group, there will be more inquests and more negativity but youth gives hope for the future. If they take their chance, who knows where they will be in two years. The first objective, though, is to get the nation believing again.","England players felt like they'd let the nation down after Germany defeat .

O'Loughlin's youngest daughter Mary couldn't find her and knew something was wrong, so she set out to track her mother down. 'I had gone missing and she just went to the hotel and asked for me and they said, ""No, she's not here"",' O'Loughlin told the ABC. Scroll down for video . Comedian Fiona O'Loughlin, 50, says her daughter Mary saved her from suicide . O'Loughlin opens up about her battle with alcoholism and depression on Australian Story . 'Mary just knew in her heart that I was there and she would not leave. 'She described what I looked like and sure enough I was there.' The 50-year-old mother of five was battling depression and a severe dependence on alcohol and she believes her daughter's actions saved her life. Now over one year sober, O'Loughlin will share her story of depression, alcoholism and recovery on tonight's episode of Australian Story. In her signature self-deprecating manner, O'Laughlin speaks frankly about suicide, her marriage breakdown and the effect her alcohol problem has had on her children. O'Loughlin was a housewife living in Alice Springs when she decided she wanted to become a stand-up comedian at the age of 36. O'Loughlin was a housewife living in Alice Springs when she decided she wanted to become a stand-up comedian at the age of 36 . The stand-up comedian could not perform without drinking two small bottles of vodka before going on stage . By her late 30s she had built up a successful international career as a stand-up comic, but in that time she had also developed a deep dependence on alcohol. 'What when wrong was at the very, very beginning my career never ever going on stage without some Dutch courage,' she told the ABC. 'It used to be a double shot, but you're doing a festival for a month and a double shot doesn't cut it anymore, and then festivals back to back...' O'Loughlin says her new career accelerated her descent into alcoholism. 'I think possibly I would have become an alcoholic anyway, I certainly can't blame stand up, but I certainly think I fast-tracked myself,' she said. In 2009 O'Loughlin's hidden problem became very public when she passed out on stage in front of 450 people at a show in Brisbane. She is pictured here in 2010 . Before going on stage O'Loughlin needed to drink two small bottles of vodka. She even stopped drinking socially, but could not shake the need to get drunk before a performance. 'The problem was for me that I still had this utter belief for such a long time… Until a year ago I still believed that I needed a double vodka before I went on,' she said. The 50-year-old  started receiving treatment from a psychiatrist last year and has been sober for 14 months . 'And I used to hide these bloody little vodka bottles, and it's kind of an OCD thing too, I had to have them. 'I'd hide them in my bras, isn't that crazy, and I knew it was crazy.' But in 2009 her hidden problem became very public when she passed out on stage in front of 450 people at a show in Brisbane. 'And as much as I laughed that off with my colleagues, you know very Judy Garland of me, that's shocking.' Last year, after the incident with her daughter in a hotel room, she started receiving treatment from a psychiatrist and the Albert Road Clinic in Melbourne. O'Loughlin says the support from her five children has been 'amazing' but she knows her alcoholism has taken its toll on them. 'It's been something we've all gone through together, and they cheer me on and they're so beautiful,' she said. 'I said to one of them ""You're going to get really angry about this at some point"", she's 17 and your mother frightened you for about five years of your teenage years.' But O'Loughlin says making it to the one-year sobriety milestone in August this year was 'beyond thrilling'. 'When I got to a year it was just so exciting because now I understand my audience is so much safer,' she said. 'I go out of my way never to have a drink before a show like I've never done before. 'This past year's just been the joy of joys because you're suddenly so in control and having that universe let me know that I wasn't a fake.'

"What happens when you put players as skilled as Gareth Bale, Zinedine Zidane and Lucas Moura together in David Beckham's house? A trophy cabinet gets broken. The four footballers, brought together by adidas for the 'all in or nothing' campaign, were filmed by esteemed Brazilian director Fernando Meirelles, best known for hit film City of God. Quick game? Bale and Moura play each other at FIFA 14 on the Sony Playstation . The clip begins with Lucas sniggering as he and Bale take each other on in a video game as Beckham and Zidane look on. Seemingly bored of not being involved, Becks kicks the ball at Lucas before challenging the Brazil international to play for real. The foursome swiftly jump to their feet, slide the furniture away and play commences. Zidane races across the sofa to latch onto Bale's chip but volleys the ball right toward's David Beckham's precious trophy cabinet which smashes to the ground. Kick ups: Beckham and Moura play keep up with each other in the front room . Mind that cabinet! Bale attempts to control the ball . The former Real Madrid and Manchester United midfielder can't believe it and asks 'What's happened?' '22 years of hard work. Guys this is not good,' says Becks. However, the 39-year-old isn't down for long, quickly spinning on the ball and getting the kickabout going again! Becks give Lucas the eyes before nutmegging him to give the ball to his former Madrid team-mate 'Zizou'. Clearly not deterred by breaking his . friend's trophy cabinet, Zidane then thumps the ball at a large black . chandelier which crashes to the ground. Dribbler: Beckham rounds the Brazilian in the hallway . All smiles: Bale has a laugh with the film crew backstage . 'Football . stars are so used to being filmed that they've almost become actors.

"There was more than one occasion watching England’s 2-2 draw against Ecuador on Wednesday night when I had to blink twice and make sure it was Ross Barkley not Paul Gascoigne who was pulling the strings. Not since Gascoigne has an England midfield player performed with such panache, vision, skill and bare-faced cheek as Barkley showed in Miami. There were dribbles, step overs, nutmegs, probing passes and a goal threat – the sorts of things that not only take opponents out of the game and open them up but also make them fearful. Running the show: The way Ross Barkley beat players against Ecuador was reminiscent of Paul Gascoigne in Italia 90 (below) Gazza had all those attributes and that is why he is still revered by a generation, especially for how he transformed England at the 1990 World Cup. But now at last there seems to be a genuine heir, in football terms at least. The manner in which Barkley set up Rickie Lambert for England’s second goal in Miami was straight out of Gazza’s mercurial manual. The big question is will Roy Hodgson have the balls to unleash Barkley at Brazil 14 as Bobby Robson did Gascoigne at Italia 90? Judging by Hodgson’s comments in the wake of Wednesday’s game he is not ready to take the ‘gamble’. Yet in many ways his reluctance echoed that of Robson ahead of Italia 90, so perhaps  he is bluffing. Hodgson has described constant questions about Barkley as an obsession. Robson felt the same way when the press corps kept banging on about Gascoigne. Taking them on: Barkley was willing to run at Ecuador in Miami and his positivity led to England's second goal . Bank on Barkley: Roy Hodgson has said it'd be a 'gamble' to play the Everton star but he must start . Of Barkley’s exciting display in . Miami, Hodgson said: ‘He lost the ball an awful lot of times as well. If . he’s going to be the player we want him to be he has to make better . decisions of when he turns with the ball.’ It is what Robson kept saying about Gazza in the build up to Italia 90. Indeed it should be remembered that Gascoigne, 23 by the start of that tournament, was as much an international rookie as 20-year-old Barkley is now. Gascoigne had played bit-parts in the qualifiers and it was only in a friendly match against Czechoslovakia in late April that he pushed himself into the frame when he scored one and made three in a 4-2 win at Wembley. Even then, Robson harboured doubts but when it came to the crunch he went with Gazza’s maverick style rather than the more ‘reliable’ Neil Webb and Steve McMahon. Galvanising Gazza: The England midfielder holds off Andreas Brehme in the 1990 World Cup semi-final . Dutch of class: Gascoigne skips away from Ronald Koeman and his penchant for the unexpected scared Holland . Maverick style: Gascoigne jinks through the Cameroon defence during the Italia 90 quarter-final . After a dour opening draw against . Ireland, England came alive in another draw against Holland where . Gascoigne’s lust for the game and penchant for the unexpected offered . England a new dimension. For once a Dutch team playing England looked scared of an opponent who could out play them. Galvanised by Gazza, England went on to produce some of their best football at a major tournament until losing to West Germany on penalties in the semi-final. Given the system Hodgson plays, there is actually more margin for ‘error’ by putting Barkley in the team especially if he replaces the jaded and over-hyped Wayne Rooney. Also Barkley’s personality is less erratic than Gascoigne’s, as is his discipline. Decisions: Roy Hodgson is facing the same quandary over Barkley as Bobby Robson (right) did over Gascoigne . The game breakers - players who have the skill and bravery to take on opponents in the tightest positions - are liable to lose the ball as Barkley did against Ecuador.  It sometimes even still happens to Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo. But these are the players who raise teams to a different level and put a smile on the face of supporters. Gascoigne did that for England in 1990 and Barkley can do that this summer. So what if England can’t win the World Cup? Hodgson, as Robson did, should at least give it a try.","Barkley is an international novice, as Gascoigne was in 1990 .

"The sight of Laura Robson on media duty with her wrist in a cast was a reminder of how tricky such injuries can be as Novak Djokovic pulled out of his favourite Wimbledon warm-up citing problems in the same area. The exact extent of the world No 1’s discomfort remains unclear, but he withdrew from the Boodles tournament at Stoke Park as ‘a precaution’. With Wimbledon starting on Monday, it means last year’s beaten finalist will open his campaign having not had any kind of preparatory match on grass after making the final of the French Open. VIDEO Djokovic pulls out of Boodles . Worry: World number two Novak Djokovic was forced to withdraw in Stoke Park with a wrist injury . Fully fit: Andy Murray meanwhile beat Tommy Robredo at the BNP Paribas Tennis Classic in Fulham . The crowd at the Boodles event were told Djokovic had pulled out as ‘a precautionary measure ahead of Wimbledon next week’. Djokovic (below) withdrew from the Madrid Open in early May due to soreness in his wrist and had a heavy schedule in playing three of the four weeks on clay after that. While there is no suggestion he will have the same issues as Robson, the Stoke Park event has become an established part of his Wimbledon routine, so the decision to skip it is unlikely to have been haphazard. Andy Murray will be pleased to have no such concerns and after last week’s third-round exit at Queen’s, he yesterday got in a useful exhibition match at the BNP Paribas Classic at the Hurlingham Club in Fulham. The Wimbledon champion, with Amelie Mauresmo watching, defeated Spain’s Tommy Robredo 6-2, 7-6 and looked sharp overall, although he had to save five second-set points. ‘I feel good, my body feels better this year. It’s great to get a match and the court was very good,’ he said. ‘There was some high quality tennis. Tommy is a great guy to play because he has great intensity.’ Precaution: Djokovic's wrist injury is not believed to be serious but it has dented his Wimbledon preparation . Champion: Murray looked in top condition to defend his Wimbledon title with a 6-2, 7-6 win . Murray will learn of his prospective path back to what would be a third straight final when the draw is made this morning, although the one thing he knows is that he will open proceedings on Centre Court at 1pm on Monday. ‘A lot of players have spoken about it and how much of a  privilege it is,’ he said. ‘I’m sure there will be nerves and  pressure but I am going to try to enjoy it.’ Robson was an interested onlooker, knowing that her only contribution at  Wimbledon will be working on the BBC coverage. Having undergone an operation on her left wrist in April she has ruled out playing until October and has her eye on a lower tier circuit event in Barnstaple for a possible return. To try and speed recovery she has turned vegan and said that seeing some of her peers make major strides in her absence, such as Garbine Muguruza and Eugenie Bouchard, will spur her on. ‘It is a bit depressing because everybody is out there enjoying themselves, hitting the ball hard and competing,’ she said. Watching on: Murray's new coach Amelie Mauresmo attended as he beat Robredo in straight sets . ‘But in a way it motivates you. I have something to look forward to and can work hard because I know what I want to be doing at the end of it.’ Robson conceded she had tried to come back too quickly, hindered by getting so many different diagnoses. ‘It seems amazing that you can see seven surgeons who all say different things,’ she said. It resulted in feeling helpless at times: ‘I think a low moment for anybody coming out of surgery is when the nurse has to put your clothes on for you, or being unable to cut a piece of meat, although now I’m vegan that doesn’t matter.’ When she does come back it could almost seem like an entirely new career: ‘I’ve got four to five years of experience behind me, so that is going to help, but I’m going to have virtually no ranking.’ Rush: Laura Robson believes she came back too soon from her wrist injury but has learned from her mistake .","Djokovic pulled out of Stoke Park tournament citing a wrist injury .

"Cameroon captain and record goal scorer Samuel Eto'o could be used as a substitute during the second Group A game against Croatia on Wednesday despite a knee injury, coach Volker Finke said. Eto'o, 33, said on Monday he had virtually no hope of appearing in the game, with Cameroon needing at least a point to avoid a group stage exit. The Indomitable Lions lost their opener 1-0 against Mexico, when Eto'o came on as a substitute but felt a recurrence of a niggling knee injury he has been battling for the last few months. Scroll down for videos... Gamble: Samuel Eto'o could be used as Cameroon chase points against Croatia in Group A . Knee-sy does it: Samuel Eto'o is seen with his knee heavily strapped during Cameroon's training session in Manaus . VIDEO Team Profile: Cameroon . 'I think the most important thing for us tomorrow is that Samuel is with us, perhaps as a substitute,"" Finke told a news conference on Tuesday. 'I think it would be very very hard for him to start because we're dealing with health matters here and we can't work miracles,' he said. Eto'o, who has scored 54 goals for Cameroon, said he had not had the time needed over the last few months to fully recover. 'Even if I knew I'd be playing or not I wouldn't say anything ... we can't reveal our strengths and weaknesses to our opponents,' he said. Cameroon did not perform particularly well against Mexico and were disheartened by the loss, Finke said. Make or break: Cameroon are desperate for points after losing their opening game 1-0 to Mexico . To the wire? Cameroon coach Volker Finke insists they can still qualify even if they draw with Croatia . 'Our spirits were low, that's normal, because a defeat like that hurts. We didn't play well in the first half, we were a little bit better in the second half but we missed some chances ... but I think the players can hope for improvement,' he said. Even though Mexico and Brazil already have four points, Finke said qualification was still a possibility for Cameroon and Croatia if they drew on Wednesday. 'No one can sleep because everything remains open ... if the match tomorrow is a draw, the last games will be really crazy,' he said.","Samuel Eto'o could play some part in World Cup game against Croatia .

"Nico Rosberg believes he now has the psychological edge over Lewis Hamilton after putting daylight between himself and the Briton in this season's Formula One title race. In a championship game of swings and roundabouts between the Mercedes team-mates, Hamilton's burst of four consecutive wins after Rosberg's triumph in the season opener in Australia, allowed him to finally edge ahead in the drivers' standings. But events over the last two grands prix in Monaco and Canada have conspired against Hamilton, leaving Rosberg to open up a 22-point cushion going into this weekend's return to Austria after an 11-year absence. Feeling positive: Nico Rosberg believes he has the edge over team-mate Lewis Hamilton in the race for the title . With Rosberg now in the ascendancy, the 28-year-old German said: 'If your team-mate has three or four wins in a row that's obviously going to strengthen his position. 'So it was really important to bring that run to an end because psychology is a big part of sports. 'If you have those results behind you, like I do now, it gives you that little bit extra, that little bit of an edge, so it does help. It's important.' Rosberg can also count on lady luck being on his side last time out in Canada after both he and Hamilton suffered identical issues with one of the car's two energy recovery systems. Battling it out: Nico Rosberg, left, and Mercedes team-mate Lewis Hamilton, right . Whereas Hamilton was forced to retire, Rosberg managed to nurse his through severe difficulties before claiming second place behind debut race-winner Daniel Ricciardo in his Red Bull. Rosberg added: 'In hindsight it was damage limitation in Canada, coming second, lots of points. I could look back and say it was still a decent day. 'For the team it sucked because our ambition is to do much better. With reliability problems like that, it's not good. We need to be bulletproof. 'It's a work in progress. We've been good with reliability, but we have had a few problems now, so we have to keep on going and make sure it's 100 per cent, but of course it's never easy.' Sharing the podium: Nico Rosberg, Lewis Hamilton and Daniel Ricciardo after recent race in Monaco . The issues in Canada ended Mercedes' run of six consecutive victories and five successive one-twos, as well as talk of a team going through an entire season unbeaten for the first time in F1's history.'That's not good,' said Rosberg. 'It sucks because our car is fast enough to win every race, so coming away from Canada without the win was a big disappointment for our team. 'We need to bounce back in Austria and finish one-two in every race given the car we have.'","Rosberg has opened up a 22-point cushion going into this weekend's race .

"Dylan Hartley is bracing himself for bad news. The euphoria generated by an Aviva Premiership title triumph is in danger of being shattered by an almighty comedown this week. The grim reality of England’s two-tier tour is becoming apparent and players are coming to terms with the consequences of an administrative shambles far beyond their control. Arguably the most brutal selection of Stuart Lancaster’s tenure looms. There are those who performed with distinction at Eden Park on Saturday, as the depleted visitors came agonisingly close to shocking the All Blacks in the first Test. Fighting for his place: Dylan Hartley runs with the ball during the England training session on Monday . Men such as Freddie Burns, Kyle Eastmond and James Haskell are likely to be ‘rewarded’ for their sterling efforts by being removed from England’s starting XV to make way for some influential reinforcements. The other category contains those players who arrived here late having taken part in the Premiership final. Hartley may be among that number. The Saints captain was in jubilant mood winning at Twickenham, but now the occasion may cost him the England No 2 shirt. Training: Danny Care put through his paces ahead of Saturday's second showdown against New Zealand . Chase: Henry Thomas runs with the ball during the training session at the Onewa Oval on Monday . History: Kyle Sinckler trains with England, who have won just twice on the All Blacks' patch - in 1973 and 2003 . Round two: England prepare ahead of the second of their three-test series against the All Blacks . Pass: Billy Twelvetrees back in training after overcoming an ankle injury that ruled him out first time around . Rob Webber of Bath was superb as England’s starting hooker at Eden Park and has a strong chance of being retained for this Saturday’s second Test in Dunedin. Hartley may have to patiently await the chance to reclaim his lost status and said: ‘You just bide your time and wait for an opportunity and when it comes, you take it. That’s what Rob’s done. He waited for the opportunity and stepped up at the weekend.’ Asked how he would respond, Hartley quipped: ‘Well, I can’t go and take him down in training,’ before adding: ‘Me and Tom Youngs have had it for two years now. You slip up, you give the other guy an opportunity. In my case, slipping up was having to stay behind to play a game. ‘Rob took an opportunity, he played well and I wouldn’t be surprised if we stick with him. There’s the bigger picture as well. It’s good for Tom and myself to know there’s someone else who can step up in that position, it pushes us on. It’s good for the team and with the World Cup we’re going to need three strong hookers.’ Hartley’s refusal to condemn the farcical circumstances is admirable. At least that showpiece final provided him with a high-stakes comeback from a shoulder injury and extra time also worked in his favour. Close: Owen Farrell hopes to cause another upset - but this time with it ending in England victory . Working hard: Anthony Watson trains ahead of the second clash with New Zealand on Saturday morning . Preparation: Tom Wood (left) and Dylan Hartley (right) return to training after the Premiership final clash . Top team: New Zealand won all 14 of their matches in 2013 but England want to give them a dose of reality . Decisions: Stuart Lancaster must choose his side for the second test against New Zealand . ‘The game went for 100 minutes so I got 50 minutes in the end which was good preparation,’ he added. ‘In terms of intensity and being in that environment, a Premiership final with extra time set me up pretty well. I feel fit and strong, the shoulder is not giving me any gyp so I’m ready.’ It may be that the most he is asked to do is take a place among the replacements, a fate which beckons at least one other late arrival who was so impressive during the Six Nations — Billy Vunipola. Hartley warned that  England must be wary of assuming the cavalry charge of reinforcements will lead to a rise in performance in Dunedin. ‘France toured here last year — they were quite competitive in the first game, their Top 14 finalists turned up and they got humped 30-nil or something,’ he said. ‘So, just because the Premiership finalists are back in, doesn’t mean it will automatically happen. We have to be prepared.’ England’s performance in the first Test was an indication of the strides they are making but there is an acceptance that it is high time to claim a meaningful prize. A series victory over the world champions would fit the bill. ‘We need to get over the line somewhere and here is the perfect place to do it,’ said Hartley. ‘By doing it against the All Blacks, it would be a hell of a statement. We’ve only ever won two Tests here, so we’re literally going to make history if we do it. ‘I think, as a team, we’re being talked about. We’re playing good rugby, we’re picking up good wins.’ Exeter hooker Luke Cowan-Dickie flew home from the tour on Monday night to have treatment on a knee injury.","Stuart Lancaster's England train at Onewa Oval ahead of Saturday's game against New Zealand at Forsyth Barr Stadium in Dunedin .

"Tottenham fans who chant the Y-word at White Hart Lane will no longer be arrested - unless an official complaint is made against them. But opposition fans who sing anti-Semitic holocaust songs at Tottenham fans at the ground will still face charges, the Metropolitan police have announced. Constable Steve Payne, Football Intelligence for the Met, told the Tottenham Hotspur Supporters Trust (THST) of the development at a meeting last Monday. Last September the FA warned that using the Y-word was 'derogatory and offensive' and could amount to a criminal offence - and that Tottenham fans could face arrest for singing it. Victory: Tottenham fans who chant the Y-word at home games will not be arrested by the police . Tottenham fans have always insisted that they never use the Y-word maliciously, and a THST statement issued after the FA's warnings said:  'THST is categorically against ejections and banning orders for use of the term by Tottenham supporters in a match environment. 'Our view has always been that should Spurs’ fans’ use of the Y** identity come to an end, this should be as a result of the feeling among the Spurs community that it was time to move on. 'This issue has always been of the utmost importance to us and while we recognise that Spurs fans use of the Y-word and associated identity may have caused some upset to members of the Jewish community, we sincerely believe no Spurs fan uses the term in a malicious way. We do not in any way condone racist language being used by football fans. 'The word ‘Y**' was adopted over 30 years ago by Spurs fans to combat racist abuse aimed towards them at football by opposing fans. It developed into a strong identity status that brought Jewish and non-Jewish Spurs fans together in an incredible show of unity that is admired worldwide. That is what fighting racism within football should be about.' On March 7 the Crown Prosecution Service discontinued cases made against three Totttenham fans arrested for using the Y-word. Eight arrests were made last season for racially aggravated offences at White Hart Lane.","Fans will only be arrested if a complaint is made against them .

"They have been told to be positive at all times, but England had to dig deep before they could have the desired effect at Lord’s when faced with a combination of one of the greatest batsmen in history and a featherbed pitch. Even the best bowlers of all time may have struggled against Kumar Sangakkara on the third day of the first Test once he had decided that this was the day when he would finally make his first Test century at the home of cricket. Yet, when Moeen Ali, almost out of nowhere, forced an edge from a rare loose Sangakkara shot to end his latest high quality century and claim a notable first Test wicket, England suddenly looked capable of claiming a decisive advantage. What a way to start! Moeen Ali is congratulated after taking the wicket of Kumar Sangakkara . Pouched: Prior (left) shows good hands to catch Sagakkara off the bowling of Ali . Getting the jump on him: Mahela Jayawardene (right) leaps on his team-mate Sangakkara to celebrate the ton . Honoured: Sangakkara (second left) celebrates his century - and getting himself on to the famous Lord's board . Going over the top: Sangakkara hits out during his majestic innings of 147 . A dab hand: Sangakkara nurdles the ball down to the third man boundary . They made two further inroads on a day when each wicket had to be hard-earned and, with Sri Lanka at 415 for seven, still 160 behind, there may yet be an interesting finish to a Test that had seemed certain to end in a high-scoring draw. This was an attritional day’s Test cricket, with the balance tipping too far towards bat rather than ball, at least until England took three wickets in a final session which said much for their ability to stick to their task. Certainly an England attack that included two debutants in Chris Jordan and Moeen, plus a man playing his first Test in seven years in Liam Plunkett, initially had little answer to Sangakkara on what is likely to be his last Lord’s appearance. It was left to England’s principal bowlers, Jimmy Anderson and Stuart Broad, to stem the early flood of runs with the first three wickets to fall on the third day on a pitch that has seemed too batsman-friendly. When the truly great batsmen are assessed it is not often that Sangakkara features highly on any list that includes Sachin Tendulkar, Viv Richards, Brian Lara and Ricky Ponting, yet his record stands up against the very best. It is extraordinary to think that none of Tendulkar, Lara or Ponting ever made a Test hundred at Lord’s and in doing so yesterday, the Sri Lankan became the first man to score three Test hundreds in successive innings on three separate occasions. He is one serious performer. Perhaps it is because Sangakkara has a poorer record against England that he can be under-rated here, yet there was an inevitability about his destiny in finally getting his name on the famous Lord’s honours board at 36. He warmed-up by making a hundred here in the one-day series two weeks ago but this was the one he really wanted, celebrating in emotional fashion with his fellow great Mahela Jayawardene. Air Jordan: Chris Jordan jumps for joy after taking the wicket of Nuwan Kulasekara . Back with a bang: Liam Plunkett (left) celebrates the wicket of Prasanna Jayawardene on his Test return . Safe hands: Sam Robson (second left) is congratulated by his team-mates after catching Lahiru Thirimanne . Reaching out: Anderson tries to grab the ball off his own bowling . By that time England knew their chances of forcing a win were diminishing and until Moeen struck they appeared powerless to do anything to stop Sri Lanka replying with gusto to their massive 575 for nine. England want Test groundsmen to provide pitches with pace and bounce this season but there was little of that in Mick Hunt’s low, slow, tired surface that, while it may guarantee five days of lucrative Test cricket, does little for the spectacle. This was more like Colombo than St John’s Wood and that suited Sri Lanka as they attempted to repeat their escape here in 2006, when they earned a draw after England had scored their previous high against them of 551 for six. Pulling power: Angelo Mathews turns a short delivery into the leg side . Early strike: Anderson (centre) celebrates the wicket of Kaushal Silva in the first half an hour of the day . It took a cracking ball from Anderson and a decent catch from Matt Prior to give England their first breakthrough of the day and their second in the innings, sending back Kaushal Silva, but from that moment life became tougher for them. Sangakkara was joined by a batsman almost as great himself in Jayawardene and together the gifted pair added 126 with such consummate ease that it looked feasible then for Sri Lanka to claim a first innings lead of their own. It was apt that when Sangakkara finally went to that 36th Test hundred but first on this ground that Jayawardene should be at his side, his great friend rushing to leap on him and join the celebrations as Sangakkara basked in the adulation. English heads could have dropped but, to their credit, they kept working hard for wickets and captain Alastair Cook did all he could by ringing the bowling changes and coming up with various fielding combinations. Ducking out: Kaushal Silva sways out of the way of an Anderson bouncer . Dark days: Black clouds passed over Lord's in the afternoon . Jayawardene was absolutely plumb to Broad and wasted a review by officially questioning the decision, and the second new ball then claimed another victim when Lahiru Thirimanne lobbed Anderson tamely to mid-wicket. But the big breakthrough was also the most unexpected when Moeen, still more a batsman than bowler but a very promising off-spinner, got some turn and bounce to force a big edge from Sangakkara’s attempted cut. Prior did the rest with another good catch and the Sri Lankan door was slightly ajar for England. As Sangakkara has nine Test double centuries to his name and scored 319 in his last Test against Bangladesh, a score of 147 was almost a failure and he was quickly followed by Prasanna Jayawardene, Ian Bell taking a brilliant reflex catch at leg slip to give Plunkett his first Test wicket since Chris Gayle seven years ago. When Jordan nipped in to take Nuwan Kulasekara’s edge and claim his second wicket, England could be satisfied with their day but they still have much more positive work to do if they are to go to Leeds one up in this two-Test series. When Matt Prior (right) took a smart catch high to his right to get rid of Sri Lanka opener Kaushal Silva, he and James Anderson became England’s leading bowler-wicketkeeper combination with 61 dismissals. The pair overtook Bob Taylor and Ian Botham as the most prolific partnership. Kumar's dream ton . Kumar Sangakkara had scored 35 Test hundreds before this match but had never scored one at Lord’s. He changed that yesterday with a masterful ton for which he was warmly embraced by his old friend and batting partner Mahela Jayawardene. Both men have said this will be their last tour of England as players. India block England's DRS plea . England's bid to use Decision Review System video technology in next month’s Test series against India has been blocked. England officials asked India, the only cricket-playing nation not to employ DRS, to consider its introduction for the four-Test series in the hope that Sachin Tendulkar’s retirement would encourage a change in position. Tendulkar’s distrust of DRS - introduced in 2009 to allow players to challenge to umpires’ decisions - had been the main reason for India refusing to allow its use in any series they play.But India refuse to budge, which will be a blow to  England Cricket Board chairman Giles Clarke. Lights out at Lord's . An unexpected power cut at Lord’s caused consternation on and off the field yesterday. The lights went out twice after lunch, causing both electric scoreboards to stop functioning. Panicked ground staff placed an old-school wooden scorebox from the Nursery Ground under the media centre which had also lost power.","Sangakarra scored 147, his first Test hundred at Lord's .

"Maria Sharapova had hardly stepped off court after her stunning triumph at  Wimbledon 10 years ago when the phone of her long-time agent and business mentor Max Eisenbud started ringing off the hook. A star was born, one with a golden combination. Talented, articulate, driven and extremely photogenic — small wonder that the queue of potential sponsors equalled the line of those seeking her autograph. Eisenbud recalls how they took a hard-headed view: ‘After she won Wimbledon, her life changed. We were offered everything going but we didn’t want Maria to end up like Anna Kournikova.’ Scroll down for videos... It girl: Maria Sharapova has become a business marvel worth an estimated $150million . Golden girl: Maria Sharapova won the 2004 Wimbledon Championships as a 17-year-old . Ten years on, that appears to have been a wise course of action. Sharapova, while curiously not having added to her Wimbledon tally, is still winning Grand Slam titles but has also acquired riches beyond most athletes’ dreams. Kournikova, meanwhile, is largely forgotten. Only two weeks ago, Sharapova was posing with her second French Open title in front of the Eiffel Tower. She couples this with  topping the Forbes list of highest earning female athletes. The 27-year-old Russian’s net worth is estimated at $150million (£88m) and her annual earnings at around $27m (£15.9m). Her dual success on and off the court is a phenomenon. As Sharapova admits, she had little idea what that 2004 triumph at the All England Club would bring. ‘At 17 you’re not too business- savvy,’ she tells me in her calm, matter-of-fact way. ‘My parents helped me and their support and understanding kept me realistic. ‘I lived in a very real world. I had just won Wimbledon but you go back to Florida and the barista is still making the coffee. One of the reasons I have been able to keep that success and carry on with all the things I do is that I love going on the court and love competing. ‘But I also have opportunities to do things that make me happy. If you don’t have that passion you are never going to be really successful. Things are always going to be a drag and pull you in so many directions when you are a 17-year-old who has won Wimbledon.’ Largely forgotten: Maria Sharapova's manager didn't want her going the same way as Anna Kournikova . French fancy: Maria Sharapova has won five Grand Slams including the 2014 French Open (above) Eisenbud played tennis on the American college circuit and graduated to become the manager of IMG’s junior talent programme. ‘I saw her play for the first time at Bradenton (Nick Bollettieri’s academy), aged nine,’ he says. ‘It was like when you look at that video of the young Tiger Woods. She practised non-stop for an hour and a half and didn’t even drink any water.’ He remains her manager and has helped her launch Sugarpova, her own sweets (Sharapova responds to questions about whether  she should be promoting sugar  products with the same disdain that meets inquiries about whether the yelp she lets out when hitting the ball is an attractive trait). ‘For the last four to five years she has wanted to own something  herself,’ says Eisenbud of the  burgeoning Sugarpova project. ‘We talked to a guy called Jeff Rubin who owns a successful candy business. He kind of blurted out ‘Sugarpova’ over dinner one night. ‘Maria is great at compartmentalising the tennis stuff and all the stuff off the court. She is going to be very successful in business when she is done playing. When she has 300 days per year to devote to it, it will be good, and she is putting all the foundations in.’ Eye of the tiger: While the Russian enjoys business opportunities, nothing rivals competing on the court . Sweet tooth: Business savvy Maria Sharapova has recntly branched out with her own line of confectionery . Asked when that day might come, he replies: ‘About four or five years, it could be less.’Sharapova has suffered injuries and gone through dips in form. Yet her love of competing sees her address her on-court career with an ability to shut out distractions. Eisenbud makes an interesting observation about how she maintains such focus: ‘Most of her friends are not in tennis. Some players meet someone for the first time and the next thing you know they are in their player box. But in there you want people who have been working with you in the trenches. She is firm about that.’ It was notable in Paris that Sharapova’s entourage amounted to three, no more than when she won Wimbledon 10 years ago. Her first time at SW19 was in 2002, when she lost the Wimbledon junior final: ‘I remember the junior final was on the Sunday, after the men had finished. I was one of the last people leaving and it was quite late and nearly dark, a bit eerie. Trappings of fame: Maria Sharapova is collected for the WTA party by F1 driver Mark Webber in a Porsche . Love match: Maria Sharapova is going out with fellow tennis professional Grigor Dimitrov . ‘I was driving away and thinking how special it is. I was upset because I’d lost and I was thinking about the match, but I looked back and thought, “How beautiful is this”, and that I couldn’t wait to be back and I’d really like to win it. ‘In 2004 it was a bit of a mess because our housing situation didn’t work out,’ she recalls. ‘We ended up staying with a family with three young kids. There were a lot of 6am wake-up calls from the kids. I still wonder how I coped and the morning after the final just holding my replica trophy with them in their garden like it was no big deal. ‘The final was surreal, something that as a young player you think of as the Mecca of tennis. I had horse blinders on, I didn’t think about anything. That’s why I was fearless. I took it as if I was playing on court No 20, although I was on Centre Court in front of thousands of people playing for the championship. No fear: Maria Sharapova remembers playing without worry when she won Wimbledon in 2004 . Early shower: Maria Sharapova crashed out in the second round of the Championships last year . ‘I’d got to the quarter-finals a  couple of weeks before in Paris and that was a thrill for me. And with every match at Wimbledon I felt I was playing better. I remember the match against (Daniela) Hantuchova was one of my best. I got that form and didn’t let it drop. ‘Playing Serena in the final, it had been an accomplishment getting there, and I just went with it.’It is a surprise to her that she has not won again at the All England Club, but twice in Paris on clay to add to US and Australian Open titles, which for years her movement looked so unsuited for. It seems hard to believe that it was all 10 summers ago. ‘If somebody had asked me then if I would win all four Slams and be No 1, I don’t think I would believe it, because you almost believe at 17 that everything is such big luck,’ she says. ‘But here I am.’","Maria Sharapova first won Wimbledon in 2004 as a 17-year-old .

"The battle for mortgage customers has taken a new turn – with one bank launching a six-year fixed rate deal. A string of major lenders have slashed their interest rates and fees in recent days in an apparent end-of-year sale to meet targets. The tussle for business has seen several lenders drop their rates below 3 per cent for people looking for a five-year fixed rate mortgage. Scroll down for video . A string of major lenders have slashed their interest rates and fees in recent days in an apparent end-of-year sale to meet targets (File photo) Now, Virgin Money has launched a fixed rate six-year deal starting from 2.99 per cent – the same rate as some of its equivalent five-year products. The bank said that, while seven and ten-year deals are already on the market, the six-year deal offers a ‘middle ground’ to house buyers who are scared of locking in for longer. Experts said it is ‘great news’ for consumers as many rush to sign up to fixed rate deals before the Bank of England raises its base rate, pushing up mortgage repayments. Industry figures said banks are driving down prices at the moment in a desperate bid to attract more buyers to hit their end-of-year targets. A rising number of new lenders has helped to increase competition and push down rates. There has also been an ‘improved appetite’ among banks to lend now that they have got to grips with tougher lending rules . A rising number of new lenders has helped to increase competition and push down rates. There has also been an ‘improved appetite’ among banks to lend now that they have got to grips with tougher lending rules introduced in April, it was claimed. The market saw some disruption earlier this year as lenders adjusted to stricter rules which required them to carry out extra checks on borrowers’ spending habits to ensure they could afford repayments if interest rates rose. The number of mortgage approvals dipped around that time before heading back upwards. David Hollingworth, head of communications at London and Country Mortgages, said: ‘Lenders have let these processes bed in before rolling their sleeves up to get some business back in. This is not just window dressing, lenders are looking to do business.’ Banks put up interest rates over the summer amid fears of an imminent hike of the base rate rise, but they have since fallen back below 5 per cent for five-year fixed rates for the first time in three months. In mid-July, the best rate on a fixed rate five-year deal was 3.09 per cent from Metro, while many banks are now offering well below 3 per cent. Virgin Money has launched a five-year fixed rate at 2.79 per cent . Virgin Money has launched a five-year fixed rate at 2.79 per cent, while Metro’s five-year deals now start from 2.99 per cent.

"Andy Murray showed that he is quite prepared to think outside the box by appointing Ivan Lendl, and now he has done it again by appointing Amelie Mauresmo. The move, the likelihood of which was revealed eleven days ago in Sportsmail, is a groundbreaking one which will make his campaign to defend his Wimbledon title all the more fascinating. Although initially denied, there always seemed to be something in it when she turned up to watch the whole of his first match at the French Open and reputable sources suggested that contact had been made between them. Appointment: Andy Murray, training today at Queen's, has appointed Amelie Mauresmo as his new coach . Top job: The two-time Grand Slam winner will take over in time for  Queen's . Murray knew that he could not replicate the presence of Lendl – who had little coaching experience before their famously successful partnership, but what he is looking for is someone who can add that little extra input which, at the rarefied level he plays at, can be the difference between winning and losing. The appointment is initially for the grasscourt season spanning Queen’s and Wimbledon, but it has very much been made with the longer term in mind. 'I’m excited by the possibilities of the new partnership and Amelie is someone I have always looked up to and admired,' said Murray of the appointment. 'Excited': Murray said Mauresmo was someone he 'always looked up to and admired' Champ: Mauresmo won Wimbledon in 2006 and the Australian Open in the same year . 'She’s faced adversity plenty of times in her career, but was an amazing player and won major titles, including Wimbledon. 'I have a very strong coaching team already in place, but I think Amelie brings with her experience and tactical expertise and will push us all to improve.  Everyone I know talks very highly of Amelie, as a person and coach, and I’m convinced that her joining the team will help us push on - I want to win more grand slams.' As Murray said in response to Sportsmail’s story that Mauresmo was in the frame, the presence of a woman can tame the egos that sometimes prevail when you have an all-male team. And she is someone he can respect as she is a proven winner like he is, rather than purely a professional coach who can work as a technician on his game, which is unlikely to radically change anyway at this point of his career. Previous: Mauresmo already has experience of coaching man, having worked with Michael Llodra . Exit: Murray lost to Rafa Nadal in the semi-finals of the French Open in Paris . Mauresmo was an athletic all court player who won both the Australian Open and Wimbledon, and she herself is an innovative thinker like him who will relish the challenge of taking on such a fascinating individual who always has the capacity to surprise. This and the pure fact that he is now stepping out on his beloved grass should be a tonic after the thumping he received from Rafael Nadal in Paris on Friday. Mauresmo also has experience of coaching a man, having worked with Frenchman Michael Llodra over the grass court season of 2010 when he won the Eastbourne ATP event. She was also in the team of Marion Bartoli when she won Wimbledon last year, so she is well qualified on all sides to understand the unique pressures of lasting the whole fortnight at the All England Club. Tonic: Murray will have to recover from the thumping he took at the hands of Nadal . 'I’m really excited to be able to work with Andy,' said Mauresmo, who won Wimbledon and the Australian Open in 2006. 'He’s an amazingly talented tennis player and I feel I have plenty to offer both him and the team around him. I’m looking forward to getting down to work and helping him win more Grand Slams. A little like Lendl, she may also serve to deflect some of those pressures just by being there on his bench alongside his trusted assistant coach Dani Vallverdu. She added: 'Andy contacted me a few weeks ago and we started to talk about this possibility to work, to be working together. It's not really something that I was thinking doing when I stopped being a tennis player. 'Then we talked again a little bit more about how to do the things maybe about his game, about different things. 'We came up with the will from both sides to, yeah, to give it a shot. Contact: Mauresmo said the pair had been discussing working together for a few weeks . Long term: Mauresmo suggested the pair would team not just on a short team basis . 'We all know his mother was a big part of his tennis career. I think he's maybe looking for something different, about emotions and sensitive things. It's not really interesting for me, this part of the story, to be honest. All I'm interested in is to be able to help him in his goals. That's about it. The rest is the story for you to write, I guess. 'But, yeah, for me it's a challenge. I want to take it.' She clearly suggested that both were looking long term and when asked about how much time they would spend together said: 'Not the whole year, not as full time, but, yes, a significant amount of weeks that we have agreed on and should be good for everyone.' Women coaching men in professional tennis is not unknown at present but it is highly unusual. Uzbekistan’s Denis Istomin is coached by his mother, while another top 100 player, Kazakhstan’s Mikhail Kukushkin, is coached by his wife Anastasia. Murray has already drawn praise from many figures in the women’s game such as Chris Evert for contemplating having a woman in charge, and now he has followed through on that.

Wran, who is understood to have been suffering from a methamphetamine addiction for months, was believed to be so desperate to score drugs she acted as 'a door girl' to help gain entry to the squalid apartment, where a fight broke out with Mr McNulty, who was stabbed twice and died from the wounds. Another man inside the flat, Brett Fitzgerald, was stabbed several times, but was taken to hospital and survived.

"Marco Reus' World Cup place could be in doubt after the Germany star limped out of his country's 6-1 win against Armenia after suffering suspected ankle ligament damage. The Borussia Dortmund went down after he tussled for the ball with opposing midfielder Artur Yedigaryan.

With Joachim Low's side set to face Portugal in their World Cup opener on June 16, Reus could be ruled out of this summer's tournament if his injury is deemed serious. Reus will now be assessed before Low decides whether to call up a replacement for the trip to Brazil. Speaking after the game, Low said: 'We can only hope that he will be OK. But it looked bad. We can call up another player until 24 hours before the first game.'

"Shots: 5 . Shots on target: 0 . Goals: 0 . Touches: 50 . Touches in the box: 10 . Diego Costa's proposed transfer to Chelsea will have excited many fans before the World Cup. But after some dismal displays for Spain, some may be hoping Jose Mourinho has a change of heart. Samuel Eto'o and Fernando Torres were criticised for their lack of potency all season, and for their lack of desire to break into the box. But with the world champions crashed out of the tournament in Brazil, Costa barely tried to influence play against the brave Chileans. VIDEO Scroll down to see Costa nutmegged by soon-to-be Chelsea team-mate Azpilcueta . Flopped: Diego Costa failed to inspire Spain as they were dumped out of the World Cup by Chile . Not in the game: Costa has had five shots in the tournament but is yet to hit the target . Not involved: Costa has touched the ball 50 times in the tournament... (Chile left and Holland right) Embarrassing: Costa is replaced by Chelsea flop Torres... will Diego be the next one? Costa was praised after a fine campaign with Atletico Madrid for his all-action style, creating and scoring chances out of nothing, displaying some of the raw power Didier Drogba showed during his legendary stint at Stamford Bridge. Mourinho has admitted that Costa was the star striker he was after this summer, with Eto'o and Torres grabbing a total of 14 goals between them in the Premier League last season. The World Cup was his chance to show what he was all about. But after zero shots on target and just 21 touches so far in the tournament, his reputation could begin to slide. With Brazil crying out for a dominant centre forward, Costa may regret not making the decision to ply for his home country, instead of figuring in Spain's tiki-taka system which is out of date, and out of ideas. In fairness to the target man, it simply doesn't suit his style. Mourinho has a habit of getting the best out of players like Costa, and while his confidence may be restored quickly upon returning from South America, English football demands more of an impact for a £32million rated star.

"'Cape Verde? Heard of it, but remind me... ' That was always my response to any mention of the place. So here's the answer: Cabo Verde, as it's properly known, is a necklace of ten islands in the Atlantic, 350 miles west of Africa, off the coast of Senegal. It's a near six-hour flight from the UK. The sunshine is utterly reliable, as is the breeze from the Sahara. Surf's up: The Cape Verdean island of Sal is (relatively) well known as a haven for unhurried sunshine holidays . The windiest time is November to March, which is bliss for surfers. The islands of Sal and Boa Vista are the big destinations for beach-and-a-book breaks. Of the hotels on Sal, the most comfy and glamorous is the Morabeza in the fishing village of Santa Maria. There's a 200-yard walk to miles of glorious beach where boats bob on the turquoise water. Life here slows down to turtle pace. In the evenings you can watch the fishwives gutting their catch on the pier. Santa Maria is a haven for yachting and water sports. The current world champion kite surfer lives here. But once you've bathed in Sal's inland version of the Dead Sea and visited its superb coast, you may want a bit more. Bright and lovely: The streets of Mindelo, the capital of Sao Vicente, are flanked by colourfully painted houses . Sounds to soothe: Music is a big part of Cape Verde life. The islands have their own musical style, morna . There's plenty of variety in this tiny 39-year-old republic, a former colony of Portugal, whose intrepid sailors discovered the islands in the 1450s. It's a 30-minute flight from Sal to the island of Sao Vicente, where we stayed in Mindelo, a colourful harbour town that, thanks to its Portuguese and British heritage, looks like Lisbon crossed with Portmeirion in Wales. Locals all speak Creole, a mish-mash of umpteen languages, African and European. 'It was designed to fool the Portuguese,' as one local graduate explained to me. Mindelo has fewer tourists, most of them are French. They come for the music scene and to worship the late singer Cesaria Evora, 'the barefoot diva'. Her voice remains the islands' proudest export and she is revered by Parisians. On the edge of town is a peak, Monte Verde, well worth the three-hour walk up its switchback road past cactus flowers, wrinkly old men with donkeys and the occasional goat. A place of wild wonder: Santo Antao, the most westerly island of Cape Verde, is a great destination for hikers . The view from the top is worth every blister. An hour by ferry from Sao Vicente is the mountainous island of Santo Antao. Hike the ribeiras (river valleys). After the moon-like aridity of Sal, they are an emerald paradise. I took a local guide — supplied by Cape Verde Experience — in a four-wheel drive to the top of a 1,000m-high volcanic peak, then walked down a hairpin trail of wonky basalt cobbles past the cauldron of the vast volcano. When the rains come, water bombs down the rocky gullies, washing away cattle and everything else in its path. As you slowly descend, cooking smoke and the sounds of a village rise to greet you. Hens cluck and you walk past tiny children in crocodiles wandering home from school for lunch. Dragonflies flit over streams flanked by mango trees, papayas, and huge hands of green bananas. Later, in a straw-roofed cafe, I ate a banana served with local molasses - quite the best pud I've ever had. The old seaside village of Paul has a tiny distillery with a donkey-driven mill for crushing sugar cane - a sight that hasn't changed in centuries. Walk me to the beach: Colourful boats are a constant presence in an archipelago where fishing is crucial . But it's the people of Cape Verde that make it irresistible. Catholic, strict but loving with their kids, proud of their mixed heritage and all addicted to Premier League football. Centenarians are common. Enzo, a born-and-bred barman in Mindelo, tells me that his grandfather had died at 102. I clearly didn't look impressed enough. 'He was very unfit,' he adds apologetically. The Cape Verde Experience (0845 330 2047, www.capeverde.co.uk) offers seven-night island-hopping holidays from £1,433 per person or 14 nights from £1,755 per person, both including flights. A week's stay at the four-star Hotel Morabeza on the island of Sal costs from £873 pp, based on two sharing a double land view room with bed and breakfast, including return flights and transfers.","The Cape Verde islands sit some 350 miles west of the African mainland .

"The drink-drive limit is to be cut in Scotland in time for Christmas, it was announced today. Justice Secretary Kenny MacAskill revealed plans which to reduce the blood alcohol limit from 80mg in every 100ml of blood to 50mg from December 5. It would bring Scotland in line with the rest of Europe, but would mean the limit is lower than that in England and Wales. Drivers in Scotland are warned that the drink drive limit will be cut from 80mg in every 100ml of blood to 50mg from December 5 . Mr MacAskill said the new limit would send a 'clear message' to drivers who ignore the warnings that there is never an excuse to drink and drive. He said: 'Drink-driving shatters families and communities and we must take action to reduce the risk on our roads. 'The latest estimates show that approximately one in 10 deaths on Scottish roads involve drivers who are over the legal limit and research shows that even just one alcoholic drink before driving can make you three times as likely to be involved in a fatal car crash. 'As a result, 20 families every year have to cope with the loss of a loved one and around 760 people are treated for injuries caused by someone who thought it was acceptable to drink alcohol and get behind the wheel and drive. We cannot let this continue. 'That's why I have today introduced legislation to lower the drink-drive limit in Scotland so that, subject to parliamentary approval, new laws will be in place in time for the beginning of the festive period.' Scottish Justice Secretary Kenny MacAskill (centre) said the new limit would send a 'clear message' to drivers who ignore the warnings that there is never an excuse to drink and drive . The Scottish Government previously announced the intention to reduce the limit following a consultation which found almost three-quarters of those who responded believed the drink-drive limit should be lowered. Mr MacAskill added: 'Getting behind the wheel after drinking can have fatal consequences. The advice is simple: if you have had any alcoholic drink whatsoever, don't drive. No-one should be drinking and driving and the new lower limit only reinforces what should already be the case with drivers taking full responsibility and not putting lives at risk. 'Lowering the drink-drive limit will help make Scotland's roads safer. It is the right thing to do and, most importantly, it will save lives, meaning that fewer families have to go through the heartache of a loved one lost.' The Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents (RoSPA) welcomed the announcement and called for the rest of the UK to follow suit. Sandy Allan, RoSPA's road safety manager in Scotland, said: 'There is a considerable body of research which shows that reducing drink-drive limits is effective in reducing drink-drive deaths and injuries. We would like to see the rest of the UK follow Scotland's example.'","Limit to be cut from 80mg in every 100ml of blood to 50mg on December 5 .

"Brilliant. I totally applaud Stuart Lancaster’s decision to try Manu Tuilagi on the right wing in Dunedin, even if it backfires and possibly costs England the Test. It is the bold move of a coach who is deadly serious about winning the 2015 World Cup — and that really excites me. The Luther Burrell-Billy Twelvetrees combination at centre was a big success last season and with both now fit and available it makes sense to reunite them. But you want all your best players involved and Tuilagi is fresh, confident and playing well. VIDEO Scroll down to see Stuart Lancaster speaking after New Zealand's second Test win . Bold move: Stuart Lancaster named Manu Tuilagi to start on the right wing . New Zealand away is the biggest Test in rugby and by the end of next week England will know if the experiment is worth pursuing. What are the pluses? Tuilagi is a world-class strike runner but because he has to be closely marked at all times he can also be the perfect decoy. It is possible he will hardly touch the ball in Dunedin but indirectly contribute to two or three England tries. Tuilagi may look nothing like Jason Robinson but tactically he provides the same threat because he is nigh on unstoppable one-on-one if he takes the ball at pace in the right area. Centre of attention: Billy Twelvetrees is set to start in the centre for England . My dream scenario for Tuilagi would be any attacking England scrum anywhere from five to 25 metres out with a biggish blindside on the right. Put Tuilagi out there deep on his own and line up all the other backs going left. All Danny Care would then need is a solid scrum or a slight wheel to help take the All Blacks’ back row out of the equation and it’s game on. A perfectly timed pass to Tuilagi at full tilt will leave only one defender to beat. Jason Robinson once scored a beauty under the posts against France using the same move. World-class strike runner: Tuilagi can provide the perfect decoy . On the attack: Sir Clive Woodward believes Tuilagi can have a similar impact on the wing as Jason Robinson . New Zealand might put an extra man in defence on the blindside. In which case call their bluff and go left. The predictable thing would have been to start Tuilagi at No 13 again but that is why I like this selection — the New Zealand back line will be starting from scratch in how to deal with him from the wing, while facing another threat in Burrell. What are the negatives? Tuilagi doesn’t turn that quickly and although he may be competent under the high ball, you don’t get much practice in midfield. New Zealand’s tactical kickers, as well as testing him with a few bombs, will roll little grubbers behind him and get Tuilagi going backwards. Under pressure, he could make mistakes. I enjoyed Lancaster’s frankness when questioned about Tuilagi’s aerial skills, saying Manu will thump anyone who beats him to the ball. It reminded me of when I first selected Jason Robinson at full back against Australia in 2001. Wrecking ball: The decision to pair Luther Burrell with Billy Twelvetrees at centre is a positive one . At 5ft 8in many doubted his ability under the high ball. I was sitting with Jason when he was asked how he was going to deal with that situation. ‘I’ll jump,’ was his response. Selection is about picking players for what they can do — not based on perceived weaknesses. Tuilagi needs to stay alert. On the Lions tour of South Africa in 1980 I was moved from the centre to the right wing in the third Test. We led 10-6 with 10 minutes to go when Naas Botha kicked long into our 25 and I side-footed into touch. Fatally, I turned my back as I jogged back into my unaccustomed position and the Boks struck. Gerrie Germishuys threw a quick line-out to Theuns Stofberg and although I got back to make a tackle he offloaded to Germishuys and they were in for a converted try. We lost 12-10. Don’t switch off for a second. Especially if you are a centre who has just moved to the wing!","The decision to switch Manu Tuilagi to the right wing is the bold move of a coach who is deadly serious about winning the World Cup .

"While England still have one warm-up game left against Honduras, Italy drew their final match  against minnows Luxembourg – who are 102 places below England in the FIFA World Rankings - on Wednesday. And post-match, manager Cesare Prandelli and his players admitted that they are some way short of their best ahead of their opening game against England in Manaus on June 14. Sportsmail looks at five ways that Roy Hodgson's side can find joy against the Italians: . VIDEO Scroll down to watch Balotelli frustration as Italy only manage a draw . Room to improve: Mario Balotelli and his Italy team-mates are yet to hit top form . Hand it to them: Luxembourg coach Luc Holtz (left) and his staff celebrate holding Italy to a draw . 1. They can’t defend at corners . Prandelli admitted that his side had to improve on ‘a few things’ and that one of those was a weakness at corners. Luxembourg’s shock equaliser came as former-Sheffield United centre-back Maxime Chanot lost his marker to nod home in almost the last passage of play in Italy’s World Cup warm-up campaign. Centre-back Giorgio Chiellini admitted: ‘We need to pay more attention at set-pieces. We were good for 50-60 minutes but after that we got a bit stretched and we lost our heads a bit.’ With Gary Cahill and Phil Jagielka both scoring at dead ball opportunities against Peru last week, Roy Hodgson would be foolish not to focus on a typical English strength and Italian weakness. 2. They are running out of time to get it right . AC Milan right-back Mattia De Sciglio conceded that Italy’s new system ‘needs time to find its balance’ as well as a need to ‘improve in attack’ while Marco Verratti blamed the draw on being ‘the first game in which we tried a new plan’. Back to basics: Mattia De Sciglio says Italy are still coming to terms with how to play . Talking tactics: Italy coach Cesare Prandelli (right) gets his point across to Claudio Marchisio . ‘We’re working hard, but we know that when the World Cup comes around we’ll be ready,’ he added. Unfortunately for the young pair, they don’t have a lot of time. There are 10 days until the Manaus showdown but Wednesday was Italy’s last game before then. England, on the other hand, have another game to help them find their way – albeit without the suspended Raheem Sterling who had been touted as a potential starter. 3. They waste chances on goal . Another problem pointed out by De Sciglio was Italy’s profligacy in attack – claiming that they were the better side before being ‘caught with a sucker-punch’. Prandelli singled out Mario Balotelli as the chief culprit, throwing away three good chances. Wasteful: Mario Balotelli missed a host of chances against Luxembourg on Wednesday evening . ‘Mario had two good opportunities in the first half, and had another chance when Cassano came on,’ he said. ‘We’ve missed a few chances tonight, and then conceded a goal from a corner.’ If England can wind-up and frustrate the Italian talisman – which isn’t usually too difficult – they might be able to provide a similar ‘sucker-punch’ to last night’s opponents.4. They rely too much on space out wide . Italy’s goal on Wednesday came from the right wing, and De Sciglio made it clear afterwards that exploiting the flanks was key to their new system. Verratti added to his team-mate’s sentiments, saying: ‘The coach asked us to play between the lines, but it was not easy because Luxembourg firmly closed spaces.’ Quick feet: Marco Verratti (right) gets away from a Lexembourg defender . Glen Johnson and Leighton Baines will need to be at their best to stop the Azzurri wide-men but also ready to use their opponents’ new system to their advantage. De Sciglio and Prandelli both mentioned the amount of space left out wide and England’s full-backs should be key to taking three points in Manaus. 5. They haven’t won since September . Wednesday represented Italy’s seventh consecutive game without a win, with the likes of Demark, Armenia, Nigeria and Ireland getting results against the Azzurri. Plenty to ponder: Cesare Prandelli has much to work on before Italy's game with England on June 14 . Along with Luxembourg, England are ranked above all of these sides – only Spain and Germany are better teams in the winless sequence. And Chiellini’s assertion that Italy are not ‘great at friendlies, but fortunately seem to be okay when it gets serious’ doesn’t wash. Prandelli said afterwards that he ‘didn’t see anything worrying’ from his side – but he is in denial, even later admitting that they were lacking flair. England should make it eight games without a win.","Italy could only draw 1-1 with minnows Luxembourg on Wednesday .

"Barcelona have aimed a dig at Cesc Fabregas for not scoring enough goals during his three years with club. The midfielder, who signed for Chelsea for £30million on Thursday, scored 42 goals in 151 matches for the Spanish giants.

A statement on the club's official website said: 'Despite glowing starts to each campaign, Cesc’s contributions to the cause gradually decreased as each season drew to a close. 'From being someone who joined in with the attack, supplying and scoring goals, the magic tended to fade later on in each season.

"There were both positives and negatives to be taken from England's defeat to Italy in their World Cup opener. The boldness shown by Young Lions Raheem Sterling, Daniel Sturridge and Danny Welbeck in attack chimed with the adventurous approach demanded by the nation. But weaknesses were exposed at the back when Italy scored their two goals, suggesting Roy Hodgson must find greater balance in the team, while Wayne Rooney's performance came in for criticism. Ahead of Thursday's match with Uruguay, our reporters have selected the team and the tactics they would choose for this must-win match. See if you agree and join in the debate in the comments box below. VIDEO Team Profile: England . First picks: The England team that played against Italy in Manaus on Saturday night . JEFF POWELL . Hart; Johnson, Jones, Cahill, Baines; Gerrard; Sterling, Lampard, Barkley; Sturridge, Rooney . The team needs balance to offer better protection to the back four. Gerrard can help with that if he stays anchored, while Lampard’s  engine and experience can help the youngsters control midfield better than against Italy. Plus we have Rooney back in the position he should play, which would support Sturridge. LEE CLAYTON . Hart; Johnson, Jagielka, Cahill, Baines; Gerrard, Henderson, Barkley; Sterling, Sturridge, RooneyRooney at centre forward. He’s scored 39 international goals. He’s up against Diego Lugano, who is 33 and has just been given the boot by West Brom. Play him with his back to goal and then build pace all around him, with Sturridge and Sterling running off him right and left. Barkley would come in to help create more chances and to win free kicks around the box. And I’m backing Leighton Baines to score from one. He was exposed in the first game, but he’s an outstanding left back. Mixed bag: Wayne Rooney helped set up England's goal, scored by Daniel Sturridge, but otherwise endured a frustrating evening out on the left wing against Italy . Purposeful: Ross Barkley looked lively after coming off the bench against Italy and is in contention to start against Uruguay . MATT LAWTON . Hart; Johnson, Cahill, Jagielka, Baines; Gerrard, Henderson; Sterling, Rooney, Welbeck; Sturridge. I'd go with the team that is being talked about, with Rooney through the middle and Welbeck and Sterling wide. I'm nervous about the back four but I don't see much of an alternative. ROB DRAPER . Hart; Johnson, Cahill, Jagielka, Baines; Henderson, Gerrard; Sterling, Rooney, Welbeck; Sturridge . Rooney central because the threat from Uruguay's midfield is nothing like that from Italy's. However, Rooney, Sterling and Welbeck to rotate positions. Oxlade-Chamberlain, if fit, should be an early change and then Ross Barkley. Decision time: Roy Hodgson must decide whether to stick with the England side that lost 2-1 to Italy on Saturday night or tweak the team and tactics for the Uruguay clash . Good showing: Danny Welbeck looked lively on the right-hand side but could potentially lose his place if Hodgson switches around the midfield . Comeback: Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain's return from injury gives England another attacking option . PETE JENSON . Hart; Johnson, Jagielka, Cahill, Baines; Gerrard, Henderson; Welbeck, Sterling, Rooney; Sturridge . The centre of Uruguay’s defence struggles with direct running so keep Sterling through the middle with Welbeck right running at Caceres. Rooney starts on the left but you make good use of the bench. Uruguay tired badly against Costa Rica so you want Barclay and the Ox getting a good half-hour. MATT BARLOW . Hart; Johnson, Jagielka, Cahill, Baines; Gerrard, Henderson; Welbeck, Sterling, Rooney; Sturridge . Don't see a reason to change the personnel. That's about as good as we are. We could tighten it defensively but that would be at a cost and it would be a shame to step back from the attacking edge everyone enjoyed against Italy. I hope the team is unchanged but with more flexibility and rotation within the three behind Sturridge. And more forward movement from Henderson. Back of the net: Daniel Sturridge turns in Wayne Rooney's cross from the left to bring England back to level terms against Italy . LAURA WILLIAMSON . Hart, Johnson, Cahill, Jagielka, Baines; Gerrard, Henderson; Sterling, Rooney, Welbeck; Sturridge . Play Rooney through the middle or not at all, and give Baines more protection by using the hard-working Welbeck in front of him on the left. I'm not sure England need two holding midfielders, so I would encourage Henderson to sit slightly further forward than Gerrard, too. RIATH AL-SAMARRAI . Hart; Johnson, Cahill, Jagielka, Baines; Gerrard, Henderson; Sterling, Rooney, Lallana; Sturridge . Initially advocated dropping Rooney, but can't help feeling this week's debate will bring the best from him, so long as he plays centrally. Sterling has the versatility to move and Lallana proved himself on the left with Southampton. Flying: Adam Lallana is also in contention for a starting berth after coming off the bench in Manaus . CHRIS WHEELER . Hart; Johnson, Cahill, Jagielka, Baines; Gerrard, Henderson; Sterling, Barkley, Welbeck; Sturridge . The Rooney debate is getting boring now, so let’s give him a rest and play Ross Barkley behind Daniel Sturridge. Danny Welbeck is more used to that left-sided role than his Manchester United teammate, and Rooney can be used as an impact sub after an hour if things aren’t going well.

"A single plucky porcupine fought off the unwelcome attention of 17 lions after they surrounded him at night in the open savannah. The prickly animal was caught in the open by the pride on the Londolozi Game Reserve in South Africa, which is a private reserve bordering the vast Kruger National Park. But it was clear he was not prepared to become a light snack (with integral toothpicks) for the hungry lions and used his quills to fight them off. Footage of the remarkable battle was uploaded to YouTube by workers at the Londolozi reserve last week and has already been viewed more than 100,000 times. Keeper Lucien Beaumont described the sequence of events on the Londolozi reserve's blog. The Mhangeni pride had been resting all afternoon, he said, until night fell and it began to cool. 'The pride soon became active and started to move with the four male lions in tow. Suddenly we saw the group clump together and it looked like they were surrounding something of interest.' When he caught up with the pride he found they had encircled a tiny porcupine and were beginning to prod and paw at it, to see how they could take a bite. 'All was not lost however and the porcupine began to shake its tail (known as a rattle) – the sound of the quills makes a distracting noise,' said Mr Beaumont. 'The porcupine began to run backwards into any lion that would come too close for comfort, a common defense mechanism for a threatened porcupine.' Porcupines' quills are fused hairs coated with thick plates of keratin, and they are embedded in the skin musculature. They are released by contact with a predator who gets too close, causing pain and potentially leading to an infection. Crested porcupines like the one in the video are found across Africa and as far north as Italy. They weigh between 30lb and 60lb and their entire bodies are covered with bristles. They also have a mane of quills running along their heads, napes and backs that can be raised into a crest for protection. If bothered by predators, a crested porcupine stamps its feet, shake its quills and charge rear end first to try to stab its enemy with its crest. They are known to have killed lions, leopards, hyenas and even humans.","Prickly animal was caught in the open at private reserve in South Africa .

"England’s last World Cup warm-up match in Miami was electrifying and surprising; sadly, though, that was just the weather. For English spectators there was something wholly unprecedented: a 44-minute break for an electrical storm, as bolts of lightning threatened crowd safety. However, there was little to match that excitement on the pitch. In a game that was in danger of degenerating into a  brawl – four Honduras players were booked, with Brayan Beckeles sent off for his second yellow on 65 minutes as well as three cautions for England - Roy Hodgson will at least be happy to emerge from this game relatively unscathed. Battle: England were held to a goalless draw by Honduras in their final World Cup warm-up match . England: Hart (Forster 75), Johnson, Cahill, Jagielka, Baines, Gerrard (Barkley 45), Henderson (Lampard 83), Lallana, Sturridge, Rooney (Wilshere 45), Welbeck (Lambert 79). Subs not used: Foster, Smalling, Jones, Milner, Sterling, Shaw, Stones, Flanagan. Booked: Cahill, Lallana, Baines.

Subs not used: Lopez, Osman Chavez, Montes, Oscar Garcia, Rony Martinez, Escober. Booked: Beckeles, Izaguirre, Garrido, Bernardez. Sent off: Beckeles. Referee: Ricardo Salazar (USA) Attendance: 45,379. England . should have won – Daniel Sturridge missed two excellent chances in . either half - and Danny Welbeck, Jordan Henderson and Adam Lallana all . stood out with energetic and authoritative performances which will . surely confirm their presence in the starting eleven against Italy next . week. But otherwise there . was little to commend. England were good enough, without thrilling . anyone. Their movement and fluidity looked a little better yet they . still only created occasional chances in the twenty five minutes they . played against ten men. In short, it is time for the phoney war to come . to an end and the real stuff to begin. No-one will condemn England on . the basis of yesterday evening’s fare; from next weekend, though, the . judgements will be less forgiving. ‘Honduras . were quite physical and it was one of the most frustrating games I have . been involved with for a long time and one that I will very, very soon . forget,’ said Hodgson. ‘I though the tempo of our play and effort to . score in the second half was commendable. I will take the draw and take . the fact that we got out without any injuries.’ Frustration: Daniel Sturridge missed England's best opportunities at Sun Life Stadium . Delay: England's game against Honduras was postponed for over 40 minutes in Miami . Suspended: The players were taken off the pitch after 22 minutes due to a storm in the area . It . was bizarre afternoon. Florida state safety regulations mean that . sports events have to be stopped if there is any danger of lightning . strike. So when a dramatic bolt of lightning cracked overhead of the Sun . Life Stadium in Miami last night, referee Ricardo Salazar had seen . enough. Exactly half way through the first half off the teams trudged; . and off they stayed for 44 minutes until the storm had passed. Nevertheless, . amidst the rain, that even had the watching David Beckham scurrying for . cover, something did emerge: England’s team to face Italy in Manaus . next week. Of course, Raheem Sterling was never going to play here, . after being suspended for his red card against Ecuador.  Nevertheless, . Welbeck and Lallana, with specific tasks to track back and harry . opposition midfielders, looks increasingly like the chosen ones for the . World Cup kick off. And at . least in some respect, the preparations were perfect. The England camp . were delighted with the 60 per cent humidity and 30 degree heat. The . heat – ‘worse the Manaus’ said an English official happily – was truly . excruciating. This at least would prepare England for their Amazonian . trek next weekend. Safety first: The delay had threatened to abandon the game, but the players returned shortly before 6pm local time . Walk and talk: England manager Roy Hodgson and captain Steven Gerrard leave the pitch . And, . amidst the kicking match, there were moments of promise, even if . ultimately England failed to break down ten men. Foremost was the . fluidity of the front four – Wayne Rooney, Welbeck, Sturrdige and . Lallana – rotating their positons regularly. Indeed, just prior to the . unexpected break, a delightful exchange between Rooney and Welbeck down . the right – both in areas away from their allotted positions – saw . Rooney cross and Welbeck dummy to play in Sturridge. The Liverpool . striker moved his body well to get into shooting range but pulled his . shot wide. On the bench, Hodgson grimaced in frustration; his side . should have been ahead. That . was the last action for almost an hour, the sides trooping off as the . storm closed in. When they re-emerged, Honduras looked more ready for a . fight than a match. Tackles began flying in, Palacios earning a yellow . card, for a chop at Gerrard. His team-mates then joined in . enthusiastically, Emilio Izaguirre, hacking at Sturridge’s ankles and . then kicking the ball into him as he lay on the ground. He received a . yellow card but it should certainly have been red. Fiery: Emilio Izaguirre brings down Sturridge and then kicks the ball straight at him from inches away . Stand off: The England striker confronts Izaguirre after the incident . Leap: Carlos Costly rises above Wayne Rooney to head towards goal . Alarmed, . Hodgson withdrew Gerrard and Rooney at half time for Jack Wilshere and . Ross Barkley but Honduras were not pacified. Victor Bernandez was booked . for a kick at Barkley and then Brayan Beckeles had another kick at . Welbeck on 51 minutes, for which he was also cautioned. England . retaliated, Lallana kickin out at Roger Espinoza’s knee on 61 minutes . and receive a booking. Beckeles the receivd a second yellow as was . dismissed for aiming his elbow at Leighton Baines on 66 minutes, with . Gary Cahill and Baines earning later yellow cards. It . was an indecently aggressive game, given both sides have a World Cup in . front of them. Wilshere and Barkley did at least bring fresh energy to . the proceedings in the second half, combining to play in the Evertonian, . when only a superb saving tackle from Izaguirre saved Honduras. Barkley . and Sturridge then interchanged passes to put in Lallana, whose dribble . ran out of control. Still, Sturridge managed to connect, forcing a . sharp save from Noel Valladares. Strike: Rooney unleashes an effort at goal from a free-kick from long range . On the move: England winger Adam Lallana takes on Celtic's Honduran defender Izaguirre . Plenty to ponder: Hodgson refused to confirm that his starting XI in Miami will be the team against Italy . Withdrawn: Rooney was taken off at half-time in Miami, as was captain Gerrard . Away . from the kicking match, Henderson was displaying fresh authority. He . grows with every match and as the senior partner in midfield in the . second half, he both directed play and his team-mates. Nevertheless, . even against ten men, England struggled to create genuine chances. The . one that should have settled the match came on 72 minutes. Glen . Johnson had pushed on well and found Sturridge, who, seven yards out . with just Valladares to beat, headed well over So frustrated was the . Liverpool man, he kicked the goalpost; inadvisable one week before your . World Cup starts. Still, England caught their flight to Rio De Janiero . last night with their team still in tact. For that at least they will be . thankful. ‘it’s time for the real thing now,’ said Hodgson. Indeed it . is. Impact: Ross Barkley impressed once again after coming off the bench at half-time .

Come the end of the opening 90-minute session it was Rosberg who led the way with a time of one minute 11.295secs, three seconds off the pace of Michael Schumacher's race lap record set in 2003. Hamilton, 22 points adrift of Rosberg in the drivers' standings in the wake of his retirement in Canada a fortnight ago when the German was second to debut race-winner Daniel Ricciardo, was 0.140secs adrift. Three other drivers also completed a lap under 72 seconds, led by the Ferrari of Fernando Alonso, followed by Felipe Massa in his Williams. Picture that: Formula One is making its return to Austria after an 11-year absence . Trail: Hamilton was slower than his team-mate in Friday's opening practice session . Jenson Button's McLaren, resplendent with a number of upgrades this weekend, fared strongly to claim fifth spot on the timesheet with a lap of 1:11.839secs. Force India's Sergio Perez was also in close attendance, less than three quarters of a second behind Rosberg, with team-mate Nico Hulkenberg and Williams' Valtteri Bottas also within a second of the on-song German. McLaren's Kevin Magnussen and Jean-Eric Vergne in his Toro Rosso completed the top 10, both marginally over a second down, along with Ferrari's Kimi Raikkonen and the second Toro Rosso of Daniil Kvyat.

Arriving for work: Formula One supremo Bernie Ecclestone in the Austrian GP paddock on Friday . Marussia's Max Chilton was 19th, 2.5secs adrift, with Sauber's Adrian Sutil and Caterham's Marcus Ericsson bringing up the rear, albeit with only nine and eight laps respectively to their name due to technical issues. As for Sebastian Vettel, it was another tough day in the cockpit of his Red Bull as the reigning four-times champion narrowly missed a smash into a barrier on the opposite side of the pit wall.Coming out of the final corner, Vettel caught the grass and twice spun through 360 degrees, avoiding the barrier by inches. Remarkably, the car ended up back on the circuit and pointing in the right direction, although Vettel finished the session down in 15th, 1.7secs off compatriot Rosberg.

"Parents of a woman who was viciously bashed and left for dead have made a desperate plea to find the culprit of the senseless act. Paul and Lesley, who want to withhold their surnames, discovered their daughter, Tonia, unconscious, brutally beaten and partially naked in her Lawson Place home in Munster, Perth on July 25. The 37-year-old, who could have been lying there for up to three days, is paralysed down her left side and completely blind. Scroll down for video . Tonia was so badly beaten that she has been left paralysed down her left side and completely blind . Tonia is a professional chef and had just started her own beef jerky business before she was viciously attacked . Her father, Paul, said there were no words to describe the heinous attack on his daughter . The doctors don't know if Tonia will ever recover full sight. 'Who could do this?' her father Paul asked. 'There are no words - it's very confronting.' 'Its just so horrific - a cowardly act has caused her now to not have much of a life anymore,' her mother Lesley added. Tonia was rushed to Royal Perth Hospital with bleeding on the brain and was in a coma for weeks - and doctors were forced to remove part of her skull. The assault is largely still a mystery but evidence indicates Tonia was hit on the head with a hard blunt object. Her memory has also been damaged as her parents have to often remind their daughter why she is crippled. Tonia is a professional chef and had just started her own beef jerky business before she was viciously attacked. She has a long road ahead of her and it is not known if she will ever fully recover.

"Phillip Schofield has revealed  he experienced hallucinations after losing weight on the 5:2 diet. The presenter of ITV’s This Morning says the strict regime enabled him to shed one and a half stone. He now weighs a trim 11 stone. But he said that there were side effects, having previously said he was struggling to adapt to the regime. Dangers: Phillip Schofield, pictured this week presenting on This Morning, has revealed that the 5.2 diet helped him shift a stone and a half but left him hallucinating . It allows men to consume only 600 . calories two days a week while eating  normally on other days. Schofield,  52, confessed on Alan Carr’s Chatty Man show on Channel 4: . ‘I have had hallucinations.’ The . presenter said he went on a  diet after he thought he looked ‘a bit . porky’ in a picture. ‘I wanted to be 11 stone,’ he said. ‘It took nine or ten months and now I am. My stomach is now so small I have hardly any appetite and can’t keep weight on.’ The 5:2 . diet involves limiting yourself to 500 calories a day (600 for . men) for two non-consecutive days per week and eating whatever you like . for the rest, and has been the year's most popular way of slimming down fast. It was the brainchild of Mimi Spencer and Michael Mosley and has . attracted celebrity fans including Benedict Cumberbatch and Miranda . Kerr - and it prided itself on helping people lose weight all while . improving blood pressure, cholesterol levels and insulin sensitivity. Weight loss: Phillip, 52, said he was feeling a bit 'porky' so decided to shift the pounds. He has gone from 12st in 2013, left, to 11st in less than ten months, right, pictured this week . Audience members were taken aback by his slim frame with one telling The Sun: 'His legs looked scarily thin. He didn't look right and people were saying he had lost too much weight.' Phillip isn't the only star to have suffered hallucinations as the result of a strict diet. Gwyneth Paltrow says she too was left 'hallucinating' after a 10-day cleanse. The . Iron Man 3 actress is known for being active and eating healthy, but . admits she has tried fads like juice cleanses in the past which did her . more harm than good. She . explained: 'I've done juice cleanses in the past, and in my twenties I . did the Master Cleanse, which left me hallucinating after 10 days. 'Be aware: a juice detox can crash your metabolism and lead to future weight gain,' she wrote in The Telegraph. More harm than good: Gwyneth Paltrow has criticised the cleansing trend in a new article she has penned . Katy Mason, Nutritionist at NutriCentre.com, said: 'Anxiety, blackouts (memory time loss), difficulty concentrating and hallucinations can have many different causes, and so it is always important to get such symptoms checked out by your doctor. 'However, in this case, Phillip Schofields' hallucinations would most likely be caused by low blood sugar levels from not eating enough. 'If he had not slept well the night before, had a late night, been drinking alcohol, consumed a lot of caffeine, was stressed or had recently exercised then the situation could be exasperated as these things can contribute to low blood sugar levels. 'When on the 5:2, it's really important to make sure you eat sensibly on the low calorie days, making sure your meal has a good ratio of protein to slow releasing carbohydrates.' British Dietetic Association spokesperson, Priya Tew, shared her views.... Pros: . 1. The 5:2 diet works as the 2 days of eating 500kcals mean that overall . you eat less calories. Eating less calories obviously favours weight . loss. 2. There is some evidence showing that this style of diet can work but . it is only a couple of studies and it is not long term evidence. Most . people want the weight to come off and stay off for good. We don't know . the long-term effects of the 5:2 diet yet. 3. Intermittent fasting may help improve insulin sensitivity although . more research is needed to back this up. 4. Fasting can lead to you being more in touch with your hunger cues and responding to them more appropriately. Cons: . 1. The fasting days can lead to lower energy, poor mood and . concentration and a preoccupation with food as well as problems sleeping . on fast nights. So you end up not able to eat much but constantly . wanting to and being grumpy and tired about it! Exercising on these . fasting days can be very difficult. 2. You can eat a completely unbalanced diet and end up with a poor . nutritional intake as this diet focuses on calories and not getting the . right nutrition and balance. In the long-term, eating an unbalanced diet . can increase the health risks of chronic disease. For example focusing . on eating 5 or more portion of fruit and vegetables, including . wholegrains in your diet and having 3 portions of calcium foods per day . are important nutritionally but are not considered in an intermittent . fasting diet. 3. Although the 5:2 diet is meant to be a long-term solution, for most . people it isn't a sustainable way to eat and it takes a lot of . discipline. For long term weight loss, long-term lifestyle changes are . needed. The risk with this diet is that people lose the weight, then . find they cannot stick to the fasting principles and put it all back on . again. Yo-yo dieting has been shown to be detrimental and can lead to . the weight creeping up over the years.","Phillip, 52, said he was feeling 'porky' so started the 5:2 .

"Did you see those photographs of all the black London taxis blocking a bridge over the River Thames as the drivers protested about a phone app for ordering cabs on line robbing them of business? Notice anything? Not one of them had an England flag flying from its window. Those red and white standards used to be the first sign of World Cup fever in our country. Not flying the flag: The Union Flag flies on The Mall but the Cross of St George is nowhere to be seen on the taxis . As soon as you stepped into one of those taxis the driver would ask you what you thought of England's chances. Most of them were bullish about reaching at least the semi-finals. Not at the moment. In fact, I did not see a single England flag on a black taxi before boarding a flight to Brazil, with the first game against Italy in Manaus barely two days away. Nor an Uber-app or any other mini-cab come to that. Neither have I chanced upon any in the streets of central London. As for the shops, not a glimmer of patriotic paraphernalia. And at stores like Marks & Spencer, which used to be brimming with all manner of England and general football memorabilia before and during World Cups past, are devoid of so much as a key ring. Never mind coffee mugs and tea towels. As I passed through Terminal 5 at Heathrow Airport... not a flag in sight. Nor a single England shirt. Nor do you see many on the buses, the London Underground or on the pavements. At a guess, replica kit sales are well short of the usual. It is estimated that fewer England fans are heading for Brazil than for any World Cup since Chile in 1962. The distance and the cost may have something to do with that but the England lads on tour used to save up for four years, dip into their overdrafts and get there somehow. The crazy, gung-ho optimism of so many of these tournaments was wildly misplaced and perhaps the fans have largely given up hope. But the gloom and doom is uncharacteristic of us as a nation. Where has all the John Bull-ishness gone? Roy Hodgson has a young team full of hope. They may not win but I for one give them a 50-50 chance of getting out of the group - at Italy's expense by the way - and reaching their par for the World Cup course: the quarter finals. A bit of World Cup fervour? A taxi driver waves a replica World Cup during the protest against 'Uber' The TV companies, desperate to build viewership in return for their World Cup investment, have scoured the land for signs of England fervour. They have filmed some pubs decked out in red and white regalia and the odd street bedecked with bunting. But they are hard to find, as are invitations to street parties. Perhaps my low-key London experience reflects more on the capital itself, with its rising proportion of immigrants and its political and social life dominated by a metropolitan elite whose snobbishness would be discomfited by displays of common enthusiasm. But the taxi drivers? Most of them are good old London boys. If they have lost the faith, hopefully Wayne Rooney and Co will at least do enough in Brazil to win them back. Difficult to find: This house in Bristol is decked out in red and white but it is in the minority . A publication* now on the book stands comes as a poignant reminder of when England ruled the game it gave to the world - but also how long it is since that solitary triumph. Veteran World Cup reporter David Miller has re-published his tome every four years since Bobby Moore led the boys of summer '66 to our only World Cup. Sadly, although Miller brings the broader World Cup story skillfully up to date, he has not yet had any need to change its title: England's Last Glory. Foreword thinking: Sir Geoff Hurst (left, celebrating in 1966), writes in David Miller's updated book . 'Hopefully I will have to do that before my time is up.' he says. On this occasion he has to settle for a very good foreword by the only man to have scored a hat-trick in a World Cup Final, our own Sir Geoff Hurst. *England's Last Glory, by David Miller, Pavilion £8.99 .","Wayne Rooney and Co need to win back the fans .

"A teacher who sent a former pupil a topless ‘selfie’ has been banned from classrooms for at least five years. Linda Harvey, 43, started contacting the 16-year-old boy on Facebook shortly after he left Park High School, in Colne, Lancashire, in July 2012. The pair then exchanged phone numbers and began sending personal text messages and pictures to each other, the National College for Teaching and Leadership heard. Mrs Harvey was reported to the school after sending an image of herself ‘bare-breasted’ from the neck down in November 2012. She resigned from her post before a formal disciplinary hearing took place at the school. Linda Harvey, 43, contacted former pupil of Park High School in Colne, Lancashire, where she was a teacher . But Mrs Harvey, who had worked at the school since 2002, has now been banned from teaching indefinitely after a Professional Conduct Panel found her actions amounted to ‘unacceptable professional conduct’ and ‘conduct that may bring the profession into disrepute’. The teacher admitted failing to maintain professional boundaries with her former student, referred to as Pupil A. In a statement to the NCTL panel, she said: ‘[I would] like to apologise for any upset and distress caused to the ex-pupil who I let down badly throughout the entire incident. ‘Above all it is the impact on him that I am mindful on - as well as the impact on other pupils and the school community as a whole.’ Alison Walsh, chairing the NCTL panel, said her actions were an ‘abuse’ of her ‘position of trust’. She said: ‘Although the actions occurred after Pupil A had left the school, they involved misconduct in the education setting because the relationship was initiated by Mrs Harvey in her capacity as Pupil A’s teacher. ‘The fact that details of the Facebook and text messages quickly became common knowledge serves to damage public perception of Mrs Harvey and the teaching profession. The National College for Teaching and Leadership, where Linda Harvey received a five year ban from teaching . ‘Teachers have a uniquely influential role and pupils and the public must be able to view teachers as role models in the way they behave.’ But Mrs Harvey - who became a teacher in 2009 after working as a teaching assistant - was cleared of ‘sexually motivated conduct’ after the panel found she had not intended to start an intimate relationship with the boy. The NCTL panel recommended to the Secretary of State for Education that Mrs Harvey should be barred from teaching for at least five years. The decision maker on behalf of Nicky Morgan, Paul Heathcote said: ‘Whilst not sexually motivated, Mrs Harvey’s behaviour, and in particular her failure to maintain appropriate boundaries, falls well short of the standards expected and I agree that a prohibition order is a proportionate sanction. ‘Mrs Harvey has shown significant insight and genuine remorse. She has been honest about her behaviour both during the investigation of this case and also with her current employers. ‘I agree with the panel’s recommendation that she should be allowed to apply to have the order set aside after a period of five years has elapsed. ‘This means that Mrs Linda Harvey is prohibited from teaching indefinitely and cannot teach in any school, sixth form college, relevant youth accommodation or children’s home in England. 'She may apply for the Prohibition Order to be set aside, but not until 7 September 2019, five years from the date of this order at the earliest.’","Linda Harvey, 43, started contacting the boy on Facebook after he left Park High School in Colne, Lancashire .

"Posting this photo on Facebook, Fatima said the man had attacked her as she went on a Sunday run through her local park in Guadalajara . A woman who snapped photo of a sex attacker who chased her as she took a Sunday run has put the picture on Facebook. Fatima Guzman, 32, hopes that by posting the picture on social media she will be able to to  track the man down and give his name to the police. The mother was jogging through her local park in her home town of Guadalajara in the state of Jalisco, in central Mexico, when she spotted the man hiding in a bush and watching her. But as she ran past he gave chase. Luckily the man was wrestled to the ground by passersby who heard Fatima's screams. Fatima said: 'I was screaming like a maniac as he tried touching me and thank God there were people nearby. 'One man grabbed him and I took a photo of him with my phone and demanded to know his name so I could report him. 'But he refused to tell me and then he managed to break free and run off.' Refusing to let the issue go and concerned for the safety of other women, Fatima took to social media to try to track the man down. Posting his photo on Facebook, she asked anyone who recognized the man to get in contact with her so she could report him to the police. She wrote: 'I got a fright on Sunday while running in the park near my house.

Luiz Felipe Scolari has faced Mexico once before at the World Cup. It was in charge of Portugal in the 2006 edition. His side won 2-1 in the group stages.
Neymar has scored 33 goals in only 50 appearances for Brazil and has six in his last four appearances for the Seleção.
Brazil have lost just one of their 34 World Cup matches in the first round/group stages of the World Cup since 1970 (W27 D6) – this came in a 1-2 defeat by Norway in their final group game of 1998 (but they had already qualified for the next stage).
The Seleção are now unbeaten in 38 successive matches in Brazil, with their last defeat coming against Paraguay (0-1in a friendly) in August 2002.
Oribe Peralta has scored nine goals in his last seven competitive appearances for Mexico, including the winner in the opening group stage game of this tournament."
"Jermaine Jenas faces another seven months on the sidelines after suffering a cruciate ligament injury during QPR's run towards promotion - but he is not letting that get him down as he distracted himself on a break in Marbella with his wife Ellie. The QPR midfielder was seen enjoying the sun with Ellie - who he has one daughter with - at the Ocean Club in the Spanish town. Wearing a leg support, Jenas, 31, relaxed on one of the sun loungers while he watched his wife potter around. Chilling out: Footballer Jermaine Jenas enjoys a holiday with wife Ellie in Marbella . Relaxing: The QPR midfielder sat with his wife on sun lounger at Ocean Club on Thursday . The 31-year-old former England international suffered a cruciate ligament injury in April, and it is likely he may need to have surgery on his leg. This could mean the footballer, who made 28 appearances for Queens Park Rangers this season, will be ruled out for the rest of the year. He's out: Jenas won't be playing football for a while after damaging his cruciate ligament . She'll be there: No doubt Ellie will be enjoying seeing her husband more that he is ruled out of training until what could be the end of the year . Hot mama: Ellie and Jermaine have one daughter together called Geneva . ‘JJ has completely ruptured his anterior cruciate ligament in his right knee,’ QPR medical chief, Peter Florida said: ‘We'll be taking him to see a specialist later this week to decide the next course of action. ‘At this stage it would appear he'll require a full repair, which is likely to keep him out for between six to nine months.’ Florida added: ‘JJ is in fairly good spirits all considering. He's been unlucky throughout his career with injuries, but he's in a positive frame of mind. Unfortunately he's just one of these very unlucky players when it comes to injuries.’ Still modelling? Ellie was once the face and body of Katie Price's clothing range Day 22 . Sad times: No doubt the 31-year old is hoping this injury won't end his career . In the meantime, Jermaine has been putting his football skills to good use by throwing himself behind a training programme at Burlington Danes Academy in White City. Before his Spanish trip, Jenas spoke to a group of students before a QPR coach put them through their paces in an hour-long session. The summer scheme is designed to improve a pupil’s football skill and academic performance. ‘I’m really pleased to be working with the staff and pupils at Burlington Danes. All of us at QPR have a great relationship with the school and are proud to support our local schoolchildren,’ said Jenas, set up, Aquinas Education, a supply teaching agency in his hometown of Nottingham.

"Roy Hodgson defended Wayne Rooney's performance as the England striker came under criticism again after a World Cup performance. Rooney, who has never scored in three World Cups, endured a frustrating game at times though he laid on England's goal with a great cross for Daniel Sturridge starting on the left and then playing on the right in the second half before going centrally for the final quarter of the game. Tough time: England's Wayne Rooney shows his frustration during Italy game . Hodgson said: 'We wanted to get Raheem Sterling around because of his agility and of course that meant moving Wayne Rooney and I thought that worked well, He set up the goal for us, he worked very hard and did well also when we brought him back into the centre. There's always going to be one player who there's a big debate around but I think it's very harsh to criticise Rooney's performance today because for me he played.' Hodgson did concede that Rooney and Leighton Baines had been exposed in the first half by the attacks of the runs of right back Matteo Darmian and significantly Danny Welbeck was moved to the left in the second half to cover him. 'We did struggle in the first half there . in particular but I think much less in the second half, although we got . caught upfield for the goal,' he said. Match facts: Wayne Rooney set up England equaliser (left) but only touched the ball twice in Italy penalty area . 'You can't recover when you go forward as much as we do. We got forward as well but his fun forward helped produce the cross that got them the winning goal.' Despite the defeat Hodgson singled out his young attacking players for praise. 'I thought all the young players did well. I thought Sturridge had an exceptional time until he got the dead leg. I thought Sterling was as bright as we thought he would be. 'I thought Barkley when he came on did some very good things. I thought Wilshere was showing all the right intentions. And of course we know what Danny Welbeck can give us. None of those players let me down today. They all did what we were hoping – except score an equalising goal.' High and wide: England striker Wayne Rooney fires a shot over the bar against Italy . Hodgson confirmed that physio Gary Lewin will have to return home, with Steve Kemp taking over responsibilities, after dislocating his ankle in the celebrations for England's goal. He said: 'It's very sad. He jumped up and landed on a water bottle. He's been taken to hospital. It was very, very painful. The doctor was able to set it at the side of the field but it's the end of the world cup for Gary and a sad moment for him and the team.'","Rooney started on the left and then moved to the right .

"Spain are one of my favourites to win the World Cup, but I fear they’ll suffer from fatigue. The players have been competing at the highest level in Europe — to the end of the Champions League, the Europa League and the Spanish League, which went to the wire with Atletico Madrid, Barcelona and Real Madrid. The players are exhausted and repeating those performance levels against the best players in the world will not be easy. Most of their build-up has been about recuperation and repair. Running out of steam? Spain's players might be tired after a gruelling season for their club sides . Holland’s coach Louis van Gaal has already stated his intent by declaring Spain’s quality is such that he will have to play with five across the back. Spain will need a more concentrated effort to break through and guard against Van Gaal’s counter-attack plans. Some critics have questioned whether Spain are ageing, or on the wane, but I don’t see that at all. My friend Vicente Del Bosque has a squad that knows Spain’s system. It means that, even if Xavi or Andres Iniesta grow tired, the likes of David Silva or Juan Mata know exactly what is required. I have the feeling that Silva, as he has already shown in Manchester City’s colours, could be key to opening up more than one tight defence. I see Spain and Brazil as the favourites, but it is difficult not to consider Argentina, especially in South America. And, if they click, Belgium — who have a lot of very talented players — will be the dark horses.

"Roy Hodgson has hinted that Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain will not be risked against Uruguay in England's potentially decisive World Cup Group D clash on Thursday. The Arsenal forward had impressed during England's final warm-up games before a knee injury suffered against Ecuador almost ended his World Cup hopes. Although Oxlade-Chamberlain was eventually included in the 23-man squad and has been recovering well, Hodgson has confirmed he is unlikely to use him against Uruguay. Sorry son! Roy Hodgson has confirmed Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain will not be used against Uruguay . On the mend: The Arsenal forward will resume training with the squad and could feature against Costa Rica . Lonely game: Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain spent his last day training as an individual in Sao Paulo . 'He is not in contention for tomorrow, but he will take part in the next four training sessions,' Hodgson said of his only injury concern. 'Today was his last training session as, if you like, an individual. 'At the minute, we could have taken a chance with him tomorrow, but it would be much better if he uses the four days after this game and before the Costa Rica game to train with the team. 'Fortunately for us, his actual injury has responded really well to treatment but I don't think we will put him into the firing line tomorrow before he has had some training sessions with the team.'

'I was . satisfied with his performance against Italy. Stats said ran more than any England . player, had more sprints than any other. 'Wayne is one of our three players with World Cup and Europen Championship experience with 100 caps, or nearly in Wayne’s case, and they have to . expect the focus is on them. 'The good thing is that Wayne more than happy to do . that. If he plays, I hope you’ll see that in his performance.' High spirits: England players share a joke ahead of what could be the defining game of their World Cup . England face being eliminated from the World Cup should they lose to Uruguay and Italy draw with Costa Rica. However, Hodgson is confident they can still progress despite losing their opening game in Manaus. 'I am confident. It’s three important games, each stands alone. 'We’ve had the first and we’ve analysed the good and the bad from it. We’ve definitely got it out of our system and we’re focused on tomorrow. It will be a good game against a very good team. We always knew more than two contenders in this group,' he said. Red hot! Daniel Sturridge is likley to be asked to lead England's line again after scoring in the defeat to England . Of Thursday's opponents, Hodgson conceded the strength of their team and emphasised how important a part England's defence will have to play to deny their talented forwards. 'They have two absolutely top class forwards in Luis Suarez and Edinson Cavani and a third in Diego Forlan,' said the England manager. 'They have very talented midfielders also, especially Rodriguez and they’re strong at set-plays and very experienced. Add them together and it’s a strong team. 'They must be disappointed with opening game but like us that’s in the past. We expect to see Uruguay with their big guns blazing.

"Roy Hodgson will attempt to persuade Steven Gerrard to continue his international career until 2016 - leaving the England captain with a hard choice between the needs of club and country, with Liverpool playing in the Champions League next season. Though Gerrard, 34, has struggled at times at the World Cup, the value to the squad of his experience means that Hodgson would want him to continue, given that so many youngsters are emerging in the team. With Frank Lampard about to retire from international football, Gerrard is one of the few senior pros left and England will not want to lose him as he provides a degree of balance to the youthful enthusiasm of the squad. VIDEO Scroll down for Captain Steven Gerrard leads England training session in Rio . Will you stay, Stevie? Hodgson is hoping he will not lose Gerrard to international retirement just yet . Friend or foe: Luis Suarez offers his commiserations to Gerrard after more international disappointment . However, Gerrard will consider the needs of his club, who have a much heavier fixture schedule next season after qualifying for the Champions League. Gerrard has said he will make his decision only after speaking to his friends, family and Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers after the World Cup. Rodgers’s views will be important — and it seems likely the Liverpool manager and the club’s medical staff would prefer Gerrard to use international breaks as rest weeks. Given Hodgson’s desire to keep Gerrard, the captain is expected to win his 114th cap in the dead-rubber match against Costa Rica on Tuesday. Even though the FA chairman Greg Dyke has guaranteed Hodgson a job until 2016 despite England’s exit, three defeats at the World Cup would damage the manager’s credibility further, so it remains a vital game. Ouch: Gerrard can only watch on as the Uruguay players celebrate Suarez's decisive goal that defeated England . End of the world: But Gerrard could be back again for another shot at glory with England at Euro 2016 . Given Costa Rica’s wins over Uruguay and Italy, Hodgson seems likely to adjust the tactics that have seen England exposed defensively — losing the game would bring further humiliation. If that is the case,  England could revert to a more conservative 4-3-3 formation with Ross Barkley and Jordan Henderson ahead of Gerrard, Wayne Rooney up front and Daniel Sturridge and Adam Lallana wide. That would give England more bodies in midfield where they have struggled against both Italy and Uruguay. England’s campaign is their worst at a World Cup finals since 1958, when they failed to get out of the group, though then they drew all three matches and finished joint second in their group.

"A former student at an exclusive New England boarding school in 1980s is claiming he was subjected to sex assaults by his headmaster and was gang raped. A federal lawsuit filed this week has reopened a decades-old sex abuse scandal at the exclusive Indian Mountain School in Connecticut. The suit was filed Oct. 6 in U.S. District Court by William Brewster Brownville, who attended the private boarding school in Salisbury in the 1980s. A federal lawsuit filed this week has reopened a decades-old sex abuse scandal at the exclusive Indian Mountain School in Connecticut (pictured) Headmaster Peter Carleton, pictured, allegedly used boys for his sexual pleasure, according to the lawsuit. The headmaster would show the boys porn, encourage them to masturbate with each other and assault them . It provides graphic details of what Brownville alleges was routine abuse of students at the hands of staff, including sex assaults by the now-deceased headmaster and gang rapes. The school at the time served students in grades five through nine. 'This was literally a nest of pedophiles operating in a community that allowed them unfettered and constant access to a never-ending stream of prepubescent and pubescent boys for their own sexual gratification,' said Anthony Ponvert, Brownville's attorney. Brownville, who Ponvert said has agreed to use his name in connection with the case, was among a group of boys chosen in 1986 as part of a rotation to live in the basement of headmaster Peter Carleton's home, where they were used for his sexual pleasure, according to the lawsuit. The headmaster would show the boys pornography, encourage them to masturbate with each other and sexually assault them. Christopher Simonds, an English teacher who has been the subject of other lawsuits against the school, engaged in similar behavior, showing Brownville and other boys pornography, sharing drugs with them and sexually abusing them, according to the lawsuit. Attempts to reach Simonds, who was fired from the school in 1985, were not successful on Thursday. A phone listed in his name was no longer in service. Carleton died in 1996. Brownville, who was between 13 and 16 years old at the time, also alleges he was gang raped by on several occasions by members of the school's maintenance department. The school's trustees and other teachers were aware of the abuse and in some cases witnessed some of it, according to the lawsuit. At parties, Carleton would discuss boys' bodies and his fascination with them, Ponvert said. Nobody currently working at the school was employed there when the abuse is said to have occurred, Mark Devey, the current head of school, said in an email Thursday. 'We have just seen the allegations and are shocked and disheartened by them,' he said. 'Because our first priority is to protect the health, safety, and well-being of the students here, it is deeply disturbing to learn that 30 years ago a student at IMS might have been abused. 'We are looking into these allegations and we take them very seriously.' The school, which according to its website has an endowment of about $9 million, settled five similar lawsuits in the 1990s. No criminal charges were ever filed. A 50-page police report filed in 1992 graphically detailed alleged abuse by Carleton and Simonds but concluded that the statute of limitations had expired. At the time, the investigators said school officials refused to provide them contact information for staff and students or explain why Simonds was fired. The lawsuit seeks unspecified damages. Ponvert said Brownville sued because he wants some accountability from the school, where current students pay $52,000 a year for tuition, room and board. 'Nobody has ever been punished or criminally charged as a result of this,' said Ponvert. 'Nobody has ever been outed, and many of them have gone on to other jobs and other careers that have put them in contact with other potential victims.' Ponvert said he's hopeful that Brownville's decision to go public will prompt other former students to come forward.","William Brownville alleges that boys were routinely and rampantly molested at the exclusive Indian Mountain School in Connecticut decades ago .

The slip against Chelsea and the giveaway header against Uruguay are sad memories for the 33-year-old, who will surely call it a day after this. VERDICT: OUT . End of days? At 34, chances are Steven Gerrard's England career could be coming to a close . Gary Cahill . Had a wonderful season alongside John Terry (remember him?) and is likely to be the senior central defender going forward despite being bettered by Mario Balotelli and Luis Suarez.  Needs to form a strong partnership with one of the young guns. At 28, he has another four-year cycle in him. VERDICT: IN . Battler: Gary Cahill was tussing with Luis Suarez all night aganst Uruguay . Phil Jagielka . Fronted up after the defeat against Uruguay and a wonderful servant to Everton but the time may have come for the central defender. Jagielka is 31 and was made to look it against world-class opposition. John Stones and Steve Caulker are waiting in the wings. VERDICT: OUT . Caught out: Phil Jagielka looked out of his depth at times, and should have done better for both goals . Jack Wilshere . When fit there is none better than the Arsenal star. He can occupy a holding role, a roving role, and a scoring role. Wilshere’s future will be defined by whether he can steer clear of the treatment table. No longer regarded as the answer to all England’s midfield problems thanks to the talent on offer. VERDICT: IN . Lacking impact: Jack Wilshere struggled in a short cameo against Italy, and remained on the bench throughout against Uruguay . Frank Lampard . The view from the bench must have been a frustrating one for Lampard, whose main role at this World Cup would be one of morale-booster and leader by example. The stalwart is 36 so whatever way you look at it, this is goodbye. VERDICT: OUT . Frustrating: Frank Lampard provides invaluable experience off the pitch, but failed to get on it in either game . Daniel Sturridge . Hard to believe that the Liverpool striker has come through such a gruelling domestic campaign. Looked fresh, acted as if he was delighted to be in Brazil and won over hearts and minds. Scored against Italy and was England’s most threatening player against Uruguay. Lovely celebration too. VERDICT: IN . Promising: Daniel Sturridge scored the leveller against Italy, but struggled to impose himself against Uruguay . Wayne Rooney . Broke his World Cup duck, provided the cross for Sturridge’s goal and ran a marathon but also missed too many chances. Survived the chop against Uruguay. Still England’s main striker but what happens next could come down to Louis van Gaal at United and how he deploys Robin van Persie. VERDICT: IN . Breakthrough: Wayne Rooney finally broke his World Cup duck against Uruguay, but it could have been so much more . Danny Welbeck . Someone needs to get inside the brain of the Manchester United striker. Roy Hodgson’s belief in him has not been justified and it appears Welbeck’s insistence he wants a central role is hindering his progress. Needs to start playing/scoring more regularly for United to get his place back. VERDICT: OUT . Energetic: Danny Welbeck provided plenty of running over the two games, but very little end product . Chris Smalling . Like Jones, has probably paid for United’s very disappointing season. Missed Euro 2012 through injury and has had niggling problems since. At the age of 24 Smalling can no longer be regarded as a kid and he may just have missed the boat. VERDICT: OUT . Action-less: Chris Smalling didn't see a minute of action during either game, but struggled during the warm-ups . Ben Foster . Always difficult for a second-choice goalkeeper. The West Brom player is 31 now and Roy Hodgson may feel it is time to bring in John Ruddy and Under-21 Jack Butland for the European Championships but Foster is a steady stand-by. VERDICT: IN . Backup: Ben Foster remains a solid alternative to number one Joe Hart . Jordan Henderson . Having . won over all his critics at Liverpool, the midfielder may have to do it all . over again for his country. Henderson worked his socks off in the two games but . was shown up by ‘old man’ Andrea Pirlo. Will continue to be a useful squad . member but team spot under pressure. VERDICT: IN . Work ethic: Jordan Henderson put in a decent shift alongside Gerrard in both games . Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain . Remember that fresh-faced Arsenal youngster from Euro 2012? Injuries have stalled the Ox but, at the age of 20, the winger still has time on his side. Will be competing with Arsenal team-mate Theo Walcott, not to mention England’s other young Lions. It could come down to character as well as class. VERDICT: IN . Cut short: Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain's knee injury kept him out of both England games, it now looks as though he won't have the chance to make an impact . VIDEO Uruguay elated as England sit on the brink . Phil Jones . The Manchester United defender is still only 22 but still has to live up to his potential. Not had a chance to shine in Brazil but Hodgson appears not to rate him highly enough to play either at right back or in central defence. Deserves another chance. VERDICT: IN . Step up: With question marks surrounding the defence, Phil Jones must take chance to prove himself . James Milner . Unfairly pilloried because successive England managers keep picking him but the wealth of attacking talent coming through means that the Manchester City utility man may well find himself sliding down the pecking order and right out of the international scene. Will keep fighting though. VERDICT: OUT . Redundant: With England not having a lead to defend, James Milner wasn't called upon for his trademark workrate . Rickie Lambert . It would be such a shame if this turned out to be a cameo tournament for the Liverpool striker but the omens are not good. Former Southampton team-mate Jay Rodriguez will be knocking on the door and Andy Carroll might start hitting form for West Ham. The 32-year-old may have had his day. VERDICT: OUT . Hard luck: Rickie Lambert deserved better than just a five minute 'Plan B' cameo against Uruguay . Raheem Sterling . Ah, that’s the problem with the kids. Sterling is a truly exciting young talent but as good as he was against Italy, the reverse was true against Uruguay. Think back to when he broke into the Liverpool team – Brendan Rodgers had to take him out again for a while. Still only 19 and a big prospect. VERDICT: IN . Light & shade: Raheem Sterling was superb against Italy, but anonymous versus Uruguay . Adam Lallana . In terms of age Lallana is not a baby but in terms of experience the 26-year-old is still wearing international L plates. He has not been given enough opportunity to show what he can do in Brazil and deserves another go on the big stage, especially if continues to shine in the Premier League. VERDICT: IN . Cameos: Adam Lallana came on in both games for England, but struggled to assert himself . Ross Barkley . There was a palpable sense of excitement when the Everton youngster came on as substitute against Uruguay. He ran at players and looked to do something different. It is tough being lauded as the next big thing in England football but Barkley looks like he can handle the hype. VERDICT: IN . Experience: Ross Barkley's time in Brazil will be invaluable for him going forward . Fraser Forster . If Foster thought he had a tough gig, spare a thought for Forster who was never going to get a game in a month of Sundays. If Foster stays then Forster is likely to be the one jettisoned for youth but it could easily go the other way. VERDICT: OUT . Third choice: Fraser Forster was never realistically going to get a game at the World Cup . Luke Shaw . The clamour for the Southampton teenager continues but whether the 18-year-old would have done any better against the canny Italians and the wily Uruguayans is open to debate. Continues to get better and better on the bench, however, and a big prospect for the future. VERDICT: IN . Successor: Despite not getting onto the pitch, Luke Shaw still seems the likely replacement for Ashley Cole . VIDEO Hodgson needs Italian miracle . Presuming Roy Hodgson is still coach in September for their opening Euro 2016 qualifying match away in Switzerland, the first names on his team-sheet are surely Hart, Sturridge, Cahill and Rooney. Wilshere taking the Gerrard role is an obvious one too but Henderson might come under pressure from Jones. Having Sturridge, Barkley and Sterling as an attacking trio behind Rooney means no Oxlade-Chamberlain, no Lallana. Easy isn’t it, Roy? Possible England starting line-up v Switzerland (4-2-3-1) Hart; Walker, Stones, Cahill, Shaw; Wilshere, Henderson; Sturridge, Barkley, Sterling; Rooney.","England 2-1 defeat to Uruguay and Costa Rica's win over Italy means Roy Hodgson's men are OUT .

"Clint Dempsey has revealed he is releasing a rap album after the World Cup. Dempsey, who scored after 31 seconds in USA's 2-1 win over Ghana on Monday, spent two weeks before the tournament recording a 13-track album in Los Angeles with the help of rappers and producers from his home town of Nacogdoches, Texas. The album will be called 'The Redux' and will be released under Dempsey's rap name 'Deuce'. VIDEO Scroll down for Dempsey and his US teammates on the way to Manaus for Portugal .

'We just were having fun with it and it ended up being an album,' Dempsey told the Wall Street Journal. On the album, Dempsey raps about his journey from rags to riches, being 'Captain America' and scoring goals – or, as he says, 'banging Gs'. This is not Dempsey's first foray into music having released a track before the 2006 World Cup called 'Dont Tread'. Fellow rapper and friend Mike Chehadé told the paper that Dempsey's skills are not to be sniffed at: He said: 'He’ll just call you sometimes and start . free-styling – he doesn’t even say hello … I’m not saying he’s Eminem, . but he’s definitely qualified.' He also said it could make the US team a more intimidating prospect at the World Cup. He added: 'We’re not known as a soccer powerhouse – we’re almost known for being soft. But Clint has this edge.'

"For just a moment it looked as if the brilliance that had earned Martin Kaymer a place in the record books at the halfway point of the 114th United States Open was about to unravel. Becoming the first man to open a major championship with two rounds of 65 suddenly appeared more than 24 hours ago. Now he was staring down a 15ft putt for a bogey at the fourth. Miss it and he would have been three over par at that early stage, and his six shot lead would have been halved after less than an hour’s play. Top dog: Martin Kaymer (right) takes a five shot lead going into the final round of the US Open on Sunday . Mixed bag: Kaymer shot a wobbly round of 72 at Pinehurst to be leading on eight-under-par overall . Sandy landing: Kaymer's indifferent round including landing in a greenside bunker on the tenth hole . Eyes on the prize: Kaymer is trying to become the first man to win a major with two opening rounds of 65 . What followed, though, proved the start of 15 minutes of sheer guts and class that kept the 29-year-old from Dusseldorf firmly on course to claim his second major championship, following his win in the USPGA in 2010. The putt, like so many over the first 36 holes, was drained, to be followed by an approach to the par five 5th that might well prove the shot of the championship. From the ‘native area’ just off the fairway to the left, Kaymer played a long iron so precise it pitched on the only sliver of green available for it to finish close to the flag, and he holed the ensuing six-footer for a fabulous eagle three. Drained: Erik Compton leads the chasing pack on three-under-par overall at Pinehurst . Comeback king: Compton (right) has had to deal with two heart transplants during his career . In the thick of it: Rickie Fowler (centre) is tied with Compton on the leaderboard going into the final round . There is still work to do today, though, thanks to the spirited efforts of Rickie Fowler and Erik Compton but Kaymer’s last shot of the third round looked significant. A fine approach was followed by a confident six foot birdie putt for a 72 that stretched his lead back to five shots going into the final round. ‘I didn’t play as well as I did the first two days but the pins were in more difficult positions as well,’ said Kaymer. ‘I’m obviously pleased with my position, but I know the tournament is far from won.’ Is there a more remarkable athlete in sport than Compton? There’s certainly not a more remarkable golfer. Don’t talk to the 34-year-old about adversity on the course. He’s known plenty off it after undergoing not one but two heart transplants but here he is, with a chance to win his national championship after a 67. Deposed champion: Justin Rose has admitted he will be handing over his US Open title this year . Fowler, who grew up idolising Payne Stewart who won here in 1999 and donned plus fours as a tribute on day one, is on the same three under par mark after a 67 of his own, while the dangerous Henrik Stenson will start six shots off the lead, alongside Dustin Johnson. Defending champion Justin Rose accepted he was handing the trophy after a round of 70. It’s been a decent defence nonetheless, although he was irritated by failing to get up and down on three occasions and staining his card with a three-putt. He was still the best of a disappointing UK challenge, though, in tied tenth spot with Rory McIlroy and Ian Poulter unable to get into contention following rounds of 74. Sheffield teenager Matt Fitzpatrick was another to suffer in the more difficult conditions as he ran up a 78 but today will be a memorable one for him regardless. His final day in the non-paid ranks will conclude with him being presented with the silver medal as low amateur. Frustrated figure: Rory McIlroy watches on as he misses a putt for birdie on the 12th green at Pinehurst . It completes quite a collection for the gilded 19-year-old, since he can place it next to a similar medal he won at the Open at Muirfield last year, and the trophy he collected for becoming England’s first US Amateur Champion for more than a century last August. And so the real world awaits, and it will be fascinating to see how the most feted British amateur since a tender Justin Rose in 1998 gets on. Rose, of course, earned similar status as the apple of the golfing world’s eye when he turned pro after finishing fourth at the Open at Royal Birkdale. He promptly went on a downward spiral that saw him miss 21 halfway cuts in a row. Cool customer: Swede Henrik Stenson is six shots behind Kaymer on two-under-par overall . So who better than Rose to consult about the pitfalls facing Fitzpatrick, in his attempts to justify the hype? The pair played together for the first two rounds here, and Rose was as impressed as anyone at the manner in which Fitzpatrick coped with the clamour of playing with Phil Mickelson to become the only amateur to make the halfway cut. ‘I have talked to Matt about what lies ahead and I hope he learns from my own experience because he’s a great lad and a wonderful player,’ said Rose. ‘It is very easy to get distracted thinking you need to get your European Tour card or your PGA Tour card or get your world ranking to such and such position. ‘When you do that you’re just heaping pressure on yourself and I’m sure Matt will not make that mistake. Turning pro is a huge step for anyone, though. I don’t think you’re ever 100 per cent ready because at the end of the day it is a process to get better year on year for the next 20 years for him. That’s what you have to focus on.’ Young gun: Matt Fitzpatrick will be presented with the silver medal as low amateur on Sunday . Fitzpatrick’s first event will be the Irish Open which starts on Thursday and may well prove a wise place to make his debut, since much of the spotlight will inevitably fall on returning heroes like Rory McIlroy and Graeme McDowell. First, though, the US Open presentation ceremony, where it looks for all the world like being an England-Germany affair.","Martin Kaymer has a five shot lead going into the final round of the US Open on Sunday .

"No sooner had Uruguay striker Luis Suarez condemned England's World Cup hopes than the internet does what it does best - come up with virals about the match.

"Andy Murray has been handed a relatively benign opening to his Wimbledon title defence with the draw proving more favourable than it initially looked twelve months ago. The 27 year-old Scot was handed a first round against Belgian David Goffin, the world number 104 who might be mistaken for being the member of a boy band. He is a talented ball striker but has made his biggest career impression on clay. Murray is in the same half as Novak Djokovic, who pulled out of an exhibition match to rest his troublesome wrist on Thursday, with Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal on the other side. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Andy Murray practising volleys at Wimbledon on court 4 . Champion: Andy Murray will start the defence of his Wimbledon title against Belgian David Goffin . The defending champion could have a major headache in the quarter finals where he might play last Sunday’s Aegon champion Grigor Dimitrov or the relentless Spanish scrapper David Ferrer. Murray’s first expected seed in the third round is Spanish baseliner Roberto Bautista Agut, although it couldbe the in-form German Tobias Kamke instead. His scheduled fourth round opponent could be tough, the big-serving South African Kevin Anderson but overall it could have come out worse. But he has managed to avoid some of the more nasty floating players in the early round, and may be pleased to have avoided his perennial semi-final nemesis Rafael Nadal before the final. Of course there is much to happen before then and the Spaniard, who flopped in last year’s first round, has an opener this time against Slovak Martin Klizan. Nadal has the nastiest looking draw of the KBig Four' with a possible second round against his 2012 conqueror Lukas Rosoi and maybe a meeting after that with the massive serving Croatian Ivo Karlovic. Focused: Rafael Nadal, who crashed out in last year's first round, will rake on Slovak Martin Klizan . VIDEO Djokovic pulls out of Wimbledon warm-up . 1R - Goffin 2R - Andujar/Rola 3R - Bautista Agut 4R - Fognini QF - Ferrer SF - Djokovic F - Nadal . Federer has a potentially nasty second round against the athletic Frenchman Julien Benetteau, who has caused him problems at Wimbledon before. Manchester’s Dan Smetihurst, one of four men in the draw making their Wimbledon debut, will play American giant John Isner. James Ward has a tough match against Russian number one Mikhail Youznhy while Dan Evans takes on another Russian, Andrey Kuznetsov. In the women’s draw the two favourites, Serena Williams and Maria Sharapova, could face each other in the quarter finals in what is a tough looking top half of the draw. It also includes Eugenie Bouchard taking on Daniela Hantuchova and Heather Watson tackling the talented young Croatian Ajla Tomljanovic.

Prandelli will also claim that his players are exhausted from a brutal training camp in Florence this week designed to duplicate the stifling heat of Manaus, where Italy and England will meet on June 14. But it was still a jolt for the Italians who had been in party mood from the moment Balotelli set up an early goal for Claudio Marchisio. ‘I’m not disappointed because I knew my team had worked a lot on their physical conditioning,’ said Prandelli. ‘We have based our operation to be ready for Brazil not now. We knew we might pay the price at some point. ‘My team will be ready in Brazil. We still have to work on a few details like freekicks and corners. You could see tonight that we were not ready on those sort of things. ‘I was not very happy with my team playing too many long balls as well. We need to work on that.

Downcast: Balotelli trudges off after being substituted by Italy coach Cesare Prandelli . ‘We should have scored a second goal to kill it off but we didn’t and we have to learn from that.’ Asked . if he could take any heart from England’s draw against Ecuador in . Miami, Prandelli replied: ‘The results before the World Cup don’t matter . because those are friendly games and we saw that tonight. You don’t . have to give too much significance to these results.’ The surprise . draw also added to a difficult week for Prandelli who has been forced to . defend his decision to pick striker Lorenzo Insigne, scorer of just . three Serie A goals for Napoli last season, in his 23-man squad instead . of Giuseppe Rossi and Mattia Destro. The broken leg suffered by . Riccardo Montolivo in Italy’s previous friendly against the Republic of . Ireland also meant Prandelli had to experiment by partnering Andrea .

"You want to hate him, you really do. There’s the biting, the diving and the casual racism. And even last night there was that ridiculous sense of nurturing a grievances against England, as though he were a perpetual victim. ‘Before the game too many people in England laughed about my attitude over the last few years,’ said Luis Suarez. ‘This is a very good time for me. I want to see what they think now.’VIDEO Scroll down to see Suarez thank wife and kids in emotional dressing room video . Admiration: Luis Suarez's decimation of England was nothing short of spectacular . VIDEO Luis Suarez in devastating form .

Composure: And he took advantage of some sloppy defending to break Three lions hearts late on . Of course, it was ridiculous given that he was just been voted Footballer of the Year by both English players and journalists. It seems that Suarez wants nothing but unconditional praise, however he behaves. Yet despite all of those reasons to dislike him, it’s impossible not to admire Suarez. Like Diego Maradona, there may be legitimate reasons not to want him to become a role model for your children. But as a footballer, he is throwback to the how you wished you could play the game as a child. Maradona was never quite just a one-man team in 1986. There were very good players around him in the likes of Jorge Valdano and Jorge Burruchuga. Nevertheless, it is true that without Maradona it is impossible that Argentina would have won the World Cup. Likewise, last night it wasn’t all about Suarez. Edinson Cavani had an excellent game, the perfection of his cross for Suarez’s first goal will live long in the memory; Egidio Arevalo held the midfield together, snuffing out threats when they emerged; and Nicolas Lodeiro, until he went off, was a pest, irritating Gary Cahill and Phil Jagielka with his incessant pressing. And yet at times it felt like one man taking on England on his own. No-one will dispute that Suarez was the difference between the teams. Superb: Edinson Cavani also had an excellent game, teeing up Suarez's first goal with a pinpoint cross . Harrier: And Nicolas Lodeiro was a pest to England all night . And his passion, his determination to play despite his injury and the sheer joy of scoring against England represent something important about international football. That feeling is hard to replicate when playing for a club. It is the burden of symbolically leading a nation in a game of football that brings that degree of intensity and emotional release. His extraordinary wide-eyed and ecstatic look when he scored is the reason why football was invented. It distilled the joy and aggression that the sport is able to produce in a single moment of skill. It is likely that the misjudged grievances he holds against the English fuelled his performance. It certainly did Maradona in 1986. In a wildly inappropriate language, he described the 1986 World Cup win over England as revenge for the Argentine defeat in the 1982 Falklands War. ‘It was as if we had beaten a country, not just a football team,’ wrote Maradona in his autobiography about that game. ‘Although we had said before the game that football had nothing to do with the Malvinas (Falklands) war, we knew they had killed a lot of Argentine boys there, killed them like little birds. And this was revenge.’ Heralded: Despite his belief otherwise, Suarez has received great plaudits for his play in England . Hand of God: Diego Maradona of Argentina scoring his infamous goal against England during Mexico '86 . Suarez’s misguided sense of injustice is not as outlandish as that but it is still very silly. But however foolish his motives, the performance remains phenomenal. And once the disappointment of losing has passed, that is what we will remember from this game. The striker’s display represented the best of international football last night. He led his national team in every sense, through his attitude to the game, with his constant cajoling of his team and by scoring his goals. And when a truly great player does that and when it clearly means so much to him, it is difficult not to be impressed and moved, for that is football at its purest. What Luis Suarez did last night will live with us for many years. And just like Maradona’s goal in 1986 - the second one, that is - one day we will be able to celebrate that.","Suarez's two-goal decimation of England has to be admired .

"England's World Cup stars are set to be greeted with a playing surface not befitting the occasion when they face Italy in their Group D opener on Saturday. Pictures of the Amazonia Arena, where Roy Hodgson's side will face their European counterparts in just three days, emerged on Wednesday. The pitch, in the heat of Manaus, appeared to be in a poor condition with noticeable dry patches on the turf, particularly bare around one of the goals.

"World Cup TV host Gary Lineker said more in hope than expectation on the eve of Brazil 2014 that its biggest stars had to deliver. He was well aware the most-hyped players in South Africa four years ago - Lionel Messi, Cristiano Ronaldo, Wayne Rooney, Kaka, Fernando Torres and Robin van Persie - managed just two goals between them, and the entire World Cup had flopped as a result. But, to the delight of Lineker and millions of armchair fans, this time has already been different – and how. VIDEO All Star XI: Ronaldo . Biggest stage: Lionel Messi celebrating his goal that crucially put Argentina 2-0 up against Bosnia & Herzegovina at the Maracana on Sunday . Clincher: Mario Balotelli netting the header that gave Italy a 2-1 victory over England on Saturday . Local hero: Neymar celebrates with Brazil team-mate Hernanes after scoring the penalty that gave his side a 2-1 lead in the World cup opener against Croatia on Thursday . Time to shine: Now it is Cristiano Ronaldo's turn to deliver as Portugal prepare to face Germany . The greatest players in the world have set the stage alight in the first few days with brilliant goals from Neymar, Karim Benzema, Mario Balotelli, Messi, van Persie, Arjen Robben, and a midfield masterclass from Andrea Pirlo as Italy broke passing records against England. If anything is going to get the current best player on the planet Cristiano Ronaldo in the mood as he makes his long-awaited first appearance in Brazil against Germany on Monday evening, it’ll be the sight of his peers getting so much acclaim and adulation in a stunning start to the tournament. For all the talk of Messi’s attempts to emulate Diego Maradona this summer, Ronaldo has the ego to believe he should leave Brazil this summer as the greatest player of all-time by leading Portugal to their first World Cup – something even Eusebio couldn’t manage. He’s had to overcome a torn thigh muscle and tendonitis in his knee in the build-up to the World Cup, in less than four weeks after helping Real Madrid win the Champions League. But surely nothing will stop the £80million world footballer of the year trying to put on a special show in Portugal’s opening game in Group G against Germany in Salvador. Ronaldo was actually applauded into the media room as he finally arrived an hour late on Sunday to talk about the Germany clash. He tried to be modest but it didn’t really work. Finisher: Karim Benzema scored two as France beat Honduras in their opening game on Sunday . The Flying Dutchman: Robin van Persie netted a brace as Netherlands beat Spain 5-1 . Sprinter: Arjen Robben was also amongst the goals in their demolition of the world champions . ‘I'm 100%,’ he assured them. ‘I'd like to be at 110%. If I'm not feeling well, I'm the first to tell the coach I can't play. If I feel anything during the match, I'm the first to tell the coach. I come first. ‘I can make a difference, but I can't carry the whole team. I just want to help. On Monday we have a match against a favourite to win the World Cup, Germany. 'Look at my statistics and my CV – I have nothing to prove. My career has been great so far and I just want that to continue.’ Until now the game’s biggest names haven’t let the World Cup down. It started on opening night when Brazil’s No10 Neymar rescued the hosts after they trailed to Croatia, equalising with a shot that fizzed in-off the post and then scoring a match-winning penalty. Struggle: Ronaldo and Messi had a difficult time of it at the last World Cup, with the Portuguese forward managing just a single goal against North Korea and the Argentine failing to score . Strife: Wayne Rooney had a terrible time of it in South Africa, failing to score in four appearances, whilst Kaka saw more red cards for Brazil than he managed goals . If that was impressive, what Robben and van Persie did to holders Spain on Friday was nothing short of sensational. They scored twice each – van Persie’s looped header will be talked about for years to come – as Holland won 5-1. Over the weekend, it was more of the same. Mario Balotelli headed Italy’s winning goal against England – why is it always him? At 35, Pirlo was man-of-the-match as Italy recorded a pass completion rate of 93.2 per cent, the highest ever in a modern World Cup game. Benzema scored twice for France, and then Messi lit up the Maracana after a sluggish start with a tradsemark solo  slalom to score against Bosnia and Herzegovina in Argentina’s 2-1 victory. Pass master: Andrea Pirlo recorded a pass completion rate of 93.2 per cent against England . All smiles: Ronaldo was in high spirits during a press conference ahead of the crucial opening game . Expectation: But he knows there will be real pressure on him to deliver the goods . It will be extremely difficult to top – but it’s Ronaldo up next and anything is possible. He's the most expensive footballer in the world at £80million. He's the current world footballer of the year, ahead of Messi. But taking the World Cup by storm would top it all and he knows it, regardless of the state of his body.","Messi, Balotelli and Neymar have all delivered so far at the World Cup .

"Former Chelsea manager Avram Grant is here in Brazil as co-commentator for Israel TV station Channel One. He covered Uruguay’s opening game against Costa Rica last week and here is his guide to England’s next opponents. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Steven Gerrard say England will go on the attack again . Threat: Daniel Sturridge can do damage with his pace . Speed demon: Danny Welbeck can hurt the Uruguayans . Overall impression . In terms of personnel, Uruguay have changed very little from the team that reached the semi-finals of the last World Cup. Nine of the players who started against Holland in Cape Town were on the field when they met Costa Rica. But, oh, what a difference. Not in one area of the pitch did Uruguay play well in this game. It seems because they are older many of them are now slower. Forlan and Lugano are not the players they were, for sure. England can win this game. They just need to be conscious of certain things. Beware the counter-attack . Danger men: Diego Forlan and Luis Suarez (pictured), along with Edinson Cavani will pose Uruguay's threat . This is where Uruguay are at their most dangerous, and it is how they like to play. Particularly up front where Suarez, Cavani and Forlan enjoy playing in the space which that kind of approach gives them. I think they prefer to go into games as the underdogs. Because they were expected to beat Costa Rica, I think the situation got the better of them. VIDEO All Star XI: Luis Suarez . Pace is the key . If the England team that is being discussed is the one Roy Hodgson opts for then they will boast one of the quickest attacks in the tournament. Welbeck and Sterling on the wings, Rooney behind Sturridge; this is a forward line that can inflict real damage against Uruguay. Secret to success: Raheem Sterling and Wayne Rooney can hurt Uruguay . They need to look at how Joel Campbell destroyed them. I told Arsene Wenger that Campbell played very well; he should be back at Arsenal for next season. Fucile, who is set to come in for the suspended Maxi Pereira, has been struggling with injury. Sterling and Welbeck need to have confidence to run at the full-backs. Midfield battle zone . This is where Uruguay were most disappointing. Arelavo Rios and Gargano were very poor indeed. They created nothing. It was like they didn’t want the ball. Personally, and I will be accused of Chelsea bias here, I would be tempted to play Lampard with Gerrard against them. Then you would have two players who could play those balls behind them. Even so, I believe England can dominate this area of the field. Going with experience: Frank Lampard should come into England's engine room . England’s defence . This tournament has interested me because so many teams are playing three at the back. Holland, Mexico, Costa Rica and Argentina. Juventus played this way too in winning the Italian title this year. As did Brazil when they won the World Cup in 2002. Although they had two great full-backs in Roberto Carlos and Cafu back then! The English defence is a bit of a worry for me. Personally, I may have taken John Terry and Ashley Cole. So Cahill and Jagielka need to be at their best, even if I cannot believe that Suarez is really 100 per cent fit when he has been injured. Tall order: England defender Gary Cahill has his work cut out . Like I said, it is as a counter-attacking team that Uruguay are at their most dangerous. I suspect Suarez will replace Forlan. The former Manchester United player is no longer the force he was. But I wonder what threat Uruguay can pose on the flanks. Stuani and Rodriguez offered little against Costa Rica. That said, they cannot play that badly again. I just cannot see them beating England. On the contrary, England will win if they attack with the same purpose they showed against Italy.

"Dean McDermott is bending over backwards to try and heal his troubled marriage to Tori. The couple, who’ve shared their marital woes with fans on True Tori, were reunited again last week when their five year old daughter Stella went under the knife for a tonsillectomy.  ‘Tori was doing her best to juggle work on her new TV series Mystery Girls, and care for her four kids on her own while Dean was away in Canada filming Chopped Canada. But when Stella was ready to go into the hospital for surgery, and their 7 year old son Liam ended up home with the flu, it just became too much for the mom of four to handle by herself. Togetherness: Dean wants to make it right with Tori, so herushed home to her side in her hour of need . ‘When Dean phoned home and heard how stressed Tori sounded at the prospect of facing things on her own, he went to producers and asked if he could take a week off to fly back to LA and help his over- worked, over- wrought wife with the kids.  ‘The Chopped producers agreed to help Dean out and he arrived back in town just in time to accompany Stella and Tori to the hospital where doctors removed her tonsils,’ says the source. ‘And he was there to help nurse Liam back to health. ‘Ironically, Tori also had her tonsils out when she was five,’ adds the source. ‘And at the time her mom Candy gifted her with a little white stuffed dog she named Angel, who she took into surgery with her. Tori still had the pup, dressed in scrubs, so she passed it on to Stella, who cuddled it on the way to surgery too! Ailing: Stella was in the hospital for a tonsillectomy and Liam was down with the flu, leaving it all down to Tori, who's working on her new show. Then came Dean to the rescue . Salt of the earth: Dean has helped build a very successful Canadian version of the food show Chopped, but he was willing to ask for some time to relieveTori . ‘Tori was totally relieved when Dean showed up and stepped in to take over the running of the house,’ says the source. ‘Tori spent the night with Stella, while Dean went home to mind the kids and prepare some dishes his wife could freeze and serve up after he left.  ‘Dean made chicken soup for Stella and he made a Mac and Cheese casserole and veggie squash lasagna for Tori and the kids.  He also stocked the fridge with foods that would be easy for Tori to pull out and fix while he was away.’The source says Dean plans to stay until late Sunday afternoon so he can attend Stella’s 6th birthday party before flying back to Toronto. ‘Stella doesn’t actually turn six until the following day, but Tori planned a party for her on Sunday so Dean could attend,’ says the source. ‘She was very happy that her husband came home to help her in her time of need, and it was a move in the right direction when it comes to trying to put their troubled marriage back together.’","After hearing how harassed Tori was in a phone call, Dean asked for an emergency time out from his Chopped Canada bosses and returned to Los Angeles .

"In its quest to bring home the last remaining captive solider from Afghanistan, the Obama administration reportedly did not follow standard detainee release procedures and ignored concerns voiced by the intelligence community that the inmates selected for the trade may be too dangerous. The release of Islamist militants from Guantanamo Bay in exchange for Army Sgt Bowe Bergdahl was orchestrated by President Barack Obama's national security team comprised of Pentagon, State Department and Joint Chiefs of Staff officials. 'There was no dissent on moving forward with this plan,' National Security Counsel Deputy for Strategic Communications Ben Rhodes told Time Magazine. Scroll down for video . Single-minded: President Obama, pictured here with the parents of Sgt Bowe Bergdahl, was reportedly determined to secure his release and steamrollered prisoner swap despite strong opposition . However, members of the intelligence community and Pentagon officials in the past had successfully prevented the release of the Afghan nationals labelled too high-risk to be set free, according to Time. An official familiar with the interagency discussions told the publication there were members of the Obama administration and the State Department who argued that the military should 'suck it up and salute’ on this controversial issue. By all accounts, President Obama was determined to secure Sgt Bergdahl's release after five years of captivity. The idea to swap the kidnapped soldier for enemy combatants first came about in January 2009, when then-newly elected President Obama ordered the Justice Department to assess all 240 Guantanamo Bay detainees and select candidates for a potential prisoner exchange. The review found the five Taliban fighters too high-risk to be released because they were likely to return to the fight against U.S. forces in Afghanistan. 'These five are clearly bad dudes,' an official told Time. The Obama administration has formed the Guantanamo Transfer Working Group to debate and handle the release of detainees from the military prison in Cuba. Over the past five years, the group made up of Pentagon, State Department, Homeland Security and the Joint Chiefs of Staff officials has signed off on 82 detainee releases. The fate of the five Taliban militants, identified as Mohammed Fazl, Mullah Norullah Noori, Mohammed Nabi, Khairullah Khairkhwa and Abdul Haq Wasiq, has been the subject of heated and recurring debates in the intelligence community. Celebration: A pro-Taliban website has published a video that claims to show Taliban detainees arriving in Qatar after being released from Guantanamo Bay as part of a prisoner exchange . The White House and some officials in . the State Department saw the release of the high-risk detainees as the . cornerstone of a possible peace agreement with the Taliban more than a . decade in the making. Those . who opposed the plan, however, pointed to top secret intelligence . showing that the Islamists posed a serious threat to American interests, Time reported. In . the months leading up to the prisoner swap, the Obama administration . and its supporters allegedly pressured officials on the other side of the debate . to come up with evidence proving that the Guantanamo inmates were, in . fact, dangerous. Until this . year, a law passed by the Republican-controlled Congress required the . Obama administration to meet a set of stringent conditions in order to . release anyone from Guantanamo Bay. But . a few months ago, Democratic Senator Carl Levin was able to weaken the . certification standards, allowing prisoners to be set free if it benefited national security. Prisoner swap: Abdul Waq-Hasiq, left, and Norullah Noori, right, have been freed from Guantanamo Bay . Former combatants: The prisoners, including Khirullah Khairkhwa, left, . and Mohammed Nabi, right, will remain in Qatar for at least next year as . part of the terms of their release . RELEASED: Mohammad Fazi is believed to have been at the command of a mass killing, and the United Nations has sought his prosecution for war crimes . This week, the . Guantanamo quintet were shipped off to Doha, Qatar, where they are . expected to remain for a year before being allowed to return home to . Afghanistan. President . Barack Obama promised Tuesday that the U.S. will be keeping an eye on . the Afghans' movements, but a Gulf official stated that the former . inmates will be allowed to roam the country free. Following the deal that freed Sgt Bergdahl, the last American soldier held in Afghanistan, concerns have . been expressed by some U.S. intelligence officials and congressional . advisers over the role of the Gulf Arab state as a bridge between . Washington and the world of radical Islam. The . Gulf official said the Taliban men, who have been granted Qatari . residency permits, will not be treated like prisoners while in Doha and . no U.S. officials will be involved in monitoring their movement while in . the country. ‘Under the . deal they have to stay in Qatar for a year and then they will be allowed . to travel outside the country... They can go back to Afghanistan if . they want to,’ the official said. Speaking during a press conference in Poland Tuesday, President Obama defended the prisoner swap, saying that the U.S. had an obligation not to leave any of its service members behind. 'Is there a possibility of some of them trying to return to activities that are detrimental to us? Absolutely,' Obama told reporters. 'That's been true of all the prisoners that were released from Guantanamo. There's a certain recidivism rate that takes place.' But he then added: ' I wouldn't be doing it if I thought that it was contrary to American national security.' The five traded Guantanamo inmates include former ministers in the Taliban government, commanders and one man who had direct ties to the late al-Qaida chief Osama bin Laden. The prisoner exchange has been scrutinized by Republican leaders, especially in light of revelations that Sgt Bergdahl may have deserted his post in 2009 before he was taken captive. Senator John McCain described the Taliban militants as the 'hardest of the hard core.' ‘These are the highest high-risk people. Others that we have released have gone back into the fight,’ said McCain. Days after his rescue, Bergdahl (pictured in a video released by the Taliban in 2010) was in stable condition at a U.S. military hospital in Germany . The Pentagon concluded in 2010 that Bergdahl walked away from his unit, and, after an initial flurry of searching, the military curbed any high-risk rescue plans . U.S. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said he hoped the exchange might lead to breakthroughs in reconciliation with the militants and rejected accusations from Republicans that it resulted from negotiations with terrorists, saying the swap had been worked out by the government of Qatar. ‘We didn't negotiate with terrorists,’ Hagel said in an interview on NBC's Meet the Press. ‘As I said and explained before, Sergeant Bergdahl was a prisoner of war. That's a normal process in getting your prisoners back.’ Bergdahl, 28, was handed over on Saturday to U.S. forces who had flown in by helicopter. The Taliban said they had released Bergdahl near the border with Pakistan in eastern Afghanistan. U.S. officials said the restrictions placed on the five Afghan militants included monitoring of their activities. Those assurances were greeted with scepticism by U.S. Republicans and some Afghan officials, who voiced concerns that the men would rejoin the insurgency. In Washington, some Republicans . suggested the administration had bypassed a legal requirement to notify . Congress 30 days in advance about prisoner releases from Guantanamo and . said the deal amounted to a negotiation with terrorists. Republican Senator Ted Cruz of Texas called it a ‘dangerous price’ to pay. But . Obama's national security adviser, Susan Rice, said the administration . was concerned about Bergdahl's health and did not have 30 days to wait in light of the urgent situation. Some members of . the U.S. Congress worried even before the prisoner exchange took place . over the release of the five. Pentagon . documents released by WikiLeaks said all five were sent to Guantanamo in . 2002. They were classified as ‘high-risk’ and ‘likely to pose a threat’ to the United States, its interests and allies. From left, Sen. John Barrasso, R-Wyo., Senate Intelligence Committee Vice Chairman Sen. Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga., and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Ky., disparage the decision to swap Sgt.

Bowe Bergdahl, saying today that the country had an obligation to not leave military personnel behind .

Klose, with 14 World Cup goals, is one goal off the record held by former Brazil striker Ronaldo.

"After Mario Balotelli scored two stunning goals in the semi-final of the 2012 European Championships against Germany, a member of staff at his club Manchester City offered a startlingly frank opinion. 'Don’t worry,' he said, 'He will still be useless when he comes back to us. He just hasn’t got it.' Two summers – and a change of club – later, question remarks remain. Big game player: Mario Balotelli lit up Euro 2012 with a stunning strike against Italy in the semi-final . Suitable: And the celebration in Warsaw fitted his colourful persona, too... Bench life: But things never really worked out for Balotelli at Manchester City . Balotelli is an AC Milan player now . and sixteen goals last season was reasonable. Already in this World Cup . he has made a telling contribution with his winning goal against England . in Manaus on Saturday. The . 23-year-old also picked up fourteen yellow cards and one red last . season, though, and the general view in Italy is that his all-round . contribution over the course of a campaign that saw his team finish . eighth in Serie A was modest. Here . in Brazil, opportunity beckons once again for Balotelli to further his . quest to be taken seriously. Against England he delivered but whether he . can repeat that performance against Costa Rica here today (FRI) remains . to be seen. There is a . theory in Italy - as there was at City - that Balotelli simply cannot . get his blood up for the smaller games, something that certainly . appeared to be the case in Poland and Ukraine two years ago. In . Euro 2012, we all remember his contribution against the Germans and his . penalty in the quarter-final shoot-out against England. Less notable, . though, were some rather anonymous performances in the group stage. Swoop: A move to AC Milan followed, but it is with Italy where the influential striker shows off his true form . Trust: Cesare Prandelli manages to get the best out of the enigmatic forward . On Thursday Italian coach Cesare Prandelli said: 'If look at our four years with . Mario there were times when he was our weapon, the asset, the man who . would take us to the moon. 'Then, after two months, he wasn’t performing. Many people thought he would not even make it to the World Cup. 'If he is focused for 90 minutes, great. Otherwise we have someone just as good and fresh. He must give 100 per cent.' As . he hinted, Prandelli has had his own issues with Balotelli in . the past. A coach who does not believe in indulging players he told . Balotelli on his return to Serie A that he must improve his behaviour on . and off the field if he was to have a future under him for Italy. Certainly . Balotelli plays for his country largely because of a lack of viable . alternatives. There is a dearth of genuine world class centre forwards . in Italy. The days of Alessandri del Piero and Christian Vieri are long . gone. Loving life: Balotelli shows off some skills in the Italian training session in Rio de Janeiro on Wednesday . Crucial: Balotelli celebrates his goal against England in the 2-1 win on Saturday . In case your forgot: And just to make sure, he reminds viewers the score after the game . Ssh: Balotelli is ready to silence his critics in Brazil this summer... he's made a good start . Many in Italy still view Balotelli as a side show. A . paternity dispute with ex-girlfriend Raffaella Fico only ended when a . DNA test that showed positive in February while an immaturity that . ultimately proved too much even for his father figure Roberto Mancini at . City bubbled to the surface during a remarkable TV interview after a . defeat to Roma in April. Asked . by pundit Giancarlo Marocchi - a former Italian midfielder – why he . hadn’ t tried harder, Balotelli said: 'You don’t know anything about . football. You always talk about me. 'When Milan win Mario is great but when Milan lose it’s always Mario’s fault. I don’t need your criticism. I criticise myself. 'You always expect me to score five goals in a game.' Balotelli terminated the live post-match interview by throwing down the microphone and walking off. In . terms of his future, it is far from certain that he will remain at . Milan. Linked with Arsenal, his flamboyant agent Mino Raiola has refused . to rule out a move. Me, me, me: Balotelli has filled up his World Cup sticker book... with pictures of himself! Time to be taken seriously: Arsenal have been linked with the striker, who may need another fresh start . Lucky fans: Balotelli joins Danielle de Rossi and Gianluigi Buffon for a qucik selfie with supporters . At . City, the view was always that Balotelli would never prosper unless he . was encouraged to feel that he was the only player who really mattered. With Italy, he certainly seems to respond to the fact that Prandelli . plays him as his only central striker. Balotelli said: 'I hope it’s not Mario’s World Cup but Italy’s. 'I hope to give a good contribution to team but I’m not interested in being the great star. I want our team to win.' A . game against Costa Rica may not get the juices flowing in quite the . same way as the England clash did. Another stand-out show on Friday night, . though, would go some way to answering pertinent questions. Meanwhile, . goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon returns to the team today having recovered . from an ankle injury and having opened up with his battle against . depression for the first time. The Italian legend has revealed that he suffered with the illness in private for years before finally asking for help. Anger: Samir Nasri holds back Balotelli during an ill-tempered Champions League affair against Ajax . Ready to do the business: Balotelli can fire Italy into the next round with victory against Costa Rica on Friday . 'I didn't know if I could talk about it to anyone,' he told 4-4-2 magazine. 'But then, very gradually, I would chat about it to friends, to team-mates, people really close to me. 'I began to understand I had a problem and that it was something that could be dealt with, that could be cured. 'I . didn't take a break because I felt this great responsibility to my . team-mates and to people who relied on me. I didn't want to let them . down. 'I didn't feel like I could stop playing, not with that responsibility. 'It helped to see a psychologist but, as I said, the support of friends and team-mates was a big thing for me.'","Balotelli's ability was often doubted at Manchester City .

"Marion Bartoli's first match back on British grass since winning Wimbledon ended in retirement and defeat to a 15-year-old schoolgirl from Surrey. It could not have been more different from the day almost a year ago when she stood on Centre Court holding the Venus Rosewater Dish having achieved her life's dream. The Frenchwoman retired a month later but accepted an invitation to play in the exhibition Liverpool Hope University International Tennis Tournament at Liverpool Cricket Club. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Bartoli announce retirement six weeks after winning Wimbledon . Off her game: Marion Bartoli plays a shot before she was forced to retire from the Liverpool International . A dream come true: British teenage Jodie Burrage celebrates as she beats the Wimbledon champion . Her first opponent was teenager Jodie Burrage, and it quickly became clear when Bartoli said she had not played much tennis, she really meant it. The 29-year-old had been cautious about her hopes beforehand, saying: 'Now I can kind of accept to miss a tennis ball. 'I just still love to play. My body couldn't take the amount of training and what I still had to do to be a professional tennis player, but to be a recreational tennis player is something I can probably do still. 'If she beats me that's fine. It's not like I need to win any more.' Bartoli was virtually unrecognisable from the player who did not drop a set at Wimbledon last year and the disbelief on Burrage's face was clear as she raced into a 4-0 lead. Bartoli won the next four games but could not save the set, and trailing 7-5, 3-2 she pulled out with a right shoulder problem. Rusty: Frenchwoman Bartoli has played little tennis since she retired in August last year . Burrage was left to celebrate the most unlikely of wins, saying: 'I can't believe it. It's amazing to be able to say that, and even to be able to play against her. So to win, it's unreal. 'I was really nervous, I was thinking, 'Just get a couple of games', or even a game. Then when I was out on the court, I couldn't believe the scoreline and how I was playing. I played really well. 'When I won the first game, I thought it was lucky. When I went 4-0 up, I was like, 'Oh my God, you could get a set'. I didn't think I'd win. Then I think I lost my focus a bit but I still managed to get that and then go up in the second. 'Unfortunately she had to pull out, but still it was incredible. When I told my friends from tennis I was playing her, they were telling me I should be really excited not nervous. They're going to be really happy for me.' Serving it up: Bartoli (left) was taking on Burrage in her first match at the exhibition event in Liverpool . Burrage, 208th in the junior world rankings, earned the chance to play in the event by winning a junior tournament in Liverpool last year. That gave her a pass into qualifying, which she came through on Sunday, but her first opponent came as a big shock. 'I don't think we knew Bartoli was playing but then after I won qualifying I was told, ""You're playing Bartoli on Thursday"",' Burrage said. 'I just said, ""What? Excuse me?"". Hug: Bartoli gives a ball boy a cuddle before being forced to retire with a shoulder injury . 'I've just played girls round my age before, I haven't played any professionals like her. This is a one-time experience.'

The steady stream of goals and entertaining football in Brazil was always going to run dry at some point, and no-one will be particularly surprised that it happened in Curitiba’s Arena da Baixada between these two nations on Monday night. The first draw of the World Cup – and a goalless one at that – leaves Bosnia and Herzegovina favourites to qualify from Group F behind Argentina if they can avoid defeat to Nigeria in Cuiaba on Saturday. The reigning African champions knew that this was arguably their best chance of a first World Cup win in nine attempts going back to 1998 when Iran also celebrated their solitary victory over the USA, but Stephen Keshi’s side were desperately disappointing.

Coach Carlos Queiroz has bristled at suggestions in recent days that his team are negative but they did what they do best; keep a clean sheet. They arrived at the World Cup with more of them than any other qualifier – although it has to be pointed out that their opponents on the road to Brazil included Maldives, Qatar and Lebanon.Nigeria, meanwhile, had scored fewer goals than everyone else, so it hardly had the hallmarks of a classic. The Super Eagles started with an attacking intent but ran out of ideas as the match wore on. The pedestrian approach of Chelsea’s Jon Obi Mikel summed up their play and Liverpool’s Victor Moses was a major disappointment. His replacement just seven minutes into the second half, Shola Ameobi, went close with two headers and Peter Odemwingie added fresh impetus when he came off the bench for Ramon Azeez towards the end, but Nigeria simply did not carry nearly enough of a threat. They actually had the ball in the net as early as the seventh minute through the lively Ahmed Musa, but Ecuadorian referee Carlos Vera ruled it out for a foul on goalkeeper Alireza Haghighi by Mikel.

Aerial duel: Nigeria's Kenneth Omeruo beats Iran's Reza Ghoochannejhad in the air . Lost out: John Obi Mikel loses possession as Andranik nips into to take the ball away . Strength: Emmanuel Emenike holds off the challenge of Iran defender Amir Hossein Sadeqi . Musa had another chance moments later but he was beaten to the ball when Emmanuel Emenike, Nigeria’s top scorer in qualifying, muscled Jalal Hosseini off the ball and crossed from the left, and Ogenyi Onazi’s follow-up effort rolled inches wide of the post. Musa also troubled Haghighi with a clever freekick from 30 yards that had the keeper scrambling back across his goal to save just inside his right-hand post, but the best chance of the half fell to Iran 11 minutes before the break from their first corner of the game. Lone striker Reza Ghoochannejad and Ashkan Dejagah were their liveliest players and it was no surprise that they were both involved. Dejagah swung over the corner from the right and Ghoochannejad, who had scored 10 goals in his previous 14 international appearances, met it with a firm header that brought a smart save from Vincent Enyeama who until then had been a virtual spectator. The second half produced little better. If anything, it got even worse and the final whistle was greeted with a chorus of boos from Nigeria’s supporters. Not since 1930 have we had to wait so long – 12 games – for a draw at the World Cup. Iran will be more than happy with a point, even though they will struggle to record another shutout against Argentina in Belo Horizonte at the weekend. For Nigeria, however, the pressure is definitely on. Nigeria's 0-0 draw, the first stalemate of this summer's tournament, wasn't exactly a classic. However, former West Ham and Newcastle goalkeeper Shaka Hislop appeared to fall asleep during the match.

"Ronny Deila last night confirmed John Collins was on a shortlist to become his assistant and provide the local knowledge he needs. The 38-year-old Norwegian was unveiled at Celtic Park yesterday as Neil Lennon’s successor and will strengthen his backroom staff in the coming days. Deila will also assess Craig Gordon before confirming whether or not the former Scotland goalkeeper will be added to his squad for next season. Local knowledge: John Collins is on the short list to become assistant manager at Celtic . Hoop dreams! Stromsgodset boss Ronny Deila has been appointed as the new Celtic manager . The ex-Stromsgodset manager admits he wants someone with an in-depth understanding of the Scottish scene by his side as he adapts to his new job. Collins could fit the bill, although Celtic chief executive Peter Lawwell insisted there were other names still in the frame. ‘There are three or four candidates,’ said Lawwell. ‘Ronny has confirmed he (Collins) is one of the candidates so we will wait and see. ‘I think we need someone who knows what Inverness is like and the trip up there at 12.15 on a Sunday, who knows Scottish football. I think that would be a big requirement for a no.2. We need to really start that process.’ Gordon is understood to have undergone a medical with Celtic earlier this week. He has been a free agent since quitting Sunderland with knee problems in 2012 but is now restored to fitness. ‘He has been in training with us and we are just going through discussions with his agent at the moment to see if anything comes out of that,’ said Lawwell. Glove and war: The new Celtic manager will decide if Craig Gordon joins the Celtic squad for next season . ‘He came to train with us and he was excellent. Stevie Woods (goalkeeping coach) couldn’t speak highly enough about him so we might be close on that one.’ But Deila was cautious about the speed of any move, saying: ‘It’s too early to say because I have not seen him play football and I have not talked to him. I have to see what is around and into the team.’ Lawwell made it clear the decisive call on Gordon would be down to Deila. ‘Absolutely,’ said the chief executive. ‘We will work the same way that we always have in that the manager has the final say on all players coming in or going out, or their stays being extended.","Ronny Deila has replaced Neil Lennon as Celtic manager .

"Marvin Travon Hicks, 47, of Palmdale, California, was convicted of second-degree murder on Friday . A man who led police on a high-speed chase while high on PCP before slamming his car into another and killing a two-year-old girl has been found guilty of murder. Marvin Travon Hicks, 47, of Palmdale, California, was convicted of second-degree murder on Friday in the DUI pursuit crash that ended with the death of 2-year-old Madison Ruano. Madison had been considered a ‘miracle’ child by her parents after she survived being born severely prematurely at 25 weeks and weighing less than two pounds. Jurors had found Hicks guilty of several felony counts including gross vehicular manslaughter while intoxicated and DUI causing injury in April, but were unable to reach a verdict on the murder count. A different jury deliberated for just three hours on Friday before finding Hicks guilty of second-degree murder. According to the official report, police started pursuing his vehicle after he ran a red light on Sierra Highway on December 6, 2012. Authorities say he then weaving between cars going at speeds over 100 mph and even drove briefly on the wrong side of the road in an attempt to avoid authorities. It was at that point that Hicks drove his black Toyota straight into the blue Lexus driven by Madison’s mother Tina Ruano, 37. Both the woman and child suffered massive trauma to their upper body and were immediately taken to the hospital. 'Miracle' child: Madison Ruano died after the blunt force trauma from the December 2012 crash disconnected her spinal cord and she was pronounced dead at hospital . Under the influence of PCP and alcohol: Photographs from the scene show the front of Hicks' car was completely totaled and he had a difficult time standing as he was pulled by police from his vehicle . The blunt force trauma from the crash disconnected Madison’s spinal cord and she was pronounced dead at Antelope Valley Hospital, reports KTLA. Photographs from the scene show the front of Hicks' car was completely totaled and that he had a difficult time standing as he was pulled by police from his vehicle. According to court testimony, Hicks was under the influence of PCP and alcohol at the time of the crash. Records show he had a long history of drunk and reckless driving, including convictions for driving under the influence and misdemeanor hit and run dating as far back as 1995. Madison's family described the toddler as being a 'precious little light to ALL who encountered her' Hicks now faces 21 years to life in state prison and will be sentenced on October 10. A memorial page on Facebook set up by Madison's family describes the toddler as being a ‘precious little light to ALL who encountered her.’ It describes how she managed to survive, despite being born nearly three months early and at only 1 pound and 14 ounces. By the time Madison left the hospital, she was a healthy four pounds, much to the relief of her parents. ‘We know that Madison is now in the arms of our dear Lord, Jesus,’ the page reads. ‘We are thankful for her life and the short time that we had her with us.'

"Detectives investigating the murder of two British tourists on the Thai island of Kao Tao are hunting for three men - two of whom they say raped the female victim while the third watched. The bodies of David Miller, 24, and Hannah Witheridge, 23, were found on a beach on the holiday isle on September 15. A bloodstained garden hoe, believed to be the murder weapon, was found nearby. In the wake of heavy criticism over the investigation into their brutal deaths, police sought to allay fears that the killers had long escaped saying they were 'confident' that a significant breakthrough was on the horizon. The bodies of David Miller, 24, and Hannah Witheridge, 23, were found on a beach on Koh Tao on September 15 . The last known picture of the pair, together with a group at the sports bar called Choppers - they also went to the AC bar where a group of amateur footballers were celebrating the end of a tournament . 'Two of the suspects raped and killed Witheridge while another one witnessed the murder,' Pol Lt Gen Panya Mamen, commissioner of Provincial Police Region 8, said yesterday. 'We're confident we have a very high chance of finding the suspects,' the senior police officer said. 'I'm not worried [about high public expectations] because I know how much the probe has been progressing. We just have to follow forensic results.' Police have taken more than 200 DNA samples from men living and working in the area of the crime scene - most of them being migrant workers from Burma. But there have been no matches so far with the victims. Police have been taking DNA swabs and footprints of people on the island in a bid to find the killers . A group of Thai footballers are the latest people to be questioned by police amid fears that the hunt for the killers has stalled. A spokesman for the Royal Thai Police confirmed that DNA samples were taken from 'more than eight' footballers - who reportedly threw a late-night party at the AC nightclub where the victims spent their final hours - and officers were awaiting the results. The amateur footballers were allegedly at the nightclub celebrating the end of a tournament while the British backpackers were there. Police have offered a reward of 700,000 baht - roughly £13,300 -  for information which leads to the arrests of the culprits. The murders – and Ms Witheridge's suspected rape – were the work of a group of at least three 'attackers', two of whom are Asian men, police have claimed, citing analysis of DNA and other evidence . Dressed in a pink top and white skirt, Hannah Witheridge looked happy and relaxed as she strolled past fruit stands and in and out of bars on the night before her murder . Investigating officers have said they believe sexual jealousy was the motive behind the murder of 23-year-old from Great Yarmouth in the early hours of September 15. A condom has recently been recovered from the crime scene which has the young woman's DNA on its outer skin. Police have already said that DNA recovered from her body has shown that two men took advantage of her on the morning of her death. 'The discovery of the condom is an important piece of evidence,' said provincial police commander General Kiattipong Kaosam-ang. 'Solving this crime is going to come down to DNA matches and we are working hard on this.' Her recently-met friend David Miller, 24, from Jersey died when he was attacked after - it is believed - he went to her aid when he found her in trouble near a group of boulders on the beach. The movements of David Miller and Miss Witheridge are not known afterwards though some locals claim to have seen them in a bar arguing with an Asian man . DNA found on a cigarette matches a sample taken from Miss Witheridge and police say they are hoping that matching it with a suspect would 'open the door' to finding who else was involved. 'There is no doubt the murder of Miss Witheridge was sexually motivated because none of her belongings or those of the English man were missing,' said General Kiattipong Kaosam-ang. 'Yes, the motivation for the attack is rape.' He said the attackers might have been smoking when they saw Miss Witheridge walking back to her guest house alone along the beach. Miss Witheridge's family said they are 'broken' by her death and revealed several days ago that they have returned to the UK with her body. In a statement, they said: 'As a family we feel enormous relief to have Hannah back at home where she belongs. 'We continue to work closely with officers to assist in the investigation and bring those responsible to justice. 'Our family is broken and require time to grieve in private - as do Hannah's many friends.'","Hannah Witheridge was attacked by three men before being beaten to death .

"If you were to guess what this prim-looking lady with neatly cropped hair sporting a drab grey cardigan gets up to at night, you might imagine it involves a hot mug of chocolate and earnest novel. But in fact, as these pictures show, she whips off her top, adorns her nipples with fluffy feathers and dons a bright pink wig to transform into Viola Van Wilde, her burlesque alter ego. Photographer Sean Scheidt decided to embark on a project showing the contrast between the real-life people and their glamourous and risqué stage personas. Scroll down for video .

Short Staxx before and after her transformation: She shows that a  touch of nipple accessorising can go a long way to jazz up an outfit . The Baltimore-based 31-year-old says each photography session in the series he calls 'Burlesque' took between two and five hours, during which time he interviews the subjects - who do not wish to make their real names public. Sean explains: 'The shoots are more than anything an interview process. We talk about the ""why"" behind burlesque, how their families have reacted, what challenges they face among other things. 'This helps make them really unaware that they are in my space being photographed. It disarms and gives them more power over the final image. 'Usually performers have control over their space and their crowd. When you take them out of that and place them in my studio, I have the power.

Performer Fox Martin: On the surface, burlesque may seem no different than stripping, but the photographer says it's a form of artistic expression . The photographer says he has friends in burlesque and has been going to shows for the past two years, but without much more than a surface interest. So what inspired him to start the photography project? 'I was hired to photograph a burlesque show, but found myself fascinated by what occurred backstage and seeing ordinary people transform themselves completely in various ways. 'Then about a week later I happened upon a YouTube video of Judy Garland rehearsing, that was spliced with the actual performance she gave a few hours later. 'It was really amazing, she appeared to be a drunken mess, or sleepy or whatever, but a wreck, mumbling words, etc. A few hours later she was just ON and amazing. She had transformed completely for the stage.' Dolly Longlegs, photographed by Sean Scheidt. The photographer says: 'I hope this project allows people to delve further into the concept of quick judgment' The photographer embarked on a project capturing burlesque performers, including Marla Meringue above, after he was hired to photograph a burlesque show and found himself fascinated by what was happening backstage . The photographer says: 'I saw this exact transformation backstage during the burlesque show (not from a wreck to something spectacular, but a transformation nonetheless). 'So, I began to reach out to the Bbrlesque community to try and photograph this process of transformation. The idea is very simple upfront, to juxtapose photographs of each performer as they are every day, with an image as their stage persona. 'As I began to know the subjects personally, the project began to take on the task of confronting what viewers might believe burlesque is all about and any preconceived notions about what a person who does Burlesque might be like.' The photographer wants his project to clarify the distinction between burlesque and striptease. 'For those unfamiliar, burlesque can, on the surface, seem no different than stripping.' All skin and bones: Valeria Voxx's burlesque transformation . It might be a woman's burlesque world but that doesn't stop Paco Fish from lashing on the eye makeup . Ruby Rockafella in and out of her burlesque costume . But he explains: 'While striptease is also used in burlesque there is a distinction between the two. In burlesque, performers use their bodies as a tool to confront an audience, often using the striptease to challenge sexual objectification, orientation and other social taboos. 'In this way performers are in control of their own bodies and how they are presented to an audience. This can make a lot of people uncomfortable and is in direct opposition to stripping where ""performer"" is reduced to no more than a sexual object, catering only to the sexual fantasies of the often male dominated, audience. 'It is my hope that this project highlights that point by de-mystifying and showing each performer as a person who has ownership of their own body. I also hope this project allows people to delve further into the concept of quick judgment, and consider the individual, as well as the art of performance.'

"Younis Tsouli, a convicted extremist dubbed Terrorist007. The Old Bailey heard today that he sent a letter from jail calling for jihad . A convicted extremist dubbed Terrorist007 sent a letter to his father from a maximum security jail calling for jihad, a court heard today. Younis Tsouli, 31, sent the letter and was also caught with a copy of al-Qaeda magazine 'Inspire' in his cell, just two months before he was due to be released from prison, the Old Bailey has heard. The letter, which was written in Arabic and sent to his Moroccan homeland, was intercepted when he was an inmate at Long Lartin jail before he was moved to HMP Woodhill. In the letter, Tsouli states: ‘This is a letter of advice to those members of my family who will learn their lesson.’ The letter also includes rants about Islam for several paragraphs and adds: ‘Allah gives quick rewards for those who go out for jihad. He goes on to explain that the soldiers of Islam will be ‘granted victory or paradise' and adds, ‘there is no better action than jihad. Prepare for war, since its flames are rising.' He also adds that those who go to fight in Syria are not fanatics and should be praised and that the people of Syria had been ‘showered with rockets.’ ‘For two years the world has been playing while the children of Syria have their body parts cut in the street,’ he rants. Meanwhile when he was asked about the al-Qaeda magazine found in his cell in HMP Woodhill, Tsouli said: ‘Its part of my legal papers. I’ve had it for ages.’ Prison officers also recovered several screwed up pieces of paper which were internet printouts showing pictures of ‘extreme Islamic nature,’ the court was told. Tsouli simply shrugged his shoulders when asked about the papers and said ‘Do what you with it.’ When he was interviewed, Tsouli refused to comment. He told detectives: ‘I should be the one asking questions, not being asked questions.’ The copy of Inspire was an exhibit in a previous terror trial, changing hands between convicted extremists Mohammed Chowdury and Omar Latif before somehow reaching Tsouli. The magazine name-checked Tsouli himself, using a variation of his nickname, ‘Brother Irhabi 007’, in an article listing ‘Muslim prisoners’. Tsouli admitted he had been given the copy of ‘Inspire’ magazine in ‘secret’ when he was at Long Lartin and it had been transferred with him when he was moved to Woodhill. But he refused to say who had passed it to him. Tsouli wrote the letter to his father calling for jihad while he was a prisoner at Long Lartin jail, pictured, in Worcestershire . He explained: ‘I could not name the individual and put someone in a position where they are liable for prosecution.' Tsouli came to Britain with his father in 2001 and became involved with Muslim extremists. He said he went protest marches over the Iraq war which he regarded as illegal. He trained in IT and started designing and running websites for terrorists. ‘It was alleged I had assisted in the creation and maintenance of websites that allowed insurgents to upload and disseminate material,’ he said. The material ranged from religious offerings to reports on terrorist atrocities. Tsouli added: ‘I didn’t voice an opinion. I just allowed a platform to be available for the insurgents groups to show what was happening on the ground. He agreed that people who looked at the site might want to get involved in similar attacks. Tsouli admitted a series of offences at Woolwich Crown Court including incitement to commit acts of terrorism, including murder in 2007. He was sentenced to 10 years imprisonment - a term later increased to 16 years by the Court of Appeal. He had been moved to HMP Woodhill pending his release as moves were made to deport him back to Morocco. Tsouli denies possessing a document likely to be useful to persons committing or preparing acts of terrorism. The trial continues at the Old Bailey, pictured . He said he initially did not want to be deported when he was released because he feared being tortured when in his homeland. He wanted to remain in Britain, even though he did not like the food, weather and found regional accents difficult to understand. ‘As a convicted terrorist I would have been under a lot of scrutiny. There were rumours about torture being used,’ he said. ‘If I had been deported I would have been under severe and continuing danger.’ He said when he was given the Inspire magazine he was told it might be ‘of interest.’ His name as 007terrorist was given in a list of prisoners under the headline ‘Oh Allah free the Muslim prisoners.’ ‘It was disappointing my name was still featuring in the Al Qaeda publication,’ said Tsouli. ‘I wanted to move on from this offence, having served a nine year sentence. ‘The last thing you want is any mention like this in a publication related to Al Qaeda.’ Tsouli said he had the magazine for about six months before he went to Woodhill. He was asked to explain several times why he had not thrown it away. ‘It was evidence and it might have been of interest. It was of concern in relation to my deportation,’ he said. ‘I can’t give you answer. I just kept it for some reason or another. ‘I just don’t necessarily throw stuff away that might be of use.’ But he then decided he wanted to be deported back to Morocco because he was told if his immigration status was not resolved he could be made to stay in jail and serve his entire sentence. ‘I had not read the document since I had been at Wood Hill. I would have got rid of it,’ he said. ‘There was no way I could have left the prison with that document.’ Tsouli, of no fixed address, denies possessing a document likely to be useful to persons committing or preparing acts of terrorism. The trial continues. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Younis Tsouli sent the letter to his father while an inmate at Long Lartin jail .

"The most remarkable aspect of England’s World Cup shambles is that all the FA top brass from chairman Greg Dyke downwards are united in wanting Roy Hodgson to remain as manager. Even those from the FA hierarchy who have witnessed the two successive defeats in Brazil are staunchly in support of Hodgson, despite England heading for humiliation at the World Cup on a par with the Ashes fiasco last winter. The same message that Hodgson should carry on regardless of England’s woeful showing came from FA chairman Greg Dyke and Ivan Gazidis, chairman of the International committee, as well as the other FA international delegates in Sao Paulo — Keith Lamb, Peter Barnes and Barry Taylor. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Sportsmail's Ashton and Sale's latest offering form Brazil . Staying put: The FA have insisted Roy Hodgson will remain as England coach despite the World Cup debacle . Aston Villa chief executive Paul Faulkner, temporary board member since Premier League chairman Anthony Fry was sidelined through serious illness, was another FA figure inside the Arena Corinthians who had no negative words about Hodgson. In Brazil Dyke has been very vocal in attacking FIFA president Sepp Blatter, but would only say when asked about Hodgson’s position: ‘There’s another game to go.’ There has to be a root-and-branch review by the FA of whether it was worth having over 80 personnel in the official party. Steve Peters, the highly acclaimed sports psychiatrist, has seemingly made little impact and cut a timid figure after matches when his main role was seemingly helping to carry the team equipment onto the coach. When approached, he quickly referred any questions to the FA communications department. Little impact: Steve Peters (right), who was also used by Liverpool last season, has appeared to make little impact on the England team . The England media centre, installed at a cost of around £80,000 at Rio’s Urca military camp and the training pitch there — which was even more expensive to prepare — will have been used only eight times if England go out at the group stage. That figure includes manager Roy Hodgson’s likely final Press conference next Wednesday. The fall-out from an early England World Cup exit would reverberate across the FA. Selling Wembley tickets for an unappetising September friendly against Norway will be that more difficult, as will finding the desired global roster of FA Cup sponsors and a new lead partner. England will also lose some of its lustre as a marquee opponent for friendly internationals although, fortunately for the FA, long-term broadcast agreements at home and abroad are in place. Zlatan Ibrahimovic, probably the best player in football not involved in the World Cup, has been a guest of his PSG club president Nasser Al Khelaifi on a trip to Brazil. Zlatan has watched Chile beat Spain as well as Uruguay turn over England, with Ibrahimovic cheering on his PSG striker partner Edinson Cavani. Interested party: Zlatan Ibrahimovic watches England slump to defeat against Uruguay . The FA have had plenty of people freeloading at the World Cup. But Roger Burden, FA board member and former chairman of the Cheltenham and Gloucester Building Society, made sure he paid his own way to Sao Paulo to watch the Uruguay debacle. And Burden, who withdrew his candidature for the FA chairmanship because he doesn’t trust Sepp Blatter’s FIFA, only took advantage of his FA position to hitch a lift on the team bus after the game. The inquest into England’s dismal showing in Brazil will have to include the merits of having a Club England department within the FA concentrating solely on the national teams at various levels. Certainly England’s senior side performed better results-wise when the now sidelined FA International Committee had responsibility for team affairs.

"It took Cristiano Ronaldo 52 seconds to confirm his World Cup well-being as Portugal signed off for the finals on a comprehensive note in the MetLife Stadium against a ragged Republic of Ireland. Out of action since the Champions League final, Ronaldo ripped through the Irish defence with his first touch to spear a shot on target. The message was clear – CR7 was back. In front of Roy Keane, his former Manchester United comrade, Ronaldo smacked the post, made an assist, and twice went close from open play as he showed enough of his repertoire to indicate he will carry a serious threat in Brazil. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Ronaldo dancing in training and star in a save the planet advert . Raring to go: Cristiano Ronaldo was in the thick of the action as Portugal beat Ireland in their warm-up game . Back fit: Ronaldo looked sharp on his return to international football as Portugal ran riot in the first half . Great start: Hugo Almeida (left) opened the scoring after two minutes to set Portugal on their way . Main man? Almeida scored twice to ensure the Besiktas striker will go to Brazil in top form .

Referee: B Toledo (USA). Attendance: 46,063 . The 29-year-old World Player of the Year also shipped a couple of hefty Irish challenges which certainly tested his fitness after knee and thigh problems. Wisely, Portuguese coach Paolo Bento withdrew Ronaldo just after an hour on a newly-laid surface that was a slow, spongy, and a hazard throughout. 'Yes, it was important that he played and we would not hide it,' Bento said afterwards. 'A player like Ronaldo is important for any team, and that's the case for us. It's good that he is back.' Too often, players lost their footing and it was a blessing that no one picked up an injury. Twenty years after their World Cup win over Italy in the old Giants Stadium, the Irish were cut down to size as they slipped to their most comprehensive defeat under Martin O’Neill. But for the first half heroics of David Forde in the goal, the margin of defeat would have been greater for a team which played, at times, as if the summer break was on their minds. After a lusty rendition of ‘The Star Spangled Banner’ sung by Uncle Junior from The Sopranos, the Portuguese fans had reason to cheer Ronaldo’s early surge, and an early goal. It came inside the third minute when Ireland lost possession – this became a worrying trend – and Silvestre Varela crossed from the right for the unmarked Hugo Almeida to head home. After a double save from Forde to deny . Ronaldo and Raul Meireles, who also returned after injury, Portugal . doubled their advantage when Richard Keogh deflected Fabio Coentrao’s . left-wing delivery beyond Forde into the top corner. Disallowed: Manchester United winger Nani rolls an effort into Forde's net but it was chalked off . Captain fantastic: Ronaldo's return marked a major improvement in Portugal's attacking play . The . one-sided nature of play continued when Ronaldo struck the butt of the . upright before the Real Madrid star found the target with a header which . bounced off Forde into the path of Almeida, who snapped up his second . goal of the night. There . were few positives for O’Neill, who sprang a surprise by leaving out . Robbie Keane from the starting XI and giving Jon Walters the armband and . the lone ranger role in attack. It . was only the second time in 13 years that Keane didn’t start when fit – . the last occasion was for a friendly against Georgia 12 months ago. O’Neill . says he knows what Keane can do but the omission of Ireland’s record . goal scorer and most capped player is a perhaps a clue to O’Neill’s . thoughts for the Euro 2016 qualiifers. Keane will be 34 next month and needs to be used sparingly for the campaign. He . was missed as the Irish lacked bite in the final third, . although things improved after the break when James McClean grabbed a . consolation goal from a quickly taken free-kick in the 52nd minute. It . was McClean’s first goal on his 23rd appearance. While . Wes Hoolahan grafted in midfield and Keogh’s bravery was without question, . the Irish conceded two more goals after a raft of substitutions late on through Vierinha and Coentrao . as O’Neill was left to reflect on a worrying run of six games without a . win. Hero's welcome: Real Madrid's Ronaldo was greeted by fans as he came out to warm up ahead of the game . Response: Ronaldo was playing his first game since the Champions League final as he returns to fitness . Middle man: Almeida controls the ball between Derby County pair Jeff Hendrick (left) and Keogh . Hard work, that! A shattered Alex Pearce shakes the hand of Ronaldo after the crushing 5-1 defeat . 'I thought we started nervously, and that was something we wanted to try and avoid,' O'Neill reflected. 'Two of their goals came from our possession, which we gave away needlessly. 'Those are the things that over the course of the European championships you have to try and cut out. I thought we came to grips with it - we got the goal back and looked dangerous at times. 'We were still trying to chase it to get back to 3-2. When I finally sit down and analyse it, there should be things I am happy about and obviously things we need to improve. 'I feel it is not disheartening in the sense that it was 3-1 and if we shut up shop, it is 3-1 and it doesn't seem so bad. 'I am not too bothered. I have done this before at club level, trying to chase games and stay as positive as possible, and considering the changes that we made and some of our main players not playing, I don't think this will kill us off.'

"The open enrollment period for federal Obamacare plans will begin more than a month later than it did last year, with this year's start date coming after the midterm elections. In 2013 consumers could begin signing up for plans on Oct. 1. This year they were scheduled  to start their applications on Oct. 15. But the Obama administration announced late last year that the second enrollment period would instead begin on Nov. 15 - a full week and a half after the consequential federal elections taking place on Nov. 4. Both the White House and the Department of Health and Human Services have said politics aren't at play. The enrollment date was delayed this year to give insurers more time to calculate rates and consumers more time to familiarize themselves with healthcare plans available to them, they've said. A man receives information about  health insurance options last Friday in Paterson, New Jersey. Americans enrolling in Obamacare through the federal exchanges have a month and a half longer to review their options this year than they did last year . Still, the move has the added convenience of allowing insurers to keep next year's rates a secret until voters have already cast their ballots for or against Democrats who voted for or support the health care law. At a news briefing last fall, then-White House Press Jay Carney confirmed the postponement of the fiscal year 2015 and denied that the timing of the midterm elections factored into the Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services' decision. 'The fact is, we're doing it because it make sense for insurers to have as clear a sense of the pool of consumers they gain in the market this year, before setting rates for next year,' the White House spokesman said. CMS is the division of HHS that is responsible for implementing the health care law. An HHS official told Fox News at the time of the announcement that the purpose of the revised enrollment schedule was to give insurers 'the benefit of more time to evaluate their experiences during the 2014 plan year,' particularly after glitches with healthcare.gov caused numerous delays in the first enrollment period. The government was supposed to cut consumers off on March 31 but ended up allowing them to sign up for coverage well into April. Fox's HHS source tried to frame the fall 2014 delay as 'good news for consumers' because they 'will have more time to learn about plans before enrolling.' However, Republicans are crying foul. The way they see it, the administration is purposefully trying keep the true costs of Obamacare from Americans until after November's congressional elections. 'If premiums go through the roof in the first year of Obamacare, no one will know about it until after the election,' Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley said when CMS announced the postponement a year ago. The federal health care site has been under construction since the last open enrollment period for Obamacare ended in April. Among the changes to the site is a simplified application that only asks customers 16 pages of questions instead of 76. Glitches that caused the site to crash during peak traffic times have also been resolved, HHS told the Associated Press, and more than 125,000 people will be able to access the site at the same time. The next open enrollment period begins on Nov. 15. and ends Feb. 15. The Congressional Budget Office expects roughly 13 million Americans to sign up for Obamacare in fiscal year 2015, up from the eight million people who signed up last year. In a statement released last Friday Americans for Prosperity President Tim Phillips claimed, 'the President sold ObamaCare to the American people on the false promise that it would make health care more accessible and more affordable for those who needed it most. 'Sadly, ObamaCare has actually put affordable health care even further out of reach for millions of Americans,' the conservative non-profit head claimed.The administration’s decision to withhold the costs of this law until after Election Day is just more proof that ObamaCare is a bad deal for Americans.' Obamacare continues to be unpopular with many Americans, and Democrats should be concerned, if they already are not, that Americans facing sticker shock on their health care plans could take their anger out at the ballot box. Alaska, Iowa and Louisiana are all set to see premium hikes next year, and the Democratic Senators representing all three states are in danger of being knocked off by their Republican challengers. In Alaska two insurers, Premera Blue Cross and Moda Health, are planning double-digit rate increases, according to the Washington Times. The Times reports that 88 percent of Alaskans won't be dramatically effected by the rate hike because they qualify for government subsidies. However that hasn't stopped the Republican candidate in the state's senate race, Dan Sullivan, from using the news as a cudgel against incumbent Sen. Mark Begich, a Democrat who voted for Obamacare. 'Did you lose your coverage due to ObamaCare? Are your premiums set to skyrocket? Follow the link to share your ObamaCare story and stand up to the elected leaders in D.C. who sold Alaskans out,' Sullivan said in a Facebook post on Sept. 12. While Obamacare has taken a backseat to other prominent issues in this year's elections such as immigration, jobs and the economy and the war against the Islamic State, Republican Senate candidates in Iowa and Louisiana have also made the health care reform law a central issue in their campaigns. CMS didn't immediately reply to a request for comment from MailOnline on Republican's accusations that the 2015 enrollment period was pushed back for political reasons.","In 2013 consumers could begin signing up for plans on Oct. 1; this year they were scheduled to start their applications on Oct. 15.

"A Chinese gang who dug up the bodies of recently deceased young men sold them to superstitious families - whose single sons then 'married' them for good luck. The scam was exposed by accident when police arrested a man on stolen bike and found others stashed at his house. The thief, Wang Tsou, 34, was taken in for questioning - where he confessed to also stealing the body of a young woman from the local cemetery with his friends. The body that was dug up in Juye County near Heze City in China's Shandong Province was then sold to a man for the equivalent of almost £2,000 and was then sold on again for £4,000. The gang dug up the woman at a cemetery in Juye Country, in China, pictured, and sold her for almost £2,000 . Police said a total of 11 men have been arrested in connection after a bicycle thief admitted stealing the body . Tsou's confession led to a further ten people being arrested and police said an investigation is ongoing. Police spokesman Zhang Linhai said: 'Although the bicycle thief was only a small player, his arrest and surprise confession led to an unraveling of a network of people involved in the sale of stolen female bodies. 'We have arrested 11 people so far but the investigation is still ongoing.' In China, 'ghost marriages' are an ancient custom - but they are now illegal and carry jail sentences of up to three years for anyone who steals a dead female body. China's Communists have attempted to stamp out some traditions, including ghost marriages, since taking control in 1949. The families who buy the dead female bodies do so in order to satisfy tradition by carrying out a marriage service with a living or dead man. Police officers questioned Wang Tsou, pictured, about a stolen bike but he also confessed to robbing a grave . The scam was uncovered by accident after police searched Tsou's home and found other stolen bikes there . Ghost marriages are sometimes carried out to fulfill the requirement that a dead man should not pass into the afterlife without a wife or that an older brother needs to marry first before the younger brother can. Some believe that men who are buried alone will bring bad luck on the families for future generations. Police spokesman Zhang Linhai, pictured, said the bicycle thief was only a 'small player' but it has led to unravelling a larger network of people involved in the sale of stolen female bodies . Grave robbers dig up the bodies in an attempt to make large sums of money for very little work - but the corpses need to be fresh. A body that has already started to rot is worth very little, and a skeleton of a dead woman is worth nothing at all. Last year, four men were jailed for digging up female corpses in China and selling them as brides. The men admitted to stealing the bodies of ten women which they then sold to the families of bachelors to stop them wandering the afterlife alone. A court in the northern province of Shaanxi said last year the gang of men had abused the 'bad tradition' of ghost marriages and were jailed for 32 months each. Before that, another gang of grave robbers were caught trying to sell a dead woman days after her family had already tried to use her as a ghost bride. The woman's body was snatched and the gang of five offered the woman to another family for £3,000 before they were caught. And in 2007, a man was arrested after killing and then selling six women as ghost brides. He claimed that 'killing people and selling their bodies is less work than stealing them from graves'.","Scam was uncovered when Wang Tsou was found with a stolen bike .

"Gianluigi Buffon gave Italy a late scare in training on Friday night when he twisted an ankle and was unable to complete the session in Manaus. Buffon hobbled off but manager Cesare Prandelli remains optimistic that his captain and veteran goalkeeper will be available to face England. Prandelli has enough defensive problems on his plate already. The Italy boss lost his first-choice left-back Mattia di Sciglio, when the AC Milan full-back suffered a calf strain in training on Thursday. Doubt: Goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon is a doubt for the game with England . All smiles: Buffon hugs a team-mate during training before leaving the session early due to injury . Concern: Italy manager Cesare Prandelli hopes Buffon will be fit to face England . It has not forced him home but he will not be fit for the Group D game in Manaus, which means a reshuffle at the back. It was unclear whether the Italians would settle for switching . Torino’s Matteo Darmian to the left and bring in Ignazio Abate of AC . Milan at right-back, or whether he would move Giorgio Chiellini from . centre-half to left-back and start with Parma’s Gabriel Paletta in the . middle. Defensive . power has always been Italy’s great strength but Prandelli’s team have . struggled at the back, which has already prompted the manager to push . Andrea Pirlo forward from his preferred deep midfield role to . accommodate Daniele de Rossi as a screener, protecting the . centre-halves.

"Click here for more from our brilliant Match Zone, including this graphic of Carlo Costly's opening goal for Honduras. He is the lesser known Valencia but it is Enner and not Antonio who is making a name for himself in Brazil. The 25-year-old sits joint top of the goalscoring charts following his match-winning double against Honduras in Curitiba. There he resides alongside more illustrious names such as Thomas Muller, Karim Benzema, Robin van Persie and Arjen Robben. But the muscular, pacey frontman – with an eye for goal to boot – might just be plying his trade in Europe as well next season should his World Cup scoring spree persist. Currently on the books of Pachuca in Mexico, there has been talk of interest from abroad and such speculation is sure to amplify given his man-of-the-match performance to keep alive his nation’s hopes of progression to the knockout rounds.

Man-of-the-match: Enner Valencia . *Match ratings by Craig Hope . And Antonio Valencia, of Manchester United, might just deliver a glowing report when he returns to English shores of the team-mate who now has seven goals from 12 international caps and was on target during the 2-1 defeat to Switzerland in their group opener. The marksman scored in either half to complete a come-from-behind victory and move Ecuador second in Group E behind France, who they face in Rio on Wednesday. Both Ecuador and Honduras had drawn with England in pre-tournament friendlies in Miami and, to borrow horse-racing parlance, that form had hardly been franked by the subsequent performance of the Three Lions in Brazil. But amid the blood, studs and thunder of a predictably feisty affair, there was also a healthy helping of Latin flair. Ecuador were first to threaten when Jefferson Montero lashed a low ball across the face of goal and only the out-stretched gloves of Noel Valladares denied Felipe Caicedo a routine tap-in. Honduras defender Victor Bernandez saw yellow after just six minutes for a wild swipe which felled Montero with the striker poised to level on goal. Enner Valencia did manage to escape the cynical attention of the Honduran backline when scampering clear on 20 minutes but the forward snatched at the opportunity and lobbed wide. The blonde-haired, black-bearded Bernandez was never far from the thick of the action and the centre-back should have opened the scoring on 27 minutes, somehow heading wide when unmarked and connecting with a corner-kick just eight yards from goal. Clean strike: Honduras' Carlo Costly (left) scores the opening goal of the game with a powerful effort .

Mobbed: Costly and his team-mates celebrate in front of the travelling Honduras fans at the Arena da Baixada . Ecuador striker Enner Valencia saw plenty of the ball outside of Honduras' penalty box, as his heat map below shows - Click here for more in our Match Zone . But it was Bernandez who turned provider for Costly to open the scoring just after the half-hour mark. His long punt downfield was misjudged by veteran Walter Ayovi and Costly made him pay, pouncing on the loose ball before drilling home in authoritative fashion from 18 yards. It was Honduras’ first goal at the World Cup in 32 years and sparked belief that a maiden victory at the finals could be in the offing. Their lead, however, was to last just three minutes and Valencia made it two for the tournament with a close-range stab after Juan Carlos Paredes’ shot was deflected into his path. Bernandez sought to restore Honduras’ advantage and he stung the palms of Alex Dominguez with a fizzing free-kick in first-half injury-time. There was still time for Costly to crack the post with a header before the break and strike partner Jerry Bengtson was booked when he followed up to bundle into the net with his arm. Costly missed the finals four years ago because of injury and he bore the look of a man with some making up to do, the 31-year-old’s rising drive drawing a flying save from Dominguez within 30 seconds of the restart after half-time.

Acrobatic: Honduras's Boniek Garcia (right) pulls off an overhead kick to clear the ball from Juan Paredes (left) Up for the cup: Ecuadord kept their hopes of qualification for the last 16 alive with this win in Curitiba . At the other end, Caicedo paid the price for his honesty when refusing to tumble under the clumsy challenge of a sliding Maynor Figueroa inside the area. Sadly, Australian referee Benjamin Williams chose not to reward the former Manchester City frontman and the chance was gone. But any injustice was soon forgotten when Valencia climbed to cushion Ayovi’s enticing free-kick into the bottom corner for his second of the night and third of the finals. He was denied a hat-trick late on when Valladares repelled his curling free-kick, but his name had been noted nonetheless.

"Luis Suarez has revealed he was only 50 per cent fit when he broke English hearts with two goals for Uruguay in their 2-1 World Cup victory - and that Roy Hodgson's refusal to label him a 'world-class striker' gave him added motivation. England are teetering on the brink of a group stage exit in Brazil after Suarez's brace left them bottom of Group D without a win from two matches. And the Liverpool striker says that Hodgson's refusal to label him in the same bracket as Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo following England's loss to Italy last week, coupled with constant talk of his knee injury, inspired his performance. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Luis Suarez's message to Uruguay fans after the match . Joy: Luis Suarez celebrates after scoring his second goal against England in Uruguay's 2-1 win . Clinical: Suarez fires past Hart (right) to put Uruguay 2-1 against England at the World Cup . Injured: Suarez revealed he was only 50 per cent fit during Uruguay's victory over England . All alone: Roy Hodgson's refusal to label Suarez as 'world class' motivated the Uruguayan striker . Hogdson said that Suarez would 'only be at that level' once he performed at a World Cup, something he made sure he did against England. Suarez told Uruguayan website Tenfield: 'It wasn’t revenge, but in England they talked about the injury and the coach had words that annoyed (me).' The 27-year-old forward's involvement in the World Cup had been in doubt since he underwent a knee operation five weeks ago, leaving the hospital in a wheelchair. He was also forced to sit on the bench as Uruguay were humbled 3-1 by Costa Rica in their opening Group D match. But Suarez was back fit to face England and scored an opportunistic header to put Uruguay 1-0 up, before winning the game after capitalising on Steven Gerrard's misdirected header and smashing home. Amazingly, Suarez says he was only half-fit for the match. Grateful: Suarez celebrates his first goal by hugging physio Walter Ferreira who he credits for getting him fit . Opportunistic: Suarez runs off in celebration after ghosting in to nod past Hart and put Uruguay ahead . VIDEO All Star XI: Luis Suarez . He said: ‘I was probably only 50 per cent fit - but it is due to the work of all the fantastic doctors and physiotherapist that I was able to be 50 per cent ready - and I am thankful that that was enough to beat England. ‘I have some more days to get ready for the next game now - and the more I train the sharper and more ready I will be. ‘It was a fantastic result - but it is not the job done. We need to make sure we go and get the right result against Italy - and then if we progress out of the group we can start to dream about what is possible.' Suarez celebrated his first goal by running to the touchline and hugging team physio Walter Ferreira, who helped with his recovery. 'My wife and my two children are important to me and Walter is also important, the goals were for him because of what he did for me,' Suarez said. 'I have to thank him. I scored the goals, but he is the man responsible for them.' Halfway there: Suarez says the job is far from over for Uruguay and they must beat Italy to progress . Celebrate: Cavani runs over to celebrate with Luis Suarez, who scored both Uruguay goals . Despite their victory over England, Uruguay still face the possibility of an early exit along with Hodgson's men. Their final Group D match is against Italy on Tuesday and Suarez knows they need to win to give themselves the best possible chance of progressing. He said: 'This victory is very important, it is crucial. 'It was a difficult match against a difficult rival. England are a strong team.

Here is all the information you need for the first game in Group F between Argentina and Bosnia-Herzegovina . Venue: Estadio Jornalista Mario Filho, Rio de JaneiroKick-off: 11pm (7pm, Brazil time)TV coverage: BBC1, from 10.30pmOdds: Argentina 4/11, Draw 7/2, Bosnia-Herzegovina 17/2Referee: Joel Aguilar, El Salvador . Backing their boys: Argentina fans will hope to see their country win the World Cup in Brazil . Managers:  Alejandro Sabella (Argentina) and Safet Susic (Bosnia-Herzegovina)Key clash: Lionel Messi v Emir Spahic . The Barcelona forward scored in his first meeting with Spahic, when the defender played for Sevilla in 2011. Spahic, 33, will not even be able to just focus on Argentina’s talisman, with Sergio Aguero and Gonzalo Higuain joining the four-time Ballon d’Or winner to make up a potent front-three. One to watch: Angel di Maria (Argentina) Outstanding for Real Madrid this season, di Maria’s role for his national side is equally important. Not only is the 26-year-old capable of gliding past defenders and chipping in with goals, he also has the discipline to track back and help his side defensively. This will be particularly important given Argentina’s potential weakness at the back. Head-to-head record: Played 2 Argentina Wins 2 . Threat: Angel Di Maria could be one of Argentina's danger men . Team News: . Lionel Messi takes centre stage in the World Cup on Sunday, facing Bosnia-Herzegovina in the Maracana with dreams of returning to the stadium for the final in four weeks' time. Argentina arrive in Rio with expectations running high, not least that Messi will produce the kind of displays that were absent in South Africa four years ago. Argentina have a wonderfully-talented attack, so much so that coach Alejandro Sabella could afford to leave Carlos Tevez out of his squad - but there are still question marks at the back, something readily admitted by Maradona, coach in 2010. That attacking strength is however causing a dilemma for coach Sabella. The coach has admitted that he favours a 5-3-2 formation - but he used a 4-3-3 set-up during the successful qualifying campaign, choosing not to squander his firepower. However, there have been indications in training this week that he is going to be more conservative against Bosnia, which means Gonzalo Higuain missing out. Much, of course, will depend on Messi but Bosnia coach Safet Susic's insists he has no plans to man-mark the four-times world player of the year. This will be Bosnia's World Cup debut, indeed their first major tournament having only played the first match as an independent nation in 1995 following the civil war and break-up of Yugoslavia. Argentina defender Federico Fernandez says they are acutely aware of the threat of Manchester City striker Edin Dzeko. Tough test: Lionel Messi is likely to be marked by Bosnia-Herzegovina's Emir Spahic .","Argentina are one of the favourites to win the World Cup .

"To the untrained eye, Ross  Barkley seemed to have played incredibly well. He was slick in possession, exciting and unpredictable. He went past defenders and he created England’s second goal for Rickie Lambert. So, it was a surprise when Roy Hodgson picked his performance apart. ‘He lost the ball an awful lot of times,’ said the manager. ‘If he’s going to be the player we want him to be, he has to make better decisions when he turns with the ball. ‘That’s not a criticism, but there were other performances out there who merited your obsession more than Ross Barkley. Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Phil Jones were outstanding, Jack Wilshere in the middle of the park, Rickie Lambert scored a magnificent goal. There always seems to be an enormous obsession with one player. I will be prepared to start any of the players in any game, but I’m not prepared to address the obsession with Ross Barkley.’ Dazzling: Ross Barkley was brilliant in the 2-2 draw against Ecuador, but Roy Hodgson wants him to improve . Assist: Barkley's brilliant run set up Rickie Lambert's second goal . Hodgson seemingly has a determination to be contrary. On a night when England supporters arrived at the Sun Life Stadium in Miami  looking for signs of encouragement, the young Everton midfielder surely provided some. The reaction from the boss seemed a harsh and prickly, like Glenn Hoddle trying to dilute the clamour for David Beckham in the build-up to France 98. Barkley was starting his first England game and seemed to cope well for a 20-year-old preparing for his first major tournament. He left the stadium without a word, head down, flicking through messages on his phone, some of them surely from home in Merseyside, with their thoughts on the post-match comments of Hodgson. Perhaps it was part of a misguided defence mechanism to protect Wayne Rooney, who had worked hard on the left wing and scored his first England goal since October. In front: Lambert lashed a powerful shot into the corner after a driving run by the Everton youngster . Effortless: Barkley, 20, was in complete control and comfortable in his first England start . Perhaps Hodgson feared it would fuel a campaign to start Barkley ahead of Rooney against Italy in Manaus on  Saturday week if he appeared excited by the attacking qualities of the young Everton midfielder, rather than seizing upon his errors. Perhaps he wanted to keep him grounded. Perhaps he really does believe Barkley is far too casual in possession, picked the wrong options, and that this was the reason his team were so painfully vulnerable at the back. Whatever the motive, Barkley can feel miffed. His pass completion rate was  91 per cent and he seemed to settle easily into the sleepy tempo of football in the tropical humidity. He injected a burst of pace when necessary and was willing to turn and take on defenders. His assist for England’s second goal was uplifting as he drifted left to right and nutmegged one defender, lured others towards him and rolled in Rickie Lambert. He may not have always picked the right option, but here he did. Worry: Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain was forced into an early exit after picking up a knee injury . Make way? Roy Hodgson might consider swapping Wayne Rooney for Barkley in the opener against Italy . Elsewhere, he offered a first-time pass or a well-balanced change of direction. He showed the poise and vision to open spaces for others and combined well with Lambert, exactly the sort of thing you would demand of your creator-in-chief. Until he tired in the final 20 minutes, Barkley made things happen. So did Oxlade-Chamberlain until struck down by the injury which may end his hopes of World Cup participation. Hodgson has always had a fondness for the Ox, having made him a surprise selection for Euro 2012 and stood by him through a serious knee injury last year and when a groin problem niggled away in April and May. Like Barkley he can go past his man, although just as the deep midfielders did not shield their centre halves well, Oxlade-Chamberlain did little to help James Milner, who found it hard to adjust to his role at right back. Slight criticism: Roy Hodgson said there were certain things Barkley could do to improve . There was little protection on display full stop. Frank Lampard and Wilshere, another desperate to stay fit and who limped off with cramp, are strong on the ball and prepared to tackle but do not naturally sense danger. They were unable to smother Ecuador’s movement around the edge of the box, but they shifted the ball quickly and England flexed well on the turnover of possession, especially when they funnelled through Barkley. To the untrained eye, that’s how it seemed: vulnerable at the back, encouraging going forward and  Barkley was a delight to watch.","Everton midfielder was brilliant for England in Ecuador .

"Wilfried Bony’s agent has revealed .

Newcastle . are among a clutch of clubs believed to be keen on the Ivorian, who . scored 25 goals in a stunning first season in south Wales following his . £12m from Vitesse Arnhem last summer. But .

"Defeat was just a few minutes old and the emotions came . hustling in, wave upon wave. There was disillusion, despair, bewilderment and . weary resignation. On the face of Roy Hodgson, you could read the entire, . distressful history of England at the World Cup. The old ones will recall those expressions flickering across . the frosty features of Sir Alf Ramsey in Mexico 1970. In turn, the same . emotions were to visit men like Ron Greenwood, Sir Bobby Robson, Glenn Hoddle, . Sven Goran Eriksson and Fabio Capello. Humble pie became their staple diet, for . all were ultimately confronted by the reality that the world will not buy what . England has to offer. Haunted: Roy Hodgson is the latest England manager to have reality check . The plot never changes. It follows a seemingly predestined . course and ends not with a bang but a whimper. Having studied the sobering . process for so long, even England's travelling followers have finally modified . their expectations. A great deal of hard currency crossed the bars of Sao Paulo . the other evening in return for a torrent of strong lager. Yet, thankfully, little . damage was done to people or property. For disappointment was muted, the . history lessons had been slowly digested. Yet still, in those first, vulnerable moments, Hodgson . seemed devastated. For he had worked unsparingly at his task. Preparations had . been expensively perfect, the camp was happy and hopeful and raw promise seemed . to be delivering heartening performance. After so much concentrated effort, the . manager had allowed himself to believe the words of that terrible old World Cup . song: 'This time, we'll get it right.' And they didn't. As Greenwood, Robson . and the rest could testify, they never do. This time, in fact, the errors arrived in clusters and the . culprits formed a long, disorderly queue. Steven Gerrard performed like a . Steven Gerrard tribute act, enduring a nightmare of hapless imprecision. Leighton Baines was similarly culpable, while charity insists that we do not . mention the defensive efforts of Phil Jagielka. All this and Joe Hart turning . in the kind of display which confirmed the growing reservations about his . general competence. As a former Premier League manager confided after the . match: 'The truth is, England don't have a defence.' Forward planning: Roy Hodgson is expected to stay on as England boss . One bizarrely popular response was to blame the absence of . John Terry. Yes, that John Terry. All would have been well, it seems, had we . pleaded with the man who was properly stripped of the England captaincy for the . vile abuse he screeched at Anton Ferdinand and who later rejected international . football. You may recall the almighty chasing he received in Bloemfontein at . the last World Cup finals on the day that Germany put four past England. The . notion of a return to Terry is both frivolous and demeaning. Then there is the matter of the manager. Once again, knees . jerk and sanity is suspended. 'Sack him!' screams the pack. 'He's got to go', . bawl the hunt followers. While a prominent bookies' runner, shamelessly . inciting mug punters, offered 9-4 that Hodgson is no longer manager of England . come September: 'It would appear that tactics, team selection and motivation . are things potentially lacking in Hodgson's armoury,' drivelled the impertinent . huckster. Already, the pursuit  carries the whiff of the lynch mob. Now clearly, Hodgson has made errors. The omission of Ashley . Cole was a decision he will surely regret. Cole may no longer be the surging . athlete of old but he would have proved a more effective defender than the . struggling Baines. And the selection of Frank Lampard remains difficult to . comprehend. Lampard has yet to kick a ball in this World Cup. If he is again . ignored for Tuesday's irrelevant scuffle with Costa Rica, then the public may . deserve an explanation for his presence in the squad. And if England's young . pretenders really did freeze for the crucial match with Uruguay -  having . bloomed so bravely against Italy - then we are entitled to ask how it happened . and why it was not foreseen. But Hodgson is a football manager; he is not an alchemist. England's performances are governed by the number and quality of the . players at his disposal. It is scarcely the manager's fault that the numbers . are so small and the quality so tepid that he is forced to send out . Jagielka  and Gary Cahill as the country's unchallenged central . defensive alliance.  Sacking the manager would represent a failure . of the imagination, a placatory bone tossed to the chasing hounds. On the ball: Hodgson has to learn from the mistakes he made at World Cup . Yet there were fears that the Football Association chairman . Greg Dyke might stoop to a populist gesture. After all, his last notable . gesture - that embarrassing throat-slitting charade at the World Cup draw - . proved a remarkably accurate prophecy. Fortunately, Dyke has recognised the . futility of abandoning Hodgson at this stage and has announced his support of . the manager through to 2016. His next step, of course, should involve an outright . confrontation with the Premier League, who were created with the boldly . declared and palpably fraudulent aim of improving the national side. Already, . Dyke has asked the central question: 'If your top league is largely foreign- . owned with foreign managers, why should those in control care about developing . the England team?' But his subsequent attempts to address the problem have been . incoherent and unconvincing. Quite possibly he is hopelessly handicapped by his . past. As a prominent television executive in the early Nineties, . Dyke played a crucial role in the League's formation. The consequence of his . pioneering efforts could be seen in the Arena Corinthians, Sao Paulo, on . Thursday evening. At such times, English football treads a well-worn path. After the initial shock and the subsequent eruption of public anger, those . charged with running the game wring their hands, shake their heads and solemnly . promise that this affront to our national dignity must never be allowed to . happen again. Then the new season arrives, fresh millions are expended on . new  foreign recruits and we return to our usual orgy of Super Sundays and . Magic Mondays. And the nation  forgets how it felt to be humiliated with . the whole world watching and sniggering. One man at least will never forget. The merest glance at . that crumpled face told us how savagely he was suffering. Hodgson had . entertained high hopes that he might break the mould at this World Cup, that he . might achieve something quite dramatic with his young, striving, adventurous . players. But old habits die hard. Success is reserved for better, more . deserving football teams. And within the space of two unhappy matches, Roy . Hodgson has joined the ranks of Greenwood, Robson, Hoddle and the rest. All gifted men, all fine football managers. And all victims . of the English disease. P.S . As English football takes its early bath, the search for . scapegoats begins in earnest. The suspects so far include the manager, the . coaches, the media, the defence, the strikers, the pitches and the weather. And . yet, the most culpable candidate by far has slipped clean away. He is an . orthopaedic surgeon at the Medica Uruguaya hospital in Montevideo. On May 22, . this gentleman was required to repair part of a meniscus cartilage in the knee . of a celebrated athlete. He did his job with such disobliging brilliance that . his patient (pictured above) felt able to play international football precisely four . weeks later.

"Victoria Beckham pictured leaving a shop in LA carrying her daughter Harper, who can be seen sucking on a pink dummy . Victoria Beckham was yesterday accused of stunting her daughter’s speech and putting her teeth at risk of damage by still letting her use a dummy. At three years old, Harper Beckham is beyond the age that most health experts would advise giving a child a pacifier. Dummies are intended to help settle a restless child at bedtime and are recommended only for small babies, as prolonged use can cause speech impairments and wonky teeth. However some parents use them to stop a child crying, or because it has become a habit. Yesterday Mrs Beckham, 40, was pictured emerging from a shop in Los Angeles and carrying her daughter, who was sucking on her pink dummy. The toddler turned three in July and is well beyond the usual recommended cut-off point of 12 months. Last night pregnancy expert Clare Byam-Cook said that Mrs Beckham was putting her daughter’s wellbeing at risk. ‘Most people agree that prolonged use of the dummy can damage the teeth, by pushing them forwards and getting them misaligned,’ she said. ‘It can also affect speech development, because so many mothers stick a dummy in their toddler’s mouth just to shut the toddler up. The toddler just sits there sucking away on its dummy and doesn’t talk or do anything.’ She added: ‘If a mother allows her toddler to have a dummy in her mouth for large parts of the day, she will definitely stunt her speech development. Scroll down for video . ‘[Harper] should be looking at her surroundings and pointing things out to her mother but anything she says will be unclear because of the dummy, so she will get used to mumbling speech.’ Most experts recommend parents wean a child off dummies before their first birthday because the habit becomes harder to break as they get older and can lead to thumb-sucking, which can also damage teeth. Mrs Byam-Cook said: ‘A dummy should be there to comfort and settle a small baby, not just to stop a small baby crying, who is crying for a reason. ‘And certainly not to stop a three-year-old doing anything. It’s for use for very small babies only. ‘Harper is being carried by her mother, so she doesn’t need the comfort of the dummy.’ Harper is carried out of the store by her mother. An expert has said dummies should be used by very small babies only, and recommends weaning them off before their first birthday . David Beckham pictured with his daughter Harper and her dummy at a Los Angeles Dodgers game in August . Harper is the youngest of Mrs Beckham’s four children with her husband, former England footballer David, 39, and is the couple’s only daughter. The pair, who married in 1999, are also parents to Brooklyn, 15, Romeo, 12, and nine-year-old Cruz. In the past Mrs Beckham, who is regularly seen out and about with her children, has admitted feeling guilty about leaving them behind when she goes to work. The former Spice Girl said: ‘It’s a huge juggling act, when you are a working mother and looking after your family. ‘Millions and millions of women around the world are doing this every day, but it’s not easy and, yes, you feel guilty every time you walk out of the door to go to work.’","Victoria Beckham pictured leaving shop carrying daughter with dummy .

The future's bright: Holland fans look to turn Brazil orange . Managers: . Vicente Del Bosque (Spain)Louis van Gaal (Holland)Team news: Spain and Holland played out one of the most disappointing World Cup finals in history four years ago. They get a chance to make amends right away in Brazil. In one of the quirks of the draw for Brazil, Spain opens the defense of its title against the country it beat in the championship decider in Johannesburg four years ago. But while Vicente Del Bosque's team has stuck to its attacking philosophy, Holland coach Louis van Gaal is packing his defense and hoping one of his three star forwards, Robin van Persie, Arjen Robben or Wesley Sneijder, can snatch a goal on the counterattack in their Group B opener at the Arena Fonte Nova in Salvador. Key clash: Wesley Sneijder vs Sergio Busquets . Four years ago Sneijder’s performances placed him in FIFA’s All-Star team but he was stopped by Busquets. The Dutch still rely on the Galatasaray playmaker to dictate their tempo but in Busquets he faces an opponent that few get joy out of. Key men: Holland's Wesley Sneijder and Spain's Sergio Busquets could play key roles for their sides . One to watch: Daryl Janmaat (Holland) Louis van Gaal’s 5-3-2 experiment should get an outing here and the ‘Dutch Dani Alves’ from Feyenoord will be key to providing width in attack to feed Robin van Persie, as well as defensive cover. Head-to-head record: . Played 9 Spain Wins 4 Draws 1 Losses 4 . Dutch of class: Daryl Janmaat is one of the main men for Louis van Gaal's side . Making the move: Cesc Fabregas has made the switch from Barcelona to Chelsea .","Spain's clash with Holland is a repeat of the World Cup final in 2010 .
Vicente Del Bosque are the current holders of the World Cup .
Chile and Australia are the two other sides in Group B .
This is the first time the two World Cup finalists have met in the tournament directly after contesting the final since 1990, when West Germany beat Argentina 1-0 in the final (after meeting each other in 1986).
La Roja lost their opening game of the 2010 World Cup to Switzerland, but went on to become the first team to ever win the tournament having lost their first game.
Vicente Del Bosque has only lost one of his 25 World Cup games as Spain head-coach, including qualifiers (W22 D2). That was against Switzerland (0-1) in 2010.
David Villa - Spain’s top scorer at World Cup Finals (eight goals) - has been directly involved in seven of Spain’s last nine goals in the tournament (six goals, one assist).
Spain have won their last six World Cup games, their best ever run in the tournament. Their last four games have ended in 1-0 wins.
Spain have kept a clean sheet in each of their last four World Cup games, the longest current run. Indeed only Italy (five games in 1990) and Switzerland (five in 2006 & 2010) have ever had a longer run in the competition.
Holland have made it past the group stages in their last seven previous World Cup participations.
Robin van Persie was the top scorer in the 2014 European World Cup qualifiers (11 goals).
Spain and Holland have a perfectly even head-to-head record with four wins apiece and one draw, though Spain won the only previous World Cup clash 1-0 in the 2010 final.
The defending champions have only won their first game in three of the last 10 World Cups (D4 L3), with Italy drawing 1-1 with Paraguay last time out.

"Arsenal captain Thomas Vermaelen is ready to quit the Emirates Stadium for a move to Manchester United. The Belgium international has told close pals that he wants to complete a controversial switch to Old Trafford after the World Cup. United manager Louis van Gaal wants to sign the central-defender this summer in a deal that could be worth in the region of £12million. VIDEO Scroll down to see Vermaelen parading the FA Cup with Arsenal . Out: Thomas Vermaelen wants to leave Arsenal and join Manchester United after the World Cup . International pedigree: Vermaelen (front left) is currently on World Cup duty with Belgium . Shrewd business? United manager Louis van Gaal wants to sign Vermaelen in a deal worth £12million . It is understood Vermaelen's representatives have already agreed personal terms with United. The next obstacle United must overcome agreeing a transfer fee with Arsenal, though Sportsmail understands the Old Trafford club will not make a formal offer for the defender until after his involvement in the World Cup is complete. Nevertheless, United will table a bid and, with Vermaelen on board, are confident of sealing his signature. Vermaelen has grown increasingly frustrated in north London during recent months as he's been forced to play second fiddle to first-choice central defensive pairing Per Mertesacker and Laurent Koscielny. However, Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger is unwilling to let his skipper leave the club without having a replacement lined up. Having already lost right-back Bacary Sagna, who was the club's fourth choice centre-back, to Manchester City, the Gunners boss does not want to leave himself short of cover in the position. Vermaelen has a year left on his current Arsenal contract, meaning he can leave the club for nothing next summer - a scenario the Gunners are keen to avoid. The Gunners are ready to offer Vermaelen a new contract this summer, but without the guarantee of increased first-team opportunities next season, the Belgian is likely to be reluctant to sign.

"Roy Hodgson admits he is concerned about the 'pathways' available for young English footballers, rather than the 'production line' but wants more to be done to clear their route to international football. As a failed World Cup campaign ends against Costa Rica on Tuesday, Hodgson has for the first time addressed the findings of the England Commission set up last autumn by FA chairman Greg Dyke with a view to producing more elite players and a better national team. The England manager was part of the Commission but has been occupied with his preparations for the tournament in Brazil since Dyke unveiled his recommendations last month, which included the radical idea of creating a fifth division where clubs from the Barclays Premier League could play their B-teams. Humbled: Roy Hodgson (right) and captain Steven Gerrard have presided over an awful World Cup campaign . The difference: Luis Suarez (centre right) sent England tumbling out of the World Cup with a brace last week . 'It’s not been high on my agenda these last few weeks,' said Hodgson, but the issue will return to the agenda as the nation digests this World Cup performance, one which will go down as the worst ever if England lose to Costa Rica in Belo Horizonte. 'My concern is that we’re going to produce a lot of good players who will merit a place in the teams but will find their place blocked,' he added. 'It’s pathways that concern me more than the production line. It’s a fact of life and one that will take a long time to address, if we address it at all. 'The first thing we have to concentrate on is to get our own act right with the England teams. We have to make certain that we get as much access as we can to the players in the academies, that we induct them fully into what we’re expecting, and the academies do some very good work from 17-18, 19 Under 21 level. 'We have to make certain that when the players come into our environment that we induct them fully into what we are expecting, what we think being an England player means, not just in terms of behaviour and culture, but in terms of how important it is for you to play in a certain way, making certain we get our midfielders turning on the ball, receiving balls on the back foot, being positive. We can do some work on that. We don’t just have to rely on clubs giving their 19-year-old a game in the first-team or not. We can do that.' Rarity: Raheem Sterling is one of just a few talented England youngsters to play for a top Premier League club . The kid's alright: Ross Barkley is another top talent who will be central to England's plans in the coming years . Central to the 'pathway' problem is the fact the Barclays Premier League contains such a large proportion of overseas players, and the trend appears set to continue, leaving an ever diminishing pool of elite talent available to the England manager. The lack of experience at the very top has repercussions on England. Only four of those who started in the Group D defeat against Uruguay last week had played in the Champions League last season. Although whether the B-team solution, heavily criticised when it was revealed by Dyke, will cure this problem is debateable. 'There’s always going to be a problem,' said Hodgson. 'It’s ridiculous to try to suggest there isn’t. The players we’re looking at who could be good enough to play for England at 18, 19, 20 years of age are quite often playing in the top five or six clubs. That’s where the biggest stars are, and where the biggest money is and where the biggest chance of a blockage is in getting into the team. So let’s come to terms with that. Spot the Englishman: Manchester City won the Premier League with a cosmopolitan squad . 'Let’s keep looking if there is a system that would help these 19-year-olds who are not playing in United, Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool, Tottenham, Man City first-teams. Is there a way of getting them into football on a regular basis to play against men that would improve them. 'It’s not as easy as all that. You run into arguments like would the best thing for Raheem Sterling not playing for Liverpool be to go and play in the English third division or the Conference? Would that be the best way forward? It’s complicated. I’m glad we’re looking into it. But my head’s a little bit full of the emotions about going home on Wednesday which I’m not looking forward to.'","England boss has addressed FA Commission's findings for first time .

A woman motorbike racer died 10 days after she fell from her bike whilst travelling at 180mph and suffered serious head injuries during a race. Kara Rann, 27, lost control on a hairpin bend and was thrown from her Yamaha R6 motorcycle whilst competing at Pembrey Racing Circuit in Carmarthenshire, West Wales. The mother-of-one was airlifted to the University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff following the accident on September 14, and doctors spent 10 days trying to save her. Her boyfriend Marc McCullough, 25, who had been cheering her on at the NG Road Racing event, said: ‘Kara was so badly injured she lost her fight.’ Mr McCullough, who is also a motorcyclist, kept a vigil at her bedside as she was placed in a medically induced coma.

"Jose Mourinho has admitted Chelsea are interested in signing Cesc Fabregas from Barcelona as the midfielder’s Spain team-mate Gerard Pique let slip a £26.8million deal is already done.

On the Spanish midfielder, Mourinho said: ‘We have some (interest in Fabregas). I have interest in analysing the situation. ‘It looks like he’s really interested in leaving Barcelona, and is very interested in coming back to England. This is clear. But it’s not for now, or tomorrow, or for before the World Cup. ‘There is a process where he wants to leave, he wants to come to England because it’s the country where he wants to be and where he prefers to play.

The midfielder, 27, qualifies as a home-grown player in the Premier League after spending eight years at Arsenal and has expressed his interest in moving back to England after just three years in his native Catalonia, with two years left on his Barcelona contract. Pique is overheard telling Del Bosque, albeit with a smile: ‘He (Fabregas) told me that it is already done. He is leaving already, 33 million euros he said.’ The defender had earlier told Spanish newspaper Mundo Deportivo: ‘Cesc has never been sufficiently evaluated in Barcelona. He is not valued as he deserves. ‘Cesc would work in any club in the world, but this club is very complicated.’ Bumper offer: Chelsea are prepared to offer Eden Hazard £200,000 a week to keep him from PSG . Del Bosque was not happy that the comments were made public, saying: 'I think it was unfair that the conversation was leaked,' before adding on Fabregas: 'It's not for me to assess the clubs' decisions. He's a Spain player and I must say he's training brilliantly. He's really useful anywhere on the pitch"". Chelsea's new No 10 Eden Hazard will be be offered a bumper pay rise amid increasing speculation that PSG are preparing a whopping £61m bid. PSG manager Laurent Blanc has spoken publicly about his desire to bring the Belgium international to the French capital next season. Discreet overtures between Hazard's representatives and officials at the mega-rich Ligue 1 club have already taken place. But the Blues will look to ward off interest from France by handing the exciting forward a new deal - that will see his current £170,000-per-week deal rise to nearer £200,000. Mega bid: PSG boss is a keen admirer of Hazard and the club are preparing a £61m bid . His current contract still has three years left to run, and Chelsea hope the statement of intent of extended terms will be enough to keep Hazard at Stamford Bridge. However, that is unlikely to keep PSG from pursuing Hazard this summer as they plot a huge £61million bid. The Parisien club are convinced Hazard is obtainable this summer and that Chelsea are willing to do business at the right price. Chelsea have given Hazard the coveted No 10 shirt to wear next season, a further indication of their determination to the forward.","Jose Mourinho has admitted the Blues are interested in Cesc Fabregas .

Strikes from Fellaini and fellow substitute Dries Mertens turned the match around after Sofiane Feghouli had scored Algeria's first World Cup goal in 28 years from the penalty spot to put the Africans into a shock 24th-minute lead.

Now focus for the second one.' Belgium captain Vincent Kompany tweeted a selfie on the flight after the match with the words: 'Night time flight! Going back to home base! #SaoPaulo #Cheer4Belgium.' And Fellaini was also quick to lavish praise on his fellow Belgian squad members, saying that any of the 23-man squad could have been called upon and made the difference. It was Fellaini and Mertens on this occasion, but the 6ft 4in midfielder believes it could be someone else who changes the match next time around. He said: 'Everyone can see that it was guys who came off the bench who made the difference today.

"Luka Modric and Ivan Rakitic led their club sides to the Champions League and Europa League titles this season. Luiz Gustavo and Paulinho, meanwhile, performed averagely for German and English teams that finished fifth and sixth in their respective leagues. Despite Croatia’s brilliant central-midfield pairing, few believe they have a hope of beating Brazil in the opening game of the World Cup in Sao Paulo this evening. Anything but a Brazil win might be unexpected, but it is certainly not out of the question. Below, Sportsmail takes a look at why Croatia might ruin the party tonight… . VIDEO Scroll down to watch Ivan Rakitic score a stunning goal against Real Madrid . Star man: Luka Modric helped Real Madrid win the Champions League and can inspire Croatia tonight . Class: Luka Modric enjoyed a fine season in Madrid and he is considered one of the world's best midfielders . Dynamic duo: Ivan Rakitic (right) will partner Modric in midfielder and the pair are full of creativity . Champions: Modric (right) inspired Real to the Champions League and Rakitic Sevilla to Europa League glory . SERBIA . Croatia produced one of their best performances in years when they beat Serbia 2-0 last year and, though their form dropped after that result, the appointment of former player Niko Kovac has reinvigorated the squad. Brazil, meanwhile, struggled against the same opponents last week, labouring to a 1-0 win courtesy of a second-half goal from Fred. A disciplined Serbia side lined up in a 4-2-3-1 formation that frustrated Neymar et al, prompting jeers from Brazil fans at half-time and the final whistle. Kovac will have learned from the way Serbia stifled Brazil in midfield and how they tried to exploit the gaps left by Neymar and Hulk when Brazil were not in possession. Delivery: Crosses from Croatia full-backs Danijel Pranjic (left) and Darijo Srna (right) can cause Brazil problems . Primed and ready: Even without the suspended Mario Mandzukic (second left) Croatia will be dangerous . ON A WING AND A PRAYER . In Darijo Srna and Danijel Pranjic Croatia have two players capable of sending dangerous crosses into the Brazil box. With Dani Alves and Marcelo often caught high up the pitch, and Neymar and Hulk prone to neglecting their defensive duties, the two experienced full-backs could have some joy on the counter-attack. Mastermind: Croatia coach Niko Kovac hopes to tactically outsmart Brazil and spoil the party in Sao Paulo . STUCK IN THE MIDDLE WITH LUKA . Rakitic, who had a sensational season in midfield for Sevilla, will be key to the success of Croatia’s counter-attacking. The 26-year-old can break at speed with the ball at his feet and he knows exactly when to keep it and when to thread it through to a team-mate. Sevilla’s second goal in their 2-1 win over Real Madrid in March is a perfect example of just how good he is at this. He and Modric are very good at shielding the ball so Croatia can expect to see their fair share of possession at the Estadio de Sao Paulo. Holy trinity: Croatia's Mateo Kovacic (right) will likely join Modric and Rakitic in central midfield . And there is a high chance they might be joined in the centre of the pitch by a third playmaker, the Inter Milan prodigy Mateo Kovacic. The 20-year-old was superb in that win over Serbia last year and Kovac has opted to field him in the same team as Rakitic and Modric whenever possible since then. The absence of striker Mario Mandzukic through suspension is a big loss to Kovac’s side, but in Modric, Rakitic and Kovacic he has three players capable of creating chances for whichever striker replaces the Bayern Munich man, be it Eduardo, Ivica Olic or Nikica Jelavic. Pride and passion: Former Arsenal striker Eduardo would love to score against the country of his birth . Prolific: Eduardo has scored 29 goals in 63 internationals for Croatia and could be the difference tonight . HOMECOMING . Oh how Eduardo would love to score the winner for Croatia. The 31-year-old grew up in Brazil but spent much of the early years of his career in Croatia with Dinamo Zagreb before moving to Arsenal in 2007. The striker has said he will sing both national anthems before the game but as soon as the whistle goes he will be focused on denting Brazil’s trophy aspirations, as part of Croatia’s starting 11 or if he is introduced from the bench. Eduardo has an impressive strike-rate for Croatia, having scored 29 goals in 63 appearances since making his international a decade ago. Reject: QPR banished Julio Cesar out on loan to Toronto in February but he is Brazil's number one . Weak link: Croatia can exploit the fact Cesar has played very little football and is on poor form . BRAZIL ARE PLAYING A QPR REJECT . Deemed surplus to requirements by Harry Redknapp at QPR in February, Julio Cesar had to move to Toronto to get first-team football ahead of the World Cup, once Luiz Felipe Scolari told him he would not consider him for the squad unless he was playing every week. Cesar conceded nine goals in seven games for Toronto, keeping just two clean sheets during that spell. Croatia’s more attack-minded players would be crazy not to test the 34-year-old whenever possible. Pressure: The Brazilian nation expect Brazil to win and they will rely heavily on Neymar (pictured) Hype: Neymar has been billed as the poster boy of the Brazil World Cup and he will need to deliver . GREAT EXPECTATIONS . Ahead of the 1950 World Cup final the Brazilian newspaper O Mundo printed an early edition of the next day’s paper with a photograph of the Brazil team on the front and a caption that read: ‘These are the world champions’. The captain of their opponents Uruguay bought as many issues of the paper as he could and plastered them on his bathroom floor before encouraging his team-mates to urinate on them. Hours later it was Uruguay that were champions of the world, having beaten Brazil 2-1 on their own soil. Expectations: Luis Felipe Scolari managed Brazil to glory in 2002 and hopes to do so again in 2014 . Complacency has got the better of them before. The whole world will be watching Brazil tonight, expecting them to win comfortably. There is huge pressure on Scolari and his squad to succeed where the 1950 squad fell short, by winning a World Cup in Brazil. Neymar, in particular, as the poster boy of the World Cup, appears to be carrying the expectations of a nation on his slight shoulders.

"CLICK HERE FOR THE STATS AND FACTS FROM THE GROUP E GAME . Between the spy drone that was said to have flown over the French training camp last week and the goal-line cameras  used here on Sunday night, Honduras would probably argue that technology has done their World Cup bid no favours. They should perhaps blame themselves, too, for an over-physical approach that ultimately proved their undoing, Wilson Palacios becoming embroiled in a 45-minute wrestling match with Paul Pogba and getting himself sent off. His second yellow card, earned for a stupid challenge on the towering Juventus midfielder inside the area, was the decisive moment of the match. There have been some controversial penalties in this tournament already but this was not one of them, Karim Benzema stepping up to secure the first-half advantage France deserved. But the circumstances surrounding what appeared to be Benzema’s second — it was given as an own goal three minutes after the break — could be a source of argument long after this encounter concluded. VIDEO Scroll down to watch France fans enjoying their side's victory against Honduras . Was it in? Karim Benzema starts to celebrate, believing he has made it 2-0 to France against Honduras . Controversial: At first, goal-line technology showed it wasn't at goal, but it was looking at the wrong angle . Proof: But on second glance, the proof was there that the ball HAD crossed the line . Desperate: Noel Valladares tries to stop the ball going in, but it went down as an own goal from the goalkeeper . Complaining: The Honduras players weer sure that the goal shouldn't have been allowed . France (4-1-2-2-1): Lloris 6; Debuchy 6, Varane 7, Sakho 6, Evra 6;  Cabaye 7 (Mavuba 65 6); Pogba 6 (Sissoko 57 6), Matuidi 7; Valbuena 8.5, Griezmann 8; Benzema 7. Booked: Evra, Pogba, Cabaye. Honduras (4-4-2): Valladares 4; Beckeles 6, Bernardez 5 (O Chavez 46 6), Figueroa 6, Izaguirre 6; Najar 5 (Claros 58 6), Garrido 6, Palacios 4, Espinoza 6; Bengston 5 (O Garcia 46 6) 6, Costly 5. Booked: Palacios, O Garcia. Sent off: Palacios (second yellow). Referee: S Ricci (Brazil) 6. Man of the match: Valbuena. It was some half-volley that Benzema . produced from a marvellous diagonal pass by Yohan Cabaye. But only after . the ball bounced off a post, across the face of goal and struck Noel . Valladares, the  Honduras goalkeeper, did it seemingly cross the . goal-line. The problem was what appeared on the big screen. The . declaration that it was ‘No Goal’ sparked wild celebrations among the 10 . men of Honduras but was clearly a judgment made on the position of the . ball before it reached Valladares. A second judgment soon followed. ‘Goal,’ the screen declared, Brazilian referee Sandro Ricci confirming . the strike he had actually awarded the moment it was scored. Presumably . he had received a buzz from his watch. It was a World Cup first. The . trouble was, pictures remained inconclusive to the naked eye and the . more they were shown on the screen, the more confused everyone became. Didier Deschamps was baffled and expressed his sympathy to Luis Suarez, . the coach of Honduras. At least there was no disputing who scored France’s third goal; a blistering effort from Benzema in the 72nd minute. Thump: Benzema made it 3-0, but not a hat-trick, with a fine effort into the roof of the net . Pride: The big forward was in fine form on Sunday night in Brazil . Patience: Karim Benzema put Les Bleus in front, converting a penalty just before half time . No chance: The goalkeeper is sent the wrong way by the Real Madrid striker . Sloppy: Wilson Palacios was sent off for a second bookable offence after needlessly bringing down Paul Pogba . A . match lacking national anthems — presumably because of some kind of . technical hitch — did not lack atmosphere, the Estadio Beira-Rio buzzing . with excitement thanks to the French fans. What everyone . anticipated, of course, was a physical contest from Honduras but France . collected the first booking after Patrice Evra’s naughty challenge on . Andy Najar. France looked strong, Pogba giving them an imposing . presence in midfield. Patrick Vieira sees much of himself in the former . Manchester United midfielder, modestly suggesting the 21-year-old has . been blessed with superior skill. Pogba certainly made his presence . felt in an aerial challenge with Palacios, the Honduras midfielder . coming off distinctly second best. When a free-kick from Mathieu . Valbuena was diverted into the path of Blaise Matuidi, his half-volley . was pushed against the bar by Valladares. The crossbar would then deny Antoine Griezmann after the Real Sociedad forward met a cross from Evra with a decent header. On-field battle: The duo clashed earlier in the game, resulting in two yellow cards . Petulent: After being stamped on, Pogba lashed out at Palacios, kicking him into the air . The . only concern, at least for Deschamps, was an apparent desire to meet . fire with fire. Pogba and Palacios were having a real battle, the Stoke . midfielder appearing to stamp on Pogba with the Frenchman then lashing . out — David Beckham-style — in response. Both were booked when at . least one red card could have been issued for a clash that sparked . something of a melee between the two sides. French opportunities kept coming, with Griezmann — who really excites their fans — consistently threatening. The . breakthrough came when Palacios crashed into the back of Pogba and gave . the Brazilian referee no option but to award the spot-kick and banish . the Honduran. Benzema converted stylishly. If Deschamps is pleased . with the result, he will be less impressed that his team picked up three . bookings, given he is a stickler for discipline. He is also sure to . note that Pogba was a little fortunate not to get sent off. Even so, he . will be encouraged by the display against some intimidation. And Greg . Dyke will be relieved too. After securing three points, the FA chairman . will be delighted that the ‘mass suicides’ across the English Channel . that he predicted are now unlikely to occur.

There are not too many finals that you go past three hours. ‘To look back seven or eight years and to think that I would be in that position, I would come through against an opponent that makes you play and hit and run and hits so many shots and recover in conditions that start from cold to being warm. ‘So much adversity is thrown at you, and I’m just proud I came through and I adjusted in all different situations and I end up with this (trophy).’ Double: It was her second win in Paris, after first lifting the title in 2012 .

"Jose Mourinho and Cesc Fabregas could yet turn out to be a match made in heaven following the Spaniard’s shock move £30million move to Chelsea. But the pair have not always seen eye-to-eye; far from it in fact. From London to Catalonia, Fabregas and Mourinho have had their run-ins. Their apparent disdain for each other even appeared to turn physical in 2011. Here, Sportsmail look at some of the incidents that’ll need brushing under the carpet in the coming months. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Fabregas training with his new Chelsea team-mate Torres . Close your eyes, Arsenal fans: Cesc Fabregas poses with his new Chelsea shirt after signing for £30m . February 2007 . The bad-blood between Mourinho and Fabregas seemed to have started at the Millennium Stadium during the 2007 Carling Cup final between Chelsea and Arsenal. Having watched John Terry take a brutal kick to the face which resulted in a hospital visit for the Blues captain, it seemed Fabregas was more interested in complaining to the referee about a piece of celery thrown onto the pitch when he was taking a corner. Then, in the midst of an injury-time melee which saw Kolo Toure, Jon Obi Mikel and Emmanuel Adebayor sent off, the Spaniard grabbed hold of Frank Lampard around the neck, starting a long-running feud. Even Mourinho ran onto the pitch to get involved.

Did Mourinho aim a kick at Fabregas in August 2011 during the Spanish Super Cup against Real Madrid? It looked that way. Directly in front of the dugouts, the midfielder was scythed down by Marcelo sparking a mass brawl. And TV replays of the incident appear to show the then Real Madrid boss aim a sly kick at Fabregas as he lie on the floor in pain. He didn’t look to make much contact with the midfielder. But he certainly made contact with with then Barca boss Tito Vilanova just moments later as Mourinho poked his opposite number in the eye. In the aftermath Mourinho branded Barca a ‘small team’. Did Jose kick him? Barca players rush to confront Mourinho while Fabregas lies prostrate on the pitch . Not seeing eye-to-eye: Mourinho and Fabregas must now put their past grievances behind them at Chelsea . February 2014 . You wonder what Fabregas made of Mourinho’s recent ‘specialist in failure’ comments in reference to Arsene Wenger. Despite the fact Wenger rejected the opportunity to re-sign Fabregas this summer, the pair maintain a close relationship. So how will the midfielder feel about playing for a manager who so incisively insulted a man he views as a father figure? And then, of course, will come the first time Fabregas is asked about Mourinho’s jibe. Just how will he answer? Rock and hard place. Mentor: Arsene Wenger (right) has been the biggest influence on Fabregas's career and they remain close . Best of enemies: Wenger and Mourinho have had a bitter rivalry ever since the Portuguese came to England . February 2014 . Fabregas told Mourinho to ‘shut-up’ earlier this year after the Chelsea manager said Manchester City would be facing ‘the worst Barcelona for many, many years’ in the Champions League. The Special One claimed City would have a chance of knocking Barca out of the Champions League because the Catalans are well below their peak. Fabregas didn’t take too kindly to the comments and after the Spanish club won the first leg of their last-16 tie with City 2-0 at the Etihad Stadium he hit back at Mourinho. ‘Some people were talking a bit too much before the game and now they have to shut up for a few days,’ Fabregas said.

"Click here to read Jon Dolan's assessment of whether former Arsenal man Fabregas will be welcomed to Stamford Bridge. Arsenal will pocket £5.6million from the sale of former Gunner Cesc Fabregas to Chelsea. The Spanish midfielder completed his return to London on Thursday in a £30m move from Barcelona, signing a contract in the region of £150,000-a-week. But the deal will also boost Arsenal's already healthy £100million transfer budget and enable them to pursue striker Mario Balotelli who is among manager Arsene Wenger's summer targets.

Sportsmail understands the payment made to Arsenal in relation to . Fabregas' move to Chelsea will come from the acceleration of all . performance clauses, as if they were achieved, from the original deal in . 2011. Arsenal snubbed the chance to re-sign their former captain but will still benefit from the sale of the 27-year-old to their rivals. And, in . announcing his return to the Premier League, Fabregas was quick to . underline the fact his former club rejected the chance to bring him back . to the Emirates Stadium. Fabregas came through the ranks at Arsenal, and went on to captain the side before returning to boyhood club Barcelona in 2011. Arsenal secured a first-option buy-back clause as part of the £35million deal which saw Fabregas return to Catalonia. Gunners boss Arsene Wenger had considered taking up the option once it became clear Barca were looking to sell the midfielder.

And . the ex-Arsenal captain was at pains to point out that it was Arsenal's . decision to end any potential reunion, and not vice versa. 'Firstly . I would like to thank everyone at FC Barcelona where I enjoyed three . wonderful years. It was my childhood club and I will always be proud and . honoured that I had a chance to play for such a great team. Right move? Fabregas believes signing for Jose Mourinho's side was the 'best choice' 'I . do feel that I have unfinished business in the Premier League and now . is the right time for me to return.

"It is a lesson drummed into many of us as children, cheating simply does not pay. And for one deceptive pub landlord the consequences of breaking that golden rule turned out to be painful when he was ordered to run 10k holding a giant pumpkin he had bought but pretended he grew himself. Paul Koffman, 42, was desperate to win the vegetable growing competition he runs in his home town of Flintshire in Wales. But he suffered a setback when his pumpkins failed to grow so he decided to buy one instead, and pretend it was home-grown. Paul Koffman, 42, claims he was left covered in bruises after he was forced to run 10k with his offending fake pumpkin entry . However his fellow green-fingered competitors spotted the deception and decided to enforce their own version of punishment. The father-of two-was made to run more than six miles carrying the offending 14lb pumpkin throughout the streets of Flintshire for the town's 10k run. Not only was he left ashamed, but he claims the run left him battered and bruised. 'It was horrific carrying a 14-and-a-half pound pumpkin,' he said. 'Every eight steps or so I had to change the pumpkin’s position. Mr Koffman faked his pumpkin entry into the vegetable growing competition he runs every year in Flintshire . The offending fake home-grown pumpkin was left discarded at the end of the 10k race . 'I’m covered in bruises - it was absolutely horrendous. 'My shoulders and arms are really painful.' Mr Koffman organises the annual giant vegetable growing competition at his pub the Cross Keys at Llanfynydd, near Mold, North Wales. This year's challenge was to grow the largest pumpkin. About 360 runners took part in the 10k run. Mr Koffman came first in his age category and raised more than £100 for Nightingale House hospice. Laura Parry, the hospice’s area fundraising manager, said they were “absolutely thrilled” with Paul’s support.","Paul Koffman was desperate to win town's giant vegetable competition .

"Billy Joel has revealed that he has not made a hit album in 21 years because he hates modern celebrity culture. The 'Piano Man' singer said that he does not want to 'rip myself open and let everyone see everything' so is staying out of the studio. He described how he despises what he called the ‘horror of celebrity’ and said that he is no longer comfortable with the demands it places on an individual. Scroll down for video . Billy Joel told the New Yorker that he does not want to 'rip myself open and let everyone see everything' so is staying out of the studio . Joel, 65, had his last major album success in 1993 with River of Dreams, which reached no.3 in the charts in the UK and won the Grammy for Album of the Year. But since then he has become more known for his personal turmoil and has battled alcohol abuse and depression. In the last twenty years the culture of celebrity has changed dramatically too with the rise of social media meaning that there is ever more of a bleed between the personal and the private. In an interview with the New Yorker magazine, Joel, who has sold more than 150 million records, said that now he does not feel like he has ‘anything to prove any more’. Billy Joel pictured performing in his heyday back in 1978 . He said: ‘What I do have at this point is a horror of celebrity…. ‘...I was seeing it begin to happen when I was doing ‘River of Dreams.’ I had gone through this celebrity craziness with Christie (Brinkley, his ex-wife), and the divorce. ‘I felt like there was a proctoscope up my butt. ‘Everybody interrogating, analyzing - everything I wrote was fraught with meanings - and I said: ‘Wait a minute, I don’t want to rip myself open and let everyone see everything. It was no longer comfortable. Enough! I gave you enough!’ Joel added that it was easier to write material before he became famous as people ‘tend to draw their own conclusions’ from your music after you are a public figure. He said that he felt at that point ‘your image becomes more powerful than the things you create’. Joel has been married three times including to Brinkley, with whom he has a grown-up daughter.

In the interview he said that now there is ‘no fear’ in his life but that he has no desire to start recording again. Joel said that he is also turned off by the idea of working with ‘other people’, by which he meant arrangers and producers. He said: ‘I don’t want to deal with it. It’s a megillah. You have to have a certain amount of ambition to want to do all that. ‘And I look back at the guy who was the recording artist, this Billy Joel guy, and I think, Who the f*** was that guy? ‘He was very ambitious, very driven, and I don’t feel like that anymore.’","Legendary singer says he doesn't want to 'rip myself open and let everyone see everything'

Clint Dempsey scored after just 31 seconds and John Brooks powered in a header at the death as USA got their World Cup campaign off to a winning start against Ghana. The former Fulham frontman put Jurgen Klinsmann’s side ahead in the Group G clash, only for Andre Ayew to haul the Ghanaians level. However, substitute Brooks landed the decisive blow in the dying seconds when he headed a last-gasp winner. It ended a run of back-to-back defeats against Ghana after losing in the 2006 and 2010 World Cups and boosted their chances of qualifying for the knockout stages in Brazil.

The Texan, who had a disappointing loan . spell at Fulham last season, weaved his way through the Ghana defence . before firing past Adam Kwarasey off the right-hand post. Ghana creeped into the game and US keeper Tim Howard had to be alert to take the ball off Asamoah Gyan's toes. However, Jozy Altidore wasted a glorious chance to double USA's lead when his close-range shot was blocked by John Boye. That proved to be the Sunderland striker's last contribution as he pulled his hamstring shortly after and left the field on a stretcher. Ghana's Christian Atsu sent an effort over Howard's bar, but the Everton keeper had to get down low to beat away Gyan's long-range effort just after the half-hour mark. There was another injury scare for the US when Dempsey got caught in the face by Boye's flailing boot, but the Seattle Sounders forward dusted himself down and returned to the field after receiving treatment to a bloody nose.

Sulley Muntari flashed a long-range drive wide at the beginning of the second half, while Gyan headed over unmarked from eight yards. The Ghana captain almost made amends moments later, but his effort was turned around the post by Howard.

"Roy Hodgson is preparing to gamble with his future by playing Wayne Rooney in his favoured No 10 role in Thursday’s do-or-die World Cup clash with Uruguay. Rooney was restored to the position throughout the team’s 90-minute training session on Tuesday. Raheem Sterling played on the right and Danny Welbeck on the left. It is the strongest indication yet that Hodgson is prepared to play Rooney in the position where the  striker believes he can do most damage. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Drop the Rooney agenda - Lampard . In the hole: Wayne Rooney could be selected in the No 10 role for Thursday's clash against Uruguay . Rooney has scored 39 goals for England but has still to score in a World Cup after drawing another blank against Italy in the 2-1 defeat last Saturday. One player who looks likely to miss out is midfielder Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain after he continuedto train away from the group. England’s players also practised penalties again, with Rooney, Steven Gerrard, Frank Lampard, Rickie Lambert and Leighton Baines taking spot-kicks. Thursday night will go a long way to deciding whether they even reach the knockout stages Lampard backed Rooney to step up and dominate games. Lampard said: ‘He’s an exceptional player, and if we’re going to go on and do well in this World Cup, players like Wayne will come to the fore, because that’s what they do. ‘No matter how tough you are, if every time you read a paper or look at the TV and there are people debating your position, I don’t see that can be positive. ‘Until Wayne pops up with a goal, the column inches will keep happening but it’s frustrating.

"England have been forced to put one of their jetlagged late arrivals on standby for Saturday’s first Test against the All Blacks amid fears that Danny Care may become the latest key man to be ruled out. The Harlequins scrum-half suffered a shoulder injury in training and if he fails a fitness test at Eden Park, Ben Youngs will be promoted to wear the No 9 shirt, with Lee Dickson — who arrived in Auckland on Wednesday — on the bench. As he announced a weakened line-up with a total of just 299 caps in the starting XV, head coach Stuart Lancaster said: ‘Danny Care is a concern. He fell awkwardly in training on Monday, jarring his shoulder, and I’m giving him until the captain’s run on Friday. 'At the moment we’re hoping he’ll be fine but it’s meant I’ve had to put Lee Dickson on standby and Ben Youngs would start if Danny is out. It’s not ideal, but needs must.’ Plane crazy: England, pictured training at the Takapuna Rugby Club in Northcote on Thursday, forced to call on jetlagged Dickson as fears grow for Care ahead of first Test against New Zealand . Concerns: Danny Care (left) suffered a shoulder injury during training with Lee Dickson only arriving in New Zealand on Wednesday after lifting the Premiership at Twickenham . Brown, Yarde, Tuilagi, Eastmond, May, Burns, Care, Marler, Webber, Wilson, Launchbury, Parling, Haskell, Morgan, Robshaw . It certainly isn’t ideal. England will be desperate to avoid losing Care, a stand-out figure during their Six Nations campaign, while Youngs has endured a season of fluctuating form and Northampton’s Dickson may have to play seven days after appearing in his club’s Aviva Premiership final win. England go into the encounter with the world champions with an exciting but potentially vulnerable 10-12 combination. Freddie Burns will be preferred to Danny Cipriani at fly-half and his inside centre sidekick is Kyle Eastmond — who was out of favour at Bath during the last month of the season. While Manu Tuilagi will provide significant ballast at outside centre, the All Blacks will no doubt target his midfield team-mates by deploying the rampaging Ma’a Nonu to test their defensive resolve. Lancaster is adamant that his rookies can withstand the onslaught, saying: ‘They’ll be ready because it’s going to come their way. They’re going to be tested. In our system, Freddie has been good (defensively). We’ve had various back-line combinations in the past and we’ve always been solid. Credit goes to Andy (Farrell) for that. There’s nothing I’ve seen in training that has me lying awake worrying about it.’ Eastmond played both Tests against Argentina last June and impressed the management with his free-spirit exploits. The former St Helens rugby league player has not been selected since but Lancaster said: ‘Having worked with him in Argentina, where he got his first caps, he was exceptional on that tour and every time he’s trained with us we’ve seen huge potential in him. The partnership of him and Manu has been looking promising in training. Plunged into action: Ben Youngs could play at scrum half if Care fails to make the cut . ‘As a midfield partnership it’s nicely balanced. It’s still got that ball-playing 12 that I prefer to have, someone to distribute and make good decisions and it’s got the power runners as well. We need to give Kyle the licence to do what he does best — that’s put people through holes — but also encourage him to take on players himself as he’s a genuine running and passing threat.’ Burns is another creative force when he is on his game, which was not often last season as the saga of his move from Gloucester to Leicester left his confidence in tatters. England need him to regain his strut quickly and Lancaster insisted he has done so, having been told that the absence of George Ford left him on track to start the first Test. ‘That started back in England,’ said the head coach. ‘As soon as the George Ford scenario unfolded the message to Freddie was “I know you’ve been disappointed with your own form but you need to understand that there’s a very good chance you’ll be starting this first Test. You need to get your head round it and make sure you’re going to be on the money if it comes”. The acid test: Stuart Lancaster (left) takes England to New Zealand to face the might of the All Blacks . ‘If he trained well and put his best foot forward [I told him] he would be starting. He’s taken it with both hands. He’s been excellent. By giving him the notice early it’s allowed him to mentally prepare and as a consequence he has led the team well.’ The coaches have been paying particular attention to enhancing confidence to compensate for the personnel problems. England have able deputies but some are alarmingly short of recent game-time, such as Rob Webber. Geoff Parling is preferred to Dave Attwood as the lock in charge of the lineout operation, while James Haskell’s superb form for Wasps forced him ahead of Tom Johnson to start at blindside flanker.Further back, Marland Yarde is recalled on the right wing. ‘I think it’s a strong side,’ said Lancaster but he will relish naming a far stronger one next week.","Lee Dickson is on standby for Saturday's Test despite only arriving in New Zealand on Wednesday .

A West Java court sentenced Jake Drage, 23, to nine months in jail for the June crash that claimed the life of a local mother, Kokom . While prosecutors pressed for 18 months jail, Drage will only serve another six after being in the West Java jail for three months already. Kokom's husband Iim, has further expressed that he sees her killer as  his son, and has attended each of Drage's six court appearances, in disbelief at how it ever came to this. Mr Iim never wanted the ex-personal trainer charged, and doesn't blame him for the collision that threw his wife off the back of a motorbike controlled by their teenage daughter, Mela. 'I care about him so much ... he's like our son,' he said . 'It's too sad what's happening with him. Many times, I can't help myself and I cry on seeing him.' Prosecutors in the case have argued Drage was overtaking a small truck at such a speed it made the crash unavoidable. They have argued for 18 months jail. Jake Drage in the courtroom with his translator and his distraught mother . Drage had been in Sumatra before his Indonesian adventure took him to the surfing town of Cimaja, West Java. On his second day there, he says, he rescued a woman from Jakarta who was in trouble in the surf. He was on his way to see her again, on his third day in town, when Mela's bike appeared in his path. Their handlebars clipped, flinging Kokom on to the road. Drage's trial heard how on seeing the blood on the asphalt, he screamed 'Oh my God'.

Mr Iim says the fact the Drage didn't try to dodge responsibility counts for everything . For Mr Iim, the fact this young Aussie didn't try to dodge responsibility counts for everything. 'He didn't run away, they've helped us with many things, that's enough for us,' he said. Mr Iim's relative Andika Hidayat was called to help Drage after the crash because no one else could speak English, including the police. On meeting the distraught Australian, he says he 'just knew' he was a good person. Until Drage's Western Australia-based mother Tiena arrived with a lawyer, Mr Andika ensured Drage was coping in police custody, sending food and company. Tiena Drage has also been sheltered by the community throughout the four-month ordeal. She first reached out to Mr Iim's family to pay for the funeral, but their friendship has grown since. At the most recent court date, they sat as one group, chatting and joking to lighten the mood. Mr Andika says for him, it makes sense for the families to unite. Sixteen-year-old Mela is missing a mother, and Ms Drage is missing her child. 'It's like all the children have a new mum because she's like mum to them,' he said. 'But three and a half months Jake's been in jail now. In my opinion, he shouldn't be.' Drage had faced a maximum six years in jail and a possible maximum fine of $1100.","Jake Drage, from Geraldton, Western Australia, has been in custody since the June 30 crash which claimed the life of West Java woman Kokom .

"Ed Miliband is under intense pressure to agree to two inquiries into Labour’s health service in Wales. As the Daily Mail’s investigation into allegations of appalling failings of Welsh patients dominated Prime Minister’s Questions, David Cameron accused Labour of causing the crisis by slashing NHS funding. He told MPs that the British Medical Association and even some Labour MPs were now calling for a public inquiry in Wales into claims of neglect, long waiting lists and poor access to lifesaving treatments. Facing questions: Ed Miliband at Prime Ministers' Questions yesterday, where he heard even some Labour MPs are calling for a public inquiry into the state of the Labour-run Welsh NHS - the focus of a Mail investigation . The Prime Minister also challenged Labour leader Mr Miliband to allow a separate review by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development to go ahead. The international body wants to compare health services in the four nations of the UK. The Prime Minister rejected the Labour leader’s claim that the health and social care systems in England are at ‘breaking point’, with ‘millions of people unable to see their GP’ and ‘the longest waits in A&E for ten years’. Mr Cameron said under the Coalition, 1.3million more outpatients are being treated by 2,500 more nurses and 8,000 more doctors. ‘A record we can be proud of,’ he said. ‘Why? Because we invested in the NHS, they cut the NHS in Wales.’ Strain: Ed Miliband is under intense pressure to agree to two inquiries into Labour’s health service in Wales . The fourth day of the Mail’s investigation reveals how: . Yesterday the Liberal Democrats also attacked Labour’s record, accusing the party of ‘wrecking’ the NHS in Wales. Norman Lamb, the party’s health minister, said: ‘Labour will not back an independent OECD study into the NHS in Wales is because they are scared of the outcome. ‘Ed Miliband and [shadow health secretary] Andy Burnham refused to protect NHS funding in this Parliament and they can’t be trusted with it in government again.’ Mr Cameron said under the Coalition, 1.3million more outpatients are being treated by 2,500 more nurses and 8,000 more doctors. 'A record we can be proud of,’ he said. ‘Why? Because we invested in the NHS' Welsh Secretary Stephen Crabb said: ‘It’s quite wrong of the Welsh Labour Party to seek to shut down debate and shut down scrutiny…when it comes to the most important issue for the people of Wales.’ Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt upped the pressure on Mr Miliband by writing to him urging him to support the OECD study ‘according to the timetable that was previously agreed with the Welsh health minister’. He added: ‘These are the facts about the Labour-run NHS in Wales today: The health budget was cut by 8 per cent; the last time A&E targets were met was in March 2008; the eight-minute ambulance response time target has been met once since May 2012.’ A senior Labour source said: ‘What we have here is a politically-motivated smear campaign by a Prime Minister who has forgotten his job is to save the NHS.’ The source said Labour had made clear it is willing for the OECD to review the health service’s record in Wales, but was concerned the Tories would use draft findings for political purposes. Last night, ambulance service trust chief Tracy Myhill apologised to patients and families ‘whose experience of our services has been unacceptable’ and she insisted that performance was improving.","PM said BMA and even some Labour MPs are calling for public inquiry .

"Divorce papers filed by the wife of Matt Lauer nearly a decade ago which came out this week accuse the popular morning show host of some shocking behavior. Annette Lauer filed the papers in 2006 stating that Matt valued his work over his family and was 'extremely controlling.' Furthermore, Annette claimed at the time she suffered 'cruel and inhuman' treatment at the hands of her husband, who also demonstrated 'extreme anger and hostility towards her.' Scroll down for video . Not a pretty picture: In divorce paprs filed in 2006, Matt Lauer's wife Annette (above) said her husband was 'extremely controlling' It gets worse: Annette also claimed at the time that she suffered 'cruel and inhuman' treatment at the hands of her husband . The papers, obtained by The National Enquirer, also say that, 'The conduct of [Matt] so endangers the physical and mental well-being of [Annette] so as to render it unsafe and improper for plaintiff to cohabit with defendant.' The couple had two sons at the time these papers were filed, Jack, then 5, and Romy, then 2, and would welcome a third child, Thijs,just two months later. Annette, 48, a former model who was born in the Netherlands, married the Today host in 1998, just one year after he was made a co-anchor of the show, a job that now earns him a reported $25 million a year. The papers also allege, 'Defendant has continuously and repeatedly given higher priority to … personal interests than to his family obligations to plaintiff, causing plaintiff to feel abandoned, isolated and alone in raising the parties’ children.' Lastly, Annette said she endured 'continual mental abuse' from Matt. Matt filed his own legal action days later, saying any 'cruel and inhuman treatment' he may have exhibited was 'provoked' by his wife. A source close to the couple said of the papers, 'These divorce papers were filed more than eight years ago and revoked three weeks later. In New York at that time, irreconcilable differences could not be considered grounds for divorce. A spouse had to prove cruel and in-humane or unsafe treatment, which meant that lawyers had to use those exact terms to establish grounds.' That same source added, 'Matt and Annette just happily celebrated their 16-year wedding anniversary over dinner with their three children.' Still going: The couple (left) just celebrated their 16-year wedding anniversary. Matt was briefly engaged to Kristen Gesswein (right). All work: Matt makes a reported $25 million a year as the co-anchor of Today . Matt's first marriage, to television producer Nancy Alspaugh, ended in divorce in 1988. He was also briefly engaged to television newscaster Kristen Gesswein, but they split in 1996, two years before he married Annette. NBC has yet to respond to a request for comment about these papers.","In divorce papers filed by Annette Lauer in 2006, Matt Lauer is described as 'extremely controlling' and accused of 'cruel and inhuman treatment'

But Historic Royal Palaces said today that it was always the intention to begin sending the poppies - which have been sold to raise cash for charity - to their new owners after Armistice Day on November 11. A spokeswoman said: 'We have been overwhelmed by the support from the public for Blood Swept Lands And Seas Of Red, our installation of ceramic poppies in the moat at the Tower of London. 'It has always been intended that the poppies will be in place until November 11 and after this time they will be cleaned and sent out to all those that have purchased them. 'The transience of the installation is key to the artistic concept, with the dispersal of the poppies into hundreds of thousands of homes marking the final phase of this evolving installation. 'We are currently planning further ways in which the Tower of London will be marking the coming years of the centenary and the legacy of the poppies in the moat.'

Rehema Figueiredo, 23, from Balham, south London, who bought two, said she was expecting to receive hers not to long after Remembrance Day to pass them on as gifts. 'I bought two as presents for people who had relatives that were lost in the war and they will be most upset that they won't get their poppies in time. 'I bought mine maybe a month and a half ago so I've already been waiting that long for it to come and it's a bit disappointing to think that we will be waiting even longer.' The public were urged to postpone their visits to the poppy field last week due to overcrowding during the school half-term holiday. Phil Hufton, London Underground's chief operating officer, said Tower Hill station near the memorial had been 'extremely busy' and occasionally the station was being closed on police advice. Each night at sunset, the Last Post is played and a Yeomen Warder reads out the names of some of the Commonwealth soldiers who gave their lives in the First World War .

One beneficiary from the sale of the poppies, military charity SSAFA, backed the closure of the exhibition next week. A spokeswoman said: 'Its transience is part of the overall artistic concept.

"ESPN has suspended one of its most popular columnist for three weeks after he called NFL commissioner Roger Goodell a liar in a profanity-laced rant then dared the sports network to discipline him. ESPN, which is a corporate partner of the National Football League and airs Monday Night Football each week, now faces intense criticism from millions of furious fans, who have made #freesimmons the No. 1 trending topic on Twitter. In his weekly podcast, the BS Report, Simmons ranted that Goodell was lying when he claimed that he had not seen the video of Ray Rice punching his wife in the face before it was leaked to the public by TMZ earlier this month. 'Goodell, if he didn't know what was on that tape, he's a liar. I'm just saying it. He is lying. I think that dude is lying,' Simmons said - becoming increasingly agitated as he spoke. Scroll down for audio . Suspended: Bill Simmons, one of the ESPN's most popular sports commentators, is off the air for three weeks after his rant against NFL commissioner Roger Goodell . 'If you put him up on a lie detector test that guy would fail. For all these people to pretend they didn't know is such f****** bull s***. It really is, it's such f****** bull s***. And for him to go in that press conference and pretend otherwise, I was so insulted. I really was.' The NFL initially suspended Rice, a Baltimore Ravens running back, just two games after was arrested for knocking his then-fiance unconscious and dragging her out of an elevator at a hotel in Atlantic City, New Jersey. When the video of the attack emerged two weeks ago, fan outrage over the light discipline grew to a fever pitch. Goodell and team officials claimed they had never seen the punching video and responded by kicking Rice off the Ravens and banning him from the league for life. As Simmons ranted, he turned his attention to his employer, saying: I really hope somebody calls me or emails me and says I’m in trouble for anything I say about Roger Goodell. Because if one person says that to me, I’m going public. 'You leave me alone. The commissioner’s a liar, and I get to talk about that on my podcast. … Please, call me and say I’m in trouble. I dare you.' ESPN apparently took the bait and suspended Simmons, who is the editor of the sports site Grantland and the co-creator of ESPN's 30for30 documentary series. Under fire: NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell has been facing calls to resign since new video emerged of Baltimore Ravens running back Ray Rice punching his then-fiance in the face . The sports network, which is owned by Disney, yanked the podcast from its website and issued a statement about Simmons: . 'Every employee must be accountable to ESPN and those engaged in our editorial operations must also operate within ESPN's journalistic standards. 'We have worked hard to ensure that our recent NFL coverage has met that criteria. Bill Simmons did not meet those obligations in a recent podcast, and as a result we have suspended him for three weeks.' Simmons' peers and fans have responded with jeers and calls for boycotting ESPN. Fury: Simmons' peers and fans lashed out at ESPN for silencing the columnist - causing #freesimmons to briefly become the No. 1 hashtag on Twitter . Wow, I guess someone actually CAN get swiftly and harshly punished for a recording that reflects poorly on the NFL,' Time magazine TV critic James Poniewozik tweeted. Washington Post reporter Wesley Lowery demanded to know: 'What exact 'journalistic standard' did Bill Simmons - a personally branded columnist and analyst - violate? Speaking ill of the NFL?' 'Bill Simmons: Suspended by ESPN for saying what LITERALLY every person was already thinking and saying,' one Twitter commentator said. Many pundits pointed out that Simmons' punishment was harsher than Rice's original suspension. And it was harsher than the one-week suspension for ESPN anchor Stephen A. Smith, who said women can be responsible for provoking men into domestic violence. 'All you need to know about ESPN: Stephen A Smith says women need to stop provoking men = 1 week. Simmons says Goodell is lying = 3 weeks,' Fox Sports columnist Jimmy Traina said.","Simmons, one of ESPN's most popular stars, dared ESPN to discipline him on during rant on his podcast .
